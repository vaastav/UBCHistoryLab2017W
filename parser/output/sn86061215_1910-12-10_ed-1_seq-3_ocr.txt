In his annual report of the volume and value of the nation's crops, made public today, Secretary of Agriculture Wilson declares that "at no time in -the world's history has a country pro 1 duced farm products within one year with a value reaching $8,926,000,000, .. which is the value of the agricultural ^products of this country for 1910." ^Secretary Wilson gives an astounding 'array of figures showing the value of the crops of corn, cotton, hay, wheat and oats, and then he follows with a paragraph to show the consumer that the farmer Is not making all the money that is taken from the soil, nor is the farmer responsible for high prices. The secretary says: "The farmer supplies the capital for .production and takes the risk of his losses his.crops are at the faercy of drought, and flood, and heat, and frost, to say nothing of noxious insects and blighting diseases. 'He supplies hard, exacting, unremitting labor. A degree and range of information and intelli gence are demanded by agriculture which are hardly equaled in any other occupation. Then there, is the risk of overproduction and disastrously low prices. From beginning to end the farmer must steer dextrously to escape ^^perils to his pjroflts, and Indeed to his ^capital, on every hand. At last the ^.products are started on their way to the consumer. The railroad, generally speaking, adds a percentage of in crease to the farmer's prices that is not large. After deliyery by the rail road the products are stored a short time, are measured into the various re tail quantities, more or less small, and .the dealers are rid of them as soon as possible. The dealers have risks that are practically small, except credit sales, and such risks as grow out of their trying to do an amount of busi ness which is small as compared with their number." Secretary Wilson cites tlffe various DR. BONHAM 1 SPECIALIST CHRONIC DISEASES.

Elks Building OTTUMWA, IOWA percentages of the consumer's prices for farm produce received by the farmer to illustrate his point. He re views investigations made by the de partment in seventy-eight cities of prices the farmers received and the consumers paid for certain staple articles. In the case of milk, the secre tary says, the farmer receives a scant 50 per cent of the price paid by the consumer. The railroads get abmit 7 per cent and the remaining 43 per cent goes to the retailer. But, the re tailer he explains, has a heavy ex pense to bear. He explains: "The milk wagon of the retailer has a long route. It stops at a house or two in, one city block, perhaps passes several blocks without stopping, and so proceeds to serve customers thinly distributed along a route of miles. At the same' time the milk wagons of other retailers are covering various portions of the same route, and so there is a great waste of effort and of expense in the distribution." Other discrepencies between the prices paid to the producer, and the prices paid by the consumer are brought out by the secretary's report, which says: "The farmer receives hardly more than half of the consumer's price in the case of poultry 69 per cent in the case of eggs ctfbbage 48 per cent when bought by the head and 65 per cent when bought by the pound celery 60 per cent when bought by the bunch. "The apple grower receives 56 per cent of the consumer's price when the purchase is by the bushel and. 66 per cent when by the barrel the straw berry grower gets 49 per cent of the consumer's price in purchases by the quart and 76 per cent when by the crate. When the consumer buys a peck of onions at a time, the farmer re ceives 28 per cent of the retail price when he buys a barrel the farmer re ceives 58 per cent. So, in the case of oranges, when the purchase Is by the dozen the grower receives 20 per cent of the consumer's price, whereas, when the purchase is by the box the grower gets 59 per cent. The rule seems to be, the smaller the retail quantity the smaller the farmer's' share of the con sumer's price." Then the secretary offers what he thinks is the solution by asking the consumer why he does not buy di rectly from the farmer. He adds: "Why do not consumers buy directly from the farmers? A distribution of farm products in this simple way has already begun in England where co operative organizations of farmers, are selling by direct consignment to co operative organizations of consumers in cities. Farmers' co-operative selling associations are numerous in this country, but co-operative buying asso ciations among the people of cities and towns are few. Aside from buying as sociations maintained by farmers, hardly any exist in this country. It is apparent, therefore, that the consumer has much to do to work out his own salvation with regard to the prices that he pays. Potatoes were selling last spring in some places where there had been overproduction for 20 cents and in some places for even 9 cents per bushel at the farm, while at the same time city consumers in the east •Were paying 50 to 75 cents per bushel, although there was nothing to prevent them from qombining to buy a carload or more of potatoes directly from the grower and for delivery directly to themselves." INVESTING INSURANCE MONEY. Every man who has anyone depend ent upon him, should carry a reason able amount of life insurance. There are logical and business reasons for carrying life insurance, but it is not the intention here to make an argu ment for or against life insurance. This is assuming you are insured. We want to call attention to the necessity •of instructing those dependent upon you, how to invest the money they will' get in case of your death. It is something that every man should arrange for as nearly as he can. The man who has a life insurance policy of two, three, or five thousand dollars should instruct his family as to what he believes, is the best way to handle that money after his death. Three thousand dollars at 6 per cent interest, will give an income of fifteen dollars a month and have the prin cipal left. Three thousand dollarfe flapping at the loose end of a check book, in the hands of a person inex perienced in business, is liable to g» so fast that in a few months there will be nothing left of it but the remark, "Where did it go!" If you are carrying a few thousand dollars life insurance, for your fam ily, just take the matter up with them, talk it over and instruct them in the way to make the best use of it. You cannot expect people who have had no business experiences whatever, to make a good business deal without some instruction. This is especially true at the time when the family is grief stricken by the loss of one of its members. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Taft in his message to congress indicated that there would be no tariff legislation in the present short session. It is not likely, he said, that the tariff board will be able to re port on any of the schedules during this, session, because of the enormous amount of work involved in preparing such a report, but he hopes to be able to submit to the next congress facts determined by the tariff board. A«j I11 this connection the president recom mends that the tariff board already ap pointed be made a permanent tariff commission. In taking such a step this country would only be adopting a plan which has been successfully pur sued by other governments whose tar iff matters are in the hands of men who have made this study their life work. A portion of the message in which the 'president may feel a justifiable pride is that section relating to the reduction in expenditures during his administration. The final estimates for the year ending June 30, 1912, are nearly $53,000,000 less than the ap propriations for the year ending June 30, 1911. The estimates of expend itures were scaled down below the estimated receipts so as to insure a surplus of ordinary receipts over ordi nary expenditures of about 150,000,000. The reduction in the postal deficit is another matter in which the president may take pride. The president again calls attention ^?^i£'J"-* f." '"S^•h#1! to the need of reformirfg the judicial procedure, referring particularly to the burden placed upon the supreme court by unnecessary appeals. In this connection he advocates increasing the salaries of judges of the higher courts in order that the judical service may be able to command the best talent in the legal profession in every part of the country. The adoption of the parcels post on rural delivery roiites, and the build ing up of our merchant marine ir the interest of further trade expansion are further recommendations of the president. The president's message is of the same character as other former pub lic documents—clear and concise, without frills or furbelows. He would have congress devote its attention to aiding the work of the departments in the enforcing of present laws, and to legislating with an aim of giving greater opportunities for home and foreign commerce and the "strengthen ing of confidence of capital in do mestic investment." There is a constructive tone to the message that is the one thing the con gress and the people of this country should give the greatest heed to at this time. A St. Louis man has invented a soup spoon which he guarantees will prevent "that whistling noise which ac companies the intake from the spoon now in use." The inventor adds "that one cannot inhale soup through his spoon and make a noise at the same time." Having fixed it so that soup shall be seen and not heard, this, St. Louis party might try his hand at in venting a knife that would transport peas from the table to the mouth with out spilling them in transit. Having let the Christmas spirit lead you into providing those near and dear to you with the thingB they want —or that you think they want, says the Sioux City Journal—wouldn't you' like to have a hand in supplying those who are near and dear to others with things that they need and are not likely to get? The census shows 20,000,000 more mouths to feed, the Minneapolis Jour nal observes. And as most of the 40, 000,000 hands that go with the former number of mouths have not gone into farming, it partly explains the high prices. It is pleasant, says the Kansas City Journal, to reflect that however it may be with prize fighters, politicians and actors, there is one distinguished per son who can "come back." It is Santa Claus. Mary Garden's Salome must be the absolute limit when it is too strong for Chicago and Milwaukee. December is starting dandy little month. W's.m^

It hapened when they, first met-— the instant interest, eye flashing to eye, the feeling of having always know each other. The man's head went round a little and his heart beat very fast as he asked her for the dance he wanted. She did not have it to give, so he made the best of sitting against the wall and watching her glide over the floor with Lawton. Meantime he mentally thumped himself into sense. He knew on the spot that she was not the wife for him. Sam Morton, sen sible young business man, wanted a helpmate. He had come up in a "big family with a whining, weak mother and an overworked, harried father. He had even in boyhood determined on health and strength as tho only working basis to begin married life upon. Then he callcd himself a fool for let ting all this come to his mind at mefe sight of a young girl. For Lois was fragile and slender, a sort of lace-paper lady, he said to himself. Tl\at was just the word— she was appealing and delicate, and then, passing and catching his eve. she gave him a little smile that undid' all ^iis renunciatory work with him self in the past few moments. He could dance with her. anyway. And, fool that he was, nobody but himself had suggested his marrying her! Perhaps even if she were asked she would not *have him—he sudden ly felt humble. Perhaps she was en gaged—that was a startling thought maby she was engaged to Lawton— that was a jealous thought. He straightway despised his friend Law ton in his heart and accused him of inability to care for a frail fehild of a girl like Lois. Then he wondered how old she was—surely not twenty! And then, the waltz ending, he hurried to her to see if by chance she had not made a mistake about having no dance for him. His in sistence made her blush and waver. Finally she yielded him her pro gram and he crossed out Lawton's initials and put his own where they had been. After this he danced with the stupid girls he had thought at tractive an hour ago and waited until his turn came with her. This was a beginning of bad times for the young man, who surely, in precarious financial time^ needed all but prospering business. He vowed during the sleepless ig-enu of the In apparently good health, and ac tive as many people much younger, Nancy Miller Surber, 507 East Wil liams street, is lookiftg.forward to her hundredth birthday, which falls on next Tuesday December 13. The oc casion will be one of much rejoicing, and in the modest celebration that has been arranged for no one will be more active than the centenarian, Nancy Surber. Nancy Miller Surber was born De cember 13, 18,10 in Clinton county, Ohio and there she grew to woman hood. Early in 1835 she Was married to Andrew Surber, and to this union twelve children were born. Five are now living. There are Mrs. Ben Young 507 East Williams stree't, with whom Grandma Surber is now living, Mrs. Lovina Jaquinot of this city, Mrs. Martha Richie of Council Bluffs and two sons, George and William, who re side in Keokuk county. Mr. Surber died thirty-two years ago and grandma has always remained a widow. She is a devout Christian and has been a member of the Brethren church for sixty years. She has only lived in Ot tumwa four years, coming here from Hedrick. Her daughter, Mrs. Young, is now in her seventy-fifth year, but she can not be convinced by her night aftc the dar.^e that he would cut out merr -makm: Whence for ward and forget the "glri business." He changed his whole disturbed con dition to what Le aptly enough called the "marriage microbe"—three of his friends had lately married. He had helped at the functio* r.t the subse quent home celebrations, and some how the thing had got on his brain— he would sha!:e off- the idea. What did he want of marriage for a good five years, or three—or two. at least? nad a- flrst-class boarding place, which was expense enough until he was better settled with the store. Not that he was lit doing well, for he was. And when he did marry—this was, after all. the principal thing to re member—it must be to no lace-paper lady. He had once heard a man he knew call a frigile girl that, and It struck his rather, romatic fancy—a lace-paper lady—very, very pretty, to be looked at, but unfit for the stern wear and tear of everyday life. When three months had passed and he rad resolutely refused, and had in the end gone to, everything social where he knew or thought the girl might be. he was more than ever sure that he was right. But one thing a fine instinct had kept him from do ing—he had never asked any one a single question about her, and he was so fearful of showing his Interest that he went away if by chance she was mentioned by his friends. Thus all he knew of her he .gathered from her own lips—and .. she. was ..silent. .It seemed to hinv that .she was more silent with him than with others— Lawton, for-instance. At quite a large picnic, the last in the beautiful fall weather, it had seemed" to him that she fairly chat tered to Lawton, but when he after awhile found himself berlde. her, she was awkwardly shy. Thev had sat a little apart, from the rest while Pickie Jones discoursed some alleged music from a banjo and a loud but rather battered set of vocal cords. The wistful beauty of her face struck him as poignantly as pain her girlish slenderness called to his strength as for protection. Turning, she answered the. scrutiny she had been sensitive to by a fleet­ ing little smile. His heart "went fast and then something'like a veil floated a moment before his eyes—he could not see. When Pickie had finished his,rag time song, and the rest had applaud ed, he leaned closer to the «girl and asked if she would not like to go home early, walking part of the way, and whether he might not go with her. She hesitated. "I'm sorry—but I just promised Harry,"- she said, simply. But somehow, while his heart was hot that it should be Law ton again, he had for the first time an idea that perhaps sho really was. sorry He went home that night miserable to the core of his being. Tired _as he was. there was no sleep. An finally in the gray hours of the morning, peace came to him by a strange path it was through the self-verdict that he was an unutterable, sneaking cad of a coward! He rejoiced in calling himself names. Now he knew that love is—love! it takes you up and you-belong to it and cherish it your life long! You love—because you love, and if the lady of your heart be a tender plant, a fragile flower, you love her apd guard her the more because she needs you and your strength! It was all very clcB-r fmd'ni&d© nitn^ iU6u&Dly happy for two days and a night Then he awakened to new tortur,e! What use was anything if, while he had been hesitating, the other man had won her? This thpught made him sore. and sick, and he finished his day's work like an eyil, feverish dream. He hastened home to his boarding house swallowed his supper, and then with a lover's care fulness. made himself immaculate. He would go and se? her. But it was not until he was Starting that .he remembered -he did not know exactly where she lived. He had been keeping away from her, avoiding, mention of her. and here he was un able to find her! All he knew was wfyat he knew from- her—he asked her how she stood the heat downtown one September day of unseasonable heat and she had answered simply "I'm not downtown—I don't work— I stay at home." Of course she was a pampered child her appearance told-him-that. He had heard, he could not have' said where, that she had no mother, and lived with her father and- several- sis ters—he never saw the sisters-^-old maids who made a busfness of petting her, no doubt. He wondered if they V„A W s' South Ottumwa~Woman is Nearing Her One Hundredth Birthday Anniversary .'V GRANDMA NANCY SUBER. mother that she will reach her hun dredth birthdajr.

Finally he went to a drug store directory and found her street and number. And in the dusk of a warm Octo ber evening he found the little street and the little cottage where she lived. He saw no light, but he went up the winding path through the deep, tree guarded yard and to the Small, sim ple dwelling. Sitting alone on the small porch, he was aware of her, and that she arose and came toward him, timidly, until she saw who jt was. "You!" she breathed in a tone soft as a caress, while he took her hand, and stood holding it, though she would have withdrawn it. "Yes, I!" he replied in a tense voice. "Lois, I can't wait, to say' it prettily and work up to it—but I've been in torment since the first min ute I met you, because I—love you so, Lois! Can't you see that I've loved you so much that I could not trust myself to come near you for fear my heart would come out of me and drop to your hand! That first time I danced with you I came near telling you I'd give my soul jtyst'to kiss you once—I bit my tongue and managed to keep still! Now, girl, girl, could you marry me —could you trust me to take care of you? I won't let the wind blow on you event if you will give me my Chifince!" H6 paused, breathlessly, because, wonder of wonders, she was listen injg, aqd her gentle head was very near his shoulder—so near that he put his hand behind it and brought it close. And then he stopped and kissed her, and knew that her cheek was wet with tears. "Dear," he said, "what is it? Why are you crying?" and then she laughed and wiped her eyes, but her hands clung to him. "I'm laughing because you should think I need so much coddling—a girl 'who does all the work for a father and three little sisters! Father is going to marry again, and they're wild for a new mother—but I'm not!" Here she paused, but he remembered the tears. "But why were you crying? Tell me." But she was shy about it. "Well," she Anally said, "since you must "know It—I was glad. I had begun to think you—might—never— ask me!" And then the happy lover laughed and held the girl very close. EDDYVILLE.
