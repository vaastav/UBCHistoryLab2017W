The Democratic Advocate. WESTMINSTER. MD. FRIDAY AFTERNOON, DECEMBER 7,1906 The Late General Baughman. General Louis Victor Baughman died at his home, “Poplar Terrace” near Freder ick, on Friday last, at 2.10 a. m. in the 63d year of his age. He was the son of John W. Baughman, who for many years conducted that sterling Democratic paper, “The Frederick Citi zen’ ’ which since the death of the elder Baughman, has been carried on by his sons. General Baughman was one of the most widely known and highly esteemed citizens of Maryland, and was always prominent in the counsels and campaigns of the Demo cratic party of the State. He was a nat ural born leader, and having ample means and much time at his command, and hav ing a liking for public life, was a most ef fective factor in the politics of the State. He was at the very head of his party in Frederick county, and perhaps had more warm and devoted political friends there, than any man who ever lived in the county. And under the most discouraging circum stances, be has, by his untiring energy and tact, led the Democratic host to victo ry, in that naturally Republican county. When a very young man he went South and entered the Confederate Army, re turned after the war, and for the time de voted himself to the conduct of the “Citi zen. ’ ’ He subsequently married a daugh ter of the late A. S. Abell. He is sur vived by his widow and one son, Col. E. Austin Baughman, and one daughter, the wife of Dr. C. H. Conley. He has held several public positions from his party. He was Comptroller of the Treasury for two terms, and was also President of the Chesapeake & Ohio Ca nal Company, and one of the State Direc tors in the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. His chief ambition, however, was to be Governor of the State, and before his health declined, announced himself a can didate for that high office. It is believed, if his health bad remained firm he would have been the nominee of the party in 1907. And if so, he would have made the campaign a lively one from start to finish, and if elected he would have given the State a clean Democratic Administra tion, conducted for the good of the whole people, but upon straight Democratic lines. His death is deeply deplored by a wide circle of personal and political friends. His funeral took place from his home on Monday last and was one of the largest ever known in that city. The funeral services were held in St. John’s Catholic Church, of which he was a member. Dr. J. W. Bering, of this city, was among the honorary pallbearers. B. F. Crouse, Esq., and T. Herbert Shriver, Esq., also attended the funeral. Railroad Accidents. The accident on the Southern Railroad qn Thursday of last week, in which Mr. Samuel Spencer of New York, the Presi dent of the road, and Mr. Charles D. Fisher and Mr. Francis T. Redwood of Baltimore, and four others were killed and a number of persons were injured, has aroused much feeling throughout the country upon the subject of the care and protection due the travelling public by Railroad Companies. That there are accidents, involving the loss of life upon railroads, from unprevent able causes, we think is quite true. But it is the belief of many persons, who are not disposed to unduly criticise railroad management, that in many cases, lives are sacrificed because the rules and regula tions of the management have not been well matured, and especially because through carelessness upon the part of the employees, the rules are not ridgily ad hered to. In the case of the recent accident upon the Southern Railroad, the blame seems to attach to the man in the Block Signal Station, in permitting a train to enter the block before the preceding train had passed out of it. Scarcely enough has been pub lished to justify an opinion upon the subject. But if it should be so, that the second train was allowed to enter before the block was clear, it would be a flagrant and criminal violation of what we suppose to be the rule of the company. The Railroad Companies are bound by every consideration of self interest, of hu - manity and of ultimate responsibility, to insure, as far as possible, the safety of passengers travelling upon their lines. And to this end they should put the most trust worthy men in positions where great re sponsibility attaches, and where the safety of the public is so much involved. And then, their employees should not be overburdened by excessive hours, pro- I during physical exhaustion and thereby 1 rendering them unfit for useful and careful i service. The men in the block stations should be picked men, picked for their in- j tegrity and good habits, well paid and ■ given short hours, and then held to the ' strictest accountability for the proper dis charge of their duties. And, indeed, the same thing should apply to every depart ment of railroad work that involves the safety of passengers, who confidingly enter the trains, and who have a right to demand 1 that they should not be needlessly slaught- j ered. 1 We are glad to note the fact that the j Western Maryland Railroad has, in the past, been singularly free from accidents to j their passenger trains. Except for the 1 terrible accident, a year or more ago, they j have never had an accident of a very I serious nature. A number of wrecks have 'j occurred upon the road during the past * summer with their freight trains. But j when we consider that so many trains have ' been moving on a single track, and exten- * sure repairs .have been going on at the same time, it is not to be wondered at that \ these wrecks have occurred. I But as the read progresses in the splendid j which seems to be before it, and with 1 Anttfipe new trains, it is due to the public ( robbing fbfcrst regulations known to rail- I They also - ( adherence to j fqf every one in j the company’s employ. It is said, ‘ ‘familiarity begets contempt. Whether this is so or not, it is certainly so that familiarity begets carelessness, and this should be carefully guarded against by every man who has the lives of other people in his charge. The man in the railroad engine or in the signal station, who through carelessness causes the death of a passenger, is guilty of murder. We believe there is no part of the pub lic service in which there is a higher order of ability, than in the management of our great railroad corporations. But the men with whom the public are mostly concerned, are the men who start the trains, who signal the trains and who run the trains, and the men who open and shut the switches. The men in the management deal mostly with dollars and cents, while the men in the engines and signal stations and at the switches, deal with human lives. These are the men the public want to see sober, reliable and capable and well paid. Trade at Home. The Advocate presents to its readers in this issue a review of many of the en terprises in the wholesale and retail lines that have created for Westminster pro nounced popularity as a trade center, and which constantly maintain buying facilities and advantages independent of, because equal to, the large cities of the country. The object of giving the widest possible publicity to our trade advantages is to direct attention to the enterprise of our merchants and business men who have labored hard and earnestly to secure the excellent conditions that arise from large and complete stock equipments in all lines of merchandising, and which are found today in Westminster. The Advocate gives its hearty support and co-operation to such favorable publicity, not only of Westminster’s trade advantages, but also of Carroll county’s present standing and continued progress along all lines. For it is to be remembered, that publicity of our advantages begets inquiry and appre ciation which are invariably followed by activities that secure to the community at large greater results. The Westminster edition of this week will be followed in the near future by a write up of Carroll county and its towns, and the same generous co operation which characterizes this issue is already assured. The President’s Message. The President sent his annual message to Congress on Tuesday last. It is a voluminous document, and treats upon a great variety of subjects. It is written in the vigorous style of Mr. Roosevelt, and is bold, aggressive and radical. Many of its recommendations will lead to much dis cussion in Congress. We will refer to some of the subjects of the message, in these columns, at a later date. Wadding Balls.
