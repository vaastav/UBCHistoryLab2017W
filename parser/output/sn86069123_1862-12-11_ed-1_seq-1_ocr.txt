The liitte Election in Ens hind Presi dent Lincoln' Arbitrary A r rots Opinion of the London Time . We have come to the end of the second yearof the great war for the Union" Misery beyond conception has fallen on a large sec tion of people; the most flourishing regions have been laid waste; the bodies of tens of Artemns Ward in Canada. I'm at present existiu' tinder a monikad form of Gov'nient. In other words, I'm travalio' among the crowned heads of Cana da. They ar'nt pretty bad people. Oa the cont'ry, they are exceedin' good people. Troo, they are deprived of maay blessins. They don't enjoy, for instans, tha priceless boon of a war. They havn't any American Egil to onchaio, and they bain't sot a Forth of July on their back. Altho' this is a monikal form of Gov'men I I am ooable to perceive much monaky. I tried to git a piece in Toronto, but failed to succeed. Mrs. Victoria, who is Queen of England, and has all the luxuries of the market, in cludin' game in its season, don't bother her self much, about Canady, but lets her do bout as ehe's migher. She, however, gin' rally kept her supplied with a lord, who's called a Gov'nsr Gin'ral. Sometimes the politicians of Canady make it lively for old fogyish, but chock full of interest. Young gentlemen of a romantic turn of mind who are bothering their heads as to how they can spend their father's money, had better see Quebeck. Although I like Canady, good people and lots of pretty girls, I wouldn't mind comin over here to live in the capacity of a Duke, provided a vacancy occurs, and provided further I ceuld be allowed a few star span gled banners, a eagil, a boon of liberty, ect. I don't think I've skedadled. Not at all. I'm coming home in a week. Let us have the Union restored as it was if we can; but if we can't, I'm in favor of the Union as it wasn't. But the Union anyhow.

President's Message. Fellow- Citizens of the Senate And House of Representatives: Since your last annual assembling, another year of health and bountiful harvests has pass ed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light, lie gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise ways, all will be well. The correspondence touching foreign affairs, which has taken place during the last year, is nerewitn submitted, in virtual compliance with United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried into execution. A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, sub ject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia, and a similar negotiation is now pending with the Republic of llaytL A considerable improve ment of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures. Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Swelen, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European States remain undisturbed.

In the month of June been no change of our previous relations with the independent Mates ol our own continent, but more friendly sentiments than have here tofore existed are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with ours.

The civil war, which has so radically changed, for the moment, the occupation and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social conditions and affected, very deeply, the prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce, that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of hall' a century. It lias, at the same time, excluded political ambitions and appre hensions, which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation, we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign States, and between parties or factions in such Stales. We have attempted no propagandism, j 1 and acknowledged no revolution.

The statutes, decisions, records, and all the documents of law and justice, have, of necessity, been res..ected by all civiiizd invaders. Their destruction. anvng other evils, involves in utter chaos the validity of have left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign nations, with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exagger ated effects, and the consequence resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, com plaint on the part of this Government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise. The treaty with Great Britain lor the sup pression of the African slave trade has been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majesty's (Jovernmei.t has been marked by ajealous respect for the authority of the United States and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. The Convention with Hanover for the abo lition of the State dues has been carried into lull effect undjr the act of Congress for that purpose. A blockade of three thousand miles of sea coast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial ac tivity liko the .icacnt without coinmittio oc casional mistakes and inllicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their sub jects. A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade, under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruit ful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and, possibly, to produce mutual reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. 1 n clear cases of these kinds. 1 have, so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases, up on which the Government is unable to agree with the Governments whose protection is de manded by the claimants. There are, more over, many cases in which the United States or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, which the Government of these States arc not at once prepared to redress. 1 have proposed to some of the foreign States thus interested,) ' , .1 .: . :.. i ...i:.. i. ' and s burdens of the people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraor dinary measures to promote that end can not be adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective, in a scientific ex ploration of the mineral regions in these Ter ritories, with a view to the publication of its results at home and in foreign countries re sults which can not fail to be auspicious. Tbe condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast expenses incident to the military and naval operations required lor the suppression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a pronipitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field, demandyour best reflections as to the best means of providing the necessary revenues without injury to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor. The suspension of specie payment by the banks, soon alter the commencement of your last ses sion, made large, issues of United States Notes unavoidable, f n no other way could the pay ment of the troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, be so economically and as well provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the reccivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and mak ing them a "legal tender" for other debts, has made them universal currency, and has satis fied, partially, at least, and for the time, the long-felt wat of an uniform circulating medi um, saving thereby to the people immense sums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with a due regard to all interest should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are always injurious, and to reduce these Uuctua tions to the lowest possible point will always be a leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain converti bility into coin, is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them, and it is extremely doubtful whether a circu lation of United States .Notes, payable in coin, . . . rr. - i i , pie, can be per " 1 . i ; .i-":"""" maintained.
