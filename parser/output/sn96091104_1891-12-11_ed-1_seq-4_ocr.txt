These things help to make life on. the farm much more satisfactory than can be withoul them. . If you transplant any trees next Br.riT.r take the precaution to prune the branches so as to restore the rest destroyed by the root mutilations that are always inseperable from re movais, and the mulch so as to retain moisture until the new rootlets can get a good start Many trees are lost by neglecting the proper cutting back, thus leaving too much work for tht crippled roots to accomplish. The scarcity of food in Kussia Is said to have prevented the sowing of the full acreage of small grain during the recent planting season. The peasants, fearing famine, kept back for food every thing that they possi bly could. This will, of course, oper ate against a full crop the coming sea son, and to some extent again pre vent Russia from becoming our com petitor in the graiu markets of the world. ' In making or using a sheep dip care should be taken to avoid such a contain lime. If the dip la used im mediately after shearing the caustic properties of. .the lime will harden th skin and prevent the growth of wool for some considerable time. If used some time after shearing, and when the fleece has made a good growth again, the lime will Injure the fiber of the wool, i These facts should bt made widely known, as we see cer tain formulas are recommended to farmers to prepare for themselves which contain lime largely. A little money spent in horse blankets about this time may prove a good investment, as It not ouly would add to the comfort and well-being oi the horses, but would result in a oou frUI arable saving of feed. If stock 1m suffering from the cold their natural inbtiuct will prompt them to pull at all the fuel that they can put luside of their bodies, but this is an expensive way to keep them warm. Go out to the stable some of these cold morn ings, and If you see the horses shiver ing then hitch up aud go to town a fst as you can aud get some blankets for them.

'Wie storage lon room should be drv as well as cool. and if the fruit has been carefullj Picked and stored, wormy as well a bruised specimens being throwu out, and the apples packed iu boxes m barrels In some flue dry material, Mich as chaff or excelsior, there should be no difficulty in keeping until spring. It is some trouble to ha-idle fruit so as to keep it through the win ter, but the higher prices ttiat it com mands In the spring will always pay .you for having done the work thor oughly. Poultry keeping In winter can be made very profitable, but there are certain require nents that are essen tial to success, and nnless you can provide these you had be.ter sell out or kill off your fowls, aud not stock up again until spring. The.r sheltei hhould be warm aud dry, with good ventilation. There should be a varie ty of food, for a single item, no mat ter how good In itself, will not serve all the purpose of the fowl. There should be wheat and oats for eggs, corn to keep up the animal heat, chopped roots or green feed to help nut the variety aud assist in digestion There should be dry dust stored away Under cover, to be used as an absorb ent on the floors, aud ground shells to furnish lime from which they can manufacture egg shells. These are not very expensive or burdeusoim things to provide, but Is is the lack of them that makes winter poultry so often unprofitable.

The dairy farmer who means to ex tract the maximum profit from his business should pla-e certain ideals before bim and work steadily toward them. Ooe of these euould be the three hundred pound cow. li tne cows were all up to this average, the dairy would have to be managed very oad indeed in order to fail to pay, aud dairvmeu who have of this class are not often bad managers. Another im should be to keep a cow to each acre. Then the land as well as the cows will pay. This is not impossi ble to attain, for 10 good acree well farmed should produce quite enough iiay, roots, ensilage, etc., to feed 10 good cows. Of course, some grain ould need to be bought, but this vt'ould pay because it would go to making the land continually richer, ,mi an hi tn nroduce more. Ten good cows upon 10 acres of land would make a combination that should afford a comfortable . sustenance to any man, aua upon iuis uoi would be enabled to conduct the dairy business with a degree of satis faction that is never reached by the nan who keept a cow to five acres. Intensive methods may be followed in the dairy a well as anywhere else. A move in the right direction, so far as our agricultural colleges an concerned, is that recently taken in Minnesota, where a practical dairy school is now In operation. Fifteen thousand dollars were appropriated for the purpose of preparlug a suit able building in connection with the University, and tne scnooi wiii w conducted In such a manner as will ive farmers' boys proper instruction in the care of the heard and tbe t of the home dairy, and fo factory men instruction in the beet methods of manufacture. Dairy chools in other countries have beeu proven of the very greatest practical Hjuefit, and in Sweden e?pcially have been the means of increasing the quautity and value of the product enorinouxly. We mention this mat ter particularly because it is a good -ign that our agricultural schools are netting away from the purely theore tical courts ana aowu w imui;i methods of instruction. The theoreli ial, techuifial aud scientific work ia not of less value, only it must be in co-ojertio!i, with practical appli na tion in fuc ways as will serve to bring the farmers in direct contact with the ii.Htructors. A dairy school, or aiiy other school in which the work of the farm is actually per formed, U of incalculable benefit in affoiding a common ground on which thv ran meet. Money expended in this wav i well spent, aud appropria- for such purposes win aiwajs the hearty support of farmers after they have onco seen the work ines of such institution. A cae ii point is the sugar expe iment Btatiou or sugar manufacturers' school of Loniiaua. This is so much appreci ated by the planters of the State that thv make it a noiut to see that it never lacks for funds. If the appro priations for any given period are not sufficient to carry on the work to the fullest extent, any lack is at once made up by private subscription. It is a practical institution, where prac tice and science go hand in band. Height of Cruelty. Nervous women seldom receive the sympathy they deserve. While of ten the pictures of health, they are constantly ailing. To withhold sym pathy from these unfortuuates is the height of cruelty. They have a w ak heart, causing shortness of breath, fluttering pain in side, weak and hun gry spell, and finally swelling of ankles, oppression, choking, smoth ering and dropsy.

The continuous sowing ot rye and then plowing It under consti tute both good cultivation and good fertilizing.- . The secret that lays at the base of all successful farmiug is the knowl edge of how to return the soil eco nomically an equivalent for what the crops take from it- All crops exbau t the soil of '.some fertility. You can draw on the supplies for a time, but after awhiie you can not get enough from it to repay the cost of plauting and harvesting. There are three things that all crops take away, and these must be as continually restored. Tliey are nitrogen, potash and phos phoric acid. Borne of the nitrogen ia restored through the atmosphere, and Home crops, Buch as peas, beans and Mover, draw it from the atmosphere V a considerable extent. Tbe other t lements moat be supplied by meaus of decaying animal or vegetable mat ter, or through the medium of com mercial fertilizers. The farmer who thoroughly learns this lesson and ap plies it is in the right road to success It may for a time seem to be xpen slve work to give the first effort to the enrichment of the land, but when tbe land has once been made rich it will begin to pay, aud you will then Deed no further urging to induce you to keep it so. One of the least variable of farm products, so far as price from year to year is concerned, is standard cream ery butter This may be'seeu by com paring quotations of about the same date. For four years past Jat Elgin, Otjtober 8, 1888, butter sold at 24 cents. October 7, 1889, at 25 cents; October 18f0, at 24 cents; October 5, 1891, at 28W cents. This shows that one may have a tolerably certain basis uion which tA figure, in going into the dairy business, It they manufac ture a good grade of creamery butter. There is perhaps no other product of the farm which has fluctuated bo lit tie In price or upon which we can calculate the price for a year ahead with any degree of certainty. If we could now - eliminate tne uncertain element of cost of production we cou Id have at least one branch of agricul ture upon as firm and business-like a foundation as Is any manufacture in the country. We wish the same uni formity of price could be brought to apply to the product of the private dairy.

Strong men gathered urnunil bim and then passed on. Other strong men and healthy men and tall men came and stood by, gaz iog idly at the prostrate form. Sev eral ladies at a respectable distance asked if the man was drunk. Notone hand was lowered to lift the bleeding head, not a voice asked his name, not an eye expressed sympathy. , The man lay still a moment and then made a motion to rise he did raise to arm's length, almost to a sitting posture. His hands slipped and he fell back to the pavement. Thecrowd surged along the pavement. A young mau with scarcely more than the uiolesceut down of early youth upon his cheeks approached. He walked faster as he neared the bleeding man. He kneeled, spoke a few words and helped the stranger to his feet. He looked abound for assistance. The otronar men had gone with the crowd. He wiped the blood away with his own kercheif aud the two slowly disappeared down the strett, age lean ing upou youth.

They felt that, they held the balance of power, and the key to the situation.

Three more ballots were taken witn out changing a single vote. A motion to take a recess was made, just after the ending of the twenty-sixth, by a Springer man, but it was withdrawn before being put to a v te. A conference between the Springer and McMillin men failed of materializing results, and it became obvious that nothing could be done. A conference . betwen the leaders of the four factions was then held, and a de cision reached that a recess should be taken. Accordingly Mr. Durburrow, a 6upporterof Springer, movea tnat an ninnrnment betaken until 8 o clock and this was agreed to without opposi tion. . . ' ' ''' Much active proselyting was done by the lieutenants of Mills and Crisp during the recess from 6 to 8 o'clock. The Springer men held a conference in a committee room. Mr. Springer was not present. The result of this conference was shown on the twenty-eighth ballot, the first taken after the beginning of the evening session, when four of the Spring er men deserted his ranks.

Be fore the result of the ballot was an nounced, Mr. Springer, who had been waiting in the lobby, entered the caucus and called out to Chairman Hohnan? "I desire to have my. name called. " This was the signal for an outburst of applause, and when the clerk had called Mr. Springer's name and he had respond ed: "I vote for Mr. Charles F. Crisp," the Crisp men broke loose in one wild unrestrained yell. They mounted desks and chairs, and yelled at the top of their voices. Books, handkerchiefs and pieces of paper were thrown into the air, and for a few minutes pandemonium reigned supreme. Crisp men hugged each other in joy and shouted out words Out in the ante-room of the committee on appropriations, where Judge Crisp was sitting surrounded by supporters who were not members, the news was brought with the shouts of the crowd outside the lobby door. Cheer after cheer went up from the crowd, and it was taken up by those inside the Crisp headquarters. Judge Crisp took the news of his election quietly. The with drawal of Mr. Springer caused some change in the vote that was about to be announced. Four of Mr. Springer's sup porters Bryan, of Nebraska; Snow, of Illinois, and Martin and Patton, of In diana allowed their names to stand re corded in favor of Mr. Springer, but Messrs. Busey and Steward, of Illinois, and Holnian, of Indiana, voted for Crisp. The vote was then announced: Crisp, 119; Mills, 103; Springer, 4; Stevens, 1. On motion of Mr. J. D. C. Brown, of Indiana, the nomination of Mr. Crisp was made unanimous. Ex-Congressman Kerr, of Pennsyl vania, was placed in nomination for clerk. There were no other candidates named and he was. nominated by accla mation. The remainder of the ticket agreed upon is as follows: 1 or 8erg?ant-at-arm8 x-vAugro- bill to propose. . . , The silver question in various shapes was pending when the Fifty-first con gress . terminated and there was an in vestigation into the workings of the Mc Kinley tariff act in progress by a com mittee of the senate. Should the result of that investigation be actively brought to the front it might precipitate a tana debate in the senate. There is a dispo sition, however, on the part of leading senators of both parties to leave the initiative tariff matter to the house where it belongs and not to force the fighting in the senate on any issues which will enter into the presidential contest of 18S4?.. Senators believe that a very large in terest of the coming session will be cen tered in the executive sessions. Inter esting information is expected in regard tx rriT relations with Chili. If in the time that has gone by or at the present time our relations witn tnai country v,qi7o Bjvmrned a nhase which might have endangered or which still endangers tVia far will be hud before the senate either by public message or by confidential communication, in either u n Vw rannidered in executive ses- OiOTl.

The correspondence nn this subiect. when the senate last heard of it, had reached a stage whe aat Britain Tirooosed to limit arbitrs tion to the question of what rights Great Britain had conceded to Russia in the Behring sea before the purchase of Alaska bv the United States, and to limit United States authority over Ttahrinsr sea by the decision thus to be orrivAd at. To this the United States re- nlied that such a form of submission nrnTii. nnt. Vm calculated to assure a con elusion satisfactory to either party, and proposed, instead,., six points of arbitra- 3TBs'rHf What exclusive jurisdiction as to seal fishery did Russia exercise before the cession to the unitea owes r i : Second How far did Great Britain acquiesce? .,',.' Third Was Behring sea included in the phrase ''Pacific ocean" used in treaty of 123J , ' ' Fourth Did not all Russia's rights pass to tbe United States? s Fifth What are now the rights of the United States in the seal . fisheries out side the three-mile limit T , Sixth What International regulations are necessary fer a closed season ? , The senate will probably be informed to what extent Great Britain has agreed to submit th e questions to arbitration. This is expected to be done in a special mAsaaire. . Jn the matter of confirming appoint? ments the executive sessions of the sen ate are likely to be important. The names of nine new circuit judges of ap peals, two interstate commerce commis sioners and a secretary of war will prob ably be among the first nominations sent in. Changes in the personnel of the senate will necessitate a complete reorganiza tion of the senate committees. Senators Edmundsj Evarts, Ingalls, Payne, and others who have hitherto borne a large share of the committee work, have left their places to be filled by others. The element of new membership will play a still more important part m the organization of the house. Of the 235 Democratic members entitled to enter into the organization of the house, 105 have never before occupied a seat in congress. : Nearly every state in the union is represented on this list of new members. . , When to these are added twenty-eight new Republican members and eight Farmftrsr Alliance men it will be seen that the speaker will have a herculean task before him in ascertaining as far as possible the preference of 141 new members who know , nothing about fommittee work and making assign ment that will be satisfactory to all of them. It is not in the least likely that the committees can be arranged and the house be organized for legislative busi ness nntil after the Christinas holidays. On whatever basis the house commit tees may be eventually organized it is reasonably certain from official pro nrmncrments already made by all the nartv chiefs, that the five or six com' mittees which share with the committee on appropriation the control of the ex penditures will be organized witn a view to cnttincr down the appropriations tn Mi lowest rjossibla limit.
