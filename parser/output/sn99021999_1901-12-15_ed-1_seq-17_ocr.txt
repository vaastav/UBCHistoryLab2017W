The method of preparing a presidential message Is far-reaching In Us scope. As a Ilrst step the chief executive, some, weeks before he Is ready to begin tho actual work of writing the document, asks each mem ber of his cabinet to prepare a report cov ering the workings of bis branch of tho government and embodying his recom mendations for tho ensuing year, Including an estimate of the amount of money which will bo required for the maliitenniico of tho department under his direction. When a president hns been In olllce for several yenrs lie Is usually so closely In touch with gov ernmental affairs generally that ho needs this data principally as memoranda, but when, ns In tho casu of President Hoosevelt, a man Is unexpectedly called upon to ns sumo tho responsibilities of tho highest olllco In tho land nnd Is required to pre sent n congressional message almost Imme diately tho taBk of familiarizing himself with nil the Interests Involved Is a her culean one. Different presidents have had widely varying methods of preparing their mes sages. Trior to the McKlnley administra tion It vns the custom of each chief execu tive to write his message out in long hand President Cleveland, who Is rather a labori ous worker and some of wIiom' message to congress were somewhat lengthy, foun 1 the preparation of such documents a sore tax upon Ills time. Tin- late President Mc Klnley and President Roosevelt have both had recourse to more modern methods and have dlct-utcd large portions of their mes sages to Secretary 0 II. Cortolyou. In later years, however, there has ben no rule for this. In some Instances Presi dent McKlnley dlctntcd practically an entire message, and then, again. In the case of some of the comparatively brief messages submitted on special occasions, as during tin' Spanish-American war. entire docu ments were written In his own hand. The business of the government has now at tained to such proportions that It Is doubt ful If It will ever again be practicable for a president to i-ot out to pen personally bis entire letter of ailvlce to congress. More over. If the present occupant of the White House has husbanded his time In one direc tion lie has made a more liberal expendi ture of it In another, for. whereas former presidents were wont to Incorporate bodily In their messages the icports prepared by the cabinet olllclals, Mr. Roosevelt insisted on rewriting everything sulunllted for em bodiment In his Initial presidential mes sage and infusing into the recommenda tions his own personal convictions. I.nx. for lelvliilc). l'rnhnhly no man who has stood at the head of the nation was enabled to prepare a congressional message with less apparent effort than the late President McKlnley. lie bad a habit of Jotting down suggestions ami recording lines of thought at odd moments, and thus tho general trend of the dlscus dnn seemed to literally shape Itself. Com ing to his duties as chief magistrate only a few mouths before lie must present an exhaustive declaration of pulley, President Itoosevelt had no opportunity of such leis urely methods in the preparation of hU II I'm t message. Almost from the outset he adopted the plan of seeing no visitors after 1:30 o'clock In the afternoon nnd thus gave up the hours nftor lunch each day almost exclusively to work on the message. Nit Infrequently he devoted u portion of the evening to the same task, anil on tho only occasion during the early weeks of his ad ministration when he visited the theater he departed nfter the Ilrst act in order to get in some work on his message. After a presidential message lias been dictated to the secretaries or penned by baud It Is transcribed In typewritten form, and after revision by the president is sent to the government printing olllce to be put In type. When the "proof" conies from Uncle Sam's big printing establishment It undergoes another revision, and perhaps this may be repeated several times. There has been a grent difference In the tendency of chief executives to make alterations in their messages after the documents were In type. Some presidents have practically re written their mli'flives. to the discomfiture of tile compositors, while others, notably President McKlnley. have, as a rule, made very few corrections. I'llttlllK It III T) lie. Tho manner of handling a presidential message nt tho government printing olllco Is very interesting, for it Is hero that there exists tho greatest danger of dis closure of the contents. Considerable so crecy must bo maintained as to tho Import of this grent letter of advice, for wcro It possible for stock manipulators and specil lators of various kinds to learn in ad anre the character of some of the meas ures advocated the llnanelal and business stability of the country might be mo meutarily shaken as a result of the tin scrupulous efforts of such schemers to en i ich themselves. Once, during the llaca administration, a presidential message was stolen mid the theft Is reported to haw netted the perpetrators many thousand del lars, but there has never been a repetition of the loss. The message from the time it Is delivered at the printing olllce until li emerges In pamphlet form, ready for de llery at the White House. Is solely In charge of one olllclal, who Is held lespousi ble for Its safe keeping. Presidential mes sages range In length from IU.immi to L'O.ooo words and in prcpnilng such u document for the typesetters it Is cut up into pieces so small thai no compositor can gain an dellulte Knowledge of tlie subject under ills cusslon. The woik Is also so distributed among hundreds of typesetters that It is Imprint li able fur any group of men io "compute notes-' with a view to ascertain ing the Import of any particular part of tin- document. Kei'iihiK li liiiil.. The asM'iiibllng of all these various musses of type is entrusted to a man of known responsibility and the same care is exercised with legnrd to the eiuplojcs who print Hie documents and bind them. Mm li the same system Is followed that prevails in the llureau of Printing and Kngruviiig. where currency Is printed. Knch sheet of paper which is Issued for use In printing li presidential message must be accounted for ere tho woikman to whom It has been entrusted Is allowed to leave the building lit night. The printed copies of the message are dc llvered at the White House and from there distributed to the various newspaper olllrcs throughout tlie country, a courtesy ex tended III onlir that the newspapeis ma not lie put to the Inconvenience of hur liedly placing In type this enormous docu iiient In the few bonis Intervening between its presentation to eniigiess and the hour at which a majority of the dally papers go to press. Kach newspaper agrees, of course, not to divulge any of Hie contents of the message in advance. In some instancin the "advance copies" of I lie mestage have been Issued to the newspapers six days in advance of the dale of delivery, thus allow, ing time for tlie document to be trans mitted by mail to publication on the I'a cille coast, but on the other oi'i'iisiiius, ow ing to tardiness In the completion of the document, less than forty-eight hours has Intervened. It has been necessary at such times for the press associations to tele graph the full text of tlie message to nil the prominent daily papers in the mine remote sections of the country. This has entailed an expense of thousands of dollars for tele graph tolls alone. iei'liil Co for Couuri'MN, Kncli member of congress, when be takes his seat to listen to the reading of the presidential message on the morning of a M'sslou of the national legislature llnds lie. fore him a printed copy of the document similar to that furnished to tin' newspapers Yet this Is not the form in which It readies the presiding olllcers of Hie two houses of congress.

Not ns many stories of John I). Rockefel ler are told as of men who go about more in public. Hut now and then we got ono Here Is the most recent, lelated by the llrooklyn Kagle: Years ago Mr. Rockefeller was n poor clerk In Cleveland, drawing a salary of $10 a month. He bad nu ailment which required a simple ami harmless sur gical operation. Ho went to a surgeon of high reptlto In Cleveland mid arranged to pay so much a month. The surgeon was willing mid It took Rockefeller nbout a yeor to pay tho hill of $in without In terest. No so very long ngn Mr. Rockefeller sent for tho sntno surgeon, now nn old man, ami eiitortnlned him at his Tarry Forest homo. Tho mognato wanted another consultation regarding tho old complnlnt and ohoso to send for the surgeon of his youth. They talked It ovor nnd then Rockefeller asked for tho hill, romnrklng' "I won't keep you walling ns I did years ago. Things liavo changed since then." "Oh, I am out of practice; I wish no fee, Mr. Rockefeller. That Is nil right. Don't mention It." Rockefeller opened a drawer at his desk, disclosing a few pounds of new green backs. Putting a few bills In an envelope ho handed it to tho surgeon, saying: "Well, If you do not want to take a fee, give this to some poor young doctor of your ac quaintance." Theio was $r.00 In Hie en velope, nnd afior in rival homo tlie old sur geon did not think of any young doctor to whom ho could give the money mid kept It. A Herman friend having Invited Cn.l Scimrz to spend tho remainder of his life In Southern California, Mr. Schurz replied gratefully, hut says the literary projects lie has on hand preclude the Idea of his giving himself up to the enjoyment of na ture. Mr. Schurz. by the way, was among N( guests at a dinner given to the stalf or the New Yolk I. veiling Post on its 100th anniversary. In his speech he paid the pa per the high compliment of saying: "It Is not even afraid of Its friends." - - Tho relations between Isldoie Itayuer, at torney general of Maryland, and Admiral Schley beautifully Illustrate tho line old southern spirit of chlvnlry. We call It southern, relntes the llrooklyn Kngle, be cause tho graces of friendship seem to blos som moro freely In the warmer dlmo than In New Kngland When the court of In quiry was ordered Admiral Si hley engaged two life-long friends ns his counsel. One was the late Judge .leieiiilah Wilson ami Hie other was Mr. Itayuer. In asking Mr Itayuer to serve ho wiote; "I wish a rep lesciitatlvo from my own statu to represent mo In this coiitioversy. 1 have selecicd mi nnd it is hardly necessary for mo in add that I shall be delighted with youi prcsi nee and grateful for your distinguished services." Mr. Itayuer at once honored the draft in. uli' on ills friindshlp mid for Hie honor of his slate and Its distinguished I epl'i'Hi utal ive ill the navy he strove to pinvo that tlie admiral had done his ilulv as a sunt liein gentleman. And when the Inquiry was ended he declined to accepl ono dollnr of pay. He even met Ills own ex peases while In Washington, hut the ml-' mlral would not let Hie matter rest here Ho has given to Mrs. Itayuer a beautiful brooch, studded with diamonds, and In Mr Itayner a gold watch and chain with a gold pencil as a charm. During the long weeki of the sessions of Hie coin I of Inquiry Ad mlral Schley had sat i lose to Ills counsel Mr. Itayner bad mi old-fashioucil, key-wind Ing timepiece, which had long since out lived Its usefulness It did not keep good time and Itayner was in Hie hahit of turn ing to Admiral Schley frequently nnd ask ing the time of day. I.lko many other law yers, Mr. Itayner was often without a pen ell mid he would ask the admiral to loan him Ids pencil. Ilccauso he noted tlieso things tho admiral thought the pencil and tho wnteh would bo appreciated by his friend. Doubtless It was his remembrance of Mr. Rayner's splendid service Hint among other things made him sny that he was thankful for everything, "not one par ticular thing, but everything"
