Yes, but it will be from the frying pan into the fire in the case of all you lellows who make light, of so heavy a thing an your, wives' cooking. L All men and all women living in a Christian country and in the midst ot our civilization should marry. The family is the foundation of our civilization, and the Christian religion gives us the purity and the sweetness of the fireside Abbeville Prese and Banner. All of which is eminently true, but the inquiry naturally arises, why is it that Editor Wilson, of t he Press and Banner, .who is himself a confirmed old bachelor, has never practiced what ho so well preaches?

As published in Wednesday's News, and again in today's pa per, in the list of Conference appointments, Lancaster loses both of ner popular Methodis' ministers, Mr. Turnipseed, of the First Methodist church, be# -a a - 11^ lfiK fcransierreu 10 ocuiieuMvnn f and Mr. Carter, of Grace churcl, to Vanwyck.

Bishop Morrison certaiuly ( 'shook up" the South Carolina , Conference from center to cir- i sumference by bis appointments, , )ut it is hoped that everything , vill work out all right in the rnd. By the wholesale and sur)ri?ing changes made deep dis ippointment has been caused in nany communities, but time done will prove the wisdom or oily of the bishop's apparently evolutionary action. In no event lowever, will tie loyalty of the dethodisls and tbeir abiding aith in the wisdom of the it meruit system be shaken. Of the 235 ninislers in the Conference, as many as 150, it is stated, were moved." ADVICE TO PREACHERS. Bishop Morrison m iy be an extremist, a in n of radical action, trom some points of view, but his head is leyel when it comes o defining the duties anil re sponsibilities of a minister. In the main, he has a proper concep'ion ol what ? preacher's course and attitude should be, especially toward bis congregation. In his address at GafFney to the class of young ministers Bishop Mor risou is quoted as saying: In preaching you should first know what the people need. G<? to the Bible and get an inspired basis for your sermon. Don't preach what other men have preached. Make your own sermons. Throw the 500 outlines away. Keep in touch with the spirit and God will give yon thoughts and ideas. If your sermons are yours the people will bear you. Take care of your voice. The people will listen to pla'i'udes even if they can hear them clearJy When you go to your charge take charge Take charge of the whole Church, the Sunday-school, league, choir, everything. I abominate a choir that takes charge ot the preacher. Don't let your administration be sell assertive, but wise. Manage your Church as a wise wile manages her husband ?without letting the Church know it. Take charge of yourself. Ke<>p sweet and gentle. Remember that what are sometimes called Methodist peculiarities are oftentimes ou> strengt h. Don't go into the ministry to he an ecclesiastical politician.

President's Message to Congress this Week in a NutShell. Atlanta Journal, of Wednesday. The annual message of Pre?iTheodore Roosevelt, read today before the joint session of both liouues of the Sixtieth United States congress, contains thirty thousand words. The president recommends federal licenses or national charters for corporations. He recommends that any revision of the tariff be postponed at least until atter the election. He proposes that the congress appropriate money nocessaiy to defray the expenses ot the leading national parties in presidential elections. Of most vital importance from the viewpoint of the President is the recent financial depression or stringency, pointing to the moral lesson of purgation of dishonest business metnoas. Tlie anther of the message urges piompt action as to a definite currency plan, though the minutia of the proposition receives no tangible suggestion from the president Relative to the currency plan, however, the president suggest* that it must be of sufficient elasticity to enable its speedy retirement after the financial stringency be passed. The president follows his previous declarations as to railroads and corporations, advocating all the publicity possible in regard to the inside workings of giant corporations throughout the country. He empha'ically urged federal incorporation or conditional !i censes, which, together with si ! wholesome governmental >-uperv! jsion, he believes would prevent t a great deal of dishonesty which h ?s been prevalent in the past in the various channels ol business and trade. The present tariff system, th* president says, is responsible foi the excellent balance which pre vails between our expenditure! and income, pointing with nridf to the yearly average of $31,000, 000. lie is of the opinion that tin tariff system should be giveL careful scrutiny to prevent an} tendency to growing abuses ii the administration of this im portant feature of the govern ment. The president is heartily 11 i favor of an income tax, thong] i tie saj s he speaks with iovoreuc 'due to the contrary decision o * the United States supreme com , on the subject. i It is the opinion ot the presi dent that recent prosecution ' have successfully denied the ol reasons given that it had bee inioossible to imuieh dishonest > where the multy were men * i great wealth. In discussing railroad arc dents the president declares th? , more peopl? are being killed > . the great, steam highways of th country than are claimed in til wars of the world. He urges tin the federal government invest gate railroad accidents. j The lessons learned from hj f recent journey down the Missif . sippi river are pointed to as In S"ftftAn nnniurlt fnr tha f*All t Hlg .v,. ? try to pay partioular',attention>to a the development of its interior c waterways. t Employers* liability, western n land frauds, savings bank system I and many other matters ot espe s eial interest, to the public welfare are dealt with at consider ^ able length in the message.
