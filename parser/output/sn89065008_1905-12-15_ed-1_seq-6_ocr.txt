Which means his end as cotton riser.' The handsome new postoffice, now being erected for the Department by Mr. F. R. Austin, will be an orna ment to Market street when complet ed. The upstairs of the new build ing contains several desirable office rooms. Splendid progress is being made with the work of laying the granoli thic sidewalks and street crossings in Greenwood, and when the present contracts have been finished the city will have one of the best systems of sidewalks of any place in Mississippi. of The planters of Lefloro county are going to do their full duty toward maintaining the organization of the Southern Cotton Growers Associa tion by paying the three cents per bate assessment. A good many have already done so and the others can be depended upon to assist the or ganization. Greenwood merchants have the most attractive and up-to-date stocks of holiday goods to be found any where. No one has any excuse to order their Christmas and New Year gifts from other cities, as our dealers are prepared to satisfy the most fastidious in these lines.

It is the query is no simple truth, as shown by the fami ly light now going on between Gov. Vardaman and the other four mem hers of the penitentiary board. Of couse it has required money and management to bring about this And, of course, remarkable profit, a certain amount must bo deducted as representing the difference in the cost of labor to the private individ ual, but even allowing a liberal sum as wages, the certainty and magni tude of the profits ought to move appealingly attractive to both the farmers of the North and the capi ident be talist of the East. It is an ill wind that blows no good. Gov. Vardaman and his ad herents may get hailstones because of his family tempest, and his asso ciates on the board, but antagonists in the matter, may receive sleet in the face, but the disturbance in Mississippi's household has opened a door for curious-minded neighbors to spy out, not the poverty, but the wealth she has stored away, noise of a quarrel, too, is heard I much further than friendly good ad vice, and we doubt not that tho pretty bit of evidence demonstrat ing the value of judicious cotton cultivation has reached ears in many a distant spot. Nor does testimony of this kind go in at one ear and come out at anoth er. Money-making, and the places where and the methods constitute the magnet to popular desirt draws the people from afar, and thus this picturesque family squall in Mississippi is more than apt to prove a splendid immigration ad vertisement, not only to that State, but to the \yhole cotton region.— Commercial-Appeal. The Q. city til in in by city of It HUMPHREYS RE APPOINTED. Congressman B. G. Humphreys of this District was re-appointed a member of the Rivers and Harbors Committee by Speaker Cannon, which is cause for much gratification on the part of his constituents. Mr. Humphreys had a hard fight to re tain his position on this important committee, and we are glad he got the place again. It would have been a great misfortune to the Delta for him to gave been left oil of this committee. are the per have can or The Commonwealth Souvenir Hol iday Edition is not wlmt we expect ed to make it, but we have done our best under t he existing circumstan ces. Limited help in the office pre vented the printing of a larger num ber of jiages, as more advertisements could have liet'n secured if we had had time to solicit them. However, we believe it will bo conceded that the edition is one of the neatest, and most artistically designed ever print ed in Greenwood or the State. the any to Year most our lie is have the to to sin lib "The national government already does something in connection with the construction and maintenance of the great system of levees along the lower course of the Mississippi; in my judgment it should do much more,"—From President Roosevelt's Message. 

TURNS HIS WORDS ON HIM These words of Editor Vardaman in criticism of Governor McLaurin are now turned on Gov. Vardaman by Mr Percy as follows: "If the criticism of Gov. McLaurin deserved, and the taxpayers of „.Ithis county considered it was, it is ,jj|)j cu it to see in what particular the induct of Gov. Vardaman is less Insurable. Each served his friend, and did so without the ascertainment of, or regard for, the wishes of the i taxpayers of the district." Mr. Percy also refers to the peti-j tion for Dr. Atterbury rejected by, Gov. Vardaman in favor of Senator Hebron, from which the following extract is taken: "If there is any doubt in the mind j of your excellency as to Dr. Atter- j bury being the choice of the taxpay- j ers of Washington county for this position, we earnestly petition that you submit the matter to a Demo cratic primary of the county, to be held at such time as you may indi cate, or as the executive committee of the county may designate. "We address this petition to you with confidence, because we under stood that it was one of the cardinal principles of the platform upon which vou were elected Chief Magistrate of the State, that levee board appoint ments should be made with an eye single to the fitness of the ap pointees and the welfare of the dis trict." Altogether, Mr. Percy's criticism of the Governor, he having been one of his leading and most effective sup porters, is decidedly the most im portant contribution to the political literature of the State for some time.
