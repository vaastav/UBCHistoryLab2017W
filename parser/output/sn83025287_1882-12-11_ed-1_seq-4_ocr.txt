Poor Cole- Pliny asserted that the Iliad of Homer had been written on a piece of parchment so smell ae-to be enclosed in a nutshell. Hidt. altboagh skeptical as to the fact stated, made as experiment which con vinced him that it was possible. The poem contains £50)00 verses, it is .possible to write thirty verses of the Iliad in a single line and 250 lines in a single page. A piece of vellum ten inches long and eight inches wide can be put in the nutshell of a large walnut, and Hult considers it possi ble to write the entire Iliad on the two sides. The United States commissioner of rail roads says there is no doubt but congress has the power to control commerce on the railroads. In this he is greatly mistaken. There are very grave doubts of the power of congress in this regard, else the experi ment would have • been tried long ago. The fact that such as attempt would be manifestly unconstitutional.and would have been so held by the courts, is all that has deterred the Republicans from assuming this and many other powers that belong ex clusively to the states. That is a very pretty trap the Repubii cans have setfortheDemocrals in congress, which is detailed in-our Washington special (his morning, and thwre is every probability that it will be successful. The I Democrats cannot afford to defeat any of the important appropriation bills for the sake of defeating the riders placed upon them, though there is excellent Republican ; authority for doing so to be found in the ' veto message of Mr. Hayes during the brief term in which they had a majority; in both houses. Great watchfulness will be \ required on the part of the Democrats to avoid falling into the snares and pitfalls that will be prepared for their feet by their wily and desperate opponents. HO J] V IT WORKS. The millers and their organs are de nouncing and ridiculing the Farmers' Board of Trade. This is done with a view of preventing the farmers from unit ing and securing such protection as combination, and legislation can give them. The millers point to the prices they pay and argue that they are the farmers' best friend. Prices amount to very little in comparison with the grade. Of course the millers pay mar ket j) rices, but they make the grade and by their facilities iv shipping might be said to make tho market also, though they nominally follow Liverpool. Here is a sample of the grading recorded by the Pope county Press: A great deal of fault is found by the farmers over the grading of wheat along the L. F. & D It. K. in this county. Boms of the fanners claim they can da better along the lino of the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba and- some claim they cannot, so it is bated to tell exactly where the trouble lies. It seems to be im possible for all "graders to grade alike. Some wheat that is grad?d down low at Alexandria is graded higher hec.i, and vice versa. There aro some very peculiar facts about this grading of j wheat business, that are very puzzling to | some. Michael ilelland, of Bareness, took a load i of wheat to Yillard and it was graded So. 2. His brother, Edward Holland, then took a load of the same wheat to Yillard, and the same buyer, graded it No. 1. . So it lias been every time. ; With the same wheat Michael Holland can only get grade No. 2, but his brother Edward gets No. 1, and the latter is doing all the hauling of wheat to market at present. Torgiis Johnson, of Bars nose, brought a lot of Ids wheat to the Glen wood grain house, without cleaning it, and it was graded So. 1. Thinking they would dock it less, ho cleaned the next load, and brought it in and it was graded No: 2. Ha sells the balance without cleaning it. it is quite natural for the farmers to be restive when they see the elevators owned almost entirely by the millers, and the grading, the price and all handled by an organization which has no competition. It sounds very nice to say, 'Let the farmer fell his own wheat. If our way of doing business does not suit him. he can sell or ship it himself." They know all the avenues are closed to the small farmer. The man with his | -housznd acres or more, may be tolerably ' independent by finding b'js own market, but the average farmer must market his grain from Iris wagon at some point ad ace'at to his home and the millers' ring have "him completely at their mercy. He rv.ust accept their terms or starve. At present he is compelled to accept and the millers' rin£_ fears that the Far j mers' Board of Trp.de may form a nucleus which will chasure the programme. When the millers seized the elevator system of Northern. Minnesota they overdid the matter. They have good reason for fear ing that their monopoly cannot last. mi 

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. ! The rcvflrence which wa3 once felt foe the presidential office, and the respect for 1 its incumbents, are felt no more. The dignity and decency which once character ised high officials seem to have passed away. Respect for the office has keen weakened by its hater incumbents. The fussy, passionate manifestations of \ Johnson; fee low personal favoritism and corruption of Grant; tho ' weak, pointless complacency of Hayes.; •tho low political canning and boa etnas! 5 ■ habits of Arthur, all have served to undig * nify theoincs m the'eyes of the people, i.nd to lake f rem it that reverential respect ! •and veneration which was accorded to it j in its inception and retained in the earlier j stages of upright administration. The delivery of the president's message was once a great went. It was sought for | with in ten.- eagerness, and the wildest and most energetic exertions were put forth for its early transmission. It is worthy of j note that this year the message of the J president caused no sensation in antici pation of its delivery, and no eager scram ble for its possession after its delivery. I* was received as a common matter-of-fact affair. A demi-god like Washington, or a states man like Jefferson, or a hero like Jackson. was not on deck, but simply "Cher" Arthur, the small j fry accidental incumbent of a groat office. His homily, setting forth the affairs of the nation, as by the constitution required, was received with indifference and neglect ful unconcern. Neither the people nor con gress look to executive falminations for statesmanlike qualities or prescience, or patriotic, unselfish, wise and competent advice or recommendations, unmixed with partisan elements. The executive office is great and power ful, but the littleness, incompetency and unworthiness of the later incumbents, have caused for it a decadence of that rev erence and respect which was «nee properly felt for it. No wonder that large masses of the people by the wretched experience of the reverse, ardently desire to see once more a statesman of en larged views and capabilities, and patriotic national impulses in the presidential chair, instead of a mere, narrow-minded poli , tician, the head of a ring, the shameless disposer of the spoils of office to partisan favorites and henchmen. In this regard it is to be hoped that 1884 will open a new era 'to the American people and that they may not only have respect for the executive office, but an incumbent of it worthy, also, of respect and confidence, for his manly character, his patriotic views, and his hon est purpose to administer the government for the welfare of the whole people, and not merely in the interest of a party.

I Paul and Osnaba Companies—No Proba- i bility wf s*-n Agreement. Special Tologrwri to the Globe. J New Yoee, Dec. IC.When the confer -1 ence of the preside* and other offi-jers of 1 the warring railroads in the Northwest was over, President Keep, of the Northwestern road, who had presided, said nothing defi nite had been accomplished. According to the accounts of those who were present, nothing more was done than to review the •same ground tkat was gone over Friday. The Chippewa Valley road, whose transfer to the Si. Paul brought the negotiations in Novercber for peace to a sudden termina tion, came up again. President Porter, who had insisted that this was a clear in vasion of his territory, suggested that ; | the road should be put in ; | such a position that .;.' it could . j not be used to the injury of I either the Omaha or the St. Paul system. ! He contended that it was a dangerous ele i ment on account ©f the trouble that it [ I might be made to create. President Por i i tor thought that the way to avoid the per- I j nicious influence of the Chippewa Valley , ! was by operating it in the joint interest of . ! both. He left it to be determined how the . obstacle should be disposed of, but he said j it must be. removed. I*he St. Paul repre [ sentatives, it was learned, d-d not propose to surrender control of tho road, . although it' the Omaha wanted to send busi ness over it would make a traffic arrange . ment with it. The question of territorial rights could not be dislodged from the position in which it had been placed. President Porter took his old ground throughout regarding it, bat the St. Paul was not inclined to yield him the right to build alone in the country that he main tained belonged natnraly to his system. The way the Omaha's territory was map ped out in the conference was by taking the Wisconsin Central railroad, which runs down through the center of Wiscon sin as the dividing line. President Porter was willing to concede the St. Paul that part of the state east of the Wisconsin Central, but he claimed, for the protec tion of his own system, that part west of it. The Mississippi and St. QCroix rivers marked the western limit of what was looked upon as the Omaha's exclusive territory. There were no concessions on either side, and when the conference adjourned no progress had been made. The appointment of a committee com posed of the,managers of the road, except President Porter, created the impression that an etjort would be made to prepare a plan for settlement on a tariff basis, leav ing out the territorial question altogether: or making it a subject of arbitration. Later in the afternoon it was understood that the St. Paul contemplated extending the eastern arm of the Chippewa Valley up from Eau Clare through the very heart of the territory claimed by tho Omaha- No pledge could be secured from the St. Paul representatives not io make the extension, and the Chippewa Valley proved the principal subject of dis cussion. President Porter was as resolute when the meetings were over as before, and reported that territorial rights could alone be the basis of settlement. Vice President Hnghitt said to-night that there were no new phases in the mat ter and that the general situation was un changed. There were a good many speculators at the Windsor last night, and nearly every one had a different story about the war. One had it that a settlement had been reached, anil another that the break was as wide as ever. On account of the con flicting reports t.'io difficulty came to be known as the Northwestern conundrum. The question of territorial rights is comparatively a new one, and it formed a general subject of discussion to day in its application to the railroad iv which it has keen uaado a prominent fea ture. r. Alexander Mitchell, president of the St. Paul, said what had been termed territorial rights might be innocent or harmful. It was true that a road had no right to build where there was no business for it, but he denied the privilege of one line to say that another shall restrict itself to any particu lar limits. Julius Wadsworth, vice president of the St. Paul, said that Mr. Porter's demand for an establishment of territorial rights would be disregarded in a settlement. The St. Paul wou'd not put itself on record as binding itself not to build above Eau Claire. The settlement must be made in another way. While the Chippewa Valley line could not be given up, the St. Paul would be glad to do business for the Omaha under a traffic agreement. It was always ready to take all the business that came to it, and the more the better. Mr. T. Milibank, a director of the St. Paul, took the same ground as President Mitchell and Vice-President Wads worth. He said it was idle to suppose that territo rial rights, as they were denominatod,would be embodied in any settlement that might take place. ?. . Hugh Riddle, president of the Rock Is land road, belie red that the country on either side of the line for , a reasonable distance belonged morally to that road. If it performed its duties, the road which invaded its line would be encroaching on its rights. A town might have one line and urge projectors to build another one to the same place, in hopes they would se cure the benefit of cheap rates by 1 i eason of competition. For 200 miles east from Council Bluffs the Rock Island was paral leled by the St. Paul, and the two roads ran close together much of the way. There was no need of the Si. Paul building where it did. The Rock Island was certainly able to do the business. The invasion in this instance was clear through. . H. H. Porter, president of the Otn'-pih road, as he said before, that to build •'. ■:■■ the railroad . facilities were already duni cient, was ruinous and reckless. There would not be profit enough for both, and everyone knew that one good railroad was far better than two poor ones. Mr. Porter declared that a railroad should not take a portion of the country to itself without supplying adequate facilities. He pointed out on a map why he believed . that ' portion of Wis consin west of the Wisconsin railroad ought to be considered the territory of his road, and ought not to have been invaded by the St. Paul. Mr. Porter said if he could see anything unreasonable in his de mand-; he would not T»ress them. The necessity of pooling <fiG business to keep the peace was a thing to avoid. If there were no competing lines, pools to keep up the rates and -present war would not be necessary, and peace would be perpetual. His company was ready at all '„ times to build roads wherever needed in the terri- I tory indicated. 

SHE'S SICE, SOT NAUGHTY. The Latest Phase of the Langtry A«lvertls l*aarSe<«aHla| —Her Manager Declares Her Conduct lias Been Severely Proper—lter Alleged Liaison in England a Fiction of the Imagination. [Special Telegram to the Globe. | Boston, Dec. 10. —Mrs. Langtry has been so overworked with rehearsals and constant performances that she is suffering greatly from nervous prostration, and at the close of the second act of "An Unequal Match" I yesterday afternoon the indulgence of the j audience was claimed for ten minutes. At the end of that time the curtain was raised and the performance was finished as usual. Last night her nervous system was so over wrought that she had to decline all invita tions and visitors, and although she went through her part of Rosalind in "As You Like It," it was evident she was suffering greatly. She was to have gone to the Papyrus club reception to meet the literary men and women of the city, and a number of specially invited guests, including Gov. Long and his moth er, but this she was compelled to forego. In regard to the interview with Mrs. La- J bonchere in Washington, Mr. Charles A. Mendnm, the acting manager of tho com pany, was seen to-night, in the absence of Mr. Abbe; and Mr. Schoeffel in New York, and denied in the most unqualified terms the truth of the assertions .Mrs. Labou chere is alleged to have made. Mrs. Lang try could not be seen, but Mr. Mendnm, speaking by her authority, states that tie relations between the two women were las: Sunday perfectly amicable, aud that, so Ear as Mrs. Langtry knows they still continue. They will join tho company again in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the ] 19th inst., when a third party will be pies- \ ent in the person of Mrs. Langtry'a sifter, ; who will arrive here from England on j Tuesday next, and will travel with tho company during the American tour. The ; story of a liaison with Baron Chetwynd is contemptuously ridiculed by Mr. Mendum, who points to the fact that Mrs. Langtry moved in the best society tn England, and was an especial favorite with the princess of Wales and other pure women, who would never have countenanced her had there been the slightest suspicion of her. In fact she was as Caesar's wife should have been, but was not wholly above suspicion. Had there been anything of the kind it must have be come known/and Mr. "Abbey would never nave speculated in the success of a good ameteur actress who was weighted with a bad record. Her -relations with her husband and ! family have always been of tho most happy character, and this alone tends to disprove tho statement. It is admitted that she has not acted here with as much caution as the average American woman would do, but from her standpoint as an English actress she has not tres passed the bounds of pro priety. In London it is considered the correct thing for an actress to receive attentions from admirers of their ability or beauty, and while following that custom here she baa in no manner overstepped the line drawn by all virtuous women. Mr. Gibhardt lias followed her, has shown his I admiration for her in the most open man ner, has put up at the same hotel, which, of course, be had a right to do. end last night he returned to New York. Further than an openly expressed homage, ho has not gone. The theater people claim that her financial success here has been very great, and that the- present week's receipts will reach

A Little Child Suffering from Smalt-Pox Driven from Home by I's Heartless Mother. A brutal case of abandonment and cruel ty was brought to light on the Bth inst. by the discovery of a child, suffering with small-pox and nearly frozen, lying in an ' open yard of a hoiis;} in Soath Baltimore. ' The case was discovered early in the morn ing by the inmates of yard No. 2d- Ham burg street, in whose house the child, Su san Green, aged nine year', was found. It was at once reported to the health of fice, and Inspector Brown was dispatched to the scene. Upon entering the yard lie en- ■ countered a pitiable spectacle. Lying prone upon its back was the little sufferer, nearly miked, its only covering being a few filthy rags. The ground was frozen bard, while under and around the child there were several pools of wa!er« which were covered with ice. The child ws bo numbed by the intense cold and unable to utter a word when placed in the ambu lance and removed to the quarantine hos pital. Upon inquiry it was learned that the mother of the child, who lives in the neighborhood, upon discovering last night that the child bad the small-pox at once sent her out in the cold to find a shelter wherever she could, and it is thought* the child wandered about until be numbed by the cold. She entered the yard to seek refuge, and, fearing to ask admis sion to the house, fminted from exposure. Tho mother, upon being told of the case, remarked that she had "no time to fool with her"; that she had a "place out at- ser vice which paid her better than looking after a child with small-poi." The case has caused Home excitement in the neigh borhood, It is one that comes under the law recently passed prohibiting the remov al without authority of the health board of any persons Buffering with the small-pox. The health commissioner wib prosecute the mother to the full extent of the law. The Redskin as a Voter A peculiarly interesting and novel elec tion trie* comes from Pierre, Dakota, in which roast dog formed the principal part and secured the election of C. W. Comfort as sheriff. On the Pierre bottoms were th rty-six buck Indians who were engaged 'in farming, and who had been instructed by a missionary how to vote. If they voted at all they would vote for Mr. Corn stock's opponent, and a scheme to keep them away from the polis had worried Mr. Comfort for some time. He finally hit upon a plan, and purchased about fifty dogs,' $150 worth of provisions, etc., and accompanied by an interpreter, went to the camp and announced a grand feast to take place the night before election and at some distance from \ their place. .The roast dog touched a .tender chord in the savage breast", and the thirty six Indians went in a body to the scene of the feast. Dancing and feasting was com menced .ad lasted all night, and Comfort gave orders to buy more dog if necessary. In the morning they expressed a wish to go and vote, but the interpreter informed them that any time within four days would do. This satisfied them. Meakwbile the missionary waited for their coming to the polls, but they came not and the polls were closed. Comfort was elected by twenty-seven majority, but had it not been j for the roast dog ho would have been de- ! feated by nine votes. Steamship .News.

In com parison with the importance of this subject he declares that the disputes on questions of civil-service reform, internal revenue, and the tariff laws will sink into insignifiance. At present Mr. Ker can see no vital ques tion dividing the Republican hud Demo cratic parties, and it is this absence of a bone of contention that will hasten a dis pute. But the leading cause to bring about this result is the increasing commer cial interest taken by Americans, in Mexican affairs. The investment of American capital in Mexican railroads has already awakened an interest among business men in the affairs of that country, and Mr. Ker expects to see leading com i mercial men from the Northern states en gage in active trade with the people across the border. The resources of Mexico have only recently become known to the people lof this country. Mr. Ker believes oar I financial interest in that country will ulti mately lead to a demand for its annexa tion. I*. is not on business interests alone that j the lawyer depends for the folKllmant of ! his prophecy. Ha declares that the history j of the republic, clearly shows a course of ■ aggrandizement that can no* be checked j until the American flag floats over every j square mile of territory in North America. [This national idea, Mr. Ker, declares, ass ! been the guiding star of every j administration ' since Washington was president, and, as illustrations of this he j cites tho acquisition of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California and Alaska from the Spanish, French, Mexican, and Russian ; governments. Again, Mr. Ker depends ■ upon the spirit of discontent which a quar j ter century of peace will breed among the I masses to work a sentiment in favor of Iwar. Population is now increasing so • fast, and there i.-. such a difficulty in riud | in;.r employment for all, that a war will be needed to kill off the surplus population. That ex-senator Blame favors this ! scheme is declared to be an open secret among Washington politicians. Theex sejfetary's intervention iv the (Chili-Peru controversy is cited as a proof of his earnestness in the ques tion. Th's is declared to have been the hist step in a plan for embroiling the gov ernment in hostilities with the two South American republics in order to make American influence paramount on the 1 southern continent. Once the government became engaged in war with a South American power, or should the commercial supremacy of America become established among the South American governments, the people of this country would recognize the importance of possessing Mexico and demand the annexation of that country. The completion of a ship canal across the isthmus of Panama will make it im perative to the integrity of the American government that the United States should control all the country between the present frontier and the canal. When that day is * reached there will be prospects of a thriving Ameri can trade in that part of South America dying along the Pacific coast, and follow ing this the American dag will be as much respected on the summits of the Andes, in the valley of the Amazon, and at the Horn as it is in sight of the capitol dome. - : Mr. Ker expects to see American influ ence made paramount, not only in the southerly direction, but in the north also, as Canada will be obliged in course of time to seek annexation for protection! It j is impossible, he says, for a weak and iso lated people, like the Canadians will be after separation from England, to thrive beside & powerful nation like the United Stales, and its absorption as an integral part of the government is, therefore, im perative. Then will America and the United States become coextensive. TO 'IHH 

DEATH. Pat *ihen, fie. Pawnee Terror, Killed in a. Duel Hi k Gordon Ellis in Nevada. [Paw. ci Hepub can. \ Many i f our readers will recollect Pat She the Loss of Dick Shannon's men, who worked on a railroad three or four miles west of iown at the time it was built. Some of our townspeople will also recol lect what r. "howiy terror" Pat was when he came to the city and steamed up on whisky, and of the numerous knock downs and brawls he then engaged in. He was a big. stout, powerful man, and nearly fivcry one hereabouts stood in awe or took to their legs when the burly Irishman came upon a scene where a "knocking down and dragging out,"formed the chief features of the play. One evening, while returning home from this city, he met a man driving a team near Mr. Osborn's, and fancied that the man had done him an injury in some way or other, so lie concluded to settle the matter then and there by mopping the ground with the teamster. But the mop proved to be on the other end of the stick, for the team ster stopped his horses, got out of the wagon, braced up to Pat, knocked him down, and hammered him until he cried enough. This was the only time Pat ever met his master in Pawnee. It seems now, however, that he has met his equal again, as well as his executioner, at Bennett's ranch, Nevada, where he and a man named Ellis became involved in a quarrel at gambling. Ellis told Shea he would boot him if he did . not mend his ways. Shea dared him to shoot an un armed man as he was, and Ellis blazed away, sending a ball through Pat's leg be low the knee. More words followed, and Ellis perforated Pat's other leg. While this was going on, some men started to camp, a short distance away, for their rifles. Ellis, meantime,- got on his horse ready to go, bat the crowd forced him to remain. Shea managed to get hold of one of the rifles when the men returned, and Ellis.seeing him do so, slid off his horse on the side furthest from Shea. The latter then cried out to Ellis: ''Now, if you want to shoot at my logs any more, step out from behind that horse and blaze away." Ellis held his position behind the h-Slxe. Shea told him he did not want to shoot the horse,but that if he did not como out at once, and ''come a-shootin'," he would shot the horse. Ellis saw there was no help for it, and, dodging under the horse's head, came "a-shootin'" : sure enough, his first shot striking Shea in the groin and ranging upward. : Shea, how over, shot in the groin and both le^s, ', re mained standing long enough to fire two shots at Ellis, twe first with trifling effect, but the second knocking him in death throes,to the ground, Shea falling at the same instant. Recovering, Shea rose to a sitting postuie and called to the men, who in the meantime had rushed in, to "stand out of : the way till 1 give him ax-other shot." The dying man hearing the re mark, whispered:. "Don't let him shoot; I've got enough." She was assured that there was no need of another shot, and lay down to die. Ellis almost immediately breathed his last. k French Clocks. A superb collection at E.

(C and D JK- Henderson—The Exulted Views Tn<nj- Twfce »-•/■ the Public Service. [Chicago Tribune, Dec. 7.1 Congressman Jay A. Hnbbel), of Michi gan, was at the Palmer yesterday. j '-What are your chances for United. \ States senator?" asked a Tribune reporter. -"I don't know," replied Mr. Hubbell; "I have been at home sick since the election."* "Are you in favor of civil service re form:"' » " '< ' "Yes, sir. I am in favor of allowing every man to hold any office he likes, as long* as he likes, give him his salary as long as he wants it, and when he gets through present him with a chromo." . j.'-, "Are you going to abolish the 2 per cent, assessment schemes?" "That assessment business was no inno vation. It is an evil lhat has been handed, down to us from the Democrat* in the days-, of Jackson. Two years .ago I was a bully - fellow when I made the assessment. Then nobody kicked. I have caught it pretty well right and left from all sides, but time, will make all things even." "Is Ferry going back to the senate ?."• "Is Christmas going to be ft. pleasant' day ?" retorted Mr. Hnbbel] in return. "How do you* feel on the tariff ques tion?" "I am a protective-tariff man, but I am in favor of a revision of the present tariff. | Everybody knows that it was instituted :! and adopted as a war measure, and that it i contains many incongruities. These I. would eliminate." I would eliminate."' on the abolishment. uHow do you stand on the abolishment . of internal revenue taxation?" "Internal-revenue taxation is not Re publican. It is an anti-Republican method of collecting revenue to support the gov ernment of a free country. It was a .'nat ter instituted by the necessities of the war." "Would you abolish all internal revenue taxes?" "I would, if it could be done. But lam opposed to removing the tux on whisky and tobacco as long ;.s we have a. public debt and soldiers' pens-ions to pay. it will take $125,000,000 to pay the pen sions of the next fiscal year. If wo abolish: all internal-revenue taxes \vo will be. obliged to have a tariff in: revenue. This is undesirable. Of course the government could tax sugar, coffee, tea and the like, which would bring in all the money the government would need to support it. But as long as we have a debt we will have to . allow the tax on whisky and tobacco to re j main." j Mr. Hubbell left for Washington last, | night.
