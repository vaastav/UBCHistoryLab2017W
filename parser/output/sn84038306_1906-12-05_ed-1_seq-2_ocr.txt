MESSAGE President Roosevelt In bis annual message agnin urges tho enactment of law prohibiting corporations from contributing to campaign funds. He also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon tho government the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. Continuing, the president says: cannot too strongly urge the pas sage of the bill Iu question. A failure to pnss it will result iu seriously ham pering the government Iu its effort to obtaiu justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong, and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for wageworkers who are not them selves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior court lias been against them. I have specifically in view a receut decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The importance of enacting into law the particular bill in question Is fur ther Increased by the fact that the gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law In those trust and interstate commerce cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper.Cue of Injunctions. In uiy last message 1 suggested the enactment of a law In connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of Injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts, In which case, of course, the legislation would be Ineffective. More over, I believe it would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of Injunc tions. It is criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law. aud If men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no im pairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year.. Attaint*! Lynching. 1 call your atteutlon aud the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime auioug us and, above all, to the epidemic of lyuching and mob violence that springs up now iu one part of our country, now in another. Each sec tion, north, south, east or west, has its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend its time Jeering at the faults of auother section. It should be busy trylug to amend Its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption It is necessary to have an awakeued public conscience and to supplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certaluty In the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more Is neces sary. A great many white men are lyuched. but the crime Is peculiarly frequent In respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape, the most abominable In all the category of crimes, eveu worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon, and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lyuchlngs are not for rape at all, while a considerable proportion of the individuals lynched «ire innocent of all crime. Tliere is but one safe rule In dealing svith black mcu as with white men. It is the same rule that must be ap plied in dealing with rich men and poor men—that is, to treat each man, whatever his color, his creed or his so cial position, with eveu handed justice jn his real worth as a man. White people owe it quite as much to them selves as to the colored race to treat well the colored mau who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment Chore Is no questiou of social equality negro domination Involved. In my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder. Assault with Intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least iu the discretion of the court, and provision should be made by which the punish ment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense. Xo more shortsighted policy can be iuiagiued than iu the fancied interest of one class to prevent the education of another class. The white man, If tie is wise, will decline to ullow the negroes in a mass to grow to man hood and womanhood without educa tion. "1'reuchern of Mere Discontent." In dealing with both labor aud cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations aud trades unions, there Is one matter more important to re member thau aught else, and that is the infinite harm doue by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class ha tred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of corpora tions and for dolug away with tho Abuses connected with wealth Into a campaign of hysterical excitement and falsehood in which the aim Is to in flame to madness the brutal passions mankind. The sinister demagogues and foolish visionaries who are always oager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to as aociate themselves with those working for a genuine reform In governmental and social methods and sometimes mas pierade as such reformers. Iu reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, just as the purveyors of sensational slander In newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of ail men who are engaged In an houest effort to better what Is bad in our social and governmental condi tions. Corruption is uevcr so rife as in conj inunlties where the demagogue and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands be come loosened, and hysteria and sensa tionalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. In sheer revolt against the squalid anarchy thus produced men are sure In the end to turn toward any leader who can restore order, and then their relief at belug free from the in tolerable burdens of class hatred, vio lence and demagogy Is such that they caiiuot for some time be aroused to in dignation agalust misdeeds by men of vyealth, so that they permit a new trowtlj of the very abuses which were in part responsible for the original out break. The one hope for success for our people lies In a resolute and fear less but saue and cool headed advance aloug the path marked out last year by llils very, congress. There must, be if a i\" j-A a Bterii're'fus'.'.i^io bo' misled "fiifo fol lowlns elihiM- Hint Imse creature who appeals ami p:r.i(k-.-a to tile lowest In stincts aud passions Iu order to arouse one set of Americans against their fel lows or til at other creature, equally base, but no baser, who in spirit of greed or to su'cuimihite or mll to an already huge fortune seeks lo exploit Ills fellow Americans with callous dis regard to their welfare of soul and body. The man who debauches others In order to obtain a high office stands on an evil equality of corruption with the man who debauches others for financial profit, and when hatred Is sown the crop which springs up can only be evil. The plain people who think—the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country aud try to act decently by their neighbors—owe It to them selves to remember that the most dam aging blow that can be given popular government Is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on platform of violence and hypocrisy. Railroad Employees' Honrs. I call your attention to the need of passing the bill Umltlug the number of hours of employment of railroad em ployees. The measure Is a very moder ate one, and I cau conceive of no seri ous objection to it. Indeed, so far as It is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor, with as a goal the general in troduction of an eight hour day. There are Industries in which it Is not pos sible that the hours of labor -should be reduced, just as there are communi ties not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the tropics, so situated that there Is no analogy between their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for Instance, the condi tions are in every way so different from what they are here that an eight hour day would be absurd. Just as it is absurd, so far as the Isthmus Is con cerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the necessary work Is done by alien black men or by nllen yellow men. But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint It should be our object to do what we can iu the direc tion of securing tho general observance of an eight hour day. Let me again urge that the congress provide for a thorough Investigation of the conditions of child labor and of the labor of women In the United States. The liorroj-s Incident to the employment of young children in fac tories or at work anywhere are a blot on bur civilization. In spite of nil precautions exercised by employers there are unavoidable ac cidents and even deaths Involved In nearly every line of business connect ed with tho mechanic arts. It is a great social lujustice to compel the em ployee, or, rather, the family of the killed or disabled victim, to bear the entire burden of such an Inevitable sacrifice. In other words, society shirks its duty by laying the whole cost on the victim, whereas the injury comes from what may be called the legiti mate risks of the trade. Compensation for accidents or deaths due In any line of Industry to the actual conditions un der which that Industry Is carried on should be paid by that portion of the community for Jthe benefit of which the Industry is carried on—that is, by those who profit by the industry. If the entire trade risk is placed upon the employer, he will promptly and prop erly add it to the legitimate cost of pro ductlon and assess It proportionately upon the consumers of his commodity. It Is therefore clear to uiy mind that the law should place this eutlre "risk of a trade" upon the employer. Capital and Labor Disputes. Records show that during the twen ty years from Jan. 1, 1831, to Dec. 31. 1900, there were strikes affecting 117, 500 establishments, and 0,105.004 em ployees were thrown out of employ ment, During the same period there were 1,005 lockouts, Involving nearly 10,000 establishments, throwing over 1,000,000 people out of employment. These strikes and lockouts Involved an estimated loss to employees of $307, 000,000 and to employers of $143,000, 000, a total of $450,000,000. The public suffered directly and Indirectly prob ably us great additional loss. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had the par ties to the dispute been required tc appear before an unprejudiced body representing the nation and, face to face, state the reasons for their con­ tention. The exercise of a Judicial spirit by a disinterested body repre senting the federal government, such as would be provided by commission on conciliation and arbitration, would tend to create aii atmosphere of friend liness and conciliation between con tending parties. Control of Corporations. It cannot too often be repeated that experience has couclusively shown the Impossibility of securing by the actions of nearly hfilf a hundred different state legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not oper ate exclusively within the limits of auy one state. Iu some method, wheth er by a uationffl license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corporations—a control that will, among other things, prevent the evils of ex cessive overcupitalisutlon and that will compel the disclosure by each big cor poration of Its stockholders and of Its properties and business, whether own ed directly or through subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of Inor dinate profits by favored Individuals at the expense whether of the geueral public, the stockholders or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise aud control it as to see that It results In uo harm to the people. Combination of capital, like combina tion of tabor, is a necessary clement of our present industrial system. It Is not possible completely to preveut it, and if it were possible such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combina tion. but to secure such rigorous uud adequate control and supervision of the combinations as to prevent their Injuring the public or existing iu such form as inevitably to threaten Injury, for the mere fact that a combination has secured practically complete cou trol of a uccessary of life would under any clrcumstauccs show that such combination was to be presumed to be adverse to the public interest. It Is unfortunate that our preseut laws should forbid all combinations iustead Of sharply discriminating between those combinations which do good and those combiuatious which do evil. Re bates, for instauce, are as ofteu due to the pressure of big shippers (as was stiowu In the Investigation of the Standard Oil company and as has been shown since by the Investigation of the tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the Initiative of big railroads. Often rail roads would like to combine for the purpose of preventing a big shipper from maintaining Improper advantages at tho expense of small shippers and of the general public. Such a combina tion, instead of being forbidden by law, should be favored. In other words, It should be permitted to railroads to makeagreemeuts, provided these agree ments were sanctioned by the inter state commerce commission and were published. With these two conditions complied with It Is impossible to see what harm such a combination could do to the public at large. Inheritance and Income Tax. The national government has long derived its chief revenue from a tariff on imports and from an Internal or ex cise tax. In addition to these, there is every reason why. when next our sys tem of taxation is revised, the national government should impose a graduated inheritance tax and, if possible, a grad uated income tax. I am well aware that such subject as this needs long aud careful study In order that the people may become fa miliar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceeding with wisdom and self re straint and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go In the matter, while only trained legisla tors can work out the project in neces sary detail. But I feel that in the near future our national legislators should enact a law providing for a graduated Inheritance tax by which a steadily In creasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest or devise to any Individual or corporation. There can be no question of the ethical pro priety of the government thus deter mining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance should be received. As the law uow stauds it is undoubt edly difficult to devise a national In come tax which shall be constitutional. But whether it is absolutely impossible Is auother question, and If possible it Is most certainly desirable. The first purely income tax law was passed by the congress In 1801, but tlie most Im portant law dealing with the subject was that of 1804. This the court held to be unconstitutional. The questiou is undoubtedly very in tricate, delicate and troublesome. The decision of the court was ouly reached by one majority. It is the law of the land and of course Is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Nevertheless the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole In coming to a conclusion, when considered to gether with previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps Indicate the pos sibility of devising a constitutional In come tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The difficulty of amending the constitution Is so great that only real necessity can justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in dealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by the national govern ment over the use of corporate wealth In interstate business, to devise legis lation which without such action shall attain the desired end, but if tills fails there will ultimately be»uo alternative to a constitutional amendment. Indastrial Training* Our Industrial development depends largely upon technical education. In­ cluding in this term all Industrial edu cation, from that which fits a rutin to be a good mechanic, a good carpenter or blacksmith that which (its a man to do the greatest engineering feat. The skilled me» :n!i\ the -'.silled work man, can best become such by tech nical industrial education. The far rcuehlug usefulness of institutes of technology and schools of mines or of engineering Is now universally ac knowledged, nnd no less far reaching Is the effect of a good building or me chanical trades school, a textile or watchmaking or engraving school. In every possible way we should help the wageworker who toils with his hands nnd who must (we hope In a constantly increasing measure) also toll with his brain. Under the constitu tion the national legislature can do but little of direct importance for IiIb wel fare save where he is engaged in work which permits it to act under the in terstate commerce clause of the consti tution, and this Is one reason why I so earnestly hope that both the legis lative and judicial branches of the gov ernment will construe tills clause of the constitution in the broadest possi ble manner. Tlie Farmer. The only other persons whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as is the welfare of tho wageworkers are the tillers of the soli, the farmers. Several factors must co-operate in the improvement of the farmer's con dition. He must have the chance to be educated In the widest possible sense, In the seuse which keeps ever in view ttie intimate relationship between the theory of education and the facts of life. Organization has become necessary in the business world, and it lias ac* compUshed much for good In the world of labor. It is no less necessary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement is good in itself and Is capable of a well nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as It is kept to Its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the as sociation of farmers for mutual ad vantage are partly economic and part ly sociological. Irrigation and Forest Preservation. Much Is now being done for the states of the Rocky mountains and great plains through the development of the national policy of Irrigation and forest preservation. No government policy for the betterment of our Inter nal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. Divorce Legislation. I am well aware of how difficult it Is to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless, lu my judgment, the whole question of marriage an} di vorce should be relegated to the at)? thorlty of the national cougress. The change would be good from every stnudpolnt. Iu particular it would be good because It would confer on the congress the power at ouce to deal radically aud efficiently with polygamy, and this should be doue whether or not marriage and divorce are dealt with. It is neither safe uor proper to leave the question of polygamy to be dealt with by tho several states. Merchant Marine. Let me once again call the attention of the congress to two subjects con cerning which I have frequently be fore communicated with them. One Is the. question of developing American shipping. I trust that a law eqbody ing In substance the views or a major part of the views expressed In the re port on this subject laid beforo the bouse at Its last session will be passed. It seems to {ne that the proposed inaas- ure is as nearly unObjedtlondble as any can be. The Currency, I especially call your attention to the second subject, the coudltlon of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aid ing the enormous business develop ment of tho I'ouutry. and within ten years there has beeu an increase in circulation per capita from J?21.41 to $33.08. For several years evldeuce has beeu accumulating that additional leg islation is needed. The recurrence of each crop seasou emphasizes the de fects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to in cur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation lu the Interest on call money from 2 per cent to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the precediug six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step In and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. 1 do not press any especial plan. Va rious plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bank ers. Among the plans which are possi bly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that re peatedly brought to your attention by the present secretary of tho treasury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers aud business men. According to this plau. national hauks should be permitted to issue a specified propor tion of their capital In notes of a given kind, the issue lo be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notgs back when not wauted In legitimate trade. This plau would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional prof Its, but to meet the emergency present ed by times of stringency. I do not say that this is the light sys tem. I only advauce it to emphasize my belief that there Is need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound banks so as to avoid all possibility of discrimination and favoritism. The law should be amended so as specifically to provide that the funds derived from customs duties may be treated by the secretary of the treas­ ury as he treats funds obtained under the internal revenue laws. There should be considerable Increase In bills of small denominations. Permis sion should be given banks, if necessa ry under settled restrictions, to retire their circulation to a larger auiouut thnn three milllous a month. Our Ootlyintf PoNseMHlonn. I most earnestly hoie that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else abso lute free trade in Philippine products will become a law. No harm will come to any American Industry, and, while there will be some small but real mate rial benefit to the Filipinos, 'the main benefit will come by the showing made as to our purpose to do all In our power for their welfare. Porto lUcnu Affairs. American citizenship should be con ferred ou the citizens of Porto Uico. Tho harbor of San Juan, in Porto Rico, should be dredged and Improved. Tho expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. HawuM. The needk of Hawaii are peculiar. Every aid should be given the islands, and our efforts should be unceasing to develop them along the lines of a com munity of small freeholders, not of great planters with cooly tilled es tates. Alaxka. Alaska's ueeds have been partially met, but there must be a complete re organization of the governmental sys tem, as I have before Indicated to you. I ask your especial attention to this. Our fellow citizens who dwell on the shores of Puget sound with character istic energy are arranging to hold In Seattle tho Alaska-Yukon-Pacific ex position. This exposition hi Its pur poses and scope should appeal not only to the people of the Pacific .slope, but to tho people of the United States at large. Hights of Aliens. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with justice fcud good will all immigrants who come here under tho law. Whether they are Catholic or Protestant. Jew or gentile, whether they come from England or Germauy. Russia, Japan or Italy, mat ters nothing. All we have a right to question Is the man's conduct If he Is honest and upright lu his dealings with his neighbor and with the state, then he is entitled to respect and good treatment. Especially do we need to remember our duty to the stranger within our gates. It Is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate against or in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here lawfully and who is con ducting himself properly. To remem ber this Is incuinbcnt on every Amer ican citizen, and It is of course pecul iarly Incumbent on every government official, whether of the nation or of the several states. I am prompted to say this by the attitude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese In'this country. This hostility Is sporadic and is limited to a very few places. Never theless It is most discreditable to us as a people, aud It may be fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would ask fair treatment for Cier mans or Englishmen. Frenchmen, Rus sians or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization. I ask It as due to ourselves, because we must act uprightly toward all men. I recom mend to the congress that an act be passed specifically "providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come here lutendiug to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrass ments attending the performance of our international obligations Is the fact that tho statutes of the United States are entirely Inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through Unit ed States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens in tho rights secured to them under solemn trcatios which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States bo so amended and add ed to as to enable the president, acting for tho United States government, which Is responsible lu our Interna tional relations, to enforce the rights of aliens uuder treaties. The Cuban Mutter. Uist August an insurrection broke out In Cuba which it speedily grew evi dent that the existing Cuban govern ment wns powerless to quell. Thanks to the preparedness of our navv, I was able Immediately to send enough ships to Cuba to prevent the situation from becoming hopelesa, and I fur thermore'dispatched to Cuba tile-sec retary qf war and the aaaUtaut secre tary of state in order that they might grapple with tho situation ou tho ground. tn accordance with the so calted Piatt amendment, which was embod ied In the constitutions Cuba. I there upon proclaimed a provisional govern ment for tho Island, the secretary of war acting as provisional governor un til he could be replaced by Mr. Magoon. the late minister to Panama and gov: crnor of the uial zone on the isthmus Troops wore '-cut to support them and to relieve the navy, tho expedition be ing handled with most satisfactory speed and efficiency. Peace has come In the island, and the harvesting of tho sugar cane crop, the great crop of the Island, Is about to proceed. When the election has been held nnd the new government inaugurated In peaceful aud orderly fashion the provisional government will come to an eud. The United States wishes notlilug of Cuba except that It shall prosper mor ally and materially and wishes nothing of the Cubans save that they shall be Able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their Independence. If the elections become a farce and if the insurrectionary habit becomes continued on the island It is absolutely out of the question that the Island should continue independent, aud the United States, which has as sumed the sponsorship before the civ ilized world for Cuba's career as a na tlou, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed hi such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The Rio Conference. The second international conference of American republics, held in Mexi co in the years 1901-02, provided for the holding of the third conference within five years and committed the fixing of the time and place aud the arrangements for the conference to the governing board of the bureau of Amerlcau republics, composed of the representatives of all the American nations In Washington. That board discharged the duty Imposed upon It with marked fidelity aud pains taking care, and upon the courteous invitation of the United States of Bra zil the conference was held at Rio de Janeiro, continuing from the 23d of July to the 29th of August last. Many subjects of common Interest to all the American nations were discussed by the conference, and the conclusions reached, embodied In a series of reso lutions and proposed conventions, will be laid before you upon the comlug of the final report of tho American dele gates. Panama Trip. I have jin-t returned from a trip to, •Panama aud shall report to you at length later on the whole subject of the Panama caLal. The Alffeciras Convention. The Algeciras convention, which was signed by the United States as well as by most of the powers of Europe, su persedes th.» previous convention of 1S80, which was also signed both by the United States and a nfajorlty of tho European powers. This treaty confers upon us equal commercial rights with v.ll European countries and does not entail a single obligation of any kind upon us, and I earnestly hope it may be speedily ratified. Sealing* The destruction of the Pribllof is land fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues. The herd, which, according to the survo made In 1874 by direc tion of the congress, numbered 4.700, 000. aud which, according to the sur vey of both American and Canadian commissioners In 1891, amounted to 1,000,000. has now been reduced to about 1S0.000. Tills result has been brought about by Canadian and some other sealing vessels killing the female seals while in the water during their annual pilgrimage to and from the south or in search of food. Tho process of destruction has beeu accelerated during-recent years by the appearance of a number of Japanese vessels engaged In pelagic sealing. Suitable representations regarding the Incident have been made to the government of Japan, and we are as sured that all practicable measures will be taken by that country to prevent auy recurrence of the outrage. Wo have not relaxed our efforts to secure an agreement with (Jreat Brit ain for adequate protection of the seal herd, and negotiations with Japan for the same purpose are in progress. Tin* laws for the protection of the seals within the jurisdiction of the United StMo- need revision and amendment. Hiikuv Conference. in uiy last message 1 advised you that the emperor of Russia had taken the initiatlw in bringing about a sec ond peace m.rcreuce at The Hague. Under th.* guidance of Russia the ar rangement of the preliminaries for nieli a nr'ereuce has been progressing during the past year. Progress has necessarily been slow, owing to the great number of countries to be cou suited upon every question that has arisen. It Is a matter of satisfaction that ail of the Amerlcau republics have now. for the first time, been Invited to Join in the proposed conference. A i*iu y. a ml Navy. It must ever be kept Iu mind that war Is not merely justifiable, but im perative upon honorable meu, upon an honorable nation, where pence can only be obtained by the sacrifice of conscientious conviction or of national welfare. The Unltod State* navy Is the sureBt guarantor of peace which this country possesses. 1 dj not ask that we con tinue to increase our navy. I ask merely thai it be malutaiued at its present stronglh. and this can be doue ouly if we leplace the obsolete and out worn ships by new and good ones, the equals uf any afloat in any navy. To stop budding ship:- for o.ie year means that for that year the navy goes back instead of forward In both tie army and the navy there Is urgent n.'ed that everything possible should be don^ to maintain the highest standard fir the personnel alike as re* gards the o.Jicers and the enlisted men. I do not believe that iu any service there is a liner body of enlisted men and of juuior officers than we have iu both the army and the navy. Including the marine corps. West Pomt and Annapolis already turn out excellent officers. We do uot need to hare these schools made more scholastic. On the contrary, we should novel- lose sight of the fact that tho aim of each school Is to turn out a man who shall bo above everything else a fighting man. There should soon be an Increase In the uumbct* of men for our coast de fenses. These men should be of the right typo and properly trained and there should therefore be an Increase of pay for certain skilled grades, espe cially in the coast artillery. Money should be appropriated to permit troops Jo be massed In body and exerelsed iu maneuvers, particularly In marching.
