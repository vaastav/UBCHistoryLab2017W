Two Tales.?A tight occurred at the foot of King street, last night, between a pointer and a bull dog that la3ted a long time, and attract ed a large crowd, who watched its progress with the liveliest iuterest. Strange to say the poin ter won the fight, and stranger still, the bull dog, when it found that it was whipped, lay as though it were dead, until the pointer, which walked over it aud shook it to make it get up and fight more, went off, when it rose hastily aud rau off. ?Alexandria Gaztte Oct. 12. They have got an intelligent bull-dog in Alexandria, Va., and the boasting among the inhabitants of that flourishing, but somewhat dull town, is something fearful to eomtemplate. The bull-dog had a combat with a fellow cur, and found, in the course of the couflict, that the aforesaid fellow cur was too much for him. When this fact had penetrated his cerebellum he fell flat and motionless to the ground. The victorious dog gave his prostrate form a part iug chew or two, and then strutted about with an air of importance befitting the occasion. In a short time he took up the line ot march for home. As his footsteps were dying away in the distance, the eyes ot the the prostrate dog slightly unclosed. Seeing the victor plodding homeward and on the retreat he opened his eyes wide, and when the victor turned a corner, and was out of sight, the prostrate dog arose lrom the earth, shook the dirt from his gar ments, aud jogged home with a sarcastic smile. ?

ALEXANDRIA, Va.. 2 ~ DECEMBER* 1874. WILLIAM SEAVEll'S MURDER. In the meetiDg of the Society of the Olde3t Inhabitants of Washiogtoo, held io that city on Wednesday night, reference was made to a murder that created intense excitcment in this city at the time of its occurrence. The Wash ington Republican, io alluding to the subject, says: "The discussion io the Society of the Oldest Inhabitants relative to the murder of William Seaver, in 1821, at a point on the Alexandria and Washington turnpike, alougside the turn pike or near the stopping puiut, now called Fort Runyon, recalls the fact that no thorough ly reliable account of that murder has ever been made, aud in the fifty years which have intervened, it has nevor been discovered, not withstanding the rewards offered, by whom the murder was committed. Some twenty years ago a sailor died at the Marine hospital, uear Norfolk, who, it is alleged, confessed that many years before, he could not remember the date, he started, after his discharge from the navy yard, at Washington, with a shipmate, to walk to Alexandria, aud that on the road he met a man from whom they attempted to take some articles of value, and on being resisted they killed him. "A romantic account of the murder and its reasons was published in the Alexan dria Gazette in i860, derived, it was said, from a confession made io Central Amer ica and sent to a member of the Span ish American Legation at Washington.? The murdered man was there stated to be an old man, who, just before the late war, made his home in a cave near Four Mile Run. The only well authenticated facts are that a peddler named William Seaver, having mitred the packet boat then running from Alexandria to Georgetown, left Alexandria on the evening of July 5, 1S21, to walk to Washington, aud that he was never seeu alive after he passed out of towo. Traces of blood were ibutidou the road, near Roach's Spring, and the whole population of the neighborhood, assisted by many persons from Washington and George town, turned out to search for the body. They cut down all the uudergrowth for half a mile, and at last discovered the body under a culvert io a stream near by. A gambling haunt at the spring, uear by, was soon after set ou fire and burned to the ground, and several persons were arrested ou suspicion, but the murderer was never brought to justice. "A similar case of murder.without detection, occurred about a mile from the same point iu the Match of Geo. Pierce's inauguration. The body of a while man, with his throat cut from ear to ear, was discovered a few days after the iuauguration, ou the tow path of the Alexan dria canal, near Arliugtou. The body was brought and exposed to public view iu the jail yard. Among those who saw it was a ieadiug citizen, President of one of the city fire companies, who recognized the body j as that of his wife's uncle, a resident of Charles county, Md. The lady, wheu brought to identify the corpse, exclaimed that it was her uncle, and faiuted; but when a messen ger dispatched to give his family information j of the murder reached the house, the supposed murdered man was sitting at the table cujoyiug a hearty meal. " A photograph of the dead man was taken by Mr. Grubb, of Alexandria, and the mau g!ed body hid from sight under the clods of the valley; but soioe two years afterwards a gentleman from Pennsylvania, whose father had been missing at the time of Pierce's inau guration,came to Alexandria in search of infor mation as to this murder, with a view of ascer taining if the murdered man was uot his brother. Iu this seitrch he called at the news paper offices at Alexandria, and was carried to Mr. Grubb. Upon seeing the photograph he recognized it as that of his brother; but he, too, was mistaken, for the brother returned within a year after this recognition. " If " murder will out " it is a long time gettiug to light in these cases. " Sad Termination of a Honeymoon.?A few days ago the firm of A. W. Mitchell & Co., brokers aud iueurauce agents, doing business ou the northeast corner of Third aud Chestnut streets, became convinced that there were ir regularities in their office, and, after careful watching and investigation, suspicion fastened ou Thomas Conboy, their bookkeeper, who, on being charged with the crime, admitted that he was guilty, aud accordingly he was lacked up at the Chestnut street Police statiou last Saturday afternoon, aud yesterday a warrant was sworn out in the Court of Criminal Cor rection by Andrew C. Travis, one of the firm of A. W. Mitchell & Co., charging him with embezzling four hundred and thirty dollars. Conboy is rather a fine looking young man of about twenty-five years, neat in appearance, and said to be an excellent bookkeeper. His father aud mother reside in this city, having formerly lived in Belleville, where they were highly respected. The aged couplc are almost heart-broken at the sin of their son and would gladiy have made restitution and hushed the matter up if it were possible, but their re sounds are so limited that this was an impos sibility. But there is another and perhaps a sadder feature in this case. Young Conboy had been paying devoted attentions to a young and beuutiful lady for sometime, who requited i his affections by giving him her heart and hand, and on Friday eveuiug last, but one short day prior to his arrest, the two were juin ed in wedlock. After learning of his crime aud arrest, the bride of a day gave way to violent expressions of grief and sorrow, utterly refus ing to be comforted. Her ruaideu name is with held out of respect to herself and family. The peccadilloes ol Mr. Conboy roach back as far as last Jul)*, and were managed in such a man ner as not to create suspicion until the denoue ment. Another feature of this unfortunate ease is that it is said the money thus surrepti tiously obtained was lavished on another lady than the on? who subsequently wedded him.? St. Louis C'.oie, Dec. 1. "Is the sense of smelling more pleasing than the sense of feeling? ' was the sulject up bc iore a debating club. Skiltou was the last to speak upon the negative, aud all were anxious to hear him, wheu, ringing the bell, he order ed up a glass of hot whiskey punch, and drauk it off with great gusto. Then, turniog to his opponents, lie handed the empty ^lass t0 the leadiogdisputaut,and thundered out: "Nowsir, smell it!" It is needless to add that Skiltou "brought down the house," and carried thede- ' cision for the negative. An old pioneer who believed that 14 what was to be would be, " lived in a region infest ed by Indians. He always took his gun with him, aud once, finding that some of his family had taken it out, he would not go without it. Hi> friends rallied him, saying that there was no danger of the Indiaus, as he would not die till his time came anyhow, "Yes," said old Leatherstocking; " but suppose I was to meet an Indiau, and his time was come, it wouldn't do not to have my gun.

LOCAL NEWS. Tiie Late Kailroad Accident.?The fol lowing description of the late accident on the Midland Railroad, a correct account of which was published in yesterday's Gazette, is taken from the Washington liepublioau : "A railroad accidentoccurreu yesterday morn ing on the Virginia Midland, formerly the Orange railroad, which, although not attended by fatal results, caused a number of ugly bruises and a long and tiresome delay to the passen gerp. The train, consisting of a baggage, two passenger cars aud one Pullman sleeper, left Kichmoud at the usual hour the previous night, having on board, among other passengers, the District Knights Templar, who were returning from their visit to New Orleans. After being on the road for some time, the engineer, Mr. Charles Demaiue, discovered that his force pump was out of order. He continued on, however, until about 4 o'cluek, at which time he was wiihiu a mile of llapidau station. Here he stopped the train, and with the fireman alighted aud attempted to repair the damage. "This spot, one of the worst ou the ruad, is known as the 85-lbot grade from the fact that within a short space of four or five miles the grade is very heavy. Near by it, too, is an uuly curve through a deep cut. The train had not been standing long when the engineer heard the whistle of an approaching freight train through the gap. He states that he at once sprang on his engine aud opened the throttle-valve lor the purpose of attemptiug to escape by flight, but he was too late. Befure he got under woy the engine of the other train was halfway through the Pullman sleeper, and the other ears were so mixed up that one could hardly have known in which car ihey were. The passengers who had been sleeping peace fully were awakened by the concussion aud thrown from their berth? to the floor, many of them wounded aud bleediuj;. Takieg in the situation at a glance, most of them attempted at coce to extricate themselves, and >.oou ail w^re on the ground. Now comes a curious aud thrilliug poniou of the story. "The coucussiou had entireiy broken the platform oil the ear next the sleeper, and they were conssequi utly dotached. Aud it haJ also, so he alleges, thrown the engineer from his po sition down asteep embankment, not, however, before the traiu was in motion, with the throt tle valve open and a lull head of steam, and on went the uuwrecked portion faster aud faster. Astounded and bewildered at this, the passen gers at once begun to pud the bell roup, but to their frautic efforts there was no response, aud on went the runaway. Luckily for all con cerned amoug the passengers was Mr. James Katup, an engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio liuilroad, aud he, divining that the engineer had been killed, left his seat, crawled thmugh and over cars uutil he had reached aud stopped the runaway engine after it had traveled about five miles, and with it returned to the station. Three of the ears of the freight train were up set, aud three booves killed. The village was soou apprised of the fact and helping hands were soon ahuut ministering to the needs of the wounded. Among the more noticeable of these good Samaritans were J>r. C.C. Conway, of liapidan, who dressed all the wouixie with-1 out charge; and Mrs. Cobell, of the same vil lage, who kindly and generously furnished them with meals. ?'Help was soon Fccurcd and the work of clear ing the wreck entered upon, but it was i> p. m. when the party, sore aud excited, reached this city, thankful, however, it was uo worse. "The easuaiiiies are reported as follows: C. M. Payne, of Teunaliytuwn, three cuis in the head aud hack; Mr. J. W. Bowers, ol Baltimore cut in the forehead over left eye; 1J. I). Bote ler, of this city, badly bruised in several places; Thomas L. Titus, of Piiillipsburg, N. J., hurt inwardly; Pnil Wilson, of Washington, bruised in the neck and shoulders; James Howard, of Washington, badly hurt iu the back; J. Y. Potts ol Washington, cut iu the forehead and a beautiful black eye. "Mr. Charles Shaffer, of Richmond, was the most severely injured ul the party, being seri ously wouuded about the head and face. This gentleman was on his bridal tour, but luckily his wife escaped without injury. "The engineer of the stock train, Mr. George M. Keys,says that as soon an he uoticed the train ahead of his own he reversed his engine, but it was too late to do any good. Jie, however, stood to bis post, aud after the accident did all in his power to aid the others." The Washington correspondent of the Balti more Sun writes: "The pa-seuger train bouud north, uuder charge of (Japt. John Fossett, bad been detained some time, near Gordons ville, on account of an accident to the eccentric of the engine. Running out of time Orange Court House was reached, when the machinery again got out of fix, and another stop was made to repair damages. Just at this time a stock train, which had been ordered to follow in the wake of the passenger train, made its appear ance arouud a sharp curve in the road, and de spite the efforts of the engineer his engine ran into the sleeping coach of the passenger train with great force. One passenger was knocked through the window of the car and landed on terra firmu some ten feet off. The ear was a complete wreck. The occupants of the car were principally Knights Templar from Bos tou, New York, Philadelphia and other North ern cities, with several from Baltimore. After the sleeping coaah had been detached the re mainder of the passenger train started down a grade of seventy feet to the mile towards Ru pi dan Station, and the engineer, after having put on stcan, tor soule cause jumped from the speediug train, followed closely by the fireman. At this juncture two brave youug men, named Spears aud Kemp, crawled through the bag gage car aod over the tender to the engineer's cab, and shut off the steam, by which meaus the train was brought to a halt, after running six miles. In all some forty persons were more or less injured. The passengers unite in exon erating (Japt. Fossett frouj any derilection of duty, but are of opinion that there was a want of proper precaution somewhere. Nearly all the male passengers wouuded were Knights Templar, returning from the triennial conven tion at New Orleans. Their injuries amounted chiefly to scratches and bruises." U.

Found Dead in Bed.?The Washington Chronicle of this morning says: "Ou Friday cveniug lust a mau called at the American House and registered his name as VV. Osterhold. He was noticed to bo some what unwell by the clerk, and wcut to his room about 5 o'clock uu Sunday, where he re mained until 12 uj. yesterday, when the cham bermaid iouud him dead iu his bed. The body was tnken to the Central Guardhouse, and a post mortem examination was held, and the cause of death ascertained to be apoplexy. No papers were found upon the body by which it could be identified, and the coroner ordered that the body be held for recognition uutil to day, when an inquest will probably bo hold. The body had not been identified at a late hour last night, hut it was thought by many who viewed it to be that of Prof. J. C. Foertsch, formerly a well-known music teacher ot this city, but latterly a resident of Alexandria." If the supposition proves correct the numer ous friends of Mr. Foerltsch in this city will re gret his sudden death. Since the above was put in type some gen tlemen of this city, who went to Washington to inspect tho corpse have returned aud report that the body is not that of 31 r. Foertsch, but of a man frequently, of late, seen here, aud sup posed to be from Fairfax county, though it has uot yet been fully identified. County' School Lew. ? At a meeting of the Board of Supervisors of Alexandria coun ty, held at the Court House, yesterday after neon, the Superintendent of Schools, hs Presi dent of the Couuty School Board, laid before the Sup&rvibors the estimates lur 1875? 70; whereupon the amouuts asked for, 2] cents on the $100 for the county; l'J cents for Jeffer son J).strict; 32 cents for Arlington,and 45 cents fur Washington, were levied, by a unanimous vote. Taken as a whole, the county ol Alex dria has, probably, better schools than auy other c<?unty iu the State. The teachers are all persons ol' high qualifications, and, mostly, of long expcrieuc'', and the sessions last elev en school mouili.-, while no otiier couuty runs its sehoois more than ten. The tcachers, too, are always promptly paid, which, we believe, is uot the case clsewnere. A new colored school has been opened, with about fifty pupils, just beyond the city limits. It is called "Scott School," out of respect for the memory of the late Sylvester Scott, Coun ty Superintendent before the war, and is very i acceptably taught by Miss Mary D. Lane. Washington and Alexandria Turnpike. ? The proceedings instituted by certain prop erty holders of Alexandria county to have Judge Sangster declare the Washington and Alexandria turnpike abandoned, cauie up, yes terday, iu the County Court of Alexandria ciuuty, as stated in the (jazette of that date, upon the defendant's ruotiou fur a continuance. The judge postponed the hearing of the facts uniil Wednesday, and by consent of counsel the deposition of Albeit llewsoo, the clerk and treasurer of the turnpike company, who resides iu Philadelphia, was taken, to be read at. the trial. The deposition sets forth that the turn pike company is in tiie full possession aud ope ration ol all its franchises and denies any inten tion of abandonment. F. L. Smith and 8. F. Beach appeared as counsel i'ur defendants and D. L. Srnoot for the petitioners. Police Report.?'The following cases have been reported at Police Headquarters siuee yesterday afternoon : Tabitha Peters, a colored woman seventy seven years old, deserted by her people, was sent to the Poor's House. Mary Casey and Mary Travers, for assault ing and attempting to cut Peter Mullhouser, were dismissed as the complainant failed ro ap pear, aud tho police ordered to arrest Mull houser on sight. The above eases were before the Mayor. Samuel Davis, colored, was committed to jail by Justicc French for stealing a coat from aud threateoiug another colored man named Arthur Jones. Ten lodgers were accommodated at the sta tion house last night. Meeting of County Supervisors.?The Board of County Supervisors met yesterday, as stated in the Gazette of that day. They re ceived the report of the committee appointed to inspect the jail and ordered all election claims to be paid out of the contingent fund, and levied au a&sessment of llJ cents on the hundred dollars worth of real estate aod per sonal property in Jefferson township, 45 cents iu Washington township, and 32 ceuts iu Ar lington township, for the support of the pub lie schools for the year 187.0-6. The Origin of Foundling Asylums.?It is said that St. Viueent de Paul came to found the present hospice for foundlings from an in cident which occurred one day while walking through .Paris. He saw a beggar deforming the members of an iulant for the purpose of inspiring pity, when this man of zeal rushed forward and took the suffering child away from bim aud carried it to his uiece, by whom it was uursed. This was the first foundling, aud it gave to its savior the idea with which his name is connected; hence arose the asylums in Frauce, aud especially iu Paris, devoted to the cause of unfortunate babes. Yet the first effect ot the asylum which he established in Paris was not iu accordance with the object for which it was designed, for when it became geueraliy kuown that such an establishment existed iu the capi tal, iufants arrived from all quarters of France, wheu transport was less expeditious and com modious than now, and the result was, owiug to lengthy journeys, inadequate or improper food, aud exposure, that his hospice was turn ed into a sepulcher. Meeker affirms that nine out of ten died within two weeks after their ar rival. The project of St. Viuceot de Paul at first met with au enthusiastic support from the well-to-do people of his parish, but in cuurse of time the enthusiasm cooled, the founder's hands were empty, and his foundlings suffered for want of care aud uourishmeut. At this juncture he preached oue of the most eloquent sermons of his life, in wnich he made his hear ers, who had promised aid in behalf of aban doued children, responsible for their death. I bis appeal had the desired effect; means were promptly furnished, and the work of charity was eontiuued. The institution now occupies a haudsome site behind the Paotheon, froutiug the Rue d'Eufer. It forms a group of build ings, situated on high ground, in the midst of courts and gardens. It was here the tour was first introduced. 

TELEGRAPHIC NEWS. [SPECIAL DISPATCHES TO THE GAZETTE.] F1C09I WASHINGTON. Congress. Washington, December S, 1.S74. The sparcely filled galleries in the Senate and House of Representatives presented, to-day, a marked contrast with the crowded benches of yesterday. SENATE. Hon. J. W. Johnson, of Virginia, appear ed in his seat at the opening of the Senate to day, but Mr. Lewis was absent. A number of memorials from newspaper pub lishers and others, asking a change iu the pos tal law relative to prepayment of all periodical postage, one of which wa9 presented by Mr. Johnsou, of Va., were referred to the Commit tee ou Postoffices aod Postroads. A bill to promote economy of the hospital service, aod a number of other bills were in troduced aod referred. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. The House of Representatives, on the report of the Committee on Banking and Currency, after an explanation by Mr. Durham, of Ken tucky, passed a bill amending the National Bank act so as to provide a gross hum per diem to be paid baak examiuers iuitead of $5 per day and mileage as now. A number of reports of committees were made and their consideration proceeded with. THE SAEE BURGLARY CASE. The safe burglary case came up to-day in the Criminal Court. Mr. Riddle, for the prosecu tion announced his retirement from the case and said that the Attorney General would com musiicatc to the court his intentions as to ihc further triai of the case. I The President's Message. New York, Dec. 8.?The Herald says: "The message of Graut is a more creditable ducumcnt, both in point of reasoning and lite rary execution than its predecessors from the same source. The President makes it clear enough that in his view the three principal causes which have led to the disastrous defeat of his party are prostration of business, the condition of the Southern States, and the un successful experiment of reforming the civil service. This is not directly stated, but it is necessarily implied in the texture of his views ou those suljects. The sum of the message,s>o far as it has a party bearing,is the committal of the President to the restoration of a sound cur rency, an implied promise to treat the South with lenity and justice, and abandon the civil service reform unless Congress supports it by legislation. This is the programme of Presi dent Grant for reinstating the republican party. The President has got the Spanish question into such a state that it can be fanned into a flame whenever he thinks it expedient, and he relies on the country to support him in the war in which the abolition of slavery iu Cuba aud breaking the yoke of colonial servitude will be the leading ideas. But Gen. Graut makes a stupendous mistake if he thinks he can play this desperate game with suecess. If he has "pigeon-holed" our just complaint against Spain with such ujjpurpose he will have cause to rue the day wheu ho meditated such a trick. The financial recommendations of the message are sound iu principle but defective in details." The Times considers the President's views on finances have undergone no change aud his proposition to repeal the legal tender clause is sound. The President in stating he wiil still sustain Kellogg, does not say what he will do about Packard or Casey, which is a pity. The Times thiuks the Pres ident's reference to Southern matters is plaiu advice, given iu kindness and frankness. "We arc sorry that ho announces his intention of abandoning the civil service reform unless Con gress distinctly supports it by legislation. It was an attempt that promised much and mieht have been made to yield a great deal. With his recommendations as to specie pay ment and free banking we are in entire sym pathy.'' The Tribune considers this the best message of'the President, probably because written un der the chastening of the late elections. It condemns his position towards Louisiana but commends maiuly nearly all the rest of the message. The Sun says the President's message i? reasonably souud, theoretically, ou hard money aod a return to specie payments, but the Pres ident's arguments are not as urgent as his theories are souud, while some of his plans for retiring our paper money and reviving gold and silver as a circulating medium will pro voke severe criticisms not only of the inflation ists, but of the hard money men as well.? With the exception of his recommendation of free banking the views be now expresses con cerning currency are but a reiteration of bis veto of the green-back bill of the last session. The World says : President Grant and Sec retary Bristow are less in doubt than the re publican press and politicians, as to the signi ticauce of the overthrow of their party in the late elections. They have reached a clear opinion, by what means, if by any means, polit ical revolution can be stopped midway aod the Democratic party hiudered from taking posses sion of every department of the Govern ment, in actions of 1876; immediate steps towards specie payment taken, not promised ; of which the execution is perpetually postpon ed and a reform of tariff to the end of obtain ing larger revenues by lower duties on fewer articles. This, their concurrent advice, exhi bits the President's aod the Secretary's appre ciation at last of the great evils from which the country is suffering and their admission, that those evils are of legislative origin and admit of legislative remedy; add to these the exorbi tances and usurpations of power on the pare of the Federal Government aud Gen. Grant and Secretary Bristow will have discovered precise ly the vulnerable points in the republican policy upon which the democratic assaults has been concentrated and are irresistible. They advise CoDgrcss to abaudon the defence of what is in defensible and to frustrate further Democratic victories by themselves, now doiue- what ihe despairing people have elected the next Demo cratic Congress to do. The .Strikes. New York, Dcc. 8.?A Pittsburg dispatch says the puddlers' strike began yesterday, and at least fifteen thousand men are out of em ployment, some Tour hundred furnaces being blown out. The puddlers on Saturday, in con ference with the manufacturers, refused the scale of prices offered by the latter, hence the strike. One firm yesterday refused an order for seven thousand tons of iron from an East ern house. There will undoubtedly be jcreat suffering, as very few of the puddlers have any mouey ahead. The Longshoremen^' Society have rescinded the order that their members shall not work with non-society men. Their strike is proving a perfect fiasco. NO. 306. FOR SJiLE OR
