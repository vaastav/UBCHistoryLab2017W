These efforts had been continued through long course of offensive legislation, car ried on through the instrumentality of the Democratic T.aitv. Tim iiiiiionstinn tlino excited increased in extent and intensity at each new act of offense, until upon thc repeal of the Missouri Compromise iu 1831, it acquired a force, which affected a rup . ture of all old party ties, and manifested itelf in the new Republican organization, ' This organization had for its distinct objects, thc relief cf thc industrial inter-1 esu ottuc country, from the depressing innuescc tf the policy of the prevailing ' party in the slave-holding States, and the establijhnicnt of thc policy of thc legisla- : tion of the country, on the subject of sia-, - xerj, in cDufennity with the policy of thc j constitution, as that policy was unicrstood - in the early days of thc llcpublic .

Cox ojened the t argument for thc State, and was f jllowcd , ly Hutchins and Forrist for defence and i Mr. Tnttlc making thc closing argument for the State. Thc esse was given to thc I jury in thc following charge in substance: lhc Judge stated that the Indictment charges ..an unlawful . assault, unlawful wounding, unlawful killing and murder; that under this indictment thc prisoner could lc found guilty of assault and bat tery only, or manslaughter only, murder in thc 2d degree only or murder in the 1st degree, according as the evidence and law should warrant That in order to find the prisoner guilty of murder iu thc 1st degree, it was necessary to Cud, an actual killing by defendant's own act an unlawful kil ling, purjiosely killing, and a killing of deliberate and premet'iuled raalL-c. Does the evidence show that prisoner actuuUy killed Reeves; did he kill him unlawfully; or did he kill hira by accident or mishap, or in self-defence against imminent bodily harm? If prisoner nnlawfully stabbed and killed lUevcs, did he do it purposely? '1 ho purpose and iulcnt is an esscutial iagredient of murder in cither the 1st or 2nd degree. Does prisoarr's acts and say ings shortly before, at aud after the death of ltecvcs show an intent to kill? The State, by its counsel, insists that thc cir cumstances, via thc condition of defend ant, his : locality, his being stripped, his preparation by knife, the manner of the assault, thc place in thc body stabbed, thc force of the stab, thc sayings cf the defend ant, just before, Lis sayings and conduct just after and his fii-ht. clearly proves the intcut to kill Reeves'." The couhscI of de fendant insists, that thc proof is no,t cer tain, reliable or creditable, as to any claimed circumstances, act, fact or saying; that there was no grudge, or provocation shown to exist for an intcut; that the par tics were all druu or intoxicated, so as not to know what was K'ing dope, or so inflamed and crazed wiih intoxication as not to have any reflection or purpose be yond a mere mad or drunk melee; that thc stab, if made by defendant intelligently and intentionally as a slab, was not made with intent or dcsi.m to kill, but merely towcu&J; that the location of thc wound shows a want of intent to kill; that if such an intent exL-tcd he would have aimsd his i blow at a tn,u?n vital part of thc body, , Le would have aimed higher up; that he i struK below merely to wound, and to avoid killing, but in doing so, he acciden tally cut an artery, thc locality of which was unknown to him and to people gcnerallv; that the wound being in thc groin, medical evidence proves, that a stab in that region was not in general experience of common racn, or of defendant, fatal or naturally o? ordinarily calculated to produce death; and insists, that in dcfciiuanti opportunity. i his stab that low down, was proof that he JiJ not intend to kill, but merely to wound, . t'aat the vital artery was cut unexpectedly ta defendant, and death caused unin ten- tionallyl Thc defendant's counsel, insists that if defendant njeaut to kill, he would natur ally and readily, as be easily could, have plunged his knife into thc body of Reeves, higher up, and not reached down below the main vital body. Xow gentlemen, you will carefully weigh thc cstablitdicd and creditable facts and circumstances ou this pcint and fee how it is. E'id defendant stab, where he did, and as he did, wiih intent to kill Reeves ? Docs the proof aud circumstances satisfy you clearly and beyond the existence of a reasonable doubt, that defendant stabbed. with intent to kill, and not with intent to i WOun 1 merely ? Jf Lc did r.ot with intent to kill, clearly; then you cannct find Liui guilty of murder jn either dcrca lfyou ate convinced clearly, that defen dant stabbed Reeves with intent to kill, then go further and find whether be did so maliciously. Malice, iu its general common acceptation, siguiue3 enmity of heart malevolence disposition to injure others without cause, from mere personal gratification or spirit of revenge, unprovok ed malignity, or spite. Malice, in Law, means a dispositit n to do another a hurt or injury without lawful authority or ex cuse. An act injurious to another is le gally rualiciwus, if done knowingly, purpose ly aud without legal authority, justificxtion or excu.'e. An injury to the person, such as assault, battery, wounding or killing is legally malicious, if done purposely by one having sanity and intelligence euough to know right fioai wrong, and being a free agent aud responsible ftr bis acts, aud done with in cut to injure and without any legal exctrse, justification or authorjty- Malicc implies turpitude of micd and heart, evil disposition; recklessness of thc rights of others. Jn regard to taking life, it means rcci lcssucss of life, of social duty, in that res pect of extreme turpitude and malignity of disposition. Malice is either express or intplicd from circumstances. It is express where one utters or gives vent in words to his evil intent and disposition towards another. It is implied without any words, from acts and circumstances, where these show au evil intent and disposition iu their nature, kind, appearance and result . The words niaiicc, or maliciously, may have been intended, in the sections of the statute, in question, to supply the lace, to some extent, of the word unlawful, which is not used in this statute. Where a killing is done intelligently, that is done knowingly by a sane person, done purpose ly, done without any authority of law, aud without accident, mistake or self do sence, it would seem necessarily to be im plied that it was malicious. You must be satisfied from all thc proof, that malice I accompanied the intent to kill, if there was such an intent If you arc not clear ly satisfied that he had malice towards i!riVtc rbnt bo cfnblmrl fit l.im nnrruic,1 r amj ' i:,.:,,.,.. ;ti, ;ntclJt to kill biiru-' tlicn too could not fiuJ Lini cuiltv f ma'r- dcr in either degree.

All persons of age. ordinarily sane and j in cood health, are presumed to remain cooU health, are r resumed to remain ram, until the contrary appears by proof. A mere vicious act doss not raise the pre sumption of insanity. If you arc satisfied that Defendant wa3 intoxicated to any extent in asniuch as that clouds thc understanding, and has a tendency to excite passion, yon may look to it and sec whether it furnished evidence of passion only, and rebuts any idea of malice or design iu thc killing You will carefully look at Defendant's condition and all the circumstances well established, and determine clearly in your own mind what he did. what he intended beforehand, what he then intended, what stitc cf mind, motive and malice he was iu when he did thc act if he did it, and when you shall be clearly satisfied and convinced, you will say, on your oaths, from thc testimony, under thc instructions and rules iven for your guidance, just what you believe to be the truth, as to thc charges made. 1st. Did defendant purposely and of his. delilcrate and premeditited malice, (by stabbing with intent to kill.) kill Archi bald Reeves, Jun. unlawfully? If you are satisfied beyond thc existence of any reasonable doubt, upon the neces sary ingredients of this oHeacc. tliat be did, then you will say guilty of murder in thc 1 st degree. " If you are not thus clearly satisfied, and convinced, then you will pass further. 2d. Did defeudant purjKiscly and mali ciously, but without deliberation and pre meditation, by stabbing with intent to kill, kill Reeves unlawfully. If yea, then your verdict should be guil ty of murder in thc 2d degree. If yon avc not clearly satisfied cf this then you should go further. Sd. Did defendant unlawfully kill Reeves, (without malice.) upon a sudden quarrel, by stabbing him, or, unintention ally, while in thc commission of thc unlaw ful act of gabbing. If you are sati-fiod that defendant un lawfully assaulted and stabbed Reeves, not iu self-defince, but with iutcnt merely to wound or iujurj Reeves, aud not to kill him. then defendant would I cuilty of manslaughter, and that should be your verdict. If defendant did not stab Rcevc3 at all, or you arc not clearly satisfied that he did the stabbing, then defendant is not guilty of any offence charged." Thc J ury then retired for deliberation. At bh P. M. (having been out less than an hour.) thc Jury having agreed upon a verdict, returned into court, thc prisoner being present Thc verdict was guilty of murder iu thc second degree.

A Woman in Adams county, Ind.. being about to chum butter, threw some boiliii2 water in the churn, into which one of the children had, unnoticed by the mother, rla ced an infant, and it was instantly scalded to death. In her frenzy thc mother seiz ed a chair and inflic'ed a death blow upen the little girl. After realizing what she had done, she threw herself into the well, and was drowned.
