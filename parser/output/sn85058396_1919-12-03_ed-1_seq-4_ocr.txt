The spread of the doctrines of the BolfhtMkl Is due to the upsetting er iect of the war. There is not a part of the world where uncertainly does not prevail. Prices of all commodities have crone upward so rapidly that wages, in many instances, have not kept pace, and. as ; a result, the wage earners express their grievances in strikes, am' not a few throw themselves into the arms of the radicals who would break down all industry and on the ru.nn . tteiupt to build communes. THE KAISER RESPONSIBLE. Digging down Into the diplomatic correspondence in the government ar chives at Berlin, thoe at piesent in power bave proved to ihe reicttstttfl that the former kaiser not only want ed war in ihe early days of July, 1914, but rebuked those about him who showed any disposition to avoid ihe mighty clash at arms.

William Carlisle, the (Jhlon Pacific train bandit, is back in custody. It la well that no man of the bra vado of Carlisle should succeed, be cause one success of that Kind might have a bad effect on an army of youxfe men to whom daring adventure would have a strong appeal. Carlisle displayed an egotism which indicated a form of insanity.

In his message to congress yester day. President Wilson made no rfrmn mendations over which there could be any great divergence of opinion based jpurely on political lines. The recom mendations included Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation sys tem with simplification of the ncome and excess profits. I Readjustment of the tariff system; If 'necessary to meet changed world con ditions and make the system conform- with the fact that the United States lis "the greatest capitalist m the world." Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war particularly m the way of governmen' f irms as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the de stuffs industry built up during the war, to keep the United States lr.de-Ii-;id'-nl nf foreign supph An enlarged program for rural de elopment, in recognition of Ihe farm ers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politic' One paragraph in the president -message runs parallel to the editor ial tAtMnnnls nf Tlii. Slniiflaril r.n ffirr.ion trade.and is as follows- During the war America's ex ports have been greatly stimulat ed, and increased prices have in creased their value. On the other hand, she has purchased a large proportion of the American secur ities previously held abroad, has loaned some $9,000,000,000 to for eign governments, and has bulk her own ships. Our favorable bal ance of trade has thus been great ly increased and Europe has been deprived of the means of meeting it heretofore exifting. Europe can have only three ways of meeting the favorable balance of trade in peace times: By Im ports into this country of gold or of goods, or by establishing new credits. Europe is in no po. ition at the present time to ship goid to us, nor could we contemplate large further shipments of gold into this country without concern The time has nearly passed for inter national governmental loans, and it will take time to develop In this country a market for foreign securities. Anything, therefore, which would tend to prevent for eign countries from settling for our exports by shipments of goods Into this country could onlV have the effect of preventing Ihem from pajlng for our exports, and . therefore of preventing the ex ports from being made. The pro ductivity of the country, greatly stimulated by the war, must find an outlet by exports to foreign countries and any measures taken to prevent imports will In evitably curtail exports force cur tailment of production, load the banking machinery of the coun try with credits to carry unsold products and produce industrial stagnation and unemployment. If we want to sell, we must be pre pared to buy Whatevei , therefore, may have been our views uring the period of growth of American business concerning tariff legisla tion, we must now adjust our owu economic life to a changed condi tion growing out of the fact that American business is full grow n. and that America is the greatest capitalist in the world. oo 

JAPANESE PICTURE BRIDES. Dispatches of the early part of the week told of a controversy in Califor nia over the picture brides of the Jap anese. What are picture brides'' The question Is answered .iy the San Francisco Chronicle, which is rot unfriendly to the brides. The Thron icle says: Since that holiday in Rome When Romulus' young men solved lh'' domestic problem by seizing the Sabine maidens the cry of ev ery' people living in a new land has been for wives. Since th'- day when the children of Benjamin lay in wait in the vineya.ds by tho highways from Bethel to Shechem and every mqn caught his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, every womanless tribe has been determined to repair the de ficient by the best means that offers. Then why should not the Japan ese In California want wives1 Thej are not, we see, attempting either Roman wiles, or the meth ods of Benjamin. They sen,l a pho tograph back to Nippon, where a Japanese maiden, duly selected by ih'' family matebmaket s, weds 'he portrait and thereupon Jou-neys I'ross the sea to find at Angel is land, with the help of the identi fying picture, the mate of her soul. She is a lawful wife, says tl e Jap anese government, and our- ac quiesces, recognizes as it does 'ha marriage Institutions of other countries so long as no harem is involved. We recall that early European settlers in this and other land., suffered from the samo dearth of lovely woman and made good the lack by means not so different after all. Shiploads of Priscillas were freighted over to New Enrr land to join John Aldenn they had never seen. If anything, that scheme was worse than the Jan anese picture plan, it was 'he .sheerest of matrimonial lotteries, either party was buying an abso lute pig in a poke. Can we doubt that if photography had been in vented then the Pilgrims would not have used it? The early settlers of Louisiana received with cheers cargoes of French girls, to whom they had never been Introduced. California pioneers can recall the time when most any man here would have been willing to marry a crayou portrait of a woman of his race. We find among a proportion of the California Japanese a credit itable spirit in relation to the pi. -ture bride question If it jj cou irary to American law, they say, or even if it offends the American idea of propriety and fitness, the practice should be stopped This is sound doctrine, and one that goes far toward friendliness. The problem, from the Ameri can point of view, is wholly one of the increase of Japanese popula tion in this country. It is eco nomic, not moral. We can hardly dictate to the Japanese govern ment that its picture marriage institution is Illegal any more than we can tell the French go ernment that its requirement of a clil marriage is unlawful. But Americans are alarmed at the in crease of Japanese as domestic competitors. Japanese families are prolific and a fear is abroad that the result of the gentlemen's agreement curtailing immigration may he undone by swarming fami lies reared on our soil. From many points of view the ple'urc bridr question is difficult. We do not believe it is to be settled bj brickbats or shouting, the move ment among the Japanese them selves seems to point an easlor and better way. If they settle It themselves it will be a proof of friendliness that we cannot deny. 00 MEMORIAL SERVICES OF IE ELKS ON SUNDAY Memorial services in honor of the 90 members who have died will be conducted by Ogden lodge No 719, B.
