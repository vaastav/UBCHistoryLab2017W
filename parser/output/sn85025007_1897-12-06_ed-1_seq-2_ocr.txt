monday eveking. dec. 6, 1>?7. In respect of Cuba, the Presid< nt while expressing views that mus', the Dature of thing?, be very irritating to Spain, hopes that she may be allow? ed time enough to test the effective? ness of the new measures she has adopt ed for the pacification of her insurgent subjects in Cuba. If, however, af er such a test, the latter be cot ra:i?fi- d, he will, he says, not hesitate to inter? fere, in behalf of the "inalienable rights of man." But what the United States have to do with the inalienable rights ' Of men in Cuba, an island belonging to a friendly nation?so friendly that she has just released ail of her prison? ers who though known to Cuban?, claimed to be Americans, and thouL't they were arrested with arm3 in theii hands, fighting for the subversion of bei authority in that inland. The President says if nothing be done to increase the revenue there must be a new issue of bonds. As present appearances indicate tbfcl nothing will be done, a further increase of the public debt, in lime of prace &~>: "assured prosperity," and a consequent increase in taxation to meet the in ' creased interest account, may ire cot li dently expected. Which of course is just a3 it should be, for the people, bv their vote?, declared that it should be eo; when they elected a republic.it President and Congress last year and it is well known, that is, to the den'i> gogues, that the voice of the people is the voice of God. The President is in favor of con? tinuing the redemption of greenbacks with gold, but for exchanging iMta only for gold; of allowing bankscircua tion to the full amount of the face value of their bonds, and of reducing by half the tax on their notes, and of establi.-h ing banks of $25,000 capital. None or all of which, it is needless to say, would improve tLo existing depressed con Htion of the country in the sliglit tst imaginable degree. The President recommends the im? mediate annexation of Hawaii, though, at the same time, he professes to be in favor of home rule. There are one hundred and ten thousand people iu Hawaii, of whom, at the highest esti? mate, three thousand and they foreign? ers, are in favor of annexation, all the others being opposed to it. But the President's words and deeds have often disagreed._ As hoi'E springs enterual in the hu mm breast, Mr. McKinley hopes that Mr. Foster, the American reciprocity agent, wiil bo able to negotiate reci? procity treaties with several foreign na t ons. There is only foreign country that would now rtrake such a treaty wiih the United States?Canada?but though it has just proposed such a treaty, they have rejected it peremptorily. Mr. McKlNLEY says he is in favor of the civil service reform law, but that he will not hesitate to decrease or increase the exempted class as he shall deem proper. This means, of course, that all the republicans in office will be re tained and as many more be appointed as places can be made for. The faith of the President in the Dingley high tariff bill is strong iodetd for though, under that bill, the deficit in revenue is increasing at the rate of nine or ten million a month, he bays he U assured of its wisdom. Optimism is great, and Mr. McKinley is its prophet. 

FROM WASHINGTON. [Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette.] Washington.

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Washington, Deo. 6.?President McKinley to day sept his annual mes? sage to Congress. He congratulates it upon assembling under felicitous con? ditions. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue un? broken, he says, and we should feel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unifica? tion in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice. Beginning with the subject of the fi? nances the President says that while the fuil effect of tbe legislation of the extra session has not yet been realized what it has already accomplished as? sures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be required and the people, satisfied with its operation and results thus far, are iu no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. The next question pressing for consideration is that of the currency. With tbe great resources of the government and with the horrible example of the past before us. we ought uot to hesitate to eoter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligation less onerous to the govern? ment and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The evil of the present svstem is found in the great cost to the government of maintain? ing at parity with gold our different forms of mouey and the experience of the pa-it four years has demonstrated that this is not only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menace to the national cred? it. It is manifest that me must devise some plan to protect the government auainst bond issues for repeated re dempt'ons. We have nine hundred mil? lions of currency which tho government by solemn enactment has undertaken to ke'ip at par and nobody is obliged to redeem in gold t ut the government, which must borrow the gold. The law which requires the payment out of the Treasury of redeemed Uuited States notes demands a constant replenish ment of the gold reserve, especially in times of panic and insufficient revenue and durit g tho preceding administra? tion $262,315,400 4i per cent. bonds were issued and sold tosustain the gold reserve and pay the expenses of the government in excess of revenue. While iL is true that a greater part of this is used to supply deficient reve? nues, a considerable portion was re? quired to maintaiu the gold reserve. If no further legislation is to be had, to correct this, and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treas? ury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of ia terest than is now authorized by law. The President says: "1 earnestly recom? mend as soon as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of tho government that when any United State* notes are pre? sented for redemption io gold and are redeemed in gold, such note3 shall be Kept aud set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvi? ous duty. If the holder of the Uaitec States note prefers the gold and gets it Irom tbe government he should not re? ceive back from the government a Unit? ed States note without payiDg gold iu exchange for it," Tnat amounts, in the President's mind, to giviDg an in terest-beariDg debt, a government bond, for a uon-iuterest bearing debt, a United States note. The govern meat should be relieved from the bur deu of providing all the gold required for exchanges and exports. This ought to be stopped. With an era of pros? perity and sufficient receipts we may feel no immediate embarrrassment, but the d inger will be ever present. Tbe President invites careful consid? eration for the detail plan of the Secre? tary of the Treasury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs with bim in the recommendation that national bunks bo allowed to issue notes to the fact value of their bonds deposited; that the circulating tax be reduced to one-hali of one per cent., and that national banks mav be es'ublished with a cap? ital of $25,000. He also recommends that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards, and that they be required to redeem their notes in gold. Turning to foreign affairs the Presi deut devotes much space in his mes? sage to a consideration of the Cuban question, which he says i3 the most im portaot problem with which our gov? ernment is now called upon to deal in its foreign relations. Summarizing the history of former outbreaks, the President comes down to the present insurrection, speakiog of its remark? able increase, its tenacious existence against enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property and the disregard of the civil ized code of war on both sides. He says these conditions give rise to ap? prehensions. There is no desire on our part to profit by Spain's misfortunes and we have only the desire to see tbe Cubans enjoying that measure of self control which is the inalienable right of man. Of the concentration policy of Weyler he says ; "It has utterly /ailed as a war measure. It is not civilized warfare ?it is extermination." Against this abuse of the rights of war tbe President says he has felt con? strained on repeated occasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this government. He outlines his instruc? tions to Minister Woodford which were in substance to impress upon the Span? ish government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reacbiog a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable to Spain and to the Cuban people. It was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make proposals for settlement and it was said that he could not contemplate an indefinite neriod for the accomplish? ment of this result. The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford was, in the President's opinion, in the direction of a better understanding. It admitted our friendly purposes and deep interest and declared that the new government was bound to a change of policy that should sa'isfy the United Slates and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end po? litical reforms will be put into '. effect and military operations con? ducted on humane lines. It. was suggested that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms while the United States for its part should enforce neu? tral obligations and cut off the assist? ance which the insurgents, it was as? serted, received from this country. Early and complete pacification is hop? ed for. The President declares that the Span? ish disposition to charge U3 with failure to meet international duties is baseless and points to the efforts this govern SmalL. pill, safe pill, best pill. DeWitts' ! Littlo Early Bisers cure biliousness, constipa? tion, sick headache. Charlos Q. Lonnon, f raent hos made at the cost of millions ! and by the employment of tbe adminis? trative machinery of tho nation to per I form its full duty. He also says that ? the fact that no military expedition or j armed vessel has left our shores hss been diplomatically represented with Spain. Promising that throughout all the horrors and damages to our own peace tbe United States has never abro? gated its right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the President points out that of untried measures there remain only : Recognition of the insurgents as beliigerents, recognition of the inde pence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end tbe war by imposing a rational compromise botween the contestants, an intervention in favor of one or the other party. He says : "I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cunuot be thought of. That by our code ol mo? rality would be criminal aggression." Taking up tbe question of belligerency, the President quotes at length from" President Grant's message of December 7, 1875, wherein he declared that tho conditions in Cuba warranted neither the recognition of independence nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds that moreover a recognition of belligerency would confer upon neither party to the conflict a status not there? tofore actually possessed, while it would weigh heavily in Spain's behalf, giving her the ri^ht of search on the high seas and extending her maritime rights to the margin of our territorial waters. "For these reasons," says tbe President, "I regard the recognition of the belliger? ency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and therefore inadmissable. Should that sten hereafter be deemed wise, as a matter of riuht and duty, tbe executive will take it." He points to the hopeful change in the Spanish policy to the pledge of reform and to ?.he abatement ol the horrors of w ar as reasons against intervention on hu? manitarian grounds. The first acts of the new government lie in the honor? able paths it has outlined; the policy of rapine and extermination has been reversed ; broad clemencies proflered; measures have been taken to relieve the horrors of starvation. Tbe power of the Spanish armies it is asserted is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation but to protect: the resumption of agri? cultural industries. The President sketches the autonomy scheme of the Spanish government and says that it is nonestly due to Spaiu'that she should' be given u reasonable chance to reulizr her expectations and to prove the as? serted efficacy cf the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed. He points to the many con ces.-ious already made, to the modifica? tion of the horrible order of concentra? tion, to the release of tho Compe itoi i prisoners and the fact that not a single American citizen is now under arrest in Cubs. He says the near future will demon s'.rate whether a righteous peace is like? ly to be attained, if not, the exigency of further aud other action by the United States will remain to be taken. Sure of the right, the government will continue its watchful care over Ameri? can citizens aud its efforts to bring -itiout honorable peace aud, says th President, "If it shall hereafter appear :u be a duty imposed-by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and human? ity ti intervene with force, it shall be .vitbout fault on our part and only be? cause the necessity for such action will '>e 8) clear as to command the support and approval of the civilised world." The President next lake3 up the sub? ject of the uiinexation of Hawaii which, he says, should be accomplished. Rap? idly reviewing Lis former arguments in favor of annexation, he says that legis? lation is required in the event of the ratification ol the treaty and, while ab? rupt assimilations of immature elements of population should be avoided, just provision should be made for self rule in local matters with the largest politi? cal liberty to the Hawaiians. He says that the dispute between Japan and Hawaii over the immigration question is now in a satisfactory stage ot settle ment by negotiation; that our govern ment has not intervened and that ic is learned that Japan is now confident in ;he intention of this- government to deal with all possible ulterior questions ufiecting her interests in the broadest spirit ot friendliness. Reference is made to the failure ol Mr. Merry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on account of the obligations of that country to the Diet of the Great? er Republic of Central America. As there is no legal authority at present to accredit him to the Diet, Mr. Baker, the present minister at Managua, has been directed to present his letters of recall. Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter is said to be likewise accredited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Republic, and his case is awaiting aciion. The Nicaragua Canal is spokeu of as of large importance to our country and the promise is made of further refer? ence to the subject when the report of the commission now at work is sent to Congress. The President says of the interna? tional monetary commission that, not? withstanding diligent effort the envoys have failed so far to secure an agree? ment. Gratification is expressed at the action of France in this matter in join? ing in our efforts and it is said that the negotiations are still pending. Mean? while the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the doubts raised in certain quarters respecting the feasibility of maintaining parity be? tween gold and silver may yet be solved. The President earnestly hopes that their labors may bring about an international agreement. Mr. Kasson, of Iowa, is said to be now conducting negotiations with several governments for reciprocity arrange ments under the taril! act and it is believed that by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by the act, some grievances of our own and other coun? tries in our mutual trade relations may be removed or alleviated and the volume of our commercial eichanges e.-larged. The President earnestly urges the improvement of our mer cbant marine, the inferiority of which, he says, is humiliating to the national pride. Reference is made to the recent con j ference at Washington on the subject of the protection of seal life, the result of which places beyond controversy,it is said, the duty of the governments con? cerned to adopt measures without de? lay for the preservation of the herds. Negotiations to this end are now in progress. International arbitration is declared by the President to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world and trea'.ies embodying these humane prin? ciples on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or honor will have his constant encouragement. A liberal appropriation is bespoken Vou can't cure consumption but you can avoid it and cure overy other form of threat or lung trouble by the use of One Minute Coueh Cure, Charles G. Lennon, in order that the Uoited States may make a creditable exhibit at the ap? proaching Paris exposition, in which the people have shown an unprecedent? ed interest. Under the head of the navy tbe Pres? ident points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure the armor for the three battleships now building which would be otherwise useless. He speaks in terms of praise of the quality of our ships and thinks lhat the time has now arrived when the increase to which tbe country is committed should for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels. He refers to the lack of docks and urges that three or four of the largest docks be provided on tbe Atlantic, at least one on the P:tr;fio coast and a floating dork in the gulf. There should also be a.:;;.?!?? provision for munitions of war aud uu increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards and, as there are now on the stocks five large battleships, it is recommended that an appropriation be made but for one more battleship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo boats are also necessary. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for surveys and for the establishment of another land office at some point in the Yukon Valley, for which an appropriation is asked. Military force is also necessary aod the establishment of some sort of flexible government. If the startling reports as to tbe probable shortage of food for the miners be fully vetified every eflort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of af? fairs in the Indian Territory. The large white element is said to be with? out protection and without schools or other rights of citizens: leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of lands and created an aristocracy and the friends of the Iudians believe that the best in? terests of the five civilized tribes would be found in American citizenship. Reference is made to the failure so far of the Dawes Commission to secure the consent of the tribes to an extin? guishment of tbe tribal titles and a division of the lands. It is said tba? should the tribes still fail to ratify the agreement then some legislation should be had by Congress, The President approves the reccm mendation of the Secretary of the Treasury for an extension of the quar? antine laws, and also EUg^fSts the ap? pointment of a spcc;al commission to ascertain the cause of yellow fever. Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas Pacific Railroad, it is said thit if no better bid is received than the up? set price fixed by the court, tbe government would receive only $2,000,000 on its claim of nearly ?13,000,000. De believes that the government has lbs authority to bid on the road and has directed the Secretary of the Treasury to make tbe drposit of $900,000 required to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the principal of tbe d=bt to the government. He suggests, however, that in a matter so important a-< the government becoming a possible cvner of the railroad, Congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It i3 clear to him, however, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one hfi.lf tho principal of its debt j, id less than one fifth of its entire debt ?principal and interest. Tho President devotes the last chapter of his message to the civil service, the practical im? provement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discus? sion, and which has of late years re? ceived increased legislative and execu? tive approval. During the past few months the service his been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reics'a'ement has been asserted, dis? missals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded against, the ex? aminations improved aud made practi? cal, and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dis missal upon all cases where iucompe tency is charged or demand made for the removal of offic ials. This last has been done without impairing the power of removal?one of the vital safeguards of the system. Much remains to be doue before the system can be perfect? ed, and the President says that be shall not hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly included in the classified service or include those which in his judgment will best pro? mote tho public service. The sfBtem has the approval o( the people, and it will be his endeavor to uphold and ex? tend it. In conclusion the President admon? ishes Congress not to encourage the in? crease of the estimates for the mainte? nance of the government. They would admit of decrease in many branches, and it is a commanding duly to keep the appropriations within the receipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit. THE 

LEGISLATURE. Prayer was offered in both branches of the Legislature on Saturday for Prcsi dent McKinley, in tbe time of his great tfHiction and anxiety, by Dr. Garlick in the Senate and Dr. Hope in the House. Resolutions were offered in both the Senate and House and adopted in the latter providing for a committee to look into the feasibility abolishing the office of Second Auditor, and steps were taken to secure infor? mation, which will be useful in consid? ering various schemes looking to re? forms. SENATE. The Senate received the joint reso? lution adopted by the House providing for the appointment of committees on retrenchment and constitutional amend* mehts and reported them to commii tees. One of these resolutions provides for a special joint committee to re? commend retrenchment legislation, another for a committee to investigate and report how criminal expenses may be reduced, the third for a committee on reduction of the expenses of the State, and the fourth for a committee on constitutional amendments. Among the bills introduced wert: To require clubs and corporations to obtain license to sell, dispense, dis? tribute, or give away wines or iiquors of any kind; to amend an act to make husband and wife competent witnesses for or against each other in civil cases; to authorize the sale of an estate, real or personal, given by deed or will to a person for life with a Vested remainder to another, whether the vested remaind? er man be an infantor an adult; to allow One Minute Cough Cure cures quickly That's what you want', Charles G, Lennon. correction of assessment in cases where I fand is asses ei to the proper owner, I and at the same time the same land is I assessed to another person at any time ! after the discovery of such erroneous assessment; for the deposit of State funds in certain cases; to abolish the board of agriculture. A supplementary bill provides that the duties of the board be discharged by the board of control of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, at Blacksburg. The bill empowers the board of con? trol to employ an additional chemist at a salary not to exceed $1,000 annually. It has been suggested that another measure may be offered, abolishing the office of commissioner of agricul? ture. The bill for the repeal of the law pre? venting the killing of partridges in the Slate, was passed. The bill, as amend? ed, excepts a number of counties, in which the present law remains in force. Tbe clerk read the following tele gran,: Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. "I pray you present my heartfelt gratitude to my democratic brethren of the General Assembly for the renewed and signal expression of their confi? dence implied by my nomination to succeed myself in the United States Senate. That honor gathers its great? est charm in the generous manner it has been bestowed, and renewing to all who tender it and to our beloved Commonwealth the pledges of my de? votion, I accept it with the highest in? spiration to faithful endeavor. "John W. Daniel." The telegram was read in both bouses. The election of Maj. Daniel will take place to morrow and it is expected that he will address the legislature. He did this wheu elected six years ago. house. The passage by the nouse of tbe bill requiring corporations to pay the origi? nal fee at every extension or renewal of charter was accomplished, after con t-iderable debate, and will probably re? ceive some strong opposition in the Senate. Mr. Gallaher offered a resolution looking to so amending tbe constitu? tion a< to do away with the May elec? tions and elect district officers in No? vember. Mr. Winhorne cilered a resolutio which was adopted, the object of which was to ascertain the salaries now being paid by the various counties and cities of the Commonwealth to County Court and Corporation Court judges, and to Commonweath attorneys. He thought many of these officers had not been faithful in the discharge of their duties. If the counties and cities were made to pay their own criminal expenses, these officers would then, being under tbe eye of those who bad an interest in see? ing that the expenses were cut down, make the charges more in accordance with what they should be. A sugges tion was also made that if counties and cities are made to pay their own crim? inal expenses, these expenses might be much less. After debate the consideration cf the Senate bill providing for tbe relief of innocent purchasers of delinquent lands was postponed until to day. A bill was introduced to regulate the size of barrels used for shipment of agricultural products, commonly called truck. A resolution was introduced direct? ing the attorney general to procure at once copies of the official bonds of e 11 county and city treasurers and clerks of courts, and if any defec'.s or inac curacies be found to exist, he shall take such immediate steps as may be necessary to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. 

VIRGINIA NEWS. Mr. Frank S. Fi'zhugh and Miss Ida Grigsby were married on Wednesday evening at tbe Baptist parsonage near Shiloh, King George county. ^ The succession of Major Helms to Superintendent Lynn, of the peniten tiaiy, means a pretty e'ean sweep of the subordinate officials of that institu? tion. Tra houses in Rockettp, Newport News, were burned to the ground yes terday ufternoon by a fire which started in a small shanty, loss $15,000. Two lives are reported lost.
