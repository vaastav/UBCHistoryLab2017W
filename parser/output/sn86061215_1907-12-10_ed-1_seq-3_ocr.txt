The sphinx-like organization of capital, whose heads have been the butt of constant attacks since Ida Tarbell, the first to enter the virgin field of muck-rakedom, pointed out a way for a new generation of reform ers, has spoken. And not only this, but its vice president, John D. Arch bold, expresses the belief that the policy of silence, so long maintained, was a mistaken one, which, if earlier abandoned, would have saved tne cdtnpany from the injurious effect of much of what he terms that misrepre sentation.- In the current number of the Satur day Evening Post, Vice President Archbold takes up the charges, one by one, and states the company's po sition in answering them. First tak ing up the charges that the company has used unfair methods in stifling competition he says: The company contends that its fighting has been fair fighting, and that it has Invariably kept its agree ments and manifested good faith to friend and foe that, while admitting that it is a business organization and hot a benevolent institution, its pol icy toward its rivals would compare most favorably—alike from the stand point of equity and liberality--with the usages of the business world or the records of human history. Those whose lives have been spent in the Industrial arena have learned the impressive lesson that commerce is a struggle. The company claims that its commercial efforts have been fairly made and its commercial vic tories fairly won that Its profits have been the legitimate reward of its in dustry and enterprise and realized 'n the face of continuous competitive conditions the world over. It con fesses Itself unable to anticipate the altruistic trade policies and relation ships of an Arcadia, and cannot In its ramified operations always find It pos sible to follow the mild pathway^ suggested by others for Its guidance. The charge of an uncharitable atti tude toward business rivals is no nov elty In commercial history—and has been as persistently urged against the small competitive retailer as against the largest wholesaler. It *was the demoralized condition of the business, Mr. Archbold asserts, that not only originally invited but almost necessitated the union of brains and capital which rescued the industry from disaster .and gradually evolved the Standard Oil company. 'This has been the sequel, says Mr. Archbold, gauged from the standpoint of the greatest good to the greatest number: Seventy-fiVte thousand miles of pipe line penetrates the various producing territories of the countrygiving the army of producers a regular cash out let for their crude oil whenever and wherever produced, and almost Invari ably at remunerative figures. Many a fortune and many a competency in the oil regions has been traceable thereto. Through great foreign companies which it has created, and through many foreign branches which it has established, tlie company has admin istered and sustained the export com­ merce of American petroleum upon the industrial battle grounds of the world. Through the construction and con trol of a great fleet It has very ma terially economized the delivery of its products to even the most distart markets. Hundreds of millions of foreign gold have been required to pay for its exports (all manufactured in the bnited States), and not only yielding great and legitimate advantage to the company and to the American laborer and to the American producer, but also constituting a highly-important factor in the favorable adjustment of the trade balances of the nation with Other countries. It has been a source of pride and satisfaction that the company has brought this great American product within the reach of the scantiest purse that it has forced It into nearly every niche dnd corner of the civil ized and uncivilized world, promoting among the poorest classes of many countries a host of evening occupa tions—industrial, educational and recreative --not feasible prior to its .introduction. The company has aimed to secure the contentment of its employes by liberal and considerate treatment al lied with a pension system, assuring a competency for waning years. About 65,000 employes are or may be come eligible for this pension, an 1 no less than 500,000 men, women anl children are directly or indirectly in terested in the preservation of the company. As to the charges of rebating Mr. Archbold asserts that before the passage of the interstate cojimerce •act all wholecule concerns bargained for tl elr transport*'c*i as they bar gftiuad for their nvrchandiso. Since the passage of that lie says, the Standard has not received lallroad rebates on Its inLurs'.itj oil ship ments. Mr. Archbold's replv on behalf of the company to the attacks nade up on It is an interesting document, no matter in what light it is viewed." It shows that after all the group of men who control the Standard Oil com pany are human like the rest of us. as susceptible to praise and ns vulner able to the shafts of criticism. And the company's new position will add zest to the merry thrust3 of the followers of Ida Tarbell. as ihey will expect in future to find a foe worthy of their pens, Inviting attack and fighting back, rather than a mere target, absorbing the shafts fired at it without a murmur, or a timid victim sca.mpering to cover like a scared jack rabbit whenever a hunter, arm ed with a muck rake, appears on the scene. A 

FATAL YEAR IN THE MINES. The disastrous explosion in the West Virginia coal mine yesterday in which hundreds of workers lost their lives calls attention to the unusual list of mine fatalities during the yoar 1907. The total of deaths this year, Increased by the latest tragedy, will approximate 2,000, while last year, when more than 1,200 men were kill ed in one accident at Covjxrieres, France, the deaths totalled only 1,600. The Chicago Tribune gives the fol lowing list of mining accidents and the lives each cost since January, 1907: Number Date. Place. of deaths Jan. 14—Clinton, Ind. 8 Jan. 23—Primero, Colo 20 Jan. 24—Florentz, W. Va 11 Jan. 28—Staarbucken, Germany..148 Jan. 29—Stuart, W. Va 91 Feb. 4—Elkins, W. Va 33 t'eb.

France 7 Dec. 1—Fayette City. Pa 30 From this grewsome list it would not seem that safety appliances in the mines have kept pace with the 'n crease in the number of miners em ployed. That there are a few things the law cannot do is pointed out in the President's message when he says: No legislation can bv any possibil ity guarantee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than it can guarantge an individual against the results of his extravagance. When an individual mortgages niB house to buy an auto mobile he invites disaster and when wealthy men, or men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or fool ishly eager t.o become such indulge in reckless speculation—especially If It is accompanied by dishonesty— they jeopardize not only their own future but the future of all their in nocent fellow-citizens, for they ex pose the whole business community to panic and distress. It is not more laws, but a more general observance of the golden rule that is needed. NO MR. 

LAWSCN TO REFORM IViORE. Thomas W. Lawson,, whose spec tacular and clownish reiorm stunts have amused that portion of the pub lic which ey have aot bled, is out with a statement in which he says he is through with reforming. He has perl 3Cted arrangements, he says, by which he will have control of the next election of Amalgamated and wil] elect a new board of directors with himself as president. He shall th«n, he asserts, resign from control In favor of certain internationally known Boston men of corporation af fairs. Byt that is not in the Inter esting position of Mr. Lawson'3 statement. That is found in the clos ing paragraph of hi3 statement with the postscript added: "Also I n«iV3 devoted three and a -fi 5? 4 iialf years of my time and some mil lions of my fortune to reform work In the interests o, tne public. Be ginning Jan. 1 I shall allow the pub lic to do their own reform.ng. I shall devote my time and capital exclu sively to my own business—stock 'gambling' in Wall and State' streets, particularly Wall street, for the pur pose of recouping the millions I have donated to my public work. "P. S.—One of the oldest human laws and immutable is, 'The devil take the hindmost.'" It has been the general belief that Lawson, while guised in the robe of public benefactor and friend )C the dear "peepul" has been devoting his time pretty much in the past to his own business—stock "gambling,' but it will lot be believed, however, t-at there is much need for him vo devote his time in the future to "re couping the millions" he has "do nated" In his "public work." A spectacular figure leaves the lime light when ivir. Lawson makes liis exit. A figure that has been one of the amusements of the decade. But It is perhaps well tnat it is so. There are some people whose sense of humor is not sufficiently keen to fol low the curves in the Lawsonian character, and it will be easier for them, with Lawson away, to keep the family savings account intact. A Chicago woman In listing roan's activities and virtues, says: He is the one who Is not afraid of the dark. He is the one who does not shiver about going to the door at night. He is the one who holds the umbrel la over us when it rains. He is the one who takes us by thv elbow at a crowded street crossing. And, Incidentally, he is also the bread-winner. "Country girls are the only ones that the average young man can af ford to marry. The city girl is too extravagant." This was the declara tion of a lecturer speaking at a meet ing of a Chicago woman's club. It is probable that the future social events in the country may be graced by some of them "durned city dudes" seeking to follow the Chicago man's advice Bill Nye's Cow. Bill Nye, the humorist, once had a cow to sell and advertised her follows: "Owing t0 my ill health I will sell at my residence, in township 19, range 18, according to the government's sur vey, one plush rasberry cow aged 8 years. She is of undoubted courage and gives milk frequently. To a man who does not fear death in any form she would be a great boon. She is very much attached to her present home with a stay chn.in, but she will be sold to anyonu vho will agree to treat her right. Slie is one-fourth Shorthorn and throe-quarters hyena. I will throw in a double barrel shot gun, which goes with her. In May she usuallly goes away for a weok or two and returns with a tall red calf with wabbly legs. Her name is Rose. I would rather sell to a nonresident. 

FORECAST FOR DECEMBER. Blakesburg Excelsior. December was the last month of the year. When Julius Caesar became big stick of the Roman empire, the month contained but 29 days. He added two more one to make ready for Christmas and another to recover from it. Christmas gifts originated with the Greeks and Santa Claus was originated by the toy manufacturers of Germany, where the Teddy Bpars came from. The motto for the month will be "Shut the Door!" Roosevelt and Bryan will be the leading presidential candidates and prohibition will continue the burning Issue. The 21st will be the shortest day in the year. This will be on Saturday, and if you are at church the next day and stay for the sermon you will notice that the 22d is much longer. The moon will be full on the 19th and some of the boys will be full until after the holidays the sign of the zodiac for the month will be Cap ricornus. the Goat. This will make butter go up (to John Foland's de light and all the kids will go to Sun day school in order to get a mosquito bar sock full of candy. The old mill pond will freeze again, And every one will skate. And mollycoddle, modest swain, Will go forth with his mate She'd slip In such a way that she Will see a brilliant star. And he will deeply blush to see How long her stockings are. The money scare will quiet down— nphappy circumstance and money will frequent again the pockets of our pants. The new gold coins they're making now' without "In God We Trust" will turn up in the hat at church as prized as any dust. The scrip we have will be retired and real dough will look good, and no subscrib ers will insist on paying us with wood. The sleigh will jingle up the road the lines around the whiD ,and George and Nellie, in the robes, will love's own honey sip. The sleigh will hit a ten-foot bank, and they'll go rolling down, with Nellie's feet in George's face and walk six miles to town. The new rules for farmers, promul gated by the Farmhands' Union, will go Into effect on the 1st, viz: Farmers will provide automobiles for all help, and will serve as chauffeurs they will eat at the second table and sleep in the hayloft they will rise at 4. do the chores and serve breakfast to the hands In bed at 9 they will- provide a phonograph and the current maga zines hands will supervise the farm work from 11 to 1? and from 2 to 3 the earnings of the farm will be placed in a bucket every Saturday and pour ed through a ladder placed horizon tally, with the ends In two chairs what goes through, the hands, get and what sticks on the rungs goes to the farmer.

Here is an advertisement from an old copy of an English provincial journal: "Wanted, for *i sober family, a man of light weignr., who fears ihe Lord and can driv,? a ualr of horses. He must occasionally wait at table, join the household prayer, look after the horses and reo,l a chapter of the Bible.

Wages, 15 guineas a year." TWO ODD ADVERTISEMENTS. Col. Henry Watterson in an address to a convention of journalists ,to'.d the story of a very odd advertisement that was printed in the London Times. The ad ran something like this: VA young gentleman who is on the point of getting married is most desirous of meeting a man of experience, who will take the responsibility of dis suading him from the dangerous step." AN ODD ADVERTISEMENT. This advertisement appeared re cently in a Glasgow paper: "Found wandering in Castle street, on Satyr day evening, 28th ulto., a child, about 3 years, healthy looking, dark hair, gray eyes and ruddy cheeks, able to talk a Uttle ard swear." SIDELIGHTS. The ways of the persevering lover are not always strewn with roses, nor is his path ever {.he easy and Inviting one, what lovelorn youth may say to the contrary notwithstanding. That the above is true may be easily learned by anyone if he will but sit up and take notice without playing a hand in the game of hearts and note the effect of late and repeated calling of gallants upon their sweethearts, of balls, theatres, parties, etc.. that go to make the round of,duty that falls to the lot of the average Romeo who would do honor to a Juliet. While many, perhaps, escape much of the real martyrdom to. which so large a number of lovers fall heir to, the subject'of this sketch Is amply justified in being the boss of his fire side when the day on- which they plight their vows will have become a thing of the past. He is engaged in a large manufac turing plant in the Lowell of the west and is a skilled workman. He holds a responsible position aijd may be found at any time during working hours at his post where he faithfully and zealously strives to advance i,n position and salary to such an emi nence that he may, at some not far distant day, furnish the house for two. She does not live In the same city as her, Romeo, but in a nearby town, and he frequently1 takes .a trip' to .the rural districe to see the object of his affections, to partake of Sunday: din ner and supper and compliment her on the excellence of her ,, culinary achievements. On a recent trip to the home of his bride elect, this young man thought he would use his wheel, and, starting early on a, Sunday morning not long ago, he arrived ln safety .at her home where, as usual, an appetizing and in viting dinner was awaiting his com ing, as was also the young lady. The day passed very pleasantly and as night approached the anticipation of the next day, with its continual grind of work and, the thought of the dis tance he must cover before reaching his home, made him hasten his leavetaking, if such a thing is possi ble to'the ardent lovers. It was about 10 o'clock when the adieus were made and the young man getting astride of his wheel, started on his homeward trip, hitting the high places in the-road with a vim and vigor that would enable him to reach his sleeping quarters in time to change his attire and snatch forty winks before beginning his dally work on the following day. All went well for a few miles, as the night was one of those beautiful nights of last month, when the moon was very kind and considerate to Mother Earth, and shed her rays in silvery splendor along the pathway of the lonely cyclist, whose thoughts were a mixture of the late farewell taken and the anticipation of what the morrow would bring forth after a day so crowded with happy events. When, he had reached a point some nine miles from his home an unfortu ate action, as delay would but make broke. The scene immediately chang ed— ,tbe beauty of the silvery moon, the Impressive' quiet of the woodland, even the blissful* recollections of the day just passed were lost sight of by the lonely traveler. He was no longer the ardent lover, but just plain man, with a proposition staring him in the face and one that called' for immedi ate astion. as delay would bit make matters worse. Nine miles from home, alone on a country road with a broken bicycle to propel, was the situation that faced the wanderer.. The clock was on the stroke of.-, three as he tucked the bed-covering about him and as the shrill blast from a nearby factory whistle ronsed Kim from his slumbers, he resolved toJieep it fro mthe boys at work I wonder if he did?

"Rough Riders" love of federal of fice holding Is a standing joke in offi cial circles here. The President sel dom passes up an opportunity of tak ing care of a man who served In his regiment during the war with Spain by giving him a federal appointment. At a recent White House dinner where Henry Cabot Lodge, senior senatof- from Massachusetts and close friend of Mr. Roosevelt, was a guest, the President was telling of some of his war time experiences in the course of which he alluded to a New Eng lander who was an officer in the "Rough Riders." "What Is that fellow doing now, Cabot?" said the President, turning to Mr. Lodge. "One of two things," replied the senator without a smile. "The only Rough Riders who are not holding public office today are those who are in jail." Taft a Story Teller. It is an infrequent meeting when Secretary Taft does not contribute a good story for the President and his official family as a sort of appetizer to the more serious work of the ses sion. One day last spring the tary of war came into tne room a few minutes late and to the surprise of all his genial "good morning" came in a whisper. He was suffering with a severe cold. "What are you doing here with a cold like that?" asked the President reproachfully. "That reminds me," said Mr. Taft— and the President and his cabinet for got about his afflictions and settled themselves back in their chairs for the cabinet appetizer. "When I was at Murray Bay sev eral summers ago I met Lord Justice Fitzglbbon, who was one of the jus tices of appeal of Ireland. He told me this story: He said he was holding the assizes in Tlpperary county in Ireland when a man was brought be fore him on an indictment for man slaughter. The case was proven that the deceased came to his death by being hit with a stick in the hands of the defendant, but the doctor testified that be had what in medical parlance was called a 'paper skull.' When the Jury returned the verdict of guilty, and when the man was brought be fore th© court for sentence, his Lord ship asked him whether he had any thing to say why sentence of the court should not be pronounced upon him.
