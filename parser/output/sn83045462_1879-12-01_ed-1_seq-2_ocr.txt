THE EVENING STAR. WASHINGTON. KONSDAY ............. December 1, 18, CROSBY S. NOYES .... Editor. Aversae DmUi Cieulation over 17.750 beinO a M101c larger boas jlde, regular and 9ermanet circulation than that of all the other daily Wapers in taO ceit added together. Tnu STAR is connected with the wires of the Na tional Telephone Exchange and with the Western Union Telephone Exchange. Both these agencies can therefore be availed of in sending to THE STAR advertisemnents, orders for the paper to i served, news, or any information, at any h ur o' the day free of charge. These facilities are a . rest -onve nience, and will be appreciated by the cm torn re of Twa SraR. The M~essaage. The annual message of President Hayes, laid before Congress to-day, is a creditable state paper, and is noticeably devoid of anything of a partisan nature. He makes the resumption of Specie payments and the consequent prosperity the first subject and recommends additional financial legislation, the most important feature of which is that the U. S. legal tender notes be retired. He advises more stringent laws for the Suppression of polygamy, and earnestly appeals for entire and complete protection of the right of suffrage In all sections of the country. Our relations with foreign countries, the barder raids, timber depredations, the condition of Alaska and all the governmental departments and interests are treated of, and the condition and needs of each placed before Congress for proper attention. The President gives his views at some length upon civil ser vice reform, maintaining the position he took in the early days of his administration against permitting officers of the government to take an active part in the control and management of politics. The Pres ident is especially thoughtful of the interests of the District of Columbia. He transmits to Con gress the report of the District Commissioners and Invites particular attention to the re3om mendations contained therein. He particflarly impresses upon Congrers the necessity of legis lation for 4he reclamation of the Potomac marshes. He also urges favorable action in be half of the public schools of the District and reminds Congress that "the terri tory of this District is the common prop erty of the people of the United States, who equally with Its residents are inter ested in tl'e prosperity of the Capitol." Measures thus so earnestly recommended by the Commissloners and by the President ought certainly to receive from Congress the attention they deserve. The Potomac flats have long been an eyesore that detracts in a large degree from the beauty of the capital and offsets much that has been done in the way of improvement. But the greater consideration that demands their reclamation is one of health. Not only do the citizens of the District fall under the baleful effects of the malaria-producing flats, but mem bers of Congress and their families furnish victims, as well as visitors, who in coming to Washington desire to seek health as well as pleasure. During the sessions of Congress the children of members are regular attendants at tne public schools, and therefore the request for assistance from Congress is eminently just. The President in urging Congress to relieve needs of the District which the "means of the Commissioners are wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of " has done an act of justice which Congress can complete and make effect ive by promptly carrying out the recommenda tions. Legal-Tender Notes. The recommendations of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury that the legal tender quality of United States notes be taken Sway, is likely now to cause considerable dis Cu on. This recommendation, however, is no new departure on the part of republican admin 1strations. In 1874 Secretary Bristow recom mended as follows: "That after an early and fixed day United States notes shall cease to be legal tender as to contracts thereafter to b made." In 1875 he repeated his recommenda tion. In 1876 Secretary Morrill, in his annual report, says: "The United States notes, com monly known as legal tender, regarded as a substitute for money, are an anomaly in our monetary system, tolerable and possible only in the exigencies of a civil war-the offspring of its perils and limited to its necessitles. - To allow their continuance as such after the cause which justified their existence had ceased, is to violate the conditions of their inception, and to sanction what was only tolerable as a necessity, by impressing upon it the stamp of legitimacy. * * * The quality of legal tender with which they were Impressed should have been co-exist ent only with the necessities of which they were the offspring. Having served their end, they existed properly only as evidence of govern ment Indebtedness, to be provided for as other debt obligations." In the same year President Grant recommended to the earnest considera tion of Congress: "A repeal of so much of the legal-iender act as makes these notes receiv able for debts contracted after a date to be fixed In the act itself, say not later than the 1st of January, 1877;" which Is substantially the re commendation of Secretary Sherman. ..STINE.ETz, 128y Pnns leru sa aenue.

At a meeting of the Board of Directors, Voted: That in view of the verdict of the U. S. Supreme Court dissolving the injunction restraining the Company from reselling the best and centraly lo cated stalls in the Market thereby disposing of one more of the expensive and vexatious suits instituted by these dealers against the Market Company, that the same discount for prompt or advanced pay ment (viz. : 20 per cent.) be allowed to all occe ants of stalls and stands, as was allowed for prom pay ment previous to the injunction; provide , how ever, tat this discount shall only be made to the occupants of such stalls or stands as sign contracts accepting monthly tenancy, and pay their rental promptly to the clerk in advance, and also make arrangeinents for the payment of all arrearages due the Company. This vote to go Into effect on and after December 1, 1879, and to continue until otherwise voted by the Directors. Reduced rental for prompt payment on average sized stalls: Per Month. Butchers' Stalls.......................$11.20 Butter Dealers' Stands ................. 5.40 Hucksters' Stands.......................... 4.20 Fish Dealers' Stands....................... 4.80 Miscellaneous Stands ...................... 4.80 The above rates include gas and water rents and policing and cleaning the Market. The original rental fixed by the Governor of the District, when the new Market was ready for occu pancy, and from which the above liberal discount for prompt payment is now allowed by the Market Com pany was 55 per centum lower than the aver rental in the principal Eastern Markets, as will scen by the following extract from the report of Mr. Adolf Cluss, who was employed to investigate the amount of rental charged in other Markets, and report to a committee in Congress: [Extraet from Mr. Cluss' Re rt.] WASHINGTON, D. C., MARKET. Washington Market Com pany. -The floor-space of buildings is 57,50 square feet, which yield an aver age income of $52,000 from rentals, or 90% cents lper square foot offlor space. The butchers pay for a stall of 48 square feet an annual rental of 8168, or $3. 50 per square foot. The butterinerchants pay for a stallof 36 square feet $81, or $2.25 per square foot. The bacon dealers pay $108 p'er stall, or $3 per square foot, and the huck sters pay $63 orIE.75prUareTfot. Annual Income Average per sq. foot rent per of floor-space sq. foot In building. of stall. In Quincy Market (Faneul H~ail Extension) WIktou$1.94 3.23 In Washington Retail Mar ket, New York............ 2.02 3.00 In Central Market, Phila.. 1.19 2.32 In Farmers' Market, Phila. 1.09 3.84 tol1.54 Average of the three East ern cities.................$1.56 $2.95 In Washington Market Compn's buildings,, in Was n...............$0 -90% $1.90 The rtsof the p'rincip'al markets of Eastern cities exceed, therefore, those of Washington city by 55 per centum. The difference between the average Income per square foot of floor-space and the average income p'er square foot of ground occupled by stalls is greater In the case of the Washington Market-Com pany than for any of the other: markets, because, after consultation and with the a 'probation of the tenants, previous to the construcnon of the stalls it w:as decided to throw an unusually large area in the gangways and aisles. The aisles occupy In the city markets of Boston 34 per centunm of total floor space, while In the Washington buildings 53 per centum are given up for public use. In making the comparative statements It has been thought to be most accurate to adopt the occu pled area as the scale. If as Is sometimes done, the number of front feet of the stall would have been taken as the scale, the discrepancy between the dif ferent cities would have been much geter. For instance, a Boston stall foots up $57.6 per front foot, against $28 and $10.50 as the maximum and mininum of annual stall rent In Washingrton. All of which is respectfully submitted. 

ADOLF CLUSS, Architect. In view of the above liberal offer on the prt of the Market Company iis expected that alocca ,'ants of stalls a:' d slands will avail themslves of the 20 per cent. discount by adjusting all arrearages and paying their December rent to me promptly In advance. nov29-2t P. 8.
