Digest of the Annual Message of President McKinley to the Con gress of the United States. 

LARGELY A REVIEW OF THE RECENT WAR. The President Baa Only Words of Praise for Those Who Brought the War to a Successful Conclusion, and Ijooka For ward Conflently to the Conclusion of an Honorable Treaty of Peace with Spain. Washington, Dec. 5. President Mc Kinley's second annual message, sub mitted to congress, contains about 20, 000 words. Following is a brief synop sis including some direct excerpts of the more important features of the message: TO THE 

SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESEN ATI VES : Notwithstanding the adde burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people rejoice in a very sat isfactory and steadily-increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded. Manu factures have been productive, agricul tural pursuits have yielded abundant re turns, labor in all fields of Industry is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present congress has in creased the treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors; the finances of the government have been suc cessfully administered and its credit ad vanced to the first rank; while its cur rency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit, and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal - bonds between every sec tion of the country. 

CONTROVERSY WITH SPAIN RE VIEWED. In reviewing the controversy which led up to the war with Spain, the president takes up the thread or narrative where it terminated in his last annual mes sage. He concluded: "It was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of re form to which she had become irrevoca bly committed." It became evident, however, that the proposed plans were barren of good re sults. No tangible relief was afforded the reconcentrados, among whom the rate of mortality frightfully increased; the proffered expedient of zones of cultiva tion proved illusory, and it was apparent that nothing save the physical exhaus tion of Spain or the Cubans and the prac tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re sult from the struggle then in progress. 

DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINE. At this critical juncture the destruc tion of the battleship "Maine" occurred. Concerning it the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense u-siinguishing our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, al ready deeply touched ny preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an in stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed, by whomso ever wrought." Resuming the war narrative, the presi dent directs attention to the measures, including the $50,000,000 appropriation for national defense, taken to place the country on a war footing, and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war, when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict." 

APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN POWERS. Reference is made to the apprehension of coming strife by the continental pow ers, voiced in the address to the presi dent through their ambassadors and en voys, and to the president's reply thereto. Still animated, however, by the hope of a peaceful solution of the difficulty, and obeying the dictates of duty, tae presi dent relaxed no effort to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne gotiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical results were concerned, and then it was the president presented the question to con gress, saying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests, which give us the right and duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop." THE 

DECLARATION OF CONGRESS. The result of this statement of the case was tne adoption of the memorable joint resolution by congress, declaring the pur pose of the United States to intervene between the Spaniards and Cuban. Fol lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the resolution, came the severence of diplo matic relations between the two coun tries, the proclamation of a blockade of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers, and the formal declaration of the existence of a state of war. All other governments were immediately notified of the exist ence of war and each proclaimed neu trality. "It is not among the least grati fying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and difficult circumstances." THE PREPARATION FOR WAR. The president reviews at length the work of preparation for war, referring particularly to the enlistment of the vol unteers, to the material increase of the navy in both men and ships, and to the precautionary measures taken for the protection of the seaboard coast and cities. "The aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors from Maine to California." Referring to "the difficult and im portant character" of the work per formed by the signal corps the president says: "This service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operations of the army and navy. With a total force of over 1,300, the loss was by disease, in camp and field, officers and men included, only five." As to the authorized loan of $200,000,000, which was taken entirely by small bid ders, the president says: "This was a most encouraging and significant result, showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the people to uphold their country's honor." Taking up chronologically the events of the war, the president reviews them care fully. The first encounter was the shell ing of Matanzas on April 27. This was followed by an engagement which was "Destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime warfare." 

DEWEY'S WONDERFUL VICTORY. This was Commodore Dewey's wonder ful victory at Manila, on May 1. "The ef fect of this remarkable victory" says the president, "upon the spirit of our people and upon the fortunes of the war was in stant. A prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms, which continued throughout the struggle." The president says that "Only reluc tance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming and capture of the city (Manila), and therewith the absolute military occupan cy of the whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleship Oregon from San Francisco to Key West, and the bombardment of San Juan and the forts of Santiago, to which special reference is made, the president says: 

LIEUT. HOBSON'S EXPLOIT. "The next act In the war thrilled not alose the hearts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven volunteers, blocked the outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap ing with their lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of he roes was cordially appreciated, by the Spanish admiral." THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN. The campaign of Santiago, resulting in the investment and capture of that city, is referred to as a brilliant achieve ment. A brief review is then presented of the decisive naval combat of the war on July 3, resulting in the complete de struction of Admiral Crevera's fleet. Con cerning it the president says: "Where all bo conspicuously distinguished them selves, from the commanders to the gun ners, and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms, each and all contributing towards the achievement of this astound ing victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event, and the mar velous disproportion of casualties, it would be invidious to single out any one for special honor." 

PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS. In this connection the president says; "Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve ments of our builders, mechanics and ar tisans for their part in the construction f our warships." TEARS FOR THE DEAD. As to the 'success gained by the arms f the United States in Cuba, the presi dent says that the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. "Nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living, the dead claim our tears, and our losses by battle, and disease must cloud any exultation at the result, and teach us th awful cost of war. however, rightful the cause or signal the victory." 

CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. "The total casualties in killed and wounded in the army during the war with Spain were: Officers killed, 23: en listed men killed. 257; total, 2S0; officers wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1 464; total 1.577. Of the navy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as result of wounds, 1; Invalided from service, 6; total, 91. "It will be observed that while our navy was engaged in two great battles and in numerous perilous undertakings in block ade and bombardment, and more than 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands, and were engaged in as sault and siege and battle and manv skirmishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and wounded; and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun, or a flag, or a transport, or a ship, and with the exception of the crew of the "Merrimac". not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner." TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT GO. The president bears testimony and pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de votion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunate ly were not required outside of the United States." They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The president then says: "In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment, and offers humble prayer for the continuance of His favors." THE 

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. The peace negotlatons, which followed soon after the capitulation of Santiago, and the preparation and signing of the protocol, are discussed at length. Refer ring to the work of the peace commis sioners at Paris, the president says: "These negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite treaty before the senate, with a review of the steps leading to its 'signature." 

GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS SESSIONS. "I do not discuss at this time the gov ernment or tenure of the new possesions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, and until the congress has legislated other wise, it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation, and to give to the people security In life and property and encouragement under a just and benefi cent rule. THE FUTURE OF CUBA. "As soon as we are In possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to Its people to form a government for them selves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is im portant that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the industry of the people, and assist them to form a government which shall be free and in dependent, thus realizing the best aspira tions of the Cuban people. A HUMANE GOVERNMENT. "Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent and humane govern ment, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and pro mote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither re venge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued." FRIENDLY WITH ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. The president says that with one ex ception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations during the past year has been marked with cordiali ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar gentine government, initiated with a view to remqving differences in cable rate charges imposed upon messages passing from and to the United States, the presi dent expresses his sincere hope for an in ternational agreement whereby inter change of messages over connecting lines may be regulated on a fair basis of uni formity, and adds: "It would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which owes so much of its progress to the an nihilation of time by the electrical force, demands that this all-important means of communication be a heritage of all peo ples, to be administered and regulated in their common behalf." A 

QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. As to the killing and wounding of strik ing miners in Luzerne county.

NICARAGUA CANAL. The president expects 'that the Nicara gua canal commission will shortly be able to report finally. "I have not hesitated to express my convictions," says the pres ident, "that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an inter oceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter."

It is not to be Inferred that other legis lation relating to our currency is not re quired; on the contrary, there is an ob vious demand for it."
