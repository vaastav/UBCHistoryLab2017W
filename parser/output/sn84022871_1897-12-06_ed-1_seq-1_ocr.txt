MESSAGE' FORECAST. message of President McKinley devoted practically to the I: of our foreign relations and irrency problem. It will be in one respect in that it ignores aat bulk of matters usually uting the departmental por- l presidential annual messages. 3 is scarcely a reference to the matter of the annual reports cabinet, the President's pur ging to call attention only to bre important affairs of the imen. For this reason the savings project of the post general is not discussed in 3sage. 3 the details of the currency re not definitely known, it can oritatively stated that it is in in an incorporation of the views submitted by Secretary Gage, though as to details the President leaves himself freedom of action by not taking any position with reference to several features of the secretary's plan while endorsing its main object. Strong presentation of the Hawaiian question is made and Congress is urged to take immediate action by ratification of the treaty of annexa tion. This part of the message strong y depicts the necessity for making the island part of the domains of the United States and reviews the advan tages that would accrue to the coun try by its possession. As to Cuba, the message calls attention to the recent trend of affairs on the island, refers to the scheme of autonomy just offered by Spain, and, after re citing other developments in the situ ation, reaches a virtual conclusion that existing circumstances do not warrant inteference in the affairs of the island. Considerable attention is'paid to the question of reciprocity negotiations with various nations of Europe. Spec ial Commissioner Kasson has been working on this subject for some time, and the message deals with some of the developments of negotiations already had and expresses the satis factory results in the future. The policy of the Administration on this subject is outlined, and citing French champagnes as an illustration, the point is made that if special conces sions are given any foreign products, the United States must be given equal treatment by reciprocal concessions. The Alaska problem is discussed at some length and a plea is made for congressional legislation including the extension of the operation of the public land laws and the granting of rights of way for roads by which all parts of the country may be made more accessable. 

PROBABLE LEGISLATION. Members of Congress are unusually slow in putting in , their appearance here for the regular session which convenes next Monday. Up to this time there have been scarcely more than a half dozen arrivals each day. From now on, however, it is expected that thejrush. will begin, and that a full attendance will be present on the opening day. Few of the leaders of either house are yet here. This is es pecially true of the House of Repre sentatives. Neither Speaker Reed nor Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the majority, will reach Washington until Saturday or Sunday. With the exception of the pronounced and radical pro and anti Cuban members, the members of both houses, as a rule, seem tojbe holding their judg ment in abeyance until they ascertain from official sources exactly what the situation is as to Cuba. In the matter of currency it seems already estab lished that the democrats and their free silver allies will oppose stub bornly anything the majority is like ly to propose and the fact that the opposition in the Senate seems in surmountable inclines many of the republican members of the House to the opinion that it would ,be wisdom not to attempt any legislation what ever. Mr. Hepburn of Iowa is one of these. He thinks the futility of passing a measure . in the Senate makes it inexpedient for the House to attempt to put through a meas ure, and, besides, he doubts the pro priety of the republicans of tho House attempting to make a republican policy on a subject upon which the republican iplatform . does Jnot speak to the point. He says if the president should, as reported, recommend any scheme for the retirement of greenbacks, it would be beyond the republican platform and every re publican would be free to support or oppose it a3 his judgment indicated. There is some talk of a republican caucus on this question; many of the members believing tif fa currency measure is to be passed differences could bej most easily adjusted and concerted action secured in this way. Mr. Walker of Massachusetts, chair man of the committee on banking and currenc", some time ago sent a letter to every member of his com mittee urging the importance of cur rency legislation and asking each member to be prepared as soon after the opening of the session as possi ble to work to the end that some measure may be submitted to the House for action. Mr. Hepburn, who i3 chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce, says he has re ceived many letters during the re cess, particularly from mercantile bodies, urging action on the anti scalping and pooling bills, and he ex pects both these questions to receive early attention. Secretary Gage said recently that in the annual estimates he would send to Congress he would name about $10,000,000, and not above 25,000,000 as the amount of the treasury deficit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898. The secretary said that he e"x- pected the receipts from customs to increase steadily and that in the spring months he anticipated large importations. 

ANNEXATION OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS. t for it of bank paper, and for a liberal banking law, under which remote communities with small capital can enjoy banking facilities of which they are now deprived. In other words, let the Honse pass the measure that is needed, and perhaps something may be obtained from the Senate if the sound-money men of that body make a determined and intelligent push for it. Harper's Weekly. Royal makes the food pure, wholesome and delicious. Among the important matters with which the United States Senate will have on its hands during the present session of Congress is the question of annexation of the Sandwich Islands. The government of Hawaii has al ready accepted the proposition and a largo proportion of the people seem anxious that the Islands should be annexed. It only remains now for. Senate, by a two-thirds vote in favo? to ratify the treaty. It is reported that more than this number of sena tors are willing to vote for the treaty. The annexation means of course that these far away islands become a part of the United States. They will be entitled to some sort of territorial or other government under the sanc tion of the United States. They will be under the protection of our gov ernment and will be entitled to rights and privileges which belong to states and territories. Hereafter, if not at once, in the very nature of things, complications in regard to rights and privileges, and with other powers are liable to arise. Expenses, probably greater than any direct returns to the government, will be incurred, Forts and fortifications must be built to resist attacks in case of war with other nations. Battle ships must patrol the waters and guard the interests of the far-away regions and the country must pro tect the islands from danger from without, and commotions, if such there may be, from within. It is claimed on the other hand that the islands belong by right of loca tion, though two thousand miles away, to the United States. They are largely controlled already by people who have gone there from this coun try. Their interests are identica witn ours. .Business relations are close. We ship a large variety of products and manufactures there, while they ship tb us immense quan tities of sugar . and other products which are grown on the islands. American capital in large amounts is invested there. It is a question with many, how ever, whether the project is advan tageous or not. Our country and our capabilities are pretty large yet and we have no special need of territory or of distant sea possessions. Euro pean countries, even little Japan of the Asiatic realms, are reaching out for territory and power, and without doubt are ready to accept Hawaii if the United States does not do it. So far our possessions in Alaska have not proved unprofitable and it may be that a portion of the Pacific may be advantageous. We shall see. THE 

PRESIDENT AND THE il ENDLESS CHAIN." It seems to be settled that Mr. Mc Kinley is to make some recognition of the need of money reform in his forth-coming message, and that he is at least to recommend the adoption of Mr. Gage's proposed plan for destroy ing the "endless chain" which has been so successf ully dragging the gold out of the Treasury. Whether or not he is to go any further than this ap pears not to be known. The destruc tion of the "endless chain" is to be accomplished, if Congress agrees to Mr. McKinley's proposal, by prohib iting the reissue of greenbacks except In return for gold. This would be an exceedingly valuable step in the right direction, but so long as the green backs exist they will be a hindrance to the adoption of a sound banking law, and a temptation to unsound money men to agitate for government paper alone. Already the greenbacks are taking advantage of the rumored recommendation to begin an agita tion for the replacement of National bank notes with greenbacks. What the country wants, however, is a system that shall supply all the paper money, leaving to the government the duty of coining metal money, and to the Treasury Department the duty of collecting and disbursing the rev enues, and of holding the securities and the safety -fund for the assurance of bank-notes. We trust that the House which may if Mr. Reed will will pass .a proper bill providing for the retirement and destuction of gov- I ernment paper, for the substitution 1 :1 mm if 0Sllfer 1 Absolutely Pure
