Our- naval . fiicers are accustomed to blows, and pretty severe one's Bome . times, bui they ' Msuilly come" from outside sonrces, It is rarely ever that . they are jen ponsible for them, but a'blow whicjh . has j ost fallen upon AJitiral Porter, is a knot-ty one-if .'no,t a tiauticM ; .onc,it is nevertheless a naughty one, "While eueaeed in attempting the re . ductioa of Fort Fisher, owing to ad verse gales and ..other misfortunes, ' the honest Vice Admiral- forgot his cunning and likewise his dignity, - and wrote a ktter. It is plain the Admiral was not a politician, though they ocassionally do as the admiral did, and write letters Awmcu iucv stand committed. 1 He wrote hi let ter, and woe is he, the letter survived its purpose, and has recently been rxiMm thw.nffh the Kew York jxinu. juiv o ' Hun. - It is not exactly known through whose agency it appeared, but the responsibility is charged up on Ben Butler, who powder ship failure afforded an opportunity for Porter to "blow him up," and now his discovery of . the existence of Porter's letter, has given him a like opportunity. The only question ii- maining.is" one for metaphyBicians.as to the relative power of powder or letters to blow 'the originators sky ward. The result in each case will Drobably determine. Ben, catlike came down feet formost, and alight ed erect, with his neither eye ccked as usual, on the prospects ahead Porter is now in the air, and it ap pears "probable that, like Paddy'" - squirrel, if let alone "the fall will kill him." But he is disposed to soften his fall, as much -. as may be, ' and has consequently written an other letter, in which all personal knowledge of the" former letter is denied, and confession made that, while laboring under excitement, he might have been guilty of such an ebuUtion of temper, although it was nnaccountable, as the sentiment ex pressed were so greatly at variance with the known' feelings of "his na- ' tare, (he had roundly berated Gen eral Grant, and expressed want of confidence in him 4c, which, under the prestige of his subsequent suc cess, it was convenient to forget,) and the oft repeated expressions of his lips. Toor fellow,he makes a bad fist of it, and gives further evidence that he is no politician, or he would not again have committed himself to paper. It would have become his profession better ' to' have . gon trankly to the' President : land ac knowledged, that, while such were his impressions at the time, he had had abundant evidence since that he had misjudged his ability, . , " " It is more likely, however, th at the letter was published to injure Grant, but instead recoiled upon its author. The President was reported to have felt badly about it, and that it would influence his action in pro motions. - But it has not Smother ing any feeling he might lave had ' in l.he premises, he haa subserved the public good, by recognizing the public services of Porter and ad vancing him to the rank of Admiral. In this he has displayed a magna- - nimity seldom witnessed among the magnates of the land, and given a crowning evidence of his eminent fit- ness for the position he occupies. ' It is probable the Admiral will light opon his feet, and that the meUphy- . sicians will be left in a quandary. Railroads. Mb. Editok: The spirit with which yon advocafcstlis con struction of a rail road to Bryan, may justly t termsd "plucky." I like tenacity and pluck, and commend you for a fearless defence of theories which you believe to be true. But there are two sides to the question of -What might have been," and whether a rail road Tunning from Fremont, on a new route west would benefit the city, is, in my judgement Terr doubtful. It would no doubt be a good thine for the country, to have a road on the hne proposed, but that it would impair the growUi aid business of our city, our experince to mil roads c'earlv proves. It would found new towns and build up old ones, furnishing avenues of trade to those who now bring their business here, which would be destructive to our commercial interests. Let one of our citi rens who lived here twenty yean ago visit Clvde, Lindsey, or Elmore, ana he will find fcehind the counters of many .merchantile houses, men who received their business edu cation in the extensive establishment of onr city. Here they also accumulated the means for the commencement of business life, but in stead of bailding upon some of our tine busi ness stresta, and en gaging in- trade, they have taken advantage of the opportunity afforded thera by the construction of a rail road, and gone to points nearer their friends and cus tomers, and there the latter will be found, jsjniuar xaces oi yore, exchanging money and produce for goods which ought tone sold here. ' This fact is not alone peculiar to the merchant, but the mechanic, the manufacturer jjid professional men, withdraw their business and influence to promote the growth of our riv ajal aee no encouragement tothe merchants and owners of real estate in Fremont, to contribute towards building more rail roads, for the fam ine community seems tt be most exclusively the recipient of the fruits of their construc tion; they do not make city property more val uable, except where, in a few instances, more than the usual prices may be obtained for" de MTerounds and a few groceries adjoining, tint being the means of rapid transportation stock, grain and other produce topoints thev are extensively consumed; they contribute more to the prosperity ol tue rarm fnv cms else.

If the people of other towns, and the country along any proposed route, desire u build a rail road making oar river, at this place, its terminus, will provide the money to do it, and will pay us for the land they appro priate, let them do so. I will not object, but would much prefer to see our citizens tax themselves, to raise and emend 1 no (ton which it would cost -us to build the Bryan load, upon the wagon roads leading out of our oity. The development of the commercial interests of our city is most important, and we should not m our anxiety to extend our growth, do inai which will be disastrous to them. The en couragement of manufacturing is well enough but do not rail roads often destroy towns which possess superior advantages in this par ticular? Maumee City has the best water power in Ohio, but the construction of rail roads deprived her ef the county seat, com pletely prostrated her business and established a city ranking third in numerical and oom- Let us look 

ANTI R. R. J - We like those who disagree with us to speak out, so that we may have an opportunity of "reasoning to gether," and we are glad to receive so well written and candid an article as the above, from our friend, if he is an anti R. R. He has however unwittingly managed to destroy the objections he urges, until at the close he virtually upsets it all br admit ting that railroads have built up To ledo, and made it the third city in the State. And we would add that she is. sensible of their importance to her, and is continually reaching out to obtain new roads as contribu tions to her prosperity.'; ' - It is a fact, as our correspondent states, that such a line. as we.. .have urged would fonnd nev. towns and build up old ones, and among the ones it would build, tip would-be ouf own old one; yet while that result would add to tne trade ol otner com munilien, it- would also- add to the number of traders, by effecting rapid settlement of the cor ntry and promoting every branch of industry, Clyde, Lindsey and Elmore have tak en away some of our young business men, it is true, and that very fact is an argument for railroads, they hav ing built up those towns, and aided in the development of the country around them. But railroads have equally benefitted our city, though our correspodent does not 'appear willing to admit it, but' rather as cribes our increased prosperity to other causes. From a town of 1,500 or 2,000 before the opening of the C. & T. R. R., we have grown to city of nearly 6,000, as shown by the recent census. Our town lots, com manding a few hundred doilars each, have risen to thousands. Our cor respondent may argue that the eree tion of substantial . uusiness build ings, on "Front Street has occasioned the increased value .of Lots, but it was the increased business, produced by the -railroad, and the increased population that required those im provements' to meet the wants of trade, and increased the value of business property to form $2,23 to $300 per week, . The statement of our friend that farmers derive all the benefit from railroads, is a little strong, although as a class, they reap as- much ' or more advantage than any other. None of them who are old enough to remember, but can compare with satisfaction the prices received now for their produce, with the prices re ceived years ago. The railroad has opened up other markets for them, and the inhabitants of our city have to compete with consumers in the most distant cities for the supplies which the farmer brings in, or go without them. His farm has increas ed in value, and he has been every way benefitted. In fact, so great is the benefit conferred upon them in this way, that as good business men, they should be willing to aid largely in the building of other roadB. fatis fled that every new one enhances their business and adds to their pros perity. But the same is true of city Droperty. Its price has been ad vanced from 100 to 400 per cent, above its previous 'value. The facilities afforded for shipment have lent encouragement to manufactures and the manufacturing interests of the city have multiplied in a greater ratio, while still in their infancy. But our friend makes a weighty sag cestion,. which, however, does not militate against railroads but rather against individuals, when he inquires why, if railroads are a good thing, those who own large tracts of land around the city, and our business men, do not bike hold and complete the It. cj. as jl. K. K c ine answer is simple enough. They lack what we fear our correspondent lacks, "public spirit" They would rejoice to see the road completed, and tue moment it was done add ten twenty- five or fifty per cent, to the value of their lands, but want others to do the work and provide the means, and they reap the profit Drawing a line from the river south of us around the west end of the city and back to the river north of us, and there is not an owner of land in the semi-circle, but could well afford to pay $3000 on each 100 acres to have that line completed, and on every hundred acres net a profit of as much more, quicker than he could make it at 20 per cent interest. A similar line on the east side of the river misrht be drawn, and allowing for disparity of value, like results be re alized. And there is not a business man in the city but could well afford to contribute toward the enterprise In view of prospectively increased trade. The worksnops oi me com pany being mainly located here, would srive employment to a large number of mechanics, and the in creased population create a demand for homes which would advance the prices of real estate marvelously. Our manufacturing interests would expand, because the road would en able them to reach tracts of country with their manufactures, at present untouched, while the wholesale trade of our city would grow rapidly. And all these influences combined would force a recognition of the truth that all such enterprises bring with them .increased prosperity and. wealth, : Our friend's suggestion in regard to improving the wagon roads into our city is a good one, and should befollowed routltrictly., Improve the facilities for customers to reach our city, oiid they will come, whether those facilities are by means of wag on roads or railroads. - By- all means improve the wagon roads, and in this respect it would be a good idea to follow the example set by those "rivals" of .which our friend speK,i some of which ' are making rapid strides toward; permanent: pro; perity, becauso they haYa; ,, live men "public spirited", citizens ever ready to take hold and push forward any enterpiiso,,whether public pr private, which.promises to arid to the life and business of" their, community. We commend their example to our friend Let us have no "dog in the manger policy, bat, take hold and help us.

I -At Iroaton, recently, a Miss McQuigg, who claimed to have been seduced under promise of marriage, by Presley Barker, armed herself with a pistol, and taking her brother, who also carried s pistol (for the purpose of intimida tion, as he asserts,) with her, visited Barker, and insisted on marriage. Barker refused when the sister drew her pistol and fired kil ling Barker instantly. She attempted to fire again, but the brother, who claims he was not aware she was armed, seized her and attempted to wrest the pistol from her and the ball missed its mark. Both were arrested. , The brother was tried as an accessory to the mar. der, but the prosecution failing to establish the quilt of the prisoner, he was acqintted on Thursday the 1st The court then requested tne Prosecuting Attorney to enter a noilt in the ease of the murdress, assigning as a reason that if they could not convict the brother they would not the sister. The Prosecuting Attor ney declined, when the court assumed ths responsibily and ordered a nolle to be entered, and the murdress was set at liberty. Judge Wright, who officiated, had, it would seem queer notions in regard to the rights of society, when he thus arbitrarily discharged an ac knowledged murdress from responsibility for crime, without even the semblance of a trial. Perhaps, however, the result may be to arouse a feeling that will not regard as loosely the taking of vengeance into their own handB, by parties who willingly permit themselves to bs outraged, on promise of marriage, but who afterwards find themselves deserted. OUR 

BUSINESS HOUSES. of of I a of Though Umifjii in number, and of moderate capacity, still our manufactories are telling their own story by their steady and healthful grouth; and by the spirit and life which they infuse into surrounding enterprises. This literally true of the manufacturing establish ments of our city. There is scarcely a house hold, within the limits of our trade, in which can not be found some article from the ware rooms of TSOHtnfT DOSOTSON. Farniture Manufactories, and wholesale and retail dealers. Passing through their factory, alive with activity, the sound of which drowned in the din of machinery, or looking about their ware rooms, packed with finished wares, one would hardly trace the history their business back to the date of its com- mencement In the rear 18,36, an ordinary frame build ing, "might have been seen" standing upon the lot south of D. June & Co's brick foundry, and directly across Water street from the car riage factory of Mr. J. r. Moore. It was daring that year that Mr. C. VT. Tschuiny took " possession of this building, for the purpose manufacturing furniture. With the foresight of a shrewd business man, he established his business with a capacity which his capital could control and the demands of the time warranted, but with the determination making it permanent and to follow the growth of the town and advancement of the country. In this way he prosecuted a safe and remu merative business, for about three years, du ring which time he had five men constantly employed. At this time he desired, for certain reasons, to make a change in the location, and to make his business more prominently asso ciated with the permanent institutions of the place. Though but little more than a decade has passed since that time, yet Front street presents quits a different appearance to-day from what it did at that time. On the corner of Front and Garrison streets was a large lot occupied by an old log house in the center, in front of which was a garden of moderate size, shaded by two locust trees which stood upon the lot bordering on Front street. Of this ground Mi1. Tschumy secured a lease for four years, and proceeded immediately to erect frame building upon the garden spot in front of the log house. The new building he ased a work room and the log house as a dwel ling. Two years subsequently, finding his facilities lor manufacturing work insufficient for the demand, he tore down the log house and built an addition to his shop, and also erected a frame building on the ground where the brick now stands. In '63 he succeeded in purchasing the ground covered by the lease, and with an additional force of workmen was prepared to keep pace with a rapidly increas ing trade. But the capacity with which the business was endowed, even at this time, was not destined to be the maximum point of growth. This became apparent in '65, when the frame building on Garrison street was moved away to be fitted up as a dwelling, and in its place was erected the brick as it cow stands. The building designed to be used ei cluiirely for manufacturing purposes,! 52x36, two stories high and supplied with the very best of machinery neoessaiy for the work. In May '67 Mr. H. G. Doner son purch.ised an interest in the business, and became a partner under the nrm"nanie of Tschumy & Doncyson. With a broader capital and man agement, other improvements were added, and new ware room built The vacant space be tween the ware room and factory was occupied below a a salesroom and above for work rooms. In January '68 the property situated on Front street near tho railroad was pur chased by them, and three very comfortable tenement houses fitted up. The lot, which contains three acres, is used as a lumber yard and is occupied in part by their barn and lumber sheds. They are at present giving em ployment to twenty-two workmen, eleven of whom have families. These men are made residents of our city, contributing to its busi ness and aiding in its growth, by means of this manufacturing interest, which lias grown through fifteen years of continued prosperity as we have described, reflecting credit upon the controling head, not only in the success achieved and property accumulated, but in the benefit which the business of the com munity derive from the existence of such i nucleus in it midst The money which week ly passes out to mechanics, flows through every artery and vein in the whole system of busi ness. Landlords catch their rent, merchants their bills, and every branch is strengthened thereby. Not only to mechanics does the manufacturer's moneypass.but farmers market their lumber or timber, and from their pockets it passes out into the great business hopper of the city or town. To the enterprise which is pushing forward what manufacturing interest we have, our city is indebted to a greater ex tent than is realized. Take them from us, and this truth would be appreciated. Establish still more and the ratio of growth and increase will be still greater as the new impetus which all industries will receive, will affirm. We present these practical and conclusive proofs of an oft repeated theory, as possessing' a sig- aificence far ' deeper than abstract reasoning.
