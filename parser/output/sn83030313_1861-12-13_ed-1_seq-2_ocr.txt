Notice to Quit. A Novel. By W. G. Wills, Har per & Brothers. The style of tbo author of this novel is not the most pleasing, u"r are the incidents of the freshest character The dialogue is also rather stilted, and the descriptive portions display that kind of baldness which denotos the lack of a keen oye for the picturesque. But it is the work of on educated man, carefully written, the mis fortune being that he has not a sufficiently copious fancy nor enough imaginative power to cnablo him to write a story that would touch tho heart and enlist the sympatic-s. We read,but we do so with aa interest which hardly suffices to carry us through to tho end, for the reason that the book is not amusing. The plot Is mechanically skilful, and there are passages in the book? that of the opening of the first railway in England, for instance?which will well repay perusal.

NEWS FROM GENERAL BANKS' DIVISION. OUB FREDERICK CORRESPONDENCE. Crvriui. Hotri., FaimitaioK, MJ., Dec. t, 1801. Hemmnl of General Hank*' Column f rom liarnatou/n to Frederick?Merit* alony the Hank?How line Troop* Were firedeed al Frederick?Appearance of the Place-*-Condi turn qf the Siokliert, dr. The quaint nud quiet old city of Frederick U very mneb changed in its at .eel and the character aud number of ita inhabitants within tho past day or two. Tho groator portion of tho column under the linmodiato command of i.'sneral Hanks hut already arrived her* from liarncs ti'*n, and the general headquarters baa been transferred from their former abiding placa,nea> Darucstown, t.? a handsome private house in a pretty street of Frederick. The account of the nr.artli of tba column from Dames town here would constitute a hls'ory aa large and lute resting us Xeuophoit's account of the '?Retreat of tho Ton Thousand;" but owlug to tits oWer of the march and the dtlforont routes taken by the art oral brigades, regiments and Ooinpanlus, it is impossible to give any general do scription of the whole movemout. To use the words of a tarraer who lnformod me that Banks was coming to Frederick, with ltis whole brigade, they canto here like "clouds of Bwalto-ws over the hills." The marching was something extraordinary. As an example, which has never boon excelled, it even equalled, let uto say that Captain Oollia' eumpany ef Zouaves, who are acting as a body guard to (ieneral Banks, marched tho entire disunit e hero from iMrncstowa ia eleven hours lha distance is thirty sight miles fey the way of liyatts town, of theroaghest roa.g in tho country, and it was by this route the Zouaves marched. Moat of the troops made two marches of tho Journey, and they have not aB ar rived hore yet. The veteran Abarcrotubie kept his brigado together during this trying movement In admira ble order, and his whole column arrlsred together insole of twenty-four hours Trom Uio time he hail the tents of hie command strii-ik. Tho roads wore as hard as granite with the frost, and during the days of the march the in vigorating rays of the sun sliono upon the great host as . though all nature had o< nilutied to facilitate and ugmst tho movement. The weather still continues tine, and it is oxpccted the rear guard of tho column-will reui h tins city to morrow morning. Thoro was but one unfavorable oircumatauce. That was the coldness of tho weather, which rendered a bivouac almost impossible. Still the fatigue of many of tliu soldiers mado it Indlspen sublo in most cases. And here tho energy and thrift of our hoys served them well. They bad woodsmen among them and axes, and the princes oi the forest fell before their well directed and athletic blows as quickly as 1 can write about it. These were cut into pieces and piled and Urud, and cofTco mado and beef roasted, and the mm, warmed and refreshed, slept under wagons with their feci towards tho tire, more comfortably than many of the chivalry would do In tlielr touts. The sentries went their us ,al rounds, and a r mblo through that bivouac in tb stillnessot tho night?tho cold, chilly nighi?was a st. rn reflection of the soi-nes of tho Revolution, and of the army of elates or Montgomery. What a picture wore guns, ammunition wagons, commissariat and baggage wagons, horses and troops, armed cap-a-pie, all strewn together on the frosty ground, and all, except the slender guard, wrapt in solemn silence. Then when morning broke, how changed was the scene. All this quiet, uncon scious Inst moving forward with banners unfurled, drums heating, bunds playing, and the trump of infantry and cavalry, rc-uchood by tho hoarse rumble of artillery or the rattle of baggage aud store wagons. Thus the column advanced to Frederick. In my noxt lot terl will tell you of the manner in which tlie'troops ore encamped, &o. Tho reception of the army in this city was friendly, but not enthusiastic. American (lags were never before in such demand hore us they are now. While 1 was in a store a while this morning, no fewer than six miniature hags were parciuised, and the "star Spangled Banner" now floats wherever you turn your eyes in the streets. The streets of tho city are more thronged thanthey over were before, and the hotels and boaruing houses are crowded to excess. Wear; d and footsore, some of the troops pace the streets, and agaiu you may moet some laughing, smoking, chatting and walking along briskly and merry. The patrols of lnunlry and cavalry move through the town continually, and their tramp resounds in the -treats night and day. Altogether the aspect of this city, at the present time, Is that of a great military station, ami it is highly interesting. The town has not yet been placed strictly under mai tial law, nor does there soctn to be any special uece.-Hity for such action. Fiikukkick, Mil., Doc. 8,1881. Be woither continues delightful, and the atmosphere ta mild and balmy. The churched to-day exhibited an ur ileal arrny ' m'iitary uniforms, and well clad and attentive soldier?, and the usual observance? of the Sab hath were notod in all the camps. All military tactics were omitted, except the necessary guird mountings and evening dress parades. The city has become almost Intensely qutot. All the stragglers have boen arrested and returned to their sevc ral regiments, and none are now in the streets, excepting those who from general good behavior are awarded per mits by their superior ofllcers. The First brigade,General Abercrombie, Is located on the Baltimore turnpike, about midway between Frederick and Newmarket. A regular guard is now stationed in the latter place, to preserve ordor and prevent the sale of spirituous liquors to the soldiers. The Third brigade, Gen. Ilamilten, Is about one miio south of the First, on a by-road, and about the same dis tance north of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Tho sites of the regiments have boen selected with a view to comfort during the approaching winter. Thoy are generally situated ou southern slopes, with forests <jp tho north and west, and m the immediate vicinity of con siderable streams. Capt. Knapp's Pennsylvania battery, which was origi nally intended as an adjunct to Col. Geary's regiment, has recently been attached to this division and placed under the control of Capt. Best, the senior artillery ofllcor, This battery 1b composed of six ton-pounder Parrot guns, a section of which was yesterday despatched to the Point of Rocks. ? So soon as tho proper stables and huts shall have boen erected Captain Best will open a school to instruct the officers of the battalion in artillery practice. The bat talion ofllcers at present are:?Capt. Best, Fourth United Stales artillery, commanding; Lieutenant M iblenborg, of Pennsylvania, Art] taut; Lieutonant Cushing, formoriyof the Rhode Island battery. Quartermaster, and Dr. Wair, nephew of the great painter, Surgeon. Yesterday Paymaster Richardson paid a visit to the Twenty seventh Indiana regiment and distributed throe mouths'earnings to the officers and men, out of which not less than $16,000 will bo sent home. On the 1st of January this regiment will have been in the service live months, and It m due to U to state that Its conduct and discipline have been in the highosfdegrce exemplary. Colonel Colgrove, now absent In Indiana, commands the respect of every member of bis regiment. The health of those hardy Northwesterinrs is good, the regiment having passed through Che ordeal of the measles. The indiscriminate use of bad whiskey, prooured gene rally from country groggerles, caused great annoyance along the route from Darnestown hither, and in some in stances was near producing serious results. On the third night after leaving Darnestown the Twen ty-seventh Pennsylvania regiment bivouacked on the Monocacy.below the junction. Permission was granted the soldiers to procure supper at the farmhouees. One of tho privates of Company C, an Irishman, named Alex ander Lynch, in a state of partial intoxication, offered an Insult to a lady, when he woa promptly seized by Major Scott; but before assistance couid be called Lynch made a furious assault upon the Major with a heavy Western knife. This the latter wrested from him; but, quick as thought. Lynch drew a second and smaiier knife, and would have killed his officer bad not Lieutenant Colonel Parham arrived just in time to nvnrt the blow and secure the weapon. Tho culprit is now In confinement, awaiting trial. During tho same nlgbt Quartermaster Sergeant Hop pel, of the same regiment, while ratios ngon the ground, was kicked by a vicious horse belonging to the wagon train, dissevering bis ear entirely from bis head and frac turing bis skull. Assistant Surgeon J irkson was thrown from his horse, dislocating his knee, when leaving Darnos town. Surgeon Duffee, of the Twenty uinth, being absent, the Surgeon of roe Twenty-seventh Indiana regiment was called upon to attend the injured men. On the Uth of last month an estimate was made of the sickness in the army, when it appeared that Gen. Banlu' division was tho healthiest by a considerable per ceatage. FMDMir-K, Md., Dee. 9,1801.

The passage of a joint roeoiutton declaring that alavury is the cause of ths war, and that the war cannot bo brought to a successful termination until the cause Is removed. Copies of sit of the foregoing bills and rasolutions wers shown to ate, and I am assured that each one of 111'm wil' bo offered, and pressed to a vote. The opposition aboll_ tlon party si ready oount seventy-seven votes certain^ which can bo sue ed. It is their iuleifttou to win over to their side, If possible, enough mors to give tlwai s two thirds vote, and if thsy succeed tn getting that thoy will pass sll the above measures over the {'resident's veto. It would shock the country If the expressions which they apply to the President could be hoard. "Illinois stive hound" Is too mild a torin by far for them to use. Thoy call htm all the bad names In the calendar, and say that he has falsified all fciir pledges (he never muds any), aDd that bo has become the pliant tool of the slavoocroey. Thoy op?uly declare that they despair of his co operation In any of the above measures, and that they will carry them over tds head. On the other band, it ought to Un stated that there is not the slightest probability that any one of the above measures can be passed by the present Congrats. In the House there are certainly sixty-flve members who have not and-will ant bow ths knee to the Baal of abolition fanaticisms and without some of those they cannot gel their two-thirds vole. So that? If any of the above measures should be-passed by a mere majority vote it would be promptly vetoed by the Pleat Sent. The spilt, lu the republican party bvOosgrees, however, isoom. pteto. Indeed, that party has osassd to exist. Ths obliteration of the old Stats lines of Virginia, Mary land and Delaware, as proposed In the report of the Se cretary of War, and illustrated m the map published in tide Herat n, is exciting an tmmenae amount of dissuasion here and everywhere in Miryland: Iudeed, It is assort ed by all the citiscas of Maryland wh"in I have board spook of It, without distinction of party, that it would bo the most unfortunate thing that could happen to the Mate. The propound measuro would indeed dismember Maryland ami tear bar to pieces even worse than Virgi uia. It would take from her at one frtww two-third* of her entire territory, and that the meat valuable and ler tile portion. The whole of what is called "the Kustern shore,'" which comprises all thai portion of bi-r territory which lies oust of Chesapeake Hay, wil'. :>? torn from her. This includes the counties of Cecil, Kent, (juoen Anne, Talbot, Caroline, Horoheeter, Somerset and Worcester. '1 hese counties are among the riotiest and most valuable iu tile State, and th lr area is considerably larger thm that of the whole Stale of Heluwaie, to which it is pro pos.-u to.toin ihom Then with Washington and Allegha ny counties, her two most western counties, taken from hor, Maryland will ho "ourtaiie.t of her fiar proporUons" indeed. The population of these two counties alone is GO.UOth thoy have an area of 1.400 square miles, and thoy produce of wheat alone 2.000,(UK) bushels annually. Such is tho territory which Mary land is expected to give up. If sho does so it will make her a mere 1'iagmont of what she is m w. she will have but eleven counties, namely, tbe counties of Frederick, Carroll, Baltimore, Hurlord, Anne IVrundel, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George, Pal vert, Charles and St. Marys. The portion of Virginia which it Is proposed to add to what little will remain of Mary iand is three times as large as the whole of M iryland now is, ami six times as large as that part of Maryland with which it will bo Incorporated, it contains sixty nine ooumies and embraces nearly one half of tho present State of Virginia. Instead of adding 'hose sixty-nine counties to Maryland, therefore, Maryland, or rather the eleven counties which i einain of Maryland, will be added to Virginia. These sixty-nine couptius ol' Virginia east of the llluu Ridge are th se in which all the peculiarities which constitute Virginia are to be found, and whatovei name tnayhe given to it it will always be the true Vir ginis. A glauve at the map will show tit.-1 it contains K.chmoud, Norfolk. Yorktown, Uig Petite!, Fredericksburg, Lynchburg, Lecsburg, Manassas Junction, bell run, and the territory now o copied by Beaurcgtrd'a army. It is by tnr the most disloyal pa l of Virginia. If Maryland had it, win would she do with it r She could not cenverl the pi-oplo who Inhat'lt it troin their present love of s tarns sienisni to a lo\ e for the Union. The people of these sixty-nine countas will g eat'.y overbalance the p- ople <d the eleven Mary land counties, and will outvote them six to one on all questions ai the polls. Thus, while tho new State wilt be called Maryland, it will re.dly he Vi ginia, and the comparatively low |io?plo in the eleven Maryland counties will bo at the morey of the people tn the sixty nine Virginia counties. The gunboat I'iuoia, the construction of which was given to riallimoro, is now completed. Hor machinery also is ready, and is new bclug placed on board. The latter is vury powerful, and has some peculiarities which I will describe next week, when it is expected that hor llrst trial trip will be mado. The measurement of tho steamer is 600 tons, her length 170 feel, her breadth twenty-eight feet, and her depth of hold twelve feet. She is copper last, nod throughout, ami is well braced ou the inside with iron plates running diagonally. There is a cabin, and spacious accommodation:, for the otlh era,and coin in: table bunks for tho men. The vessel is pierced for six guns ?u ciicii side Her armament will be twelve rilled cannon and one pivot gun, also rifled. Her maga zines are admirably <? instructed. The ai mal <a this port of .i number of merchant vessels from ITovid'-i.co, Rhode lebtud, with valuable cargoes of merchandise, lias caused some cx< itctnont.

These vessels wcro h ailed wi h articles which were under stood to tie scarce nt the South, such us salt, coffee, sugar, Ac.; clothing, boots und shoes, Ac., and it was expected that the sphculalion would yield a rich return. The managers of the enterprise intended to tusc in a return load of cotton, which tb"y ex)Micted to got at a nominal price somewhere near Beaufort. Thus they expected to innke enormous profits on their < ' goes In both directions. It turns out now, however, that the whole thing was founded on a misapprehension. If any authority to trade with citizens of the rebellious Status bad ever been given to Mr. Simmons, it has been revoked. It would have boon the means of putting into the hands of the rebel* tlio very things that th-y needed most. So the vessels, in stead of finding a market in South Carolina, have sought ono here. The owners have not been remarkably success ful in disposing of the cargoes here, as this m .rivet is well supplied already.

Captain .fames O'Rara was tht chairman of tbe committee, and to him and his fellow officers of the committee is due the merit of having made the occasion ona of graat hilarity.

The lact that the aeceah are expcotiug an order Tor a home guard ui issue from General HaUeck's he..d piartei* tak en in connection with other circumstances, is tolerably good evidence that such a scheme is meditated.
