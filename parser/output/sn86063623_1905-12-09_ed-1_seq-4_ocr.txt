The governor lias appointed Andrew Maroney, formerly his asM,iut in the prosecutor, s office, to succeed Richard IlanL.n on the Hoard or Police Commissi. npis of St. Louis. It would h ive L'fuo fjraeutLl if the president had seen tit to apologize tn Jud-e Parker, Id connection with the insurance clause of his message, f. what he said about him the day before the election. Governor LaFullette has decided to accert the senatorship from Wiscon sin. He will resign the governorship during the present special session of the legislature, which he called to enact some special railroad legislation. The president has appointed Frank lin Lane of Pan Francisco to rill the place of former Governor Fifer of Illinois on the Interstate Commerce Commission. Lane is said to be a Roosevelt democrat, whatever that la. Congressman William Lorrlmer, of Illinois, is author of a bill which he introduced In Congress Monday to deepen the Mississippi river between the mouth of the Chicago drainage canal and the Gulf of Mexico to four teen feet. He has estimated the cost at $31,000,000. Ilenry Wattersoo says that sooner or later the tariff Issue will do for the repubilcao party what the slavery issue did for the democratic party years ago. Undoubtedly the time is coming when ths question of tariff reform will take on a moral aspect and when the republican party will bave to choose between braving a moral uprising and deserting the patrons whom it has served for a price. Representative Lloyd, of Missouri, hrts introduced a bill in Congress pro viding for a joint resolution submit ting to the states for ratification an amendment to the constitution under which senators would be elected by a direct vote of the people. Such a bill has passed the house every vear for eleven years but has always has always failed In the senate. Mr. Lloyd hopes that It may pass the senate this year. The newspapers generally are much amused at the behavior of the Kansas City Star's Congressman Ellis, who has asked Speaker Cannon for a place on the Rivers and Harbors Commit tee, or If this is Impossible then the Appropriations Committee, or If this may not be, the Postoflices and Post roads Committee. Of course Ellis stands about as much chance of being chosen Pope of Rome as of getting on any of these committees. Balfour has resigned the premier ship of England and Sir Ilenry Campbell-Bannerman has been asked to try to form a cabinet. For years and years Sir Ilenry was the stormy petrel of the British parliament. He was a sort of Albert J. Beverage and John James Ingalls combined. He delighted in "rough bouse" like' a little boy. lie never minded getting the worst of it in violent debates, so be got Into the fray. In recent years he has settled down somewhat, and after the stagnant calm of Balfour's administration tbe country seems to welcome Sir Ilenry. The union of New Mexico and Arizona preliminary to their admis sion as one state is not to be justified in tbe flippant manner in which the president treats the subject In hie message. The people of the two territories do not want single state hood. The interests of the terri tories are not Identical. New Mexico will always be pastoral and agricul tural. Arizona Is or will be almost exclusively given to mining, lumber ing and ultimately manufacture. More than half of the inhabitants of New Mexico are Mexicans. The labor will always bo Mexican. The people of Arizona are nearly all American. Both of tbe territoiies are very much more populous than some of the state of long standing. There is no reason why the wishes of the people should be disregarded except insure against a possibility of two democratic eouUrs, THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's message to the 59th congress is the longest message ever sent by a president. It is not as in-tpresting or as well written as the one of two years ago, but it deals frankly with questions of present interest to the public and with constructive policies. One thing may be said of all of Mr. Riosevelt's communications that be is usually in favor of doing something For another thing, it may be said that the moral aspect of public questions usually gets more attention trom the president than the economic The president asks congress to pass laws to prevent over-capitalization of railroads: to irive the Interstate commerce commission the authority to fix a maximum railroad freight rate upon the corap'alnt of a shipper subiect to review bv the courts; to prevent railroad rebates; to put private car lines under the supervision of the commission; to require the railroads to use the Block signal system and other safety appliances; to limit the working hours ol railroad employees. The president preaches a sermon on Capital and Labor but makes no specific recommendations of consequence, lie discusses insurance and urges congress to annex this business In some way but does not suggest the way. He announces a stand pat tariff policy, urges economy In appropriations, and some sort of flexible currency legislation which will insure currency expansion in winter and contraction in summer, ne wants a law passed to prohibit corporation campaign contributions, gives a long dissertation on peace and war, and brings the Monroe doctrine down to date. Ills recommendations under tbe head of Army and Navy are specific and radical. He insists upon appropriations to enable ibe army to be assembled from time to time for large general nianuevers for the Instruction of officers; be wants the system of linear promotion abolished and the merit system adopted; be wants the medical department of tbe army entirely overhauled and greatly Improved and enlarged. One new battleship a year, he thinks, will be sufficient, if to this is added, tbe replacing of the old ships as fast as they go out of date. He pleads for tbe torpedo boat, submarine' boat and other smaller craft of war, 'in which he thinks our navy is deficient. He wants liberal appropriation for target practice at sea.. One of the best things in the mes sage is the -president's treatment of the naturalization laws and the sug gestions of amendment. He also complaioB ' of the criminal statutes and of the worn out rules of criminal procedure. He is indefinite in his recommendations as to amendment of the public land laws, though he says that the present laws are bad. He favors the ship subsidy scheme of building up our merchant marine He treats tbe general subject of Immigration gingerly, though at much length, and the subject of Chinese immigration with fairness and clearness. He makes specific recommendations as to Indian legisla tion rendered necessary by changed conditions in the Indian Territory, ne makes a show of liberality by urging tbe removal of duties upon Philippine importations except sugar and tobacco which are about the only things imported from tbe Philippines. He wants Hawaii fortified and the Porto Rlcans enfranchised. Alaska should have representation in congress, he says, and tbe four remaining territories of the Uuited States should be admitted as two etates. The last recommendation of tbe message is one of the wisest. He wants the state department thoroughly overhauled, the salary list adjusted, the consuls classified, and the representation of this country abroad rendered vastly more creditable and efficient. The message h too sermonlc and is too evidently addressed to the people Instead of to congress. Many of the subjects appear to bave been dragged in, like the subject of Insurance, merely to show that he had not over looked them. He has backed squarely down on the subject of tariff reform and he has gone over to the enemy on the subject of ship subsidies. Sam B. Cook got judgement last week against the Globe-Democrat for $150,000 damages and has a case against the Post Dispatch set for trial In Boone county this month in which be claims JtOO.OOO damages. If he collects thei sum of the judg ments he will be able to get along for a few years without the good will of the dally press. Hard times are wide spread In Europe. In Spain and Italy crop failure has produced great suffering Id Russia both political and industrial conditions have been at their worst for three years. In Germany the agrarians bave had control of the legislative branch of the go ernment for several years and have Imposed tariff duties in the interest of the farmers to the great dissatisfaction of townspeople. In Austria both political and industrial conditions are alarming, and it Is feared that the death of the emperor, which Is likely to happen shortly, may be the signal for a bloody revolution. England is at the lowest ebb Industrially. There is more poverty, suffering and lack of employment than at any other time for a hundred and fifty years. Toe unemployed of London have for months been making threatening demojstratlons and demanding that they be set to work upon some government undertaking. United Stales, Canada and Mexico seem to be the exceptions among the nations. Ia these coun'les unusual prosperity is being enjoyed. Those who have hard and fast theories as to the causes of these conditions find no support for their theories la the cases presented. The United States has the gold standard and high tariff Mexico has tbe silver standard and moderate tariff. Canada has gold standard and moderate tariff. England has free trade and gold standard. Germany, Russia and Austria have gold standard and high tariff. S. C. Neale, foimerly proprietor of the Hlgglnsville Leader, afterward secretary to Congressman Hamlin, has gone back into the newspaper business and will edit tbe Sweet Springs Herald. Mr. Neale was a successful oewspaper man, and it is believed by his friends that he will do well with the Herald, giving the people of Sweet Springs and vicinity a useful newspaper and securing for himself a proper ret urn for his efforts.
