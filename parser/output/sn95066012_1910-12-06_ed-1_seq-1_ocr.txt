The.-e is not one grain of quinine in Pape's Cold Compound, which, when taken every two hours, until three consecutive doses are taken, will surely end the grippe and break up the most severe cold, either in the head( chest, back, stomach or limbs. It promptly relieves the most mis erable neuralgia pains, headache, dullness, head and nose stuffed up, feverishness, sneezing, sore throat, running of the nose, catarrhal affec tions, soreness, stiffness and rheuma tic twinges. Pape's Cold Compound Is the re sult of three years' research at a cost of more than fifty thousand dollars, and contains no quinine, which we have conclusively demonstrated Is not effective In the treatment of colds or grippe. Take this harmless Compound aa directed, with the knowledge that there is no other medicine made any where else In the world which will cure your cold or end Grippe misery as promptly and without any othor as sistance or bad after effects as a 25 cent package of Pape's Cold Com pound, which any druggist in the world can supply.
