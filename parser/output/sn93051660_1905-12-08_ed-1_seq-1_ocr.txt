k; CORVALLIS inn H Vol. XLH. Corvallis, Benton County, Oregon, Friday, December 8. loon. No. JOO THE MESSAGE. President RooseveIt---An torial Picture by The Telegram. Edi- President Roosevelt's message to the first session of the fifty- ninth Congress treats in detail of forty distinct subjects, appertain ing to the domestic and ioreign affairs of the United States. All .of the matters treated in the mes sage are of practical import to the welfare of the country in one direction or another. The range of the topics is wide, from the suggestion of the legislative rem edy for the suppression of the smoke nuisance in the City of Washington to the wider discus sion of the Monroe Doctrine in its later application and the en couragement of sentiment favor ing a permanent international peace arrangement, as the hope to that end now lies in The Hague Tribunal. The subject receiving the least direct and ex plicit attention is the tariff; that which is dwelt upon at greatest length and with most particu larity is the impending question concerning Federal regulation and supervision of railroad rates. The ruling characteristic of the document is ideality of tone. In the wnting President Roose velt has to a considerable extent adopted the art an style of the homilist; but with this he has Dot neglected t be practic 1, nor has he allowed his vision of the higher grounds and the wider possibilities of the government to interfere with his appreciation of existing conditions and ex igencies. In this respect the message is a remarkable docu ment. Much of it will go over the head of the man who prides himself on being intensely prac tical; but its appeal tor the better standard in private and political conduct is strong to the average conscience. The keynote of the message as we accept its wider application is for the universality of interests either for good or ill; urging at tention to the troths which make for the better man and conse quently for the better government. "Taken as a whole," says the President, in his introduction, 'we all go up or go down to gether;" and again he says: "In the long run the one vital factor in the prosperity of the country is the high individual character of the average American worker, the average American citizen, no matter whether his work be men tal or manual, whether he be a farmer or wageworker, business man or professional man." Throughout the entire docu ment, in whatever recommen dation" is made or discussed, President Roosevelt maintains this high standard. ' He addresses the Congressional National heart as well as the head. His appeal is to the cultivation of higher National attributes as to the policies that will strengthen and enhance material attainments. He stands for National justice and National honor first as both of these have domestic and for eign application and for Na- tional profit that is based thereon afterwards. He forgets not the things that should be done, nor the difficulties which beset the doing, but he keeps in mind the high spirit in which their accom plishment should be undertaken. As the public hadjreason to ex pect, the chief topic in the mes sage, the one that is given pre cedence both in place and im portance, is that pertaining to proposed rate legislation. There are other subjects treated at al most equal length, but none bears the mark of the President's par ticular solicitude in such measure as this. The subject of immi gration, touching the character of acquired citizenship; that of , insurance abases; seeking the purification of Federal' election methods; the attitude of this country toward the permanent maintenance of peace; the Army and Navy, and especially the lat ter; our insular possessions, not ably the Philippines and Hawaii; the Canal; the Department of State, with special reference to the improvemen of the Consular service; the admission of the ter ritories, and the recognition of Alaska's demand for reoresenta tion all of these receive at the President's hand explicit and comprehensive treatment. But the subject of the rate legislation, u'nder the sub-title of . "cor porations," bringing in incident to the topics of labor, hours of service upon the railroads and employers' liability, comes . first on the list, and by its treatment it is made to stand out promin ently from the rest. There is general public fa miliarity with President Roose velt's views on this subject. His message is a reiteration and strengthening of his well-known attitude. Disclaiming antagon ism to corporate interests; on the contrary, according to the corporation its due measure of merit in modern-day industry, the President maintains the. uh anawerable logic that it is within the province and duty of the Federal Government to exercise regularitory and supervisory pow ers over the agencies of inter state transportation It is shown that this lies within the Govern ment's province by reason of con stitutional declaration, and with in its duty as protecting its citi zens, including the well mten- tioned managers of railroad in terests, against the encroachments of a erowino' power exercised without responsibility. It is held as a matter ot prime importance that the Government should avoid the harmful effects of corporate energies exercised in ways that are against -the com mon good ; that we face a con dition where interstate transpor tation corporations, by reason of the inefficiency of state control and the denial of Federal control, stands as a snbject without a sov ereign; and that "our steady aim should be," in the language ot the President, "by legislation cautiously and carefully under taken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the National Government by af firmative action." , In the penning of this message President Roosevelt has laid aside none ot his admirable personalitv. There is abundant recognition on his part of awakening public conscience to whicn an appeal from the high altitudes can be successfully made. The tone of the message evinces an abound ing faith in the people. It is a state paper that does credit to this eminent apostle of the bet ter National life.
