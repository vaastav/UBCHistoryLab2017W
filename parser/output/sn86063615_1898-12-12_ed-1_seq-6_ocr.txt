KEW YORK, Dec 11. The Sunday death list in New York ard icinity was greatly Increased by causes that ran the gamut from suicide to murder.

The horses went along at a. furious pace, with the thousands of spec tators applauding the brus.li. Then, with a mighty effort. McDonald's horse took the bit and, with a defiant to-rs of his head, shot to the front. Two blocks ahead the Speedway was impasable to the filers and McDonald, realizing this, stood up In his rig. and dropping one rein, gave the other a mlght Jerk.

COMMISSIONERS FRIENDLY. .o HI Feeling, Personally, Iletvvccn SpanlMh mid Amerleun Pence Commission. PARIS. Dec 11. The United States peace commissioners rested to-day, after the long strain of daily conferences and almost daily sessions with the Spaniards, the Intensity of which they hardly realized until it was1 over. Warm personal friend ships and mutual regard have arisen be tween the two commissions, as the result of their extended controv ersy at tlose quar ters. To-day several members of both com missions exchanged calls. The American commissioners unolllcl illy informed the Spaniards that they would be glad to have the two commissions dine together. The reply, which, like the invitation, was conveyed diplomatically through a third party, was that the Spaniards would be most pleased, but feand it would be In advisable because It might be misconstrued at M ldrid, where alreidy much feeling ex isted against the Spanish commissioners. Several members of the United States commission were, inclined at first to pub lish the text ot the treaty, but Senator I rve made a strong plea yesterd ly tor the observance of courtesv toward the United States senate, and his arguments pre vailed. Further details, however, have been learntd as to the wording of the treaty, which provides that Cuba is to be relin quished and that Porto Rico and the Phil ippines are to be ctded. The Americans are to pay for the repatriation of the Span ish troops from all the colonies. The Span lards are to return -all prisoners held by them. They are to retain pO'-sisMon of all military stores and munitions of war in thi Philippines, and of such ships as have not been captured. The commercial treaties between the two nations which the war ruptured are to be renewed at the convenience of the two na tions. The United States commissioners have been almost overwhelmed with offers of diuneis in England, prompted by the de sire of prominent Englishmen to emphasize the Anglo-American entente, but they will remain in Paris until the day before sail ing for the United States. "ihev will make formal calls upon Presi dent Faure and high otiicials here to th ink them for official hospitalities. 'Unofficial hospitality to the,. United States commis sioners has been ostentatiously lacking in Paris. MADRID, Dec. 11. The government en tirely approves the memorandum of pro test against the action of the United States commissioners filed by Senor Mon. tero Rlos at Paris. El Liberal says: "Tho Paris negotia tions offer a far sadder spectacle than tho ships which are bringing back our re patriated soldiers, deplorablo as the con dition or the latter is." Tho cabinet, it is said, will meet tho cortes intact. Senor Sagasta will ask an indemnity bill for the cession of the Philip pines. The cabinet will then declare that, as It finds itself at a crisis, it cannot admit any debate and will, therefore, demand the Im mediate adoption of the bill, after which Senor Sagasta will submit the question ot confidence to the queen regent. El Heraldo says the government believes that, in the present circumstances, tho holders of the Philippine debt will accept the arrangement arrived at and considers that the Cuban bondholders should demand of the future government of Cuba a fulfill ment of the contract by claiming a mort gage on tho customs which guarantee the debt. The memorandum protests against the refusal of the Americans to surrender the securities deposited in the treasuries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private Spaniards, remarking that "never has a civilized na tion committed such an act ot violence." Secondly. It protests against the ultima tum demanding the Philippines Thirdly, it pretests; against the position In which those Spaniards are placed who delro to remain in Cuba. Fourthlv. it protests against the refer ence to the destruction of the Maine in President McKinley's message to the Unit ed States congress. On this point, the memorandum say; "Spain has proposed arbitration, but the United States refuses to give her the right which is granted to a criminal namely, the right of defending herself. The Span ish commissioners leave the. care of fixing the responsibility for the explosion to the entire world, which will sny- whether those aro responsible who desiro the truth or those refusing to seek It." The newspapers generally express relief at the signing of the treaty. The inde pendent organs, most of the provincial pa pers and the Carlist and Republican jour nals, attack both political parties, .conserv ative and liberal, reproaching them equal ly with having brought the country to the present pass. El Imparcial alone publishes the contents of the treaty, which produces a less favor able Impression than had been expected, owing to the commercial and other conceb slons to Spain. 

LONDON. Dec. 12. The editorials In the London morning papers express satisfac tion at the signing of the peace treaty, the negotiations for which, the Dally News re marks, havo occupied rather longer than the war. The Times, pretty accurately represent ing the views of the other papers, says: "Snain has lost her colonies because her colonial system. was founded upon spolia tion and tvrnnny. The United States ha3 not tretted her any more harshlv than Germany treated France In 1871, or Russia treated Turkey In 1STS. Therefore, the Spanish memorandum of protest is unreas on ible and unjustified." The article then refers to the difficulties f icing the United States and expresses confidence that the "healthy vlgpr and practical capacity of the Anglo-Saxon" will be fully competent to deal with them.

CATIO" RECOMMENDED. Indian Pupils Should He Kept In Con tact "With Our Civilization, Says Miss Keel Industrial Farm ing: Should He In. Foremost Place. "WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 -Miss Reel, su perintendent of Indian schools, in her an nual report, makes a strong plea for the industrial feature of educational work among the Indians. Miss Reel, who was formerly- land commissioner as well as su perintendent of public Instruction for the state of Wyoming, is the first woman who has been at the head of the government Indian school service. In her report Ehe says: "The government has upon its variDus reservations about 2J0 day- and boarding schools, in which there are- over l',000 teachers employed. For these teachers several institutes were held last summer and fall, in some of the Western states, the majority of which the superintendents condifcted, inaugurating a number of in novations, chief among which were the re quiring of actual work to be done In the teaching of sewing, cooking, housework, etc. Garments were made by the teach ers who ara required to teach sewing in the schools, and matrons and nurses were shown how to take the ration list pro vided by ths government and prepare a wholesomo and varied bill of fare for every day in the week. A physicians' confer ence was held and nurses instructed how to ue small remedies. Manual training was also strongly emphasized. "The government has not yet adopted compulsory measures for the education of the Indian children, and the fact is that the dark-skinned sons of the forests do not take to education very' readily. Some res ervations withhold the rations until the parents place their children In the schools, and so strong is the opposition to this that many families havo held out against it until their families were on the verge ot starvation. But this feeling is not general, and during the past year the attendance percentage was very- fair. In the reserva tion schools, the work is divided between the hours ot study- and Industrial duties. The cirls are taught, aside from tho com mon school branches, to become good housekeepers, and the boys are taught farming and the ordinary industrial arts. Besides these reservation schools, others teach the higher branches ot the scientific trades. These schools have graduated a large number of pupils, of whom but com paratively few have returned to their old manner of living, while the great majority are making good citizens. There is still, however, room for improvement, and the alms of the y oung Indian must be made higher; he must be brought into touch and kept in contact with our civilization. Where tribes of Indians havo been surrounded by a good class of white settlers, the debasing effects of camp life have been ended. "The placing of Indian boys and girls at service in families of farmers, although for u few months only the girls' instructed in the practical economy of the family life, the boys in farming, gardening, btoek raising, etc has met with abundant suc cess at Carlisle, where the plan originated. "Industrial education and the necessity of furnishing employment for the Indian student upon his return from school are dwelt upon. Compulsory education and more attention to manual training are strongly urged. "I desire to emphasize the statements ot numerous Indian educators that industrial training should havo the foremost place in Indian education, for it Is the founda tion upon which the government's desiro for the improvement of the Indian is built. The consensus of opinion of the superin tendents at the last summer schools shows that too little attention is paid to this field of labor, and it wns insisted that large facilities for workshops and teachers be provided, 'hat this work, upon which the civilization of the race depends, may rot suffer. "Industrial training should be in a line with the work that students will find on their reservation, and should tend to teach them to become self-supporting. The back bone of an education is the ability to do something; a large majority of the Indians must labor with their hands and the methods adopted should be those which will teach them how to do that, and to enable them to understand existing con ditions and to adapt himself to his sur roundings." Miss Reel also pleads for industrial edu cation for young women, on the theory that "when you civilize the wife you ilvillze the home," and that sewing, cook ing and a course of domestic housekeeping shall bo leading factors in every Indian girl's education. TRICK 0FTHE TRADE. How a Shrewd Farmer Yonth Kept u, Lond of Turkey From Try ing: to Escape. Tho querulous cry- of a turkey attracted the attention of pedestrians along Grand avenue tho other day and eyes that were turned in the direction from which the sound came met a noved sight. Erected perpendicularly abov e the bronze and brown-black mass formed by their crouching bodies, the ruddy, wrinkled thoats and bristly, questioning heads of twenty-five turkeys stood and swayed with tho movement of tho wagon which con veyed them The wagon was entirely open and the sides of the box not over eight Inches high. There was no sign of a means of confinement, yet the turkeys made not the slightest attempt to escape. Tho only movement that could be noticed was the occasional knocking together of two of the turkey's heads when the wagon made a lurch, and following this the bills belonging to the colliding heads would be seen to open and the pecullir "quack" of this questioning fowl would emanate therefrom. As the load of turkeys proceeded along the street the question was always the same: "Why don't they stand up or try to get away?" rinally the shrewd looking man who drove the team mopped for a crossing and one of the curious asked him the question: 'Oh, that's easy," replied the youny farmer, "I laid hot rocks in the wagon till I got the bottom warm and then when I put the turkey s in they sat right dow n and will stay that way as long as the boards are warm." But people who saw the turkey s unloaded at the commission houses said that their feet were tied with the right one bound to the Joint of the left leg so they could use only one foot and could not lift themselves with it.

One of the bet tests of good breeding Is the conduct of people when they travel. They are away from home, and removed, as thev .seem to fancy, from the critical eyes ot those who know them. It is un der such circumstances that they shovv their true character. There are persons with whom it ls a pleasure to travel, and others whoe society on the road Is little less than martyrdom. A stitch in Venetian point lace dates from the seventeenth century, and was called "punto a rlllevo:" the brides which connect the raised How era are called "brides plcotces." The maner of making tho "bride picotee" is entirely lost. At tempts were mide to recover tho art some forty years ago, and an old workwoman was found who had made it in her girl hood, but she proved incapable of bringing tho stitch back to her memory, and the project was given up. White satin, embroidered with convolvu luses in shaded silks and jewels, is a charm ing evening gown; on ono sldo of the bodice is a drapery of the satin, on the other white chiffon, shading to deep or ange, with a bunch of Parma violets and cherry-pink elvet geraniums. To be worn with this frock is an opera cloak of kilted and ruched apricot chiffon llounces, with a deep-pointed cape of velvet powdered with pearls and gold sequins, and applique with violets In raised mauve chif fon with jeweled centers: it Is bordered with mink, and so is the high collar. Although we hear and ee a good deal ot purple-biue. castor and gray, the smartest gowns of the season are without doubt black. One of fine black face-cloth has a skirt with a shaped piece at the back, and is bordered with astrakhan and trimmed with Japanese embroidery in shades of dark blue and gold, outlined with black chenille; the embroidered bodice is slashed to show a lining of pale blue passe, and It fastens on the shoulders with gold scimitar brooche.s, st with pearls and turquoise, over a yoke of gold-embroidered tissue; the tlnv- rounded revers aro faced with blue chiffon. Says S. B. In an English magazine: "Men are -very fond of laughing at their wives for the Interest thev take in their toilettes, the amount of leisure and money thev spend on their clothes, and the anxlety they show for fear any article of their at tire is awry. "It is the subject of manv jokes in comic papers, and leads one to suppose that it is onlv the woman who Is subject to vanity. Now. I'll own that a woman savs. Is my hat straight?' or 'Is mv dress all right, dear?' more than a man. Her dress, being so much more elaborate than the ugly masculine hnblllments, really does require more attention as it is also much more easily disarranged. "Women are, fond of dress. No doubt It Is natural that every- female heart should delight in whit Is pretty and artistic, but the person who spends most time and monev on her clothes is the Idle woman who has no pursuits, no household worries, nothing to think of save what she shall wear at Mrs. S 's dance or reception, and whether Miss B 's hat Is prettier than her new one." Lady's Pictorial: For the second time within the space of a very few weeks tho public has been unpleasantly remind ed that the microbe of superstition, which was fostered and naturally nourished in the dark age, has successfully survived the supposed sterilizing processes ot tho so-called ag2 ot light. We arc accustom ed to think ourselves hugely superior in Intellect and common sense to our for bears, whose rule of life was laid down by innumerable signs and portents and upon whose credulity It was possible to trade to the most deplorable extent. But. ns a matter of fact, we may be said to have advanced in this respect very lit tle beyond them, despite the educational advantages we have had, and the prac tical tendencies of the times In which we live. That strange craving to dip Into the future, that craven dread of the inevi table, that foolish eagerness to dabble with the supernatural, which led our an cestors to the performance of deeds of ahsolute barbarity and positively heathen like rites, docs undoubtedly possess us even at the close of the nineteenth cen tury. We have proof ot it everv day. Do not professors ot the occult flourish among us? Is it not a fact that fortune telling, under various fancv- names, appeals every whit as much to the high born dame as to the servant maid? And it Is onlv too evident that the charlatan can as read ily find supporters among the cultured as among those whose Ignorance alwavs leads them to rebel against the ortho dox. In remote country villages the old wives will solemnly assure you that their rheumatism has been "charmed" away; In our metropolis we find men and women of superlative intelligence relying on much tho same methods for the cure of the va rious ills to which their bodies are sub ject. Indeed, it would almost .appear as if It were easier nowadays for those who lav claim to supernatural powers to se cure a fashionable clientele than to prey upon the Ignorant. This is. of course, an age of unrest and unv holcsome excite ment. We aro forever trying to get away from ourselves, to pluck out the heart of mysteries, and to do in a day what the world has been aiming at for a centurv. The more we advance, the quicker we want to go, anu tne rapiuuy or modern life is enfeebling us to such an extent that It Is at such wretched straws ns "Christian Science" and crystal gazing, fortune telling in its numerous'guisps and Mahatmas, that we snatch as we are borne along. It Is a melancholy reflection, trulv, that superstition still holds us firm ly in its grasp; but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that it is so. while we perceive the readiness with which society welcomes any new "professor" who lays claim to supernatural powers. Life In Central America. From the Xew Orleans Times Democrat "The row they are having over the Fer rocarril del Norte, as they call the gov ernment railroad down in Guatemala," said an engineer of this city, "reminds me of a picturesque experience of my own on the same line. I drifted Into the country while the road was being built, and got a job on section five. My contract called for k5 a month, gold; but they- were having their regular spring revolution or something, I forget what anyhow, they kept staving me off until I got disgusted and quit with a claim of J3T3 A smooth Spanish gentle man talked me into taking J300 worth of government due bills, which, I was as sured, would be cashed In a few weeks at Guatemala Citv. I afterward heard that he got paid in full bv representing himself as my lawyer and making a big bluff about getting down a gunboat. Meanwhile I was haunting the president's palace with my due bills. There are about fourteen rows of guards around the palace, and I never got further than the fifth or sixth strata. They demanded all sorts of affidavits and sworn statements to prove I came bv- the due bills honestlv, and before I found out that that was only a little Central Ameri can joke I had accumulated as many doc uments as a full-blown historical society. At last I got discouraged, also broke, and traded $3W worth of my due bills for a mule to ride to Port Barrios. The mule died on the way. and I walked in. as rag ged as a tramp and as mad as a blaze. I gave the rest of my due bills to a fellow tor a pair of boon and a $6 meal ticket on a restaurant. The restaurant failed next day. so all I got out of the transaction was the boots. If I had met the president just then I would have used them to write my autograph on his anatomy. I came home on a banana boat. Fine country. Central America.' Added This Season.

KDWARD U D1MMITT. Kansas City, Dec. 9, 1S9S. Tree for Konxni City. Dr. Leroy Dibble In a recent ls&ue of The Journal I notice the mass meeting held in behalf ot shade trees in your city. and your Interest in same, and ai I am In the shade tree business I write for full information regarding who the pirtles are who have this matter of working up an Interest in charge It sufficient encouragement ran be given me I would be willing to come to Kan sas City and locate with my equipment, which is made specially for setting out nice trees in a sub stantial and successful manner, and as I give a two year guarantee on each tree set out, and any that die during that time are replaced promptly, free ot charge, you can see that my plan secures to your citi zens Just what they are seeking for. and at the same time relievta tho park board ot any trouble in the matter 1 am pleased to note that your city Is awakening to the shade tree question, because it Is now consid ered generally by good, live towns to be of more real Importance than paving, and. In fact, here In Detroit, real estate agencies, when they are putting an addi tion on the market, find the public entlment de mands that they first set it out with shade trees, or thev will find slow work celling their lots. Detroit Is noted for her shade trees and lovely streets, and this has all been brought about in large measure by the plan I work on, and If your commit tee and citizens will extend me an encouraging spirit no that I may get a foothold at the start, 1 assure you they will find the business like method and prac tical results of trees set out will soon solve the prob lem of shade trees, for the fever soon spreads as proierty holders see nice trees going out In front of tlulr neighbors residences and additions. If your tree committee1 would interest themselves sufficiently to secure orders for say 500 trees as a starter, I would come to your city and take up per manent operations and push the matter in such a thorough manner as to bring about the resji.ts you are seeking, and all It would require on the part of -vour citizens would be the friendly assistance as sug gested This ought to be a matter which would meet at once with the support of the best class of your pri vate citizens, nnd I know tt would, and there should be no trouble whatever In securing orders for the 500 trees as a starter, aa a good many of them could be taken by members of these committees and other private citizens, also the real estate agencies who are pushing vacant properties should be Interested In get ling them in the mo-t marketable condition. The prices for the trees range from $15 each on up, according to the size and quantity taken by tho pur chasers and the locations where they are place 1 .ou can see this is extremely low when you consider the fact that this includes a two-year contract on the life of each tree, and there Is no trouble to encounter la thp matter A ILSON CIUTZER. Detroit, Mkh , Dec. 7, 1S?S. Aliont linllmlted Iisne. To The Journal. The mistakes ot wise men are often overlooked on account cf their rrestlge. Not so with the men that represent tho people who contributed so- freely to the monument that forever must represent the great est fund gathered for a public enterprise In Kansas City. The honorable Convention hall committee as sumed the privilege of authorizing the Isue of 60 000 tickets that contain all the rights of the original 100. I hear nothing but dissatisfaction and con demnation as a result of the same. The prizes men tioned in jour paper before Sunday last are the prop erty of the purchasers of the original issue, and the committee established a precedent In allowing them selves the liberty of lessening the chances of the owners the full amount of the new Issue. IVould it not have been better and more satisfactory to have had an entirely separate drawing for the 60 000 new purchasers, and to have distributed the new prizes unJer a later drawing? Many are Inclined to await the drawing, and to contest the "distribution," on the presumption of the committee. They (the com mittee) were mistaken merely in the ownership ot the prizes, and, in consequence, tailed to consult the rightful owners, or they presumed on the charity of the people too far. Kansas City has practically outgrown the name sh has borne in her natural territory that has been det rimental to her trade, and yet. In the dawning of a brighter day, a new stain appears on the canopy that would eventually shield her in her days of great ness from the lnkv- blackness of a filthy reputation, and that stain executed by the people silently chosea to represent her greatest enterprit-e. I am a stockholder and a heavy purchaser ot th original 100 000 E. C. Kansas City. Dec. S, 1W Our roreign Trnde. To The Journal. In your weekly of December 1 your paper avs es teemed Democratic contemporaries have not attempt ed to explain how the great olumo of exports flowing Into foreign markets succeeds in getting over the Chinese wall that high protectionists built around this country. High protectionists abandoned and pased laws destroying our American trans-Atlantic n erchant marine, left holes In the protection walls for the imnrotetted farmer to run his unprotected produce through, and turned farmer and his agricul tural products over to the tender mercies ol Kngllsh pteamsMp companies, who mako their own freight and passenger rates without competition.

He wa a member of Com panj K. rirst AVet Virginia infantry, in the civil vsar. and in September, 1S61, while marching' through Gilmer count, was shot bv some one in. ambush, the bullet enter ing Smallridge's chest at the lower point of the scapula, on tho left side. passing thence directlv through the left lung into the left entricle of tho heart. The force of the bullet was o broken that it did not penetrate the inner wall, but the reg imental surgeon pronounced the wound fatal and left Smallridge to die. He did not die howeer. but was sent back up the Little Kanawha rher in a skiff to his home in Glemille, where he recovered and has lnce lived. A few weeks ago, while on his deathbed, le asked Dr. G. O. Brown to mako an examination of the wound after his deatli. This Dr. Brown did, and found the bullet imbedded In the heart. Surgeons pronounce it the most extraordinary case on record. Iiivrcaxe of Lionn In Knt Africa, rrom the Birmingham Tost. In several letters received by the last rr.iil from Ea.t Central Africa mention is made, I am told, of the unusual number of lions that hae mau their appearance in the country. One w ell known hunter, w note experience of East Africa ranges oer manv ears, says that thee animals are a perfect terrir. not a night passing without one or more of the brutes breaking Into a Masai Ullage and carrIng on people or He stock. On ono occasion recently a lion stalked into a camp, and, in spite of all that could bo done, carried off a Swa hill porter from within a few feet of a bright watch tire, where there were men awake on guard. Masailand Is otherwise described as a magnificent country, teeming with game of all kinds, and as healthy as can be for Europeans.

LEAVENWORTH, KAS., Dec. ll.-(Spc-cial.) Only a few of tho -volunteers of the Twentj -first remain In Leaenworth to day. The passing of the regiment has been of much meaning to the merchants. All shared well in the trade of the innteer. Some estimate the money left by them in the city, including railroad fares, as high as W.000. Not 10 per cent of the orders placed by the men were repudiated. Dur ing the rush at Rothschild's and at Etten son, Woolfe & Co.'s. two -volunteers picked out overcoats and hustled away. Both were located and speedily paid for their gar ments in preference to haIng a case made out against them. Saloons did a thriing business but tho city was ery orderly for Saturday night.

Eight hundred feet of hose will be carried. On the sides are hung a 15-foot ard an extension 30-foot ladder. The chem ical tank it situated under the seat. Two hundred feet of hose is attached to tho tank. An additional acid tank Is carried, that the generator can be recharged, it necessary, without returning to tho station. There ls an appliance also by which the tank can be connected with a water h drant, in case a lire Is not quite extin guished by the time the charge has be3n exhausted.
