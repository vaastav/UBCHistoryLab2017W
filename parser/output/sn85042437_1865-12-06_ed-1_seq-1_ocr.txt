Tbe rebels bare been dispersed, and the leaders hot. Linns of administration on tbe estate of the late Preston King hare been granted by the Surrogate Court of Lawrence county, N. T. Mr. TJhlcb, Superintendent of the Oceanic Oil Company, was waylaid by highwaymen near Titusrille, last Saturday, and robbed of over $4,000 in money and $10,000 in stocks. Alixiitdir H. Jokcs, Congressman elect from the 7th District of North Carolina, has arrived in Washington, and says he can taVe the teat oath, as be has never been a secessionist. A special dispatch to the Lsadee an. nounces the triumph of the Tammany wing of the Democracy in the election of Hoffman for Mayor of New York. The Tote stood : Hoffman (Tammany), 32,626 ; Roberts (Union), 31,237; Hecker (Mozart), 10,31.1; Gunther (Citiien)6,580. If the Pott an 7Vtiim had supported Roberts instead of Hecker, he weuld undoubtedly have been elected, as he is only 1.3S9 votes behind Hoffman. Report of the Secretary of War. (1 The Report of Secretary Stanton is one of the most complete papers which has emanated from the governmental depart ments for many years. Although an ex tended document, it is written in the most compressed style, briefly recapitulating the campaigns since the capture of Vicks- burg, and giving synopses of the Reports of the beads of the various bureaus of the War Department. The military estimates for the next fiscal year amount to $33,814,461.83. The mil itary force. May 1st, 18C5, numbered 1,000,516 man. It is proponed to reduce the military establishment to 50,000, and 800,963 have already been mustered out. The aggregate military force, of all arms, on the 1st of May, 1864, was 970,- 710, to wit: Available force present for dnty,. ( n detached Berries ... 1 n hospital and unlit for duty...... On furlough or prisoners of war. Absent without It-.ve . M3,34 HW,:t48 117,244 16,4&1 In his review of military operations, the Secretary seems exceedingly careful of the reputation of commanders. Oeneral Sherman's Atlanta campaign is described in quotations from that officer's official re port, while the events in JJorth Carolina which created so much feeling are! thus chronicled : " On the 26th day of April General Johnston surrendered his com mand to Major General Sherman, at Raleigh, North Carolina." In like man ner is General Butler's failure at Fort ifher disposed of: "General Butler effected alanding on the 2&th of Decem ber, but re-embarked on the 27th, and re turned with his troops to Fortress Monroe." General Banks's part in tbe disastrous Red ver campaign is briefly described as fol lows: "General Banks with his forces rcachad Alexandria about the 20th of March. Advancing thence towards Shreve- port, a series of disasters commenced that ended in the failure of the expedition with heavy loss of men and material." It is evident the Secretary has no disposition to place any one in an unfavorable light, not even those who have shown the bitterest feeling toward him. The Secretary recommends the adop n by Congress of "a well-organized militia system, and also measures for the relief of disabled soldiers. The appropriations at the last session of Congress were $516,240,131 70; the esti mates for the fiscal year commencing J une 30, 1865, are $33,814,461 83. On the subject of the ability of the coun try to prepare for sudden war, the Secre tary states that "after tbe disasters on the Peninsula in 1862, over 80,000 troops were enlisted, organized, armed, equipped and sent to the field in less than a month, ixty thousand troops have repeatedly gone to the field within four weeks, and 90,000 infantry were sent to the armies from the five States of OUio,lnaiania, Illi nois, Iowa and Wisconsin, within twenty days." Recruiting for the regular army is pro gressing satisfactorily. The present au thorized Btrength of the regular regiments is 952 officers and 41,819 enlisted men. It is recommended in the Adjutant Gen eral's Report that a law be passed for the enlistment of meritorious disabled soldiers, with the pay and allowances of ordnance icrgeants, as superintendents of the na tional cemeteries. This is a humane sug eestion worthy of adoption. Some interesting figures are given rela tive to the number of men enlisted and drafted under the various calls for troops. Under the call of July, 1S04, for 900,000 . . i a. A-i ri men, tne total ouunnou - which 54,709 were drafted or substitutes. Under the call of December, 1864, for i . a r 300,000, only 194,635 were ooiaineu, oi Inch 24.580 were drafted and substitutes. The aggregate quotas charged against the States during the war was 2,759,049, and the total number obtained was 2,650,563. "This number does not embrace the 'emer gency' men put into service during the summer of 1863, by the States of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, nor those furnished by the States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, during the ' Morgan raid,' amounting in all to over 120,000 men, who served periods of about two or three weeks." The total amount of commutation monev received under act of March, 1863, was $25,902,029 25. The whole sum dis bursed bv the Pay Department during the i n99 239.000. On the 29th of WO r a a T 1 I June last, whisky was discontinued as an wiMn of the ration, and the amount it 1 J : ..f V- s.la on nana na ooeu umuwo The receipts of the- Medical Depart ment during the fiscal year were $20,489,. 680 47: disbursements, $19,328,499 23. The depots of theQuartermaster s .Depart ment have, during the war, furnished 101,- 093 000 bushels of grain, 1,500,000 tons of hay and 20,000 tons of straw, 550,000 cords of wood and 1,600,000 tons of coal. About 15.000 miles of military teiegrapn has been constructed during the war, at a vt of 2.655.500. The total number of rebels surrendered and paroled at the close of the war was 174,223, of which 27,805 were surrendered bv Lee. and 31,243 by Jonnston. The Secretary speaks in complimentary terms of the Freedmen's Bureau, but no details are given, as the report of Major General Howard had not been receivea. Among the "patriotic measures adopted by the Governors of the loyal States," the .id furnished bv Ohio and other Western State La the opening of the campaign of 1864 is especially acknowledged, and the efforts of Governors Brough, Morton, Yates, Stone and Lewis highly commend- ed. At that time Ohio promised 30,000 men, Indiana and Illinois 20,000 each, Iowa 10.000 and Wisconsin 5,000. Tbe Secretary gays : "The State of Ohio or ganized within four weeks, and placed in the field, 35,646 officers and men, being 5,646 more than the stipulated quota. Other States, less able to meet tbe con- tinirencv. contributed with alacrity all that could be raised." Report of the Post Master General. The annual Report of Post Master General Dennison is a very complete and concise document, furnishing in a practi cal form, a satisfactory view of the busi ness of the Post Office Department during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1365. THE 

RKYKNUE8 of the department were $14,556,158,70 expenditures $13,694,728.28, leaving a surplus of $861,430.42 an increase of rev enue of 17 per cen, and of expenditures of 8 per cent, The expenditures for the current year are estimated at $18,678,000; receipts, 17,470,543; deficit, $1,207,457. No special appropriation, says Mr. Den nison, will be required to meet this deficit, as previous appropriations are still unex pended. An appropriation of $500,000 is however, recommended for the payment of steamship mail aervice. The depart ment has issued 387,419,455 postage stamps representing $12,099,787.50; Zd,940,425 stamped envelopes, representing $724,135.- 00; 1,105,750 stamped wrappers, repre senting $23,315.00, making a total of $12,- 847,437.50, being an increase of $1,873,108 .. rrL. 1 over tne previous year. iuo amounted to $12,399,727.85, an increase of 1,623,138.27. The Post Master General says: "The introduction of stamped envelopes bearing a request lor the return to the writers of unclaimea letters nas consia nrably increased the sale of envelopes, and is believed to have diminished the returns to the Dead Letter office." "Business cards are printed on envel opes without additional cost when ordered n quantities not less man one inousana for the same parties. "To encourage the purchase of regvat envelope, the law should be changed so as to allow the return of such letters to the writers free of postage. "As stamped envelopes are cancelled by use, and therefore safer against fraud than those with stamps attached, it is submitted whether the Postmaster Oeneral should not be authorized in his discretion to fur nish them as the separate stamps are now, without reference to the cost ot manuiac- ture. The following figures show the receipts and expenditures of the department from January 1, 1831, to June 30, 18C5 : Aggregate receipts. S2M,S11, 894.47 244.74U, Ml.il Aggregate expenditures. 44,43U,67.12 Average receipts per annum - .$5,gn6.141.8T ,. 7,0S4,lTu.48 Average expenditures per annum- Average deficit per annum . l,2H,f28.61 CONTRACTS. The aggregate length of the mail routes, June 30, 1865 of which there were 6,012 in number was 142,340 miles, costing $6,240,884 per annum. The cost per mile was, by railroad lljc, steamboat 14 jc, celerity, etc., 10c. The increased length of routes was 3,168 miles, and of cost $428,415. Fines to the amount of $56,, 443.37 have been collected from contract- s. In relation to the experiment of railway postoffices, we quote : "Railway postoffices have-been estab lished on several leading railroads, and arrangements are in progress for their in troduction on other lines. The result, so far, encourages the hope that the system, by accelerating the .transmission of cor respondence, and lessening the number of distributing offices, will be of permanent advantage to the postal interests of the country." On the subject of mail service in the re constructed States, the Report states : The number of routes ordered into op eration in States lately in rebellion is 241 ; their length 18, 740J miles; ana compen sation $721,949; a reduction, compared with former cost of service in those fctates, of $881,100 per annum. This, however, results in part from reduced service,which, if increased to tne stanaara oi irequency previous to the war, on the present rates of pay, tho cost would be "For railroad service $550,053, instead of $989,365 per annum. "For 'star' service 266,B4B, msieaa oi $320,025 per annum. "tor steamboat service, wnicn naving been increased, estimated at former num ber of trips, is $63,501, instead of $293, 668 per annum, making the aggregate pay pro rata for all the service $880,402, in stead ot $l,6U3,u8 per annum; suowmg an aggregate decrease pro rata oi tii,- 

FOREIGN MAIL SERVICE. The report states the general of the foreign mail service as follows : "The aggregate postages, sea, inland, and foreign, upon the correspondence ex changed with foreign countries, amounted tn$l,819,028 56; of which amount $1,449, 530 76 accrued on the mails exchanged with Great Britain, France, Prussia, Bre men, Hamburg and Belgium; $275,197 06 on the mails exchanged with tne Jtsritisn North American xTovinces ; ana $9b,2uu 74 on the mails transmitted to and from the West Indies, Central and South America- " The amounts of L nited states postage, sea and inland, were: On the correspondencsexchanged with , ' - DrituM ana !!. continent OI v....... t 570.1SS 81 The British North Aoericsn Provinces llC,48i 28 And on West Indies, untrai anu aoutu American mans t 827,842 83 "The cost of the United States trans- Atlantic service performed by steamships receiving the sea postage only was $405,- 479 56." APPOINTMENTS. The number oi postoffices established on June 30th, 1865, including suspended off! ces in the Southern States, was 28,882; new offices established during the year, 586 ; offices discontinued, 582 ; changes of names and sites, 500. Total appointments during the year, 5,447. "The free-delivery system has been dis continued at twenty-two of the smaller offices, and is now in operation in lorty- fiva of the principal cities. The number of carriers employed was 757, at an ag compensation of $448,664 91. DEAD LETTERS. The Report states that "The nufhber of dead letters received, .-rammed, and disposed of was 4,368,087, an increase of 859,262 over the previous VM? "The number containing money, and re mailed to owners, was 42,154, with enclo sures amounting to $244,373 97. Of these, 35.268. containine $210,954 90, were de livered, leavine 6.886 undelivered, with en closures of the value of $33,419 07. The number containine sums less than one do! lar was 16,709, amounting to $4,647 23, of which 12,698, containing d,Diioi, were delivered to the writers. "Tbe number "of registered letters and packages was 3,966. POSTAL MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.

The abolition of the franking privilege is recommended as a means of making the postal department self-sustaining. The total cost of the five principal routes connecting at points on the Western plains is $1,196,743; total of receipts, $60,92345; excess of pay over receipts, $1,135,819 55. Enlargement of the New York Times. On Monday morning last the New York Time made its appearance m an enlarged form. It has added a column to each page and increased the length of the pages, so that the total enlargement is equivalent to about twelve columns. It is now the lareest paper in the United States, and the largest in the world with tho exception of the London Time, which is or the same size with its New York namesake. We re joice at this evidence that the Times is prospering. It is in many respects the ablest and best paper in the country, and, despite tbe pretensions of the New York Herald, the representative American newspaper. The catalogue of Yale College for 1865- 66 shows an aggregate of 632 students of whom 97 are in the senior class, 107 in the junior, 530 in the sophomore, 156 in the freshman, 192 in the departments of the ology, law, medicine, philosophy, and tbe arts. The several libraries connected with the college contain in all 75,000 volumes. Bnatnes Ednentlom.

Lieutenant General Grant says: He was impressed with the idea from the early part of the rebellion that active and continued operations of all the troops that could be brought into the field, regardless of the season and weather, were necessary to success. Our armies East and West, with out concert, would have been like a balky team, no two everpulling together, and thus enabling the enemy to use to great advant age his exterior linesof communication, and it was a question whether our numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced by his advantages and . superior position. Convinced that no peace could be obtained until the military power of the re bellion were entirely broken. I determined, first, to use the greatest number of troops practicable against the armed forces of the enemy, preventing him from using the same force at different sections against first one and then another of our armies and the pos sibility of a repulse. Second, To hammer continuously against the armed forces of the enemy and his re sources until by mere attrition, if in no other wav. there should be nothinir left but an equal submission with the loyal sections of our common country to tne .udbuiuuuu. These views, General Grant says, were kept constantly in mind and orders given and campaigns made to carry them out. Whether they might have been better in conception than in execution is for the peo ple who mourn the loss of friends fallen and who have to pay the pecuniary cost to say. " AH I can say is that what I have done has been done conscientiously to the best of my ability and in what I conceived to be for the best interests of the whole." General Grant then refers to the situation of the contending forces at the date of his appointment, the main armies of the rebels being commanded by Lee in Vir ginia and Johnston in Georgia ; our forces being commanded by Sherman in the West and Meade in Virginia, General Grant exer cising a general supervising of the move ments of all the armies. Sherman was in structed to break up Johnston's army, go into the interior of the enemy's country, inflict all the damage he could on the enemy's war resources, and if the enemy showed signs of giving way to follow him to the full extent of his ability, while he would prevent Lee's concentration upon Sherman. Grant details his instructions given to Generals Banks, Butler and others. and enters into an account of the progress of the campaigns. Of Butier's movement against Drury s mutt be says ; Tne time consumed lost to us the benefit of the sur prise and capture of Richmond and Peters burg, enabling Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North and South Carolina and bringthem to the defense of thoseplaces. Subsequently the enemy attacked Butler, who was forced or drew back into the en trenchments between the James and Appo matox rivers, aud his (Butler's) army was as completely shut off from further opera tions, directly, against Richmond as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked. treneral Orant gives a succinct and clear expoeition of all tho military movements which resulted finally in crushing the re bellion, and closes with the statement that he knows nodilference between the fighting of the eastern or western armies. All have a proud record, and all sections can con gratulate each other for having done a fnll share in restoring the supremacy of the laws. Report of the Navy. Nbw York, Decemter 5. The Secretary of tbe Navy states in his report that the steamers bought from the merchant service for war purposes, have been to a great ex tent returned to their former pursuits. He reviews the services of the diiivrent squad rons, and says that immediately after the fall ot i ort r isner and Wilmington, meas ures were taken for the reduction of the navy, which have continued until at the present time there are actually in commis sion, at home and abroad, but 117 vessels of all descriDtions.and this number will proba bly be lurtuer reUuceu. As soon as our do mestic troubles were over foreign squadrons were re-established, which are considered sufficient for the encouragement and pro tection of our commerce. 62'Z omcers proved traitors when the war begun. Their places have been filled by volunteer officers from the merchant service, aud it is recommended that appointments from their number be added to the navy. Since the 4tk of March, IStJl, 418 vessels had been purchased at a cost of $L3,3.r(,6.si. Of these three-fuurths have been sold for $5,621,800. The Secretary suggests a thorcuch surrey of the islands on the Pacific coast. The history of the Sea King, alias the Shenandoah, is given. It reflects no credit upon the neutrality ef England. The enlarge ment of the Boston and jN'ew York JSTavy Yards is urged, and the completion ef the yard at Man Island, on the Pacific ; also rebuilding of the yards at Norfolk and Pensacola. League Island is recommended as a site for building a yard for iron-clads. As to the healtluness of iron-clads statistics show that they are eoiial, if not superior, to ordinary vessels. The Secretary recom mends tne appointment oi one-nail ot tne midshipmen from enlisted apprentices, and the remainder from Congressional Districts. The number of vessels captured and sent to the coast tor adjudication from May 1st, 1861 to the close of the rebellion 1,161; while the number captured and destroyed 1.504. GroHS price of property captured rince tbe blockade, prior to November last f21,S-iy,MJ; expenses 1,01 n.l'lM ; estimate for the vear endincr June JO, 1804. is 982,457. The expenses of the Navy Depart ment since the commencement of the war have been but 9 3-10 per cent of the expen diture of the government during the same time. Treasurer's Report Niw Tom, December 5. The Secretary of the Treasury believes a decided move ment towards the contraction of the curren cy is not only a public necessity, but it will speedily dissipate all apprehension that the effect of such a policy was to make money and diminish the prosperity of the country. The Secretary earnestly urges the reduction of currency. He reviews the cause of the present inflation of the currency, and says that the couutrv is far in advance in real wealth of what it was in 1357, when the last severe financial crisis occurred. The people are comparatively free from debt, and the banks are regarded as generally solvent. The paper circulation of the United States on the 31st of October last was $734, 218,038.20 and is being daily increased by notes issued to National Banks. On the 30th of last September the deposits of the National Banks were $544,150,194. Their loans, including investments in United States securities, amounted to $913,045,629. The Secretary reoommends Congress to declare that compound interest notes shall cease to be a legal tender from the day their maturity and that the secretary be authorized, at his discretion, to sell United States bonds, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding 6 per cent, and redeemable and payable at sucn periou as may oeconaucive to the interest of the Government for tbe purpose ef retiring compound interest notes and United States notes. The statement of the public debt on the 31st of October, 1S05, was $740,854,750. Re ceipts for the year ending June 30th, 1807 it is estimated will be ?39ii.OIIO,000.000. Esti mated expenditures $28,481,718,188. He recommends tbe revision of the reve-. nue system, to accomodate the changed con dition of tbe county.- He regards the reci procity treaty which expires on the 17th Marcn next, as emoarrassing tne arrange ments of revenue. Tbe attention of Congress is called to the subject of our mineral lands. The working of the Marine Hospital sys tern is not regarded as satisfactory, and rec ommends that authority be given to the Department to sell all hospitals not needed On the 31st of October last 160 banks had been organized under the National Banking system. The Comptroller recommends several amendments, one that the banks be com pelled to redeem tbeir notes, at one ef three cities, Philadelphia, Boston or New York, which is heartily endorsed by Secretary. He regards the establishment of a national banking system as one of greatest achievements of the age, and it not probable that the increase in circulation will be required to De nmiiea by law.

He recommends each county to organise a company to support the civil authorities. Tha Gnmrnnr sava the result of the war has been such as to forever banish the heresy of secession. The war has determinea tne lm nracticabilitv of secession, and it only re mains for the Judiciary to decide that seces sion is treason, to have the subject forever adjusted. Thi. .Hintliitatinn ahonld pronerlv be had in the case of the chief of the rebellion to make a precedent. The Governor argues that the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment would give perpetual indemni ty ar&inst the attempt to control the quea tion of suffrage through the Federal powers. He recommends its aaopiion oecauBe slav ery has ceased to exist, and the universal nation has made freedom a thorough ly national question.

Another smuggling dodge has just been de tected. An unusual number of coffins have been brought across the line of late for in terment on the American side. Last week the United States Revenue officer insisted upon seeing the corpse after the coffin was landed, against the earnest protest of the stricken relatives, when, instead of contain ing a defunct body the coihn was found piled with costly silks. Two per cent of all the fractional curren cy received at the Treasury is counterfeit. This comes to the Department from bankers and ethers escaping.

Mr. Seward's Account of the Attack Upon Him. AN INTERESTING STORY. The American correspondent of th. London Spectator writes that he recently heard Mr. Seward and Mr. Frederick Sew ard give the following account of their own sensations at the time of the attempt ed assassination : " Mr. Frederick Seward said that on stepping front his bedr.'Oni into the pas sage ana seeing the assassin.he merely won dered what he was doing there, and called him to account. On his resisting the fel low's endeavor to press into Mr. Seward's room, the assassin drew a revolver, which he presented at Mr. Frederick Seward's head. "What followed, it must be remem bered, took place in a few seconds. Mr. ' Frederick Seward's first thought was, ' That's a navy revolver.' The man pulled a triegsr, but it only snapped, and the intended victim thought, ' That cap missed fire.' " - ' - His next sensation was that of confu sion, and being upon the floor, resting upon his right arm, which, like hn fath er s jaw, was barely recovered from a bad fracture the assassin hed felled him to the floor with the butt of the pistol h put his hand to his- head, and finding a hole there, he thought, 'That cap did not miss fire after all.' "Then he became insensible, and re mained so-for two days and more. Hi first indication of returning consciousness was tbe question, 'Have you got the ball out?' after which he fell off again into a comatose condition, which waa of long continuance. tha dav when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated Mr. Freder ick Seward, who was Assistant Secretary of State, had asked his father what pre paration should be made for the presenta tion of Sir Frederick Bruce, which waa to take place the next day. Mr. Seward gave him tne points 01 a repiy to 00 ujouo to Sir Frederick, and he laid the outline of the speech upon the President s table, and, as 1 have previously miunuoi mj readers. Mr. Lincoln that afternoon wrote out the reply, adopting Mr. Seward's sug gestions, ana tnus preparing iiiat rtm-p-tion of the British Minister by President Johnson, which was regarded at the time by the people to whose representative it was was addressed as so friendly and fair and dignified. "Mr. Frederick Seward's first inquiry after he came fully to his senses, which was a long time after the assassination, was : 'Has Sir Frederick Bruce been pre sented T He thought that only one night had passed since he knew not what had happened to him, and his mind took up matters just where it had left them. "jlr. Seward s mental experienceaunng bis supposed assassination was in its nature so like that of his son, that it raises the question whether this absence of conster nation and observation of minute particu lars is not common in circumstances of un expected and not fully apprehended peril. Mr. Seward was lying upon his side, close to the edge of his bed, with his head rest- mo; in a frame, which had been made to give him ease and to protect his broken jaw from pressure. " He was trying to keep awake, naving been seized upon by a sick man's fancy- was that if be slept be would wake up ith lockjaw. He was brought to full consciousness by the scuffle in the passage way, followed by tbe entrance or tbe as sassin, and the cry of Miss Seward, 'Oh I he will kill my father I' But he saw no thing of his assailant until a hand ap peared above his face, and then his thought was, 'W hat handsome cloth that overcoat is made of.' The assassin ! face then ap peared, and the helpless statesman only thought, 'What a handsome man !' (Payne was a fine looking fellow.) " J. ben came a- sensation as ot rain striking him smartly upon one side of his face and neck, then quickly the same upon the other side, but he felt no severe pain. This was the assassin's knife. The blood spouted, he thought 'My time has come,' and falling from the bed to the floor, fainted. His first sensation of returning consciousness was that he was drinking tea, and that It tasted good. jirs. rew ard was giving him tea with a spoon. He heard low voices around him, asking and replying as to whether it would be pos sible for him to recover. He could not speak, but his eyes showed his conscious ness, and that he desired to speak. They brought him a porcelain tablet, on which he managed to write, "Give me some more tea. I shall get welL'- And from that moment he has slowly but steadily re covered health and strength.
