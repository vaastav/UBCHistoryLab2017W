Home will just as happy If tri bute Is not paid to the bathtub trust. A St. Louis man compelled his wife to cut his hair. Wonder if it was "as good as mother useter do It?" "With the president's kind words a6 a recommendation, no doubt Elihu Root would be able to get a job almost anywhere. Having so many things to speak of in his message President Taft forgot to advise congress to do Us Christ mas shopping early. President Taft recommends econ omy, but congress holds the purse strings; and a crowd has great diffi culty practicing economy. The British election shows a dispo sition on the part of the people to stand pat. quite contrary to the inclin ation of their American cousins. A Chicago man has sued his wife for beating him with a carpet sweeper. That is merely another evidence of the march of progress. The carpet sweep er is the successor to the broom. Senator Dick of Ohio says he is glad this is to be his last term as a mem ber of the most dignified deliberative body on earth. Possibly he really be lieves some people will think he is in earnest when he says it. Does not this ideal Christmas sea son weather remind you that there is a duty you owe to some less fortunate fellow mortal. No man can be truly happy who does not think of Borne one else when the gladsome holidays are approaching. A well known writer declares that the only thing the matter with this i country is the enormous increase in population without proportionate in crease in the number engaged In ag riculture. Something over a century ago 90 per cent of the American people were living on farms while today not more than 33 per ce Jt may be so classi fied. There are a good many contri buting reasons for this growing dis parity, yet few writers take into ac count the most important, and that is the fact that modern machinery, has made is possible for one man to do the pork of half a dozen in the growing crops. I.aFollette. Senator. La Follette's bitter attitude toward the Taft administration is doubtless correctly reported. One gets it from various sources. 6ays the Springfield Republican, that the insur gents have returned to Washington for the session in a jubilant state of mind over the result of the elections. A certain member of the old guard now on the scene has sarcastically said that he would not be surprised to see some insurgent introduce a resolution congratulating the democrats upon their victory. Republicans like Sena tors La Follette and Cummins evident ly regard the political revolution as a necessary preliminary to the capture of the republican party by their own wing and their own advancement to the dominating places of leadership. As for Mr. La Follette, there is no liv ing republican strong enough to pre vent him froni seeking the national leadership for himself, regardless of the effect upon the Taft administra tion. Colonel Roosevelt has very little control over him; indeed, in Wiscon sin the senator is undoubtedly stronger than the ex-president. But, as things are, tne ex-presment is not HKeiy to make any effort to restrain the activi ties or curb the ambition of the Wis consin leader. Senator La Follette is nominally a republican; in reality, he is a free lance and in business for himself. Uniformity of Laws. It is when the governors of the var ious states get together, as they have at" Frankf6"rt, that there is impressed on the country the necessity of more uniformity in laws which govern the commonwealths of the nation. The governors have had forced on their at tention the manifold annoyances which result from lack of uniformity, and their combined experiences make a formidable argument for this simple, common sense reform. In the early days, when there was comparatively little travel and men seldom changed their place of resi dence from one state to another, uni formity in state laws was not a ser ious question. In those days there most all or them were based on tho old common law, they did not differ radically. What inconvenience was caused by the different conditions in different states was trivial. With the growth of transportation and other facilities for interstate com- tjgtUriflaUon)tath4et6sh.aa-been a -gradual wiping out of state lines in trade and . disappearance of boundaries in the so- j clal life of the people. We retain our pride of state, but a considerable num ber of us live in or do business in two or more commonwealths, and find con flicting laws an absurd restriction on our activities. As an instance, stat utes covering commercial transactions create a' lot of trouble and unnecessary work because they are not uniform throughout the nation. One purpose in getting the gover nors together in annual conference was to have them suggest means for se curing the adoption of uniform laws on such subjects as demand legislation of this character. Their recommenda tions along this line ought to carry weight with the various state assem blies. . ' Cheerfulness at Christmas Time. Mrs. Franci3 Hodgson Burnett has been crowned the queen of cheerful ness, an honor indeed enviable. In a dispatch from Boston Fhe is quoted as saying"cheerfulness is the religion of which I am the apostle. It is the greatest of- qualities except love. People 6hould forget their devils and keep their pink lamps lighted. That is a little word among my friends. A pink lamp always makes everything look lovely. So we'll tell each other all the nice things whenever we can. You must sacrifice everything to hap piness." Cheerfulness, is the motive power cf the world. It is the great lamp from which gleams the light that illum inates the universe. It is kept burn ing by love. But for fear of growing senti mental one may return to Mrs. Bur nett's especially pertinent suggestion that "if you are happy you know you are bound to be good, for you can't be happy unless you are good." That indeed is the essence of hap piness. Its application may indeed be urged in this glad Christmas season. Let Christmas mean what it really is happiness, love, charity, '""hristi anity. Let us be cheerful ourselves, but unselfish in our cheerfulness. Let us make ourcslves more cheerful by making others happy. Let there be some practical charities that will reach the homes of the poor, lighten the darkness of the wretched, inspire hope in the souls of the discouraged and contribute to the wants of those in -distress and who, through thMr own misfortune or of those upon whom thej are dependent, dread Christmas be cause of its joy. its luxury, its extra vagance, its extremes of revelry are a mockery to them by which they are made to feel only keener their own! wretchedness, wazit and poverty.

Into.vicantx and Tobacco. Harpers Weekly: We are drinking more alcoholic drinks than ever more not only in gross, but per capita. 'So the internal revenue bureau says after totaling up its receipts for the year i eauing on cue oum ot last June. Mere i is its report of some of the products that paid taxes: 16.1,000,(100 gallons of distilled spirits, 3ft,ono.oon gallons more than the year before. 59,485,117 barrels of fermsnted liquors, an increase of 3,000,000 barrels. 7,600.000.000 cigars, 160,000,000 than in 1909. 6,830,000,000 cigarets, an in crease of 1.000,000,000. 402,000,000 pounds of plug, fine cut, cube cut, granulated, or sliced smoking or chewing tobacco or snuff. 4.000,000 pounds more thau the year before. 141,862.282 pounds of oleomar garine, 50,000,000 pounds increase. It appears that the consumption of spirits increased last year by over 20 per cent. Perhaps taxes were paid on more liquor than was drunk, but the payments from year to year are a pretty close measure of consumption. That drinking should increase in the face of such prohibition and local op tion legislation causes some astonish ment, but it is not, we believe, con trary to experience. Legislation may have an effect on manners, methods and details of consumption, but it does not change habits. Prohibition, if Maine is any criterion, does not help at all in promoting temperance. Local option may do good, but it is more likely to benefit the rising generation than the one whose habits are formed. It is possible that in spite of the internal revenue figures the manner of drinking may be improved and the i drinks distributed. It bears on this subject that of the 9.000.000 of population in New York state 7.000,000 live in cities. Local option in this state is confined to coun try townships. The increase of city population all over the country has doubtless a relation to this inqrease in the consumption both of alcohol and tobacco. The nervous tension of city life is sreater than of country life, calling more for stimulants, and affording more convenient opportun ities to get them. Drinking and smok ing, too, are both social practices, and there Is more society in the cities than in the country. The consumption of spirits has In creased more in proportion than the consumption of beer, and the consump tion of cigarets more than cigars. 1 The report Is not complimentary to legis lation. :
