ReminiscenceLast winter while the writer was in Washington as a delegate, many strange and comi cal incidents came under his obser vation. Oue evening in the lobby of the National Hotel where he lodged aud "et", at the exp nse of the tribe, he-S'it by himself enjoy ing one of those thing* (a cigar) which vhe Rev. Stanley Robots of Minneapolis says is an abomina tion before the Lord andjan offen-e to the clerical hair and mustache. Presently a well dressed but slightly hesitant in gait gentleman' approached and opened up a con versation. It began, I am Mr. of Norfolk, Virginia, may I abk you to join me in refreshment and with a wave of an arm to wards the buffet, the action indi eating the nature of the "refresh ment" hospitally proferred. The. writer by nature is reciprocal yet abstinent, he declined the refresh ment but endeavored to reciprocate the courtesy of mind. The declination was couched in language that would have pleased Lord Chesterfield. The Virginian bectine very gracious and accepted blandly the terms of regret and declination. Then he weaved his way to wards another gentleman, ones whose antipathy to alcohol seemed as strong as that of Mr. Roberts .to tobacco. He declined sternly, al.nost viciously. He cited his ancestry, their sfcern views on temperance and their precepts to theirs of gener ations even unto the third, that to which he himself belonged. His Sermon OQ temperance was dogm-uic, his adherence egotistic. It was not brief and fche Virginian had taken a goal fche while listen ing courteously yet amusedly. The aarmon concluded, he onen ed hii* month t a question, "Do you love raal" "Yes," answered the man *ho knew not "strong drink aor wiao," ''Ye*, I love and wish to&ava." A drunken smile stole

The message is beihg printed ind read throughout the civilized world. In it our Commander in Chief recommends war on Austria, de claring thr.t nation is but a vassal of the Kaiser, reaffirms U.

The piascnt editor recently came \rross some notes marie by th* late editor and intended for publica, tion The words "To be continn- *d, show that the article inter did was to hive bean of some length. We publish the article without ad dition or alteration so that our readers may f*e that "Gus" is speaking to them directly, even though fc.be brain is silenced and the mind has gone to another and a strange world: "The Indian Question From an Indianthe Yii& Pcint. We mentioned in our last issue that many '.reaties had been made by the United States with the Chippewas, and we add that it(ihe Governonent) failed in every in stance to fulfill any of these as In dian history, if not Government records show. While the Indians do not charge downright dishonesty ou the part o'f the United States, from a large moral pount of view they will at least say, advantages were taken of technical points, aud construe tions were placed upon treaties which were contrary to the plainly expressed agreements between the representatives of the government, and the Chippewas as the latter were mal to understand them And let us look upon another situation that was of no credit to the United States. In 1812, the year in which war broke out be tween tSiis country and Great Britain, the United States failed to fulfill treaty stipulations with the American Chippewas, because lYcumsen, with the Canadian Chippewas, became allies of Great Britain. The United States thought perhaps that all the Chip pewas including those who were American Chippewas, would act alike. But this, if at first entcr tained, should have been put out of mind "byfchesreedy succeeding events. The American Chippewas re mained loyal to the United States. Chief KUJi-ke mun, and ances tor of the writer, was then the leader of the American Chippewas, and at an, interview with the Brit ish commander at 'Mackinaw Is land, at that time Canadian terri tory, he voiced the attitude of his people in no uncertain terms. The ineidflJt is related in Warren'* Uibiory of fche Ojibways, and men tioned agtin in "WiiichelPs His tory of the Aborigines of Minne- sota." Under the tieaty of September 8, 1815, inserted therein wa.% that all the Chippewas were associated with Great Britain, but restored to them were treaty righes. but the Indians seemed never to have received ih^m. is not charged h5re that the government deliberately failed to keep its promises. The reasons were probably physical, and here we are referring to the Chippewas who were numerous and scattered along the shores of the Great Lakes, and also inland to the region? of the Mississippi River and to Leech Lake, Red Lake and North Dakota. Detroit, Mich., was the place designated as the Agency where annuities phould be paid. This point was at to*o great a distance for the annuitants to approach for the sole pui pose of receiving the very small per capita shares to which they were entitled, and the Indians not receiving them, the gros3 sums reverted annually to the Treasury of the United States. This was likewise the case in nearly all the treaties made with Chippewas prior to 1855. [In the meantime, the Chippewa hation, numbering probably sixty thous and people, occupied tfcd- territory of Michigan which extended as far north as the international bound ary line between the United States and mada. In the course'of the advauce of civilization westward they were forced north and west ward step by step. And in this connection it is worth mentioning as a matter of history among these, that the United States at tempted to induce the chiefs and head men of the nation to join the Michigan Chippewas in ceding the whole of the northern portion of State of Michigan in the treaty of July 31, 1855. But this they refused to do principally probably, because of their reluctance to travel such a long distance from their ponies by birch bark canoes, to Detroit. Michigan, where they were requested to come and make the treUy. Up to this date the Chippewas as a n-ition have never ceded their rights of occupancy to the territory they occupied in Michigan, and to which the United States, acknowledged the right of ownership under the Prairie du Chien treaty of 1825, which we have hereto/ore referred to. But prior to the tieaty of 1855 the United States hid commenced to make treaties with certain com munities of Chippewas they desig nated as bands, no doubt ia order to take the sting from a doubtful transaction. The first treaty made with a community was that of May 9, 11)36. By the terms of this so called treaty, the communities or bands ceded to the United States their right of occupancy which had been retained by the Chippe wa Nation under the treaty of Nov. 17, 180T with the United Sta'es. The last treaty which was made with the Chippewas as a nation was concluded at St. Peter, Minnesota, on July 29, 1837. But so much dissatisfaction was caused by this treaty, because a large portion of she ration had not authorized it to be made, that the treaty of October 4, 1842, was made to nolify the Nation. Although the Chippewas, Otta was and Pottawatamiea were not t^TSw-^ip. 'Truth before Favor. White Earth, Becker County, Minnesoi,* Thursday, December 13. 1917. onto properly member* of the Ojibway Nation, the treaty of Jurjo 15 and 17, 1846, with a small portion of them, declared them to be known a the Pottswatamie NaUon. This separation of a cer tain portion of the Original Chip pewa nation, from the ration, has caused more or less confusion, and which will require an appeal to the Courts of the United States for correction if the nation should ever desire to push its claim against the United States. To be Continued." The late writer had evidently much to say, but what that is we shall never know. To the present editor's knowl edge he had added largely to his library last winter in literature of hisCory and biography and com mentary on treaties. He was making diligent study of all questions affecting the Chip pewa Nation, and was looking far ahead hoping for fruitions of hopt-a which those who knew him best, shared and with confidence. Ws have lost a mun who looked furtVr into the future than any of us. He was well equipped in historic and treaty knowledge, and was -"till the student of the history of the past and its wrongs, and was living in hopes for remedial meanures by the government itself. The Claims Commission has an arduous task before it, if it will take up the work initiated by the late friend of the Indian, and champion of his nation.

We had as a people been vague ly aware for many a year that Germany was no friend of ours. There was a vague spirit of con sciousness, that given a plausible opportunity she would make war upon us. She has never liked our Monroe doctrine: the Venezuelan incident was almost a defiance. Admiral Deitrick's actions in Manilla Bay was another evidence of Germany's seeking- her oppor tunity. And since the beginning of the European war. and when victory seemed to be hers, she has less concealed the mailed fist extend ing also towards u*. The Lusitania incident was one straw, then other things followed, but ID. the interest of our own peace, and in our sense of neutral ity we bore insuljts scarcely con cealed.

Most of those who claim to be friends of the Indians cannot give credit to the Indians that they can get along without support, one way or another, aud therefore they must do something in order to help them. They behe\e if there is any one who can help them it is the Government with its Indian Oflice. They claim it is, the duty of the Government to do for the Indians and not the people so they go on preaching blindly thinking there is a remedy in the Iodian Office system.
