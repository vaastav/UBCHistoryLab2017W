"N. S EDITOR. .u:iir.sn.u jjorxng, iilc. j, iss 'Z PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. VeF-id'ent Arthur's last Message to rt3 is a very able document, I occupies considerable space. The a -a review 01 me paper is quite !autive, aud wo giro it herewith, j i!i?caiige itself is too leugthjr for r colilinos : Chester A. Arthur close the loDg :, of Annual presidential messages ;!i Republican executives with a Mines like document. It is long, tt none too long to express ia a terse aimer tho various subjects to which ;io attention of Congress is called. The itiesdago begins with a eongrat lition to the American people for ,e loyalty and good temper displayed i I lie recent election, wheu so small plurality decided the question; and Ir. Arthur improves the opportuu'ty :!mi? aflordcd ta again call the atten- brded ta Con fits 'ou of Conccss to the necessitr of J method er ounting the electoral vote. ?Fe as-'' pd says very truly, that any at' rhich will settle this question 'preferable to continued in- uu)(uUnco is the relation United States with foreign these are treated alpha- f ianing with'Belgiuai and vslu v enczuela. With all the is oi the world toe United -Hates is at present on fricudly terms. There are, however, some claims here an J there which iieed to be settled. In 'Chili a convention will soon be ne gotiated to indemnify Americans for losses caused by the .recent war , be tween that country and Peru. The difficulties between France and I China form an embarrassing feature of our eastern relations, although. China Las paid promptly the losses sustained by Americans in the Canton I riots. The President renews his rec ommendatiou of last year that the 'hiucee indemnity fund be returned "at country. This is un act of which should not be delayed. Arthur also fears that the Chi jgh ffclusiou act violates in some Jf s the treity rights of certain sub- as of China. American commerce ia the east has bee strengthened to a considerable extent by the purchase of a largo trading fleet formerly sail ing under the Chinese flag. Tho United States has been embar ras."vl by the withdrawal of its repre-fi.u..-ave from Egypt, aud the Presi dent, hope? that diplomatic intercourse with thai country will be resumed, es pecially as the United States is one of a treaty powers whose duty it is to itct the rights of foreigners. The Barlholdi statue comes in for executive recommendation that gress take necessary steps for its ptiou and for providing a proper -tal. i ho insurrection in Hay ti and re ions attempts in Cuba have neces id action on the part of th Unit izes to maintain neutrality and I-!) those organizing filibustering litious in this country, pan is about to thoroughly revise reign treaties, in which revision rica will be represented.

V and II, vice of the country are not satisfac tory to the President, and ho wau's arrangements made whereby the dig nity of the United States can better be maintained. There is a Mirplus revenue this venr of $05,003,3915,09. There was a" net decrease of expenditures of over $21 000,000, and tho aggregate receipts were about $54,000,000 less than last year. President Arthur recommends the immediate suspension of tho coinage of the silver dollar, there having been issued of these pieces nearly 1X5,000, 000, of which only about 22 per cent nre in actual circulation. Ihe recom mendation to abolish all excise taxes except those on spirits is reuewed and Congress is earnestly invited to con sider the best means of increasing our foreign trade. The contraction of the currency caused by the gradual retirement of bonds is a question calling for a solu tion, lue i resident approves the rec ommendation of the Secretary of war regarding the necessity of a proper system nf coast defense, and he also recommend the establishment of two government gun factories. Mr. Arthur gives tho status of the new steel crnistrs ordered by the pre vious Congress. The Chicago is half finished, the Atlanta successfully launched, the Boston and Dolphin leady for delivery. The monitors, Puritan, Terror and "Araphitrite are being reconstructed, while the Monad- nock and Miantouomah remain as they were, owing to lack of appropri ations, ihe r.aval Advisorv Board recommends the construction of more steel cruisers of forty five hundred and three thousand tou burden, of three gunboats, one dispatch boat, one armored ram, and three torpedo boats. Tha President gives in detail the ac tion of the government with reference to the brioging home of the bodies of Commander Da Long and his com panions and the rescue of Lieutenant Greely and his surviving comrades. lveterring to the report of the Post Master General, Mr. Arfhur speaks of. the srecess achieved in the reduction of postage to two cents. The estima ted loss of revenue at the time the bill came before Congress was 83.000, 000, the actual deficit is $2,375,000, which he justly characterizes as a cum. plete, vindication of the change, lis recommends the unit of weight shall be changed to one ounce, instead of a half ounce, as now, is in favor of ex tending the free delivery of letters and reducing the postage on drop letters to one cent every where. He also ad vocates extraordinary postage, regula ted by stamps, for extra speedy delive ry of important letters in our large cities, thus doing away with the pri vate express enterprises now in vogue. The position of the subsidizing rail roads aod the forfeiture of land grants, where the letter and 6pirit of the law have not been lived up to, are freely discussed, but nothing new or of es pecial prominence is developed. The President speaks in no still tones of the gigantio crime of Mor monism, but advises and urges the most radical measures looking to its suppression. Civil service reform is fully com mented upon and its practical work ings elucidated. The benefits result ing to the government, the people and their representatives, by civil service examination are clearly eet forlh and abundantly proved. In his conclusion Mr. Arthur ur gently impresses upon Congress the necessity of the rapid crentiou of a navy, of extensive aud sufficient sea coast defences, of the needs of govern mental aid to popular education, of of the great desirability of reciprocal commercial treaties with American nations and a regulation of the tariff looking to this end, as well as to foster our own industries. In this portion of the iu-gn tho President is par ticularly happy and forcible, making his points with Clearness and concisely arguing them to the conclusion. Taken as a whole the document is a very ablo one and refleets great credit upon the brain, heart and patriotism of our present Chief Magistrate. The Associated Press had a dis patch denying the truth of the reports of a wide-spread and fatal disease pre vailing in the mountainous regions of Virginia, Kentucky and West Virgin ia, but now the reports come from the Kentucky side, with such substantiali ty, that it is fearad it is true. The district afflicted appears to be larger than first reported, five or six counties in Kentucky and Virginia and three or four in West Virgiuia being afflict ed. The disease is a peculiarly viru lent form of dysentery. At one lo cation at the bead of Clover creek, in Ilailau county, Kentucky, there were twelve deaths' iu one day. There has been no failure of the crops, but the destitution caused by the 6ick tak ing up the time of the well, so as to prevent the gathering and preparation of food ; the sick and dying being so numerous that the well cannot make coffins and bury the dead fast enongh ; while the streams are so low that the mills on the upper streams are stopped fur want of water. So inaccessible is the region that it is feared no adequate assistance can be reiiderd, and the pis til. -nee will coctiuue uutil it exhausts Another Lie r,v:i-. Two or three prominent Dein. papers have, in their desire to br the force of Mr. Blaiue'it Augu speech, caught .it nn alleged intervi with ex Senator Blanch K. Bruce, Mississippi, in which he is represen 1 as having severely rebuked XIr. Bin' e for having declared that tho coloicd voters at the South are deprived of the right to exercise the suffrage free ly. It was asserted, on tho authority of Mr. Bruce, that the recent election showed that the colored tnen were as free to voto their political convictions and preferences in the Southern States as were any class ef citizens at tho North, aud that Mr. Blaine had been guilty of gross misrepresentation. Testimony such as Mr. Bruce was alleged to have given, although it woufd have beeu by uo means conclu sive, would have gone far to raie a reasonabla doubt in the minds of Re publicans as to the correctness of Mr. Blaine's position. Mr. Bruce is an intelligent and conscientious represen tative of the colored race, and being familial with their political as well as their social coudition, is a competent witness. We did not believe he had given the testimony attributed to him, and, therefore, made no special refer ence to it. Mr. Bruce, however, turns out to be an adverse witness for those Bourbons who have put him upon the stand. Ho has given uo direct testiinocy on either side, but in a dispatch from Indiauapolis, under dale of November 24, he says : "The dispatch from Phil adelphia purporting to be the sub stauce of an interview with me in re gard to Mr. Blaine's Augusta upeech is a pure fabrication, with not a word of truth in it." Iu so fur, then, as Mr. Bruce has said anything, his tes timony is in favor of Mr. Blaine, and he must be set down ns an adverse witness against those who have under taken to break the force of that Au gusta speech. ' . If the test of truth be honestly ap pliedjto the statements of Mr. Blaine they will be found to be literally cor rect. There is no getting away from the fuel that the South has beeu made solidly Democratic through" fraud, vi olence and murder, and that tho Dem ocratic party goes into power as the beneficiary of these crimes against free government. Pittsburgh Com-Gazette. A former resident of this city, wriiing from a Texas town since elec tion, says: '"It has leukod nut here that my brother anil I are Kspubli cans and we may bo forced to leave here. This country is wild over Cleveland's elf ctioti, and wheu I say wild here it means a geueral tear-op. We have be n waited on by commit tees; had an armed mob of 200 at our door at mid-night, and sacret orders have passed resolutions to trade with uo Republicans. If you at the North but knew the true feeling of tha solid South, New York State would have given Blaine a million majority. They mean war, and you have them to whip sure. When it gets to that you may look for me to settle in Western New York, which is heaven to live in compared with this society." Rochester Democrat. ' It is significant that while the suc cessors of thoseiwho revolted against the election of President Lincoln are almost insane with their jubilations over their return to power, they seem to miss the fact, that the Republicans 6how no disposition to follow their ex ample and fight. The Republican party has set many a good example which it would be well the present victors should note down in their pocket memorandum books for future reference aud imitation. devoted to science, meciianitin. en; iLiriiiir. di- moot nnmilArUaak IwnawNinnAr eo fence, inventions and patent ever published JtCvory namUr iltuitiralt'd with splendid nntfravinKa.
