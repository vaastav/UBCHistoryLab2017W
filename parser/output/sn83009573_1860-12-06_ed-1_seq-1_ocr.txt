Millson, of Va., will be the Chairman of the Committee to be raised in pursuance of Mr. Bote ler's resolution. lie is the most conservative of the representatives from his State. No extremist from either section will be placed upon it. All the New Jersey delegation and many of the more con servative Ilepublicans express their willingness to make reasonable concession to the South. It is not, however, believed that any plan of adjustment can be brought forward this session which will command a majority in both Houses of Congress. Time, however, will be gained, as it is thought possible that none of the Southern States, except South Carolina, will retire from the Union while projects of pacification are pending. The Special Committee of last session will again have charge of the subject of the Pacific Railroad. Mr. Curtis is Chairman. The House is proceeding actively to business > having passed three bills to-day in two hours. The discussion in the Senate on the motion to print the President's message was highly exciting, and has had a depressing effect. When Mr. Saulsburv, of Delaware, announced that as Delaware was the first State to come into the Union, so she would be the last to leave it, the crowded galleries alternately applauded and hissed. The presiding officer found it impossible to main tain order. No disposition to compromise difficul ties was expressed in the debate, but on the con trary, the most bitter feeling was exhibited. The House Judiciary Committee had ?. meeting to-day, and had before them additional evidence touching Judge Watrous, of Texas. It is almost certain that the committee wili now recommend his impeachment by the House. It is said that the evidence lately produced is overwhelming against him, and has changed the minds of many who voted against his impeachment in the last Congress. All the clerks in the Departments from South Carolina have arranged to withdraw in a body as soon as South Carolina secedes. 

WASHINGTON, Dee. s. —With a view to relieve the present linancial embarrassments of the Govern ment, Mr. Phelps made a proposition this morning in Committee of Ways and Means, to issue ten mil lion dollars in the form of Treasury notes. The consideration of this proposition was postponed for a short time, as the Secretary of the Treasury's re port on the state of the finances is not yet printed, and the members of the Committee are not yet pre pared to decide on the proper method of relieving the embarrassments of the Treasury. The Speaker will not announce the Special Com mittee on that part of the President's Message re ferring to the secession troubles, until Mondavnext, desiring meanwhile to consult with the members of the different State delegations in order to make the best selections. Edward 11. Reynolds, from New York, elected as the successor of Mr. Burroughs, deceased, qualified and took his seat in the House to-day. The vote on the Homestead bill in that body, was about the same as on that which the President ve toed at the last session, the opposition thereto be ing from the Southern members, including those from the prospectively seceding States. The Putman Phalanx arrived here this evening, and were received by the Washington Light In fantry, and afterward were entertained by Secre tary Toueey. The Nebraska Territorial Legislature 

OMAHA,-N. 1., Dec. 3.—The General Assembly of the Territory convened here at 2 o'clock this af ternoon. The Council elected W. H. Taylor, of Nebraska City, President; E. P. Brewster", Chief Clerk; D.

Leido de Tefada is the favorite candidate in Northern Mexico. The Liberals were investing the capital, and it WM belieyed they bad taken it. THE 1)A ILY EX( tIA AGE. The Political Crisis. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Among the propositions j privately discussed, in reference to the present po | litical troubles, is one looking to the appointment | of a delegation by the conservative members of Congress for the slaveholding States to proceed to the South Carolina Convention with the view of having a conference, and making an appeal to that State to pause in her present movement. The suggestion is made in intelligent circles, that when the Special Committee on Mr. Boteler's reso lution shall have been announced, the influential and conservative men of each State communicate with the member of the Committee therefrom, thus contributing to the extent of their power, to some practicable mode for quieting the present political excitement. Several schemes have already been discussed— one of them is to make an effort to conciliate at least a large majority of the slaveholding and non sjaveholding States, whatever course the extreme States may pursue. Meeting of the Klectornl Colleges.

SERIOUS RAILROAD ACClDENT. —Yesterday morn ing about a quarter-past seven o'clock, a smash-up occurred on the Northern Central Railway, which entailed a loss of some $2,50 C, and severely injured two persons. A burthen train, consisting of be tween twenty and thirty cars, was coming from the Bolton depot. A locomotive, as usual, was at tached to the rear of the cars and thus proceeded towards the Calvert street station. Just after pass ing the curve at the Reservoir, a coupling gave way and fifteen cars which were in front and on which the breaks were not in use, started down the grade. With every yard the velocity increased until they (rained a speed really frightfuL A brakesman named Mclntyre attempted to apply a break, but finding it would not work, at the last moment he jumped from the car, spraining his ankle badlv, but not receiving any serious injury. By the time the train reached the corner of Monument street, the rate of speed was not less than a mile a minute. At this point, the first two cars ran from the main track upon the Monument street track. The third car leaped from the track to the east ward, ran across the street and pavement, entered the marble yard of Mr. Hugh Sisson, mounted on the large blocks of marble, and thence to the roof of the one-storv workshop, striking the corner of the building, knocking the end out. The other cars followed this, one after another, until there was a pile of some ten of them. Some of the cars ran into Monument street, while others kept down North street. Ten of them were crushed, and all of them more or less damaged. The whole scene was a perfect wreck. Their contents were scattered in every direction. Butter, eggs, chickens, geese, flour, potatoes, bar ley, goods, wares and merchandise, lay mingled in one confused mass. On the front cars were two young men, named Oliver Smith, whose parents live at Mount Vernon Factory, and VVm. Thomas Medden, living on Bolton street, near Bolton De pot. The concussion, as the cars leaped from the track, threw them from the platforms, anil they were buried in the ruins. Another young man, named Bernard, of York, Pennsylvania, named Waterman, was in one of the cars", asleep, and it was necessary to cut down the car door to get him out. Policemen Darling, Davidson and Carlisle were soon on the spot, and together with citizens went to work to extricate the men. A few min utes' labor sufficed to reach them, and one, who had a leg broken, was sent to the Infirmarj'. In a few minutes several hun dred people of all ages, classes and sex had as sembled. The "wreckers" went to work, and ar ticles which were scattered about were borne oft' by the thieves. Eggs, butter and poultry suffered most. The police were busy in assisting out the wounded, and could not watch the property, which suffered greatly for a few minutes. The loss of Mr. Hugh Sisson is considerable, lie had a large quantity of finished work standing in the yard, and a number of boxes had just been packed for ship ment to the South. His workshop is so much damaged, that most of it will have to be rebuilt. A lady who was about to cross the street when the runaway cars came down, narrowly escaped in jury. Fortunately none of Mr. Sissoii's hands had commenced work when the accident occurred. All day yesterday a number of men were employed in clearing away the wreck. ARREST ON CHARGE OP VAGRANCY AND HIGHWAY BOBBERY. —George Stine alias Buddy, one of the four Bough Skins who made the dastardly assault on the old man on the Post-Office premises, on the day after the election of Mayor Swann, in 1858, and who was tried and sentenced to the Penitentiary for two years by Judge Giles, was yesterday ar rested on the charge of vagrancy. His term of im prisonment expired about four weeks ago. On being set at large he immediately went to his old haunts on Eastern avenue, between Bethel and Central av enue, where he has been lounging about, doing nothing for bis living, lie was picked up under the vagrant act, when a gentleman named John Slater, a butcher in the Fell's Point market, laid a charge against him of robbing him on the morning of the Mayor's election, on Bond street, near Eastern avenue. At the time referred to, Mr. Sla ter was passing down the street, when Buddy, with three companions, approached him. Buddy grasped him by the right side of his collar, and another of the desperadoes grasped him by the other side, and then Buddy demanded five dollars. Mr. Slater told him that "lie had not that much money. Buddy demanded a dollar, which Mr. Slater gave him. The thief on the other side de manded the same amount, which was handed him. The two behind then made similar demands, and Mr. Slater took all the monev from his pocket and gave it to them. Tbey still "held him, and it was only after much beseeching that they let him go. Mr. Slater turned into an alley and the thieves walked down the street a few steps when thev came to a halt, and divided the money equally, justice Hiss committed Baddy for CO days as'avegrant, and sent the other charge to the Grand Jury. SHOPLIFTING. —Yesterday morning about nine o'clock, a notorious character named Jacob Gra ham, with a companion, entered the clothing es tablishment of Mr. Bonis Kloman, No. 34 Charles street, and asked to be shown some vest patterns. The man in charge of the store told them that Mr. Kloman was net in, and lie could not sell them anything. Tbey ordered him to go for Mr. Klo man, and as he started to the back part of the store for the purpose of ringing a bell, Graham picked up several silk velvet vest patterns, and put them under bis coat. As soon as the clerk observed this, he returned to where the thieves were standing, and was in the act of locking the door to prevent their escape, when the one who is unknown sprung out of the door and startod to run. He was pur" sued by a small boy who stands in the store, and chased as far as the corner of Charles and German streets, where he evaded pursuit. Graham attempt ed to leave also, but the clerk collared him and a tussel ensued. Graham finally succeeded in getting into the street, when a policeman arrived and con" ducted him to the police station, where he had a hearing before Justice Hiss, who committed him to jail for court. On Sunday night two men attempted to force an entrance into Mr. Kloman's store. THE PUTNAM PHALANX—THEIR DEPARTURE.— Yes terday the members of the Phalanx spent the day in visiting different parts of the city, public build ings, etc. At three o'clock in the afternoon Com pany C, of the Baltimore City Guard, under command of Lieutenants Dorsey and Hubbell, pro ceeded from their armory to the Gilmor House, for the purpose of escorting the Phalanx to the Camden street depot. At half past three the visiting battalion formed, and the line of march was taken up. The railroad company liad prepared special cars for the use of the military, and they were drawn up in the rear of the office building. On ar riving at the depot the Phalanx immediately got on board, and in a few minutes they were oil'. As the train started the City Guard gave three cheers, which were responded to by the members of the Phalanx in a hearty manner. The City Guatd re turned to the armory and dismissed. NEGRO SERVANTS OF THE PUTNAM PHALANX.— Upon learning the extent of the feeling which ex isted in our community, growing out of the present disturbed relations of the States on the slavery question, the officers of the Phalanx promptly directed the return ot their free negro servants to the North, and they accordingly left in the morn ing train lor Philadelphia. The prompt action of the -visitors, and the deference to Southern senti ment, was the subject of conversation yesterday. The question discussed in this connection" was as to the application of that section of the law of the State, which authorizes free negroes, as servants, to accompany their masters visiting our State, some of our citizens being of the opinion that the exemption did not apply to the circumstances of this case. 

PROPERTY SALES.— Yesterday, A. C. Matthews, auctioneer, sold, at the Merchant's Exchange sales rooms, a lot ot ground situated on McElderry's wharf, about four hundred feet south of Pratt street, having a front on the wharf of 30 feet, rfild a depth back to Mill street of 50 feet.

CONVENTION OF LAYMEN OF THE HAITI •MOREAND EAST BALTIMORE CONFER ENCES OE THE METHODIST EE! SCO PAL CHURCH. FIRST DAY. A meeting of delegates, consisting entirely of Laymen of the Baltimore, East Baltimore and Philadelphia Conferences of the Methodist Episco pal Church, convened yesterday in the Eutaw Street Church. The meeting was in pursuance of a call published in the "Christian Advocate" on the first of September last. At twelve o'clock, John Summerfield Berry, Esq., arose and stated that, by request of the Com mittee of Arrangements, he would call the meeting to order. He said that body had been convened in pursuance to the following notice, which Mr. Ber ry? read to the Convention: IVnERKAs, The General Conference of the Methodist EpiWopal Church have, by periodical attempts to change the rule on slavery, perpetrated injurious and dangerous agitation in the church, and abetted and sustained it in the political community; and, moreover, did recently so alter the Discipline, as to introduce into it a new article of faith, declaring it to be sin, which God has not pro nounced to be sin; and Whereto. The action not only violated our religious constitution, hut assumed for the church a position hos tile in spirit to the laws of Maryland and Virginia; and lYhereas, It is the right and duty of the lay members of the church in the capacity of Methodists and citizens, to express their opinions and feelings upon this momentous subject; and Whereas, Action lias already been had by several meet ings of the membership and ministers of the church re commending the call of a General Convention. Therefore, Resolved, First— That we earnestly and cordially invite our brethren in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Co lumbia, to meet us in Convention at the city of Baltimore the sth rlay, the lirst Wednesday in December next. Resolved, Second— That the Convention be composed exclusively of laymen, because the object of the Conven tion will be to memorialize the next annual conferences, from whose territory delegates are invited. Resolved, Third— That each circuit and station be here by invited to send as many delegates as it may have effec tive travelling ministers. In accordance with these resolutions, therefore, the Convention was called to order, and opened with religious exercises, the Rev. Thomas Bewail officiating. Mr. Berry then suggested a temporary organiza tion of the Convention, and on motion of Dr. Hen ry Wilson, the Hon. John Armistead Carter, of Virginia, was called to the chair. Mr. Carter,returned thanks for the honor conferred upon him by the Convention, in selecting him as their temporary chairman. He congratulated the body upon such a large attendance of laymen from Maryland and Virginia. He earnestly hoped that all the deliberations and conclusions of the body would tend to build up our common Christianity. On motion then of the Hon. Hugh L. Bond, Mr. J. W. Selbv,of Baltimore, wa9 selected as tempo rary Secretary. The Convention being thus temporarily organized Mr. John S. Berry moved that a Committee on Credentials be appointed by the Chair. The motion was agreed to, and the following members elected : Committee on Credentials. —John S. Berry, Balti more District; William R. Woodward, Washing ton; H. W. Febrey, Potomac; J. R. Bowen, Win chester; Dr. T. J. A. Mowman, Rockingham; D. G. Dowthart, Roanoke; T. A. Moore, Lewisburg; J. M. Lester, East Baltimore; J. S. RichardsoD, Philadelphia.

Cunningham, Rockingham; N. McKenny, Ro anoke; William Watts, Lewisburg; J. H. T. Je rome, East Baltimore; Col. S. Y. Harrison, Phila delphia. After a short absence, Judge Bond reported the following gentlemen as permanent officers : President, Coi. John Summerfield Berry, of Bal timore Conference; Vice Presidents, Dr. G. C. Ty ler, Philadelphia; Samuel McCnbbin, East Balti more; 11. Clagget, Western Va.; Secretaries, J. W. Selby, S. Burnett, Baltimore. The report of the committee having been adopt ed, Mr. Berry took the chair and addressed the body as follows : Brethren of the Convention : I thank you for the distinguished honor you have conferred upon me. We are met as a body of Christian gentlemen—the first Genernl Convention of our Laity which has ever assembled in the United States, to consider subjects of vital importance to us as Methodists. The great purposes we seek to attain are to free the Gospel from the shackles which fetter it in our midst; to open to our preach ers a door of entrance to the people, which, though once open to our fathers, has, by the perpetual agi tation of the slavery question, become almost en tirely closed to them, and to preserve the unity of our conference in the bond of peace. Thet we may effectually accomplish our purposes, it Is necessary that our proceedings be characterized bv great de liberation, Christian forbearance and wisdom, and we should not fail to remember if we would have these to ask them at the hands of our God, and the God of our fathers, "who giveth to all men liber ally and upbraideth not." The Chair then announced that the Convention was readj- for business. On motion of Mr. Moses Walton, it was Resolved, That a Committee, to consist of two members from each Presiding Elder's district represented in this Convention, be selected to take into consideration the action of the late Buffalo General Conference of the -Methodist Episcopal Church upon the subject of slavery, and report by resolution or otherwise. That the members of said Committee be selected by the respective delegations from ibe several Presiding Elders' district—each of said delegations retiring; selecting two of their nnmber, and re porting the names of the same to the Convention. A recess of fifteen minutes was taken by the Con vention, to allow the delegations to meet and se lect delegates to act on the Business Committee. At the expiration of that time the Secretary read the following names, as the committee to prepare business; 

BALTIMORE CONFERENCE. Wiitchester District.— J. R. Bowen, T. Locke, Washington—J. C. Harkness, Dr. F. Howard. Lewisburg—Thomas A. Moore, Hugh L. Bond. Baltimore—Charles J. Baker, Joseph O.

A motion was then made by a member to place the Hon. John Armistead Carter upon the commit tee to act as its chairman. The motion was unani mously carried, notwithstanding Mr. Carter wished the Convention to excuse him. A committee to prepare rules, Ac. for the Gov ernment of the Convention was then appointed, and the Convention adjourned to meet this morn ingatD o'clock. An experience meeting-, composed of a majority of the delegates, was held last night at the church, to interchange views in regard to the condition of the Church in the several conlerences. LA \V INTELLIGENCE. UNITED STATES CIROUn' COURT—JnnoB Gn.ns. John B. Wright, use of Maxwell, Wright & Co., vs. the Bun Mutual Insurance Company, of New York, and same vs. Orient Insurance Company, of New 7 ork. An action to recover from each Com pany one-half of the insurance on the cargo of (he schooner " Marv W.," from Rio de Janeiro to New Orleans, viz : 1.800 bags of coffee, at $lB per bag, the claim against each company being about $10,470. The history of these cases -presents and settles some novel and important questions relating to contracts of insurance upon an open or running policy, which enables a merchant to insure his goods shipped at a distant port, when it is impos sible for him to be advised of the particular ship upon which the goods are laden, and therefore can not name it in the policy. Upon the first trial of these cases, it was assumed that the schooner " Ma ry W." rated below A 2, and the jury,under certain instructions of the Circuit Court, rendered a ver dict for the plaintiff. The defendants excepted, and on an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court (Justice Clifford dissenting) re versed the ruling of the Circuit Court, and say : I "That according to the true'construction of the terms of the policy, where the vessel declared or reported by the assured was rated be low A 2, the company had the right to fix, at the time, the additional premium, and unless assent ed to by the assured, and the premium paid or se cured, the contract of insurance in respect to this particular shipment did not become complete or binding, and directed a new trial. in the trial dc novo, in this court, which commenced Monday, Nov. 26, the fact to be determined was whether the schooner Mary W. rated, or was entitled to rate, below A 2 or not, in New York, at the time of in surance. Evidence as to this point was offered on both sides, and after the conclusion of the argument .yesterday, the jury retired with permission to re turn a sealed verdict in the morning. Brent & May for plaintiff; Brown and Brune, and Hamilton, of New York, for defendants. The U. S. DISTRICT COURT meets this morning at. ten o'clock. SUPERIOR COURT—JUDGE MARTIN.

The accused was placed upon his trial, and the evidence on the part of the State was to the effect that the prisoner had been engaged as a workman in Mr. Median's shop, manufacturing frames, Ac.; that Mr. Median had at various times missed frames and engravings, and suspecting the accused, procured a search warrant and found about a wagon load of frames in his house, some of which answered the description of those lost by Mr. Me dian, while the defence established by persons in the trade the impossibility of identifying such prop erty without a private mark being placed upon them. A large number of witnesses were exam ined, especially by the defence, and the case was argued at considerable length by T. Joseph Rogers and John T. Ensor, Esqs., on the part of the pris oner, and Mr.. Gittings for the State. Jury out. Dunham, garnashces of Dunham & Kerfoot, a new trial was granted and the case remanded to Mar ford county. The Court at 3% o'clock adjourn ed to dine. An afternoon session will be held. COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND. DECEMBER TERM, IB6O.— ANNAPOLIS, Dec. 5, 1860. —No. 164.

Pratt for the appellant. No. 165. State,use of Ignatius Gardner, vs. C. S.Keech, administrator of T.P.Turner. Appeal from the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. This case was argued by Thomas P. Bowie, for the appellant, and Daniel Clarke for the appellee. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE—HOW IT iS RECEIVED. [From the Washington Constitution ] The appeal thus made by Mr. Buchanan to the justice, the patriotism, the wisdom, of the country, will at once bring the issue to a decisive test. If it be not listened to, who else can speak? If it be not acted upon, readily and generously, of what avail will be further talk about forbearance, or further effort to adjust the relations of the two sec tions upon the slavery question? Mr. iiuchanan has discharged his duty in the premises. He has done all that his position allows him to do, by de monstrating the danger and the way of escape.— His responsibility, so far as the case at present stands, is therefore ended. The responsibility of Congress now begins, and upon the promptitude and sagacity of its action the question of Union or no Union altogether depends. [From the. National Intelligencer.] 'lhe chief interest of the present Message will doubtless relate to the President's views on the doctrine of secession. In so far as he discusses this topic in the light of history, reason and constitu tional law, we have marked, in our hasty perusal, little to which we canno't give our full and hearty assent. I From the Philadelphia Inquirer—lndependent ] The anxiety felt by the general public to learn what the President had to say about the disturbed domestic relations of some of the States to the Gen. eral Government, was yesterday relieved by the re ceipt of the annual message to Congress. But be yond the mere satisfaction of having learned his views, no other sensation of relief was The great difficulty is left without any clearlv in dicated remedy. Taking the document as a whole, it is a most remarkable medley, exhibiting the work of a variety of hands, and showing unmistakable signs of having been pieced and patched, elaborated and cut down, to suit the conflicting opinions of different members of the Cabinet. There are passages in which it is direct, forcible and satisfactory, and these are followed by others that are feeble almost to absurdity. It is clear that the President and his advisers did not know what to do with the great question they were forced to deal with. * * * The President has cast the responsibility of extricating the country from dan ger and destruction upon Congress, and to that body the people must now look for the means of peace aqd Union. [From the Phil. Xorth American—Republican.] We do not wish to pronounce upon measures of conciliation in advance of any declaration of senti ment by the body of the Opposition in Congress, but we have no expectation that the only real point in these propositions would ever be ratified as an amendment to the national Constitution. It is a grave matter to open the Constitution again to al teration, and the attempt to do so would produce much, if not dangerous, discussion. The points named are all below the rank of constitutional pro vision, also,whatever their merit. The case is real ly an inadequate one, end it would be as unneces sary as it is inadequate in any other state of the public mind than the present. So much for the Presidential message on the gravest event yet known to our history—a treat ment of the case characteristic of the President we havenow. With much soundness of argument, we have singular inadequacy of results, but we hope that in the brief period vet remaining to the author of this message, we shall have nothing to lament of greater and graver ei .-. [From the Philadelphia Pennsylvania.!*—Breckinridge Democrat. J It remains to be seen bow these recommendations will be received by the country. Such is the tem per of the public mind that no man, however wise, can pronounce upon the effect of anv proposed measure. Human judgment, always fallible, is in the present emergency altogether at fault. If patriotism is not extinct, we may hope for a reac tion at the North which will be generously responded to at the South, and which will result in that con summation so devoutly wished. 1 From Forney's Press] That it ia the best message that has ever proceeded from the Executive, whether from his own pen or from that of his Cabinet we do not say, it would be folly to deny. It is written with vigor and clearness, and that part of it which refers to the existing troubles is certainly presented in a forcible manner. Bat, unfortunately for the President, he has in volved himself in a labyrinth of inconsistencies. His argument against secession, particularly that part of it which is strengthened by his references to the Constitution and Mr. Madison's authority, is overwhelming; and yet, while deprecating revo lution, and denying to' Congress or to the Executive all power to force seceding States back into the Union, his message substantially justifies the Southern States in retiring from the Union. * * * We repeat that secession must end in civil war, and the sooner the public mind settles itself upon this idea the better. A thousand events will pre cipitate a conflict between the States that go out and those that remain in; and it is this apprehen sion daily thickening and darkening upon Congress and the country, that should induce the Cotton States to pause and rally the border States around the Union. [ From the Alexandria ( Fa.) Gazette— Union.] It is that part of the Message which gives the President's views on the subject of Union, Seces sion, and kindred matters, which will excite most public interest. We do not know that upon a careful consideration of all the points made by the President, we shall agree with him in even- par ticular. But we repeat that the tone and spirit of his remarks are conservative, union-loving and pa triotic; and add that if all sections of the country could approach the matters in dispute in the same spirit, the controversy might be settled amicably, and peace and union be restored. [ From the New Fork Herald. ] As the closing regular exhibit of Mr. Buchanan's administration, we had expected a good report, and we should have been disappointed had he failed to meet the sectional discords and dangers of the day with such arguments and recommendations for the preservation and perpetuation of the Union of these States as his position, the occasion and the public expectations demanded. So far, however, from being in any degree disappointed upon these essen tials, we are delighted with the calm, patriotic, consistent and convincing views thereon of this ad mirable annual Message. The last from Mr. Buch anan, it is his best, good as its predecessors have been, each in its adaptation to the requirements of the time. I! From the New York Tribune.{ Let us devoutly thank God that, for the ensuing • four years at least, the people of the United States r are relieved from the annual visitation of a long Presidential lecture wherein reason is insulted, humanity outraged, history travestied ana common sense defied, in the interests of human slavery, and for the interest of its upholders. Whatever evils the future may have in store for us, this one, at least, is for a season intermitted, if not forever put away. [Frcm the New York IFoWtf.] Despite the logical inconsistency between some of v its most important positions, President Buchanan's message 13 A judicious, patriotic, and conciliatory document. In a Mine of great public excitement and peril, like the present, the assertion of doubt ful authority by ttic federal executive would tend to increase the dangerous irritation. Mr. Buchan an has, in this respect, viselv kept on the safe side. [ From the. New Torlc Times.] lhe country has now the benefit of Mr. Buchan an's advice on the political crisis. The Message is out, and discusses the subject at length. The doc ument will scarcely reward the anxiety which has awaited its appearance. There are many things in it which are true, and some which are new; but its true things are not new,nor are its new things true, it is probably the most elaborate effort Mr. Bu chanan has ever made to appear bold without taking any risks, and firm without the necessity of pioviDg his firmness. It is possible that it may tranquilize the country, hut if so, the disturbance of the public peace is much less serious than lias generally been supposed. 

THIRTY-SIXTH CtfNHRESS—SECOND SESSION. SENATE. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The Senate met at noon, and was opened with prayer. Mr. PUGII aii peared in his seat. Mr. HALL moved an order that a number of volumes on the Pacific Railroad be published for the use of tlie Senate. Mr. I'DWI-.LL moved a reference of the President's Message, so far as relates to the present crisis in the political affairs of the country, to Special ! Committee. Mr. 

GREEN introduced a resolu tion that the # Committee on fhe Judiciary bo in structed to inquire into the propriety of providing by law, and establishing an armed police force in the border States, slave and free, for the purpose of maintaining general peace between the States and for preventing the invasion of any of the Status by the citizens of another, and also for the more efheient execution of the Fugitive Slave law. -Mr. CAMERON moved that it be made the order of the day for next Monday; adopted. Mr. LATHAM presented the credentials of Edward D. Baker, of Oregon. Mr. HALE moved to recon sider the vote to print the President's Message.— He said if he understood the message, it first showed that South Carolina had just cause to secede, and secondly, that she has no right to secede. Ho did think the President should hare pointed out to Con gress some rule for the guidance of Congress. He had tailed to look the thing in the face. We must look to the ballot-box or war for the termination of our diffi- { culties. South Carolina asks no council. Sheconsid-j ers disunion a settled question and is arming herself. ! The voice of the majority,as announced at the ballot- j box, would not be submitted to. The Northern States were said to be the aggressors. Gentlemen j on the other side would listen to aspersions of their | fellow-citizens rather than own their convictions. ' We are trying an experiment. Our Republic has not outlived the soldiers who fought her battles and won her victories. We have obtained what wo have by great eftort, at the price, not of revolution, but patriotism. But compar ing with a contest reaching far back in English history, we are coming to the culmi nating point. The civil war of England was in significant to our conflict. 1 hope we shall settle things peaceably, but if we cannot, we must look the danger straight in the face. The South refuses i to submit to the coming administration. Mr. 

BROWN, of Mississippi—lf vou go right we will i go the left and vice versa. -"Mr. IVERSON— The | States withdrawing disclaim further allegiance. We intend to go out of the Union before the fourth of \ March. live States will go out. Arkansas and j Louisiana will call a convention pretty soon. The I Black Republicans intend to use their power to put I down slavery, and our policy is to get out of the j Union while we have strength. Nothing under! heaven carprevent it. Talk about the lepeal of I the personal liberty hills!—that will not prevent j it. We don't fear them much, but We must I dread mob laws. We intend to go out j "peaceably if we can—forcibly if we must." 1 The next twelve months would find a Southern I Confederacy fully established, and in my opinion, the most prosperous and powerful ever "seen. We don't apprehend war, but if the North attempts to coerce, it will come! It' the Senator from New Hampshire wants it, we will give it to him. We are preparing to fight for our liberties, rights and honor. We are not a feeble race of Mexicans, that can he easily overcome. 1 believe wo will have a united people and agree harmoniously. I hope the North will see that it is the best policy to let us go and make treaties of commerce with us rather than attempt to coerce us. We will give them all possible advantages, and both of us will be able to live in the exercise of greater friendship. There is now an enmity between the Northern and South ern people deeper than hell! No one on the other side comes here to exchange courtesies, neither do we go there. We are enemies. Northerners hate the South greater than any other country does. We don't feel the loss of their love, and the sooner we separate the better. The Senator from New- Hampshire had better take care. If war comes, we will meet the myrmidons of the abolitionists. Mr. DAVIS boped they would print the Mes sage, whether good, bad or indilferent. As long as we are in alliance, threats are of no avail.—- Mr. WIGFALL said, no man can deny that the constitutional compact between the States is that each State shall act for itself, and on its own re sponsibility, lie compared the violation of the laws by the States toa'foreign power breaking its treaties with us.- A message from the House was received, informing the Senate that it had passed the bill to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public domain. Mr. WIGFALL continued— If violence is oli'ered to the States ol the South, the people will he called together to declare whether they desire to remain in the Union. If they believe that they will live more happy and prosperous under another Government, they will assert that by forming a Constitution. The more I read the President's Message, the less I comprehend it. I conclude that the President believes that it is impossible to maintain the organization of the Fed eral Courts in South Carolina, or enforce the deci sions of the judicial tribunals; but whether the State secede or not, he has power to collect cus toms there, and has power for holding possession of the forts. I intend introducing, at an early day, a j resolution to ascertain whether an order has gone J from the War Department in reference to the mat- j ter. I believe the President will precipitate the j very measure he seems intending to avoid. It will ! be necessary to put a construction on the Message, j to know what the President intends doing. Alter that, he will urge forbearance no longer. Then we j will trust in the God of battles. Mr. SAULS-i liURV said: It is not my intention to prolong j this unnecessary and most unfortunate debate, j I rise simply to say in the presence of the Repre sentatives of the States of the Union, that my State having been the first to adopt the Federal Constitu tion, will be the last to do any act or countenance j any act calculated, or having a tendency to lead to | a separation of these States. [Applause.] Her j people did and suffered too much—performed too much service in achieving the glorious liberty which we enjoy,and in establishing the Constitution under which we live. No son of hers will raise his hands against our institutions or against the Union. When this Union shall be d'estroj'ed by the madness or folly of others, if unfortunately it should be, it will be time enough then for Delaware and her representatives to say what ber course will be. [Loud applause from the densely crowded galleries.] The report of the Secretary of State was read by its title. It is the fiscal statement of the contingent expenses of the j State Department. Mr. 

HAMLIN moved, and! the Senate adjourned at half-past 2 o'clock. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee on W ays and Means, reported a bill making appropriations for the payment of invalid and other pensions, and a bill for the support of the West Point Academy. Referred to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union- The House by a vote of C 8 against 125, refused to lay on the table Mr. Grow's motion to reconsider the vote by which the Com mittee of Agriculture on the Homestead bill was last session referred to the Committeeof the Whole on the State of the Union. The House then re considered the vote on the bill thus brought up for action. Mr. GROW said he did not desire to dis cuss this measure, the principle involved having been familiar to the country for the past ten years. This bill, however, avoids the prominent objections in President Buchanan's veto message. It does not propose to donate lands, but it requires a payment of ten dollars for 160 acres. He might, if necessary, quote President Jackson against President Buchanan to show that the former was of the opin ion that the public lands should not be a source of fedeal revenue. He concluded by moving the previous question, under the operation of which the bill was passed—yeas 132, nays TO. Mr. 

COLFAX moved that the Post Route bill returned from the Senate at the former session with amendments, be referred to the Post Office Committee. He remarked that there had been no such bill passed for the last three years, and it was desirions to have action upon it as soon as possible. Mr. SMITH, of Virginia, objected, saying the Government is financially em barrassed.-^—Mr. COLFAX—That's true, but we draw our pay. He had performed his duty as to this matter, and he said, in conclusion, that there were several reforms proposed in the bill, and the Post Master General was anxious to know the dis position of Congress as to the contracts with rail roads. The objections to taking up and refer ring the bill were persisted in. On motion of Mr. SHERMAN the House went into Committe of the Whole on the State of the Union, Mr. Washburn, of Illinois, in tbo chair, and took up the Military Academy bill. Mr. CURTIS offered an amend ment providing that the study of the cadets shall not be extended beyond four years. After a debate the amendment was rejected. The pension bill was read, and this with the academy bill was sub sequently passed. Mr. SHERMAN offered a series of resolutions referring the various branches of the President's message to the appropriate Standing Committees. At 2 o'clock the House adjourned. FEARFUL EFFECTS OF RUM DRINKING. —The Pater sou (N. J.) Guardian says that a Mrs. Hickman, of that city, who kept a low hole, and Irish boarders when she could obtain them, had an Irishman with her who had not been to work recently owing to an inflammation of the lungs. She had also two children, a bov and a girl, aged 14 and 12 years respectively. On Thursday night they were noisy after shutting up, and on Friday morning the neighbors wondered they did not appear. About noon the door was broken open, and one man was found dead, and four other persons were unable to speak. The place was badly ventilated, and the gas from the stove had suffocated the persons while asleep. The woman and the little girl were not ex pected to live, whiie the boy and boarder were somewhat recovered. The place is described as filthy in the extreme. 

STOPPING WORK. —The Hartford Time* hears of large establishments reducing work which it might not be proper now to name. In Bridgeport up wards of 1,000 employees are out of work,and in New Haven 2,000. Dunbar's Hoop Skirt Factory, at Bristol, has stopped. The Plantation Hoe Co. and the Southern Carriage Co., both of Winsted, have had large Southern orders countermanded. The stoppage of the Birmingham Iron and Steel Works is the worst blow to that village which Birming ham has ever experienced. In the vote cast in the Cleneral Assembly of Georgia for electors to cast the votes of Georgia for President and Vice President of the United States, we find recorded the following: For President of Southern Confederacy, R.Barnwell Rhett, of South Carolina, 1. For President of Southern United States, Edmund Ruftin, of Vir ginia, 1. j 

TUURI.OW WEED'S compromise programme is as follows: 1. A more effective, but less obnoxious fugitive slave law to be passed by Congress. 2. In case of forcible rescue of fugitives, counties where such rescue should take place to pay the money value thereof. And 3. All the territories South of 3G deg. 30 min. to be open to the "peculiar institu tion." Fifty more workmen were discharged from the navy-yard at Gosport, on Saturday last. The Louisville papers do not credit the story of the insurection at Columbia. REPORT OP Till: SECRETARY OP THE NAVY. NAVY DEPARTMENT, 1 December, 1800. J Sir—ln pursuance of the provision contained in the naval appropriation act of June 22, 1860,1 appointed a hoard of officers, consisting of Commodore George W. Store, Commodore S. li. Stringham, John Lenthall, Naval Constructor and Chief of the Bureau of Construc tion,A:c, Samuel Arch bo Id, Engineer in Chief, B. F. Isherwood, Chief Engineer, and B. F. Defend, Naval Constructor, to examine the sailing ships of the navy in order to determine the expediency of converting them into efficient war steamers. The brigs, sloops, and fri gates then at sea have not been inspected by them, hut as they found by the record of the department that in form, dimensions, age, and condition, these were similar to those they had examined, they included all in the same opini 11. The sesult of their report is, that it is not expedient to introduce steam power into the brigs, sloops and frigates, hut that it is expedient to introduce it into these ships of the line, except the Delaware, now too de fective to permit it, and by razeeing them to convert them into first class steam frigates. While the present steam frigates ef the Minnesota class, carrying mixed batteries of eight and nine inch guns, forty in number cost en an average $725,000 each, the cost of converting these eight line-of-battlc ships into steam frigates of the same class would averge but $383,000, and when thus converted they would, in the opinion of the hoard, be efficient steamships of war. of full steam power. Of the sailing frigates, the United States is not worth repairing, fhe Constitution has been thoroughly re paired, and would last many years at the Naval Acade my, where she is now stationed. The Sabine and Santo* are comparatively new, and can be used as frigates. The remaining six. as they shall require repairs, should he converted into sloops-of-war, and finally into store ships, and as such would be useful for stores and for protection in various foreign ports. The slnops-of war built prior to 1840, nnd Hie brigs Hain britlge, Perry and Dolphin, require sueli an expenditure to keep them fit for service that it will soon be advanta geous to replace them with new vessels. They are not large enough for store ships. The seven steam frigates, with the exception of the Franklin, are now afloat, and are receiving repairs that will tit them for any service. Nn steam machinery has been built for the Franklin, and the engines of the Merri mack should be renewed. Of the six new steam sloops-ofwar of tlie first class, five are at sea, and their performance has been satisfacto ry. The other, the Pensaeola, will soon he completed. I Of the side-wheel steamers of the first class, the Sus quehanna, Saranac and Powhatan can, by introducing | screw propulsion, be made efficient and economical war 1 steamers. The other, the M.aMaaippi, w;n bo worm no I more repairs than she is now receiving. • Of the new steam %loops-of war of the second class, four, i mounting each two eleven inch guns, have been eminent J ly successful. Two of the others, mounting each one eleven-inch gun, are of less draught, and their perform- I ance at sea has not been equal to that of the larger ves j sels. Another of these smaller steamers, mounting eight j nine inch guns, is expected in port, and will he prepared for a more perfect trial. The Pocahontas has been remod j eled and provided with a new engine, and is an efficient vessel. The five screw steamers of the third class, recently char j tered and then purchased, are performing very efficient i service on the coasts of Africa and Cuba, and are in every respect useful vessels. At the end of their present cruises they will require some repairs and probably new boil ers. The five side-wheel steamers of the small class are use ful and efficient in peace and as dispatch vessels in war, but no side-wheel steamer can be efficient as a war steamer. 

INCREASE IX THE NAVY. While it is the dictate of sound policy to increase the j efficiency of our present ships of war, it is equally so to ; increase their number. i POLICY OF SUSPENDING REPAIRS, i The policy which has been pursued by Congress since l the commercial revulsion of 1857 of curtailing appropria tions for naval repairs, and suspending improvements in ! iwc navy yards, can be vindicated only as a temporary modification of our general policy, to be continued no I longer than the present depletion of the treasury shall I continue. If Congress conld by law arrest the march of ; intellect on one hand and the process of decay on the other, it might do better for government to stand still.— t B,lt at '•} tirat? of incessant activity beyond all past ages, | the nation which should pursue this stand-still policy' ; would soon find itself unfortunately in the lurch —far, far behind all others. It is impossible to maintain the posi j tion of security and respect we now have among the i Powers of the world, if we permit that great arm of de- I fence, by which principally our power would he felt to ; fall into neglect and decay. ! 

NAVY YARDS. I have presented an estimate made by the Chief of the j I* ireau of Yards end Docks, and to be found in his ac j company ing report, of the expenditure which will be ne i cessary to carry forward improvements in the navy I yards, provided Congress shall deem it expedient to re sume its former policy, and to prosecute it during the j next fiscal year. ! NAVAL ACADEMY, j Tlie Naval Academy, under the superintendence of Captain George S. Blake, is in admirable condition. \ Twenty-five acting midshipmen graduated in dune- one hundred and thirty five were permitted to he examined; j thirty-six failed to present themselves or were found dis'- I qualified, and ninety nine were examined and admitted j The measure adopted a year ago of placing the fourth class on board tlie sloop-nt'-war Plymouth, attached to the | academy, has proved entirely successful. I have caused the frigate Constitution to he substituted for the Ply mouth, to be anchored in the harbor of Annapolis for the | accommodation of tlie fourth class. The historic recol lections associated with this ship will exert a salutary i fluence on the minds of youth devoting themselves to the | naval service. It accommodates all the sections of the , fourth class with study and recitation rooms, and the ollicers and acting midshipmen, and the crew of the ship, j with sleeping and mess apartments, j A Board of Officers, consisting or Commodore E. A F. I I.avallette, Captain IVm. M. Giendy, Captain Cadwalader Ringgold, Commander Cicero Price, and Commander Wil liam Rogers Taylor, was appointed in May, to witness the examination of tlie classes of acting midshipmen, and to inquire into the state of the police discipline and general management of tlie academy. They have made a favorable report on all the subjects submitted to them. On their arrival at Annapolis, tlie fourtli class had alrea dy been examined, to hasten their departure in the prae tieeship. The first, second, and third classes were ex amined in the presence of the Board, and made a most gratifying exhibition of their acquirements in the acinic mic studies, and tlie practical exercises of gunnery, field artillery, infantry tactics, and broad and small swords.— The Board observed with pleasure the progressive ad vancement in professional acquirements from tlie lower to the higher classes, and particularly tlie proficiency of the graduating class, which has left tlie institution with a groundwork of professional education promising great future usefulness to tlie navy and to the country. The police and discipline or ihe Institution liuve been most carefully preserved. The records show- a gradual diminution of the number found deficient at tlie examina tion since 1855. In that year those found deficient were twenty-tliree per cent, ol the whole number; in 1856, nineteen and a half per cent; in 185", eighteen and a half per cent.; in 1858, fifteen and a half per cent; in 181.9, fourteen and a half per cent., and for the first half of 1860, ten percent. Tlie grounds, public buildings, and apparatus,are in excellent order, with the exception of the wooden structure covering the gun battery and maga zine, which is insecure and should be renewed. Tlie plan of keeping a ship permanently attached to the academy as a home for the fourth class, is highly approved as a valuable addition to the means of instruction as well as accommodation. The Board of Officers record Iheir high appreciation of the services of tlie superintendent and his associates, and say that tlie institution has prospered in their hands, and provides for tiie navy a high standard of general aud professional knowledge. I concur in these views. Tlie practice ship Plymouth, Commander Thomas T Craven, left Norfolk. June 27th, with one hundred and seventeen acting midshipmen onboard, to make her an nual cruise. She visited tlie ports of Fayal, Cadiz, Fun chal, in Madeira, and Santa Cruz, in Teneritfe, returned to Hampton Roads on the 3d Sept., and spent tlie remain der of that montli in various manoeuvres for instructions in Chesapeake Bay. Commander Craven commends the proficiency of the first class in navigation and seamanship. This class nav igated tlie ship from Teneriffe to Hampton Roads, per forming with accuracy the duties of watch officers. Their observations for ascertaining the position of the ship were so reliable that Commander Craven felt perfect con fidence in the correctness of their work. He perceived a very great improvement in the third class of tiiis year over that of the former year, arising from their having been, during the last academic year, so thoroughly drilled on board the school ship. He says: ' The very great advantages obtained by tiie junior or third class over the first class in practical seamanship, and their very superior efficiency and usefulness when prompt assist&nce was required in tlie management of the sails, yards, &c., exhibited itself in a remarkable degree." 

AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. During the past year the suppression of the African slave trade has received attention, and the work has been prosecuted with vigor. The following vessels engaged in the traffic have been captured and sent in for adjudication, namely; the brig Delicia, captured December 21,1859, by the sloop of-warConstellation,Captain John S. Nicholas, offCabenda, on the coast of Africa, and sent into Charles ton; brigatine Virginian,captured in Congo river Febru ary 6, 1860, by the sloop of-war Portsmouth, Commander John Calhoun, and sent into Norfolk; barque Wildfire, captured in the Old Bahama channel, April 26, 1860, by the V. S. steamer Mohawk, Lieutenant Commanding T. A.M.Craven,and sent into Key West with her cargo of five hundred and thirty Africans, of whom five hundred and seven were delivered to the Marshal; brig Faimonth. captured off Porto Praya, May 6,1560, by tlie sloop-of-war Portsmouth, Commander John Calhoun, and sent into New York; barque William, captured off tlie coast of Cu ha, May 9,1860, by the U. S. steamer Wyandotte, Lieu tenant Commanding Fabius Stanley, and sent into Key West;with her cargo of five hundred and seventy Africans, of whom five hundred and thirteen were delivered to the Marshal; the Bogota, captured off tlie coast of Cuba, May 23,1860, by the U. S. steamer Crusader, Lieutenant com manding John N. Maffit, and sent into Key West with her cargo of five hundred Africans, of whom four hundred and eleven were delivered to tlie Marshal; brig Thomas Achorn, captured June 29, 1860, bv the C. S, steamer Mystic, Lieutenant commanding William E. Leßoy. at Kebemla, on the coast of Africa, and sent into New York; brig Triton, eaptured July 16,1860, by the United States steamer Mystic, Lieutenant commanding Wm. E. Leßoy, on the west coast of Africa, and sent into Norfolk; tiie William Kibby, captured July 2-3, 1860, by the U. S. steamer Crusader, Lieutenant commanding John N. Maf fit, off the coast of Cuba, and sent into New York, with three African hoys on board; ship Erie, captured August 8, 1860, by the steam sloop-of-war Mohican, Commander Sylvanus W. Gordon, off Congo river, anil sent to New York, after having proceeded to Monrovia with her cargo of eight hundred and ninety-seven Africans, and delivered the survivors, eight hundred and sixty-seven in number, into the hands of the United States agent at that place; brig Storm King, eaptured August S, 1860, l>y the United States steamer San Jacinto, C'apt. T. A. Dor nin, off the Congo river, and sent into Norfolk, having first proceeded t'j Monrovia with *i\- hundred find nine teen captured Africans on board, and delivered six hun dred and sixteen, who survived, to the United States agent at that brig of unknown name, captured August 14,1560, by* the United States steamer Crusader, Lieutenant commanding John X. Maffitt, off the coast of Cuba, and sent to Key West. Of these, seven slavers having on board sixteen hundred and three Africans, were captured by the purchased steamer chartered for the Paraguay expedition. The whole number of vessels captured during the past year is twelve; the whole num ber of Africans rescued is three thousand one hundred and nineteen. While the government has been thus active in its en deavors to suppress the African coast slave-trade, and in the last three years has been successful in capturing more slavers than at any former period, yet it is obvious that it can be broken up in two modes only. Cuba is now the only mart in the world open to this trade. If Great Bri- < tain should enforce the provisions of her treaty with Spain of September 23, lsi7. by which, for the consideration of i two millions of dollars paid her by Great Britain, Spain stipulated to abolish the slave trade between Africa and i Cuba, it would lie effectually suppressed. If Cuba were ] to pass under the Constitution of the United States by an nexation, the trade would then also be effectually sup ! pressed; and in either case both the United States and Great Britain would be spared the large expenditure of i treasure and life to which they are now subjected to main : tain their present squadron on the coast of Cuba. 

PATENTED ARTICLES. j The provision in the act of June 23,1860, which prohib ( its the purchase of patented articles for the use of the ! army and navy will be found injurious to the latter ser vice. Since the introduction of steam to propel ships-of- ! war, a great variety of patented articles have, in the con- 1 struction and repair of a steamship, become of daily use, and in many cases of indispensable necessity. Patented 1 boilers, surface condensers, friction thrusts, governors or '■ speed regulators, steam pump?, capstans, air-ports, boat detachers, galleys or cooking stoves, ventilators, steering 1 apparatus, lanterns, logs and leads, vulcanized rubber, salinometers, counters, hydraulic jacks, water gauges,and many tools for manufacturing machinery, and driving and drawing bolts, are of this description. And what is 1 true of the steam machinery is also in some measure true 1 of the armament. 1 A war steamer built now, according to the fashion of 1 the past, excluding all modern patented improvements, ( would be an antiquated object, far behind the present 1 age, and as insufficient as it would be antiquated. The best modern patented improved boiler will make a saving of 18 per cent, of steam. To dispense with all patented surface condensers would be wanton extravagance. To < arm a ship of war without a modern patented invention, i would give great advantage to the enemy. To prohibit the sailor tlie use of his seamless pea-jacket and cap, < would be to deprive liim of the comfort of some of his light, warm, most durable and cheap and nearly water proof clothing. To withhold fmm him the use of Ameri can patented desicated vegetables, would take from him - a portion of his most nutritious and acceptable food. It < is impossible to build, equip, arm and provide a steam : ship of war having anything like usual modern efficiency i without trespassing on all sides upon modern patented improvements. Something also is due to the inventive genius of our countrymen. It is within the memory of < the living when the great inventions aud discoveries, : which have almost revolutionized the world were un ; known. i 

MARINE CORPS, SURGEONS AND PAYMASTERS. 1 I have heretofore reported minutely the condition of the Marine Corps, and of the Medical and Pay De partments of the 'Navy, and have recommended that they be increased, and be made adequate to the wants of the I service. i .... „ „ SQUADRONS. lie Home Squadron has rluiing tha past year been under the command or flag officer Joseph R Jams. He was appointed in May last, on the detachment of flag olli cer u in. .1. McCluney, detached on account of ill health, and having hcen on the station two years, in command of the sloop of war Savannah, he requested to he relieved and in October was succeeded by flag oflicer C J. Render' grast. The squadron, in the course of the year, has in eluded flag ship Savannah, Captain Jos. R. J.trvis; the steam frigate Roanoke, Captain IV. 11. Gardner; the steam sloop Powhattan, Captain Samuel Mercer; the steam sloop Susquehanna Captain George X. Ilollins, which has pro ceeded to the Mediterranean; the frigate Sabine, Captain Henry A. A dams; the steamer Brooklyn, Captain J). (J. Farragut, succeeded by Captain William S. Walker; the sloop-of-war Jamestown, Commander C. H. A. if. Kenne dy; Saratoga, Commander Thomas Turner; and St. Louis, Commander Charles IT. Poor; steamer Pocahon tas, Commander Samuel F. Hazard; sloop-of-war Preble, Commander Thornton A. Jenkins; steam sloop law nee, Commander Henry J. Hartstenc; the steamer Mohawk, Lieutenant commanding T. A. M. Craven; Water Witch, Lieutenant commanding L. C. Sartori; Wvandotte. Lieutenant commanding Fabius Stanly, and Crusader, lieutenant commanding John X. Maffit. and the sloop falmouth, Lieutenant commanding A. 11. Berryman, sue ceeded by Lieutenant commanding 'Charles Thomas, which is permanently stationed at Aspinwall as a store ship, and is armed and provided to furnish protection to our citizens. The Jamestown returned home in Febru ary; the Roanoke in May; the Saratoga in June; the Pre ble and M ater Witch in September, and the Savannah in November. The storcship Relief, Commander Benjamin M. Hove; Supply, Commander Henry Walke, and Release, j Lieutenant commanding George W. Harrison, have been j more or less employed in connection with this squadron The sloop-of war Cumberland, Captain John Mars ton is on the eve of sailing from New York for Vera Cruz, to be the flag ship of Flag Officer IVndergrast; and the sloop of-war Macedonian is fitting at Portsmouth, N*. 11., to join the squadron. The Sabine has been most of the time be fore Aspinwall. She has recently, by order of the De partment, appeared before VeraCruz. The Mohawk, Wyandotte, Crusader and Water Witch, have been era ployed on the coast of Cuba. The Water Witch, yellow fever having appeared on board, returned in September to Philadelphia. The Brooklyn has recently been en gaged 011 special service in connection with the Chiriqui surveying expedition. She lrad previously been at Vera Cruz, and had in January afforded Mr. McLane, United States Minister to Mexico, a passage from that port to New Orleans; i* March from Norfolk to Vera Cruz, and in July from Vera Cruz to Mobile bay. In August she sailed from Norfolk with the Chiriqui Commission. The St Lnnis was emnloved on the cvntmi American coast until June, when she proceeded on a cruise to the eastward, and successively visited Carthagena, St. Do mingo city. La Guayra, Curacoa and Rio Hache. On the arrival of the St. Louis at Curacoa, Mr. Da vies, U. S Consul at Rio Hache, who fled from his consulate for safety, complained to Commander Poor of the treatrrent he had received from the revolutionary troops of >ew Granada. Commander Poor promptly gave him a pass • e in the St. I.ouis to Rio Hache, and on arriving at tnat port, proceeded to investigate the difficulty, demanded an explanation of the indignities offered to the American flag, and required that the flag should be hoisted at the flagstaff of the consulate, and saluted bv the troops. It was accordingly done. The treatment received from the troops by Mr. Davies having resulted principally from bis individual acts, and not from those or an official char acter, Commander Poor remonstrated and proceeded no further. Leaving the consulate in charge of Mr. Meyers he sailed Sept mber 18th for Pensacola,and thence to Vera Cruz. The Saratoga has been stationed mo9t of the time before Vera Cruz. In March she captured the steamers Miramon and the Marques de la Habana, which had been purchased by Miramon for the siege of VeraCruz. A full report of the capture was made to Congress at its last session. She returned to Philadelphia in June last, and was put out of commission. In the month of June Lieutenant commanding Maflitt, of the Crusader, rescued the French bark "Solide," with 450 coolies on board, from her perilous condition on the rocks of Gay Verde, for which he received the thanks of the French Government. In July, Lieutenant commanding Craven, of the Mo hawk, endeavored to save the Spanish brig Bella, which was wrecked on Ginger Cay, and afterwards took her passengers, crew, and part of her cargo into Matanzas, for which he received the thanks of the Captain General of Cuba and other Spanish authorities. The capture of five slavers, and the rescue of 1.603 Af ricans on board of them, are due to this squadron to that part of it employed on the coast of Cuba. The Brazil squadron, under the command of flag officer Joshua R. Sands, has consisted of the frigate Congress (the flag ship,) Captain Louis M. Goldsborough, the steam sloop Seminole, Commander George A. Prentiss, succeeded by Commander E. R. Thomson; the brig Dol phin, Commander Charles Steedman; brig Perry, Lieute nant Commanding Richard J,. Tilghman; brig Bainbridge, Lieutenant Commanding Maxwell Woodhull, and the' steamer Pulaski, Lieutenant Commanding William H. Macomb. The Perry returned home in June, and the Bainbridge in November. The Dolphin has been ordered home. The Seminole sailed from Norfolk for the station July 16. The vessels of this squadron have visited the principal commercial ports on the coast and in the waters of the La Plata, and have given effectual protection to our coun try men and their interests. In the month of June, flag officer Sands, in the United States steamer Pulaski, proceeded from MaUlonado to Buenos Ay res, and with Consul Hudson passed up the t riigua v to Conception, the port of St. Jose, the residence of General Urquiza, by whom they were most cordially welcomed. Returning, flag officer Sands tendered to Gen. Urquiza, his family, st iff, escorts and servants, forty persons in number, a conveyance to Buenos Ayres. Near the mouth of the river they were joined by General Dur kee, the President of the Confederation, and all the for eign ministers, including the United States Minister, Gen eral Cushman. After participating in the grand demon stration made on the return ot the Province of Bueno9 Ayres lo the great confederation, flag officer Sands pro ceeded with the Pulaski to Maldonado, and rejoined the i Congress. The Mediterranean Squadron is commanded by flag offi ! cer Charles 11. Bell. In the course of the year the steam frigate Wabash, Captain Samuel Barron; the sloop of war Macedonian, Cant. N. P. Levy; the steam sloops Susque hanna, Captain George N. Hoiiins, the Richmond, Capt. Duncan N. Ingrahani, and the Iroquois, Commander Jas. S. Palmer, have been attached to it. In December, 1559, j flag officer Lavalette returned with the Wabash to New \ ork. Captain N. P. Levy was left the senior officer pre sent, and on the 21st of February, by order of the depart ment, assumed command as flag officer of the squad ron. The Macedonian returned to the United States in July. The Iroquois sailed from New York January 19th, the ■Susquehanna August 24th, and the Richmond from Nor folk October 13th. The Susquehanna was ordered to Vera Cruz, and temporarily attached to the Home Squadron. She sailed for the Mediterranean in the latter part of October. The Iroquois, in February visited Tetuan and Tangier, on the coast of Morocco. .She thence proceeded to the coasts of Italy and Sicily, where she has since been em ployed. During the bombardment of Palermo she afforded protection to American citizens at that port. The storeship Release, Lieutenant commanding J. M. Frailey, sailed from Boston in October for the McditerrV nean, with stores for the squadron and contributions for the sufferers in Syria. Instructions were given that these charitable contributions should he sent from Spezia to Beyrout by the Release, or by one of the steamers of the squadron which had been ordered to the coast of Syria. The African squadron, under the command of Flag of ficer William In man, has consisted of the steam sloop San Jacinto, Capt. W. M. Armstrong, now commanded by Captain T. A. Dornin; the sloop of war Constellation, Captain J. S. Nicholas; sloop-of-war Portsmouth, Com raar.der John Calhoun; sloop of war Vinconnes, Comman der Ben.j. J. Totten; sloop of war Marion, Commander Thos. W. Brent; steam sloop Mohican, Commander Svl vanus W. Gordon; sloop-of war Saratoga, Command, r AI fied Taylor; the steamer Snmpter, Lieutenant command ing James F. Armstrong, and the steamer Mystic. Lieu tenant commanding William K. Loßoy. The \ inc-run s returned to the United States in March and the Marion in October. The Mohican sailed from New York January 19th to join the squadron, and the Saratoga from Phil,a delphia November 15th. The San Jacinto was sent to Cadiz to he docked and re paired, and was there from March until June. The work was executed well and economically. Every facility that the government yard and docks at the naval arsenal near Cadiz could afford was courteously extended by the Captain General of Marine. The American bark Orion was captured by the British steamer Pluto, in the fall of 1869, near the Congo, with about 800 Africans on board, and taken to St. Helena.— Under the 10th article of the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, Hag officer Inmao applied to the government of St. Helena to deliver the captain, officers and crew to Lieutenant Win. E. I.eßoy, commanding the Mystic. Thomas Morgan, captain, and William Denning and Bryson I. Chamberlain, mates of the Orion, were ac cordingly surrendered, taken to St. Paul in the Mystic, transferred to the Vincennes, and on her return conveyed to Boston for trial. In March, I*6o, Commander Brent, commanding the sloop-of-war Marion, was instrumental in saving from destruction the property of American residents at Kisern bo, on the west coast of Africa. On the first of the month they applied to him to send a sufficient force on shore to guard their factories, apprehending they would be de stroyed by the natives.who meditated an attack upon the Portuguese at that plaee. Commander Brent promptly responded to the call, proceeded on shore with several of the officers of the Marion and forty sailors and marines, established a guard at the factories, maintained until the next morning, and then returned to the ship. On the 3d a-signal was made from the shore for assistance, and Commander Brent immediately landed a force of fifty sailors and marines, with a howitzer and small-arms.— During the day the Portuguese and natives were engaged in conflict, and several attempts were made by the na tives to approach the factories to fire them, but were thwarted by the guard under Commander Brent. The next morning the detachment returned to the ship, as no further danger was apprehended. Commander Brent ob served a strict neutrality throughout, his only object be ing the protection of American citizens. The force under his command co operated with a similar one under Commander Fitzroy, of the British steamer Falcon, who interfered at the request of the English residents. The squadron has captured during the past year seven slavers on the African coast, and rescued fifteen hundred and sixteen Africans found on hoard of them. Tlie Pacific squadron, under the command of Flag Offi cer J. B. Montgomery, has consisted of the steam sloop of-war Lancaster, the flag ship, Captain John Rudd; the steam sloop Saranac, Captain Robert Ritchie; the sloop of-war Cyane, Commander Samuel Lockwood; sloop-of war Levant, Commander William E.Hunt; sloop-of-war St. Mary's, Commander William D.Porter; sloop-of-war Vandalia, Commander Arthur Sinclair; steam frigate Merrimac, Commander Robert B. Hitchcock; steam sloop Wyoming, Commander John R. Mitchell; steam sloop Narragansett, Commander Timothy A. Hunt; store ship Fredon ia, Lieutenant commanding James M. Watson, stationed at Valparaiso; and the storeship Warren, Lieut enant commanding Junius J. Boyle, stationed at Panama, both the latter ships being armed and provided for de fpnro nf Amprienn riti*pna Thp Vandalia r*tnrnPC! tn the United States in January last, and the Merrimac in February. The steamer Narragansett sailed from Nor folk March 31st, arrived at Valparaiso August 4th. and proceeded thence to Callao, to Guayaquil (with Consul C'assanova), and to Panama. The I.ancaster arrived at Panama December 6th, 1859. Early in April she proceeded along the Mexican and Cen tral American coasts, visiting San Juan del Sur, Realejo, La Union, Acapulco, Mazatlan, Guayamas and La Paz, and in July returned to Panama. In August flag officer Montgomery visited in his flag ship the port of Callao, at the request of our Minister to Peru. In consequence of his unexpected departure, orders from the Department to remain before Panama did not reach him until after his , arrival at Callao. She remained at Callao until October, when she returned to Panama. The officers and crew of the Saranac, at the expiration of a two years' cruise, were relieved by others sent to Pa nama, Captain Ritchie relieving Captain Kelly in the command in November, 1559. From that time until July, 186'), she was on the Central American coast, and then proceeded to the Navy Yard at Mare Island, for re pairs. The Cyane, having been on the coast of Nicaragua for some months, was, in January, ordered to Panama, and in March to Mare Island, for repairs. Tn June she pro ceeded to the Gulf of California, to supply the place of the St. Marvs. The Levant sailed In January from Panama for Reale jo, and relieved the Saranac. Returning in May, she was dispatched to the Sandwich Islands, at the request of the Secretary of State, to inquire into the expenditure of the fund appropriated for the relief of destitute American seamen. Having performed this duty, Commander Hunt has probably returned with her to Panama. The Wyoming arrived at Panama March 27, having touched at Valparaiso, Callao and Guayaquil. In April she relieved the Levant on the Coast of Nicaragua. In May she was dispatched from Panama to Callao. with im portant instructions from the Department of State to the U. S. Minister at Peru. The St. Marys was stationed on the western coast of Mexico from October, 1859, until ordered to Panama, where she arrived in July, 1860. At the insurrection in the vicinity of Panama, which occurred September 27, a brisk tire was commenced from the outskirts of the city, killing six and wounding three of the white inhabitants Commander Porter immediately went on shore, consulted the American Consul, and at tlio request of the Military Intendent, and of the agent of the railroad, landed a body of sailors and marines, and a field piece, and,took posses sion of the railroad station. On the 28th, the Governor delivered up the city to the joint occupancy of the forces from the St. Marys and the British ship Clio. Tranquilli ty having been restored, the detachment, on the 7th of October, was withdrawn. Lieutenant Commanding Junius J. Poyle, of the War ren, rendered active service on this occasion. The East India squadron lias been commanded by flag officer C. K Stribling, and has comj.: ed the steam sloop of war Hartford, the flagship, Capt, Charles Lowndes; sloop of war Germantown, Commander R. L. Page; stea mer Saginaw, Commander James F. Sclienck; steam sloop Dacotah, Commander William Radford; and sloop-of war John Adams, Commander John M. Berrien. The sloop of war Vandalia, Commander S. Phillips Lee, is about to sail from New York for this station. The John Adams sailed from Norfolk June 1,1859, and after many delays arrived at nong Kong April 28,1560. The Saginaw sailed from San Francisco March 12, and arrived at Shanghae May 12. The Dacotah sailed from Norfolk June 30, and has probably arrived on her station. The Germantoyfn returned to the United States in April.

EXPLORATION'S. The act of Congress of June 22,1860, authorized the J resident to send some competent person or persons to ic Isthmus of Chit iqui, to examine and renort upon the quuhty and probable quantity of coal to be found on the Tntpr nf 11 v binqui Improvement Company: the char nracticalJHtv ? r3 'i°J ,U -V '•' , 8"" n and Golflta: the practicability of building a railroad across the Isthmus, llmin. 0 Connec ß? ld "'arbors. I transmit herewith pre .minary reports from Capt. Engle, Lieutenants Jeffers and Morton, and Pr. Evans. These reports show that the harbors on both sides of the isthmus of Chiriqui are unsurpassed; that, in the opinion of Lieutenant Morton, it is entirely practicable to connect the harbors by a line or railroad adapted to commercial purposes, " and that the coal found there is of excellent quality and the sup ply inexhaustible. 1 he exploration of the Parana and of the tributaries of the Paraguay, under the command of Commodore Thos. J. Page, has probably been completed. lie had reached I ruguayana in August last. It was his intention to ex tend the exploration in the Uruguay as far as the high water of September and October would allow, which wa all that remained to he accomplished by the expedition. Commander John Rogers, in his report of the progress andcondition of the work under his charge, on the results of the North Pacific and Behring's Straits Kvpedition, has given a list of the chnrioin the engraver's hands; of those # en * ra J fin T> those in progress of reduction; those ready for reduction; those to be prepared for the ® n grayer, and of those already engraved and published' Captain Ladwalader Ringgold commanded this expedi Hon from the time of its departure from Norfolk, in June. 1803, to August, 18a6, wiien bo was succeeded by Com mender Rogers. In April, 1859, I ordered Capt. Ringgold to the duty of preparing his report.

A revision has been made or al! the observations to determine the lonffitujp of the observatory at Santiago, and the results have been tabulated, and are ready for the printer. This revision conclusively establishes the fact that Valparaiso, and probably the whole coast of Chili, as laid down on the best charts those of the British Admiralty.) are four and four-fifths miles too far to the west, an error of much importance to navigators. 

SURVEY OF THE ROUTE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND CHINA. l.icHtonant John SI. Brooke having arrived on the 13th iJd.r'r ' at kanagawa Buy, off Yokaliama, in the Hon of n a,,an ' J nterru P'e<l in the further prosecu • China On S the V Sa i° t f l,e ,. rote '"'tween San Francisco and China, i n the-3d of that montti occurred a severe cv clone, which caused the Fennimore Cooper to drag her anchors and strike repeatedly, so that to avoid the loss and save the lives of her crew, Lieutenant Brooke was obliged to run ashore Every assistance was afforded bv Commodore Pop off, of the Russian squadron, to repairand refit her. But in removing the ballast, her timbers were found so decayed that all hopes of repairing her. were abandoned. lier stores, with the instruments, maps and surveys, were most of them saved, and Lieutenant Brooke, with part of the crew, at the requestor the Japan ese government, returned to San Francisco in the Japanese war-steamer Kandinmarrah, to aid the captain of that vessel in navigating her across the Pacific. Lieutenant Brooke began in July last to prepare his re port. The meridian differences between San Francisco, Honolulu, Guam, Hongkong, Loo clioo and Kanagawa, primary stations in the survey, have been determined with excellent results. Observations determining inter mediate points, reefs, shoals and coast lines, are in process of rfciuction. The meteorological observations have been reduced. The deep sea soundings are under discussion.— The specimens obtained from depths of 12,000 to 19,800 feet are under examination by eminent microscopists, with results ofgreat interest. The plottingof the work and the report upon the results, embracing determina tions.of final positions of reefs, shoals and islands, survevs of portions of the coast of Japan, courses of storms, and routes to he preferred, remain to he completed.
