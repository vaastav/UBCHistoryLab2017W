which I expn-ssed in my special message to Congress in March last, in relation to this project, I deem it my duty again to press up on your attention. Subsequent consideration has but con finned my opinion, "That it is the right and duty of the United States to assist and maintain such supervision and au thority over any Inter-oceanic canal across the Isthmus that connects North and »South America ns will protect our National in terests." Mediation. The war lietween the Republic of Chili on the one hand and the allied Republics of l Yru and Bolivia on the other still continues. Th is government has not felt called upon to interfere in the contest that is within the belligerent rights of the parties as indepen dent States. We have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommo dating their differences, and have at differ ent times communicated to both belligerents our willingness to render such service. Our good odices in this direction were recently accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped that they w ould prove efficacious, but I regret lo announce that the measures which the members of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take with a mow to bringing about peace were unsucces !ul. In the couse of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all tin* Ministers of the United States have under their instructions acted with prompt ness and energy in protecting American in terests in other South American Republics. The relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue to he cordial, and our commercial intercourse steadily in creases to our mutual advantage. The*inter nal disorders with which the Argentine Re public has for some time past been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its external trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce ofthat Republic as well as to the development of its vast interior resources. Samoan Islands. In the Samoa government King Matistoa, under the support and recognition of the consular representatives of the United States, Breut Britain and Germany, seems to have given pace and tranquility to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt ;1S « whole the scheme of the tripartite local government which has been proposed, the common interests of the three great treaty Ï lowers require harmony in their relations to the native form of government, and this may t*e best secured by a simple diplomatic agree ment between them. It would lx* well if our consular jurisdiction and representation at Apia were increased in extent and import ance so its to guard American interests in the surrounding and outlying Islands of Océanien. Our Monolith-»-Egypt. The t)l>elLsk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of New York has safely arrived in this country, and will lie erected in that metropolis. The commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this government, at the earnest solicita tion of the Khedive, has acceded to the pro visions adopted by it, which will be laid be fore' Congress for its information. The com mission for the revision of the judic ial code <>f the reform tribunal of Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Forman, Consul Gen eral. and .1. M. Baehelder, Esq., have been appointed as commissioners to participate in this work. The organization of the reform tribunals will probably he continued for an period years. Sanitary Congress. . In pursuance of an act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime States to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, be ginning on January 1st. The acceptance of this invitation by the prominent powers gives promise of success in this important measure, designed to establish a system of internal modification by which the spread of infec tions or epidemic diseases may be moreeffee tively cheeked or prevented, and the alten t ion of Congress is invited to the necessary appropriations for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act referred to. Trade and Commerce. The efforts of the Department of »State to • nlarge the trade and commerce of the United States through the active agency of the Consular officers, and through the dissem ination of information obtained from them has m*«'n unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as develop'd in our commercial com munications and the value of the information secured by this means to the trade «and man «factures of the country, w ere recognized by Congress at its host session, and provision was made lor more frequent publication of Consu lar and other reports by the Department of State. The first issue of these publications is now being prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expeted. The importance and interest attached to the reports of the Consular officials are wit nessed by the general demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that the system of such publications is de serving of the approval of Congress, and the necessary appropriation for its continuance and enlargement w ill commend itself to yonr consideration. The prospective energies of our domestic industries and their immense production of subjects of foreign commerce, invite and even require active development ; the w ishes and interests of our people are in that direction. Especially important is it that our commercial relations with the At lantic and Pacific coasts of Bouth America, and with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, should be direct and not through the circuit of à Europan system, and should be carried on in our bottoms. The opprtunties 'which our front on the Pacific Ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and East IndieH, and with Australia and the Island groups which lie along these routes of navi gation should inspire equal efforts to appro priate to our own shipping and to adminia ter by our own capital due proportion to this trade. Whatever modifications of our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or ful to meet and direct this impulse to the enlargement of our exchanges and of our • arrying trade, 1 am sure the wisdom of Con gress will be ready to supply one. The ini tial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficacious, that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. *t seems to be very evident that the provision for regular steam }> 08 tal corn communication by aid from the government, been the forerunner of the commercial predoininence of Great Britain on all these ' °asts and seas, the greater share in whose a a to this up is to au in on of to the a trade is now' the desire and intent of our peo ple. It is also manifest that the efforts of other Europan nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their adoption of a regular steam postal communi cation with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the »States of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country', and to aid in their development. .Similar co-operation may be looked for in due time from East ern nations and from Australia. It is diffi cult to see how' the lead in this movement can be expeted from private interests. In respect to foreign commerce, quite as much as in international trade, postal communica tion seems necessary. Another matter commands public admin istration, aud thus prtains to government. I respectfully' recommend to your prompt at tention such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our For eign commercial exchanges, and the build ing up of our carrying trade. In this con nection I desire «also to suggest the very great service which might )>e expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific ocean, were a trans-marine cable laid from San Francisco to the »Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great influ ence of such means of communication in these routes of navigation, in developing and securing a duo share for our Pacific coast in the commerce of the world, needs no illus tration or enforcement. It may be such «an enterprise, useful and, in the end, profitable as it would prove to private investment, mav needs be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid, and I submit the mat ter for your careful consideration. Increase of the Navy. An additional and not unimport.ant, al though secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging our navy, may be found in the un questionable service to the expansion of our commerce which would lx* rendered by the frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and prts of all quarters of the globe. Ships of proper construction and equipment to be of the greatest efficiency in ease of a maritime war might be made con stant .and active agents in time of pace in the advancement and protection of our for eign trade and in the maritime discipline of young seamen, who would naturally in some numbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recognize the value of foreign commerce of an active government. Our naval vessels and the intelligence and patri otic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen, is a just subject for national pride. Financial Affairs. The condition of the financial «affairs of the government, as shown by' the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, Ls very satisfac tory. It is believed that the present finan cial situation of the United »States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency credit, growing w ealth, or extent and variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of «any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any country at any priod of history. All our industries are thriving, the rate of interest is low, and new railroads are being constructed. Vast immigration is increasing our population, capital, and labor ; new enterprises in great numbers are in progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are improving. The receipts thus far of the current y r ear. to gether with the estimated receipts for the re mainder of the year, amount to $315,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the esti mated expenditures of the year and leave a surplus of $90,000,000. It is fortunate that is of surplus of $90,000,000. It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue occurs at a period when it may he directly applied to the pay ment of the public debt. No public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the national debt as rapidly as pssible. The debt of the United States, less cash in the Tre.oa urv and exclusive of accruing interest, attain ed its maximum of $2,756,441,571, in August, 1865, and has since that ime been reduced to $1,886,019,504. Of the principal $108,758, 100 have been paid since March 1st, 1877, ef fecting an annual saving of interest of $6,107, 593. The bnrden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest and the application o the proceeds to the redemption of bonds be.oring a high rate of interest. The annual saving thus secured since March 1st, 1877, is $15,290,453. Within «a short period over $600,000,000 of five «and six per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very lavorable opportunity not only to fur ther reduce the principal of the debt, hut also reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention of Congress to the views expressed on this sub ject by the Becretary of the Treasury in his annual report, and recommend prompt legislation to enable the Treasury Depart ment to complete refunding the debt w hich is about to mature. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has eonservated greatly to the revival of business, and to our remarkable prosperity. Fears that preceded and accompanied re sumption have proved groundless. No con considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domes tic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coins or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1st, 1879, is estimated at $227,399, 428. 'Hiere arc still in existence uncancelled $346,681,016 United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war meas ure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the Nation's existence required, in the judgment of Con jijeas, the issue of legal tender paper money. That it served w ell the purpose for which it was created is not questioned ; but the em ployment of notes as paper money indefin itely after the accomplishment of the object for which they were provided was not con templated by the framers of tho law under which they were issued. These notes long since became like any other pecuniary obligation of Government— a debt to be paid, and w hen paid to be can celled, as mere evidence of indebtedness no longer existing said' in my year, that the retirement from circu lation of United States notes with a capacity of legal tender and private con tract is «a step to be taken in mir progress to wards a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of our government and to the interest and _______ __ _____________ I therefore repeat what was I annual message of last | of security of the people. At the time of the p.ossage of the act now in force retiring the coimage of the silver dollar, fixing their value and giving them a legal tender character, it w.as believed by many supporters of the measure that the silver dollar which it au thorized, would speedily become under the operations of the law of the equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability of tills re sult, nevertheless were willing to give the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to stop coinage, and if the experiment should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued to be of leas commercial value than the standard gold dollar. The coin age of the silver dollar under the Act referred to, began in March, 1878,'and has been con tinued as required by the Act, the average rate per month to the present time being $2,276,492. The total amount coined prior to the 1st November last was $72,847,750, of this amount $47,084,450 remain in the Treasury, and only $23,763,291 are in the hands of the people. Constant efforts have been made to keep this currency in circula tion, and considerable expense has been ne eessarily incurred for this purpose, but its return to the Treasury is prompt and sure, contrary to the confident anticipation of the friends of the meagre at the time of its adoption. The value of the silver dollar containing 4121 grains of silver has not in creased during the year, Prior to the pass age of the bill authorizing its coin,age the market value of the silver which it contain ed w as from 90 to 92 cents. As compared to the standard gold dollar during the past year the average market value'of the silver dollar has been 881 cents. It is obvious that the j legislation of the last Congress in regard to silver, so lar as it Avns based on «an antici pated rise in the value of silver as a rule has failed to produce the effect then pre dicted. The longer the law remains iu force, requiring, as it does, the coinage of a nomi nal dollar which in reality is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will lx* forced 'to .accept the single metal as the sole legal standard value in cir culation, and this a standard of less value in in for of of a a less value than it purports to be worth in the recogniz ed money standard of the world. The Con stitution of the United »States, sound finan cial principles, aad our best interests, all re quire that the country should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coin of intrinsic value as, bullion equivelant to that which upon its face it purports to pos sess. The Constitution in express terms re cognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency Is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of ex change, to the disparagement of important interests. The United States produces more silver than any other country, aud is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute to this result if Congress will repeal so lunch of existing legis lation as requires the coinage of a silver dol lar containing 412] grains of silver, .and in its stead w ill authorize the »Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value with jxild. This will defraud no man and will be in accordance with familiar pre cedents in which Congress on several occa sions lias altered the ratio of value betw een gold and silver, in onWto establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two monies. In financial legislation, every me.asure in the direction of greater facility in the discharge of pecuniary obligations have been found by experience to dimish the rates of interest w hich debtors are required to pay, and increase the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our ow n recent finan cial history show's how' surely money be comes abundant whenever eonlidence in ex act performance of moneyed obligations is established. to ef a is a of Department of M ar. The «Secretary of War reports that the ex penditure of the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1880, w as $39, 924,773. The appropriations for this depart ment for the current fiscal year amount to $41.993,630. With respect to the army, the »Secretary invites «attention to the fact th.at its strength Is limited by statute (section 1115 revised statutes) to not more than 30,000 en listed men, but that the provisos contained in the appropriation bills have limited the ex penditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. believed that the full legal strength is the least"possible force at w hich the present or ganization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While the enlistment of this force would add some what to the appropriation for the pay of the army, the saving m*ode in other respects would be more than «an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the railroad system west of the Mississippi river and the great tide of settlers which has flow'ed in upon the new territories impose on the military an entire change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along the wagon and stage roads of travel is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected of a more substantial character than those heretofore constructed will be re qu ired. Under existing laws permanent build ings cannot be erected without the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sites and buildings have been authorized, the moneys received have reverted to the Treas ury, and could only become available throngh new appropriations. It is recommended that provision be made by general statement for the sale of such abandoned military posts and buildings as are found unnecessary and for the application of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. Many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed con dition of the country, and their occupation Ls continued at great expense and great incon venience, because they afford the only avail able shelter for troops. The absence of a large number of officers of the line on active duty from their regi ments is a serious detriment to the mainten ance of the service There is great demand for small detachments, and each should be com manded by a commissioned officer, and the various details of officers for necessary ser vice away from their commands occasions I the scarcity in numbers required for corn | P an >' duties. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law* authorizing the detail of officers Irom the active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the the the value it the au the other they re the a con the the ne its of of in to j to National Militia. Attention is called to the necessity of pro viding legislation for the organizing, «arming and disciplining the active militia of the coun try. and liberal appropriations are recom mended in this behalf. The reports of the Adjutant General of the army .and Chief of Ordnance, touching this subject fully, set forth its importance. Army Schools. The report of the officer in charge of edu cation in the army shows that there are 78 schools now' in operation in the .army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The Secretary recom mends the enlistment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank and pay of commissary ser geants. Bureau of Military Justice. An appropriation is needed to supply the Judge Advocate of the Army with suitable libraries, and the Becretary recommends that the corps of Judge Advocates be placed upon the same footing, as to promotion, with the other staff corps of the army, under existing laws. The Bureau of Military Justice eon sists of one officer, .Judge Advocate General and a corps of Judge Advocates, of eight offi cers of equal rank (Majors), with a provision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four when reduced by casualty or resignation to the number. The institution of a Bureau of Military .Justice and corps of Judge Advo cates upon the same basis with other staff corps of the army would remove «an unjust discrimination against deserving officers «and subserve the best interests of the service. Capitaiu Grant Reeommended for General. 1 commend the attention of Congress to the great services of the commander-in-chief of the army during the w ar for the Union, whose Avise, linn, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for recognition of distinguished military merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services to the country. Congress, authorizing the appointment of a Captain General of the army, with suitable provis ions relating to compensation, retirement and other details, would in my judgment be altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by the country. Navy Department. The report of the Becretary of the navy exhibits successful and satisfactory manage ment of that department during the last fiscal year. Postal ex more aud it in if dol in the man pre een of of to are be ex is ex the to its of is at Department. The report of the Postmaster General ex hibits a continual growth and high state of efficiency of the po«stal service. The opera tions of no department of the government, perhaps, represents with greater exactness the increase in population and business of the country. In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,578,067. In 1880 the receipts were $33,315,479. All the inhabitants of the country are directly and personally in terested in having proper mail facilities, and naturally watch the postofiice very closely. This careful oversight on the part of the people has proved a constant stimulons to improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,134 post offices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, mak ing an additional annual transportât ion of 10,804,191 miles. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at $38,845,174, and expenditures at $42,475.932, leaving a deficiency to lie appropriated out of the Treasury of $3,630,757. Especial attention is called to the sugges tion of the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to encourage by appropriate legisla tion, the establishment of American lines of steamers by our own citizens to carry the mails between our own ports and those of Mexico, Central America. South America, and the Trans-Pacific countries, is commend ed to the serious consideration of Congress. Department ol' .Justice. The Attorney General recommends the es tablishment of an intermediate court of er rors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of judge's of the circuit court in each circuit, with the exception of the 2d circuit, should be increased by the addition of another Judge; that in the 2d circuit two should be .added, and that an intermediate apellate court should be formed in each cir cuit, to consist of the circuit judges and cir cuit justice, and that in the event of the ab sence of either of these judges the place of the absent judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the cir cuit. * Interior Department. The report of the Becretary of the Interior presents an elaborate account of the opera tions of that department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. The Indians have mode gratifying progress in agriculture, herding and mechanical pur suits. Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the government, are quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their permanent homes, building houses and engaging in occupations of civilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them has been re markably fruitful of good results in giving many of them congenial and remunerative employment, and in stimulating their am bition to earn their own support Their hon esty, fidelity and efficiency as earners are highly praised. The organization of a police force of Indians has been equally successful in m ainta i nin g law and order upon the reser vations and in exercising a wholesome moral influence among the Indians themselves. I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in recommending that the pay of this force be increased, as an inducement to the best class of young men to enter it. The disturbances caused on our Northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge in the British dominions, are likely to cease.. A large majority of his followers have surrendered to our military forces, and the remainder are apparently m the process of disintegration. I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in expressing the earnest hope that Congress will at this session take favorable action on the bill providing for allotment of lands in the different reservations in severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring in fee simple title inalienable for a certain period and eventual disposition of the residue of the reserv ations for general settlement, with the consent and for the benefit of the Indians, placing the hitter under equal protection of of Public Land Matters. * A large increase Is reported in the dis posal of public lands for settlement during the p«ast year, which makes a prosperous growth in our agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement of population toward our unoccupied lands. As this movement pro ceeds, codification of our Land laws as well as proper legislation to regulate the deposition of public lands, become of a more pressing necesssty, and I therefore invoke the con sideration of Congress to the report and «ac companying draft of a bill made by the. Public Land Commissioner and which were communicated by me to Congress .at its last session. Early action upon this 1 important subject is highly desirable. Department of Agriculture. The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses his confident belief that his efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly rewatcled. The im portance of the results attained' have at tracted marked attention at home and have received special consideration from foreign powers. Education. The Commissioner of Education asks special attention to the depredations committed on hinds reserved for the future support of pub lic instruction and, will be in great need of help from the nation for schools in the Terri tories «and in the »Southern States. The rec ommendation heretofore made is repeated and urged, that an educational fund be..set apart from the net proceeds of sales of the public lands annually, the income; of which and the remainder of the net .annual pro ceeds to be distributed on some satisfactory plan to the States and Territories and the District of Columbia. The acts of Congress from time to time donating public* lands to the several States and Territories in aid of educational interests, have proved to lx* wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit. Concluding Words. In my annual messages heretofore, aiul in my special message of December 15th, 1879, I have urged upon the attention of Congress the necessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to the Capital, and 1 am constrained by its importance to advert «again to the subject. These flats embrace, an area of several hundred acres, and are an im pediment to the drainage of the city and seri ously impair its health. It Is believed with this substantial improvement of its river front, the Capital would be in all respects one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is necessarily the place of residence of persons liom every section of the country engaged in the public service, and many others reside here temporarily for the transaction of business with the govern ment. It should not be forgotten that the land acquired will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it and the navigation of the river be greatly improved. 1 therefore again invite the attention of Congress to the importance of prompt provision for this much needed and too loong delayed improvement. The water supply of the city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use throughout to the of the a the of the of es er in 2d cir ab of the in I in m to of the city, the consumption by the government Is necessarily very great in the navy yard, irscnal and the various departments, and a large quantity is required for the proper preservation of the numerous parks and the leansing of sewers. I recommend that this subject receive the early attention of Congress, and that in making pro vision for an increased supply such means be adopted as will have in view: the future growth of the city. ' Temporary ex pedients for such «a purpose cannot hut be wasteful of money, and therefore unwise, as a more ample reservoir, Avith corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should in my judgment be constructed.-' 1 commend again to the attention of Con gress the subject of removal from their pres ent location of the depots of several railroads entering the city ; and I rencAv the recom mendations of my former messages in behalf of the erection of a building for a Congres sional library ; the completion of the Wash ington Monument* aad of libérai «appropria tions in support of a benevolent reformatory and the pen.al institutions of the District.
