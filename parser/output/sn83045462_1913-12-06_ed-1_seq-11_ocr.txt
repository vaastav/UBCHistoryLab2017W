II IRREGULAR TODAY Prices at Standstill After Early Advance and Subse quent Reaction. SOME SPECIALTIES SHOW IMPROVEMENT Abrupt Fall in American Telephone and Renewed Selling1 of Ex press Stocks Feature. NEW YORK, December 6.?First prices of the leading stocks today showed a nar row and Irregular movement. The Ilarri man stocks were slightly higher, while Amalgamated and Steel eased off. Sec ondary transactions indicated an Improv ing tendency. Canadian Pacific and Vir ginia-Carolina Chemical gained a point. Union Bag and Paper preferred advanced making a gain of over nine points in the last few days. A run-in of the short interest carried up prices swiftly. Union Pacific rose a point, and other favorites half as much. Satisfaction of this demand rendered the market vulnerable to realizing sales which canceled gains. New Haven Reacts. New Haven became weak, reacting to a point under yesterday's final price. The market closed irregular. After an early advance and a subse quent reaction, prices stood almost still to the end of today's half session. The forward movement was utilized for dis tribution of,stock. Perceiving the source of this selling, traders helped along the reaction, but professional offerings moderated when prices returned to about a parity with yesterday's close. Basis for Bear Sealing. Bear selling was based in part on the assumption that today's bank state ment would be an unusually unfavorable one. A variety of inactive specialties showed marked improvement, which passed unnoticed to the weakest condi tion of the general market. Liquidation of express stocks con tinued, and there was also an abrupt fall in American Telephone. Bonds were steady. * Undercurrent of Firmness. Movements of stocks this week were unimportant except for one Interval of pronounced strength. There was ap parent an undercurrent of firmness, owing primarily to the sold-out condi tion of the market. The ready demand for stocks whenever attempts were made to depress them checked bearish ef forts. At the same time operations for the long account were limited by the business and political uncertainties of the present situation and the high money rates. In consequence, the market was in a condition of deadlock most of the week. Railroad reports of earnings were ex ceptionally unfavorable. The copper market was again depressed, and from tb? steel trade came reports of slack ening business, price reductions and curtailment of operations. President Wilson's message to Con gress had little effect on sentiment, al though the vigorous rise in stocks Wed nesday was attributed in some quarters to the manner in which the trust ques tion was treated. The bank statement of last week, showing a deficit, and further losses of cash to the interior this week were reflected in money market conditions. Call funds, instead of relaxing promptly after the first of the month, as had been expected, held at stiff quotations throughout the week. Washington Stock Exchange. Sales?

Cables were a little better than due on the New York close of yesterday, but the English spot sales were smaller and private advices reported increased hedge selling. The spot house buying lure was accompanied by reports that* the mills had shown more interest in spot cotton late yesterday and there were private reports of a rapid falling-off in ginning.
