SAYS MEDITERRANEAN SHOULD . BE IDE A CLOSED SEA Republican A. P. Leased Wire LOXDOX, Dec. !). The Morning Post today gives prominence to a suggestion by a correspondent that the Mediterranean be declared a closed sea and that no ship be al lowed to trade there without a li cense from the entente naval authori ties. The step should be taken, the cor respondent argues, in an effort to combat Teutonic submarines which he declares, are kept supplied with oil, provisions and torpedoed by neu tral steamers. He suggests that neu tral ships on nearing the straight of Gibraltar- should be given a course which they would lie required to fol low without deviation or delay and says that no neutral ships carrying oil fuel should be allowed in the Mediterranean. "Greek ships are probably- the worst offenders," says the correspond ent. "A short time ago one of our largest transports carrying 6uH0 troops ran close to a Greek ship which was in the act of supplying oil to an enemy sumarine off Tunis, while on an occasion a suspicious oil tanker was close by when fine of her transports was sunk and later was seen exchanging signals with the submarine." IHARTO'S WORK GETS PRAISE IN ECONOMIST Republican Advertisement for New York Store Described in Article in Recent Issue of Magazine In no uncertain terms, the Dry Goods Economist, a journal devoted to de partment store interests, praises the double-page advertisement recently prepared by. S. W. Marto of the Xew Yolk Store for The Republican. The following article appeared in the issue of December 4. regarding Manager Marto's "copy" and its results: Excellent Type Display Group of small ads devoted to gen era! merchandising, and a 14-column spread (reproduced on this page) ex ploiting the store's first anniversary. There are a good many things to be said in favor of the merchandising, the values and the policy back of this ad, but it is most interesting from the standpoint of layout, type display and arrangement. In the first place, every department is laid out in such a way that it is of some assistance to every other depart ment in the ad, especially if two ad joining sections are allied either in use or in kind. In the second place, the adman has taken particular pains to feature one section in a striking manner. The great advantage of this skillful method of display is that the featured depart ment, while drawing attention to itsilf. undeniably does not detract in the least bit from smaller departments in the ad. The scheme of type display is es pecially attractive. Practically all the section captions of the r,d are set in italics. Frequently the subcaptions also are italicised. Then the body of the item is set in a clear, easy-to-read font that approximates italic in effect, hut is really simply light-face, thin type. Taken in a big expanse, as they are in the ad, these items present a gsay space which is very attractire. Prob ably the only faults in type display are the dense black used in the main cap tion of the ad and the stiff. wooden looking reproduction of the store. Bet ter have left out the picture of the stole if a better cut was not obtainable. However, the ad is so good generally that this little fault does not seriously detraet from it. Adrnen who are looking for a good method for pig layouts, will do well to study this double-truck e.nniversarv ad. to a any ufter and 

FEDERATION OF RURAL CHURCHES NO COMMENT ON MESSAGE Republican A. P. Leased Wire THE HAGUE. Dec. 8 (Via London, Dec. 9.) The Dutch newspapers al most unanimously refraoin from com menting on the president's message, preferring to await the arrival of its full text. The Nieuke C'ourant, how ever, says:.

COLUMBUS, O., Dec. 8. A nation wide movement to make the country church the religious social and agri cultural center for the farmer through a federation of church in rural com munities, was launched here today at the opening session of the conference of the commission on church and country life which is being held under the auspices of the federal .council of the Churches of Christ in America. Speakers advocated the laying aside of sectarian differences in the forma tion of such a federation and agreed that rural churches are too numerous, country preachers are underpaid and that their enegrics are divided among too many charges. Governor Frank B. Willis of Ohio, and Gifford Pinchot, chairman of -the commission, and Dr. Washington Gladden of Columbus, reearded by ! many as the father of the movement to bring about interdenominational co-operation, were among the speakers.

P. Leased Wire SAX FRANCISCO, Dec. 8. In re storing the cities of Sacramento, Stockton, San Jose and Santa . Clara to the tatus of terminal points the United States circuit court of appeals opened the way today, according to legal authorities here, for similar re lief for 1S2. other inland cities which enjoyed terminal rates prior to April 30. The circuit court issued an injunc tion restraining the interstate com merce commission from enforcing its order of April 30, on B. and C. com modity rates on westbound transcon tinental freight to the four cities above named While the decision ap plied to these four cities, the opinion was expressed by lawyers that the other cities may now apply to the court and receive the same relief. Max Thelen, president of the state railroad commission, said tonight, that he had not seen a copy of the courts order; that the fact that Judge Bled soe dissented on the ground that the commission's order should have been annulled "in toto" and not in certain of its applications, would indicate that the order was limited in its ef fect to the four cities named, but that he believed that the order would mean the eventual restoration to ter minal status of the 182 other inland cities. received, it was probable that no communication would be sent to Vienna. Tonight it was suggested in some quarters that information of a most conclusive nature had come to Secre tary Lansing probably late .Monday night, and that it had been decided then that the protest should go for ward immediately. Whether Am bassador Penfield had transmitted the rep'y of the Vienna foreign office to the list of queries submitted by the United States could not be ascer tained. The belief prevails, however, that the state department had received answers of some son to the queries. In the inquiry Austria-Hungary was asked among other things whether a warning shot had been fired before the slip was shelled, whether time was given the passengers to get place of safety and whether shots Wf-r fired at the ship -she had come to a standstill before the torpedo that sank her was launched. The Austro-1 lungarian embassy here had not been advised tonight thit 'he inquiry had been answered and it was said that the Italian ambassador, who has trans mitted much information upon the smiting of the Ancona, had not fur nished the United States with any thing additional. The Anccna was sunk in the itcranean on November 9, bound from Naples for New The only testimony of a American survivor of the liner the department i; in Dr. Cecile Greil of her deposition Dr. specifically that .the pec'oed while the men, women and children in the cabin and steerage were scrambling to get into the smail boats. The department has been inclined not to accept, this single statement as positive proof unless corroboration was received from some source. Much weight was given, however, to what Dr. Greil had to say. Her testimony was considered of so much importance that she was taken to Rome, whoie she told her story to Ambassador Page. A report of this conversation reached the state de partment reeefftly. After the inquiry of the United States had been before the Vienna forcien office several days. Ambassa dor Penfield reported that more time was desired in which lo frame a re ply. Late last week. Secretary Ran sing instructed the ambassador to urge -i prompt reply. The American note, it is under stood, sets forth that the United States cannot believe that the com manders of the Austrian submarine have committed an alleged act of lawless ness except under a misappre hension of orders issued by the Aus trian naval authorities. It is de clared that under methods of war fare such as those employed in the sinking of the Ancona it practically is impossible, under such circum stances, to remain within the rules of fairness, justice and humanity. The principles of humanity and justice which were championed in notes to Germany, are understood to also be called strongly- to the atten tion of the Austro-Hungarian govern ment in this communication. Warn ing before submarine attacks is in sisted upon. While every opportunity is said to be left for an amicable reply, the belief prevails in usually well informed official circles th it the communication is more vigorous than anything dispatched to Germany while the controversy with that coun try over the conduct of submarines in warfare was in progress. No information could be obtained tonight as to whether the United States had determined whether any "misinformation" appeared in the statements of the occurrence which have ben issued by the Austrian admiralty. The Austrian contention was that a warning shot was fired, that the ship tried to escape, and that when she finally came to a stop after being hit several times, fifty minutes was given in which the passengers might have taken to the boats. At the end of that period it was claimed another vessel approached and the submarine submerged and torpedoed the Ancona which sank at the end of another period of 4 5 min utes. It was 'deniod that any life boats were fired at. but it was said that some loss of life was caused by the failure of the commander of the Ancona to act promptly. The Italian statement on the sub ject alleged that no warning was given before the submarine started shellirg the ship, which immediately came.. to a stop, and that shells were exploded on the decks of the vessel and in the lifeboats, killing and wounding many passengers. Just how many American lives were lost on the Ancona never has been definitely established. It is known that, several naturalized citi zens were lost. Reports on this point however have been so conflicting- that the state 'department never has been able to compile an accurate list. The texl of the American note, it was said tonifrht, will be given out for publication in morning- papers of Friday.

LONDON. Deo. 9. In an editorial this morning oeanrg with President's Wilson's message to congress, the Morning Post, referring to that pas sage in which the president speaks of the necessity of the United States holding aloof from the conflict tso "that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of pence alive," observes that if Mr. Wilson regards the nation as making one family and in thin domestic circle the United States is included, it is at least extraordinary that the l'nited States should be so manifestly inde pendent of the di sires and f( clings of ' her relatives. j The editoii.il proceeds to argue I that President Wilson strangely mis ! understands the nature of the conflict j which it says is a struggle for the j preservation of ehilization and not a mere clash of contending ambitious. Then, quoting passages from the president's deiieneiotion of ihe dis loyalty of naturalized citizens, the Utorial contends th;;t they are proof that the entente allies are fighting indirectly for the United States. "What," says the editorial, . "stands between America and 'creatures of passion, disloyalty anil anarchy' in their armed millions but the ence and of political liberty' she is the object of German ambition which goes unslaked as long as there re nk'iis one independent and free na tion." o I.
