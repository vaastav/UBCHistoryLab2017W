MESSAGE Recommends no Tariff Re vision for the Present THE NICARAGUAN TROUBLE Irresponsible Nations Not Protected by Monroe Doctrine A deficit of $73, 075,600 Legislation Against Injunctions. Washington, Dec. 7. In lilg annual message, read to congress, President Taft ealdt To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations of the Uutted States with all foreign governments have con tinued npon tho normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Europe. , The American, rights fin the fisheries on the north Atlantic coast under the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference be tween the United States and Great Britain for nearly seventy years. The interests involved are of groat Impor tance to the American Ashing Industry, and the final settlement of the contro versy (by the permanent court of ar bitration at The Hague will remove a source of constant irritation and com plaint This lit the first ease involving such great international questions which has been submitted to the per manent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser: ration and protection of the fur seals In the north Pacific are in progress with the governments of Great Britain, Japan and Russia. The attitude of the governments interested leads me to hope foe a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome of the negotiations. The Near East. The quick transition of the govern ment of the Ottoman empire from one f retrograde tendencies to a consti tutional government with a parlia ment and with progressive modern policies of reform and public Improve ment to one of the Important phenome na of our times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to tune made further advance in Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the near east. In that quarter the preatlge of the United states has spread widely through tho peaceful Influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There la every season why we should obtain a greater share of the commerce of the near east since the conditions are more favorable now than ever before. Latin America. , One of the happiest events In recent pan-American diplomacy was the pa cific, Independent settlement by tho governments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between thciu, which for some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain im bitterroents affoctlng other republics less directly concerned. Our Citiiens Abroad. This administration, through the de partment of stare and the foreign serv ice, Is lending all proper support to legitimate and beneficial American en terprises in foreign countries, the de cree of such support being 'measured by the national advantages to be ex pected. A cltluen himself cannot by contract or otherwise divest himself of the right, nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protec tion in bla personal ( and property lights when these are unjustly in fringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations it Is proper that in considering whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support ed in a particular country the govern ment should give full weight not only to the national as opposed to tho indi vidual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the govern ment of the country in question Is in Its administration and in Its diplomacy faithful to the principles of modera tion, equity and Justice upon which alone depends international credit in diplomacy as well as in finance. The Monroe Doctrine. The pan-American policy of this government lias long been fixed in its principles and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us, most of which have preat natural resources, stable govern- j ment and progressive ideals, the ap prehension which gave line to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the dot-trine as it exists nor any other doc trine of American policy Bhould b permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of . irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations or the insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions ou the part of the United States. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexican sciii served. I hope, to signalize the close and cordial rota tions which so well bind together this republic and the great republic Imme diately to the .south, brtweeu which there la so vast a network of materia! Interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have lepi) settled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened rfgltne now directing the govern , moot of Venezuela, provision has been i made fur arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July UO, VJlftJ, the government ot Panama agreed, after considerable ne gotiation, to Indemnify tho relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having, Indeed, been killed by the Panaman police tills year. This government was obliged to in tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or'settlement of tho claim of (lie Emery company against Nica ragua, which it had long beore been agreed should be arbitrated. A setfle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept. IK, 1009. Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the interests In the American claim of AJsop & Co. against the government of Chile. The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and had prom ised this government to settle it. There had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov ernments of the United Slates and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desiro to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII. Tho Nicarsguan Trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1007 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another aud in turn by all of the five Central Amer ican republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Near ly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,! which has kept Central America In constant tension or turmoil. The re-1 spooses made to the representations of ! Central American repuulies as due from the United States ou account of I its relation to the Washington eonven tlons have been at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far us possi ble, any semblance'of interference, al though It Is very apparent that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zoue and of the very sub stantial American interests in Central America give to the United States a special position In the zone of these republics and the Caribbean sea. I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this goverumept to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fuily appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true Interests. It would be uo less unnecessary to re hearse here tho sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alU-ged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were otli cers in the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks and was in control of about half of the republic, and as such, ac cording to tile modem enlightened practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to be dealt with us prisoners of war. At the date when this message is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with tb-j Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nicurnguan charge d'affaires and is intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with Its dignity, its duty to American in terests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may later be necessary for me to bring this subject to the attention of the congress in a special message. In the Far Esst. In the far east this government pre serves unchanged its policy Of support ing the principle of equality of oppor tunity aud scrupulous respect for the integrity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged the interest ed powers of both east and west. By the treaty of 1903 China has un dertaken the abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariif along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantage to foreign commerce as well as to the Interests of China, this government Is endeavoring to facili tate these measures and the needful ecquiescence of the treaty powers. When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project it was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have a certain direct Interest In the question of the carrying ont by China of the reforms In question. The administration deem ed American participation to be of great national Interest. Happily, when it was as a matter of broad policy ur gent that this opportunity should not be lost, the indispensable Instrumental ity presented itself when a group of American bankers of international reputation and great resources agreed at once to share In the loan upon pre cisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway ma terial should bo upon an exact equality with that of the other nationals join ing in the loan In the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there was a provision which caused consid erable public apprehension in that npon its face it was believed In some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along . the South Manohurian and Antung-MuU-den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise, to take part In which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough examination of the conven tions and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that uo such monop oly was intended or accomplished, j Tills government made Inquiry- of thej imperial Chinese and.

In common with the United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial, as usual. The arrangement of 100S for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The mutter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which Is terminable lu 1912 Is j already receiving tue stuny or iotn countries. Th Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress tbe esti mates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested in the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby It will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines in a manner to make It fl thoroughly ef ficient Instrument In the furtherance Of our foreign trade and of American Interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug. 5, 1909, I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government In collecting Information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug. 6, 1000. As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of tbe treasury department and as to matters of the needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with the department of commerce and labor In its relation to the domestic aspect f the subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of the tariff act of Aug. 5, 1009, it becomes tbe duty of the secretary of state to cou duct as diplomatic business oil the negotiations necessary to place him in a position to advise rae as to whether or not a particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. Government Expenditures and Rev enues. Perhaps the most Important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 80. j 1010, will exceed tbe estimated re-; celpts by $34,075,020. If to this deficit i ore added the Rum to be disbursed for the Panama cau.il, amounting to $38, 000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be in creased to a total deficit of $73,075,020. This deficit tbe secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this pro posal. . The Panama Canal. The policy of paying for the con struction of the Panama canal not out of current revenue, but by bond issue, was adopted in the Ppooner act of 1LK)2, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the princi ple by which a part at least of thp burden of the cost of tho canal shall fall upon our posterity, who are to enjoy it, and there is all the more rea son, for. this view because thje .actual 1 1 . mm ' 11 iff mws mm l m mm cost to date of tho canal, which is now half done aud which will be completed Jan. 1, 1015, shows that tho cost of engineering and construction will bo $207.70(5,000 Instead of $130,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to engineering and construction, tho oth er expenses, including sanitation and government and the u mount paid for the properties, the franchise and tho privilege of building the canal, in crease tho cost by $75,435,000 to a total of $375,201,000. The increase In tho cost of engineering nnd construc tion Is due to a substantial enlarge ment of the plnn of construction by widening the canal 100 feet In the Cu lebra cut and by Increasing the di mensions of the locks, to tho under estimate of the quantity of the work to be done under the original plan and to an underestimate of the cost of la bor and materials, both of which have greatly enhanced in price since tho original estimate was made. Government Eoonomy. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal , year I directed the heads of departments in the prepara tion of their estimates to make thero as low as possible consistent with Im perative governmental neee'sstty. , The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury, that the estimates of the expenses of the gov ernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911-that Is, for the next fiscal year nre less by $55,6(53,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year and less by $04,000,000 than the estimates for that year. Bo far as the secretary of tho treasury Is able to form a judgment as to future income, there will be no deficit in the year ending June SO, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs Of tho departments and of the gov ernment have been cut to tho quick. For the purpose of securing informa tion which may enable the executive and the legislative branches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction of the cost of governmental adminis tration tiie treasury department has Instituted an Investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants In the United States. . The object of the Investigation is to devise means to In crease the average efficiency of each employee. There Is great room for im provement toward this end, not only y the reorganization of bureaus and departments aud in the avoidance of duplication, but also In the treatment of the Individual employee. Under the present system It constant ly happens that tw-o employees receive the same salary when the work of one is far more dlfiicult and important and exacting than that of the other. Su perior ability is not rewarded or en couraged. Civil Pensions. As the degree of etliciency In all the departments is much lessened by the re tention of old employees who have out lived their energy and usefulness it Is Indispensable to atiy proper system of economy that provision be made so that their separation from the service! shall be easv and Inevitable. It Is lin-1 possible to make such pro v Mod nrilesa! naval appropriations so that they tire!,,f an enormous subsidy to tbe news there Is adopted a plan of civil pen- thirty-elgbt millions less than the cor-' papers, magazines and periodicals. A sions. We cannot, in view of the d- resnoudlnsr esM mates of last year, and! PreHt saving might be made, amount- vancing prices of living, hope to save I money by a reduction In the standard; of salaries paid. Indeed, If any change i Is made in that regard an Increase! rather than a decrease will be tieces- j sary, and the only means of economy will be in reducing the number of ! employees and in obtaining a greater average of etliciency from those re- tained In the service. Frauds In the Collection of Customs. I regret to refer lo the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds In the collection of the customs revenue at New York city, In which a number of the subordinate employees In tbe weighing and other departments were directly concerned and lu which the 'beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining company and others. The frauds consisted In the payment of du ty on underweights of sugar. The gov ernment has recovered from the Amer ican Sugar Refilling company all thst it is shown to have been defrauded of. Tbe sum was received Is full of the amount due which might have been recovered by civil action against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an excess reservation Id the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to be subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers. The treasury de partment and the department of jus-j tlce are exerting every effort to dis cover all the wrongdoers. Including the officers and employees of tbe compa-! nics who may have been privy to tbe fraud. It would seem to me that an Investigation of the frauds by con gress at present, pending the probing by the treasury department and the department of justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and other wise prove on embarrassment in se curing conviction of the guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Clause In Tariff Act. Two features of the new tariff act coll for special reference. Ia order that the maximum duty shall be charg ed against the imports from a country it Is necessary that the executive shall find on the part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the practice under them against tbe trade of the United States, but that the dis criminations found shall be undue that Is, without good and fair reason. No one is seeking a tariff war or a con dition In which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Tariff Readjustment. The new tariff law enables me to ap point a tariff board to assist nio in con neetion with the department of state In the administration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government in the administration of the entire law. I be lieve that the work of this board will be of prime utility and Importance' whenever congress shall deem it wise j asaia. lo readjust the customsdutie3. If the facts socured"by the tariff board are of such a character as to show gen erally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as described in the platform of the sue cessful party nt the late election I shall not hesitate to Invite the atten tlon of congress to this fact and to tb necessity for action predicated there on. Nothing, however, halts business aud Interferes with the course of pros perlty so much as the threatened revl Rlon of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliber ate investigation, upon which such re vision can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt It. War Department. In the Interest of Immediate econ omy I have required a reduction In the estimates of the war department for the coming fiscal year which brings the total estimates clown to an amount forty-five millions less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could be accomplished only by cutting off new projects and sus pending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. For the same reason I have directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than temporary, for I am sure that the in terests of the military establishment are seriously in need of careful con sideration by congress. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes In the army, In all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most em phasis Is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by w hich the merits of officers shall have some ef fect upon their advancement and by which the advancement of all may be accelerated by the effective elimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that, it would be unwise to make the large expendi tures which at one time were contem plated In the establishment of a naval base and station in the Philippine Is lands and have expressed their judg ment, lu which I fully concur, lu fa vor of making an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. The Navy. Tho return of the battleship fleet from its voyage around the world in more efficient condition than when It started was a noteworthy event of in terest a'iUe to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. The marked success of the ships In steam ing around the world In all weathers on schedule time has Increased respect for our navy aud has added to our na tional prestige. It Is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the respon sibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at Bag rank young enough to obtain adequate train ing lu their duties as ftag officers. Owing to the necessity for economy In expenditures, I have directed the curtailment of recommendations for the request for new naval construction is limited to two first class battleships and one repair vessel. The secretary of tbe navy has Inau gurated a tentative plan Involving cer tain changes In the organization of the navy department. Including the navy yards, all of which have been found ny tue attorney general to be in ac cordance with law, I have approved the execution of the plan proposed lie cause of the greater efficiency and economy It promises. Department of Justice Expedition In Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays in the admin istration of civil arid criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American Rar association and of many state bar. associations as well as the considered thought of Judges and jurists. In my Judgment, a change in public procedure, jyltb a view to re ducing its expense to private litigants hi civil cases and facilitating the dis patch of business and final decision In both civil and criminal eases, consti tutes the greatest need Id our Ameri can institutions. I do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited in lynch Ings are directly due to the uncertain ties and Injustice growing out of the delays in trials, judgments and the exe cutions thereof by our courts. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with author ity to examine the law and equity procedure tf the federal courts of first instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme court and the costs Imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury aud make recommendation with a view to simplifying and ex pediting the procedure as far as pos sible and making it as inexpensive as may be to tbe litigant of little means. The platform of the successful party In the last election contained the fol lowing: Injunctions Without Notice. "We believe that the rules of proce dure In tho federal court3 with respect to the Issuance of the writ of Injunc tion should be more accurately defined by statute aud that no Injunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice, except where irreparablo Injury would result from delay, In which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that in compliance with the promise thus made appropriate leg islation be adopted. Moreover, every such Injunction or restraining order Issued without previous notice and op portunity by the defendant to be beard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the Issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may fix unless within such seven days or such less period the In junction or order Is extended or re newed afjor previous notice and op portunity to be heard.

The jurisdiction of the poneral gov ernment over Interstate commerce ban led to the passage of the so called "Sherman anti-trust law" and tbe "in terstate commerce law" and Iti amendments. The developments In the operation of those laws call for a dis cussion and some suggestions 03 to amendments. These I prefer to em body in a special message.' Pottoffies Department Second Class Mail Matter. The deficit every year lq the Tpost office department Is largely caused by the low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second class mall matter, which includes not only news papers, but magazines and miscella neous periodicals. The actual loss grow ing out of the transmission of this second class mail mutter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $(13,000,000 a year. Tbe average cost of the trans portation of this matter is more than 0 cents a pound. Tbe statistics of 11)07 show that second class mall matter constituted (W.91 per cent of the weight of ll the mail and yielded only 5.19 per cent of the revenue. The figures given are startling and Ihow the payment by the government Ing to much more than half of the loss, by Imposing upon magazines aud peri odicals a higher rate of postage. Postal Savings Banks. I believe postal savings banks to be necessary In order to offer a proper Inducement to thrift and saving to a great many people of small means who do not now have banking facilities and to whom such a system would offer an opportunity for the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory substitute, bused on sound principle and actual successful trial In nearly all the countries of the world, for tbe systum of government guaranty of deposits now being adopted in several western states which, with deference to those who advocate it, seems to me to have In it the seeds of demoraliza tion to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. Ship Subsidy. Following the course of my distin guished predecessor, I earnestly rec ommend to congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bllU Interior Department New Mexico and Arizona. The successful party la the last elec tion lu its national platform declared in favor of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Ariioua, and I recommend that legislation ap propriate to this end be adopted. Alaska. With respect to tbe territory of Alas ka, I recommend legislation which shall provide for the appointment by the president of a governor 'and also of an executive council, tbe members of which shall during their term of office reside in tbe territory and which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable it to give to the territory lo cal laws adapted to Its present growth. I strongly deprecate legislation looking to the election of a territorial legisla ture in that vast district. Conservation of Natural Resources. in several departments there is pre sented Uie necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the sub ject Is one of such Importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be entered upon in this communication. For that rea son I shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to congress. The White Slave Trade. Thero Is urgent necessity for addi tional legislation and greater executive activity to suppress the recruitiug of tho ranks of prostitutes from the streams of immigration into this coun try an evil which, for want of a bet ter name, has been called "the white slavo trade." x Bureau of Health. There seems to be no reason why all ! the bureaus and offices in the general government which have to do with the public health or subjects akin tbJreto should not be united In a bu reau to be called tbe "bureau of pub lic health." 1 Political Contributions. I Urgently recommend to congress that a law be passed requ'ring that candidates in elections of ivembers of the house of representatives and com mittees In charge of belr candidacy and campaign file in a proper office of the United States government a t-tate-ment of the contributions received and of the expenditures incurred in tbe campaign for such elections and that similar legislation be enacted In re spect to all other elections which are constitutionally within the control of congress. Conclusion. Speaking generally, the country ia lu a high state of prosperity. There in every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business ex pansion, and we have just garnered a harvest nnexampled In the market val ue of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community; but, on the other band, they mean a very considerably Increas ed burden upon those classes in the community whose yearly compensation does not expand with the Improvement in business and tbe general prosperity. Various reasons are given for the high prices. Tbe proportionate increase in the output of gold, which today Is the chief medium of exchange and Is in some respects a measure of value, fur nishes a substantial explanation of at least part of the Increase iu prices. The increase In population and the more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been accom panied by a proportionate increase in , acreage production, may furnish a fur ther reason. It Is well to note tbat the Increase In the cost of living is not confined to this country, but prevails the world over, and that those who would charge increases in prices to tba existing protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost wholly In those products of the factory and farm In respect to which there has been either no increase in the tariff or in many, instances a Tery considerable reduc tion.
