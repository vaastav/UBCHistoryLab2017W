Dealers in Quality Footwear AVe say it again, and with empha sis, the doors of America are wide open to foreign commerce, and when the war is over and the wheels of in dustry in Europe are again turning to their full capacity of production, there will be nothing to prevent the United States from becoming the dumping ground for the goods of the great nations at war, unless the vic ious tariff system now in force is re pealed and protection restored, it all imports be put upon th- free list, is not necessary to an open door that all imports be put upon the free list. The present administration has gone far in that respect and doubtless would go farther were it not for the requirements of revenue, but there still remains a respectable number of products upon which duties are pay able. The moment, however, that tariff rates are lowered below the point of protection they cease to be a barrier or check to importations, and become, to the contrary, an in vitation to the outlander to come in and welcome. That is the effect and the purpose ot the Underwood tariff act, and the fact that we are not now reaping all the evil consequences of that measure is due to the temporary suppression of the manufacturing in dustries of Europe. When the war is over and the acci dental protection from foreign manu factures that the conflict has given us ceases to exist, the competition for American trade will be active and ruthless. The purchasing power of the markets of Europe will be great ly decreased. America, bulging with gold, will be the world's oyster, not to be opened with a Pistolian sword, for it is already open. The salesmen of Germany and France, and ol every other one of the countries that have goods to sell will cross the seas in numbers, and the present tariff will not keep them from making prices that American producers cannot meet without loss. This will not come im mediately after the war ends, for it will take some time to restore Indus will take some time to restore indus rial activities in Europe, but it will come, unless the people of America take steps to prevent the attack upon our trade and our riches.

HUMPHREYS DRUG COMPANY In a speech before the St. Louis Club recently, Gifford Pincliot, of Philadelphia, former chief Uni ted States forester, favored prepar edness on the part of this country and said, "World peace will remain a dream if Germany wins. The Ger man people are governed by a mili tary caste whose God is power. The German ruling class hates us of the United tSates as bitterly as it hates the English. If Germany wins, a people who do not understand our thought will be dominant in the world and we shall have to meet their views or their arms." Pinchot then pictured the attitude of the allies in the event of their vic tory. We need fear nothing, he said, as the power of the world would be distributed as before. The speaker counseled against al lowing the United States to sink to the level of China, the prey of any in ternational buccaneer. He recom mended the system of military train ing practiced by the Swiss. The present system in the United States he styled as too expensive per man. Pinchot closed his speech with a tribute to the allies, saying: "The allies are fighting the fight of civilization and democracy; fighting Speech by T. J. Mahoney before Annual Convention of Oregon Wool growers Association at Pendleton. In seeking a topic on which to ad dress you today, I was impressed with a question that is attracting the attention nd occupying the minds of the thinking people of the world to day. That it is one that may be ap plied intelligently to the business in which you are engaged is my firm be lief. In this period of World War, we stand aghast, as the greaest of the neutral nations, shocked beyond words of expression at the wanton waste of human lives, and man's ma terial achievements and next we marvel at the wonderful efficiency of one of the warring nations. So much has been said and written of the efficiency of everything that is German, that it has placed a new value on the word and brought home to us the noticeable shortcomings of Americans in efficiency, and what naturally follows economy. It is claimed that the expert appli cation of the principles of efficiency would increase our national wealth twenty-fold. An analysis of waste in all lines of human endeavor, com pared with the economics in nature, makes the thinking man believe this statement. Efficiency is not a new thought, but it is the all-absorbing thought of to day because it has come to be a neces sity. It has been demonstrated by the stockmen of our country, who by in-1 telligent breeding have brought the sandard of flocks and herds to a point that is not excelled by the breeders of the older nations of the world. I have not chosen this as my subject today because you as wool-growers are wholly lacking in the application of efficiency, but rather that you, who have tried and proved its worth in a few tilings, may use it to the advan tage of yourselves and your com munities in many things; thus spreading this doctrine among our people. What is efficiency? It is to put to use those methods that enable us to do the things that we are doing, bet ter witli less waste of time, energy and materials. It means economy in time, in energy and in money. Its intelligent application to the business of the day means a degree of success, the degree depending on how well it has been applied. Take the life history of 1,000 suc cessful men; they are nearly the same. Each has to a degree above the average man saved his time, his energy and has worked for a definite result. On the other hand, the life history of 1,000 paupers in the State of New York is a history of a man without methods, without a definite object in life, and with no appreciation of the value of time and energy. We find in our national affairs that efficiency is lacking. It Is said that any firm, corporation or individual can build and construct cheaper than the national government or the state or municipality. I am afraid that is too true. But why? Lack of efficiency, but we do not need to go to the gov ernment to find our examples. In passing it might be well to remark that when the car in Europe is over the competition among the foremost nations for the trade and commerce of the world will be such that only those who have efficiency, practice economy and thrift will be able to stand in the front ranks in the com mercial war that will follow. Coming to our own vocation, the methods that improve conditions in the nation and state are equally val uable in our own affairs in fact the state and nation copies after the peo pie and not the people after the state and nation. As sheepmen we believe that the efficient way to revise the tariff is by a Non-Partisan Tariff Commission. We believe that the time is not distant when this will be accomplish distant when this will be an accom plished fact; that we are about to be rewarded for the efforts of our em cient labors. That the sheep business as a profitable and permanent bust ness will then be established. This being so it calls for us to put our business on a permanent basts to lay out our plans and to build for the future. It has been said that the sheepman has always been crowded to the out-posts. This is true, as grazing lands have advanced in value the sheepman has met these condb tions by seeking cheaper lands. Now few G Mill ! $ 5 "2 t IF YOU ARE

I have heard men boast that their banker knew better how they stood than they did. Its alright fur your banker to know all about our standing; If he don't he won't stay in the banking business very long, but it is also a good thing to know from year to year how you tand yourself. Take a balance sheet of your condition at least once a year, and compare from year to year how your business is going. It will show you a wonderfully clear Insight to your business. Somehmg that you are doing at a loss will show up to astonish you, and some of the small things you have thought hardly worth while will show you a hand some profit. I believe that it will be demon strated that sheep can be raised prof itably as heretofore, and while I be lieve that the time is coming if It is not already here, when the sheepman will have to own his own ranch; I firmly believe that with more efficient management, truer economy, and closer attention to the business from all angles, that the honorable busi ness of raising mutton to feed, and wool to clothe the people, has a brighter future ahead than ever be fore, and it means success to you in dividually, and prosperity for the sheep country, Internal taxation was proposed ns the means of providing the money necessary for the national defense program. Sources of taxation sug gested are Incomes, gasoline, naph tha, automobiles and internal explo sion engines, l'abreated iron and steel, and a stamp tax on bank chocks. Ex tension of the war revenue bill and continuance of the present tarilT on sugar are recommended. The sale of bonds is oposed. The United States has remained neutral in the world-war because it had no interest in the causes and be cause it was the duty of the nations of the western hemisphere to prevent collective economic ruin.

ESSENTIA l POINTS IX PKKSI DENT'S MESSAGE. The theme of President Wilson's message, is national preparedness- preparedness by the United States to defend not only its own independence but the rights of those with whom it has made common cause. Every recommendation embodied in the document has tp do with the comprehensive plan for straighten ing the national defenses. The pro gram includes army and navy plans already made public; legislation for government-owned merchant ships; a rural credit law; the Phillipine and Porto Rico bills which failed of final passage at the last session; conser vation legislation; federal aid for in dustrial and vocational education, and the creation of a commission to inquire into the transportation prob lem. A docrlne of Pan-Americanism of full partnership of the nations of the western hemisphere in world affairs is proclaimed. Naturalized and native-born Amer icans who, sympathizing with hellig erants abroad, have plotted to violate their country's neutrality, are scath ingly denounced as men who "have poured the poison of dsloyalty Into the very arteries of our national life." and congress is urged to provide ade quate federal laws to deal with such offenders. "Such creatures of pas sion and anarchy must be crushed out," says the president. Boys Play IJnsket Hall. The high school boys are busy every night getting in trim for the basket ball season which will apen soon. They have secured the rink for practice and local games will also be played there.

The town team will probably organize some time this week. R. F, Wlglesworth and wife and Mrs. Victor Wiglesworth were in the city today from their Dutter creek home.
