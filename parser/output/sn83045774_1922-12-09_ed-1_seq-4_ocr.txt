STATE NOW HELPLESS if Tells Whitehall Club Rail Presidents Have Blocked Port Authority. HAS ACCIDENT PROPOSAL Wants Five to Ten Million Bond Issue to Eliminate Dangerous Crossings. H' Gov.-elect Smith at the annual meeting of the'New York State Association at the Whitehall Cluh yesterday blamed the railroads for delaying the plans of the Port Authority for improving the port of New York. "The difficulty with the Port Authority is the absolute lack of cooperation on the part of the railroads,'' he said. "We might just as well call a spade a spade. There is nothing the Port Authority can do until the railroad presidents sit down at a table and play ball with the State and nation, and this they will not do. They were committed to the Port Authority plan before we went to Albany and had it passed. The only way in which the nro^iivniA tnnnol r>a? >... Kl t i 11 t hii Jamaica Bay improvement made and the other features carried out is to unify the whole system along the waterfront, and the railroad presidents won't do it. / "Washington is the place for the Port Authority to transfer its activities for the time being. The Interstate Commerce Commission has control in cases where the Port Authority has not. WnntM Big Club of Towns. "In any suggestion I make about the Port Authority I know whereof I speak because I am a member of it. There is a provision by which the property of any municipality in the district cannot be taken by the Port Authority without the consent of the municipality. This was done by the demand of all the municipalities in the district. Mount Vernon, New Kochelle, Rye and other towns. All will be benefited by improvement of the port, but the plan does not touch any part of the State except Greater New York. "Shall we continue the State authority by itself with the manifest opposition of the local authorities, or make tipm a part of it? The local authorities can hold a bigger club over the ra i I r/Mi rl u than t Vi a Pftrt A nthnrlt v f nr the latter has no docks to rent or other advantages which the railroads might heed. "You may rest assured that what I may do will be done because X believe It will get us to the point quicker than the route by which we are going." Mr. Smith said he favored the State issuing bonds for $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 to cover the initial cost of elimination of all dangerous railroad grade crosslogs. "It is too much to put on the taxpayers in any one year," he said. "The State should pay a part, the locality a part and the railroads a part." The Program for 1023. The association adopted a program for 1923 with recommendations for governmental reforms and public improvements.

' I never said otherwise. 1 never at any j time said that America did not deserve j all of the praises that have been given to her from the fullness cf our hearts. "That fact is written in history, but j it cannot be denied that she left us. i The reasons you may discuss among [ yourselves, and I have no right to inj terfere." To the listeners it seemed like a debate between President Harding at the Capitol and Clemenceau in Continental Hail. Another indication that Clemenceau had carefully considered the President's message wus an approving quotation from it. He said 'he had been greatly comforted when he read In the message these "very suggestive lines": "The four Power pact, which abolishes every probability of war in the Pacific has brought new confidence In a maintained peace. . . . We have had expressed the hostility of the American people to a supcrgovernment or to any commitment where either a council or an assembly of leagues may chart our course." That pleased Olemenceau. "So yoc see." he sakl, "that even those who are supposed to disagree really agree at the j v? ry bottom of their feeling and reason' Ing power. That is what I ask and J hope this is something like an overture that some light will be coming. And 1 will be very glad if it comes from America. and I hope that diplomacy will have something to say about it and may be engaged in which, I um sure con bring nothing but good for us all." Ills Message la Peace. He added, lifting the famous eyebrows. "so you see I am not suoh a ! wicked man as 1 am represented to be. My message is pcjice?peace by any means." It was one of the frankest and most entertaining of his American contributions. A sample of his frankness was a reference to former President Wilson. He was speaking of the failure of Germany to pay to France the money "promised to us under the signature of France, of Kngland and of the President of the United States, and so on." "A great many friends have told me," he went on, " 'you know very well that Congress did not agree with the views of President Wilson and you ought not : to have depended upon us.' "I did not depend on you. You are I perfectly free. 1 never said a word to any American that Congress should j vote one way orvthe other. That was no business of mine. But what would you have thought of us if we had said to the chief of the American Republic at a certain moment, 'but you do not represent American opinion?" "I ask what would you have thought of us? You had a legal representative j there, a man of high mental powers, a man of strong means. So, do not tell me that I should know American politics better. My American politics were to go with America to the front and ] fight the Germans. Thai is the only American politics I knew at the time." The crowd chuckled over this and then applauded. Hid Meeting: With Lodge. Clenjenceau came to America, as ha i says, to speak to the people, but when he met Senator Lodge ro-oay he had an opportunity to present the cause of France to the man whose influence has been second only to that of President Harding and Secretary Hughes in maintaining the foreign policy of the United States. Senator Lodge passed tip the President's message In order to have ! luncheon with Clemenceau at the home I of the latter's Washington host, Henry 1 White, Nothing of their conversation was reported, but It was surmised that the Senator was as frank as Clemeneeau himself and that Clemeneeau might have had Senator Lodge as well as Mr. Harding in mind when in his Continental Hall speech he undertook to answer criticism he had heard. The House Committee on Foreign Affairs, headed by Representative Porter of Pennsylvania, went into the hall in a body to hear Clemeneeau and sat on the stage. The only member ot

THE_NE> FINDS PLE MANY HEARTS the corresponding Senate committee noticed was James \V. Wadsworlh, Jr., of New York. Among the other Senators present were Spencer (Mo.) and Reed (Pa.). The House delegation included Speaker Qillett, sitting in a box with his wife and Frank W. Mondell. Ambassador Jusserand and his stafl were on the stage. The State Department was represented by Under Secretary William Phillips; the War Department by Assistant Secretary J. May hew Wainwright. The chairman of the meeting, which was a conference on public opinion and world peace of the International Lyceum and Chautauqua Association, was Lorado Taft. Chicago sculptor. If Senator Hitchcock or Borah, who have had occasion to differ with Clemenceau, was there they were not identifiable from the press seats. But It was, as Clemenceau said, "a select audience." Possibly Ills Final Act. Clemenceau was introduced by his old friend. Malor Gen Taskcr H. Bliss. who saw both "splendor and pathos" In the events of the French pilgrim':) I long life. Clemenceau Insisted that his only message was "peaje for all men." He talked spiritedly for one hour and was often applauded. He spoke f j his American trip as "very likely to ' be the last act of my public life." "Do you think I would undertake such a thing at my age Just for the sport?" he asked. "I ask for nothing but friendship and good heart and good will. These are more valuable to me than all vour gold, although I know you have a groat deal of It." As usual he mentioned the fourteen points and President Wilson In the same i breath, and there was the usual Instantaneous applause. He told againthe story of German reparations failure and France's plight, pictured the peace ; treaty as "nothing if it is not executed." , He said it was a treaty containing some articles that should not have been there and would not have been If America had not been in the council. "Shall I say the full truth?" he exclaimed ; "well, maybe we were a little overexcited about those new people." But America had moderated and reconciled opposing views In the finest way. Clemenceau repeated his argument that j France is not militaristic or Imperialistic ( and, although of good Intention, cannot pay money which Germany has not paid her. "If Germany is not allowed to pay us." he said, "what can we do? I have my watch and gold spectacles, and that 1 Is all I can offer. Why H ? Came Here. "I am asked for what precise object , I came to America," he went on. "I j came to ask you why you went to war. . Did you go to help France reject the , enemy? It Is not done. Did you go to ] make democracy safe? Look afar and . you see the barbarity of the Turks, the \ anarchy of Russia and the need of , revenge of Germany met together under the treaty of Pappallo. Krupp Is working In Russia. I do not say war is coming. I hope It Is not. I do say it looks as though It might be coming. That is enough to take precaution. 1 simply say that If the moral assurance Is given that America does not disinterest herself from the execution of the ( treaty that is enough. ( "Then the Germans will keep quiet and the Turks will keep quiet, and . Russia will understand that if she wants to come back to the civilized world she has only to perform civilized acts. Thai j is all I say." Of the League of Nations Clemenceau said it had the advantage of existing and "that you can go there, maybe with some reservations to keep yourself free of its dangers; I do not know, but I | suggest now that the League has done much for Austria and Silesia and has done tt in a rather good way . . . Will you go back to the League of Nations with such reservations as you think necessary? You may.'' After this, Albert, the valet, who had a seat on the stage, handed his master his coat and Fiat, and waving at the applauding crowd the old man said good-by to Washington. This evening he drove to the French Embassy for a farewell. He boarded his private car In the Union Station at 8 P. M., and will leave at 1:20 A. M. for Philadelphia, where he will speak to-morrow.

Ford11 of Dearboarn, arrested last night, on a 1 charge of conspiracy to kill her husband. 1 Ney J. Ford, second cousin to Henry For/i, pleaded not guilty to-day and was held In $25,000 ball. A detective charged he had been introduced to her as a "Kan- 1 sas City gunman" and that he visited her and received Instructions for the killing which he said was to have been , done at her direction on her husband's farm., When Lieut. E. W. Kunath. the detective, arrived to keep the appointment he was dressed In an old suit unci a blue flannel shirt and had a three days' growth of beard. In his belt was an old army pistol. "It wss the most cold blooded story I ever heard," Sergt. Straith. another detective, said, In commenting on the 1 conversation of Mrs. Ford he savs he overheard. "We had previously cut a hole in the wall and placed a newspaper over this with small slits in it so we could see plainly who was in the adjoining room as well as hear the converesatlon. "For an hour we listened to. Mrs. Ford review her whole life with her husband from the time she first met him and how she 'played' him to propose to her." Mrs. Ford, the police say, told Kunath the best way to get to the Ford farm and where he could park his automobile. Kunath. according to the details of the alleged plot, was to hide In a barn to which Ford always came early in the morning to work In ttla hay mow. I When Ford entered the hnrn Kunath was to strike him on the head nn^l then carry the body by automobile fo another hay barn on the farmA the charges say.

Proposals by him to throw the body Into the river dr bury It were vetoed by Mrs. Ford as dangerous, Kunnth says. Aa a further preparation, he saya, she gave him a pencil sketch of the farm. Police , have the alleged sketch In their possession. It was arranged, Kunath says, that he was to get ILD.OOO for the 'job." Mrs. Ford also gave him a picture of herself an.l Ford taken Just after they were married so that he could Identify hia "victim,'" Kunath says.

V YORK HERALD, SJ YOUTH IN HALL CASE GUILTY OF PERJURY Schneider, Who Accused Pal of Murder, Lies Even When Before Jury. THIRD DEGREE DEFENSE Feeble Minded, His Lawyer Contends?Will Go to Trial on Girl's Charge Also. Special Dispatch to Tub Nbw Yoik Hrsai.d. ' N?w Brunswick, N. J., Dec. 8.?Ray- | mond Schneider was found guilty to-day 1 of having committed perjury in charging j his friend, Clifford Hayes, with the : murder of the Rev. Edward W. Hall and Mrs. Eleanor Mills. Thus was ended [ what the attorney for Schneider termed j one of the "side shows" of the murder i tence later, and while lie could receive ' up to seven years in State prison, Judge j Peter F. Daley will more probably send him to the reformatory. Almost 600 persons were in the court j room during the day. Schneider was j virtually the only witness In his own j defense, for though Walter C. Steadman, i Schneider's counsel, called Hayes he was tjuestloned only briefly. On the stand Schneider made a lamentable showing, j contradicting himself, shifting about and . occasionally lying obviously. Schneider swore that he had made j the false statement because the detectives pestered him to tell the truth. He asserted they kept at him, but admitted they all told him to tell the truth. He said he had bee.n losing sleep for some nights and was in much pain because of an infected finger. Hla Defense Proves 'Weak. He tried to make It appear that he had not accused Hayes until Hayes had said he, Schneider, was on the Phillips farm on the night of the murder, but even on his own admission he made his accusation first after he had been in the prosecutor's office less than two hours and several hours before Hayes was brought In to confront him. Mumbling his words and shifting his eyes, Schneider, in answer to questions, admitted that he had lied when he accused Hayes and also In an earlier statement, when he said he had gone home before 11 o'clock on the night of the murder. With considerable ability Schneider's lawyer. In his summing up, took advantage of Schneider's behavior. Ho said flatly that his client was feeble minded and It was easy to see that detectives anxious to get a clew in the murder case might easily have led him to make false admissions and accusations. Schneider, said Steadman, was the only person brought to account in connection with the murder. "He Is the goat," said the lawyer. John E. Toolan, summing up for the State, said tl\a.t In effect ihe Prosecutor's office was on trial. "If Schneider Is uot guilty, the Prosecutor's office and the system is guilty," said Toolan ' with asperity. He declared that the I newspapers had put the Prosecutor's office on the defensive and that the men therein, with their lips sealed, had at one time wondered whether the state of public opinion due to the murder case would not result in a lynching. Judge Daly addressed the Jury brieflyv The Jury was out only twenty minutes. > When the verdict was announced Schneider .took it stolidly. His father broke down and (hen his mother Ravel way. Pearl Bahmer, who had been the ! younR man's sweetheart, after belnR In i the court all day, was taken back to jail 1 before the verdict was announced. Schneider will be tried on the carnal abuse charge next week. He will probably not be sentenced for perjury until afte?^the second trial. Mrs. Jane Gibson, star witness in the Hall-Mills case, asserted to-day that her story had not been discredited and that furthermore she had been instructed to hold herself In readiness to appear again as a witness. She asserts that what she had to say about the woman in gray present at the murder scene was accepted. but that her Inability positively to Identify the man who did the killing ii.tul was the companion of the woman led the Grand Jury of Somerset county to refrain from finding an Indictment. Her statement confirmed the belief that Wilbur A. Mott, Special Deputy Attorney-General, Intends to take the case to Ihe new Grand Jury when it convenes on December 19. The Freeholders of Somerset and Middlesex counties In Joint session have adopted resolutions pledging their undivided support to Joseph E. Strieker. Prosecutor of Middlesex, and Azarlah M. Beekman, Prosecutor of Somerset. They also pledged the financial resources if the counties In running down the murderer*.
