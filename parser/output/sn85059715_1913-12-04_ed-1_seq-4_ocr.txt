Annual' Inspection of the county jail has been made and report there on made to the criminal court as re quired by statute. The inspectors did their work well as shown by the re port 'and they found rather unsatis factory conditions, some of which of course are natural results, such as ?- wore bedding. The system of feed ing, the lack of health precautions and the want of proper ventilation are condemned by the inspectors. ? Various recommendations apparent ly sensible arid Wholesome are made by the Inspectors and they can be speedily put into execution without harm to anyone or Infliction of hard shin The subject is one that interests hoth the sheriff and the county court and It IB hoped-ttiitr no- time will be Jost In msMnir ?h??

For Bftter Road Laws, As a result of the co-operation be tween the American Bar Association and the American Highway Assocla tlon, a deiflnite effort Is to be made to .revise tho chaotic road laws or the various etaUa.with a vjew to codifying and sTmphfnrtg" them Hut1 making them more uniform. The plan which has been evolved is so comprehensive that it is believed it will eventually result In a more uni form system of all laws, not merely thope dealing with road'matters, but those dealing with divorce, marriage and all other subjects. A committee of the . American , Highway Association has been ap pointed to take charge oI the matter and this committee is to meet with C. T. Terry, of New York, who is chairmhn or the committee on uril lort^. legislation or the American ,Bar Association, at the Vanderbilt hotel on .December 12. The members ot the American .Highway Association'. ,-conantttea'. are FV'^E.. "Wadham.,, of AlbTrty, N'Wf A. B. Fletcher, atet? highway engineer of California ; A. N. Johnson, atateTUfihWy^ffglneer <>r Illinois; J>. T. Colgrove, president of the 'Michigan 3tato. Good IRoads Association; and J. I. Pennypacker, seoret^ry of the American Highway Association,: Mr. Wadhams is chair, man. ^ It Is recognized T>y the American Highway Association that most -of the road legislation In various states In antiquated and in many Instances obsolete. Many of the road laws are one hundred years old. They are based on Colonial legislation, which, in turn, had been Ibased on ancient English precedent. There is very little uniformity in the laws among the states and it is relt that this fact puts obstacles in the way of those who are seeking to give the entire nation a network of 'Improved highways. It is probable that as a result of the meeting to ibe held in New York, the committee of the American 'High way Association and the representa tives of the American Jlar Associa tion will ask the governors of tho various states to urge upon the leg islatures the appointment of com missioners would work In conjunc and simplify the laws. These com missioners would work in conjunc tion with each other so that uni formity of the various state laws Might be achieved. K Templemoor, -who lite inence in the literary Held and <jf whonr all 'Harrison coun ty people are justly proud: \MelvlIle Division Post, one 01 (West. Virginia's most talented au thors, whose Abort stories hare been produced in several of the leading magazines of the country, including the Saturday Evening Post, Pear son's, the Metropolitan, etc., in the Metropolitan for (December has a ftory entitled "An Act of God,"i which is one of the teat of the "Uncle Aimer" stories yet coming from the pen of this strong writer 01 Action. Mr. Post's stories are differ ent from the writings of most all other authors of the present day, in that there is either a strong moral or a peculiar demonstration of Jus tice that dictates amoral. A great many of his' storied are based on actual decisions of- courts of ?justice, and he endeavors to im press always the absolute Impossibil ity of commission of crime without evidences being left behind that will convict the crlmnal. His ' efforts, therefore, are to unmake criminals, rattier than to make them as appears to be the effort of so many present day writers of stories of crime. Stories of successful/criminal resign,' lfke so many now appearing in nc tlon publication, are inclined toward encouragement of crime and tiie pub lishers should cease purchasing nar ratives oj that kind But not so Mr. Post's productions. With but the' singular erceiptlon of hie latest con-w triluition to the Metropolitan, all the stories we have -ever read by this au thor have clpsed with. an unmis takable warning to Hhe criminally Inclined; and even in this last one containing as it may, a justification of-the "unfwritten 'lafw," there is something mighty healthy and ele vating about it. Mr., Post is ai native of .West Vir ginia, a lawyer toy profession. and was for a nllmber of years associated 31tit the Hon. John T. MoGraw, of rafton, during which time some of i his strong stories were written. He Is the author of ?ewerai successful I books of Action. At the present I time, because oT his health condi | tions, we believe, he Is residing in Pennsylvania. His writings are rec ognized throughout the county as containing considerable merit, are widely read and greatly enjoyed. Thr.ft Instruct.'on.
