'" l against the government of Chile _ "«ally disposed of by the decision of his Britannic majesty George V.. to whom. amiable compositeur, the matter had ^ en referred for determination. majesty made an award of nearly $1,000, to the claimants, which was promptly paid by Chile. The settlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations between the republic of Chile and the United 8tates the only question which for two decades had giv en the two foreign offices any serious concern and makes possible the unob structed development of the relations of friendship which It has been the aim of this government in every possible way to further and cultivate. The message Co. was H.m Arbitrations. In further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the princi ple of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation, I to advert to the part of the United States In faclliating amicgble settlement of dis putes which menaced the peace between Panama and Costa Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican republic. Since the date of their independence, Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek ing a solution of a boundary dispute, which came as a heritage from Colombia to the new republic of Panama, upon its beginning life as an independent na tion. In January. 1910, at the request of both governments the agents represent ing them met in conference at the depart ment of state and subsequently conclud ed a protocol submitting this long-pend ing controversy to the arbitral Judgment of the chief Justice of the United 8tates. who consented to act in this capacity. A boundary commission, according to the international agreement, has now been appointed, and It is expected that the ar guments will shortly proceed and that this long-standing dispute will be honor ably happy satisfactorily terminated. Again, a few months ago it appeared that the Dominican republic and Haiti were about to enter upon hostilities be cause of complications growing out of an acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had failed to solve. The government of the United States, by a friendly Interposition of good offices, succeeded In prevailing upon the parties to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Mexico. The recent political events in Mexico received attention from this government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation created along our south border and the necessity for taking measures properly to safeguard Ameri can interests. The government of the United States, in its desire to secure a observance and enforcement of proper the so-called neutrality statutes of the federal government. Issued directions to the appropriate officers to exercise a dili gent and vigilant regard for the require ments of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual armed conflict ex isted. there was no official recognition of twliigerency Involving the technical neu trality obligations of International law. On the 6th of March last, in the ab sence of the secretary of state. I had a personal interview with Mr. Wilson, the ambassador of the United States to Mex ico in which he reported to tne that the conditions In Mexico were much more critical than the press dispatches dis closed: that President Dlax was on a vol cano of popular uprising; that the small outbreaks which had occurred were only symptomatic of the whole condition: that a very large per cent, of the people were In svmpathy with the Insurrection; that a general explosion was probable at any time, in which case he feared that the 440 000 or more American residents in Mexico might be assailed, and that the very large American Investments might be injured or destroyed. After a conference with the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy. I thought It wise to assemble an army division of full strength at San Antonio. Tex. a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of infantry in the Los Angeles district of southern Cali fornia together with a squadron of bat tleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a small squadron of ships • t San Diego. At the same time, through our representative at the City of Mexico I expressed to President Dta* the hope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures as to these mlli tarv maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance which should cause concern to his government I am more than nappy to hero record , he fac , tha t all apprehensions as to the *fT#ct of ths presence of so large a mill tory 'force In Texas proved groundless; disturbances occurred.

The past year has been marked in our relations with China by the conclusion or two Important International loans, one ror the construction of the Hukuang rail ways, the other for the carrying out of the currency reform to which China was pledged by treaties with the United ^ jreat Britain and Japan, of wnicn mention was made in my last an nual message. Especially Important at the present, when the ancient Chinese empire Is shak en by civil war incidental to its awaken ing to the many influences and activity of moderiration. are the co-operative pol icy of good understanding which has been rostered by the International projects re ferred to above and the general sym pathy of view among all the powers in terested in the far east. New Japanese Treaty. The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan, signed in 1894, would by a strict inter pretation of its provisions have terminat ed on July 17, 1912. Japan's general treaties with the other ^powers, however, terminated in 1911, and tne Japanese gov ernment expressed an earnest desire to cenduct the negotiations for a new treaty with the United States simultaneously wifh its negotiations with the ether pow ers. There were a number of Important questions Involved in the treaty, includ ing the immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff and the right of Americans to hold real estate in Japan. The United States consented to waive all technicalities and to enter at negotiations for a new treat v derstanding that there should be a con tinuance throughout the life of the treaty of the same effective measures for the restriction of Immigration of laborers to American territory which had been In operation with entire satisfaction to both governments since 1908 government accepted this basis of nego tiation, and a new treaty was quickly concluded, resulting In a highly satisfac tory settlement of the other questions re ferred to. once upon : ha The Japanese Europe and the Near East. In Europe and the near east, during the past twelve-month, there has been at times considerable political unrest The Moroccan question, which for . some months was the cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached a stage at which It need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman empire was occupied for a period by strife in Al bania and is now at war with Italy. In Greece and the Balkan countries the disquieting potentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has been the scene of a long internal strug gle. These conditions have been the cause of uneasiness in European diplo macy. but thus far without direct politi cal concern to the United States. In the war which unhappily tween Italy and Turkey this i exists be government has no direct political interest, and I took occasion at the suitable time to !s a proclamation of neutrality In that conflict. At the same time ail necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal Interests of American citizens and organizations In so far as affected by the war In spit® of the attendant economic un certainties and detriments to commerce, the L*nlted States has gained markedly In its commercial standing with certain of the nations of the near east. Coronation of King George V. The 2d of June of the present year marked the coronation of his Britannic majesty. King George V. In honor of this auspicious occasion I sent a special embassy to London. The courteous and cordial welcome extended to this gov ernment's representatives by his majesty and the people of Great Britain has fur ther emphasised the strong friendship happily existing between the two nations. Settlement of Differences With Great Britain. bonds of As the result of a determined effort on the part of both Great Britain and the United States to settle all of their out standing differences a number of treat ies have been entered into between the two countries in recent years, by nearly all of the unsettled quest!« tween them of any importance have been adjusted by agrément or arrangements made for their settlement by arbitration. Recognition of Portuguese Republic. The National Constituent assembly, reg ularly elected by the vote of the Portu guese people, having on June 19 last unanimously proclaimed a republican gov ernment. the official recognition of the government of the United States was given to the new republic in the after noon of the same day. international Conventions and Confer ences.

I quoted from my annual mes aage of December 7. 1909. In which I an nounced that the results of the Intema tional Opium commission held at Shang ™ *£ »». the invitation of the Lnited States, had been laid before this government; that the report of that commission showed that China was raak 25 remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradication of the opium evil; that the interested govern ha<3 not Permitted their commer cial Interest R to prevent their co-opera *2? . . ,s reform; and. as a result of collateral Investigations of the opium question In this country, Ï recommended that the manufacture, sale and use of opium in the United States should be more rigorously controlled by legislation Prior to that time and in continuation or the policy of this government to se cure the co-operation of the interested nations, the United States proposed an International opium conference with full powers for the purpose of clothing with . f, forc ® °* International law the reso lutions adopted by the above-mentioned commission, together with their essen tial corollories. The other powers con cerned cordially responded to the pro P°*w government, and. I am glad # « w * to announce, representatives °I ÜÜ Powers assembled (n conference at The Hague on the first of this month Foreign Trade Relation* of the United States. In my last annual message I referred to the tariff negotiations of the depart ment of state with foreign countries In connection with the application, by a se He* of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the United States to importa tions from the several countries, and I stated that. In Its general operation, sec tion 5 of the new tariff law had proved a guaranty of continued commercial peac*. although there were, unfortunate ly. instances where foreign governments d*»alt arbitrarily with American interests within their jurisdiction In a manner In jurious and Inequitable. During the past year some Instances of discriminatory treatment have been removed, but I re gret to say that there remain a few cases of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the United 8tates. While non*» of these Instances now appears to amount to undue discrimination In the sens*» of section i of the tariff law of August 5 IMS. they are all exceptions to that complete degree of equalltv of tar iff treatment that state has consistently sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. While the double tariff feature of the tariff law of liK<0 has been aLmply Justi fied by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new. undue dis criminations against American commerce. It Is believed that the time has come for the amendment of this feature of the law In such way as to provide a graduated means of meeting varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of American commerce In foreign to protect the financial Interests abroad of American cltise and injurious treatment on the part ef foreign governments through either leg islative or administrative measures. It would seem desirable that the maxi mum tariff of the United States should embrace within Its purview the free list, which is not the case at the present time, in order that It might have reasonable significance to the governments of those countries from which the Importation* into the United States are confined vir tually to articles on the free list. The fiscal year ended June 10. ltll. shows great progress in the development of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the highest record of exports of American products to foreign coun tries, the valuation being In excess of tt.OOO.f-OO.OOO. Tbes" exports showed a gain than $300 nos.W> the department of cour.trl^s as well a« against arbitrary -*»r th* preceding year of more Crying Need for American Merchant Marine. I need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be built up an American merchant marine. This is nec essary to assure favorable transporta tion facilities to our RTeat ocean-born* coromero» as well as to supplement the navy with an adequate reserve of ships and men. Tt would have the economic ad vantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid foreign shipping for carrying American iroods. All the rr^at commercial nations pay heavy subsidies to their merchant marine, so that It 1* obvious that without some wise aid from the congress the United States behind In the matter of merchant marine In Its present anomalous position. Legislation to facilitate the extension of American banks to foreign countries Is another matter In which our foreign trade needs assistance. With these factors and the continuance of the foreign-service established fdepart mental. diplomatic and consular) upon the high plane wh*»re it has been placed by the recent rearoganlxation this gov ernment would be abreast of the times In fostering the Interests of Its foreign trade, and the rest must be left to the energy and enterprise of our business men. Improvement of the Foreign Service. ust lag The entire foreign-service organization is being improved and developed with especial regard to the requirements of the commercial interests of the country The rapid growth of our foreign trade makes It of the utmost Importance that governmental agencies through which that trade is to be aided and protected a high degree of effl should tho foreign rep resentatives be maintained upon a gen erous scale In so far as salaries and es tablishments are concerned, but the se lection and advancement of officers should be definitely and permanently reg ulated by law so that tho service shall not fall to attract men of high character and ability. The experience of the pas: few years with a partial application ol civil service rule* to the diplomatic and consular service leaves no doubt in my mind of the wisdom of a wider and mor permanent extension of those principles to both branches of the foreign service. I therefore again commend to the fa vorable action of the congress the enact ment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the principles em bodied in section 1751 of the Revised Stat utes of the United States, in the civil service act of January IS. 1M, and th* executive orders of June 27. 1906, and of November 26. 1909 In its consideration o' this important subject I desire to recall to the attention of the congress the ver> favorable report made on the Lowder bill for the Improvement of the foreign service by the foretgr affairs committee of the house of rep re sencatives. Available statistics show ths: the strictness with which the merit sys tem has ben applied to the foreign serv ice during recent years and the abeolutr non-partisan sélection of consuls and diplomat» service secretaries who Indeed far from being selected with any view to political consideration have actuall> been chosen to s disproportionate extern would have been un foreign service unde: should possess t ciency.

Sluggish bowels will be followed by loss of appe tite, restlessness during sleep, irrita bility and a dozen and one similar evi dences of physical disorder. At the first sign of such disorder give the child a teaspoonful of Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin at night on retiring and repeat the dose the following night If necessary—more than that will scarcely be needed. You will find that the child will recover its accustomed good spirits at once and wiil eat and sleep normally.
