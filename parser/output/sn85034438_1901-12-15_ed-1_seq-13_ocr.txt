"** ?';;.,?;", ll Modern Eloquence" How To Talk, When To Talk And Just What To Say. One of the Most Popular Lit? erary Productions of the Day. Almost every man and a great many women at soma time in fiis or her life, is called upon to say something before a popular assemblage. It is surprising how difficult it is to express one's thoughts at? tractively, not to say with force, before any miscellaneous audience. A man may be intelligent, he may write well, and yet when he is called on for a short speech on some commonplace topic at any gath? ering, he may entertain something strong-1 er than a longing to ba permitted' to sit : down gracefully before he is fairly on ' his feet. The art of public speaking is found | largely in the ability to speak well t-ith- I out making any apparent effort to be Im-: presslve. The interesting talker, either in j ordinary conversation or in public utVcr- j ance, is the man or woman who talks ! without making too great a display of i the emotion. If a man before any public : body will talk in the samo way that he ? converses with his friends his speech ? will always command popular recogni- i lion. Ihe hardest lesson for any man t? learn is tho one of simplicity in state- ] ment. To talk well is to talk simply and ] plainly, and, paradoxical as it may seem, ; the man of scholarly attainments who is effective ns ;: public speaker Is the man who has learned the lesson, and a hard? lesson it is, of talking- effectively, j without making any show of pedantry. One of thc greatest public speakers of j the century is the Hon. Thomas B. Reed. I As editor-in-chief of "Modern Eloquence," j now being distributed by The Times ? Club, Mr. Reed has devoted practically j his entire time since resigning the speak- ? ership to the work of supervision and editing this standard publication, with the view of presenting to the people a collection of all public orations of merit extant. "Modern Eloquence" tells people how to talk, when to talk, nnd what to say if called upon to make a public ad? dress on any occasion. As a literary pro? duction this publication has commanded the best recognition of educated people everywhere. While its Subject matter is "heady" in the sense that it satislies tbe demands of the scholar, yet the matter is written in a vein that appeals to pop? ularity in all cases where there is a demand for standard literature of the best merit. A great demand is being made by peo? ple in A'irginia and Xorth Carolina, for "Modern Eloquence" as a worthy Christ? mas presentation to friends. To meet this heavy demand The Times Club has laid in a large supply of these books, a sup? ply it is thought which will bo ample to meet every reasonable, call that may be made during the holiday season, l'u? til this supply is exhausted The Times Club will continue to offer "Modern Elo? quence" at a large special discount from publisher's price, and on easy terms of payment that place the entire set of 10 handsomely bound hooks within easy reach of every well-informed man or wo? man In The Times' wide field. During the past two months hundreds of sets of "Modern Eloquence" have Itch sold in A'irginia and Xorth Carolina.

' FIFTY THOUSAND ALREADY RAISED -Dr. Hatcher's Effort for the College in Next Fortnight, FRIENDS MUST RALLY NOW Every Doilar Now Counts One and a Third ?Memorial School to Professor Harris. Alumni Responding?All Must Act Quickly_A Plea. The supreme moment in Dr. Hatcner s effort tu raise "*7?,000 for Richmond Col lego is approaching. But ?ifteen mire days remain in this year. The end oi the year is the end of this particular effort. If that sum is not in hand by the 31st day of this month the $**5,U00 ottereci the college by Mr. Rockefeller Is lost. The timo has now come wne-i tne. friends of the college must show them? suives 'as such. The opportunity row presents itself as It has not in this gen? eration for aid .to the conege, Rich? mond, Virginia and the. cause of hlf education. A dollor now means a aullar and thirty-three cents. For every three dollars given ta the college by its friends in the State and its alumni scatter id ove the face of tne globe, Mr. RocKefetler will give one. Th? closest friends of the college, those who are officially connected with the in? stitution, are making the efforts of their lives to get this money when it counts fur so much, '-.he time of the home? stretch has arrived. Tne feeling is grow? ing that thc race will De run. There is much reason to he encouraged, say Dr. Hatcher and President Boatwrtgnt. 

WHAT HAS BEEX DONE. So far Dr. Hatcher has succeeded in raising Soti.OOO. This leaves $19.000 to be secured in fifteen, days. It would hardly seem possible to do this, yet so confident is Dr. Hatcher of the loyalty of the friends of the collego that he is hopeful of getting this large sum of money in the last days. Thc contributions to the college have come from every section of tho State and from tho alumni every? where. This is one of the conditions that the money shall be raised in Virginia, save that the alumni of Vne college, no matter where they may be, may help. The largest sum given so far has been $5,000. This came from a gentleman out? side of Richmond, but in the eastern part ?jf tho State. Quite a number of: contributions of $1,000 have been re? ceived. MEMORIAL TO PROF. HARRIS. The alumni have done their part well. They are to do more. They are asked to ' give. $25,000 to endow the chair of Greek, in memory of Prof. H. IT. Harris, who for so many years was the teacher of Greek in tho college. Hundreds of let? ters are now being sent out broadcast over the country giving alumni an op? portunity to pay this tribute to thc man they loved and honored. Every cent that is given in reply to this appeal before the 1st of January can be counted as a part of the $75,000. If it ciimes the first day of January, it cannot be used for this purpose, though, of course, it will be available for the memorial endowment. President Boat? wright said last night that every alum? nus was urged to send in his gift at i once, it Is an interesting fact that a. son of Prof. Harris. Dr. ?. XV. Harris, is now occupying the chair which his father filled with such distinction. It is not an idle dream, that of Dr. Hatcher, that $19,000 can be raised in fif? teen days, or at the rate of a little more than $1,200 ? day. The First Baptist Church has promised $10.000. The sum of $S,500 has already been given, and this alone has been counted in the ?ot?.OOO stated as secured. But the people of the First Baptist Church say they will givo much_ more thaj? ?io.oon. The $100,000, if secured, will he added to the permanent endowment of the col? lege. Of this amount $25,000 will endow the Greek School in the honor of Prof. Harris. So much of the remainder as may be needed will be used to establish a chair of history and a chair of biology in the college. 

PLEA OF THE HERALD. Tho Religious Herald devoted nearly a page in its issue of December 1-th to the college. The editorial is from the persuasive pen of Dr. A. E. Dickinson, the senior er.,tor. Speaking of the. work of the college in past years and the influence it is exerting through her sons in the world of affairs, Dr. Dickinson says: do where you will you will lind her sons, (.bio of them ("perhaps others) is away out in the Philippines, some are in China, one is in Japan, two are in Porto Rico. Every State in our great Union has felt and' rejoiced in their in lUienee. Go to tho Baptist, gatherings.

SORANTON, P.*.. Dec. 14.?The Ameri? can Federation of Labor, in the iast min? utes ot" this afternoon's sessi.>a. put R self on record on two questions that have been agitating the delegates since the convention convened ten days ago, namely: Trade autonomy and socialism. Tho greater of the two, in the mind's of most of the delegates, was that of au? tonomy. In brief, the special committee on au? tonomy, reeommena'eel that where there are only a few craftsmen In a largo in? dustrial concern, the best interests of *all concerned would be subserved by the few joining the paramount organization in such establishment, and the amalga? mation of sub-divided crafts into dis? trict and national trade councils, where all disputes should be settled. The. recommendations of the commit? tee, to the surprise of many, wero unan? imously adopted without a single remark being mafie by any one. The failure, of the socialist delegates to attack the substitute resolution was the surprise of the day. The socialists, in declining to take up the diseussion, explained that the convention had so much business to dispose of in the lim? ited time at its disposal they would not seize the opportunity at this time to show how socialism could cure the ills of hu? manity. Tho convention took up the greater part of the afterncon in the el.ectlpn of officers. All the officers were re-elected with Samuel Gompers pr?sident. New Orleans was selected as the next place of meeting. Tallahassee Southeastern Sold. (By Associate} lYcss.)
