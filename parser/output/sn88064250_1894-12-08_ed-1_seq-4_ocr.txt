He was sent to the Charity Hospital in New Or leans for treatment. C. Dietlein has everything you need for the holidays. The largest and most complete assortment of holiday goods in town, besides the best groceries, etc. Christmas is just two weeks off from next Tuesday. From what we can see at present it bids fair to be a very dull one for almost ev erybody. The scarcity of money and low price of cotton have de moralized people. The railroad company began on Tuesday last the erection of a new depot, to replace the old one de stroyed by fire some time ago. This move should have been made some time ago, for the traveling public has no doubt been put to a great deal of trouble and inconven ience by the bad accomodations since the destruction of the old building. Senator Newton C. Blanchard has introduced a bill in the Senate of the United States, that, if pass ed and signed, will give to the Louisiana sugar planters the boun ty for 1894. It is to be hoped that the bill will pass through Congress without any hitch or de lay, for the United States really owes the planters, and it should discharge itself of an honest debt. j Reuben F. Kolb, the notorious Alabama politician, who has run for Governor of that State for the past three elections aud been de feated each time, went through the formality of being sworn in on in auguration day last Monday, when 0 the Governor-elect, W. C. Oates, i took the oath of office and assumed t the responsibilities of the office. p Kolb, however, persists in saying that he is the Governor; that he is the choice of the people, and that he was defrauded out of the office. But, then, anyone who is $ acquainted with 2 'abama politics knows that Kolb is a political gas- n bag and is only blowing to hear him i% self talk, and to attract public at tention, and thereby gain a little potoriety. t 

ELECTION OF OFFICERS. The regular annual election ol officers of Humble Cottage Lodge No. 19, F. & A. M., was held in the hall of that body last Wednesday night, and the following were elect ed to serve for the year 1895: J. T. Skipper, W. M.; M. Guslinski, S. W.; I. E. Shute, J. W.; Joseph Bloch, Treasurer; Jonas Jacobs, Secretary; M. Depres, Chaplain; O. H. Terwilliger, S. D.; Max Klaus, J. D.; and W. M. Price, Tyler. The stewards will be appointed later on. Gordy Royal Arch Chapter No. 32 will elect officers on Sunday, Dec. 16th, at 10 a. m.; and on the same day James Ray Council No. 13, Royal and Select MIasters, will also elect officers. Opelousas Lodge No. 3497, Knights of Honor, held an enthu siastic meeting last Tuesday night, and after going through routine and secret work, renewed their ob ligation and elected the following officers for the year 1895: Thos. B. Brooks, Dictator; H. D. Larcade, Vice Dictator; W. A. Adams, As sistant Dictator; W. A. Sandoz, Reporter; S. Jacobs, Financial Re porter; P. DelBuono, Treasurer; P. D. Tatman, Chaplain; Jas. O. Ray, Guide; Jacob Vatter, Guardian; W. C. Perrault, Sentinel; Trustees, T. S. Fontenot, M. Guslinski and Ed gar Landry; B. F. Anderson, Rep resentative to the Grand Lodge, with S. Jacobs as alternate. t A PROMPT SETTLEMENT. The New York Life Insurance Co. paid on Dec. 3d the sum of $10, - 000 to the widow of the late Ben Meginley, under the policy taken out by him last January, only ten - months ago. Considering that the proofs of death only reached the home office of the company in New York on Nov. 24th, this is pretty prompt settlement, and evidences not only the liberality of the com 1 pany, but the security of the poli 1 cies which it issues. Mr. M. M. Kohlman, the special agent of the company who paid the money ov er to Mrs. Meginley, is at La combe's hotel for a few days, and will be glad to meet any residents of the parish who desire to avail themselves of the protection that only life insurance offers. The second session of the Fifty third Congress of the United States convened in Washington City last Monday, with both Houses having a quorum. After the reading of the President's message a little minor business was transacted and both Houses adjourned for the (lay. The message, except in a few points, was devoid of any interest. It was a lengthy document, and treated of various subjects. The only local issues treated of that would attract much attention was the advising of the President to place coal and iron on the free list, and a revision in the banking and currency laws. As will be seen in our corres pondence from Big Cane, published in another column of this issue, a sad and much-to-be-regretted acci dent occurred at that place last Saturday, which resulted in the death of Mr. John Haw. Mr. Haw and Mr. Hardin Hebert were hunt ing together, when, as the letter will explain, Mr. Hebert's gun ex ploded accidentally, and the charge of shot entered Mr. Haw's head, causing a wound from which he Numa Dudoussat, one of the crooked New Orleans councilmen, v after being on trial in the criminal court of that city for some time past, was convicted last Wednes Â© day on the charge of receiving a bribe of $100. This makes the se 1 cond conviction on the same charge in that city of late, and the remain ing indicted councilmen can well tremble in their boots at the "rocky" prospect that stares them in the face. The approach of the Christmas holidays has served to enliven things a little. Some of our mer chants are getting in quite a stock of goods and novelties, while others say that they will not carry any larger stock than they now have, as the "times are too hard." The usual fall term of the Civil District Court met in the court house last Monday, with Judge Perrault presiding. The first day's session attracted many visitors to town. The Grand Jury is also in session. J. B. Sandoz has the best quality of Pittsburg and Alabama Coal, which he delivers anywhere in the corporation at the lowest price. Nov. 17, 4t.
