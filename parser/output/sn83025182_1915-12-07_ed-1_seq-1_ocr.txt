PREPAREDNESS AND THE k-'fr [United Press Leased Wire Service.] WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—President Wilson made his tenth appearance in person before a joint session of con gress today. The lure of seeing the president, of bearing him urge his views on what is expected to be one of the most momentous sessions of congress in American history, drew crowds early to the capitol. Only 565 cards of ad mittance to the public galleries were Issued. Every one of them was used. Even the diplomatic and executive galleries were filled. By this time both the executive and Jiplomatic galleries had filled, like toe public galleries, to utmost capac ity. In the diplomatic gallery, foreign representatives were glad to sit in the aisles. The South and Central American republics were particularly Well represented. Among the diplomats were: The British ambassador, Japanese am bassador, Russian ambassador and Argentine ambassador and the minis ters from Persia, Panama, Salvador and Sweden. It was exactly 12:40 when the pres ident appeared. He was accorded a Prolonged ovation and out of the hum •f hand clapping, was heard the fa mous "rebel yell."

Pope Benedict's suggestions already have borne fruit.

He urged such measures "to do nothing less than save the honor ana aelf-respect-of• the nation."— The very vigor of the phrases seem intensified by the fact that the presi dent himself spoke them. "Corrupt systems," "ugly and incredible thing," "malign reaction," were some of his diatribes. The president said he need not sug gest the terms with which congress might take measure of preparedness against the situation he bared. "Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out," was his demand. "We should promptly make use of processes ot jaw by which we may be purged of their cor rupt distempers," he reiterated again. "The gravest threats against our na tional peace and safety have been ut tered within our borders,' he stated. At its closed he concluded: "No laws, I suppose, can reach cor ruptions of the mind and heart but I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and expressing the even deeper humiliation and scorn which every self possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon us."

Relations Between United States and Germany are Closer to an Open Rupture Than Any Time Since War Began. OVER RECALL OF TWO OFFICIALS [United Press Leased Wire Service.] WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Relations between the United States and Ger many today are nearer breaking down than at any time since the war be gan, or Germany is making a colossal diplomatic blufT. The outcome is un certain, with serious eventualities possible. A breach of diplomatic relations with the recall of Ambassador Bern storff possibly voluntarily by his own government, was gravely discussed. Officials were hopeful, however, over the present proceedure. Unless it reaches the stage of an exchange of notes directly betwen the Berlin for ign office and stute department, the administration hopes for a solution that will prevent a diplomatic broach. The deadlock over Germany's de mands for reasons prompting this government asking t*he recall of Cap tains Boy Ed and Von Papen, showed little signs of an immediate solution today. Secretary Lansing is adman ant on the proposition that this gov ernment is not required to state Its reasons and that the mere facts it In dicates Von Papen and Boy-Ed are persona non grata makes acquescenco by Germany in their recall, impera tive. State department officials were today bending their energies to avoid flat disagreement on this proposition. Most of ail the department wishes to avoid curt and summary dismissal of the two embassy attaches, the only recourse left open, if Germany should squarely and flatly refuse to detach them. It was explained that Lansing statement to Bernstorff that the re quest for the recalls was for "mili tary" reasons, was voluntary and not required by this government under diplomatic etiquette. Another angle of the dlsputo was the position taken by Ambassador Bernstorff that Germany is not re quired to ask for safe conduct for (he two attaches, but that it is incum bent upon the United States to insure their safe return to Germany. Lan sing has said flatly that this govern ment by international usage is re quired only to provide safe conduct for the attaches across the U. S. bor der or as far as the three mile limit at sea.
