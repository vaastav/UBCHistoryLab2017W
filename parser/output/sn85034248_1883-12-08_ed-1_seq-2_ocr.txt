Old Probabiliti.n;'s 'a there i a frigid wave coming itand that the present rains will be succeeded by clear, cold weather. A kitchen building belonging to Auguste Degas, at College Point, was destroyed by fire Monday night of last week. The Creole FLresde reports that the fire was caused by a lighted cigarette imprudently thrown into a trash box. Mr. Ed. N. Bertheand, the former first baseman of the old Burnside Base Ball Club of this place, who has been in Texas for some months past earning new laurels on theldiamond field, unexpectedly dropped in on us this morning, having just returned to St. James from his trip to the Lone Star State. Ed. is looking finely and speaks in high terms of ouseton pd' Texas generally. Miss Clara Keating has returned from her visit to Baton Rouge after a most en. Joyable sojourn in that pleasant little city, and is warmly welcomed home by her rel atives and friends. From the Weekly Tuth we copy the following compliment ary "personal: " Miss Clara Keating, alovely and accomplished young lady, of Donaldsonville, who has been visiting the Misses McGrath, of this oity, for the last three eeks, returned to her home on last Buday. The young lady was much ap. pleeoiated by a large number of newly made friends and admihers, who iregAtted exceeding ly her departure, and were only coesoled by the promise of another visit from her shortly. The family of Capt, C. P. Truslow of the Red River and Coast Line made a round trip on the Jesse K. Bell recently, just be fore that steamer was transferred from the New Orleans and Plaquemine trade back to Red river. The party consisted of the Cap tain's wife, Mrs. Q. P. P. Tlow, his daugh ters, Mine Cora and Annabel Truslow, his stepdaughter, Miss Edna Perrin, and two lady friends of the family, Mrs. Tarrant and Miss Aim6e Tarrant. The ladies appeared to derive much enjoyment from their ex cursion. We were misinformed, it seems, concern ing the nature of the indisposition from which Mr. Henry C. Wilson, manager of the Palo Alto plantation, is suffering. We had understood that he waQ prostrated by the effects of a severe cold, but we have more recently learned that he slipped and fell in the sugar-house, wrenching his thigh so seriously that he has been confined to the house and. can only walk with the aid of ortiiehes. He ventfired outlastMon day soonier than he should have done, and the indiscretion has somewhat retarded his recovery. The Terpsichorean Social Club will begin preparations next week for the grand fancy dares ball to be given by that organization on the 8th of January. The affair promises, to be one of exceptional brilliance, as we hear there will be adisplay of fine costumes by some of the young men as well as the ladies, a number of the former proposing to rig themselves up in:;the ;style of our grandfather's days and personate great men,of ye olden time. Every ticket will have a numbered coupon attached entitling the holder to a chance in the raffle of a val nable gift that will take place during the ball. The arrangements will be all that can be desired for such an affair. Cosonlss.-The Forty-eighth Congress assembled at Washington I:la' Monday in regular session. Mr. Carlisle, the nominee of the Democratic caucus, was elected Speaker, the Republican members casting their votes for ex-Speaker Keifer. The re organization of the Senate has not yet ta ken place and no date therefor has been fixed upon. The President's message was received and read and a number of bills have been introduced, being mostly meas ures of a private character. The message contains little worthy of special note, the satisfactory condition of the country not affording material for any thing startling or novel is the executive communication. Several matters will be made the subjects of special messages, among them the im provement of the Mississippi river. LoDno NOTES.-At next Tuesday's meet ing of Lee Lodge, A. O. U. W., officers for the ensuing term will be nominated and the merits of a new goat tested. The presence of every member is desired. The officers nominated next Tuesday will be formally elected at the last meeting in December and installed at the first meeting in January. 3 As the fourth Tuesday of this month will be Christmas day, the lodge has applied for permission to change the date of the second December meeting. The Knights of Honor and Knights of Pythias also elect otlicers this month, the former on the third Tuesday and the latter on the last Thursday. Two candidates were initiated in the rank of Page at the meeting of Kenneth Lodge, I K. of P., this week. Ascension Council No. 816, American Legion of Honor, meets to-night. Eddie Butler and Frank Thomas, two t young colored men, had a quarrel at Blue Bucket Exchange, the evening of Nov. 10, with a man of their own color, a re- t cent comer here, and meeting him at the Market-House later in the evening they set upon him and beat him viciously with a s'icks, bruising him about the head and t face quite severely. Thomas succeeded in escaping arrest and got out of town, but s Eddie was not so lucky, and now lies in the b parish jail unable to furnish a bond of $200 u for the assault and battery and $100*r the - additional offense of carrying concealed a weapons. He tried to get away and very nearly succeeded, boarding a bayou boat at R the wharf and going as far as the railroad ti bridgee, where an officer went aboard and a captured him. Eddie has been involved in w several sqluabbles and has shown rather I bi too great a readiness to use his club. Nu I doubt hIs present trouble will have a ten- i dieney to make lhi moie discreet in that I u HOW IT
