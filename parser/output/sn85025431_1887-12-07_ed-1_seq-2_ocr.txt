Arensdorfa Counsel Examines the Last of th*1 Witnesses In His Behalf-Evidence In Rebuttal A 1'romlnent Witness for the State Deals a Death-Blow to the Alibi Theory. Sioux CITY, Ia, Nov. 29.—The Arensdorf trial dragged slowly yesterday "morning, only six witnesses being examined. Adolph Neppei testified that in buying Mrs. Bis­ marck's house John Arensdorf had merely acted as his agent, he (Nepper) not being on good termB with the Bismarck's. Will­ iam Hiles swore to the good character of Arensdorf, and to the bad charaoter of Leavitt. Lee Longworthy, a new wit­ ness, formerly the night clerk of the Mad­ ison House, on Third street, swore that on the night of the murder, shortly after the shot was firod, Paul Leader and another man came around the corner of Water and Third streets, and went east past the Madison toward the Milwaukee house. This sup­ ports Leader's evidence and contradicts Bismarck's. Juhl, the Dane, says it was not Arensdorf, but Leavitt. who fired the shot Sioux CITY, Ia, Nov. 30.—Very important and seemingly reliable evidence was given In the Arensdorf. case yesterday morning, all tending to establish an alibi.' Rob­ ert Buchanan, a small boy, who was early at the scene of the murder, and who was sent for t'r.e doctor, swore that Arensdorf, with whom he was well acquaint­ ed, was not In the crowd that went west from Junk's saloon, but that Leavitt was. Lewis HagenolB, now of Milwaukee, former­ ly cook at the Shepherd restaurant here, testified that, on the night of the murder Arensdorf got supper about 9:30 o'clock in the restaurant Afterward he and ArenBdorf shook dice for the drinks at tbe bar in front of the restaurant. Corson, proprietor of the Cataract House, Sioux Falls, ate supper at the restau­ rant He was looking for a cook and had his eye on Hagenois, and when Carson fin­ ished supper he walked into the saloon. He saw Hagenois and a man shaking dice. He watched them to find what sort of company his prospective cook kept Carson passed out and had just st. pped onto the walk when the shot was fired He can toot state definitely who it was that was shaking dloe with Hagenois, but says it was a man of the same build as Arensdorf and dressed like he was that night Sioux CITY, Ia Nov. 30.—In the Arensdorf trial on Tuesday Fritz Folger, never before on the stand in this oase, the man charged by Bismarck with having bought him a ticket to San Francisco and given him $9o of Arensdorf's money, dented under oath all these transactions. Sylvester Granda, whom Bismarck alleges was his compatriot, then took the stand He denied in the main Bismarck's story, yet acknowledged that overtures had been made to him to whip Haddock. He claimed to have refused to do the job and that be was at home when the murder occurred. Sioux CITY, Ia, Dec. L—John Arensdorf, who 18 on trial here for the murder of Bev. Mr. :ddock, took the witness stand In his own defense Wednesday after­ noon. He testified that he did not see the crowd of men who were looking for Haddock, including Thieber, Piatt. Leavitt, and Peters, except for a few minutes in Junk's Baloon that they went out before he did, and that he did. not know where they went, and that he went from Junk's across the street to .the Shephard saloon, and thence to the "English Kitchen." His former testimony was to the effect that he went directly from Junk's to the "Kitch­ en." Arensdorf further testified that while at Sherman's place, the "Kitchen," he heard ttdk of some one having been shot down on Water street, and having gone there learned for tne first time of Haddock's murder. Sioux CITY, Ia, Dec. 2 —The defense in the Haddock murder case rested yester­ day morning immediately afier the cross examination of John Arensdorf The de­ fendant, in explaining the differences be­ tween his alibi testimony in this trial and that in his first trial, said that he had forgotten much. The State began its re­ butting tqptimony. E. Bradenlurg swore that about ten dayB before the murder of Haddock, Arensdorf, the defendant, said that he would head a mob at any time to drive out the Prohibiiionista Sioux CITY, Ia, Dec. 2.—In the Arensdorf trial on Thursday Six witnesses from Monti ce.lo, Ia, sworo that the general moral char­ acter of Mrs Potter, one ofjthe witnesses for tin- sfense, was bad. G. H. Cummings testi­ fied that J. H. Taylor toid him ihat Arens­ dorf had left the Shepherd saloon the night of the murder in plenty of time to go to Junk's saloon and to get to the place where Mr. Haddock was murdered. Taylor is the witness who testified that Arensdorf was in the Shepherd saloon at about the time of the murder. Sioux CITY, Ia, Dec. .3.—Yesterday was one of the most important in the trial* of John Arensdorf for the murder of Bev. George C. Haddock. A large number of witneeses were examined, contradicting and impeaching the main witnesses for the defense. The climax was reaohed when ffdn. Byron Webster, of Dubuque, United States revenue collector, took the stand and tes ifled that from about 10 o'olock till the fatal shot was fired on the night of the murder he was in the Shepherd saloon and restaurant that he got his supper there, and that Arensdorf was not thera The evidence was positive. The Importance of this evidence consists in the faot thas the Shepherd saloon is the place where Arensdorf located himself at tbe mo­ ment of the murder, and for some time be­ fore, and is the vital point of the alibi NATURAL GAS EXPLOSIONS.

CiNCDJNiUn, Deo. 3.—In tbe Harper trial yesterday, General Eugene F. Powell, Na­ tional Bank examiner, testified He had examined the books of the Fidelity on March 17, 1887, and found every thing straight On June 15, being alarmed by rumors as to the bank's connection with the wheat deal, he appeared to make a seo­ ond examination. He was begged by Harper to pass the examination, and was then asked to telegraph to the Comptroller of thejCurrenoy for authority to not rnflVa the examination, but he still refused He then made an examination, and found three certificates of deposit, aggregating $700, 500, bearing no data There were no en­ tries of these certificates on the books. General Powell on June 20 notified the directors that to much of their resources had been wasted tbat he would be com­ pelled to close the bank. Paul B. Ashbrook, the book-keeper for In­ dividual accounts of the Fidelity Bank, had charge of Harper's Individual account, and said Harper's account was frequently over­ drawn. At one time in May it was over­ drawn $16,000.' The witness read the fluctuations of Harper's and other accounts' In which he was interested from January to June. ^Nearly all were overdrawn at some time. Brlggs Swift, the venerable president of the late Fidelity Bank, was asked if he knew his bank was engaged in a wheat deal. "I did not," was his blunt answer: He then went on to say that he asked Harper in January )ast if he was in the wheat deal and Harper said he had not a dollar in it Later he sent him a letter asking him the same question, and he replied by letter saying he had no interest whatever in the matter, and If any man said he had he was a liar. Con­ tinuing, Mr. Swift said: "When the public began to suspect the Fidel­ ity Bank and I wanted to restore confidence, 1 went to the bank with Mr. Richard Smith, o! the Gazette, who has known me for years, and together we catechized Harper on the subject, and he denied it. Then Mr. $mlth, upon my assurance and upon Harper's express state­ ment, wrote an editorial denying tbat tbe Fi­ delity Bank was mixed up in the affair. This was but a few days before the failure."

TO BE BEAD ON TQVBTFXR. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Several hours' time will be spent in organizing the House next Monday, and so it has been arranged not.to send President Cleveland's annual message to Congress until Tuesday. The Sec­ retary of the Treasury has completed his report, and is engaged at his home in arranging the topics in order. The Secretary of War has been closeted at Ids home since his return engaged on his report Chief Clerk Twee dale has been assisting him a good deal of the time The finishing touches are being made to the report,, and it will probably be made public Monday morning. Secretary Whitney has been able to give but a few days work to his report, and, although it will nocbe along one, it will be several days before it is completed. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. a —Secretary Fairchild has completed the preparation of his nnnnal report to Congress, and the final pages were placed in the printers' hands yesterday. He has been engaged on this work almost exclusively for a month. The report is all in the Secretary's own hand-writing, and gives his views in regard to the surplus and tariff at considerable length. It will be made public immediately after its presenta­ tion to Congress Wednesday afternoon. NEW YOBK, Dec. &—A Washington special to the Tribune says: "The President at the meeting of the Cabinet Thursday submitted the rough draft of Ids forthcoming an­ nual message to Congress. It wa» fully and freely discussed for nearly four hours, and will again be sub­ mitted on Friday to tbe Cabinet in the form in which it is to be sent to Congress. Meanwhile speculation is rife as to the con­ tents of what will probably be one of the longest official documents ever written by Mr. Cleveland Tiiosewho know say that it will contain approximately twenty-two thousand words. From excellent sources it is ascertained that Mr. Bayard's department will absorb the lion's share of the President's message. He will announce in the tirst place either the result of the labors of tbe fisheries com­ mission or the fact that they are still at work. There is an Inifp 1 iiinii prevailing that the commission will sit for the last time on Saturday next The message indi­ cates that the negotiation of a new treaty has been found impracticable—« result said to be favored by Mr. Bayard, who is repre­ sented as despairing of getting a treaty acted npon by the Senata in its present tem­ per. What the President wiil probably be able to announce in his message is that the commission has agreed npon an interpreta­ tion of the treaty of 1818. A revision of the naturalization lawB, the establishment of a central bureau for the registration of naturalized citizens, and a hint as to the advisability of restricting by federal statute immigration of an nndesir able kind are among the theories discussed by the President in view of the recent Anarchist demonstrations in various parts of the country. Regarding the tariff and other questions of finance the President will have little to say, the present plan being, it is said, to let the Secretary of the Treasury deal with both questions at length in his annual report. In a general and very guarded way the President recommends, it is understood, a liberal enlargement of the free list, men­ tioning, however, by name, none of the articles which, in his opinion, ought to be placed thera Upon the wording df this part of the message much care and atten­ tion have been bestowed. Among those' to whom it has been read, outside of the members of the Cabinet, are Messrs. Car­ lisle, Scott and Waterson. SJr. Bandall has been given no opportunity to inspect it, it is said A codification of the banking laws, amended in the manner proposed by the Comptroller of the Currency, is recom­ mended The President, it is thought, will in a cau­ tious way recommend a Lberal system of appropriations for the improvement of the Mississippi river. He will likewise suggest, it is believed, that appropriations for this river be made separately and not, as hereto­ fore in the River and Harbor bill, which he has always regarded as an object of suspic­ ion, more or less. The repeal of the Pre-emption and Timber-cu.ture acts is urged in the strong­ est terma The necessity of preserving the National forests is also pointed out The Pacific railroads, it is understood, will be the subject of a special message to Congress later on.
