BEEN SHAMED BY TREASON OF SOME CITIZENS Asserts Country Needs Statutes to Deal With Those Who; Try to Plant Europe's War Passions Within Its Borders. President Wilson read the following message today to the Senate and House of Representatives in joint assembly: GENTLEMEN OF. THE CONGRESS : Since I last bad the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea. which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the whole face Df international affairs and now presents a prospect of-^reorganization and reconstruction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in the policies Which seem to have brought the conflict on; it was neces sarv. if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a limit! ?should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some part of the gr|at family of nations should keep the processes of peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the breakdown throughout the world of the industries by which its populations are fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the self-gov erned nations of this hemisphere to redress, if possible, the balance of economic loss and confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day of readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service. Duties of American States. Tn this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate life * rid their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe, but also by a clear peremption of international duty, the states of America have become con scious of a new and more vital com munity of interest and moral partner ship in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common sympathies and Interests and duties which bid them stand tog-ether. There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the re publics fighting their way to independ f rr#- in Central anti South America ?? ben the government of the United States iook*?i upon itself as in some common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or community"; that "of all the various rpodes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safe ty. and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministra tion; and that, when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, in alienable and indefeasible right to re form, alter or abolish it in such man ner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhes itatingly applied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hope fully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy j from any outside quarter in the radi- j cal but necessary process. We will aid j ? ry t the guardian of the republics to | and befriend Mexico, but we will not i t ' south of her a* against any en- {coerce her: and our course with regard j ?r-o or effort* at political con- {to her ought to be sufficient proof to! t-ro f-oid the other side of the water: tall America that we seek no political! frit, it its duty to play the part even , suzerainty or selfish control. w it'out invitation from them: and I i think tha? we can claim that the task j What Pan-Americanism Is. was undertaken with a true and disin- { , . terested enthusiasm for the freedom i "?oral is that the states of Amer ict are not hostile rivals but co operating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat-! ters economic, is likely to give them a new- significance as factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as 1 in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, stand- ? of the Americas and the unmolested self-government of her independent peoples.

But it was always difficult to main tain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose freedom of *?'tion we sought to protect, and with out provoking serious misconceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful , . .. ? . . , . . , i?'ig together because thinking togeth-j man of affairs must welcome the al- qUjok with common sympathies and' te:e?l <-ir*Mimstances of the new day in J common ideals.

Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the state* of Central and South America is not altered. We re tain unabated the spirit that has in spired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make s common cause of national independ ence and of political liberty iri Amer ica , But that purpose is now better understood so far 'as it concerns our selves. It h* known not to be a selfish purpose. It is known to have in it no thought of taking advantage of any -ovc-rmrenl in this hemisphere or play f.u its political fortnnes for our own it' 1,rfit. All the governments of Amer ica stand, so far as we are concerned, upon a footing of genuine equality and unquestioned independence. Put to Test in Mexico. We have been put to the test in the ??se of Mexico, and jre. have stood the Vest. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re luains to be seen. Jler fortunes .are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take ad vantage of'her In her distress and'un dertake to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is often a fierce and intract able th;n^. to which no bounds can be | ?el. and to which no bounds of ;? few ? men's choosing ought ever to be set. Kver> American who 11a:; drunk at the true fountains of principle and tradi tion must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Virginia bill of rights, which in the great days in* which our government was set up wu everywhere amongst us accepted aa the creed of free men. That doetrlne is, "That government is. or ought to be, instituted for the peaceful destiny. This is 1'an-Americanism. It has I none of the spirit of empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual em bod 1- : ment. of the spirit of law and inde pendence and liberty and mutual serv ice. A very notable body of men recently | met in the city of Washington, at the invitation and as the guests of thi^j government, whose deliberations are likely to be looked back to as mark ing a memorable turning point in the; history of America. They were repre sentative spokesmen of the several in dependent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of the republics of the two continents which nature and political fortune have so intimately linked together. I ear nestly recommend to your perusal the reports of'flfeir proceedings and of the actions of their committees. You will . get. from them. I think, a fresh con ception of the ease and intelligence and advantage with which. Americans of both continents may draw together in practical co-operation and of what the material foundations of this hopeful partnership of interest must consist? of how we should build them and of how necessary it is that we should hasten their building. Drawing the Americas Together. There is. I venture to point out, an especial significance just now attach ing to this whole .matter of drawing the Americas together in bonds of hon orable partnership and mutual advan tage because of the economic readjust ments which the world must inevitably witness within the next generation, when peace shall have at last resumed its healthful taska. In the perform ance of these tasks I believe the Amer icas to be destined to play their parts together. I am interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you ta^ce it within your view (.Continued on Fourteenth Page.)

PAN-AMERICANISM INTERESTS DIPLOMATS Woman Suffrage Demonstration, Feared and Prepared for by Officials, Fails to Occur. A new doctrine of pan-Ameri canism, which may be considered as the twentieth century out growth of the Monroe doctrine, was urged by President Wilson in his address today to the joint ses sion of the two houses of Con gress. In it he places American ism for the western hemisphere above every other consideration, and in words of bitterness de nounces those of foreign birth who have sought to entangle their adopted country in the Eu ropean snarl. Running through the address was the theme of preparedness, the President's strongest recom mendations being used to back the plans and estimates of the Navy and War Departments sent to Congress yesterday. Plans to Increase Revenue. Coincident with the national defense plans, the President laid down his pro posals for meeting the added millions of expense, and suggested taxes on in comes, gasoline, naphftia, automobiles, fabricated iron and steel and on bank checks. He opposed the sale of bonds. The task of building a merchant mi rine, he said, must soon be undertaken privately. In the meantime he urged the government control of merchant ships, saying that when trade had thus be*n established the government would withdraw. . In lashing foreign-born intriguers President Wilson said: "There are citizens of the United States, i blush to admit, born under other flags, but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of Amer ica. who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life: who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought It effective for their vindictive pur poses, to strike at them and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign in trigue." Special Laws Are Needed. federal laws exist to meet this sit uation. said >Ir. Wilson, because such a thing would have seemed incredible in the past. "Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy," be added, "must be crushed out. They are not many but thev are infinitely maiign nant. and the hand of our power sl:oul<i close over them at once." On the subject of pan-Americanism lie said "Tile states of America are not hostile rivals, but <*>-operating friends and their growing sense of community interest, alike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in international affairs and in the political i history of the world. '?War Is Disciplined Might." Speaking of the proposed increase in fighting strength, he said: ' "BU* war has never been a mere mat ter of men and ar-n? It is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever t<> light effectively upon a sud den summons, tney must know how modern lighting >? done, and what to do when the summons comes to render ihemselves immediately available and immediately effective And the gov ernment must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care or themselves and of it.

I The House galleries were packed three hours before the time for Presi dent Wilson to deliver his address, and I hundreds of disappointed ones who had I failed to get the coveted tickets of ad ! mission lined the'corridors of the Cap I itoi and stood on the plaza outside to 'get a glimpse of the President as he passed in. , There were unusual arrangements to nreserve order. Only those who had tickets of admission were permitted to no to the upper galleries and an elus ive rumor or some sort of a woman suffragist demonstration brought out extra guards which sprinkle among the spectators and in the corridors i through which the President had to I ?.1SS \ number of men were placed at remanding positions in the galleries con Had Examined Precedents.

"CONGRESS SHOULD BE FAIR TO D. C." Senator Smith ot Maryland Says Residents Ought Not to Bear Entire Burden. WOULD MAKE CAPITAL FINEST IN THE WORLD i South Dakota Senator Declares That His Constituent Faror Expendi- ' tures to Beautify Washington. "I believe that Congress should' be most fair to the people of the District of Columbia," said Sena tor John Walter Smith of Mary land today, discussing the situa tion in the light of the investiga tion which is being made by the joint select committee of Con gress on the fiscal relations be tween the United States and the District. While the committee' assignments of the Senate have not yet been announced, it is un-I derstood that Senator Smith will be retained as chairman of the Senate District committee. Senator Smith said that in view of the fact that the joint select committee is still a work framing its report after extensive hearings and the consideration of a great mass of data, lie did not. feel that he would be justified in declaring] himself for any particular plan of appropriating for the District at this time. "Should Make Capital Beautiful." "This investigation should do much to clear the atmosphere and to bring about a fair solution of the difficulties which have arisen over the District of Columbia in Congress in recent years," continued Senator Smith. He insisted that Congress should deal generously with the National Capital. "This should be made the most beau tiful capital in the world." he said, "and I am sure that, we all hope that it will be made so. Never have I heard among my constituents the slightest objection to appropriations made from the federal Treasury for the benefit of the capital." Senator Smith said that it would be manifestly unfair to put all of the bur den of paying for the upkeep of the National Capital on the shoulders of the residents of the District. "The streets of the city are built on a scale that the people themselves would never think of having were it not for the fact that Washington is being laid out on large lines suitable for the capital of the nation. It must be remembered also that we do all we can to discourage the establishment of industrial enterprises here, choosing rather to make this a city of resi dences with the government's business ibe ?entral feature. ? Of course, this tends to decrease largely the basis of assessment in the Distinct. No man. Senator Smith saTd. should j dodge or be allowed to dodge his: proper taxes.

He said that during' the ] summer he had made several addresses j in his state on the subject of Wash I ington. the National Capital, and that I he had found his audiences most in terested in the development of the Capital city. Favors Fixed Ratio. "In rio case did the people think of resenting the appropriation of govern ment 'fund*,for the District," said Sen ator Sterling. "In fact, it was jujit the other way. The people seemed glad that something was being done for tlie capital." Senator Sterling is firmly convinced that Congress should appropriate a fixed ratio of the money for the ex penses of the District from the federal Treasury. The indefinite plan of ap I propriating for the District, as sug gested by Senator Works, the District Commissioners and others, Senator Sterling is convinced, would not work cither to the advantage of the people of the District or of the people of the entire country. "The plan to have the federal gov ernment pay all the expenses of the District, and have the people of the ! District pay taxes directly into the J ! federal Treasury is Utopian." he said. I "I am afraid that it would lead to the payment of all the expenses of the capital by the residents of the District, which would be manifestly unfair, and second, that it would hinder the de velopment of the city as the National Capitol should be developed." germansMkegains BY

FIRM FOR REFORM LAWS FOR DISTRICT Commissioners Will Send Sep arate Bills Providing Changes Urged in Estimates. . PROPOSALS DEEMED HIGHLY IMPORTANT Besides Other Things. Establish ment of Separate License Bnreau May Be Advocated. Impressed with the necessity for the new legislation recom mended in their estimates, the District Commissioners will send to Congress separate bills provid ing for the proposed reforms, the must important of which are abolishment of the board of edu cation and board of charities and vesting of tiie powers held by these bodies in the Commis sioners. Other legislative changes which the estimates recommend in the interest of economy and good government and which are to be sought in separate measures are the consolidation of the water department under District con trol; establishment of annual in place of triennial assessments, and appoint ment of the register o.f wills by the Supreme Court and recorder of deeds by the Commissioners instead of by the President. Will.Act as Safeguard. While these reforms may be accom plished through the appropriation act separate bills will be introduced as a safeguard, f??r the Commissioners are determined to spare 110 efforts to bring about legislation which they deem of the greatest importance to the Dis trict. Another big legislative change under contemplation which is not mentioned in the estimates, but will likely be sought in a separate bill, is the estab lishment of a license bureau as a sep arate and distinct branch of the local government. At present, licenses are handled under the direction and control of the assessor's office. With the es tablishment of the bureau it also is proposed to make a change In licensing methods and license fees. The changes will be directed toward bringing about an equalization of fees. As regards the Great Falls proposal, the Commissioners have not decided upon a course of action, but they will either soiHl to Congress a bill recom mending this improvement or submit a report incorporating their views upon some other bill to be introduced in rela tion to this subject.

PARTICULARS REFUSED BY U. S. Secretary Lansing Declines to Elaborate Boy-Ed and Von Papen Charges. DECISION IS TO STAND REGARDLESS OF BERLIN Other Seasons for Recall Than Those Mentioned Unnecessary. Says State Department. PRESIDENT APPROVES NOTE Copy of Communication Cabled to Ambassador Gerard. Who Is Deal ing Directly With For eign Office. Secretary Lansing has replied to Germany that the American government's request for the withdrawal oT Capt. Boy-I?d and Capt. von Papen. the naval and military attaches, respectivelv, of the German embassv here, was entirely because of their militarv and naval activities. Secretary Lansing s replv to tire, German government's in quiry. which indicated ^he Berlin | foreign office intended to contest the withdrawal of the attaches under certain conditions, was de livered in a long communication, which tile German embassv im mediately forwarded to Berlin. At the embassy all comment on it was refused. President Wilson has fullv ap proved Secretary Lansing's de cision. and it was said authorita tively today it will be adhered to no matter what Germany does. Other Seasons Intimated. Neither was there any indication of whether (he reply would meet the con tention of the German government that it should know the reasons for the request for the withdrawal of its of ficers. It was broadly intimated to the State Department that if the request was | based on something else than the de velopments of the Hamburg-American line conspiracy trial or the case of James F. J. Archibald, the American war correspondent who secretlv carried dispatches for Capt. von Papen Ger many would decline to withdraw'either of the men. Tenor of Secretary's Reply. The general impression was that Sec retary Lansings reply at some length repeats that the two officers have be come persona non grata because of their military and naval activities, an-" that, further, under the diplomatic usages existing between nations, it is unnecessary for one government to do more than intimate to another that d/sta^UfulCe ?f a d,plomatic omcer is a?v|ees from Berlin indi wom?i ?i j Uern,an government would withdraw the officers as re pealed. although it might press for a bill of particulars. The position of the State Department is tlmt it will not discuss the facts in the case nor reve.il the sources of its information which have led to the decision that the ac tivities of the two German attaches make their presence in this countrv no longer desirable. Investigation Is Still On. The Department of Justice is still In vestigating reports that German agents were back of alleged plans for a counter revolution in Mexico to be headed by Gen. Huerta. Attorney Gen eral Gregory said today, however that no new information on the subject had been called to his attention recently One reason why the American gov ernment wil! not furnish German, with specific reasons for the request for the recall of Capt.

Secretary Lansing also sent a reply to Germany through Ambassador Ger ard at Berlin. In making its inquiry Germany also used two avenues of communication, the German ambassa dor here and the American ambassador in Berlin. While there was no indication today that the text of Secretary Lansing's communication would be made public it can be said authoritatively that it declares tile American government's action was caused by the military and nava! activities of the attaches <-ou pied with circumstances of an accumu lative nature which are deemed suffi cient for Secretary Lansing's action These also are responsible. No men tion was made of Mexican affairs nor did the name of (Jen. Huerta appear. Emphasis on Their Activities. The German government was in formed, however, that an accumulation of circumstances and conditions by in ference. if not otherwise, connected the attaches with attempts to violate the neutrality laws of the United States. Emphasi" placed 011 the statement that military and naval activities alone were considered was taken to indicate that other German officials were not In any way concerned. Secretary Lansing is understood to have conferred with President Wilson before dispatching the reply. It was understood the Secretary thought that under the circumstances tiie State De partment might well inform the Ger man government of the principal causes of its action, without, of course, going into a discussion of the facta, or dl (Continued on Fifth Pa^> ?
