PUBLIC LIBRARY. Interest In the public library seems to be Increasing. Of roure, here, as elsewhere, there are "knockers" to be found always , ready to writleUe, generally without caue, but often from pre-concved prejudice, or from the habit of finding fault, which seems to run In the blood with some people. Such persons can never be pleatd If the sun shines they complain that It Is too hot; If clouds come they want sunhlne, and so on to the end of the calendar of wos they carry about for public exhibition at oppor tune times. But the fc-rat body of the public, the men and women ho build towns and cities, who promote enterprises for the benefit of the com munity where they live, to use a slang phrase, "are not built that may," and to such It Is ft source of real pleasure to note the progress of all Institu tions, religious, humane or education al for the' betterment of mankind. The records of the librarian show that for November 1237 books were loaned and read. maiy of i hern by boys and girls from twelve to twenty years cf age, thus introducing into numerous families wholesome Influ ences. Many ft Loy and girl will ac quire a taste for reading from the opportunities of this library. Dozens of mothers In Las Vegas are rejoicing that there Is a place where their children may go for a llesure hour under healthy moral and literary con ditions. As some evidence of the growing popularity of the library it may be stated that 12S7 persons vlHited ttio I library last month.' This Is an aver age of over forty per day, many of I whom remained for hours reading books, magazines and newspapers. Recognizing the value of such an Institution, a large number of ladles met some time ago at the library building and took preliminary steps to make a perfect organization. Yesterday there waa ft further meet ing at which a constitution was adopt ed, officers elected, and the organ ization perfected. The following la dies signed ' the constitution ; Mrs. Vollmer, Mrs.' McCIanahan, Mrs. Har riet Van Petten, Mrs. W.R.Tlpton, Mrs. Dillon, Mrs. .Larkln, Mrs. Ryan, Mrs. Will Rosenthal, Mrs. S. C.

The Optic congratulate the public upon the organization 'of this new as sociation to work ' In the Interest of the library, for -Its growth and up building and to widen!, and - broaden the sphere of Us Influence. , These women and the object for which they are wbrklng are . entitled to the earnest support of Las . Vegas. With the cooperation of , the city council and the library board they will make the library a positive force for the public good. ' . . " t : . -, The beautlAll assembly hall at the library building, with Ts bright sun light during, the day and electric light' Ing In the evening, wtTh books, peri odicals and newspapers, is ft pleasant place to which ' our young people should be encouraged to go.
