THE TOPEEA DAILT CTATH JOTOITAIr-DATTTCD A Y EVEHIITO. DZCZIlDZli & 1C13- 8 POLITICAlGOSSIP Now Believed Hodges Wont Bun for Senate. That Would Relieve Democratic Tension. ' ! ' EE TCPIE-CORED FISHT Farrellj, Brown and Waggener Neeley, Maybe. - Fomrth District Bepnblleans to Meet In Emporia. That Governor Hodges will be a can didate for re-election next year and will not take chips in the United States senatorial flgnt. is the opinion of the men who bear distinction of being close to the administration and Its af fairs. As for Governor Hodges, he has said nothing about his plans for pub lication. In fact he will probably make no definite statement for some weeks. Just now the close friends of Gover nor Hodges believe that the Democratic senatorial war Is at an end and that the administration can adjust its po litical troubles without serious diffi culty. Two avowed candidates are in the race and two more may enter. But In neither event will It cause serious complications within the Democratic party. W. L. (Ironjaw) Brown has been an avowed senatorial candidate since last winter. Hugh P. Farrelly announced his candidacy after spend ing four days In Topeka recently and holding many conferences with the gov ernor. And it is generally assumed that Farrelly will not be opposed by the administration, even though Hodges shows some favoritism for Brown as an evidence of appreciation for Ma work as sneaker in the MM session of the house. Of course Senator Balie P. Wag- saner, of Atchison, may become an active candidate and a good many Dera ocrats already regard Col. "Bill" Sapp of Galena as a senatorial candidate, although the Democratic national com mitteeman has made no definite state' ment about his plans. Of course Bapp and the Hodges forces are not on In timate terms, but in a three or four cornered fight, it is hardly probable that the administration would wage open warfare against the Galena Dera ocrat. But in a two cornered fight between Brown and Farrelly. the state would see a pretty contest. Brown has been working hard. He hasn't missed an opportunity to push his candidacy in the ten months he has been in the race and he ras made many speeches and shook hands with many voters. On the other hand Farrelly is a can didate to be reckoned with and holds a positive strength in every county in the state. Of course Waggoner and ftun are vet to be considered. Both men -are truni uiv ecutii u - environ. j the state and their candidacies would perhaps strengthen rather than weak en the chances for Brown's nomina tlon. - . Hodges wants, to- stay out of the senatorial . fights it. is reported. Of course he - would like to go to the United . States senate, -but that . would mean a row within the party which would threaten its chances for success in the November election and Hodges' friends have urged him to stay in the gubernatorial contest in order to maintain as much harmony as possible in the coming campaign. As for the Neeley candidacy, it is reported that the Seventh district congressman will soon make a state' ment in which he will declare himself for re-election to congress and will not take a hand In the senatorial fight. With the apparent clearing up of the senatorial muddle, it is probable that iveeiey wouia win a renommation without opposition and his chances for re-election are perhaps stronger than those of any other Democratic congressman In the state.- Find Job for Beaton. ' It Is rumored In the state house that Sam Seaton, pardon and parole clerk and official press agent for Governor Hodges, is to be promoted. Seaton is slated for elevation to a 12,600 Job as attorney to the public utilities com mission, and Senator J. W. Howe, secretary to the board of control, is listed for Seaton's Job in the gover nor's office. When Henderson Martin resigned as cnairman or the utilities commission this week, an effort was made to pro vide a better berth for Seaton. But Judge Helm refused to rive un his rate clerk-attorneyship Job at 16.000 a year ana accept Martin's Job at 84.000 a year. That change would have made a place zor seaton. ut now, it Is claimed, a 92,600 attorneyship to the utilities com mission has been provided and that means an increase of $700 a year in the salary wnicn seaton is drawing. For some months the Hodges press agent has been an attorney for the commis sion, but he has drawn only, his regu lar salary as pardon and parole clerk. In event Seaton goes to the utilities commission. Senator J. W. Howe of Abilene would probably land Beaton's Job. At present Howe is secretary to the board of control. During the 1912 primary campaign, Howe looked after the Hodges publicity department and come months ago was slated for up nolntment m minnrintpnlBnf n tho Hutchinson reformatory. Pearl In Optimistic -When the final reorganization of po litical parties in Kansas is brought about, hundreds of Progressives will go to the Democratic party rather than re turn to the Republican party, according to F. M. Pearl of Hiawatha. - "The Progressives are generally well pleased with the progressive admmis- - tration of President Wilson," said Pearl in discussing political conditions with some state house friends, "and when the reorganisation comes, you ' will find hundreds of Kansas Progres sives going into the Democratic party rather than back to the Republican party. These Progressives have faith In the Wilson administration and will vote with the Democrats in the hope - that they can put across the progres sive program which has already been launched. In my opinion the Demo cratic party in Kansas will next year poll as many votes as both the Repub lican ana progressive parties." -Banm Is Knergctlc : " Ellsworth county has a candidate vm I tniTA HTfliM mnnnaj.

The Fourth district Republicans will harmonise right in William Al len White's :-- home town. Emporia: Their meeting will, be held Thursday, Dec 19, and It is probable that ev ery county in the district will be rep resented at the conference. This is the second district harmoi.y meeting to be held in Ksnsss, The First district meting in Atchison last week was a big success and has given the cause a boost in other seconds of the state. Fifth district Republicans have called a conference for Jan. at Manhattan and meetings will be held this winter In the Second, Third. Seventh and Eighth districts. The Sixth district Is the only one which Is dragging. But Republicans In that section of the state declare that they will make a good showing In the next election without a harmony conference. A News Service Change. Paul Adams, one of the well known Topeka newspaper . correspondents, has retired from the Kansas News Service, a local newspaper syndicate. Adams furnished a large amount of the Topeka news furnished Kansas dailies and had for several years been on the staff of local papers. He haa sold his interest In the syndicate to C. A. Sloan, with whom' he had been associated for several months.

The radicals ruled the Republican state conference and forced the approval of a direct state-wide primary law. State Chairman William Harnes s notion to reaffirm the more conservative orlmarr slank In th. lut Republican platform was defeated by a VI HQ W) 101. The radicals, led by Henry L. Stimson, former secretary of war. anlit with Mr. Barnes and his followers over the ques tion of retaining party conventions. The state chairman's proposition wag that the conference favor the direct nomination of congressmen, members of the state legis lature, county and municipal officers, but keep the state convention for the nomina tion of governor and the other officers on the state ticket. Delegates to this con vention were to be chosen directly by the voters, who should have the right also to express direct preference for nominations for state officers If they so desired. This did not eult Mr. Stimson and Ms friends end after a long debate they car ried a small majority of the conferees with them. The resolution adopted declared that all candidates should stand on an equal foot ing. It opposed the use of party emblems on the general election ballot and the fac tional column on the primary ballot. At the same time it expressed belief In party organisation and reiterated the doctrine of former Governor Hughes that the di rect primary should be an adjunct to and a check upon, rather than substitute for the deliberation and conference of the party's representatives. auo conference was caiiea to recom mend legislation to the Republican mem bers of the state assembly, wheh was re turned to Republican control in the last election. Nearly every Republican of importance In the state was present. United States Senator Root presided and Mr. Stimson, fnrmer - Attornev General George W. Wickersham, Job E. Hedges, defeated candidate for governor at the last state election, and Seth Low, former mayor of New Tork, took part In the discussions. Mr. Wickersham sided with Chairman Barnes in the primary reform debate. TTntu h nrlmarlAS auestlon was reach ed the meeting worked rapidly and har moniously. It recommended the adoption of a vigorous compulsory wormnsinen compensation law; reform of the rules of the assembly and the amendment of the state constitution to take all state officers except those of governor and lieutenant governor out of the elective list and em power tne governor w mi worn uj y polntment. Recommendation was made also for reforming the state budget and niacins- the administration of the fiscal affairs oi mv oi-iw stable basis." a day or two after it became ana ana was informed that the matter had been placed In the hands of an attorney and that It would cost him 810 more to nihii tho nuitar out.

Following this decision in Chicago, 8talker filed suit for damages against uraae in toe Wyandotte county courts, and was awarded luderment for 88.000. The supreme court in its decision today reduced the damages to 85.448. Must Pay Attorney Fees. r j. Bland. Charles Dixon and Harry Brown. Cherokee county liquor dealers. must serve jail sentences or seven u eleven months each, pay fines of 8700 to 81,100 each and a large amount of costs according to the opinion of the supreme court today In three consoli dated cases. The three defendants were Jointly tried by W. P. Montgomery of the attorney general's office last Marcn and Bland was convicted of selling li quor on eleven counts and his two co- defendants on seven counts each. This was one of the most import ant convictions in the southern Kansas "bad lands" and established a new record in liquor convictions in that section of the state. At the conclusion of the case Judge E. E. Sapp directed that no attorney. fees should be allow ed, as the statute has required ever since the enactment of the prohibitory law; and upon that feature of the case Sapp was reversed by the supreme court, but the conviction and Jail sen tences imposed were affirmed. This case attracted considerable attention when It was submitted to the supreme court a month ago because Judge Sapp personally ' appeared before the court and argued the case against the con tention of the attorney general's office as to fees. The supreme court In its opinion states that a separate fee should be allowed for each count upon which each defendant was convicted In stead of a single fee from all of the three defendants. The decision means fees amounting to 8625 for the attorney general's office. . Shawnee County Derisions. A number of Shawnee county deci sions were handed down today by the supreme court, but in all of them the suits were of minor importance. Five Shawnee county cases were in the list of today's decisions. The court affirmed the decision of W. W. Harvey vs. L. C. Wesson. In that ease John C. Postlewaite held a Judgment against Willis Edson. Pos tlewaite died In November,. 1810, and Edson died in May. 1911. The ftidar- ment had not been satisfied and the court appointed receivers for both men to protect the Interests of the estates. An appeal was taken from the court's decision, but that decision was today affirmed. . The State Bank of Chautauqua was pernuitea to collect 6S50 on an insur ance policy held on property belong ing to people who had secured a loan at tne name. The Insurance policy was for $750 and when the property was destroyed by fire the Shawnee Fire Insurance company refused to meet tne claim on the bank under provisions of their policies. . The courts, however, held that the bank was an Innocent party and entitled to Judgment. - Mattle Johnson was charged with the sale of liquor on five counts and a nuisance charge was made the sixth count. The Jury found her guilty on the first count but discharged her on the sixth count. The Journal entry, however, showed conviction, fine and sentence unaer the sixth count. It was a clerical error and was correct ed. But the defense objected and ap pealed to the supreme court. The court today said the correction of the Journal entry was within the province ox tne court. Dennis P. Hlnchey ' and William Starrett quarreled over a real estate transaction and their grievances reached the courts on a plea of fraud. Hincney won ana a new trial granted. An appeal was taken and the ruling of the district court affirmed. O. W. -FalL-as clerk, etc.. et al., de fendants; original proceeding In man damus. Dismissed. BY
