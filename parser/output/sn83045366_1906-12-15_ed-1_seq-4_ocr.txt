Pally anrt Sunday, one month.... 40e One Drop of Real Blood. One uiop oi blood wrung from the heart is the cost to the morning paper of its editorial oi today covering the transportation situation northwest. It is.admitted that there is something this matter of carrying economy of rail road operation so far that it affects the country served adversely and be comes a hardship npon the people. For two weeks this has been discussed in business circles from Minneapolis to Minot and from Duluth to Albert Lea. It will be gratifymg to -people interest ed to know that they are -all right, that there is really something to it, for the Tribune says so. There are two ways to run a news paper. One is to print news. Every paper gets beaten at times. No paper can get every new idea first. Some new thought economics is presented. The country takes notice. One paper has perhaps raised the issue. Every decent paper gives it fair considera tion whether it had it first or not. Anothei way is to sit back sullenly wlien beaten out and discredit the idea, refuse to print news beanng upon it, and, when the thing finally becomes a matter of first importance in the public mind, write vicious, malicious articles attacking the character of the publica tion that first raised the question. This latter course was consistently followed by the Tribune. But the thing has gone on and grown. Every business man in the northwest is acquainted with condi tions. No sane man questions the fact that the railroad service has been very inadequate and a majority believe that extreme economy of operation, if not the basic thing, is at least an import ant contributing cause. No paper can ignore such an issue, affecting the gen eral prosperity of the country for ever. News comes at last that has to be printed. And so there must finally be recognition of a situation of gen eral interest and! some half-baked edij torial explanation of the reasons for taking note of it. The failure of the Tribune to see what is one of the most important economic questions that has arisen for years, that originated right here in the northwest, the effects of which were before that paper as they were before every intelligent ^observer, is" the re sult of a combination of an incom petent commercial news department and an editorial department given over to consideration 'of matters of the Caruso stamp. In .such a combination an economic idea has ,little chance of being under stood. Spain's guarantee that her intentions are peaceful is the appointment of Weyler as minister of war. The Party Circle on the Ballots. The Chicago charter convention has stirred up the machine with a pro posed amendment abolishing party cir cles on the municipal ballot. This proposition would make the Chicago local ballot look like the city ballot in Minneapolis, where all the names are printed on a slip of paper with the party designation after each and where the voter must make a cross after every name he wishes to vote. This is quite familiar to us and we should not know what to do with an other kind of ballot, but the resolutions of the political cominittees of Chicago make it plain that this kind of a bal lot "infringes in a radical manner on the rights and freedom of an enormous portion of the population," that it is an unwarrantable move in restraint of the expression of the pttblie will" and a treacherous blow to popular lib- This *fs something frightful to con template.

We have been going on innocently suppos ing that the freest man was the man who went to the polls and, taking into the booth a ballot which contained the names of all candidates, marked those which pleased him and left the others out in the cold. But now it appears that in not having a circle at the head of his ballot in which he could vote "the straight ticket" he has been de prived of some substantial right. What can that right be? Nothing if not the right to remain in ignorance of the names and records of candidates and trust to the party circle. Nothing but the right to mark time for a party rather than to be a free lance for iib erty. It is rather curious to learn that while we think that we have accepted the Australian form of ballot there are only five states in the union which have really adopted it. The others have modified the ballot, some with party circles, some with emblems, some with separate columns for parties, some with all of these devices to help bosses keep control of ignorance. It is to be hoped Chicago will suc ceed in knocking the rim off the circles. Thomas Lowry used to tell a story of a Minneapolis man who always gave three months' notes in December because it made spring come sooner.

Moral Cowardice in the House all theris|J^e?'^f'^orkiiig their '^W^^^j^f^^^^lfi' t$teiMB sweet will with us lor years and' we ate there might'be ereatea an impres- The hesitation -of congress about raising salaries is'due no doubt to the unpopularity of salary grabs in the past. But the timidity of this con gress is about as cowardly as the bold ness of its predecessors. They took ad vantage of the fact that they had a large majority and rushed thru a bill giving them an immediate raise. The present house* has backed awav from a proposition to raise the salaries of members of the next congress. It gave its adherence to the justice of a* raise by voting substantial increases to the speaker, vice president and members of the cabinet, but when it came to a roll call on the salaries of members all the bravery fled from the house. Its cour age, like that of Bob Acres, oozed out and it would not even stand eidewise to be shot at by the country. This appears to be a mistake. There is substantial reason why congressional salaries should be raised. If the mem bers are to be paid at all they should be paid the value of their time. But as the value of the time of different mem bers is not the same the basis of pay ment should be the minimum wage at which the member can maintain him self honestly in Washington. This can take no account nor make any provis ion for social entertaining, for that is too indeterminate as well as too remote from the actual needs of the government. What is the minimum sum'on which a member of congress can live in Washington plainly, but com fortably, can be ascertained. It has already been ascertained that* $5,000 dees not cover,it. -It was therefore the duty of the house to fix another amount, which would answer. In neglecting to do so the house has shown real moral cowardice. It is regrettable that the best mem bers of the house, who are conscious of the rectitude of their intentions in voting their successors an increase of say, have their votes overwhelmed by the political cowards. Mr. Bryan is of the opinion that the president's message is good and would have been better if he had taken more of the democratic platform. South Carolina's Opportunity. The Charleston News and Courier sadly admits regarding Tillman: "He is doing nobody any good. He is sim ply exposing the state which has, hon ored him with its highest offices to the distrust of the world and, worst of all, he is regarded as typical of the people of South Carolina.*' The News and Courier evidently would, be glad to have the world draw a dif ferent conclusion, one sweeter to South Carolina.' Yet it offers no basis for an. opinion that Tillman is not typical. He has been honored with the highest offices in the state, which Is pretty fair evidence that he was typical of the state at the" time* he was"* elected. He is continued in office, which is some proof that jfcl# type Jfcot changed.

What some people call Mr. Hill's defi ance to the attorney general is not so very defiant after all. It Is only what Mr. Hill would be expected to say for reassuring his stockholders and quiet ing the stock market gamblers. Mr. Hill says the $00,000,000 of new stock will be Issued, but, he does not say It will be done regardless of the state au thorities. He is careful to explain that the Issue is not to be made till May, 1908, and that "before then there will be time for everybody to be satisfied." In other words, he is certain that the Min nesota commission can be convinced that the new issue is bona fide and made for laudable purposes. That is what we all want to know.

GOALS FROM THE FIELD The Curb club was discussing the career of two former member of the legislature, a senator 4fid a member of the house. The senator was one of the combine and It was currently reported that he deliv ered the vote of the house member regu larly and pocketed the compensation, giving the house member only an occa sional lunch. At a dinner where some solons were talking rather freely this particular sen ator was criticised rather freely, when the house member above mentioned be came warmly indignant. "I can't stand for such criticisms of Senator Blank," he said. "Blank is a friend of mine, the fact is, he is the man who brought me out." "Well, I guess," drawled another house member "the fact is too that he has cashed you in as often as he brought you out." "J After listening to "Vogner" by the Symphony orchestra one is forced to con clude that the German wild man has had some wrong from the* brass bands.

Wagner i"did not write his pieces for brass bands' any more than Shakspere wrote his for parlor theatricals, So it is unfair to'charge him with all the crimes the summer bands have committed in his name. ""Vogner" as inteypreted by the orchestra is eminently safe and sane, one whom children might stroke without arousing violent passions.

MAKERS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE would be a good general title for the three books of literary criticism and his tory from the pen of W. J. Dawson. Tnese books bear, respectively the titles Makers of English Prose, Makers of Eng lish Poetry, and Makers of English Fic tion. The last named received notice in this department several months ago. New editions of the first two, having recently been received, deserve special mention now. It is perfectly safe to say that no books of like kind are more thoroly readable than these. There is-'one quality above all others that commends them. This is the directness with which the author goes to the heart of his subject or sub jects Having entered upon a chapter dealing with a writer, he wastes no un necessary time with trivial details, but goes at once to the content of the au thor's work, to the questions of the Work's significance, and of its title to the position it holds in literature. The life of the man, the' influences it has been subjected to, the fruit it has borne these atfe the things Mr. Dawson deals with, and not the color a writer's house was painted, nor the phases of the moon In which he began his works. This rectness of approach is paralleled by a directness and beautiful lucidity and ac curacy expression. One might almost say that he himself belonged among the makers of English prose, even by his own testthe enlargement of the possi bilities of art by the opulence of his gifttho he would the last to make such a claim. Besides, or what per haps should have heen mentioned first, he has been a patient and thoro reader and is an efficient and thoughtful critic.

CONGRESSMEN HAD FUN IN SPELLING DEBATE Joihers on Both Side* of the House When Mu,c-Moote All Dems Break Loose. Question Is Brought to ForeDemocrats Manned Big Batteries and Majority Members Let Them Go On. Washington, Dee. 14.The intense love and affection of the people on Capitol hill for President Roosevelt, was well illustrated when the question of adopting the president's simplified spellling came up in the house. The legislative appropriation bill was under consideration, and in it was a provision that the public printer spell according to Webster, or some other standard dictionary, when he prints the public documents. This amounted to an order that the president's instruc tions to use the simplified form be ig nored, but it was new legislation ana could only remain in an appropriation bill by unanimous consent. That is any gentleman could come to* the presi dent *s rescue and throw out the spell ing paragraph by the simple expedient of raising a point of order against it, yet, while some of the members claimed to stand for the proposed reform, none raised his voice to save the president from the rebuke which he would re ceive if the paragraph were to he left in and become law. Indeed many members did not hesi tate to use the opportunity to air their feelings by trying to make the presi dent's spelling order look ridiculous. Thus Champ Clark of Missouri inter rupted Mr. Oillett of Massachusetts, who was standing up in a somewhat feeble and half-hearted way for the president, and asked Gillett this ques tion: 400 Tears, He Says. "Has the gentleman calculated how long it would take to modify the Eng lish language at the rate of" 300 words a year?" I have not," replied Mr. Gillett. "It would take 400 years," said Mr. Clark. "Now, if you are going into this remodeling business, why not go the whole hog and take the phonetic system of spelling that has forty-four letters in it, and that absolutely abol ishes the task or stunt of learning to spell at allf If you take the forty four letters you will have every sound included in the language. If vou adopt the shorthand system of writingand you can learn that as well as you can the system we now writeyou will save from three to five year's in the life of every citizen of the republic in getting an education. As to this order the president, it is* absolutely pitia ble. It produces confusion without do ing any good. It simply muddles things. I am willing to go the whole hog on spelling reform, but I am not willing to take 300 words out of 120,000 and pester ourselves and everybody else for 400 years in completing the reform." had been placed in It all much as if the i Plookerda Pvery ara the bill by the republican members for the purpose of letting the democratic members have fun with the president and certainly they took advantage of it, even to Leader Williams, while th3 majority members sat back and^ An noyed themselves. The only republican to take any particular part in making it unpleasant for the president was Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania$ and all 'he Old was to furnish material" for the democrats by giving the house an exact transcription of the investigation made by the committee on appropriations into the spelling reform order. Here is a piece of the stenographic report of the hearing before the committee cited by Mr. Bingham: Mr. TawneyWas there any refer ence, in the president's order directing this simplified form of spelling, to a board on simplified spelling? Mr. Stillings (the public printer)I was referred to the report of a board on simplified spelling. Mr. TawneyIn looking over the names of the men constituting this board I find that of -Isaac K. Funk, editor and publisher of the Standard dictionary. In the event that congress adopted the simplified spelling by hav ing congressional documents and laws printed in accordance with the report of this board, would it be necessary to get out a new dictionary? Mr. StillingsI think it would, ulti mately yes, sir. New School Books, Too. Mr. TawneyI also notice the names of Benjamin E. Smith, editor of the Century dictionary, and Henry Holt, a publisher of New York. Is that a schoolbook publishing house? Mr, StillingsI understand it to be. MetropolitanFirst Half Week* Tomorrow night the Metropolitan will offer its patrons the comic opera "Sergeant Kitty," with Helen Byron as the star. Of the opera it ^$an be said that it was played with success for 150 nights at the Casino, New York, since which time it has been seen in almost all the principal cities of the country. It is a comic opera in every sense of the word, as it has a well defined plot and' the book was written for the sole purpose of engendering good, whole some mirth. miss Byron is a petite and winning little person, vivacious and clever, and always enrapport with her audience. James McElhern and Tom Hadaway are the comedians. A comely chorus is promised and costumes that will prove most effective in rounding out the many good points of the opera.

Aside from the fact that "The Dis trict Leader," due at the Metropolitan Dec. 20, is equipped with a bright, snappy chorus, is mounted in a $50^000 scenic setting and costuming it has the heart interest that appeals to patriotic and fun-loving Americans. The story deals with politics, love and sunshine. Joseph E. Howard, the author of the play will appear in the cast, playing the title role of "The District Leader." Bijou' A Race for Life," a play in four acts, will be the attraction at the Bijou next week, beginning with the Sunday matinee. i.\ Lyceum Beginning Monday evening, the Frawleys will present a double bill at the Lyceum, "The Littlest Girl" Mr. TawneyThe adoption by con gress of this form of spelling would ultimately, and in the very near future, no doubt: necessitate the publication or a new dictionary and new schoolbooks and their purchase by the citizens of the United States? Mr. StillingsThat would probably be the result. And having laid this ammunition be fore the house, Mr. Bingham sat back with the rest of the committee on ap propriations and enjoyed the spectacle provided by the democrats as they tore the president to pieces. The only re publicans to speak for Mr. Roosevelt were Messrs. Gillett of Massachusetts and Mr. Norris of Nebraska, and they were not stalwart about it. Mr. Gillett said the president was entitled to send in his message in Greek, if he wanted to, and Mr. Norris held that the pub lic printer was bound to print every thing from any department of the gov ernment as the manuscript was pre pared, and to follow the copy, no mat ter how it was spelled. 

WHAT TO SEE AT THE THEATERS NEXT WEEK 1 and "Lost Twenty-four Hours." "The Littlest Girl" is a-dramatis ation of one of the series of Van'Bib ber's stories by Richard Harding Davis, and the scene of the'one act is laid in the apartments of a~ wealthy .New Yorker, Mr. Caraffaer. Blinded and braised by the Infidelity o nis di vorced wife, and believing 'that* -fSi* Might Use Moro. "But," said Mr. Gaines of Tennes see, "he might sent in his message in Moro, or Tagalog, or Filipino, or Ger man. "Certainly I think that is entirely within his discretion," replied Mr. Gil lett. with a grin. I would fike to ask the gentleman (Gillett) if he is a member of this amalgamated association for simplified spelling?" inquired Mr. Landis of In diana, chairman of the committee on printing, amid much laughter, as it was thereby revealed that the president did not consult the committee on printing when he issued his spelling reform or der. "No, I am not," said Gillett, at which there was another roar, as tho Gillett had said something very funny, in thus possiblv acknowledging that he was standing for the simplified spelling for no other reason than that the pres ident was for it. Where the Printer Stood. "If we do not enact any legisla- tion," said Chairman Tawney of the appropriations committee, "the public printer may make documents conform to the executive standard 'he may use the executive standard for printing some classes of documents and some other standard in relation to others." "We understand," interposed Mr. Clayton of Georgia, "that there is no law compelling the public printer to spell in any particular way, no positive law, no legislative enactment "but does not the executive order of the presi dent, whose appointee he is, bind him to ,the extent that the president may re move him if he does not conform to his directions? Would not he do it, know ing the president as you know him, and that when he says a thing he general ly has some meaning to it? Do you not think he would discharge the public printer if he did not conform to his directions?" I think his recommendation to the public printer is very apt to receive the public printer's careful considera- tion," admitted Mr, Gillett, dryly. "*"*The public printer-'is A wise man and onto his nob,'' commented Clayton. Keifer Good "Chaser." Then John Sharp Williams, the denv ocratic leader, took a hand. "Take the word 'thru," he said: "that might spell 'through' in German, it might spell 'through' in half a dozen languages, but the English 'u' is never pronounced 'oo' and vou can not make 'throo' out of it. In New England there is a disposition to make 'oo' sound out of 'u'the old English 'u.' In other-part's nounced The fun wasigoing along in fine fash ion when J.

In "Lost Twenty-four Hours" Mrs. Dick Swift returns to her home after a week's absencfe, and entering her husband's smoking room finds him en during the unwelcome embraces of the beautiful Bertha Darce, an attachment of his bachelor days, and a woman without social recognition. Innocently accepting Dick's explanation, that Bertha is his sister, the hospitable lit tle bride gives the woman a hearty welcome, and invites her to make her home with them." Previous to this, Dick, taking ad vantage of his wife's visit to her par ents, spends a night witjh his bachelor friends, which affected him so peculi arly, that for thirty hours he lay in a slumber from which he was aroused by the breaking in of his bedroom door, at the instigation of his brother David, a member of the household, an austere theological student. Thinking he -has slept only a short time, Dick loses twenty-four hours, which causes the serious complications that tax all his ingenuity and diplomacy to disen tangle.

AMUSEMENTS 0 5 The SympKbny OrchestraBurgstaller. Alois Burgstaller, well remembered Minneapolis as the magnificent Parsifal of the Damrosch organization, came down from the grand opera pedestal last even ing and renewed hijs appeal to local mu sic lovers from the concert platform As the soloist at the symphony concert at the Auditorium he was one of the mu sical triumphs of the season Few sing ers have received as hearty and sincere appreciation here. This was due in no small part to his generosity. After singing three Wagner selections, the prize song from the Meistersmger, the narrative of Lohengrin, and Siegmund's love song from "Die Walkure," Herrr Burgstaller yielded to the plea of Director Oberhoffer and the insistent applause of the people, and gave an extra number. It consisted of "Der Neugerige," by Schubert, and the "Wanderlied" of Schumann, Mr Ober hoffer supplying piano accompaniment. After a long evening of solid Wagner, delightful as it had been, the breath of other lyrics was refreshing, and this number had the heartiest applause of all. It won for an encore SchuDerfs "Unge- duld," and when Burgstaller came on for this last favor, his greeting was thun derous. The big tenor fairly won the hearts of the musical public of Minne apolis Tho not always smoothly han dled, his voice Is a marvelous thing, lJure and sweet in its upper tones, big and organ-like as it descends. His boy ish spirit and his awkwardness only add to the appeal he makes. The Minneapolis Symphony orchestra was not overshadowed In. any degree by the soloist. Its work has never^ per haps, been more spontaneous and mu sicianly The program was admirably selected to give Variety in themes and tone coloring, and to present Wagner all his moods and tenses. Three grand opera preludes, familiar to all Wagner lovers, were interspersed durmg the evening, and all were given in a man ner entirely satisfactory. The rich har monies and reposeful qualities of the Siegfried Idyl gave a more intense pleasurg, and the high- point of the evening was no doubt reached in the playing of the "Good Friday Spell" from "Parsifal," a tone poem that lends it self to reading even when removed from Its inspiring setting This was given w4th the most artistic shading and phras ing. The fitting climax to all was the "Ride of the Valkyries," which the or chestra gave with a splendid enthusi asm, and lifted the audience to such a pitch of enthusiasm that the number had to be repeated. The big orchestra is now well launched on its season, and the work of last night is ample evidence that it is climbing to greater perfection of artistry.
