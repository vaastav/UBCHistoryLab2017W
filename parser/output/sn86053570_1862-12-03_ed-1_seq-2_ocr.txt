D. C.l DEC. 3, 1803, TltS MEilAOE. Tha part cf the President's oeatagt which U devoted to the emancipation question Is the ctdyftatura which Is llkelr to elicit onch an ration. The orlglnalitr of Mr. Lincoln'! propos ltlons and arguintLtt cannot faUtottrUcttheccuntrx, and the world, and tnnst, therefore, call ont a pretty broad and fall dltcnstlon of the alertly question. He propoaea tome alterations lu the Contl tntlon, which, of themaelres, will be considered gTaro matter! of great public Interest. The chief feature of this proposed alteration upon which we shall sow comment, is the time allow ed to the States In which to put an end to slavery. The proportion does sot meet otutkjevs, for aa the loyal slaveholders are to be compensated for their ham a n chattels, It strikes ns that free dom should' be more speedily conferred upon the bondman. He la entitled to his liberty to day, aa much aa his children will be thlrtT-eeren yesra hence We can readily nnderatand, how ever, the President's purpose. It Is to find some common ground upon which there may be agreement of all parties, and of men of every (bade of opinion, In effecting this work. The President evidently wishes to bring the border State people to adopt an emancipation policy which aball look to the ultimate extlnc Hon of slavery. Mr. Lincoln would, If we un derstand him, lead the people of these States to do something to save themselves from loss be fore It shall be too latei hence he proposes thst Congress and the loyal States shall tender to them, through the forms of constitutional amendment, a motive for action. Viewing the President's proposition in this light, we csn resdlly appreciate his views as well as the pa trlotlim which Inspired them. There Is another view of this perplexing ques Hon which rosy have Influenced the President in offering these opinions, and arguments to the country The South entertain the notion very generally that the North baa so right to enter fere In any way with their "peculiar lnatltu tion i" that Northern opinions and principles are ail wrong upon the subject of slsvcry. They do not therefore care to move even when it Is proposed to pay them for their slaves, lest it might seem like yielding to Yankee pressure and Yankee opinion We find this to be the tick with many slaveholders with nhom we have conversed. Mr. Lincoln would obviate this by so altering the Constitution that It shall be deemed a matter of sacred compact, and the whole country pledge Itself thus to carry out In good faith each particular act In thegreatwork cf emancipation. The President's argument, from his premises, .s sound and able, and, as we have said else where, will mske sn lmpresslou upon the coun t The thtnv-teven years the time fixed bv the President as the limit of slavery will proba bly sever be adopted, and If It were adopted In fcrm, slavery would come to an end long be frrelWO. The English Government tried the appren ticeship ejtteta In their colonies, bnt the plant ers rejected It, and took Immediate emancipa tion, and hence 600,000 human beings went free in a tingle day So It will be In this coun trr long before 1900. Nevertheless, llr. Lln eds's proposition is a definite one, and con trary cpinlons may harmonize upon eome middle ground. We are In favor of compenaated emanclpa Hon, and we are so because we believe that the perpetuity of this country under one govern ment Is as Impossibility while slavery exists) moreover, we are so because we believe thst the :orth should bear Its part of the expense In getting rid of slavery. The North has shared in the profits of slavery, If, Indeed, there have bees anv profits. At any rate, It Is no more than Just that the North ehoold tax Itself to get rid cf alavery and of all lta concomitant erlK What la money compared to freedom t We can say frankly that we like the message, without pretending to agree with every view therein presented. It bears upon its every page, not only marks of ability and honesty, but of true statesman ship, and we cordially commend It to the coun try, hoping that it will tend greatly to trinrinl Hie our distracted country, and lead to the con summation of those grand results which we have no doubt our patriotic President desires so devoutly.

SOLDIXE MiKRIID. Lieut. Wm. H Powell, Adjutant of the Fourth Infan try, and A. A. A, General of the First Brigade cf Saxea'Dlvlelon.of this city, led to the by menial altar yesterday morning, the fair Miss Etchison, also of thfs city The Rev. J. C. Smith officiated. Lieut. Powell Is an old Washington typo, and In the recent battles In which he hss been en gsged, both on the Peninsula asd In Maryland, hat displayed nsssusl courage and efficiency There will be no public receptions at the White House this winter, owing to the recent WAnHIKOTOS, TTZDNESDAT, - death of Willis Lincoln. s I' A DEOUm BATTIJC Those who express an Impatient desire for a decisive battle between Gen. Burnelde and Gen. Lee, do so, In many caaea, without reflecting upon the meaning of the words they use. A de cisive battle Is a very serious , thing, asd does -. - . .v-fc.i..l r .... T y' i. agi occur OUCH in sue uisiury vifw.r.. a. altogether clear that It Is for the interest of the national cause to put lta fata upon the haiard of a single throw of the die anywhere 1 If such extreme counsels can be listened to upon either tide, Is It not to the rebels that they commend themselves most plausibly t Is It not they, rather than ua, who are forced to take the laat chance of the ruined and desperate gamester! A battle may be called decisive, which results In the substantial ruin of one of the armies en gaged, or because the event of It determines the Issue of a campaign, as where the defeated party can raise no second army, or where sne cesa gives to the victor some dominating po sition. It Is an approved military maxim, never to offer, or voluntarily accept battle, with any thing like equal chances, where the conse quences of defeat would be more dlaaatrous than the couaequences of victory would be like ly to be advantageous. It will hardly be said that the loss of Rich mond would be so great a blow to the rebellion, as the loss of Washington would be to the na tional Government, or that a pitched battle In which we should wager Washington against Richmond, would not be giving to the enemy tremendous odds In the stakes. And no battle betn een Gen. Bnrnslde and Gen. Lee can be called decisive, except one fought upon a scale and under circumstances to determine which party shall have both capitals. The rebels can lose Rlchmondwlthout losing Virginia, and they can lose Virginia without losing their cause. It Is known that they were on the point of abandoning Richmond last summer, If, unexpectedly to them, onr army had not been so delayed In the horrible awamps of the Chlckahomlny and thereby so reduced and ao enfeebled, that they concluded to take the chances of aesalUng It Is the field. If Rich mond Is lost, they can still make another stand at Lynchburg, and If Virginia Itself Is lost, they still hare ample regions at the South within which to retire. We hare too mnch confidence in the wisdom of our military management to apprehend that any unequal or dlsproportloned risks will be voluntarily tsken. The public sentiment de mands fighting, but It does not demand that the fate of a cause, which now has all apparent prospects In Its favor, shall be cast upon any thing so uncertain In its own nature as a single bsttle. That la the policy of despair, not of reasonably assured success. It Is only after a further development of our military operations Is the West and Southwest thst the Importance of a great battle between Gen. Bnrnslde and Gen. Lee can be equal to both parties. With East Tennessee In our possession, the Mississippi opened, Texas cut off from the Confederate empire, and the States of Louisiana and Mississippi thoroughly sub dued, the rebel csuse would be wholly over thrown'by the defeat of Gen. Lee's army, then limited to a single and assailable line of retreat, and with lta basla for possible recuperation re duced to lnslgnlficent boundarlea. EDITORIAL SUMMARY.

Whereabouts of Little Crow Hla Band Preparing for a Vigorous Attack. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs has had laid before him by Senator Rice a letter from an Intelligent correspondent, dated St. Panl, Nov. 23, giving the whereabouts and Intentions of that daring and dangerous chief, "Little Crow," and urging the propriety of a winter campaign for the purpose of driving him from his position. He was discovered by this correspondent's party encamped with about 1,900 Sioux war riors near Devil's Lake, situated about 80 miles from St. Joseph and about 200 miles from Aber cromble. A council was held, and among other things revealed by "Little Crow," was the fact that expecting t6 have about 3,500 men by the spring, through acquisitions from. the Gro Ventus and Missouri Indians, he Intended a vigorous at tack at that time. The writer tayt that Devll't Lake Is a most advantageous position and a great stronghold for defence, and unless "Little Crow" be dislodged before spring, he will be able to arrange a campaign In comparison with which onr Indian war thus far haa been mere chlld'a play. Senator Rice endoraes the vlewa of the writer with regard to a vigorous winter campaign, as does also Commissioner Dole. Personal. Hon. Geo. S. Cobb and Hon. N. Perrey, N. J. Hon. J. W.

An overwhelming victory on the part of Lee and the defence or Washington would be gone and the city may be captured.
