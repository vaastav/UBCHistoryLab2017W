In thorns porrei of Amoricaii llintory whereon are Uvonured the incmorahlo tlucdi of hcrotam and bravery, performed by the fenrlcaa bark wood farmers and veteran liuntcn In llio day a of 1776, are recorded utatiy inatancea of jioraonul bra. very and patient endurance. Wonderful eajacity and conaccrnate ouorsY fiitorod into the cltaracteri of our anccaton while they were buttlinc not only with the Britiuli, but also with the wild and rutltlena aaviire from the for eat, rendered the situation of the atrujr gling colonists extremely perilous. Ma ny brave settlers from personal animosity "nil hatred of the savage alone, left the log- cublna and took to tho wilderness to mako war upou them. It is not surpris ing then thut so many not olives of the prowess aud skill of tlicso men, are marie innUers ol history. The fenU of Lewis Wvtzt'll, in his encounters with the red men of America, are resd with interest. His name is familiar In every household and frequently figure In the blood and tltuuder roniNiiccs of the day, w hero, .un fortunately, his exploits are unlilusliiiiyly eiarrererauda These war-like stories, however, must, now in a measure, give place to the cx citinj Incidents ef the present unholy warfare war with all its horrible attend ants, has lifted hia unseemly front ia the beautiful land of Columbia, a'ud now the people of the extremes of our country are bitterly hostile to each oilier, and fu.hers stand., guarded with- the bright bajrouct, against aons. Brothers, forgetting- in tha engendered feelings of base politicians, the nobler sentiments of love and brotherly regard, slnnd rui.ipaut for bloodshed aud war. Before this unwarranted crusade of einhiliuus traitors, sgaius, a good geveru. mont, many brave men who fi'lit for country, and many who fiht hUndly du ceived by the illusory mirage, raised by enprinciph'd leiders, wll wet the soil with their blood. Widow's tears will nourish the glurioux treo of libjrty, ami 'ner ibi dituiug vi'or axilil it sprt ucs again jU protecting UraliclKn, and tontiii-1 ues tu Iki thufvluge vl tin; p-'fducuk'd ol tha world.

Traitors will live in memory onlv, there tube stigmatised, The wheels a.fliovernineiit w ill he cleans- sd of lrsitir.n muck. TI.ev will he m.- ; ialied with truo patriotism and oiled with j official hem at)-. How beautifully tliey w ill run! Thc hilly and miuintnlnous character of Western Virginia, determines in s great degree, the mode ofwarlaro tn be adopt- eil. There are inonntnin fastnesses that furnish, abundant cover for treason's fol- lowers, from whenco they can sally w hen they list to pilleage and muriiuder, and yet defy apprehension. Already this un- i derbrush warfare hns been practiced by the rebels. Jt is congenial to them, and not a few pinca on Cheat Mountain and in tho vicinity of Moloney, are silent witnesses vf the deeds of the Bushwhack ore. But it is not the purpose In this little sketch to relate rebel exploits, but rather to narrate rebol discomfitures. 1'roniincnt among the individuals, we think, who will in a future history of the present rebellion take equal rank with Welzell, Wryneck, Too and Brady of Sun flitch proclivities, will figure the name of Moses Holierts.or Mose Robrrts for alio ri. Thie personngo, our hero, at present labors for the Union in the hss- ardius capacity of spy or scout. Ho a square built muscular ninn, strong and active, and eminently fitted for his cho sen duly. In hight he measures, by the tape line, five feet six inches. Like all of his ilk ho makes use of various dis guises and charucters, to conceal his real intent and achievo his ends. If sny one should bo suddenly renfron led In the woods on the highway, or among swamp dcerrushes, by s little old man, with a crooked walking stick, an old felt bat, hobnailed shoes and moving along as ifin extreme agony, from rheu matic twinges, with a woe-begnne face. shrouded by venerable hair, that old fol. low might be old father Haley or if miyhtbt Mose Roberts. Should a horde of gsllus seresh cavalry sweep down some stony pike, making hrso hair di rectly and gravel indirectly fly, hurrah ing and crying out for Jeff. Daviy, South ern rights sni1 the Confederate Slates, the foremost in the van might be some blood-, fire-enter or it might be Mose Roh rts obtaining leadership under fnlre p donees. But if any ono is fortunate) enough to see a man square bui't and muscular, with dark blue eyes lighting up with kccnvlg ilnnc and a j'lly good-humored counte nance, pregnant with laugh beneath a broad brimmed hat, carl ine in hand and mounted on a little black pony, with a mild face, sharp cars and a devilish twin, klo in his eyes, that Individual ought to be Muse Roberts, the Union Scout, in propria ptrtona. This man, at tho emi nent risk of his life, has born of manifest service to the fcderul army of tha I'oto nine. His knowledge of the roads and paths, tumbles him to lead tho army by the nearest routes to localities where the rebels harbor, and thus tako at a disad vantage the unsuspecting foe, Having introduced our hero, we will now rvlato a story of his prowess. Night has spread her dork apron over old mother earth's bosom, and a drizzling rain was detcending luzily but continu ously through it upou her, and upon the wlnto tents of a fodrral encampment in the imine l ate vicinity of tho town of llomney.Vs. All was silence about the encampment snd nothing of life was to be seen save the lonely sertiuels, slowly moving along their slippery heats. Presently, as James persistently has it, "a solitury horsoman might have been socn," silently emerging from tho camp, and taking the piko leading to whnt is known as the Hanging Rucks a plucc where art, in a strugglo with nature, has gained a vic.tu.-y in the shape of a road way through a nondescript pile uf earth and rocks proceeded down the road at a brisk pace. Arriving at tha gap the horseman, in whom the acute reudor hns probably rec ognized the Hcout above described, pass ed through and continues on his way un molested, until he hud gained s 'distance of five miles beyond. Suddenly his med itations were broken In upon by a rust ling noise among the twigs and wet leaves st the road side, a few paces in advance, Instantly the warry Hcout wus motion, loss. His horse well knowing his mas. tors wish, stood like a ststuo in his tracks. Darkness prevented Moss from discerning anything, and the pattering rain drops rendered his efforts at hearing, equally (utile. After a few moments, employed In an inspection of Lis surroundings, the Scout silently dismounted and leaving his horse standing, untied, in the road, cau tiously advanced toward tbe spot whei.ee tbe noise pame, and keepings sharp look out for concealed foes. Tho spot reach ed, nothing wna ytsiblc, nothing sni;) anything, nothing was there, Vh1lo musing on the siueular circumstances, s voice, apparently t lilt lo way in the wood exclaimed Interrogatively. "Sirl" Il was certainly the ro'ee of a female and iimtaiitly Muse's apprelu Usions of Uie bushw hackers vauii.hud. "Mietjke," suid he, "not my unmu iiiu'am, 1 a.uvvur lo Mmco. Thet ' wns a movemrnt In the liihe :"Pni. and then the same voice, sounding nrafer, said: "r-tr, I know not wluther I am addrea- sing a frietid or a fopj but sttroly yon ore man, and thcrolVire, I ak your protcc nivcrxary ition." "Which t never yel refused a woman," said !' heartily, for somehow ! voice se. pleading ami timid 'ai tone, went way down Into tho heart uf Mose and inado ,im feel ready tiwbrnve the bullets of a Regiment, In it a owners defence. A yonna girl now stepped from the wwla into the l( -d, mid limidly ailvnnr oil toward our hero, who, never ofl'of his ginird, held a revolver in the direction, It was loo dark to see the sweet plend- er for protection, and as It is necessary to 'give a d'scriptioii of her t lia. nis, we will take a romancers spcr.tnc let and by their potent nid, present her to the reader.

This beinir true in respect to Independent nations at war with each otlier, it follows that rebels who are laboring by forcoof arms to over throw s Government justly brlnir upon themselves sll the consequences of war, and provoke tlio destruction merited by the worst of crimes.

The following ia the ps-t of ti e Message in relation to the (Supreme Court and law niulUra w hich we were compelled, fur want of space, to omit last week; There are thron vacancies on the bench of iho rhiprenio Court: two bv the tie ceaaeofjustiree Daniel and McLean and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I hsve so far forborne mnk ing nominations to nil these vacancies, for ressons which I will now state: Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the (States now overrun by revolt, ao that successor were appointed In the same localities, they could not serve upon their circuits, and muny of tho most competent men tl.ero prupsbly would not take tho personal lumrd of accepting. to serve even here upon tho Hunri me boot h. havo been unwilling to throw all the ap polutmeiils nortliv. ru, thus disabling my' seii irom oonig justice to the HojIIi the return uf peuce; although I may ruin urk that to transfer to the North which h is hereto, ire been in the South, would not with rolereneeto territory and population, bo unjust.

If uniformity was at intended, the system requires that all Htules shall be ai e unm udated with circuit courts, attuuded by Supreme Judges. While in fuct Wisconsin, Miunesoln, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California, aud Oregon, have never had any such courts, nor csn this be well remedied without a chungs of the system. Because tho adding of Justices lo Iho Supreme Court oiiouqh for tho sccomiuodhlion all purls ot the country with courts, would croste a court altogether too dungcrous for a judicial body of miy sort md tho will bo one that will Increase States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful or they are nut useful. Il useful, no Slate should be denied them. If nut useful, uo Statu should have them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished as tu all. Three modifications occur to litre, which 1 think would be an improve-' muiit upon our present system. Let Supreme Court be of coiivonient number in evory event, then first: Let tho w hole country be divided into circil of couveui cut biio, the Supreme Judges to seryiMn iiiimhor of them corresponding to their own number, and independent Circuit Ju Ige be provided Cor nil the rest; secondly: The Supreme Judgee bo Irom circuit duties and Circuit Judges provided for all lha circuits; thirdly: Dispense with Circuit Courts leaving the judicisl (uuclious wholly to tho Diutrict Courts land au Supreme Court. 1 respectfully rcooinmund to the con sideration of Congress tho preient cot.di. lion ol the statute laws, with Uie hope thut Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for tho many iuconvonisnces evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in tbe practical administration them.
