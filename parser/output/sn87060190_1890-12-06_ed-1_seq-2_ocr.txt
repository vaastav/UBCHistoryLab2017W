An Albany special to the New York Herald says that Governor Hill has de clared that he will not be a caudidate for the U. S Senate or for re-election as Govprnor, but that he will be a cuididate for the Presidential nomination. Hill is letting Cleveland know in divers ways that if the latter wants the nomination in '92 he will have to fight for it. However, the Democrats of the country will have something to say of this subject. Atkinson, the statistician, says that "one out of every three Americans works lor a livinp, supporting the other two; that is to say, out of fifty millions, sev enteen millions and a-half are actually employed in productive labor. Each person thus occupied for gain turns out about $C00 worth of work per head, 7 per cent, of which is applied in taxation. The taxation, therefore, of the United States represents the annual labor of 1,- 218,000 persons." George Washington, who represents Newport in the Cou. Con. and who is Chairman of the Committee on Elec tions, is making a w.irm fiidit for the adoption of the acctet ballot system. In one part of his speech he said that one man had no more right to intrude him self upon ai.othor and attempt to find out the way he vo'ed than to peep cvt, another man's shoulder nnd attempt to ascertain the contents of a letter. Either of these was wrong, and the height of indecency. The appluuso following this was deafening, says a special, and the p ople of the State will applaud such jsentimentP. .

Let them repeal the MoKlnlby bill. Everything else will take oare of Itself. I don't think any thing about the Elcotlou bill.

Tho Lodge Bill and tho Farmers. Harrison and the other Republican leaders have heard from the thousands of farmers of the country on the infamous Lodge Election bill. The National Farmers' Alliance in pes aon nt Ocala, Fla , has spoken and its words ara not to bo misunderstooJ. Here is its opinion of the measure referred to: Whereas, The .President of tho United Htates, In his annual message to Congress, recommends and urges thelmmedlatepasuige ot the measure known as the Lodge Election bill ; and Wukkeas, Bald bill Involves a radical rev olution In the election machinery of the Union, both State and National, and Its pass age will be Utal to tho autonomy of the States and cherished liberties oi the citizens; and Wueke in, 8ald bill Is parthan In spirit, and will be partisan In Its application, thus revi talizing tho goiy ghost of sectional estrange ment; and Whereas, In the holy war which wo havo declared against sectionalism, the firesides of the farmers of the North, East, South and West are the citadels around which the heav iest battles are being fought; and to the end that victory may crown our crusade, and fra ternity and uuity reign ; therefore, be it Resolved, By the National Farmors' Alli ance nnd Industrial Union ot America, lu National Council assembled, that we do most solemnly protest against the passage of said Lodge Election bill, and most earnestly peti tion our Senators to employ all fair nod legal ru cutis to defeat tills unpatriotic measure, which can result In nothing but evil to one common and beloved country. Jiesolved further, That a copy of these pre ambles and resolutions be forwarded to each Senator In Congress. These resolutions were unanimously adopted. Delegates were present from most every section of the country, and their action clearly shows what the peo ple think of this bill which the Republi cans are trying to force through Congress. They are opposed to it, and have said so, and it now remains to bo seen whether Harrison and his partisan followers will heed the warning. Municipal elect ons at Louisville are held under n ballot law similar to the Australian syttain, and a uentleman who w b present a few daysaco and witnpfased the workings of the law, thus sppaks of it : " It's n good thing.

When on the inside of this enclosure the voter presents his ballot, which somewhat resembles a thea ter coupon ticket, that Is the ballot Is num bered alike at both end. One end of the bal lot Is torn off by tho officer of election, the voter's name Is written on it and then placed on a Me. The other end is then dropped into the box by the voter, and he falls back to make room for the next In line. You sep no erowds stand Around the voting places, as no one Iq allowed to loiter wlthlu loss than fifty feat of tho polls, Ja .chalk mark on the side walk indicating the distance to be kept. Yes, it's n good system and works quietly and well. There were no crowds standing aronnd tho polls, and no nolso or confusion to lndl'cato that an election was held."
