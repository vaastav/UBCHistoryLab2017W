FIRM ON RATE LAW. Corporations, Panama Canal end Many Other Important Topics Are Thor oughly Discussed. ♦ WASHINGTON, 1 >. C , I >ec, Pres ident Roosevelt’s message was read to Congress today. It is in substance us follows: The Nation. The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity. I mloiibtedly there will be ebb and How. Something can be done by legislation to help the general prosperity on a pol ler which shall insure to the advantage of all people w ho act decently. If the lass fortunate matt is moved j to envy to strike at the conditions under , which they both live, the result will he j that while damage may come to th> me struck at, it will visit with nu even bc.iv icr load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we must all go up and down together. Corporations. The corporation lias come to stay just ns tho labor union bus conic to slay. Kach should be favored us long ns it does good. Experience has shown that it is use less to try to get an adequate regulation and supervision ol great corporations by stale action, I believe that it can be ob tained by the'enactment of law by the Congress. If necessary the constitution must he amended. ft ban been a misfortune that national laws on this subns t. have been of a pro hibitive rather than an nllirmafive kind. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another devise. What is needed is not sweeping prohibition but supervision mid regulation. <lf these abuses perhaps the chief is overcapitalization. Railway Rates Law. It must include putting a complete stop our rebates. The power should be alllrnialive and ►honld be given to some administrative body created by the Con gress. The most important provision is conferring on some administrative body the power to decide whether a rate is just • * • if unjust, to prescribe tie* reasonable maximum rate, this to go Into effect within n reasonable time, subject to review by tie courts. A rebated rate should he mad< the maximum on all similar transportation. My proposal is Hot to give the commission power to in itiatc or originate rules, hut to regulate. The I test possible regulation would be an agreement among the railroads to carry out the law. “ * • If would put a stop to discriminations A system of exam ination for railroad accounts similar to that now conducted in national bulks should l‘ pro- i led. I’resent laws have been greatly destroyed by delay In the courts. The question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial success. We must understand that the public servants who are to do this work must he of the highest type. They must be well paid. Safely Appliances. The Congress should provide for the Introduction of block signals on all rail roads engaged in interstate commerce. If tin re are any reasons for laws limit Ing the hoars of labor they certainly np ply to railroad workers with peculiar force. An employees’ liability law applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal government should be enacted. Labor.

The delays of the criminal low, no less than of-the civil, now amount to a very great evil, legislation should be enacted to cover breach of trust in lb<‘ shape of prematurely divulging secrets by an em ploye or officer of the Lulled States. A statute should tie provided for punish ment of a United Slates attorney or oth er officer who corruptly agrees to do wrong, other than for money. Public Land.

U'e cannot afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on pub lic domain. All organized opposition to the forest reserves of the west lias dis nppen red Merchant Marine.

Keep immigrants away from the con gested tenement house districts of tho great cities.. In the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese laborers grave wrong has been done to the people of China. Chine e students, business and profes sional men should he encouraged to come. We cannot expect to receive equity (from China) unless we do equity. Civil Service. Written competitive examinations do not make the ideal method, but they rep resent an iminensurenhly advance upon the "spoils” system. Copyright Laws. Our copyright laws urgently need r vision. Adulteration of Foods. Interstate traffic In foodstuffs which have hern debased or adulterated so aa to injure health or deceive purchasers should he forbidden. National Parks.

Dec. s.—The abolition of the minor state of martial law was ga zetted today and Poland is now com pletely freed from military rule.

The telegraph and postal tieup remained complete. Soldiers' and employes of other departments went being used to deliver portions of the vast accumulation of mail. Defiance from Telegraphers. The telegraph operators met yester day’s threat to discharge them unless they returned to work by resolving to prosecute the strike until their demands are satisfied. The League of Leagues, which is issu ing decrees like a veritable provisional government, openly defied the prefect’s warnings to walking delegates and agi tators that any attempts to persuade em ployes to leave their work would lead to their arrest and the imposition of a fine of .$2OO, and issued a counter proclama tion warning not only the Russian but the Danish operators to work at their peril.
