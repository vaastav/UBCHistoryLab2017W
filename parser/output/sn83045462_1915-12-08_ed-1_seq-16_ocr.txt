CANNOT RELY ON POLITICAL ISOLATION j British Press on "Revelations of German Machinations" Predicts | Vigorous Action by Americans. LONDON. December 8.?-President Wilson's message proves of unusual in terest to the British press, as shown by the editorials in the morning pa pers. In the view of the Daily News, "it is doubtful whether the Monroe doc trine will ever be tenable again, ex- i pericnce having: shown that the United | States can no longer rely 011 political | isolation founded on geographical de- [ taehment. which has largely lost its j meaning.'* 1 The Daily News argues that it is only the British navy which today stands 1 in effective defense of the Monroe doc trine, and that "if Germany were vie- j torious in this war the L'nited States ( guarantees of the independence of the state3 of South America would not he worth the paper on which that doctrine is written." Admits President's Claim. Admitting that President "Wilson's claim that the American policy of neu trality has been of enormous value to the world is justified and in its opera tion had worked to the incalculable advantage of the allies, the News re fers to President Wilson's difflcultics in dealing with the German campaign owing to constitutional restrictions, and shjs: "President Wilson has the courage and executive genius for an emer gency, and we do not doubt that his demand for powers to deal with the situation will be readily granted." The Daily Chronicle says: "After the amazing revelations of German machinations which appear still far from complete, one would be surprised if the United States tolerated the present condition of things much longer. * ? ? It would be strange if the American people did not insist on its government taking strong measures to restore security of life and property 011 American soil and in American ports." Regarded as <4War Message." The Times regards the message as. "by force of events, a war message from beginning to end," and says: "The President has striven and is still striving hard, with the full approba tion of the masses of the people, to cling fast to the notion that the United States can continue to live its own life, uphold exalted ideals throughout the new world and promote their realiza tion in the old world without abandon ing the splendid isolation she has so long enjoyed. The hard realities of the situation created by the war are beginning to show that the notion is no longer tenable with the firm as surance of even last year. "The sudden development of the Boy Ed-von Papen controversy gives the message a dramatic fitness it would not have possessed without this serious complication, and affords a striking in stance of the growing complexity and interdependence of the relations be tween the old world and the new. New Attitude on National Defense. "Even more striking than the Presi dent's denunciation of the German cam paign is the new attitude he assumes on the subject of national defense. It is a sudden break with the past of his own party, and the fact that tlie Presi dent cannot expect his proposals to be carried without hards fighting makes them still more a sign of the times. 1 "The Times believes that although ! the Germans have so often and so | grossly misunderstood the American attitude, they will appreciate the sig nificance of the President's . message, and. with however bad grace, draw back while there is still time."

SESSIONS WILL OPEN WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14 Thirteenth Avoided by Superstitious Ones?Wilson Administration In dorsed by National Committee. J At noon. Wednesday. June 11. the' democratic national convention will J : meet in St. Louis to nominate :i Presi- j I dential ticket and frame a platform for ; the campaign of 1016. This determina- j 1 tion was reached by the democratic j national committee last night after j hearing the claims of Chicago and Dal las boomers in behalf of their respec tive cities. Hondrs were even regarding the money stake and. the trump card in the name was played by Speaker Champ Clark, when in his homely fashion of J talking he told the committee plainly j that if ihe democratic party desired i the eighteen electoral votes of Misson- J ri the committee would do well to | hold the convention in St. Louis. On the first ballot St. Louis showed j twenty-five^ votes, {.-'alias fourteen and . Chicago thirteen. On the second bal- i lot John T. McGraw of West Virginia | changed his vote from Chicago to St. Louis, producing the required majority thereby and the choice was made unan imous. Dodge 13th of Month. The selection of a midweek day for the opening of the convention was i somewhat unusual as conventions usu- i ally meet on Tuesday, but in this case ' Tuesday, would fall on the thirteenth oi J the month, and while President Wilson ! is supposed to regard thirteen as a i lucky number for him. some of the "rabbit-foot-toters" were superstitious. A resolution indorsing the Wilson ad ministration and the democrats of the House and Senate who have helped forward his policies was adopted by a standbier vo;e. The resolution follows: "We congratulate the country on the i splendid administration of Woodrow Wilson. I'nder the most trying ?ir icumstar.ces in our history ho h;is stead fastly worked for the cause of peace, and inns avoided war. without yield ins Ion well recognized principles of inter ! national law. justice and humanity. He ! has vindicated the rights of neutrals on the sea. he has upheld the best tradi j tions of his high office, and has dis j charged his trust with such signal I fidelity, firmness and efficiency. that he I has won the confidence ami affection of i the American people, regardless of po litical affiliations. His masterly han dling of both national and international (questions demands his renominatiou i and re-election as the trusted loader of the national democracy in 11*16. Congressmen Commended. "We heartily commend the efficient service of those distinguished senators land representatives in t'ongress who have tirelessly and successfully endea vored to assist tho I'resident in the work of his administration." The contest from Kentucky was de cided in favor of I "rev Woodson and the Oregon case in favor of Will R. King. The Woodson case was adjudi cated in his favor on the ground that when he was selected by the Kentucky state central committee, it was to fill the entire unexpired term of John C. <*. -Mayo, deceased. The committee found that Gen. Haldeman had contested the seat in entire good "faith by authority of the state convention. U. S. Ccnsul at Canton Stricken. NEW
