The How of Kutern capital which has lwen frightened out of city property, and out of transportation nnd manufacture*, 07 recent event*, into agriculture, in tliu "hape of loans to *mall farmer* ?t the Went, to the preat extent of which we called attention in a recent arliclo on western investment*, is a striking iIIuhtration ol the manner in which,under the ordinary o|ieration of the law* of trade, an? "over doing" in any one field of industry is remedied. That this in a healthy and useful movement, if carried on carefull?, there in no question. It will prove enormous advantage to the Went, and to tlmt invaluable body of men who aim ?} "ecuring farms of their own by |?r istent industry and economy, if conduct* *d,a* we have no doubt it Im for the moat part a-* yet, with care and discrimination. Another proof of the healthiness of (liu movement of capital into agriculture "to be found in the wonderful support ol the nationnl credit mid prosperity which agriculture has supplied since m. With the collapse of the homo de tnanil and the absence o( foreign market* 'or our manufacture*, wo should have been in a sorry plight during the last lour yearn if it were not for the enormous quantity of farm produce we have been abl?* to export; and the probabilities are that, with the steadilv improving means of trangjKjrtation ami increasing skill in preparing products for transportation? of which the cheese and fresh-uient trade *ith Europe are remarkableilluatrations ?farming will continue tp play a larger ana larger part both in settling foreign claims against us aud procuring us for* sign commodities, after feeding our own population. Jt would seem as if Uio return to the country of the surplus (and now ill-fed, ill-lodged, and discontented aurplus) population of the towns, which pbllan* thrpputa have begun to advocate and w? for, ought not to be difficult to bring about. The cities being plainly overcrowded by the drift into them of country people attracted by the prodigious activ* ity of manufacturing Industrv and of ex* change and epeculation, the idle, the tin* happy, and the destitute ought, it ia said, to aally out promptly and resume the purA and healthy life of tillers of thei soil, Every now and then one reads in1 the newspapers one of thone articles o! advice in which the late Horace Greeley was aticli a proficient, calling on the im< poveriehed city laborer and artisan and clerk to atart out on the country roads with the full assurance that they will Gnd work and welcome at almost any farm-house (hey come to. There ia one thing, however, that well-meaning promoter* of the exodus j from the city to the country are apt to forget. and that is, that it ia much easier to drift from the farm to the workshop or I a store than from the workshop or store | to the farm. Capital, in fact, Hows from the ctty to the country far more easily than labor. Work on a farm is more or I less repulsive to all men, from its aeverl* ty and exposure to the weather. There is hardly anybody engaged in it who would not like to exchange it, if ho could, for occupation needing less muscle, anu capable of being pursued under corer, and with greater neatness and cleanliness, and with more company, and greater opportunities for aumaeuient. The young farmer, therefore, generally longs to "clerk it" in the nearest town, and having "clerked it" awhile, and become used to clean hands, warm rooms, the theatre, anil the concert-room, he will submit to almost any privation Booner than go back to the hoe and the plough and the windy field. Even the day laborer it apt to prefer working even in city drains, with the nroapect of a sociable evening and sociable Sundays, to lighter but more solitary and monotonous labor on the farm. In fact, a man who has even for a year led n city life in any calling Ik apt to be spoilt for agriculture, and will try all aorta of dodgea rather than go back to it. On the other hand, the jjaaaage from the farm to the city is easy, and it in the dream of moat farm youths to make it. They hear of the fortune* won in the cities by "poor boya" like themselves from their own neighborhood, and they are impressed by the well-cut clothes, and white hands, and wonderful stories of city gaiety of their friends who sell dry good* or hardware in the nearest great town. Our sytem of popular education, too, and our popular literature, have much to do with creating a distaste for farm life and small gains. They sharpen the wits just enough to make solitude very irksome and till the head with vngue ambition. TheeHect of this policy on the growth of the cities, too, haa been most unhealthy, and has made the problem of municipal government a very serious one for American nocietv, bv stopping the tide of foreign immigration on its way to the Went. Ho long ad the growth of American citien was natural, their population wan increased bjr men who had learned the art of local self-government, ami acquired their political conscience in the country. Under the forcing system they have been built up by vast accretions of ignorant foreigners, whose first experience of politico irt acquired in ward primaries, ami who learn to look on the Bullrage as aimply a means of getting jobs out of the public, and taxation as another name lor the forced contributions of the rich to a fund for the poor man's relief. The procees of restoring the balance between town and country will therefore probably be a much slower one than could bo wished, and will have to be promoted by a variety of ageucies. A rational tarifl which will recognize the fact that the average American is a shrewd bueinesa man and can generally be relied on to find out occupations that haw money in them, without bung paid for it by the Treasury, is one of them. Another is* a thorough reform in city goverment, which will restrict the taxing, or rather conUiicaiing power, of numerical majorities, and put the charities on a sensible footing, and thus make city life less attractive to the idle, the ignorant, and IliA viriniia. Annllinr allII ia iliu an fa Sn. vestment of the capital now being ho freely lent to farmer* at the West. We may mid, though it is lew capable of delinilion, and perltapa of execution, than the other*, the reorganization oi country life in aouie way that will make it lets solitary and give it more harmlesa distracttion. The magazine and piano farmer of our day cannot stand the silent drudgery of the fields as the German or French peasant can. Monroe County {O.) New*. WooJaQi'H Spirit.

Among tbwe lecommended for pardon waa E.J, Ford, the negro who waa convicted in Philadelphia in 1801 for the murder of a man whom he suspected with improper relations with his wife.
