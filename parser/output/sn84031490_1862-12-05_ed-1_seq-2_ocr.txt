Bui the receipts during the two previous months (or from the be ginning ol the delivery of the crop of 1802 show even a greater decrease in the supply. As the deliveiy of the new crop usually commences about the Ist of September, a pretty fair idea of its yield and extent may be formed by a comparison of the receipts of the months of September, October and with those of previous years.

The truth is, as has been frequently told in' the columns of the Tnmrxu, the wheat crop of ISG2 was a partial failure, both as regards quantity and quality. Especially is this true of spring wheat in the central and northern portions of Illinois and lowa, and in the Southern part of Wisconsin. Numerous fields In these States were entirely destroy ed by the bug, and owing to the late and rainy spring, the yield iu many counties did not average five bushels to the acre. The last call for volunteers also was issued just about harvest-time, and many poor fields of wheat were left uncut for want of hands to harvest them. The question, how much wheat is there yet in the country to come forward?—is one that can only be answered by com parisons with the receipts of former years. For tins purpose we append the fallowing table, showing the receipts at Chicago far a series of years—dating them all from September till Sept ember, except 1559 and 1860, when-the old crops were exhausted and the new crops ready lor delivery by •the Ist of August. Alongside this we give a column of figures showing the amount of etch crop marketed here lay the Ist of De cember of each year; liECEirro OF IASX Elt.jrT WIIZAT cnors at cm- Boceipts of Marketed by entire crop. j. .. 5.253.921 95-3,i75 .. 8,018.91:7 5,055,422 - e.«42.bT.8 6.121,998 ..13,S(a.fV4 C.5U.337 .. 4,233 579 2,633.156 .. 8.87(5,794 . 6.217,471 ~2y,a3i.r«48 11,03:421 ..16,864,884 8,695.931 Cron of 15M.... at 55.... 1bW.... 2557.. IMiS..,. 1859.. 1860.. 15fi1.... 15C3.... From the above table it-will be seen that ia the year 1861 fifey-two per cent of the crop of that year was delivered before the Ist of December; in 1800, fifty-eight per cent.; in 1859, seventy-one per cent; and in 1857, about forty-nine per cent. It -will be observed that in those years where there was a light crop, the per centage of delivery in the fall is greater than when there is a good crop. For instance, the re ceipts of the entire crop of 1859 were only 8,875,794 hnshels, and seventy-one per cent, of this was delivered before the Ist of December. So it was in 1855.1850, and 1858; hut in 1857 —a heavy crop—the de liveries up to the Ist of December were only equal to forty-nine per cent, of the entire receipts of the crop. Upon the basis, therefore, of a heavy crop, viz: That about fif.y per cent of it is already marketed—lhe receipts of the whole crop at this point will he somewhere near ten millions of bushels—of which we have received 4,904,608 bushels—leaving as much, more to arrive here up till the crop of 18G3. But upon the basis ol a short crop, which the figures must assuredly prove, the amount yet to come forward, will probably be reduced to about three and a mil lions of bushels. Tins, our readers must bear in mind, is not our estimate,—but ouly one based on tbe receipts of tbe crops of former years. We give the data for every man to work ont the problem for himself. Apart, however, from all this, the yrith drawal of so many farmers and laborers from the field to the camp—where they be come consumers instead of producers—can not fail to operate in creating an unusual home demand and also in limiting to a great extent the future supply. 3EE niIIECK-nrCLELIJS COB- The correspondence between Generals Halleck and McClellan, relative to the •withdrawal of the army of the Potomac from the Peninsula, is an extraordinary chapter in the history of the war, the most extraordinary, indeed, that has been vouchsafed to the public from official sources. The first thing that arrests the attention of the reader is Gen. McCldlau’s statement ol the numerical strength of the opposing armies—his own being placed at 110.000, and that of the enemy at 200,000. Letnsrecapitnlate. Gen. Halleck visited the army on James Elver after the seven days* fight, and Gen. McClellan demandedso,ooo troops, aa the necessary force to warrant him in moving again on Eichmond; that is, he demanded a force of 140.000 men to inarch against and attack 200,000 in their entrenchments. Gen. Halleck replied that 20.000 was the utmost he could furnish. Gen. McClellan then stud that he would make the attempt with 20,000; that is, he would undertake to attack and overcome 200.000 men, formidably entrenched, with 110.000, But before the 20,000 could be Sent he notified Gen. Halleck that the en emy bad received large reinforcements, making their aggregate force probably 235.000, and that be must therefore be re inforced with 85,000 instead of 20,000; that is, he would march with 135,000 boldly against 225,000 posted behind the most extensive earthworks in the Southern Confederacy. He would aepept "the odds cf a full hundred thousand mca agnbitt Lim arid make tlie attempt to storm the rebel capital 1 Gen. McClellan has never been counted a rash, desperate, fool-hardy commander, striking before ho is ready, and attacking greatly superior numbers, even in the open fidd. Tet history does not record a more insane project than that which Gcd. McClellan proposed to himself aud the Army ot the Potomac, of rushing with 125,000 men upon the Eichmond breast works, held by 225,000 of the enemy. Ac cording to his showing, Gen. Johnston, then in command of the rebdforccs, would have met Gen. McClellan in the open field with equal numbers, and held the enor mous reserve of 100,000 in the fortifica tions to withstand any possible success of our army or to hurl them upon us at a decisive moment What must have been the result of such a conflict? There has been no engagement East or West which gives warrant for the belief that the Peri oral troops could resist odds of nearly two to one in any kind of fight, unless our forces were posted behind well manned fortifica tions. Such would not have been the case in front of Richmond. The fortifications were on the other side. 37 993 31.400 If Gen. McClellan was not crazy when lie made this proposition, we are bound to conclude that he did iot believe his own story concerning the numbers of the enemy. "We are forced to believe that he invented his estimate of the enormous superiority of the rebels to excuse his own discomfiture and retreat, and that when it became a question of withdrawing the army from the Peninsula and abandoning the darling Chickahominy marshes, the 200,000 rebels shrunk in his estimation to about the proportions of his own army. ' How else could he propose to advance? Hehad just had experience of the prowess of his adversaries in a pro tracted engagement or series of engage ments, which had occasioned great re joicing in the rebel States, and corres ponding depression in the North. To account for his retrograde move ment, he had alleged the enormous su periority of the enemy, and yet he imme diately proposed to assume the offensive with the same relative disparity of forces! Was this reasonable? Is it susceptible of any other explanation than the one we have given, namely, that of the 200,000 soldiers in the enemy’s ranks, 100,000 at least were men in buckram, and that Gen. McClellan knew it ? We will not discuss the otherpoints pre sented in this remarkable correspondence further that: to remark upon the conse quences which would have fol lowed the adoption of General Mc- Clellan's suggestions concerning the transfer of the 'Western troops to the line of the Cbickahominy. In order-to have reinforced Gen. McClellan, mcasSing the enemy’s strength as he measured it, 100,000 men would have been required to be moved Horn the armies of Generals Buell, Grant and Curtis. This would have taken nearly all their available strength at that time. What would have been the result? Bragg, Beauregard and Van Dom would have rushed forward and taken Louisville, Cin cinnati, St- Louis, Cairo, Indianapolis, and Springfield before an adequate force could have been enlisted and armed to op pose them. They would have threatened Chicago about the time we should have begun to threaten Bichmond, and it is not unlikely that Gen. McClellan would then have discovered a full half million of rebels between bimself and the goal of bis en deavors, and have cried out more lustily than ever for reinforcements. Such is the Democratic candidate for the nest Presidency, VTe pray he may be put on the track as speedily as possible, and run on his military merits before an intelli gent and discriminating people. Rebel Terms of Peace. 'A dispatch to the New York Sunday Mer cury says it is reputed that the rebels, fearful of the Emancipation Proclamation, and the immense armies wo have iu the field, have made overlures to treat upon the following terms; L The old Union and the old Constitu tion, 2. The Crittenden Compromise. 3. The assumption of the Southern debt 4. The ordering of the French out of Mexi co, and the annexation of that country for nine slave States. The audacity of this proposal renders it not improbable that something like it has emana ted from the rebels. But they should, at least, have proposed terms which were con sistent with themselves. Inasmuch as the Crittenden Compromise proposed an amend ment- to the Constitution, that and “ the old CcnEtiiution” cannot well be had at the same time. It was the North which des'red the Constitution unchanged, and the South which desired to change it. As to the payment of the rebel debt, that can best be paid by confiscating the property or traitors. That is the quickest, most equita ble and most justifiable coarse of treatment. A correspondent of the New Tort Tribune, writing from Nashville, mates some state ments in regard to absent officers andsoldiers from Gen. Buell's army, on the authority of the general consolidated report of Nov. 15, which will surprise the public. The absentees are: Commissioned officers absent by authority . 1,188 Enlisted men absent 25,291 Total A regiment of officers absent! Twenty-six regiments of soldiers absent! The corres pondent adds that those absent without leave are: Commissioned officers. Enlisted men Total The whole number of absentees, on Nov. 15, was about 38,000. The Tribune corres pondent adds that “much the largest number of these absentees were granted fnrlongha without leave, showing astonishing laxity of discipline,” And still worse, the pay of these 38,000 men was going on just the; same as if they had been doing duty. Why does not the Secretary of War stop the pay of every officer and soldier who Is not sick, while he is absent from duty ? This would at least save the tax payers a large sum and have the effect to restrain the tendency to absenteeism. Tbe lionlslenm Rebels in ..all.fled. The New York Htrcdd'i 'Washington cor respondent says private letters have been re ceived from New Orleans which represent that a bitter fend exists between the rebels in Louisiana and those of other sections of the Confederacy. The citizens complain bitterly of the treatment they have received from the Richmond government. They say that the Louisiana troops were taken to Virginia and Kentucky, leaving no Confederate force to defend New Orleans, excepting those who were indifferent to its fate. The people of Louisiana hate Breckinridge, Lovell and all the Jtfi. Daria party. Beauregard, Pierre Soule and his son are the leaders of the Louis iana faction. Young Soule is now ia New Orleans. Governor Moore is said to be thor oughly disliked by the people, to such an ex tent that his life would be unsafe if he ehoold return to New Oilcans. Qe is accused of pe culation and gross poltroonery. Benjamin and Slidell are also objects cftlic bitterest hate. Gen. Price’s Son Pardoned. The President has given Brigadier General Edwin K, Price, son of Major General Ster licg Price, both of the rebel army, a free and full pardon of all treasonable, felonious, and other crimes and misdemeanors whatever against the United States, committed up to ttelSth of November; Price was taken pris oner some time since, paroled by Gen. Hsl leck, and afterward' exchanged for Gen. Prentiss. Subsequently he resigned his com mission in the rebel army, and his friends ap pealed lor his pardon. While on his parole and residing in Charlton county, Mo., he is said to have exerted himself to maintain peace and order hy driving off the guerillas, and it is thought by some of the Union men of Missouri that his pardon will have a bene ficial Influence in that State. Worm Labob at tub South.— ln a recent speech in New Orleans, Col T. B. Thorpe, the city surveyor, and for many years a resident of the Crescent city,-pointed out the falsity of the slaveholders* pretense that white men could not work in the South. He had bad hundreds of white men working for his de partment, during four of the hottest months of ib unprecedentedly hot summer, on the burning levee, and in the ditches, and drain ing Canals in the rear of the city, up to their waists in mud and water, and yet they contln- .military Absentees. .38,482 ued well and healthy—had no more sickness than others who were not so exposed. He saw no reason why the poor man might not cultivate a lew a: ns, raise his bale or two of cotton, or a few hogsheads of sagsr, as easily as the farmers of the North and West their corn and potatoes. It was certainly just as easy to raise cotton op sugar, m 3 not more unhealthy, than working on the levee or In the ditches of the city. This war Is destroying the fallacy that white labor will not do for tho South. TJn acclimated whites have withstood the worst climatic ii/fltences of South Carolina and the Gulf, and have freely labored in the open dr. TLc heavy work on the levee Id New Orleans has always been done by .white laborers. UnpwaUelert Meanness, There Las sever been a meaner and more utterly despicable act performed, than was perpetrated at the residence of Rsv. Henry Ward Beecher on Thanksgiving night. Mr. Beecher was &t las church, aiding in miking comfortable a regiment from Maine, who had eo other place in which to pass the night. He spent the evening In administering to their wantSjHnd on returning to his home on Brook lyn Bights, found that some dastardly mis cieants had taken advantage of hia absence to besmear hie house with a mixture ol vile sub stances, which rendered a horribly offensive odor. The house being constructed of brown stone, readily absorbed the application, so that it will be impossible to remove it. The perpetrators of such a cowardly and fiendish act deserve to be fed upon their own prepara tion until a speedy day ehali arrive for their execution. California* The glorious loyally of the distant State of California, which la so far removed from the rest of the Republic, that It seems almost like a foreign country, is of itself a triumphant refutation of the assertion of some politicians that commercial Interest and not slavery, is at the bottom of the Southern rebellion. The pecnliar institution which fostered an aristo cratic, intolerant, domineering spirit in the cotton States, is the fountain from which have flowed the poisoned waters of rebellion. Every Southern State is rebellious just to the extent that slavery is an influential element. If the rebellion had its origin in commercial rivalry, California would to-day be a rebel State. If she were a slave State she would be a rebellious State; but she is free, and there fore she is loyal Sign or Xicave. The Nashville J)bj>aUh of the 29th eays says that Gov. Johnson and Gen. Roaecrans, in conjunction, have adopted a new line of policy for the protection of the country occu pied Dy the Federal troops. A bond and gnar anty of protection has been adopted by which every cilizen, irrespective of Ms past political predelictions, is required to enter into, and failing to do wMch he will be sent without the Federal lines, and not allowed to return. The condition of the bond is that the party giving it shall be loyal to the government, and that he ahall give neither aid nor comfort to the rebels, and that he will not go within the rebel lines without the consent of our govern ment. Ruterpriso. During the last fortnight, the cavalry divis ion of Grant’s army, under command of Col- Albert L. Lee, of the 7ch Kansas, has longht four skirmishes, or small battles, taken as prisoners twenty-nine commissioned officers and 317 privates, and captured 500 horses and mules, without the loss of a During this time Col. Lee has led the advance of the left wing. This division consists of the 2d lowa, the 7th Kansas, the 7th Illinois, and the Sd Michigan. They are brave, well mounted trooper*; and under the leadership of their young commanderthey have certainly achiev ed, in two weeks, a remarkable result. Id Frost of Fredericksburg. Gen. Burnside is reported to have remark-, ed, upon having his attention directed to the mud forts which were being thrown up by the enemy for the defense of Fredericksburg, “Let them work, poor fellows, it will keep them warm.” This seems to be the sentiment among those who are charged with the con duct of military affairs in Virginia. Fully un derstanding the merits of the case, they are satisfied to await patiently the arrival of the moment when the advance may be made with safety and all the elements of success. Discovert of New Gold Diggings.— The St. Louis Democrat has* been shown very fine specimens of gold brought to that city by Capt. T. C. Willard, of the American Exploring Expedition and Mineral Company. They were taken from diggings on Grasshopper Creek, at the head waters of the Missouri River. The discoveries iu that vicinity are said to be of the most encouraging character, and entirely satisfactory so far in their results. There is quite a village already at the point indicated. The next season will probably be improved by a gnat many to try their fortunes at these -mines. Good for a Minister. —A prominent cler gyman cf this city relates that he was present at a meeting of the Baptist denomination held In Rockford a few days since, when Elder Knapp was called upon to lead in prayer. That eccentric but sound individual of course complied, and among other petitions to the Throne of Grace, offered the following: »* O Lord, save us from the Devil! OLord God, save us from the Seccsh! O Lord God Al mighty, save ua from the Democrats !” “Amen, amen,” resounded all over the house, and for a moment the endorsement came so strong'aa to prevent the Elder from conclud ing his prayer. Absentees from the Army.— lt is stated on good authority that no less than 07tc hun dred and eighty thousand of the soldiers whose names now fill the muster-rolls are absent, with or without leave. To talk about discip line and organization in the face of facts like this Is nonsense sublimated to the utmost at tainable limit. The President, too, is reported as having lately made the remark that the army is less In numbers to-day than when the last levy was made for 300,000 men. Death op ax Editor.— Col. R. H. Graham, late of the Moline Independent , died a few days ago, at his former residence in Lima, Livings ton Co., N. T,, aged 28 years. He entered the United States service soon after the breaking out of the rebellion, as Captain of the Moline Rangefe, and was afterwards promoted to the office of Colonel, which he was soon com pelled to resign on account of ill-health. . 123 .6.351 .6,484 EsT* France is so anxious that there should be mediation and intervention in the New World, that the New York Commercial sug gests that our government -propose, in con junction with other Republics, to intervene between France and Mexico! The idea is a good one. Presentation.— The citizens of Elgin are to have whet thny call -“presentation par ty” to-morrow night. During the evening Capt. Renuick, of the Elgin Battery, is to be the recipient of a magnificent sword and re volver. The gift is well deserved. F*T An election for members of Congress from the first and second districts of Louisi ana, which, had been ordered by the Military Governor of that State, took place on Wednes day last. A gentleman who has carried a Mexi can dollar for a pocket piece for many years has done a pretty good business with it lately by exhibiting it at a three cent postage stamp a eight. I®” The human race is divided into two classes—those who go ahead and do some thing, and those who sit still and inquire, “ Why wasn’t it done the other way J” Admiral TVUkes JTrotxbUng the Nas- San People. The Nassau Guardian of November 221, calls the attention of the British government to the conduct of Admiral Wilkes, in threat ening to come into port for coal in opposition to the proclamation of the Governor forbid ding vessels to enter'without special permis sion. The paper says enough is known of the Admiral to know that he will go into port and out again, just as it suits Mm, regardless of proclamations and international law. The Guardian calls special attention to the admit ted tact that the ports of Nassau are block aded, and says no vessels are permitted to come in or go out without being subjected to search, and that one English man-of-war is not sufficient to protect English vessels from these inconveniences. It regards the Ameri can Admiral as a man who especially dislikes the English people, and who acts with great precipitation. The article betrays a nervous fear that the conduct of the Admiral may lead to dissensions between the two govern ments. The real fear, however, is that tha vigilance and energy of Wilkes will put an tfitclual blockade upon the contraband trade that has been canied:on between Nassau and the rebel sea ports. • The Guardian also has an item about the arrival ot two blockade runners direct from Charleston, wi’h good cargoes. These : ves sels report two others at Charleston, nearly ready to come out. The capture of two Southern schooners, by the Northern cruia , oib, is also mentioned. Enlargement, of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. AN 

ABLE AND CONCLUSIVE DOCUMENT. Jackson, Term-, November 53, 1882. To the Hon. Secretary of War, Washington,D.C.: Sib: I havethe honor to report that, incom pliance with the request of the President of the United States and the Hon. L N. Arnold of the House of Representatives, and under leave granted by the War Department forthat purpose, I have made such inquiries and ex amination as my time permitted, in relation to the practicability, cost, and military and commercial advantages of opening a passage for gunboats arid arcjpd vessels from the Mis sissippi to the Lakes, by improving the navi gation of the Illinois River and enlargement of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Knowing that the subject had been previ ously ditcusEOd, in able and eloquent speeches and reports, and that plans and estimates had bten submitted to Congress, I thought it bist, In the first place, to examine the esti mates, and ascertain upon what evidence they wtre founded. The authors of these plans and the esti mates, Meters. William Gooding and John - B. Preston, aie respectively the Secretary and Engineer of the Illinois and Michigan Canal: and in the office of that work, at Lockport, Illinois, I found the data which they had used, an examination of which, with full informa tion as to their sources and preparation, satis fied me that, for the purposes of their report, lo further surveys were necessary. ' The work naturally divides itself into three portions, and, taking the order in which they were presented t* me. the first of these divis ions is the Illinois River from its mouth to LaSalle, the terminus of the present CauaL Tbe survey of this portion was made by competent engineers, under instructions of the above named gentlemen and by authority of *he State of Illinois. The maps and profiles have every mark of care and skill, aud|tbe surveys were made under circumstances to secure the greatest accuracy. This survey is the foundation of the plans and estimates for the improvement. The mode proposed (and obviously the proper one, I think,) is by dams and locks. The whole distance is 220 miles, and the fall a little less than twenty-elghtfeet, or an average of ere and a half inches per mile. Seven dams and locks are proposed. Fewer than tbeee might be made to answer the purpose, but by adopting this number, the water can be raised throughout this entire distance to the required height of affording a channel capable of passing steamboats and vessels drawing six feet without overflowing any valuable lands. Greater strength and s£ entity can also be more readily given to the dams, as they will be of less height, thin would he necessary with a smaller number. The tfleet upon the river will be -lo k-ep its bed always covered lor iis lull width, instead of heme as now, alternately covered and exposed. While the occasional ore: 11* wing of the con tiguous low lands, will hardly be increased to a perceptible degree. It is not anticipated that this state ol things will be injurious to the health of the adjacent country. On the contrary, it is thought that this constant fullness of ihe bed ot the river will be bene ficial, in that respect, and that the fears, which hare been entertained in soma quar ters, of ill effects will not be realized. The second of the divisions in the ascend ing order is that part of the Illinois River, between LaSalle and Lockport. This has not been surveyed with reference to the proposed work. Its general character and average width, are however, well known. The lockage is precisely given by the present cause, which runs nearly parallel with, and not far from the river. So that we have data sufficiently full and accurate for arriving at a very close approximation to the cost of the improvement. A survey will be necessary to dtti mine the location of the dams and locks and the precise quantities of masonry. But this cannot materially vary the aggregate ot the calculations already made. *Wc come now to tbe third division extend ing from Lockport to Chicago. There it is proposed to follow the line of the present canal, enlarging it to the dimensions of a ship and steamboat canal, 160 feet wide, and seven feet deep. The original surveys for the existing canal, appear to have been made with minuteness and accuracy, and are yet available for.esiimates of the cost ot the proposed en largement. There are, however, a few points upon which there may be some liability to error. Most of ihe material excavated from the present canal yet remain on its banks. Of course that lying on the side toward which the enl.-n-en.ent is to be made, must be removed. It has been assumed in estimating, that this material was deposited one half on each eld'* This may prove not strictly true. Again, the amounts of the different kinds of material to be excavated for the enlarge ment, are not known with absolute exactness. Cut the estimate, in this particular, are based upon careful notes, taken during the progress ol the work on the present canal, and the par ticular observations of one of the gentleman tamed above, and are probably very near tne truth. Itisnot determined what quantity of earthy sediment may have settled in that portion ot the canal, which was originally executed upon the deep cut plan. Whatever it may he, it is of a character to be readily aud cheap ly removed by the improved machinery now in use for such purposes. These qualifications of the exact correct ness of the estimates are not, in my view, of much importance, but I thought it better to mt utioa them in order to make as plain an exhibit as possible of the grounds upon which they are based. I have no doubt that in the main these esti mates are reliable; much beyond what is usual in similar cases. Care has been taken, in regard to the points on which there may be sonic doubt, ic err, if at all, on the safe side. Messrs. Gooding aud Preston have been for ytara deeply interested in this subject, and have studied it carefully. They have all the advantages of a minute accpi.tlntar.ee with the .localities in question, aud great experience in construction on this very ground/ They are well known os engineers of acknowledged skill and ability, while their character, for in tegrity, puts them above the suspicion ofwil lir*«ly misrepresenting in any particular. Having them, (those plans arid estimates.) I am well satisfied that wc have before us the means of forming a correct judgement of the ‘.‘practicability end cost” of the proposed work. I therefore append hereto the estimate submitted to Congress by the committee on military affairs ot'thc Honse of Representa tives in their report of the 20th of February last. lam fully ot opinion that the plan is judicious and the estimates reliable. Perhaps some addition ought to be made on account of the high prices of labor and supnlics, likely to rule lor some time to come—tne rates on which the estimates were made being those of the past year. The estimate of thirteen millions three hundred and forty-six thousand eight hun dred and twenty-fourdollars (§13,846,834) may be fairly regarded as the pecuniary measure of the practicability of the work, executed on the plan, cutting down the summit level of the canal so as to draw the needed supply of water directly from Lake Michigan, and main tain a uniform width of 160 feet. Two other plans have been proposed and es timated for. The first Is to make the canal 100 feet wide, with recesses on each mile 160 feet wide, to enable steamers to pass. The estimate for this is eleven millions five hundred thousand dollars, (§11,500,001) The other plan is to make the canal 160 feet wide, but omit cutting down the summit, and supply the water from the Calumet, Des Plains and DnPage Rivers—any defi ciency (which is almost sure to exist some portion of every season) to be supplied by pumping engines and wheels from Lake Michigan. For this the estimate is nine millions two hundred and ninety-two thousand lour hundred and forty-four dollars (§9,253 - 444.) The difference of cost in these plans arises from the different modes proposed of constructing the enlarged canal, the river im provement remaining the same in aIL Tte saving effected by adopting any other plan than that of cutting down the summit to thewfcole depth proposed, seems so unimport ant compared to the magnitude and import ance of the work, and the mode on the most liberal scale proposed so much superior on all accounts, that I omit the detailed estimates for the others. I earnestly hope that, if the government should determine to execute, or even to-aid thewoak, the largest scale pro posed may be sanctioned. Anythingless than that would mar the fair proportions which should throughout, characterize so important an improvement. Pumping to supply the sfimmit level Is hut an expedient, subject to the constant expense and liability to derangement of the machinery by which it is effected: while to pour directly into this great channel the abundant waters of the lakes will make a vital union, instead of an uncertain artificial connection, between the two great systems of internal navigation. The great military advantages, not to say absolute necessity of a communication between the Mississippi and the lakes will ap pear from a very enraory consideration of the subject. A foreign power holds in its grasp means of access for a fleet ©flight draft gum heats to the lakes. We have but one small armed vessel and the Detroit river and Straits of Mackinaw^are almost entirely undefended by fortifications. Who can compute the amount of disaster and injury which might any day befall our late commerce and clues mease of war with that power? How many months of time, and how many millions of dollars wonld it require to build and equip a fleet suitable to the emergency? And where on the lakes are the ship yards sufficiently defended in which to build our fleet? It is painful to think how vulnerable we are in this direction. Our weakness and danger are obvious to the dullest apprehension. How different would he the state of the case if we could at once transfer our fleet of gun boa’s, now doing such good service on the ocean and the gull to the lakes. We might then in comparative safety and freedom from anxiety, set about those further means of de fensewhich the lake region so much needs. Now, we are almost defenseless: Then we could defend our harbors and cities, or taking the offensive, threaten those ofthe enemy, or fight him on fair terms. For the accomplishment of these desinbleends ourfleet of river gunboats now in use Is entirely unsuited. As they coulduot live an hour in rough weather, on the Caa there vessels be built, which can pass through the proposed canal,* and yet be capa ble ot doing good service on the lakes ? Upon the answer to this question of course will de pend the utility of the proposed work in re gard to the defence of the mkes. Not .only can vessels be built which will answer these conditions, but a fleet of them already exists. Acting Rear Admiral D. D. Poittr, commanding Mississippi Squadron, in answer to my icquiiies on this subject says: ‘that a canal and locks of the dimftnsfnng con templated will pass ncarly every. large, light* gunboat, we have in the navy, or that would * be built for lake or aea service. Any veasdi 1 drawing eight feet can be lightened to a half, by taking out her battery, coal and' ston s ” He then names several boats of both the river and sea going class which could pus thrcugh the caral, adding, “2nd some fifty vctfils of their chsa,” This, I take it, is taifcipctory c*n tl-i* print, about which 6** me goed friends ot the project Utd dcuble.. • It may be observed also, in reference to the piwetnt river gunboats, that although they arc unable to encounter successfully cue waves of the great laktg, itwiilyet be very utelnlto be able to take them, for repairs tip lo the workshops at Chicago, and othsrtoWns ali.ng tic line. It is difficult 1o imagine a stronger ease of military utility, not to say necessity, than is presented in this relation of the propose! communication, to tbe defense of the fakes. Argument can hardly add to the force of the simple statement of the fide. Not only would any fleet of gunboats when built, be doubled in value, but the vast re sources of the lake country in oak and fine timber and iron, be available for further in creasing the number. Besides the lessons which tbe ship builders of the lakes have learned under tbe necessity of adapting their vessels to tbe comparatively shallow harbors of ihtee waters, and uniting carrying capacity with light draft, will be found of service in this connection. {Their skill when called into exercise by the government, will combine the timber of the shores of Lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie, and the tough iron of LakeSoperior, Into vessels able to carry the flag of the nation, with honor to the torrid regions of the Gulf. Look a moment also at the great facilities which this route will offer for tae transporta tion of troops, supplies and munitions of war when, needed. The saving of water, over rail road tißEsportariou, and of large boats over* small ones, is well known. It has been often exhibited in the most striking manner daring the present war. A lew words seem to be demanded on the more general view of the subject Its bear ing? upon the commercial, manufacturing and agricultural industry of the country. Tue subject is eo vast, tbat I almost hesitate to say anything about it in the parting way lu which other pressing duties will oblige me to do. The great lakes and the Mississippi River are among the grandest features of the geog raphy of tbe globe. Their names are at once suggestive of commercial and agricultural wealth, and national greatness. No such sys tems of internal navigation exist elsewhere iu the world. The most careful and accurate statements of their present uses for commer cial purposes are truly wonderful, while the magnificentTfutureto which enlightened eu toprise may lead, tasks the strongest Imagin ation. The Mississippi system of navigable waters is variously estimated at from 10.000 to 20,000 miles. Its numerous ramifications pen etrate a country of unrivalled fertility and in many parts abounding in the useful metals. On the lakes we we have a coast of 3,500 miles. Their com merce is estimated at the value of §100,009,- CCO, “in articles of prime necessity, to the inhabitants of the Eastern States and to our foreijtn commerce.” That ol the Mississippi in peaceful times is supposed to equal this. It is the union of these two mighty systems that we contemplate in the proposed improve ment. For this purpoee no other route exists com parable to the line now proposed, in the econ omy ot ccst ol the improvement, or in gen eral utility. It is one ot nature’s highways, one of the lines which she marks out for the guidance ef the great emigrant movements of the race, and by which tocography foretells the march of empire. The aboriginal savage traveled by instinct, and noweducated intelli gence can find no better place for completing and uniting lines oJ travel and traffic embrac ing half a continent. From what has been we may foretell what will be. When the present disorder shall hive passed away, the interchange of products be tween the .Northern and Southern States will be resumed. The cotton, sugar and tobacco of the South will seek its market throughout the Northern States and Canadas, and la re turn the North will send its wheat, corn, pork, beef, and the various ar ticles of manufacture, which it can so readily provide. This great com merce wUI gravitate to the cheapest channels. “ Look a moment at the capacity of the canal and river improved as proposed,” says Mr. Gooding in a recent letter, “It is believed that a boat or barge, built something like our canal boats, but cheaper, would usually carry the freight instead of the steemer itself. Bat suppose our present canal boats be used, twelve of them carrying over 70,000 bushels of grain, with less than five feet draft of wa ter, could be locked through, one of our con templated locks, at one lockage, occupying perhaps fifteen or twenty minuses. A power ful ete&m-tug such as is used fer towing ships from the mouth of the Mississippi to New Orleans, would easily towsuehalleet of bouts. It will therefore be apparent that were much lees than one-half of the old prices paid for might, would pay enormously with this im proved navigation.” This gives certainly a very sinking view of the facilities for trans portation which the Improvement will offer. Consider too, that these facilities will be constant through the season of navigation, not fluctuating as la usual now, between flood and drought. The present season has been oue of unusually good navigation in the Illinois Riv er. The result is remarkable. With the re port of the House of Representaives hereto fore referred to was submitted an estimate of lolls, &c., for the five years proposed to be occupied in the construction of the canal, which can be bo carried on as not to interfere with ihe navigation. Tne tolls for the first year arc put down, as likely to be the same, as for IS6I, viz : 

S2IS,OCO, and for the second at §230 000. lam informed that the tolls re ceived up to a recent period, during the pres ent season, exceeded those ot the last year up .to the came time by SIO,OOO, sad the receipts lor the full season of navigation will not. be lt6b than $200,000, and would have been from 25 to SO per cent greater if there had been canal beats to do the business. The uncertainty of navigation in past years, owing to the liability of low water in the Illi nois River, bae discouraged boat building, aud the supply of boats is unequal to the demand. These facts point to the most favorable re sults to follow, upon making the navigation constant throughout, the season, along the whole line from the Mississippi to the lake, to say nothing of the great increase which must inevitably follow the completion of the enlargement, affording so much greater ca pacity and economy. Cheaper transportation attracts a larger amount of freight, and in creases the revenue even at reduced rates of toll, as is ehewn by The Erie CanaL Toe two psrts of the work are necessarily danendcat upon each other, or rather the canal enlarge ment and the river improvement make Imt oue work. It will not be worth while to make the one without the other. It is stated that the tolls on the Erie Car.al forlSGl were §3,800,000. It cos: $10,000,000, and is 353 miles long. This proposed im provement is 316 miles long, of much greater capacity than the Eric, and'ean be completed for $13,340, 824. From a fair comoarUon of the two works, whatmay be expected of this ? It will draw trade from down the Mississippi, from the base of the Rocky Mountains, bv way of the Missouri and the Yellowstone. The whole of the western half of the Missis sippi system will be naturally tributary to it. "While in turn it will pour through Its capa cious channel the merchandize and manufac tures of the East. It, then, the present con tracted canal, ninety-six miles long, and without facilities for doing all the business offered in a season of good navigation yields §260,000, may we not ilrmly expect that when the whole line of 316 miles is opened on the proposed scale, reducing the cost of transpor tation in proportion, It may yield five times that amount. Or, if the work should cost §13.500,000, the intension Us cost at six per cent.would be 

§BIO.OOO. Taking the tolls to be derived from the enlarged work, shortly after comple tion at only lour times what they are for the present year the amount would be §1,040.000, which would pay and loan—§33o,- CCO per annum for repairs and superintend ence. etc. Surely this may be considered altogether within bounds, when we look at the growth of the country now going on, and the addi tional stimulus, which such a work would give. The country which will seek this route for its commerce, has hardly commenced its agri cultural development; hardly one acre inten is under cultivation, and in large portions not one in a hundred. The want of facilities for transporting produce now represses the growth of this region, by tending to reduce tbe price of its products below a remunerative point. The East Is directly interested in this matter. Any considerable reduction in the cost of transportation here, would cheapen the food of every operative in the Eastern manufactories, and tend to draw from Europe the skilled labors we so much need. Another point is worth mentioning—the ef fect of such'a work in increasing theassessi ble value of property in the region more di rectly effected by it. Of course nothing very definite can be arrived at in this direction. Anolcguy may help ns as to some approxi mation to the amount. One of the projectors of the Erie Canal estimated its effect in this way: in five years, at full §400,000,000. And the differences between the two cases are all in favor of that under consideration. In the vast region communicating almost imme diately with thte line, nearly the whole of the lard is capable of profitable cultivation, and only wails increased means of transporta tion. to be brought rapidly into use. Bat is the work Rational, so that Congress may right fully execute it ? A glance at the map will furnish a sufficient answer. . Let the eye fol low up the Missiesippi.and crossing over to the Laker, dwell a moment upon the line of this work. How little labor and expense will sut fice to effect a union between these two great systems of water? As the ob server looks and thinks, the greatness of the idea will more and more open upon him. Its military and commercial bearings will develop into vaster proportions, till he will see that nowhtre is there a work to com pare with it In Importance, except perhaps tbe projected canals across the isthmuses of Darien and Suez.

IMPORTANT FROM MEMPHIS Sen. Hovcy Crosses and Penetrates to the Tallahatchie. Destruction of Germantown' Condition of Affairs _in Ar kansas. [Correspondence Chicago Tribune ] Memphis, Nov. 39,1851. X have more particular news about til* Hele ns expedition. The troops debarked at Delhi, twelve miles below Helena, and it is under stood that they will march over to the Talla hatchie, where they will cross the stream by a pontoon bridge. The cavalry will then make for the Central Railroad bridge over the Talle hatchie, which connects Jackson with Grena da, and destroy it. This will break np all communication, and compel the Confederates to fall back. It is also stated tbat the whole force will move upon Grenada, bat I don’t be lieve it. "We have a report that some stragglers from the army moving out of Memphis set fire to and destroyed the town of Germantown. Gen. Smith had the guilty parties shot. There wa? a fight among them, and some ten or twelve were shot. Ic is also reported that a pari of the beggage train was cut off near Coldwater yesterday and a number of prison ers taken. The whole town is greatly excited to-day over General Order No. S. issued by. Grant, which has been construed to mean that every man who buys a paper of pins or anything to cat or wear shall take the oath. Ido not believe that the authorities will enforce such a construction.. The order was published iu the Tribune of the 26th, and goes iato effect here on the 15th proximo. * [From, the Memphis Bulletin 30th.] We learn that the famous “Bob BUck” the hackman who recently killed a Missouri soldier in front of the Worsham House has organized a band of robbers, who are on the public roads only a tew miles from town, and that -they are plying their hellish vocation with considerable success. Yesterday afternoon as Elijah Brooks was going home, he was attacked at the bridge on the State Ling road, about six miles from tows, by six meu who had put ou uniforms in order the better to carry out their wicked imposes. They were well armed, and took $l,lOO from him, §BOO of which was in gold We may expect to hear of other and similar acts of these desperadoes. The reported destruction of Germantown is confirmed. It is said that it was at the in stance of irresponsible parties, who have since jisdd for their lolly with their lives! General sherman, no more than General Grant, will permit irresponsible burning, and straggling from his ranks. We have a few additional particulars of the sicking of the Black Hawk, already noticed. It teems the Black Hawk was going down the river about 11 o’clock Fridaynithc, and when near President’s Island, was met by the White Cloud bound up. The latter signaled the Black Hawk properly, and was replied to. Afterwards, the Black Hawk, on approaching very, near, made a different signal, and a£ tempted to pass the White Cloud on the other side, but in doing so the White Cloud siiuck the Black Hawk forward of her boilers when she careened over toward the White Cloud, and all except three negroes escaped The Black Hawk floated down several miles and then sunk. The pilot of the Black Hawk was entirely to blame. The Black Hawk was the property of our fellow citizen N: P. Tallmadge, who was aboard at the time of the accident, and who escaped from the wreck with most of tbe val uables, reaching the city ou the White Cloud last night. The Black Hawk was a small craft, engaged in the cotton trade, and was valued at about ss,ooo—a total loss to her owner. 

COTTON DESTRUCTION IN ARKANSAS. [From the Memphis Argus, 2Dlh 1 From a gentleman who has recently visited Chicot, Drew, Bradley, Ashley and Desha counties, Arkansas, we learn that nearly every bale of cotton in those counties has been de stroyed. It is bis opinion that not 100 bales of the staple could be collected in those five counties. The torch has been successfully applied by the roving guerillas. Farmers who had tried to hide two or three bales were compelled to tell where it was when called upon and see ir. destroyed, deveml guerilla companies have remained in those counties for the express purpose of destroying cortoa, and from ail acounts seem to have*performed their work to their entire satisfaction. mmm sf iohiibeis.

The galleries in both bonces were well filled with mjliiary and civilians, but owing to the imi-lcasant weather, bat lew ladies made their appearance. The seats reserved lor the diplo- XL-bt'.c corps were vacant. The Chaplain, R-;v. ilr.

All the prominent members are here except Ttaddeus Stevens. But part of the Southern members are here.

Vallandigham is on hand, and does not seem to be very much crest-fallen at his repudiation at the late elec tion- Cos, of Ohio, and Crittenden, of Ken tucky, 'were noticed reading the President’s message,-which was furnished in pamphlet form as soon as the House was opened by the Speaker, commencivg at the irrepressible dis cussion of the emancipation proclamation. Colonel Van "Wyck, of New York, is the only member who sports the shoulder straps. He left his regiment at Xorktowu, and during the present inaction, he comes to look after the interests of his constituents. The burly form of OwenLovejoy moves around, receiv ing the congratulations of others at hh re election. John Covode, Schuyler Colfax, and Henry L. Dawes, the working members of the present Congress, were in their seats as promptly as the Speaker’s hammer felL la the Senate there did not seem to be more interest than in the Honse, the President’s Mi ssage absorbing everything else. Senator Cowan was present, bnt we did not notice Senator Wilmot. Among the leading men were. Senators Wilson, Sumner, Chandler, ** Jim Lane,” Harris and Sherman. The new Senator from Oregon took his seat. The great source of attraction for visitors and Members is the great painting of Lentzs —“Westward the Star of Empire Tabes its Way,” in the stairway ascending to the galler ies of the Honse. Many opinions were ex pressed; all admired. Some went into ecsta cks over the beautifnl landscape in the dis tance, the craggy rocks, the sturdy pioneer clambering over the mountains, while his faithful flock follow the Indian guide. The life-like expressions given to the group almost tempted them to speak out to the gaping crowd that thronged the stairway all day. It must be seen to recognize its beauty. No de scription can do it justice, let alone a hastily written telegram. Both Houses adjourned immediately after reading the Message. THE 

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. It Is universally conceded that the argu ments in the President’s message in*favor of emancipation, and against the dissolution, of the Union, are the strongest ever made. Some comment Is made upon the fact of his not mentioning his plans for the future con duct of the war, but that it is best to conceal all from the enemy "is not denied. 

ABSENTEES PROM THE ARHT. It is stated on good authority that no less than one hundred and eighty thousand -of the soldiers whose names now fill the muster rolls are absent, with or without leave. To talk about discipline and organization in the face ot facts like this is nonsense sublimated to the utmost attainable limit The President, too, is reported as having lately made the remark that the army is less in numbers to-day than when the last levy was made for 300.000 men. THE 

FAILURE AT FALMOUTH. It is no longer a question that the army of the Potomac ewes its failure to cross the Rappahannock promptly, on its arrival, to ’ inexcusable delay In the famishing of pontoon bridges and means of transpor tation. From this cause, the most magnificent military movement of the war, and ooe which, if promptly executed, could scarcely fail of success, has been ruined in its first step; and the army on which, more than any other, de pends the hope of the nation, again placed in a critical position, necessitating an entire change in the programme for its operations. Once in possession of Fredericksburg and be yond the river, the army would have found a* sandy country, whose roads are rather Im- S roved than injured by the rain; and one oubts that a continuation of their first rapid ity of movement would have practically taken the enemy by surprise, and enabled them to enter Richmond beyond the power of the rebels to prevent. RUMORED REMOVAL OF GEN. MEIGS. The rumors in regard to Gen. Meigs’ remov al are numerous and positive on both sides: his opponents affirming the certainty of his displacement, and he scouting the idea, with - characteristic poritiveness. It is probably untrue that Gen. Burnside demanded the re moval of Gen. Meigs, though known, to he greatly incensed at the delinqulncies iu his de partment, and lajing the fault directly at his door. * I RUMORED ARREST. t . • Gen.

In pursuance of an invitation from the Win nebago County Agricultural Society, a con vention of the sorghum growers and manu facturers of the Northwestern States assembled alibis city to-day. The attendance is quite large—perhaps larger than any ever held rep resenting the same interests; and much in terest Is attached lo the proceedings. The samples of sjrup and sugar also exceed in number and quality any previous exhibition ever made. The Convention was called to order at 11 o’clock by Dr. R. P. Lane,Prcsidsut oftheWia nebago Agricultnral Society, and nominated D. 8. Pardee, Esq., for temporary Chairman and L Hyatt Smith, for Secretary. ’ On motion, a Committee on Permanent Or ganization was appointed, consisting ofH. P. Kimball, of Winnebago, A T. Moss, of Boone, Thomas A. Galt of Whiteside, C. L. Patrick of Independence, lowa, and Daniel Leeter of CarrolL On motion, a committee was appointed to present a programme of business and subjects for discussion. The committee consists of C. W. Murtfeldt of Winnebago, N. Smedley of Boone, D. S. Pardee of Winnebago, and V, R. Beach, of lowa. The Committee on Business reported the following for discussion: Ist. The beat seed; 2d. The soil and mode of its preparation; 3d. Mode of cultivation; 4th. The machinery used for its manufacture. The Convention then adjourned until 1 o’clock. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. The committee on permanent organization reported as follow: F/etidoit—Dr, R. P. Lane of Winnebago. T\ceFretidenis-J. M. Morse of lowa, O. R. Olmsted of Wisconsin, and C. Cory of In diana. Secretaries—l. Hyatt Smith of the Rockford Register, S. Y. R. Iliekox of the Chicago Tribune, W. W. Corbett of the Prairie Farm <r, and J. Bonham of the Farmers' Advocate. The first subject for discussion was SEEDS AND THEIR PREPARATION. Mr. Murtfeldt of 'Winnebago said hia ex perience was that the small Chinese cane was the best. The cane is smaller, hut then it is fatter, contains more saccharine matter. Pre fers the main stalk fer seed. Mr. Olmsted of Wisconsin agreed with Mr. Murtfeldt that the small Chinese was the best. Mr. Huntington of Winnebago had. pur chased Imphee, and got no crop. His neigh bor got some Imphee and it succeeded. He was not quite sure his was Imphee, but he bought it for that. He was under the impres sion at first, that Imphee ripened first, but his experience proved the contrary. Mr. Pardee preferred what is called the small African sorghum. Verv little if any other succeeded with him. Yet- he had bought what was called African Imphee, and planted it alongside of sorghum, and in its growth and maturity could see no difference between that and sorghum, and came to the conclusion that he hsd been deceived in the purchase, and that it was all sorghum. Hoes not know but what the noa-suecess of the Imphee this season was owing to the late spring. The seed did not certainly ripen. In a longer sea son it might do better. He thinks the small sorghum is what some call Imphee. Mr. Cory, of Indiana, asked if the speaker, in speaking of the difference between small sorghum and large sorghum, did not mean African Imphee and Chinese sorghum ? Several answered that they regarded both as sorghum. Mr. Seward, of Winnebago, said up his way they had three kinds of Imphee, two of black and one ot yellow. The kind they use was small black Imphee. The yellow is small and grows ripe earlier. The later makes the best syrup. The yellow imphee makes syrup, but it has a vegetable taste. We therefore like the late best. We should prefer sorghum, but it is not so sure a crop. Mr. Cory said that in Indiana they gave preference to the large Sorghum, or Chinese sugarcane. They have not given imphee much cf a trial Mr. Moss of lowa has seen five kinds of Im plies and two of Sorgnum. Dues note the dit lermce in ike kinds. With him imphee would come ud in half the time. He put his Im pl ee into a vat, where [he boiled it, and it eventually became solid sugar, and white in the vat he stirred it about once a week. Black imphee does not grauulae; yellow Imphee and Sorghum dees. He exhibited a sample of each to prove this. j. H. Frink of McHenry, has ra»?ed three different kinds of Sorghum—two of Imphee and one kind called oy both names. He thicks the medium sized the bast which is now cultivated. Has raised the Urge, but preferred the medium. He has raised other kinds, but had not- a good opinion of them. He hss used the seed from the same kind fur two years running, and the last year it was nttar failure—the stalk contained no sac charine matter. He saw no indications that it bed hybridized. The larger Chinese cane has two or three devices ItcS of saccharine natter than the small! Mr. Muss ot Buoijc county Is well satisfied that the same kind of cone in different soils and localities'will va-y two weeks intherlpea irg. The small, yellow Lnnbee, when plant cc in the right time and place, coou-s up very quick. _ The Suine seed planted where it is cold will produce very Email aud very poor cane. Our Euil being a dark prairie loam, makes the liupbte later than tne Sorghum, My Imphee the past season did not ripen, while my Chinese did. There is at least two weeks difference between them. Ol the Im phee prefers the smull_ Yellow. Prefers it grown about seven lett h%h. Fat seven or light seeds in a hill and you get no suckers, bui put in only three or four seeds, and you gel plenty of suckers. . For granulating pur poses, the seed should be perfectly ripe before you cut the caue. Mr. Huntington of Rockford, Inquired whether or no seeds deteriorated In this cli mate, by reason ot the and whether it is necessary to sand to more genial climates to obtain new seed. It is certain the seed de teriorates. "What is the cause and the remedy? Capt. "Weldon ot Rockford, said that in trop ical climates, the seed became valueless in lour or five years, and to get new seeds they planted the joints of the cane in cellars audin other warm places, and get new seeds from the joints. He thought that seed deteriorated -in ad parts ol the world. Mr. Scott of Winnebago, had used the black implies, but likes sorghum the best. He con siders bis seed as good now as when he com menced planting five years ago. He cannot see that it has deteriorated. Has planted his cane alongside of Indian corn. Never saw any indication of hybridization. Mr. Paul agreed with the previous speaker that the seed did not deteriorate, on the con trary, he thinks it improves by age. Mr. Cory of Indiana, in his experience, thonght the seed had deteriorated. When the prospect was good he would save the seed, but when it was poor, he tlirew away the seed. He prefers the Chinese cane—it makes a pleasanter article for home use. The Imphee has a bad taste, which my customers do not like. We have not had the kind of imphee which is cultivated here. Sir. Paul thought it very difficult to keep the diflt rent kinds of seed apart. Has seen seed that looked well, bnt was good for noth ing. When the cane produces poorly, I bum the seed. Mr. Mur-L Idt said that the seed in the Southern States had to be renewed once in three cr four years. In the Wesfclndia Islands it- is not so. He would recommend that the joints of one be planted in the cellar, and from thtm raise new seed. The three or four lower joints sbou’d be used for this purpose. Keep them out of doors until there is danger of frost, andjhen plant them in the cellar. . Dr. Baker of Winnebago, had traveled South. There they renewed their cane once in three years by planting the joints and thus getting new seed. He always soaked his seed m hot water until it sprouted before planting. Mx.'Hn&tineton here moved that a commit tee of,three he appointed to take tbe subject of seeds into consideration, and embody their views in a report to the Convention, to be ap provedby thatbody. Which was carried, and Messrs. Huntington of Winnebago, Seward of McHenry and Mess of lowa were appointed such committee. Mr. Roberts ol Jacksonville, was then called upon to give his views, which were to the ef fect that where he lived hepreferud the imphee to Chinese cane for sugar—bnt preferred tbe Chinese cane for syrnp. Has never suc ceeded in getting good, hard crystals from the Chinese—nothing but grape sugar. He ex hibited some vejy handsome samples of sugar made from Imphee. The second proposition was then taken up. THE BEST soil/ AND MODE OF PREPARATION. Mr. Frink of McHenry county was for a pure clay soil. He could make the best syrnp from clay ground. In fact, the poorest sou was the best soil—it makes the best syrup. Cow-yards, etc., should be kept out of sight. Mr. Foster of Rockford would give no pref erence for sand or clay. He had tried both. Old soils he considered always the best. He his got the purest and best syrup from old sandy foil. It is not so prolific. The pure clay and the sandy soils are the sweetest. The richest soil gives the largest quantity, bnt the poorest quality. The nature of the soil always gets, into the stalks. There are three tastes in the stalk—bitter, acid and sweet. The first two you will get from rich soils, and the latter from tbe poorer and cleaner soils. He thinks the whole thing Is in growing the cane, and not in the mode of manufacturing it. ' Mr. J&ckson differed from the previous speaker. "When he planted on the richest soil, or used manure, he got the best crop, and it made tbe best syrup. He had planted on what was formerly a cattle yard, and it produced a big crop and a good article. He planted on some clay soil, without any stimu lants applied, and there were no acid weeds. Tbe cane was not of as good quality as that raised on rich soil. Planted the past season on a rich hazelwood, and it produced well. We raised splendid sweet potatoes and melons os the same soil. D. S. Pardee would take as high, dry land as he could find. He would stimulate it in the fall by covering it with strawy and burning it,' and plowing it deep. He had tried the ex periment, and found it worked welL He thought the heavy clay soli made the richest juice. The convention here adjourned until 7in the evening.

Soldier’s Opinion of Emancipation. A soldier ot the 123 d Illinois, (Col. Eina ker’e) now in Kentucky, writes to the Car* linvQle Free Democrat concerning the Presi dent's emancipation proclamation, as fol lows: Ihe wisdom of this measure seems not to be so weil understood North as here. Not only do the citizens feel the force of the Im pending blow and tremble at the result, but the eoloiers to man understand that the South has taken all the laborers that can bo spared from their firms and put them la the army. That if we take away a large number of strong laboring men, that their armies must of ne cessity seller for want of provisions! This will lorcetbemto send a part of their army Lome to their farms to procure the needed supply, or abandon the straggle. If they send part of the men irom the army, it will reduce the number of those to contend with ns in •ho_ field, and we can defeat a wm*!] army easier than a large one. Every man in the army can see this, and to him it is a matter ia which he bos a personal interest, for in pro portion as their armies are diminished, each soldier's chance is increased to escape wounds and death on the battle field. It is conse quently the manifest interest of the govern ment to sweep the country as far as possible ot every slave capable of producing more than he can consume. GROCERIES 16 & 18 STATE STREET.
