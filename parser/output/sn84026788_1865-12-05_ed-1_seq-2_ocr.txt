Some of the New England Radicals are be ginning to open their eyes to the faet that the State of Virginia has four Senators instead of the Constitutional- allowance of two, and are denouncing their own act creating the new state. Spe what the Hartford Times says:? "Several Virginia papers are discussing the feasibility of rcuuiting the State by the ab- i sorption of West Virginia. The subject is j come up in consequence of the attempt of tho j State of West Virginia to get possession of the counties of Berkeley. and Jefferson, a gainst the wish of the inhabitants, by the same fic ticious process by which the Stato was originally divided. If there is any legit imate process by which the two Virginias can be consolidated into one. Congress will read ily give Us assent. Two Virginia Senators will thus bo got rid of. lu fact, Congress would not have consented to the division ol ] the State if the result of the war had been j forseeu. It wtis au act of faithlessness aud j desperation." This 13 plain talking, but we did not expect j ?o hear it so soon. There" must be a screw j loose somewhere. Willey and A au V inkle, j the W. V. Senators must be too conservative to suit the tastes of the New England radi- j cals; must certainly ba known to look upon a white man as better than a negro, aud to be opposed to giving Hie "African gentleman' the right of voting, holding offices of honor or trust, or mixing with white folks upon terms of social equality. We can point out a mode by which tie Times, and others of the same way of think ing. can accomplish 1 he.r desire of getting rid of these two extra Senators, aud it is simply this: Carry the case to the Supieme Court of the United States. That tribunal can do noth ing else than adjudge the whole matter as ut terly unconstitutional and therefore null and Void. When the proposed creation of West Virginia was being discussed in Congress, it was openly avowed that it was in the teeth of the Constitution of the United States, for the reason that the legislature of Virginia had j never given its consent; that the only govern ment of the State of Virginia known to the j Federal Constitution was that at Richmond, of which John Letcher was the head and j front. Congress sv,"allowed the proposition, i however, as a "War 2Ieasirrc;" but the Su preme Court cannot ba guided by the opin ions of military men, or by military necessi ties?the Constitution, aud the laws passed in pursuance thereof, aro alone to be considered i by it; and as that august tribunal is generally I thought 11 be composed of the ablest lawyers I of the land, tree from party end all other prejudices, the West Virginia military neces sity will be declared no longer existing, and the State ordered to return to its former condition. NOTICE 05* CONTEST. We publish to-day a copy of Judge Ken nedy's notice of contest to Attorney General Hall, which will be read with interest. The points made by Judge K. arc all well taken, and if the case is to be tried by upright and honest men, the present Attorney General will never be allowed to decide questions of property or liberty of the citizens of this circuit. There is one point, however, that we think is so conclusive ol the case, that no man in his senses will dare to controvert it. By*the constitution of West Virgijvin t i es of Pendleton, Hardy, Hampshire and Morgan are erected into the 10th Judicial Circuit; and Boreman's proclamation,ordering the elec tion, was for an election iu the 10th Judi cial Circuit to fill the vacancy occasioned by the removal of Judge Kennedy bj the Legis lature. Judge K.'s former commission stated that he was the duly elected Judge of the 10th Judicial Circuit, composed o! the coun ties of Pendleton, Hardy,Hampshire an 1 ..Mor gan, and as such, and for these four ecnntics, he was qualified. After this qualification, the Legislature added 13urkeley & JclTer.-.m counties to the ICth Circuit, notwithstanding the constitution had fixed the limits of that circuit, and had also provided that the coun ties of Berkeley, Jefferson and l'redcvick, if they should become a part of West Virginia, should compose the 11th Circuit. Now, by foreman's own figures,the 10th circuit, com posed of the four countics above i:arm !. pud throwing out the Berkeley and JcSTcrs- :i v. '.e, give Judge K. a majority of between iive six hundred over the Attorney t_. i: But we expect to see it oiik-ially an 1 i u'.e? settled, bet' re the contest can be deteri.;.i:e , that Burkelcy and Jeffer.; jn, are not only not a part of the 10th Circuit, but are not a part of the State of West Va.; never have been, and never will be ; had no right to vote iu that, or any other election, for Judge or aiij other officer, in that State.

COUNTY. Wc arc ?rla>l to learn tlrat the citizens of Berkeley county, are aroused on the sui.joct of their State relations, and have-memorial ized Congress and the \ irginia Legislature, in large numbers, upon tiie subject. V.'e have alwpys been satisfied that t!ie annexa tion of tliat county to the West Virginia cun ccrn, was as distasteful to the mass til' I: citizens, as it was in the exse ol' Jefferson.? No more flagrant outrage was ever pcrj clratcd upon a free people, than this forcible addition of these two counties to " Borenian's concern out at Wheeling;"?unless, indeed, it was the creation of the new State at the time an.l tinder the circumstances it was accomplished by a Congress desperate to its supposed ^mil itary necessities;" and if Gov. l'icrpoint had done his whole duty, we would not now have to raise our voice against " the deep damnum tion of our taking off." But there is a way to get out of our troubles still open to us, in common with the citizens of the so-called West Virginia, and that way is through the Supreme Court of the United States. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Compa ny employs seven thousand men. CONGHESS ,AND LEGIBIiATUBB. The Congress of the U. 9-r and tho Logis aturo of Virginia, convened on Monday last. Tho meeting of the former it was anticipated would evoke a stormy scene, inconsequence ot the Clerk of tho IIouso, with'the concur^ rence of the radical majority, having previ ously- ddtermined not to enter upon the list of meutbers any of those returned from the States recently in rebellion, 'lhis was car ried out to tho letter, and though strongly protested against, the IIouso was organized unon thoroughly radical and Abolition priu ciples,- disregarding all sense of equality or right. The old officers of the Senate and House were re-elected, and the President s Message, which we had hoped to lay before our read ers this week, was not scut in until Tuesday. We have purposely kept our paper back, to present crar readers with the proceedings at Washington and Richmond on Monday,which we herewith append :? Proceedings of Congress. Washington, Monday, L)ec. 4,1865. Senate.?The Senate lnttat noon to-day, forty-l'our Senators being present. Mr. Wade presented a bill to regulate the franchise in the District of Columbia. The bill grants the right of suffrage to every male negro twenty-one years of age, who has resided in die District lor sis mouths, and prescribes unusual pains and penalties to be inflieteiV upon anv one who shall disturb or interfere with such -voter in the exercise ot his rights. Mr. Sumner introduced the following bilks: A biii providing that neither race nor col or shail be a bar to the exercise of the right ofsailrage in the District of Columbia, where , the person is otherwise qualified to vote.? j This bill also provides extraordinary pains | and penalties lor refusing to accept negro j votes, and prescribes that if the case be i bro'.i iit to trial one halt the jurors shall be Colored men. *t!;o nd bill introduced by Mr. Sumner, pi- viae ii where in lb V.i one-sixth or more j of the ] vilation was of African descent, the ' negroes shall e mposo one halt* ot the grand ; and petit juries where a negro is concerned in j the matter to be tried. The third bill prescribes a new oath of :il letrianee, which not only binds the party to j maintain a llenublican form of government i in tho State in* which the party is resident and in the United States; but also obligatees the swearer to resist any attempt to repudiate or postpone tlu payment of the public debt, and to discountenance any laws making any ! distinction of color or race. I i tie fourth- bill is designed to cnforce the j Constitutional amendment by punishing any j attem.t to control the services of any person j contrary to the provisions against it. 1 iie i penalty for so doiun is a tine which is not to I execeii a thousand dollars, or imprisonment for ten years, or botii tine and imprisonment at the discretion of the Court. A joint resolution was also introduced by Jlr. Sumner to amend the Constitution so as to make voters, instead of population, the ba sis of representation in Congress. Alter the introduction of other bills of a minor char acter, but of equally radical tendencies, Mr. Wilson introduced a bill to maintain the i freedom of the inhabitants of the States for merly in insurrection, under the emancipa tion proclamation of July. 1 Hoti.SE OF ttlU'ItESKNTATlVES After the House had been called to order by the Clerk, 17;") members responding to their names, a motion was made to go- into an election for Speaker, but pending the question, Mr. Brooks of .New York, arose and protested against the action of Congress in refusing to admit to their seats the representatives Irom Tennes see and other States, and *lso demanded to know the reason of t lie arbitrary rule adopted | by tho Clerk. After several calls to order, j Mr. Brooks proceeded with his remarks, but i was frequently interrupted, and finally yield ed the floor to admit of the nomination for Speaker. Mr. Colfax, the forme' Speaker ot' the House, was then put in nomination, and also Mr. Brooks. One hundred and thirty-nine votes were east for Mr. Colfax, ami thirty-five for Mr. Brooks?eighty-eight being necessary to a choice. Mr. Colfax be in^ declared duly elected took his seat, and after the customary address, the old officers of the House were nominated and promptly chosen. A joint committee was appointed to wait on the President and notify him that the j House was organized, after which Mr. Ste- j vens introduced a resolution, which was pass ed by a vote of one hundred and thirty-three to thirty-six, calling for the appointment of j a joint committee of fifteen members-?nine o>'t!:e lli ii: e and six of the Senate?to in f i'ro into the condition of the late Confed erate Siates, and report whether they or any of them are entitled to be represented in cith'r I loit-e of Congress. A resolution was i 't'eiT'l ? iviug the privilege of the floor to i'.ierc i : ntatives of States formerly in iu surree'.i' :i. but it was voted down. Mr. Sehenck introduced a joint resolution to an. .nd tiie Constitution so as to apportion the'representatives according to the number oi voters, an d not according to population as at prcsont. A biil was r.Ko introduced to extend to ncrrocs x i?o right of suHragc in the District ci Columbia. .Mr. Ashley introduced a bill i;> jjiarant- e to toe Southern States a repub . ii i y in oi pivernuient b}' the appointment oi' i rovlrriunal Governors and ibr other pur lr a joint resolution to amend tiie v- oastitution.

J Hon. E. B. Hall.?-jS't?I hereby No tify you that I will contest your right tO' be commissioned and hold the office of J udgts of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in the State of West Virginia, for ttie following reasons lot ?That at the election held on the 26th day of October last, I received a ma jority of all the votes legally ca*t for Judge ot the said 10th J udicial Circuit. 2ud.?That the said-elcctiou was held to fiil the unexpired term- caused by my removal by the Legislature, and that I was commis sioned by the Governor of West Virgiuia as Judge of the roth Circuit in said State, which- commission recitcs the counties com<" poshig'said Circuit and that Jefferson and Berkeley counties arc not named in said etnmuissidn. 3rd?That the said counties' of Jefferson and Berkeley are not constitutionally a part of-the 10th Circuit. 4th.?That the Legislature had no author ity from the constitution to add said comities to-that circuit, but that they We're expressly declared to-be a part of anutirercircuit known as the 11th'Judicial circuit. 5th.?That if the aforesaid countics are a | part of the 10th Judicial Uircuit, I received a majority of all the votes legally cast at said election. i Gth.?That by the Constitution of the State of West Virginia "the white male ci? tizcus of the State shall be entitled to rote at alt elections held within tlni election dis tricts iu which they respectively reside; but no person who is a minor, or of unsound mind, or a pauper, or who is under convic tion of treason, felony, or bribery in an elec tion, or who has not been a resident of the State for one year, and of the county i.i which he offers to vote for thirty days next pro ceeding such oiler, shall be penuitted to vote while such disability continues." That citi zens of this State are citizens of the United Suites residing thereiu. Article 1st,-See. 0, Con. That by the act of 1SG8, sec. 24, page 119, the supervisors and inspectors at every elec tion sluilt permit all persons to vote, accor ding to the 1st section of the 3rd article of the Constitution, and this law lias never been repealed, and is still the law oi the State; but that notwithstanding the Constitution and the law thus imperatively dcelares who shall be entitled to the rights of suffrage, you, then being Attorney General of the S;ate, and at the same time a candidate for the office of Judge in the said circuit at said election, did pronounce your opinion in writing, publish it, and have it circulated throughout the en^ tire circuit, (backed by a proclamation from the Governor, declaring said opinion to be binding ia the absence of any decision by the Court of Appeals,) iu which said opinion you, as Attorney General, pronounce a law passed at the la-t session ol the legislature known as "the Test Oath Law," to be con stitutional, and that the supervisors *md in spectors of election were bound tocxeeuts it. I therefore charge that this was ;. i im proper, and, under the circumstances, an un justifiable attempt to influence the supervi sors and inspectors of election, to obey a law in direct violation of the Constitution they were sworn to suppoft. That it did so iu llucncc many of said supervisors and inspec tors, and caused them tn reject many legal voters?probably more than two thousand in this circuit. That it disfranchise 1 many vo ters who could fairly take Said oath, but who Would not do so because they deemed this test oath an unconstitutional law and one which the legislature had no fight to enact. 7th.?That flio vote of Jefter*<~n cotin'y was cast for me by a majority of 151 Vote.;. See inspectors returns of said county. 8th.?That a portion of the Board of Su pervisors of said county, without authority of law, threw out and refused to count the entire vote of Charlestown township number ing in all 207 votes, of which 205 were cast ior me. 9th.?-That one of said supervisors. Mr. Daniel Cameron, served as a volunteer in the rebel army, 2nd Virginia Regiment, Stone wall Brigade; and that another, ^lr. Potter field, was a deputy Sheriff for Mr. llusli, who was' defeated before the people for Sheriff, and therefore directly interested in throwing out and refusing to eouut the vote of said township. And that Mr. Ilush was thus declared elected Sheriff of said county. 10th.?That said Board threw out and refused to eouut many ballots cast for me which were printed 011 colored paper, contra ry to the provisions of the Constitution, which, while it prescribe? that the vote shall be by ballot, does not prescribe its color. 11th.?That at Chapline and Shepherd townships in said county about 100 voters -more or less, who offered to vote for me were rejected by the inspectors, and although they were requested by said voters to record their names upon the rejected list required to be kept by the aet.pt 1803, said inspectors refus ed to record them, saying "they meant to have 110 after claps." 1 charge and am pre pared to prove that about 100 other voters who would have voted ior me, were thus de terred from exercising their right ofsutfrage. A list of thoso whose ballots was refused en try upou the rejected list is filed herewith, marked "exhibit A," and made part of this notice. ] shall contend that these votes must be counted, or that the -election held at these two precincts, in cousequence of said refusal of the inspectors, is a nullity, and should not be collated in ascertaining the general result. 12th.?That at Aver'll township, in said county, 80 votes were cast for me, and placed upon the rejected list, which were not count ed for me by the said inspectors of election. 10.?That in the county of Berkeley the election in several of the townships was con ducted amidst scenes of great personal vio lence to those who sought to exercise the right to vote for me and against you. False representations had been made to General Emory by persons holding office in that county, and who favored your election, such as induced that officer to send troops to Mar tinsburg, and, I believe, offcer portions cf r-aid county. That these troops were placed by that officer under the control of Mr. l'itzer, the high Sheriff, who, in order to as sist you and the patty to which you belong? contrary to the express orders of General Emory, used them lor the purpose* of arrest ing Mr. Pendleton and others who had 'been always loyal to the government- of tTie United States; and who. contrary to the Constitution and laws of the country, placed them direct ly at the voting places. That after this was done, every man, who was supposed to favor my election was challenged, and, if he refu sed to take the Test Oath, his ballot was re jected, and, so far as I can learn, no list was i kept of his name, when persons who favored your election, whether loyal or not, were per niitcd to vote unchallenged. That at five of the Voting places in said ; county. I am informed and believe that no j rejected list of voters Was kept, although the j voters requested the inspectors to "record their names and ballots according to Jaw, 1 That at Hedgesviile, in said county, the j ballots cast for me, were taken, after the elec- j tion was over, by persons interested in niy defeat) and burnt in the public street amidst the cheers of the excited populace, j I shall contend, therefore, that the election I held in said couuty on the 2Gth day of OtK I tuber last, under the circumstances 1Yas well , calculated to deter the loyal voters of the couuty from exercising the right of suffrage} and that it did deter many such from going forward to vote. That said election was held in utter contempt and violation of the Con stitution and the law, and should be declared a nullity, and the returns'not couuted in the general result. 14th.?That in Hardy county I received'a j large majority of the- votes cast?supposed to be between 150 ??d 200 majority. That Abijah Doll}-, Iihinehart, and Muntziog, de clared that they were the authorized parties to whom the inspectors of election should make their returus. That these men were all candidates for' office at that election on the ticket opposed to me. That said returns in i said county were made to these aforesaid partic'S. 'That said returus were ascertained by'tbTin upon inspection to be in my favor, and that they were all defeated before the people. That they took said poll books and ballots, and went with them to Wheeling, or some other piace, and, after consulting with you as to the legality of throwing out certain entire polls, returned to said ciunty and hel J a meeting of the supervisors?who, 1 learn, were only electcd at that election,?at Moore field. No quorum being present, they ad journed to meet at sonte point miles away from the Courthouse, and there finding a quorum, threw out and refused to count the votes of six entire townships, to-wit: Beans, Harpers, - Math ins, Brakes, Barkdall's Mills, and Petersburg. That, at Ivitzmiller's, poll books were deposited and notice given for the election. When the people assembled, they were informed that the poll books had been taken away by the order of Mr. Dolly. 1 claim, therefore, and shall contend that the Bnard of.Supervisors?especially hose elected only at the last election, on the Jotli of Octo ber, 1865,?at that and no other county have by law no power to throw out and refute to count the votes of any township, nnd that they are not by law the judges of the returus and qualifications of any but township and county officers. 15th.?=1 chargc that the supervisors in Morgan county, threw out and refused to count the votes of two entire townships, called, 1 think, Timber llidge and ltoek liap, which cast their votes by considerable major ities for me. By the illegal action of these Boards you have received majorities in the counties of Jefferson and Hardy. You have been de | clared elected by the Governor of the State, I notwithstanding some of these facts were re I presented to him by my counsel. Itischari | table to suppose that he did not investigate tiie uiatler fully, perhaps not at all. In conclusion i do nor ln -.ltate to say and charge that your election l??is beeti cilccted by f rauds most wholesale und pa'pablc, and violence such as never before disgraced t'lis or any other Circuit.

Boreman, hav ing been informed by his "legal advisers," certain well known informers in this place, that the ''Common Council of the Corpora tion of Shepherdstow'u," were elected under the Code of Virginia and was composed, mainly of disloyal men, and that their places were wanted lor loyal persons, imuiediatciy declared ail tho offices vacant; although Hon. Judge Batch had directed the Council to proceed lo discharge their duties or he would have them prosecuted as a nuisance ; and coin luandcd Sheriff flush to order a new election under the laws of West Yiiginia, which, in the '"course of time" was done, and the -loth .November, was the day named, but on the night of the 24th, the "lads" (do not put it rats) held a meeting in the room of the '?chief justice," and up.m counting the "noses," not enough were foun.i, sufheently "loyal," who could spare the time, from their other numerous duties, to lill the offices, and so t!.e "corporation of Shepherdstowu" died from an attack of radicalism. The Hoard of .Supervisors have gotten into another snarl with Gov. Boreman about the land tax. in which, as usual, when incom petency and madness rules the hour, the peo ple, the tax-payers,are made the sufferers. It seems that the Governor had "duly commis sioned" one Mr. G/?>. .< wood, (a very sugges tive name,) to re-value the land of Jefieison County front the books of 1 '??!'). those of 1 ^1 haviug mysteriously disappeared, doubtless, as a partial reward lor his valuable services in conducting, during the late war, marat^uing aud raiding parties to the residences of peace ful citizens aud arousing them at the hour of midnight and searching the houses from gar ret to cellar, and sometimes carrying off un offending persons and having them confined in loathcsome prisons for imaginary offences verily, "the labourer is worthy of his hire" and "the bread of a labouring man is sweet." 33ut to make out a sett of Land Books, re <|uired more ability than he possessed, so he selects his "man Friday," fre.-ii from the land of wooden nutmegs aud not "to the manor boru," and the union of two such heads, made "confusion worse cjnfoundc l," aud eiiu the Board of Supervisors had to say the work was so badly done aud had so many error* iu it, that it would not do, aud after paying a big price for the job threw it aside and applied to the Governer to allow them to adopt the book of 1809. But he tells them, if the work was not done well, he cau not help it, as some 

SGUOO of the taxes have already been paid in, and the people have no redress, un less the Legislature will give a remedy. So, citizens of Jefferson, will it always be. as long as you are part ot West Virginia, though, you may complain loud and deep. Unsuc cessful revolutions. like high waters, will bring out the "drift," and the current will carry it along, l'liant tools will always be found to do the dirty work and "crook the preg nant hinges of the knee, that thrift may tol low fawuing." The reply of Mr. Chapline to Mr. Dow ney's notice of contest is a unique thing in its way, and resembles very closely, iu its style and strict veracity, the works of two well known travellers, bearing the names of Baron Munchausen and Lemuel Gulliver. The ftllgity of many of his assertions are so palpable, that one wonders how any one rnaing any pretensions to truth, could utter them. Even his own radical Iriends are ashamed of it, and say it detracts from thfjir boasted honor, in refusing to keep any "reg istered lists, or -'after claps" as they call them, and not permitting any one to-vote who would not likely support their tickets. It was noto rious, th*;y say, on the day of election, th.it he KiiBself tendered tickets to two "rebels." so ealled, if they would vote for him. lint all is fair to the winning side, and might makes right is the motto of those who love war more than peace.

OUR Cnt'UClIliS.?It is one of tlie misfor tunes of w ir, that mou become irreverent as to what they had been taught hitherto to re gird with sacred veneration. This has been most shamefully exemplified in the wanton desecration, and in soma instances . almost demolition, of the Churchcs of our town.? The P esbyterian Church, though occupied at times by troops, cscaped with compara tively little injury, owing to the fact that its Pastor was in such close proximity, as to give his unwearied Watchfulness and care to its preservation. For many months it was the only Church in the town suitable to open for public worship, and was occupied alter' nately by the ministers of the several congre gations, and always with large and apprecia tive audiences. Owing to the protracted in disposition of liev. M r. Duttox, the faithful head of this Church for the last 20 yeal's, the pulpit has been most acceptably filled by the Kev. Mr. Hopkins, whom woregret to learn will leave in a lew days to make his home in South-Western Virginia. He and his family will carry with them the earnest prayers of the Church, and too universal good wishes of the community, for happiness and health in their distant fieid of labor. The Kev. Mr. Hedinoer, as we arc informed, will fill the place of Mr. II., until tlie health of Dr. Hut ton is sufficiently restored to resume his min isterial office. The Episcopal Church was greatly dam aged, having been a rcn lezvoas lor months at a time of those who sacriligiously destroyed every thing within reach. Indeed there were wanton acts of desecration committed connexion with this Church, which it could hardly have been supposed would occur in any civilized community. Ai considerable cxpentc and much labor, however, the pews in the Cuurch have been replaced, the fine organ again erected, and the House opened regularly every Sabbath for public worship. The Iisalth of its Pastor, the Ilev. Chas. E. A:.ii;r,i:tt. is quite precarious, but. his brethren in the ministry supply his placc with cheer fulness and zeal whenever he is uot able to officiate. The Methodist Church by no means cs caped. lt.spews were carried off. windows broken, pulpit mutilated, and occupied alter nately as shelter for horse or man. With commendable efforts, however, the member" ship oi'tins congregation have gone to work and refitted it in a manner to lender it entire ly comfortable, ii not so attractive as hereto fore. The liev. Mr. March is the preacher in charge; who has been holding for the hist week or more a.- ries of meetings which give promise of good. Of the Baptist Church, a new and hand some edifice, nothing remains but the walls and roof. Its timbers Irofn top to bottom were removed, the windows, door-*, &e. des troyed, and its general ruin complete.? Whether its Pastor, the Ilev.Mr. SHEPHERD, will be a'o!e to have it repaired at this time, we 'ear is doubtful, as his congregation is snu dl and it will require considerable outlay, lie occupies the pulpit of the Presbyterian Church, the first Sunday evening or riiirht of each month. It is universally regretted that his ministrations are not more frequent. ?Tr'T!ie Martinsburg " JV-ic Era" says that a large school is soon to be opened for the benefit of the negroes in that town, and the teachers are to be ladies from Massachu setts. The Era further says?" We have not yet heard where they are to board, but suppose they will bring their board with them." CStTOur former county boy, so well known and universally respected, Jiirr. Thompson. has embarked in the Commission business in New Orleans with one of the largest firms of the City. His distinguished notoriety in the late war as Brigadier General, was second to but few others in the Confederate Army. " Yooua Democracs"."?The imitative qualities of tha young Knight's of Chivalry, have never been more ludicrously illustrated, than the penchant they have just now for Tournaments. This time a year ago, they were all soldiers, armed and panoplied for bloody war and its stirring conflicts. The town was regularly picketted day and night, and the conflicts between the "Rippenburgs" and " Frog Hollow" often resulted in bloody noses and black eyes, and from the missils used, at all times annoying to less belligerent and more quietly disposed passers by. Now, that the dread confliet of battle is o'er, true to their instincts, they hare gallantly entered the list of daring Troubadour's, and make manj a bold and iaughab.'e " strike" for the "Queen of Love and Beauty." From the tiniest little fellow to those of larger growth, ybu may see ou our streets daily, fully corn parisoned foT the tilt, spear in hand, and the bone and muscle of their owu nimble little legs for the charger. The ceremony of coro nation is regularly gone through with, and their young hearts seem to _pulsate with as much ardor and eager anxiety for victory, as though 40 lbs of Blessing's best depended on the result. The amusement is harmless exercise to the boys, and all witness their ex hibitions with a sincere hope that the little Knight s of to-day"may hereafter prove the strong arm and suro defence of our coun try s prosperity iu peace, and its honor iu war. hie "Fkeedmen."?Our exchanges from various directions, contain no very favorable accounts as to the present or prospective con dition of the Frcedinen. In many cases they aro represented as uuwilling to work, and live alone upon pillage. In other in stances they arc congregating together in the cities and large towns, in such numbers as to engender disease which, from filth, exposure, and the want of propel mcdieal nursing and , attention, is carryingthem oil* by hundreds.? In some localities indeed, on the Southern 1 coast, we see the number computed at thou sands, who have died during the year. Some of the most philanthropic of our statesmen, North and South, are beginning to reason logically, as to the future extermination of the race. AVe hope for better things, but are frank to say that neitherhistory, observa tion or experience, give much encourage ment. If freedom shall prove to them that boon which their pretended friends have as sumed, none will rejoice more ? than the Southern heart, whose real sympathy and kindness has always been ou the side of the "poor, down-trodden African." In this connection, we desire to say a word as to the colored population of this town and j neighborhood, as candor compels us to say. j we think it contrasts most favorably with ac counts from many other quarters. Since the departure of ti.e troops, and freedom to the uc^ro become an established fact, their de portment in the general has been polite and submissive to their superiors. Indeed to their credit be it said, we have heard the're murk made again and again, that with the most of them, but little chango was porecpti b!e in their manner. Their willingness' to work is perhaps as good as could be expeet ?under the circumstances of freedom be iog thrust upon them whether they were ready for it or no. The most complaint we bear, is as to the cxhorljitiiui, demands fur servico. I hey seem to have no proper ap preciation of the relative value of labor, or the ability of the employee to remunerate it according to the kind performed. This, how ever, will soon work out its own correction. The disposition prevalent elsewhere, prevails alike here, and all who can secure a shelter of any description flock into town. Many of them 110 doubt will suffer greatly the comiug winter, for the hog and hominy, and bi" country lires, which the old master or mi - tress so lavishly f urnished. Their incapacity for husbanding resources or making adequate provisiou for a coming day, was always pro- j verbial, and we fear will be no better in the future than it was in the past. As their ac knowledged status however, has been now fixed, whether for weal or woe, and we are to be common occupants of the same commu nity, we hope nothing of strife or discord may arise in the future, and whilst the action of the one class is marked by charity and kind ness, that of the other will be unifon/i and respectful as to ail proper submission. A 3>or,? i iiKFT.?Some daring rogue took from the front of Kearsley & Sheerer s store on liiursday evening last, about twilight, a whole piece of Oil Cloth, containing 25 yards and weighing 110 lbs. $25 reward is ottered for recovery of property and detec tion of thief. 

EST"A special Terra of the Circuit Court of ?Je.rkel?y County, Judge B AI.cn presiding, has been in session for the last two weeks.? Numerous indictments were made, and much, other business transacted, of special concern to the people of that County. 31 r. Faulkner ocoupied the attention of the Court on Monday week, in an argument upon the question whether Attorney * at Law were required to take the test oath prescribed by the act of November 10th, 1883, bi^t the * urt rendered no decision at our last advices. The special Term for Jeffersoq, it will be recollected, commences at Siiepherdstown on the l&th. itSTToXEV IJr.UK. the well known Ostler and faithful old waiting-servant of a genera tion that lias now well nigh passed away, died suddenly in this town on Tuesday last. He was aged about 75 years, and we doubt if there was a colored mun in the county sj well known. tf3"*Tom Dixon, (a free negro boy well known in this io'vn.) was tried at the recent term of the Circuit Court of Frederick Coun ty. >!<)., for RAPE upon white girl 12 years of are, and sentenced to the Penitentiary for three years. AVe learn there was some con flict in the ovidenee, which accounts for the moderate punishmeut of so heinous offence. fiSc?"A second Tournament came off near Ilarpers-Ferry on Wednesday, 22d ult., in which a number of Knights participated.? The riding is represented as being superb. The day was closed by a grand ball and mag nificent supper at the spacious Factory build ing, on the Island. Every thing passed off, we learn, to the entire satisfaction of all ia attendance. EF3?Several fine fattening ITogs have died in town during the last week from the present hog epidemic. In several instances entire broods of shoats and pigs have been carried off. It is truly unlortucate in scarce times like these. JatUomM* _ By'! rertiscmcnt, h
