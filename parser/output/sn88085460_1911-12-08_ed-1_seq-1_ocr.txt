THE COLFAX GAZETTE THIRTY-FIFTH YEAR. BETTER SHOWING SECOND YEAR SHERIFF'S OFFICE COLLECTS MORE FEES IN 1910 THAN IN PRE VIOUS YEAR. Olympia, uec. 6—Considerable de creases are shown in 1910 in the ep penso of maintaining the office of sheriff in pome of the counties of the Btftte over the expense in 1909, a? ap pears by statistics which have been gathered by the state bureau of in spection in checking up the offices of the various county officers, as in 26 of the counties of the state the sher iffs have cut down the percentage of fees expended for maintaining their offices and in some of the counties the (-lit is remarkably great. The grec.test reduction in the cost of run ning the office of sheriff is in King county where in 1909 it cost $40,000 while in 1910 this was reduced to $34,000, while in Kitsap county the greatest reduction was made in the percentage of fees expended, as in 1909 1,039.8 i per cent of the fees were necessary to run the office but in 1910 this was reduced to 467.44 per cent. In Whatcom, Chehalis, Walla Walla, Clarke, Stevens.Lincoln, Okanogan, Adams, Jefferson, Asotin and Wahkiakum counties the per centages of fees expended were great er in 1910 than in 1909. Whitman county is one of the 26 in which a better showing was made, as in 1909 the fees and mileage collected- was $1,425.30, while the cost of running the office was $8,44.^.88 making the percentage of fees expended 592.91, while in 1910 the fees and mileage collected amounted to $1,476.80 while the expense of running the of fice was $9,704.17, making the per centage f.89.70. "Country Life" Helps. Gov. 11. E. Hay entertained as~his guests Gov. Hawley and wife of Ida ho, while in Spokane the latter part of November attending the meeting of the Country Life Commission in that city. Gov. Hay has interested himself greatly in the work of the commission and has been a leading member of the organization, devoting much time and attention to the work as he is anxious to have the rural schools and roads of the state im proved so as to lighten the cost of transportation of the produce of the farmer to the markets, which he thinks will be a benefit to the entire state. The commission has done much for the farmer and ranger dur ing the past two years, and the rural districts a-e in a better condition as a r. of the work of the commis fciOL Death Bed Evidence. For shooting a beatt.le policeman Axel Nist was convicted of second degree murder, but the supreme court has granted him a new trial and has laid down the rule that the death bed statement of a dying man cannot be used as evidence against a third party. Nist and his partner had a fight with the police; there was shooting on both sides and in which the partner of Nist, John Ford, was mortally wounded and a patrolman was killed. Ford upon his death bed made a statement which incriminated Nist. but this should not have been \ised as evidence on the trial against him holds the supreme court. State Controls Street Railways. Stephen V. Carey, assistant attor ney general in an opinion recently given to the public service commis sion holds that while municipalities have concurrent jurisdiction over street railways that the jurisdiction of the state is paramount, in case of a conflict, which means that altho a city may regulate street railways, the Btate has authority to control. School Lands in Question. A case which will probably be car ried up to the United States supreme court is now pending before the su preme court. This is the case of the state against Edward R Whitney, in which the state wants to get title to some land which Whitney has settled upon and on which he has a patent, but which the state claims is school land and that therefore the govern ment had no right to pass title to any one other than to the state. A victory in this case means that the state may recover 500,000 or more acres of school land which was once granted to the state but which the government has since given to private individuals. State Treasurer as Policeman. John C. Lewis, state treasurer, was one of the 500 special policemen who were sworn in to assist in enforcing the law when the I. W.

MANY TAXES ARE PAID. j ! County Treasurer Ts Well Ahea«l of I,ast Year's Record. Taxes came in rapidly at the coun • ty treasurer's office during the month i of November and the books show that $10,000 more was received during ': that month than during the correff ; ponding month last year. The num ber of tax receipts issued during the ; year had yesterday reached the 8,400 mark, or 475 more than had been written up to the same time last year.

Whitman county is richer by | $1561.70 as a result of the month's \ work done by ..iessrs. Payne and ; Voight, who came here early in the ! fall to check the county books under the direction of the state bureau of inspection and supervision of public offices, although the examiners left i at the end of the first month without I completing their work because they j could not get any pay for the time they had spent. In balancing the tax rolls for 190(J i the examiners found the Washing ton, Idaho &: iuont&na Railroad com pany had not paid its real estate tax for that year, although the personal tax had been paid. Through an over j sight of the treasurer tne delinquent I tax was not carried forward and it was forgotten by everybody directly | concerned. Being a new company ; and the nrst year tney had been as j sessed the railroad people probably thought when they paid their person al tax that was all. The tax rolls for lsoß and ever subsequent year have been balanced but they were I never balanced for l! 406 until the state examiners did it this fall. The amount of forgotten taxes I againsr the railroad for 190t> was j $932.30. When the omission was discovered Treasurer Duncan at once sent a statement to the W. I. & M. I company inculding 1"> per cent in ' terest to date the same as on any delinquent tax. The company re plied that the tax had been paid but on investigation found it had been overlooked. Last Thursday a check was received from the company for 11561.79 which includes the delin quent tax and 15 per cent interest from January 1, 1907, to December 1, 1911. The examiners completed the work of balancing the tax rolls and check ing the treasurer's office before they left but no other discrepancies were reported. Dr. Cardwell Is Inland Surgeon. On his arrival home from the eas; i Dr. Wm. Clay Cardwell learned that j he had been appointed physician for j the Spokane and Inland railway for i this city. While in the east the doc ; tor had a taste of his own medicine ! and for eight days was confined in a hospital in New York city where he ; underwent an operation for the re ■ moval of a gland from his throat. i He still shows the effects of the or ! deal although he is rapidly recover ing. O'XeU Gets »O Days. Found guilty of petit larceny for having taken a set of carpenter tools from a lumber pile at Tekoa, J. ON'eil was sentenced on Monday to serve 90 days in the county jail. When O'Neil was on trial the chief point of contention was the value of the set of tools. After much testi mony had been heard the jury decid ed that $2". was all the tools, some of which had been in use for 16 years, were worth. Improvement in Jail. This week a new lighting system has been installed in the county jail which is a matter of great conveni ence and safety to the jailer.

A com plaint had been made by restaurant proprietors who are paying rent for their business locations. —. MAY CJET WAY TRIAL. Attorneys Think They See Chance to <;<>t McKay Off. It is possible that R. E. McKay may | not go to the penitentiary or the re formatory for the crime of larceny !by embezzlement of which he was I found guilty by a jury nearly two j weeks ago. Mc»vay was before the ; court Monday morning for sentence | and at that time his attorneys en ; tered a motion for a new trial and i arrest of judgment. The principal i question involved is whether the crime comes under the general lar ceny act of 1909 or under a special act passed by the 1911 legislature defining larceny by embezzlement j for appropriating insurance pre ! miums by an agent of the company. The law is not perfectly clear on these points and the court took the matter under advisement until next Monday. Artisans Elect Officers.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE DEVOTED TO TRUSTS. TAFT URGES FEDKHAL INCOR PORATION OF TRUSTS —WOULD NOT ABANDON WORK NOW. President Taft's third annual mes sage to congress was read Tuesday and was found to be devoted entirely to the question of trusts. The presi dent defends the Sherman act but would have congress pass a federal incorporation law as supplemental to the act now in force. He also pro posed a board or commission to sup ervise corporations under the federal law. The president says in part: "It has been said that the supreme court, by introducing into the anti trust statute common law distinc tions has emasculated ir. This is obviously untrue. "The court never assumed power to say that combinations or conspira cies might be lawful if the parties to them were moderate in the use of their power and did not exact too great and exhorbitant prices. "I venture to say that not in th* history of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered than in the case of thf tobacco trust. "I see no objection—and indeed 1 can see decided advantages—in the enactment of a law which shall de scribe and denounce methods of com petition which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose de nounced <in the anti-trust law. "If the prohibition of the anti trust act is to be effectively enforced it is essential that the national gov ernment shall provide for the crea tion of national corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United brates." "The anti-trust act is the expres sion of the effort of a freedom-loving people to preserve equality of oppor tunity. It is the result of the confi dent determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserving uncontrolled and unre stricted the enterprise of the individ ual, his industry, his ingenuity, his intelligence and his independent courage. "For 20 years or more this statute has been upon the statute book. All knew its general purpose and ap proved. Many of its violators were cynical over its assumed impotence. It seemed impossible of enforcement. Siowly the mills of the court ground, and only gradually did the majesty of the law assert itself. Many of its statesmen-autnors died before it be came a living force and they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to destroy. "Now its efficacy is seen; now its power is heavy; now its object :s near achievement. Now we hear the call for its repeal on the plea that it interferes with business prosperity, and we are advised in most general terms how by some other statute and in some other way the evil we are just stamping out can be cured, if we only abandon this work of 20 years and try another experiment for an other term of years." K. IVs TO (iAKFIELD. Planning for a Big; County Meeting Xext Wednesday. Many Colfax Knights of Pythias are planning to go to Garfield next Wednesday evening to attend the dis trict convention.
