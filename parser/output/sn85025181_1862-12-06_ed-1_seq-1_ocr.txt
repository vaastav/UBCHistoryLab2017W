The Gcnoral, in tho introduction of his rejoiudor, assigns as an exouso for the crit icism on my public conduct that this was merely incidental to his alleged official re port to President Lincoln on tho condi tion of our fortifications, and was not pri marily intended for myself, From this statement otio would conclude that ho had made such a report. Rut whore is this to be fouud ? For it he roieis to tho Intel- renul m flin Intnl. ligoncor of tho !ilst of October ; but thero I diseovor nothing but his letter of four points to Mr. Soward, ditcd on tho ad March, ISfil , adviaing tho incoming Pres ident how to guide his administration in faco of tlio threatening dangers of tho country. In tho single introductory sen tence to this letter lie barely rcfors to his. 'printed views' (dated in October, 1800) rtiUinl. ltod 1-wtitn 1 nn f liitfilVj-k lift miliKn but it contains uolhiug liko an official re port on the condition of the fortifications?. Whether the introduction of this lottor to tlio publio without the consent of Presi dent Lincoln, by one of tho General's friends, in a political speech during a highly excited gubernatorial canvass, had inilu- cnecd Ir.tn to prtpare his criticism on my conduct, it is not for tne to determine. At what period did General Scott ob- tain tho six hundred recruits to which ho rofers in his rejoinder? This was certainly after tho dato ol his 'views,' on tho iiuth October, 1800 ; becauso iu theso ho states emphatically that the forces thon at his command wcro "in all fivo companies only within reach to parrison or reinforce the (nine) forts mentioned in tho 'views.' Uid ho obtain these iccruiis in Novcni- ber ? If so, had ho visited Washington or written and explained to mo in what manner this military operation could bo accomplished by th four hundred xioii in tho fivo companies, and tho six hundred recruits, I should havo given his roprcsen- tations all the consideration eminently duo to his high military reput.vion. But ho informs us he did not arrive in Washington uutil tho P-ith of Deccmbor, Hissteond recom nicudation to garrison these forts must consequently havo been made according to his own statement, on tho 13th, 10th, ymh, or IltHli of Decent- ' bcr, or on more than ono of these days. At this period tho aspect of publio affairs ' had greatly changed from what it was iu October. Congress was now iu session, , nml our relations with tho Scccdinj; Cot-. ton States had been placed before thorn by ' t-Iio President's message. ' Proceedings had been instituted by that ( body nitli a view to tho oompromiso of: tho dangerous questions between tho North and tho South; and tho highest hopes and warmest aspirations were then untcrtniiii'd llr their success.

Thi- requires no comment. I have never boon ablo to obtain a copy of the speech of Mr. Floyd, at Richmond to which I presume Gen. ticott refers ; but I learned both at thu timo and miico, from gentlemen ol'bigh respectability that in this cauic speech bo denounced me mot bitter ly for my determination to staud by and sustain tho Uuion with all the power I possessed under the Constitution and the laws. And hero permit mo to loniark that it is duo to Gcnciral Scott as well as myself to deny that there is any portion of my answer which justifies tho allegation that 'tho os-L'rcsident sncors at my 'mWi' device' (tho words 'weak devico' boiu marked cs u quotation) for saving tho forts." This mital;o I must attribute to his ''accidental visitor.

Woll may Mr. Stanton havo said in tho House "that there are a good deal of rumors and speculations and misapprehensions as to tho true stato of facts iu regard to this matter' 2. Secretary Flovd, under suspicious circumstances, on tho "JJid of Decoiuber, 1360, ami but a few days before ho left the Department, had, without tho ktiowl- edge of the Prciidetit, ordered one hundred and thirteen (1 13) colutnbi.ids and cloven (11) thirty two pounders to bo transported from Pittsburg to tihip Island and Galvcs- ton, in .Mi-iisiij pi and cxas. ThU fact was brouhtto tho knowlodgo of tho President by acomuiiiuicatiou from PilUburg; and Secretary Holt immediate- ly thereafter couiiteriiiaudi tl the order of his prcdece.-eor, and the counon wcro ucv- cr sent.

Indeed, tho testimony of Col. Craig and L'apt. Maynadier, of'tho Ord nance, beforo tho Cotnmittco is wholly in consistent with any evil iutontion on hh part. And yet those "Condemned muskets,'' with a few thousand ancient rifles of a cal ibro thou no longer used, are transformed by Gen. Scott into -'l 15,000 extra mmkits and rilrs, with all their implements and ammunition." This is tho first timo I havo heard cortaiuly thero was nothing of tho kind before tho cotumittoo that am munition was sent with thoo condemned ond inferior arms to their places of stor age just as though Ihey had been inten ded not for salo but for immediate uso in tho field.

JAMBS BUCHANAN Wheatland, near Lancaster, Nov. 17th, 180i. A Strange Story. The following wonderful story i3 told by a correspondent of the Dublin Evening Mail: 'I his is tho age of discoveries, and ono of such a startling nature has just been in ado in an English county that it syeuis out of place in the region of rober fact, and to belong purely to tho atmosphere of tho three volume novel. Here are tho circumstances the namts for tho moment I am not at liberty to indicate : Tho Earl of mariijd not long ago, and brought his hrido home to one ot the old family mansions which members of tho English aristocracy regard with an affection amounting to veneration. Tho hdy, however, bcittg more continental in her trslcs, after a nliort residence in tho apaituieut appropriated to her u.-o csprrg ed a wish to h.tvo a boudoir tu the vicin ity of her hod ro mi.

'There upon it became necessary to invoke profes sional ussiitanco, an architect was summoned from London. He examined the house narrowly and said thero seemed to bo nothiug for it but to build, though at the ,ssme timo he could not rosiH tho impression that thero must bo another un discovered room somowhsro in that wing of tho mansion.
