INDUSTRY FINANCE History will record many marvels In connection with the great war, but none more raarveloufe than the rapidity with which this peaceful, unarmed, democracy was forged into a most for midable military power. According to the best information Obtainable the Germans built ap proximately 360 submarines, and that 200 pf that number were sunk during the war. The claim repeatedly made during the war that the submarines wer$ being sunk faster than Germany could build them seems to have been well founded. The present epidemic of influenza has already proved fatal to 22,556 per sons in the state of Illinois,- and its death roll in New York City amounts to 10,974. It is safe to say that the flu will kill ten timep as many Ameri cans this year, as the entire number of United States soldiers killed in bat tle on the western front. l^fMr. Mann, the venerable Republican 'statesman whose statement appears in this colum, gives voice to the great body of loyal Americans whose love of country rises above party lines. The envieus politicians.^ who are striving to detract from the President's influ ence at the peace conference, will live to regret their mean little splutterings.

PRESIDENT'S PLACE. (Des Moines Register.) 1 It would be easy to have' more patience with the critics of the president who insist that his place ot duty is in Washington if they did not make it so plain that what they want is to keep him away from the peace conference. freedom of the seas The same newspapers that have lor six.years been protesting against too much Wilson at Washington, are now printing long opinions on consti- tutional law to show that he should not set his foot outside the sacred limits of the District of Columbia. But passing by this after all inci dental phase of the matter ,1s it not time to recognize that this war has greatly enlarged the scope of Amer ican Interests, We broke a precedent iof long standing when we sent an ar jmy to Europe. The reason that in Wenced our action in war will be Ifound to be no lesB cogent now we I are confronted with the equally troublesome problems of peace. Then, there are considerations of a more general nature than that. Ev ery means of Intercommunication has [been developed in the century and a bait of the American experiment, un til the world has become in a way .smaller than the thirteen American colonies were in Washington's time. There was less to bind the original together then than now serves to draw the whole world to one com mon meeting place. No matter what might have been [the original policy as to our presi dents, if any world purpose can be •erred today by the presence of Pres ident Wilson at the peace confer ence—and as to this we must accept jthe pressing Invitations of the allied leaders as conclusive—then the president belongs at the peace con ference, for precisely the same rea son that General Pershing belonged on the Verdun line. The president has conceived a large plan of world co-ordination to secure certain great ends, common to the well being of every people. No body knows better than he what can be done, nobody knows better than he how to do it. Why should he be tied to the District of Columbia, if Europe Us calling to him to act as arbitrator? iThose were Just as reasonable who in jthe early days of the war cited the statues to prove that state mlli men could not be compelled to lenre anywhere outside the Unit- States.

(New York World.) If the noblest purpose of the vic tors in this war was to rid the earth of war it must be said in all frank ness that a considerable journalistic element in England now seems dis posed to forget the fact or to treat it as^ of little importance. If this war is to end war, what reason is there for sticking over the And if thiB' war tQ end war what insensate foUy Js for anybody nrODOge that rather "We are about to give order and organization to this peace. nf thfi A11Ies be sunk mld. hands of the Allies be sunk mid ocean! What the United States demands in the way of freedom of the seas is no new thing. If there is to be no more war the freedom of the seas will be gained automatically. There is free dom of the seas in peace, but when Great Britain has been a belligerent It has used its naval power against friends as well as foes. Insisting upon neutral rights, the United States has always upheld the sancti ty of private property on water as well as on land, and Great Britain, we are sorry to say, has been the principal opponent of the idea. If we are to go right on with war it Is conceivable that, with several other nations powerful at sea engag ed in hostilities, the British Empire as a neutral might find ruination in its own doctrine. tJnless it is to ac cept war aB the normal Btatus of men and nations and be always prepared to enter the lists, it should not forget how narrow was its escape from the submarines, and it might even reflect that the law of blockade to which, as interpreted by iself, it has held so firmly may some day be enforced in the Bame fashion on its own shores.

"The gallant men of our armed forces have consciously fought for the ideals which they know to be the ideals of their country I have sought to express those ideals. It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life's blood to obtain." Railroads. "I frankly turn to you for counsel. I have no confident judg ment of my own. The only thing that is perfectly clear to me is that it is not fair either to the public or to the owners of the railroads to leave the question unanswered." Labor. "The development of public works of every sort should be promptly resumed in order that opportunities should be created for unskilled labor in particular. The Congress can at once direct thousands of returning soldiers to the reclamation of the arid lands." Suffrage. "The least tribute we can pay them (women) is to make them the equals of men in political rights, as they have proved them selves their equals in every field of practical work." Reconstruction. "I have heard much counsel as to the plans that should be formed and personally conducted to a happy consummation, but from no quarterhave I seen any general scheme of 'reconstruction' emerge which I thought it likely we could force our spirited busi ness men and self-reliant laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience." and more .• to elect him, than any course the republican opposition can pursue.

Worse than that, however, it shows a cynical atitude toward the high professions on which this war has been fought by the Western Pow ers and a purpose at the peace table and elsewhere to cling as tenaciously as ever to practices of bullying and bluster which have been and must be prbliflc of strife."

BRITISH INDORSE TRIP. President Wilson's address, formally announcing his intention of going to the1 peace conference in France, re ceived warm approval in the London press.

It may be that the vir tue and wisdom of mankind will prove unequal to the task ot doing away with war at once, but that pro gress will be made toward that splen did aspiration we have an abiding hQpe. To this end, one of the first steps must be respect for private pro perty at sea, and another must be •the gradual reduction of all naval and military armaments. The lead ers of the various democracies who, in unity, have borne the responsibil ities of this awful conflict are not likely now, in disagreement, to sink either ships or ideals. THE SEW

One of these journals refers to The World's position as a fine example of demo cratic brusquerle, whatever that may mean. This sentiment bears out however, what we have said all along, that, while democracy is now in power in Great Britain, France and Italy, imperialistic ambition is still influential in every one of them, and we all know that in the United States the forces of reaction are never at rest.

"Well, you see, Winnie and I are about as silly and sentimental as we were when we were only engaged," re sponded Hal Devon. "It's these deli cate attentions that please the wom en—flowers, a box of sweetmeats, a pretty collar pin. It isn't much, but it lifts the wife out of the ordinary, recalls old girlhood days and makes her happy." "A woman's home Is her idol," quot ed practical Wade Guthrie. "Provide for that first." "Sometimes it gets to be a prison. What do you do for your wife on her birthday?" "Give her something useful, of course. Last year it was a sewing ma chine." "To give her more work to do, eh?" "Well, she wanted It and appreciated it. When the birthday came around last week It was a carpet sweeper." "And what does she give you on such occasions?" "Oh, a box of ties year before last a seal ring. She never forgets me. I'm wanting a watch fob. I calculate it will come along next week. You see, our birthdays are near together." "Guthrie will be giving his wife a coal hod or a stepladder next time, if something doesn't reform him," ob served Hal to his wife that evening recounting his colloquy with his fel low clerk at the bank. Winnie Devon and Myrtle Guthrie had been schoolmateg and saw a good deal of one another in these later days. Wade Guthrie was a model man In his habits and reputation, but he had fallen a victim to the old-time fal lacy that to be "a good provider" be gan and ended the duty of a husband. Myrtle had never complained, but more than once Winnie had noted a wearied expression upon her face, the sure sign of a duU home life. Eve nings at least twice a week Hal took Winnie to some entertainment Wade, slippers and pipe tray close to hand, read and smoked, while Myrtle silent ly sewed or mended, and then he dozed in his chair until bedtime. He was proud of her housekeeping capabilities and bragged of the same, but he had been spoiled as the only son of a family of sisters, was selfish in his exactions without realizing it, and withheld unconsciously from his wife those superficial, but heartsome little attentions that keep a woman young. "The pink in Myrtle's cheeks is be ginning to fade," Winnie intimated to a sister of Wade a few days later. "Don't you think she stays In the house too much?" "I know it," promptly agreed the outspoken sister-in-law of Wade. "He has settled down Into a regular rut and has pulled Myrtle Into it with him."

I Hal Devon kept his eye on yVade upon his birthday. Practical and un poetical as was Wade, the fact that it was* his natal day inspired him "to perk up somewhat," as Hal expfessed It.

"There's not only Myrtle, but mother and my agisters wasting their animal's Manchester But for Wade Guthrie that evening there arrived the surprise of his life when the dinner was over and they ad journe'd to the dining room, Wade's mother prefaced the gift giving with the remark: "We are all turning over a new leaf this year, Wade.
