WIDOW GETS A VERDICT OF SIO,TOO.— At the late term of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester coun ty. Pa., a widow named Baily sued the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for damages for the loss of her husband, alleging carelessness on the part of the rail road employees. It appears thai in September, ISO I. Baily was returning with a number of other persons from a political meeting in Lancaster. The train, filled with passengers, reached Penningtonvillc to wards midnight, behind time, and being on the south track, and the statian house on the north side, Mr. Baily and a number of the passengers alighted from the ears, and were on the north track when some one discovered a locomotive coming up that track at full speed, and not many rods below. He gave the alarm and succeeded in getting the people all off except Mr. Baily. who was struck hy the cow-catcher, tossed into the air, and fell with his head between the ends of two cross-tie?, and was so much injured as to die from the effects of it next morning. The widow received a verdict of §10,700.

Thereupon Thomas removed to Missouri, where he spent several years. At the death of his father it was found that all the estate, valued at $20,000, had been willed to his brother, William Ncal.

Previous to the war this was the principal thoroughfare for all Virginia cattle wending their way for the Eastern markets.

IVASHIXOTON, Dee'r 3.—Semi-official news from the City of Mexico, under date of the 17th of Novem ber, has been received in this city at the Mexican Legation. M. Langlais, the Minister of the Treas ury whom Napoleon sent to Maximilian in order to arrange the finances of the Empire, has declared it is impossible to succeed in that enterprise, as the budget amounts to §40,000,000, and the receipts do not quite reach the sum of $15,000,000. There is no confirmation of the report of the de feat of the Liberal forces under I'galdo and Fegieu son. The French arc concentrating their forces in Sail Louis Putosi, the City of Mexico, and ill the ltio Grande. The abandonment of the States of Sonora, Sinoloa, Chihuahua, Ncuvo Leon, and Coabihula, is officially confirmed. In late arrivals from Mexico, it is represented that the Liberals are daily gaining ground, and the num ber of their forces is always increasing. Gen. Diaz defeated an Imperial force in the State of Pucbla, and afterwards went to Gen. Alvarez to combine a decided movement against the French. The Iturbide family have renounced their right to live in Mexico and al! political claims they may have to the Mexican throne for the sum of SKR()(w apiece. Mr. Argel Iturbide has given his own child to Maxi milian, and the boy, only two years old. has been adopted by Maximilian, and made ail Imperial Prince. Mrs. Iturbide, his mother, has been the victim of au infamous plot. She has been taken away from her son after being compelled to sign a paper renouncing her rights as a mother. It was de eided to send her out of tho country. The El Paso correspondent of the Herald, of Nov. .'id, states that Juarez will leave for Chihuahua on the 12th, the French having left Get. 29th.

A SECOND MOSES.— When Gen. Sully, last sum mer. on his expedition o the Devil's lake, passed Fort Berthold, quite a number of Indians had gath ered there to see him and make peace. They com plained a great deal of dry weather, and wished the General would make rain the sume as Father dc Smet, the missionary that used to see them, had done. The General promised them he would do the best he could. It happened that shortly afterwards a heavy thunder shower passed, flooding everything. The Indians were greatly pleased, and called the General a great medicine man. But they said it was a little too much at once. "Well,"' said the General, "I know it, but I couldn't help tho thing after it started 1" GAKROTF.RS IN RICHMOND.—L. W.

GEN GRANT AS A BOY.— The venerable father of General Grant is the recipient of marked and re spectful attention. On being questioned as to the early characteristics of his sou, he replied : "Never saw him show his grit, when a boy, but once, and that was trying to break a vicious colt. It was a tough fight, but the colt had to surrender." —Col. E. G. Chowman, who recently arrived at St. Louis, Missouri, from Idaho and the scenes of some of the Indian conflicts in the Northwest, brought along with him half a dozen scalps cut from the heads of savages slain by his own hands. It may perhaps bo necessary to explain that the Colonel is a white man. —The proprietors of all the higher-class gambling houses in St. Louis recently resolved that, in view of the prevalence of erime in the city, tkey would close their places for one week, and lend their service to the police in ferreting out and bringing to punishfiient the numerous bands of thieves, garro ters, burglars and cut-throats that infest the city. — A war ship, under the Ottoman flag, ap peared for the first time in thirty years in the road stead of Algiers, and, alter casting anchor, fired a salute in recognition of French sovereignty.

Then the bubble burst; fotfupon in vestigation, the mining property was found not worth the sum originally paid for it. CORRESPONDENCE. LETTER FROM NEWBKRV.

There arc two Lncs of steamers between Norfolk and this place. The People's Lino leaves both place* on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, meeting and exchanging pass<*ugt:rs at the uiouth of North Uiver. The inland route from Norfolk to Newborn is 1* follows: I p thejwdst branch of the Elizabeth river to the < iiesaiiesvKo'and Albemarle Canal, sov jtcen miles: through the canal to Bla' kwatcr river, eight miles; down this river to Currituck Sound, 'fifteen miles: across Currituck Sound to North Carolina ca nal, fifteen miles: through thi. canal to North river six miles: down North river to Albemarle Sound fif teen miles;toCroatan Sound, twelve miles: to Roanoke Island, eight miles: to Pamlico Sound, seven miles: to the mouth of Neusc river, eighty-five miles; to Newbern. thirty-five miles. At about 11 o clock A. M,, the Pioneer loft her wharf and proceeded to the wharf of the Baltimore steamer*, where she remained nearly an hour taking on freight fr different points on her route. A little after 12 o clock we were fairly oil. and steaming up the u est Branch, passed along the water front of Portsmouth and the navy yard. J had visited tiie.se places the evening before. Portsmouth looked pretty much as it did before the war. but the navy yard although much has recently been done there in the way of repair, presented a ruined and desolate ap pear.mec. A ."ailiny frigate lay moored in the stream ami two or three small steamors and other boats we'e at the wharves. There was but little appearance of life, none of activity. As I looked upon the melan choly scene. I thought mournfully of the lot ot the poor workmen recently discharged and about to be discharged just when unpitying winter is so near at hand, and then of the miseries which had been brought ut)on our country, and especially the south ern portion of it, by the unhappy civil war. When will the dreadful wounds of our beloved land be healed V hen will oar enormous public debt be paid'' The day was cloudy, and there was a low wailing wind—o.ith calculated to nourish sad thoughts. It i: generally best, not to dwell upon unpleasant suMr. ts; but there are times when such reveries do us good. As we left thes" scenes of mournful interest, how ever, ami the passengers began to talk more freely with each other, the tone of all of us became more cheerful. \V e had passengers from • orthern, West ern and Southern States; among them were several young men who had served in the Fedora.! army and several al-o who had been in the rebel service; there was even one who hud served under both banners. It was pleasant to observe how easily they all frater nized. NI. nv incidents were related by both sides of battles, sudden surprise.-, and narrow escapes; such narratives never created ill-will, but often sympathv. 1 he company on board was, indeed, an agreeable one. The west branch of the Elizabeth ri\ er. after leav ing Port-mouth, narrow very rapidly to it> heed; at one point, near to the entrance into the Albemarle and Chesapeake canal, the chanuel i-. for the dis tance <f one or two hundred yards, artificially widened lo enable vc -el- to pass through. Both th* Übetnarie and Chesapeake aiul the North Carolina eajials arc wide and deep. On the former there is but one lock—where it leaves the Elizabeth river; on the latter there is nunc, the water flowing through it on a level from Currituck Sound to North riv< r. Both canals pass through a low and Hat country; that on the Albennrlo and Chesapeake canal being appar ently a continuous marsh, that on tho North Carolina canal not quite so. t Wo were passing down the Blackwatcr Flats, on the river of that name, when night closed in upon us. Shortly afterwards our steamer got aground, when, as the channel of that river i- very tortuous, and a fog had gradually deepened around us. anchor was cast, and we remained all night at the place.— These Blackwater Flats, by the way, are the only part of the route between Norfolk and Newbern. which is uncertain; there is no danger in any part of Ihe route. Our passengers bore the delay here very patiently; the saloon wa.; a cheerful scene; there some amuse themselves with cards, some with read ing, and others with lively chat. For my part, i sat up conversing with a couple of intelligent gentlemen till midnight. A traveler, who has regular hours for all things else, can have no regular hours for sleep ing and eating: and the sooner he suits himself to this fate the better for his comfort. Early the next morning our steamer was again on her way. During the day we passed through the North Carolina Canal, 'ihcrcis a small village, or rather hamlet, on thi.- canal, where wc stopped to land some freight. Shortly after wc left thi place we passed a steamer of People's Line, and soon after a little steam tug towing a barge. These, with another stcamtug towing another barge, which we met shortl> alter we left the Elizabeth river, are all the vessel- we met in the canals. We arrived at Roanoke Island a little after dark, and stopped at tho Government wharf there. Several of the gentlemen passengers—l among them—accompanied our cap tain to the little village which lias gathered there.— I say "accompanied" because it is certainly very nearly, if not t : uite, a quarter of a mile from the end of the wharf where our vessel lay to the shre, so far out from the land docs the shoal water extend. The village, containing a few slight frame houses, 'as well as could be judged in the dim light', is built upon tho sands along the shore. Interesting memories gather around Roanoke Island. Here settled the first English colony in America, that unfortunate band who, after being left by the ship which had brought them over tho broad Atlantic, so far from their native land, were never seen or heard of more by civilized man. With this colony perished Virginia Dare, the first white child born in America. What became of them? II iw that question interests and puzzles the mind. But memories of much more recent date and fully as mournful, aro connected with Roanoke Island. All my readers will remember the bloody battle fought there in the late civil war. All that lilslit our leamor npod on her vrny down the broad Pamlico Sound; and ten o'clock the next morning saw us in the mouth of tho Neuseriver. A few miles below Newbern we passed the spot where the Confederates had sunk vessels loaded with stones and had driven piles to prevent the passage of the Federal iiocj. Many of these obstructions still re main: but the deeper part of the river, called by sailors "the channel," is totally clear from them. — Along the shores of the river can still be seen some remains of the several fortifications thrown up by the rebels. On the south bank of the Trent, at its mouth, and nearly opposite to Newbern, is quite a large vil lage of rudclv constructed huts, inhabited by negro freedmen. A considerable crowd of the inhabitants of this village were gathered on the shore as we passed: they were apparently witnessing a baptizing. Shortly after passing this freedmen's village, our steamer gained her wharf and landed her passengers. It was, although without any marked incident, one of the pleasantest trips I ever experienced. ORIOMS. tfr. SewnrilS Account ot* the Attack upon Him. AN INTERESTING STORY. The Auicrcan correspondent of the London Apec tof'tr writes that he recently heard Mr. Seward and Mr. Frederick Seward give the following account of their own sensations at the time of the attempted assassination: "Mr. Frederick Seward said that on stepping from his bedroom into the passage and seeing the assassin, he merely wondered what he was doing there, and called him to account. On his resisting the fellow's endeavor to press into Mr. Seward's room, tho assas sin drew a revolver, which he presented at Mr. Fred erick Reward's hcau. What followed, it must be re membered, took place in a lew seconds. Mr. Fred crick Seward's first thought was, 'That's a navy revolver.' "The man puller the trigger, but it only snapped, and his intended victim thought, 'That cap missed lire.' "His next sensation was that of confusion, and be big upon the floor, resting upon his right arm, which, like his father 8 jaw, was barely recovered lrom a bad tracture—the as-assin had felled him to tho lloor with the butt of the pistol—lie put his hand to his head, and finding a hole there, he thought, 'That cap diil i ot miss fire alter all.' "Then he became insensible, and remained so for two days and more. His first indication of returning conseiousnes was tli* question, 'Havo you got the ball out ?' after which he fell off again into a coma tose condition, which was of long continuance. "On the very afternoon of the day when Mr. Lin coln was assassinated, Mr. Frederick Seward, who was Assistant Secretary of State, had asked his father what preparation should be made for the presenta tion of Sir Frederick Bruce, which was to take place the next day. Mr. Seward gave him the points of a reply to be made to Sir Frederick, and he laid the outline of the speech upon the President's table, and, as I have previously nformed my readers, Mr. Lin coln that afternoon wrote out the reply, adopting Mr. Seward's suggestions, and thus preparing that reception of tlie British Minister by President John son. which was regarded at the time by the people to whose representative it was addressed as so friendly and fair, and dignified. "Mr. Frederick Seward's first inquiry after he came fully to his senses, which was a long time after the assassination, was: 'Has Sir Frederick Bruce been presented?' He thought that only one night had passed since he knew not what had happened to him, and his mind took up matters just where it had le'ft them. "Mr. Seward's mental experience during his sup- j nosed assassination was in its nature so like that of his son, that it raised the question whether this ab sence of consternation and observation of minute particulars is not common in circumstances of unex pected and not fully apprehended peril. Mr. Seward was lying upon his side, close to the edge of his bed. with his head resting in a frame, which had been made to give him ease and to protect his broken jaw from pressure. "He was trying to keep awake, having been seized upon by a sick man's fancy—lt was that if he slept he would wake up with lock-jaw. He was brought to full consciousness by the seutHe in the passage-way, followed bv the entrance ot the assassin, and the cry of Miss Seward, 'Oh! he will kill my father.' But he saw nothing of his assailant until a hand appeared abo\e his face, and then his thought was.'What handsome cloth that overcoat is made of.' The as sassin's face then appeared, and the helpless states man only thought. 'What a handsome man!' (Payne vas fine looking fellow. • "Then came a sensation as of rain striking him smartly upon one side of his face and neck, then quickly tho same upon the other side, but he felt no M-verc pain. This was the assassin's knife. The blood spouted, he thought 'My time has come,' and falling from the bed to the floor, fainted. 11is first ,-cnsation of returning consciousness was that he was drinking tea, and that 'it tasted good.' Mrs. Seward was giving hira tea with a spoon, lie heard low voices around him, asking and replying as to wheth er it would be possible for liiiu to recover. He could not speak, but his eyes showed his consciousness, and that he desired to speak. They brought him a por celuin tablet, on which he managed to write, 'Give me some more tea. I shall get well.' And from that m-uuont he has slowly.but steadily recovered health and strength." NEW 

TANNING PROCESS.—The Shoe and Leathrr Hcjiorter says: We uiako weekly notes of these new "processes." They go the rounds of the pa pers. suggest weighty and philosophical editorials, startle the leather dealers with the fear of a terrible fall in price of stock, but somehow are never adopted by the trade. Here is the last idea: "A new tanning process has been invented in France by M. Pieard, which is said bv Lc Novelise to be cheaper and more expeditious than the old. By a mechanical process in the place of bark, hides are tanned into leather in twelve hours. Turpentine dissolves fat and preserves leather. The material used is 50 per cent, cheaper t an bark; the process less laborious; oak forests will be benefitted by leav ing the bark on the trees, and avoiding the treading down of young saplings, while the waste lands will be planted with fir trees, to produce turpentine.— Manufacturers prefer the leather thus made.

The opposition will hold a caucus to-night to determine their course of action. . The Ohio Union caucus last night was attended by sixteen members, and the absent members were rep resented. Their most significant notion was the unanimous passage of a resolution offered by Gen. Scolield, pledging their solid vote against the admis sion of any Representative from any State lately in rebellion, prior to or after the organization, until their credentials had been referred to the regular committee, and the whole subject investigated and discussed. They also decided to go iu a body for ♦'olfax and McPherson, and to follow the lead of New England in the vote for Sergeant-at-Arms, and to support Hawkins Taylor for Doorkeeper and f 01.

EXTENSIVE ROBBERIES IN TIIE BALTIMORE POST OFFICE—ARREST OP THE GUILTY PARTY.—On the 16th of last mouth, one of tlio workmen engaged in the establishment ol Messrs. James Clark A Co., near the city yard, on the satttll side of the ba in, observed a man, at an early hour of the morning, throw into the water a couple of packages, and then retire. Re garding his movements with some curiosity, tfie workman proceeded t > the spot, and noticed several letters floating about. The fact was at onec inin municated to Mr. Clark, who addn ssod a note to th. postoffico authorities, acquainting them with tlio eirenmsLu.ee. A special agent of the postuflicc de partment, Mr. Kimball, happening to call at the postoffiee at the time of the receipt of the note, was at oiicc despatched to the place, and succeeded in re covering about one hundred letters. For some months previous, and even as far back a? May last, complaints lmd been made to Postmaster Piunell, by Assistant Postmaster Thorp, of the non-receipt of letters which were known to have been mailcdfrom various points to this city. Mr. Thorp had taken memorandums of ail such complaints, and the matterhad been receivingthc attention of the proper authoritic- with a view of as certaining the cause. It was finally and pretty con clusively settled that somebody in the office here had been stealing letters, yet, notwithstanding the con stant surveillance maintained in the establishment, suspicion could not he attached to any one as the thief. The occurrence above referred to gave a duo, however, to these transactions, and tho char acter of the letters, the addres- of many of which were upon Mr. Thorp's memorandum book, in 'Hearing thai the trouble wn- in the carrier room, a fresh impetus was given to the investi gation- With all the data that lie could obtain, Mr. Kimball sot to work with a will to find out the thief, and in the course of his investigations was joined by .Air.
