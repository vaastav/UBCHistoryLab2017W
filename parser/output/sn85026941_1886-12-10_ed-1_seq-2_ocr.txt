LIEUTENANT-60VERN0R MASSEY'S OPIN ION. Elsewhere in the IIekald is pab lished an editorial summary iu th Haltiiuoie Sun ol the views on th state debt recently avowed by th Lieutenant Governor ot Yirgiuia. Mr. Massey is no new figure ii Virginia politics. Perhaps souii people will sail it "ancient history' to give the barest recital of hii record. A turbulent agitator o the debt issue iu the Virgin? Legislature?an issue with whicl he nev er had any real acquaintance because he hod never given it ani. sincere study, be showed aptitndi only in forcing upon Readjustmem whatever of odium his own person ality suggested. To call Massey i ??disfrocked pulpiteer," as was iu geiiiously doue by s Virginiajourn alist now dead, was merely to in vite public attention to the decree ?I the Saviour of mankind against the introduction of religion inte politics. Unfortunately for the \U? adjuster party .Mr. Massey, really the lepudiator that ho now pro? claims himself, was a pretended He adjuster, and had admission to the camp of those whom he was always ready to betray with sufficient in? centive and favoring opportunity. Both motive and opportunity came, and the natural result followed. With Mr, Massey's subsequent connection with the Democratic party of Virginia all reading peo? ple are acquainted. He exacted from the so-called Democracy the second place on the ticket with lit/. Lee. The violet and the onion were made essentials of tho same bouquet which all so-called Virginia Democrats were made to smell.? And tho ontbii made the demand to which the nurses of the violet yielded, lost the onion should emit some of its historic odors to the injury of the less pronounced fra? grance of the violet. On that sul? try July night when General Lee's nomination was made at the Rich? mond Theatre amid much murmur? ing of the lately over-hopeful friends of "dark-horses," Mr. Massey and hi* followers among the so-called debt-pay ing element ot the so-called Democracy, made their combina? tions with eminent success. With the dawn of the next day camo the already prefigured result of Lee, Massey, and Ayres. The violet had sweetlv and softly consented to nestle with the onion. Garlic was blended with the tuberose and a mild flavor of chrysanthemun completed thefrsgrauce of tho bou? quet submitted to the heretofore intensely debt-paying and pro-bond? holders' faction ludicrously called the Democratic party of Virginia. The demagogism of Mr. Massey had triumphed to the degree of forcing upon a reluctant party 'whose mob? had pelted him with spoiled eggs, and with reminder? of his kinship to the long-eared animal whose bray ia the loud proclamation of hi? presence, by nomination for an office, through which he might and may yet, be? come by possible mishap to (!ov ernor Lee, etr-officio Coveruor of this proud state. Do old Keadjns ters forget Mr. Massey'? record and fail to commiserate their old timo reviler? for the humiliation they must feel in having to tolerate him among their spokesmen and coun? sellors? Can the Funders of five year? ago forget their self-inflicted humiliation when by their vote? they elevated him to a position which make? his utterances notice? able! That Mr. Massey should be (juoted at all regarding the most pregnant of all question? in the af? fairs cf Virginia is the outcome of the possession of the state govern? ment by the present regime. That he is not a forgotten political dis? grace is the fault of those who made him Lieutenant-Governor, and gave him official consequence. Lot it bo remembered among the example? of political inconsistency aud self-contradiction. It should teach people who have only their own common sense and rectitude a? guides that those who boast most of honesty are not the most honest. "The most contemptuous are al? ways the most contemptible." Po? litical abasement reached its culmi? n?t ien when tho so-called Democ? racy m laSX? prepared themselves to be decorated with the variegated garland, whose conspicuous odor come? from tho garlic of Massey Ism. A 

FIVE YEARS' WRANGLE. Sensible people are tired of the i|narr?is that separated the Repub? lican party live years ago into fac? tions strong enough only to destroy each other, and to give the coun? try much injury. This five years' wrangle ought to cease in deference to the public sense of decency. For example : Who is going to protit by the controversy now wag? ing between Mr. Joues, the chair? man of the Republican national committee which conducted the presidential campaign tor Mr. lilaine in 1S-K-1, and Mr. Chandler, the Secretary of the Navy in Presi? dent Arthur's cabinet ? Will it hurt the dead ex President to call in question his loyalty to his party? If such an accusation cau be proved, is he not beyond the reach of anjr penalty Baa can inflict ? Will it help Mr. Hlainc's luture fortunes to show that his past might have been dilterent it the administration had worked as hard as it could, in hi? Interest. What is to be gained by renewing a factional strife which killed one President outright and sowed the seeds of dissolution iu another f Are there not live topics to be discussed, of more Importance than this dead one? Aud now that a debate on a question of unwritten history threatens to degenerate in? to an exchange of personal incivili? ties, it is particularly desirable that it be dropiie-G. It is a question as to which party contributes most to the literature that fatigues the country with idle controversy of a personal or fac? tional character. se?. ? - THE

Foreign relations an? atiaOtslM by the President with camin? am clearness. Ho deems M complica tionB with foreign government outside the reach of friendly ad juHtment. The President acknowl edges disappointment at the faillir to reenre a prompt and permaneo settleinent of the < anadian li-ln t.? dispute. That ?lisput?? has lastc? in one form or another for a perioi of seventy jean at least, goini back to the peihnls nl Mourn?'sum QoinOJ Adams' adiiiini.stiatiiuis. To establish the lights of Aineii can lishormeii in the debated isa ter? would be a crowning luccesi for the adminiatration. The Preai dent manfully denies the pretended right oi the Mexican government as asserted in the Cutting case, t? try an American citizen for an al leged oQ'ence committed on the ?oil of tho United States. General approbation will be giv? en to the President'? urgent recom mendation of a reduction of reve? nue. Hi? recommendations as tn tariff measures are consistent with the generalities ol the National Democratic platform. Looking at the President's mes? sage fairly and from a disinterest? ed standpoint, as a revelation ol the hopes of the adminiatration, especially when the message Iscoo sistently supported by reports from his Cabinet, it is plain that tho President entertain? the hope of continued Democratic ascendency by maintaining his alliance with the capitalists oi ?New York.

To these statements the Patriot and Herald replies: There is a vast amount of truth in what tho Stati sas?. It is true that some of the Democrats of \ ir? ginia are tired ol the expediency policy of their party ; but a large a umber of those ? ho tailed to vote in the last election were influenced by disgust ofSDOthei kind. They arc men who aie really for Kepubli can piineiples and a Republican platform. They are lor what tho Statt and tho I'einocratio, party an not for, that is a protective tariff, They an? for the Blair Hill and oth? er Republican measures; ami have only voted tor and acted with the Democrats because they were led to think that the Democratic party was lor those things. If they tailed t.? voto Democratic in the recent election it was because they were disgusted with the insincerity Of the Democratic party, and realised that the mils stay to scenic what they dosirod was by allowing the Bcpnblican porty t.? be restored to p.twer.
