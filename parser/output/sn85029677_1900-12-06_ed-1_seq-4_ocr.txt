THE HERALD. eaiLIilPSBURG. - KANSAS. r ESTABLISHED IN 1377 J. M. TADLOCK, PUBLISHER AND FEOPBIETOB On a Year l-50 Sir Months .. 75 Thubsday, December 6, 1900. If the government is to bnild and equip that line of ships, why not own them, instead of giving it all away to a private company 1 The Morrison trial is jast now oc cupying the center of the stage. Oom Paul, the president's message, and the Czar's illness have to take a back seat. The teachers from this city who at tended the Association at Smith Cen ter have nothing bat words of praise to say of the manner in which the teachers were received by the people of oar neighboring city. Foremost among the members of the reception committee was J. W. Morphy of the Journal, who seeemed to be every where administering to the wants of the visitors as they arrived. Every prominent business man in Smith Center helped to welcome the peda gogues. The Dispatch after telling what a noble fellow Chas. F. Scott is, to offer to give up his job as coogress-at-large without making a roar, and how unselfih he is to promise not to run against Bowersock in the second district next time, proceeds to gallop up and down the chromatic scale of praise for his forbearance, and to ring all the changes on the bells of the Christian graces extolling his modest virtues. Bat the Dispatch spoils its beautiful tribute by saying Mr. Scott should be given the United States eenatorship in fact he wants Senator Harris job and should have it. It reminds one of reading a patent medicine "ad." It begins very prettily, but Through the efforts of Supt Thomas, Prof. Green and the other teachers who went down to Smith Center from this oounty, the next meeting of the Northwest Association was given to Phillipsburg. The association has grown until it is no small matter to care for the five hundred teachers who will attend this meeting. Smith Center entertained them this year in a manner that left nothing mora to be desired, and it behooves our city to put her best foot forward for thU purpose next year. We cared for the association nicely two years ago and can do it again, although the body is muoh larger than then, and we must do our work still better. Let every body become interested now, and see to it that we send the teachers away from here next year singing our praises. Nothing will pay us better than to do the handsome thing by our visitors.

As a mere matter of dollars and cents these for ests alone are worth many times the price paid for the Islands. Iola Reg ister. If Charley Scott thinks the more than 12,000 lives of American boys al ready lost in the Philippines, and the thousands more to be sacrificed be fore the trouble is over, is a small price to pay for Philippine forests he differs widely from the mothers and fathers of the boys. If speculation's the game, how are the lives of our brave American boys to be accounted for? Congress met last Monday. The president's message was an unusually long one, filled mostly with reports of the heads of departments, and dis cussion of our foreign relations. The mfamnus Hanna Bhip subsidy is dis tinctly favored. A large space is oc oapied in boasting of prosperity. Be low are given brief extracts from the opinions of several prominent daily papers concerning the message: The balk of the president's mes sage is more than usually dry read ing this year, being devoted to inter national matters of minor public concern. Topeka Capital. President McKinley's annual mes sage is chiefly remarkable for the absence of any large number of rec ommendations along the lines of needed legislation. It is largely de voted to a review of the country's re lations with the remainder of the world. State Journal. On the whole the message will command warm approval for its ex pressions as to China. As to some of the other vital issues of the hour its lack of grasp and decisiveness is dis appointing. Chicago Record. The president's recommendation on the currency question is liable to cause a suspicion that the famous currency law passed at the last ses sion of congress contains blow holes under the crust. The message con tains -18,000 words. The republican newspapers will pronounce it a strong state paper, while the democratic ed itors will declare that it is "pure flap doodle." Ia fact, however, it is like most messages necessary; and also perfunctory. St. Joe Gazette-Herald It is probable that one skilled in the art of literary condensation could have reduced the president's message by one-third without obscuring the meaning, restricting its application or seriously circumscribing its scope But if it is appropiate fully to cover all important questions in these ad dresses to congress, elaboration is neo essary, and the question of degree is not greatly important. Kansas City Journal. Mr MoKinley says that if anybody can find anything that should be done to more firmly establish the gold standard it is the duty, "as it will be the disposition of congress," to do that thing The president, also hints that if the national banks want any thing farther he has no ojction to OOngregs letting them have it. The recommendation concerning trut might mean much or nothing, accord ing to the diaposition . of congress The message, as a whole, should b soothing to the "business interests." It contains nothing to unsettle or alarm them. As it no doubt received the approval of Mr. Hanna and kindred spirits before it was deliverd, its qual ity in that respect wui to be expected. Rocky Mountain News. What it Cost Them. In compliance with the law all the candidates must file a statement of election expenses with the oounty clerk within thirty days after election.

The Herald has a number of sub scribers who keep their paper paid for in advance, or at least do not a' iow theii time to run over more than a few months We are proud of this fact and wish to thank you for your promptness There are however a large number who have not been so prompt and have allowed their sub scription to remain unpaid for two or three years, and some evn morn than that. We would like to call the at tention of the latter class to the fact that j'ist now we are greatly in need of their help The cost of paper and ink, have more than doubled in the past jear, this with other things makes it absolutely necessary to col lect all back subscription at once. The amounts are small, and it is doubtless more the result of accident al carlessness than anything else that they are not paid, for we recognize some in this class who are among the very best friends of the paper. Your attention is called to the mat ter in this way to save the trouble of sending out statements. Please con sult the date on the label of your pa per and remit $1.00 per year for the time due. By so doing you will oblige us greatly and enable us to add some new material to the Herald's equip ment and give you a still better pa per. Good Advice.

Nelson has purohased the engine, dynamo and other fixtures be longing to the electric light plant from parties in Stockton and will put in the system here. Nearly all the business and a large number of resi dences will be provided with aro and incandescent lights and the city will probably be lighted also. Boone Douglas will have charge of the plant. The doctor says the system will be put in at once and will be in working order by the first of January. An eleotrio light plant ought to pay handsomely in Phillipsburg, tor if better and cheaper light can be fur nished the majority of our citizens will doubtless patronize it liberally. As the energy and enterprise of our city add new improvements and oonven ienoes, Phillipsburg becomes a better plaoe to live in. Let the good work go on.
