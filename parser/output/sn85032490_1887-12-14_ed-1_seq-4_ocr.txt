Cleveland has at least removed from his reach the temptation of voting for himself next year. He will have no vote. E. L. Ilarper, of the Fidelity bank in Cincinnati, gets ten years in prison. The important lesson to be learned in this case is that it is unsafe for bank presi dents in this country to inveest the inoney of their depositors in wheat comers. The coal famine is getting to be an in tolerable nuisance. Somebody is to blame for the suffering now caused by the scarcity of coal, and in the near future there will be a kick by the people which will convince some of the pools in this countrj- that there is a God in Israel. It was noticeable that in the vote for speaker at Waslungtoe an attempt was made to unite the Independent and Greenback votes upon a Greenback can didate. But General Weaver persist ently refused to leave the Democratic party, and cast ins vote with all his might for Carlisle. It is only a short time since Ed. Corri gan, of Kansas City, assaulted in a brutal manner Tom Hosier, a reporter of the Times. He lias now followed it up by an assault on Dr. Munford, the editor. Ed. Corrigan is a brute, and some day an item of news will go the rounds to the effect that Ed. Corrigan has been shot bv some of the Times force. Our Republican brethren may criticise and belittle tlie president's message as much as they please. It is nevertheless a document that will have gieat influence with tlie people. Osage City Free Pres. Xo doubt about it. Unless the Ameri can people have lost their spirit of self defense, which is one of the very first implanted in our nature, they will be infiuenced to repudiate his utterance, himself and the party which has the im pudence to back up such ab.-urdities. The senate seems to be talcing Mr. Cleveland's ukase on the tariff, that is, that portion of it in reference to the treasury surplus, seriouslj in hand. The amount of appropriations called for by bills introduced in one day, Monday, was nearly ight millions of dollars. At that rale, the question of the present surplus could bo settled by the holidays, and then the deck would be cleared for ac tion, as it were. It is said the hair of the dog is good for the bile. Upon this principlo the mugwumps will find a deal of comfort at the resignation of Eugene Iliggins, them as icceived such a cruel snub from the administration in the matter of his appointment. It is of little consequence to them whether his displacement was a voluntary act, as he claims, or was con strained: it will be enough for them to know that ho is down and out. Gail Ilamilton says there are thousands of women in the city of New York who want work and thousands of more in the country who want rest. She suggests that the two cliisses should be introduced to each other for the salvation of both. This would seem on first thought to be a good suggestion, but after mature de liberation, we are inclined to think it won't work. The women who want work in New York do not know how to do the work to be done in the countrv. Apropos of the special preparation making for the grand reunion at Gettys burg next July it was suggested that the Comple de Paris, the French volunteer aide to General Meade at that great bat tle should be in ited to deliver the ad dress of the occasion. That doughty old warrior and hero of I'ort Fisher and Big Bethel. Major General Benjamin F. Butler, objects to the innovation and now nothing remains for the -illustrious Frenchman but to sink into obscurity. Tho reason for the argus-eyed objector's opposition is accounted for by an eastern exchange in the fact that in the compte's narrative of the great battle (which is ad mitted to be a clever one) lie failed to distinguish our hero's military genius. The Leavenworth Sun, in speaking of the Eagle and its attitude towards sur rounding towns, simply don't know m hat it is talking about. Wo can't help the talk and wouldn't if wo could, of certain papers which refer to the Eagle as though it had said such and such things. The E.ygk has never fought any town in Kansas and seldom eer notices the ill natured flings of otner papers. Besides the Sun might do well to wait until it had outgrown its pinafore before offering advice or de livering opinions as to what does and what does not constitue journalism. So for as the Eagle and Wichita are con cerned they are asking no advice, and neither cares little what is said of them by papers of merely a circumscribed local circulation. Murders are of daily occurrence, and the trial of those charged with the crimes develop so great a diversity of at tendant circumstances that it is imiwssi. ble for the reading public to keep .up with them or bestow more than passing notice upon them. Now and then, how cer. a murder is committed wherein the atrocity of the crime is so great the at tention of everyone is arrested and inter est is centered in the case. Such has bot-n the famous Haddock case -in Sioux t ty, and it is hardly necessary to sav that the termination of the trial of Arensdorf in his acquittal of the charge of murder causes general disappoint ment. The verdict of the trial jury ex culpates him in the eyes of the law, but m the popular estimate the brand of Cain is still upon him and will remain; un less, perchance, it shall be proven here after that another is the guilty one. which is barely possible,

The national convention of Eepublican clubs, which meets in New York tomor row, while not charged with the respon sibility of formulating any rules for the government of the party, is yefc an im portant gathering in the interest of the party. Its work is purely auxiliary to the action of thp national nominating convention to be held in Chicago in June, but is little less important to the suc cessful issue of the campaign, inasmuch as the details thereof in the matter of a more thorough organization of the party from the beginning. We think the movement a wise one and the beneficial effects upon the outcome of the cam paign cannot fail to be manifest. OUR NAVAL ESTABLISHMENT. Secretary Whitney felicitates the coun try that owing to the foresight and wis dom of the head of the naval bureau, there have been initiated during the year three new manufactories, necessary to the construction and armament of a modern war vessel, viz. : That of steel forgings for heavy guns, that of armor for iron-clad vessels, and tliat of the sec ondary batteries (machine and rapid fire gun). This sounds well, and is indeed gratifying. But it is well known that nothing but government encouragement has been lacking for these many years for the establishment of such works, and that the Republican senate has repeated!' passed bills for the purpose widely the Democratic house has killed. Moreover, as to the rapid firing guns, Hartford has the Gathng and the Pratt & Whit ney plants, needing nothing but govern ment orders; and the" fact, discovered by the secretary, that owing to the superior ity of Hartford tools the Hotchkiss guns can be made there cheaper and better than the are made in Europe, warrants the belief that nothing but government support has been needed for the produc tion in this country of the best machine guns in the world. The lesson which Mr. Whitney's year's experience should teach him as a Demo cratic statesman is that it pays to encour age American enterprises. Corollary If the merchant marine of this country is to be revived, the work must be helped by the government, as is the case in other countries, especially in England. Mr. Whitney has the good fortune, which no Republican secretary of the navy for many years has enjoyed, of having all the money he asks for and great liberty to exercise his own judg ment in the building of a new navy. All the unarmored vessels authorized by congress are now in process of construc tion, and within two years they will all be completed. Moreover, lie has in the works two great armored ships, each to cost $2,.00,000. one built on plans of the naval bureau and one on plans for which the secretary lias paid $15,000 to an English ship-building firm. The secre tary also has $2,000,000 to expend in coast and harbor defense work, and has two torpedo boats in the work. SENATOR INGALLS' NOVEL. From a Washington Dispatch. A eloe friend of Senator Ingalls says that his novel will not be leady for pub lication for some time to come. Ho has, however, the plans of it mapped out, and he has been prepaiing it for years. The scene will, it is said, lie laid partly in Washington and partly in the west, 'and the character will be" the well known men and women of the epoch under as sumed names. The period will extend from the sitting of the electoral commis sion in lSiO and lbT7 to the culmina tion of the Gai field tragedy. It will be diversified with description, nar ration and incidents of adventures and it will contain the matured results of In galls' observations of the men and women, the manners and the morals, the passions and the tendencies of modern politics and of modern society. It will deal with conditions of success and fail ure in public life, but it will attempt to teach no distinctive moral or didactic lesson. Senator Ingalls is a very ready writer, and his vocabulary is a mixture of Carlisle. Addison and the best of the classics, interspersed with the character istic phrases of western life. He thinks by steam, and his brain works like a wheel of dynamo, striking off intellect ual sparks at even turn. He gives vou a new idea with everv word, and everv one tells. His sentences are a series of surprises. He delights in the pyrotech nics of languages, and he has a" greater power of invective than had John Ran dolph, of Roanoke, His head is shaped like that of Randolph, and he has many of the attributes of that eccentric states man of the past. He, however, is better balanced and more brainy, ami his cul ture is superior to that of the famed de scendant of Pocahontas. Ingalls has no sympathy for Sunday school statesmen, and his theory of jKihtics, though he may not have confessed it to himself, is that it is a battle of the ivirties which should be waged to the knife. CHANGED HIS MIND. Globe-Domocrat. The Chicago Tribune, in its apostasy, seeks refuge behind the official utter ances of the late President Arthur and his secretory of the treasury. Judge Folgt-r. Pray when did the Tribune ac cept Mr. Arthur as a political authoritv": During the presidency of that emi nent and upright man nothing was too harsh or too brutal for the Tribune to say of him. It practically accused him of the murder of Garfield, and constantly referred to him as "the Acting Provident"' "the Acci dental president." etc. It rejoiced over the defeat of Folger for governor of New York a result brought about by the basest treachery, done at the bidding of the very men who are now howling uiemseives noarse aoout inemugwumj. Arthur was a Republican, and the Trib une's efforts to make him appear a free trader are feeble in the extreme. If the Republican party had done its duty to tne people in Ib4. C Jiester A. Arthur would have been its candidate for nr'si- 1 dent that year. I THE 

QUESTION AT ISSUE. Protection, free trade, and surplus are so mixed in newspaper controversies, that the average reader is mixed in try ing to find out what the various dis putants really mean. Not'a few people give it up in dispair and conclude that the intricacies of internal customs, taxa tion and tariff for revenue, or for pro tection are past finding out. They con clude that thes questions are to be understood by statesmen alone. -There are few people who can not understand the workings of our system of national taxation In a very limited amount of study of the subject. What is called internal rev enue taxes is a tax levied on home pro ducts or industries. For instance, a tax is levied on tobacco, distilled liquors and oleomargarine. Ifthere be a tax of 2 cents per pound put upon oleomargarine the manufacturer of the article must pay that to the government. This 2 cents per pound is added to the cost. The manufacturer pays the government the 2 cents; the wholesale merchant pays it back to the manufacturer and the retail merchant pays it to the wholesale merchant; the retail merchant charges the extra 2 cents per pound to the man who buys the oleomargarine to eat. And, as the man who buys the ole margarine can not slide the 2 cents along to someone else, he is the one "who pays the government tax on oleomargarine, What is true of the oleomargarine in this respect is also true of the internal revenue tax levied on tobacco and whisky. The people who chew smoke the tobacco and drink Avhisky, wine and beer pay the ernment tax. This is a tax and the gov- on consumers and cannot be said in any way to protect American labor. A tar iff tax, or that collected from foreign imports, is a tax levied upon goods man ufactured in foreign countries when they are shipped into this country for sale. There is also in certain cases a tariff tax levied on raw material; for instance, there is a tariff tax levied on foreign wool shinned into this countrv. In the matter of tariff taxes the amount of such tax paid to the government is added to the cost of the article and the con sumer pays the tariff as" in the case of internal tax on tobacco and oleomargerine. It is estimated that rev enue received by otir government fiom tariff and internal taxes will meet all legal expenses of government; pay all dues of government, and by June next will leave in the -treasury one hundred and thirteen million of dollars. This is called the surplus. The vast amount of surplus remaining in the treasury is just so much money taken ironi the business of the country. Taken as it is from the legitimate chan nels of trade, thereby diminishing the circulating medium of the country, its depressing effects are felt in all the vari ous business interests in our land. That taxation should be limited to tho necessi ties of the government is a matter about which there should be no dispute. That the present surplus should be reduced is concealed by everyone having the inter est of his country at hearty But the question of how to reduce the surplus is the one great question now engaging the attention of statesmen. The president recommends that the in ternal revenue tax be retained on tobacco spirituous liquors, and that the tariff be reduced on foreign manufactured goods. The Democrats claim that tariff taxes cost the people main times more than the amount of such taxes received by government, because the home manu facturers, on account of these import duties, are allowed to sell their goods that much higher. For this reason the Democratic party are in favor of retain ing the internal revenue tax and cutting down import duties on foreign manufactured goods and on foreign wool. The Republicans are in favor of a reduction of internal revenue taxes, and the retention of the tariff on foreign manufactured goods for the very nurnose of enabling the home manufac turer to sell his wares just that much higher. The Republican party believe by so'do ing they will protect the American laborer to the amount of tho lax col lected on foreign imports. This is what Republicans mean when they resolve in favor of protective tariff. We willl illustrate this more ful ly. Wo now have a paper knife in our possession made in Bothlehem from a sea shell. Col. Stew art saj's the men employed in the indus try get twenty cents for a day's work. Now suppose these things could be brought to this country and sold for forty cents each, but an American, in order to pay the wages which our workmen re ceive, would have to sell his knives for sixty cents, the Republican party would say levy a tariff of twenty cents on the for eign article in order to protect Ameriqan labor. The Democratic party of tariff for revenues only would say we are not in favor of protective tariff, and if the Americans cannot make these knives for forty cents, they can work at some thing else. The principle involved in this one transaction is identically the same prin cipal that is involved in tins whole tariff discussion. The question for every citi zen of these United States to determ ine in his own mind is whether his country will be more benefitted by buying their wares from these pauper laborers in Europe at a less price, or of prosperous, well paid American laborers at a greater price. If cheap labor means prosperity, tho Democratic xirty is right. If well aid labor means prosperity, the Republican party is right.

From the Boston Journal. In a readable letter published in the Journal from Z. A. S. upon Kansas invest ments there was one paragraph which has given offence to the good people of Wichi ta. The paragraph read as follows: "Thero Is another class of loans not so good tho-e on propert y in towns which have been boomed. This craze has reached Its climax, and is now at a fctands-tlll. In some of the cities, which it is not necessary to name, large amounts of property are mortgaged for more than it will brinir now, and propably more than it will ever bring. There must be loss here, but the prudent have taken care of themselves. One investment companv already h.13 $12,(XXJ of unpaid lnteret coupons of Wichita loans. The development of that town is so remarkablo.even in this country of marvel, that it fc called the 'Windy Wonder.' It is going ahead,now with full head of steam. Its people hae secured enterprises by pure hasimrthem. Conservative men seem to catch t he spl 1 i t of reckless speculatlon,and go In when they reach Wichita," Mr. Frank K. Gillespie, corresponding secretary of the board of trade of Wichita, writes us at great length, taking excep tions to the statement, and furnishing from several loan companies evidence tljat the payment of interest is promptly made. There has certainly been no default to our knowledge upon eastern loans made in Wichita. Jlr. Gillespi writes: "Interest rates are from 6 to 8 per cent, per annum, and Z. A. S. says not over 40 per cent, of the values are loaned on prop erty. Taking the rate at S per cent., the interest being payable semi-annually. $120, 000 represents the interest on $3,000,000 on property assessed at $8,000,000. You will please bear in mind that there are five or six loan companies in the city, any one of which does an equal amount of business Avitli the others, and five or six others which do a good business. They all lend upon farming and city property. Taking Z. A. S.'s figures for one company, there should be .518,000,000 to $30,000,000 of money loaned on property assessed at 8,000,000, which you "can see is not common sense. Recognizing the influence your journal would have upon the moneyed men of your city and New England, who are not in a position to understand the animus anil the lalsiry ot such statements and the injury it might, if undisputed, do to not only your city, but to the scores of Boston "capitalists who have thousands of dollar-, loaned and invested in Wichita, I have taken occasion to make diligent in quiry among the loan companies and send you herewith some of the letters received ironi them, and which show that in the city of Wichita, and Sedgwick county in particular, and western Kansas in general the interest coupons are met with alacrity. I will say, that a matter of fact, Wichita has in the last six months acquired and is either operating or completing no less than forty-eight separate and distinct manu facturing establishments, representing a capital of S3,WJ2.000 and employment for .",312 people. Enough others are either being organized or seeking locations here tp make a total of 83 manufacturing concerns, with a total capital of 6,o03, 000, employing 11,542 people, which are promised Wichita before the first of June, 1SSS. Principal among these are the Bur ton Car works, which will be completed March 1, 1SSS, by Boston capitalists and employ 2,000 men; several packing houses, one with a daily capacity of 4,000 hogs, em -lt. !-- fif fn TiVl iiDn -n-iHi n rrltlliilif ploying 500 to GOO men, with a probability "' i.TWuuS-.i.m nf A", cminilv .-)?' l.-ir"Ht n wntflh fur-- torv emnloving 400"men, and, if I cared to tax your patience, I could fill a column with enumerations of the factories, the 2,000 buildings erected from June, 1SSG, to June, 1&S7, at a cost of 0,000.000, of the .$10,000,000 put into permanent improve ments, of the mile of business house front age built, ot the nine colleges and univer sities, and a thousand and one other things done here in one year. I have only this to say: Wichita is to day upon a firmer basis than ever before: investors feel far more secuie than even last winter, as she now has every certainty of becoming a large city. There is now" acting in rapidly an ac tivitv in real estate, which piomises to cnual, if not surpass, anything seen here during last winter and spring, when thous ands ot dollars were made by every person who invested, and not a man lo-jt his money. Her indebtedness is less only $90,000 and her taxes lower that anv other Kansas town, being 2.7:3 on each $100 of assessed valuation." We have no reason to question the ac curacy of the above statements, and they are gratifying to New England, for many of its active citizens hail from this section and are actively engaged in making Wichita a solid, progressive city. KANSAS "pUBLIcTlANDS. Chicago Tribune, Kansas will be one of the heaviest suf- fereis by the decision of Lamar overrul ing Sparks and allowing railroads indem nity tor lands reserved by the govern ment or disposed of before the date of the granting act. The grant of oneioad the Atchison. Topeka & Santa Fe em braces in that state, as'the land grabbers claim, the following tracts previously sold, reserved or otherwise disposed of, but for which indemnity is now to be wrongfully allowed: Kickapoo Reservation GO 03 Delaware Reservation 109.2JXJ 7o Pottawatomie Reservation 'Jl,:tt3 7b Sac and Fox Reservation 105,043 O.j Kansas Reservation 13,134 3 Kaw TIalf-brecd (estimated).... 4,707 42 Osage (trust) 31,140 IT, Fort Larned Reservation o,U31 50 Patented to Kansas Pacific Rail way Co 2,070 S5 Patented to C. B. U. P. Railway Co 109 03 Patented to M. K. & T. Railway Co 23,442 05 State selections, entries, home steads, etc., prior to date of grant 404.2SS 22 Total S09.749 70 Under what pretext is indemnity to be allowed for this imperial domain and the lands passed over t the railroads instead of being held for settlers? The language of the act making the grants to the Kan sas roads provided in terms plain beyond the need of anv interpretation: 'That anv and all lands heretofore re served to the United States by any act cl oy I of coneress or in anv other manner competent authority- for the purjose of aiding in any object of internal improve ment or for "any other purpose whatso ever, be and the same are hereby reserv ed from the operation of this act." The lands specified above had been dis posed of at the tune the grant to the road was made. Some tracts were held for the occupancy of the Indians, others had been granted to railroads previously constructed, and still others had been disposed of as entries, state selections. homesteads, etc. The United States could i not grant to the railroads lands which were already disposed of and which the government did not own. How, then, can it allow "indemnity' for such lands; "Indemnity' means to make good or reimburse for a loss, and yet Lamar is determined to indemnify the railroads for lands that could not have been in cluded in its grant, aud which it could not possibly have lost. Millions of acres are to lie turned over to the railroad land grant ring under this Ul-disguised scheme of land robl-ery. "What pretext is there for this scandalous spoliation of the public domain? None can be extorted from Lamar or any other official of the administration. Some years ago the state of Kansas ap jointed Mr. S. J. Crawford an agent to secure the adjustment of the Kansas railroad land grants and to prevent in demnity being allowed for the tracts df-cribed above. The stand taken by the state of Kansas was irfeeiiy just ami i)roir. and the attempt mad to rescue the lands should liave ben sec onded and approved bv the land office and the department of the interior, j Sparks made no effort so to do, but he was ousted from office and his decision 1 reversed. Lamar holds that th millions j of acres unlawfully gobbled by the rail- j roads under the indemnity trick must be I returned. Since the removal of Sparks and the reversal of his decision, Mr. Crawford, as agent for the state of Kan sas, has nothing to do but resign his commission or suspend further effort until another administration comes into power. The settlers in Kansas should understand that Mr. Lamar is to go on the supreme bench, and owins; to the close division in the senate it may be difficult to secure the confirmation as a justice of the supreme court of an ex confederate who once broke his oath to support the constitution of the United States. Votes are urgently needed, and it may yet be learned that the railroad land grant attorneys in the senate have promised the confirmation of Lamar on condition that before leaving the interior department he would remove Sparks, re verse his decisions and turn over to the corporate land grabbers millions of acres J of public land unlawfully seized.' SOME OP THE SURPLUS. Lawrence Daily Journal. Senator Plumb is reported to be pre paring a bill, on the line of the recom mendation of Postmaster General Vilas, which will dispose of some of the trouble some surplus in the treasury and its ex penditure confer both a present and per manent benefit on the country. His proposition is to greatly increase the number of public buildings. He pro poses that the smaller cities and larger towns of the country shall be allowed advantages no w denied them jthat the gov ernment shall buy suitable sites and erect structures suitable for postoflices and other federal uses. The provision that Senator Plumb has in mind Avill give ten or twelve more public buildings to Kan sas, as many more to Missouri, and prob ably twenty more "to Illinois. Every state Avill share, in the benefits of the measure in proportion to the number of smaller cities it has. In every town with a presitlential postoffiee, the government should own its own building, as well from a motive of economy as for the purpose of conducting the business of the department with convenience and security.
