I <5ht ^hfjhtrflstotmt Jtjislcr 1 fl L. Snyder, Editor and Publisher,, < Shepherdstown, W. Vs. Thursday, - December 5th, 1918. 1 IT is announced that Secretary of < War Baker has cancelled $2,600.000,00C ' of war contracts since the armistice has ( ' been signed. This is an economy that , will be approved by the people, even it i it isn't so pleasing to the contractors. 1 i TWO South American countries i Chile and Peru, are talking very biggoty and threaten to go to war w'th each other. But there will be no war, for Uncle Sam has whispered to them that he is ready to spank either or both ol them if they don't behave. > AFTER having served faithfully and well as Fuel Administrator since the war began. Dr. H. A. Garfield has resigned his office and returned to his col iege work. If it had not been for tht wise regulations of Fuel Administrator Garfield we'd probably be paying twenty dollars a ton for coal right now. ALMOST every day now ships are coming into port with returning soldiers from England and France. Our men have covered themselves with glory and they deserve the welcome that awaits them here. An army of a million will be retained in France and Germany,-however, in order to guard against German treachery. and it will be a long time before all of our boys come back. THERE seems to be a general demand that William Hohenzollern shall be brought to trial for his crimes, and it is not unlikely that England sod France will have him extradited from Holland and arraigned at the bar of justice. Why shouldn't this wholesale murder be made to answer for his dreadful deeds, just as an ordinary criminal is required to pay the penalty' And von Tirpitz, the arch-fiend who is responsible for the submarine atrocities, is another beast who should have summary justice dealt to him. LAST Saturday night every brewery in the country had to stop making beer by order of the Food Administration. In all probability they will never again be allowed to resume operations, for the country doesn't like the Germans who have been running the business and it l-.as seen enough of the evil effcts of t'reir products to permanently stop the manufacture. What a tremendous task the prokibitionists have accomplished in this countrv MftUt frtP A /!??. n.A.I J I IVI a UI y WV1IU2 ? LAST Monday President Wilson appeared before Congress and read his message to that body. It was reported that certain Republicans would take advantage of the opportunity to crossquestion him about his proposed trip to Europe, but they got cold feet and there was no break in the deoorain of the occasion. The President stated that he was going abroad to take Dart in the peace proceedings because he conceived it his duty to do so, and unprejudiced persons, as a rule, will And no fault with him for going. Those who are prejudiced would have criticised him if he hadn't gone. IN his address to Congress on Mondav President Wilson said that he was not yet able to say what is the best way to handle the railroads. He is ready to release them from government control whenever a satisfactory plan of readjustment can be worked out, but he expressed the opinion that they would not be given back to private manage ment to be conducted under old conditions. For our part, we should like to see the government hold the railroads for the next five years at least?just to see what the result would be. We predict that there would be a tremendous improvement. 

YESTERDAY at a quarter past ten o'clock President Wilson set sail from New York on the transport George wasnington en route to Europe to par ticipate in the peace conference that wil be held in France. He was accompanied by two of the American representative' to the peace conference. Secretary ot State Lansing and Henry White, th two other representatives. Col. E. A' House and Gen, Tasker H. Bliss being already in Europe*. The President' i wife accompanied him, and in the party also are Ambassador to Great Britain John W. Davis and Mrs. Davis. Many experts in statecraft and diplomacy are with the President, and specialists in history and international politics. Of course there are many clerks and secret service men and helpers ofvarioussorts. May the winds blow softly and may the sea be calm while this precious 1 freight sails across the ocean, I "Liberty Fuel," a gasoline substitute ; which can be manufactured to sell at j two-fifths of the present cost of gas- , oline, will be on the market by the first i of the year. The War Department an- ? nounced Friday that the substitute had been produced by the research and t developent division of the department. * /? V"- *U~ ' 1 ula will be released to manufacturers ( probably under some agreement with the War Department as to the margin of profit that will be allowed. The product, which has kerosene for a base. , is described as odorless, colorless and noncorrosive, and tests have proved it to develop a thermal efflciensv greatei f than the best gasoline. It 1* said that > Capt. T. C. Weisgarber, a gas and oil I engineer connected with the department e who is responsible for the discovery, c will be placed in charge of its distribu- r tion. 1 J The guaranteed price for the 1916 * wheat, fixed at $226 a bushel, Chicago basis, will stand, even though the Level s act under which the price was fixe f should b-come inoperative through con- \ elusion of peace, in the opinion of thi f Food Administration. The Administra f tion issued a statement interpretin t (he Lever act and pointing out that the law provides that "all rights or liabilities under this act arising before its a termination shall continue and may be. ? enforced in the same manner as if the 1 act had not terminated." Wheat grow- * ers in many parts of the country, it was said, have been apprehensive'that the s guaranteed price for the 1919 crop o might be rescinded through conclusion o Of peace. . v A Notes of Our Soldiers.
