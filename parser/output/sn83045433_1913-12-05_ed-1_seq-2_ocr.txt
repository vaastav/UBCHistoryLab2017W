Establishment of an annual. Instead of a triennial assessment of real estate again U advocated by W. P. Richards, assessor for the District, In hit annual report made public jesterday. He also recommends to the Commissioners that an Increase In the Held force of the office be asked for, that the personal tax on automobiles be repealed, that an an nual license fee based on horsepower be levied on motor vehicles, and that per sonal property below the value ef Jl.OOO be exempt from taxation. The report shows a total assessment valuation of l333,JW,9Mv an Increase of nearly J9.0M.000 In the total assessed valuation of real eitate In the District over that of the preceding year.
