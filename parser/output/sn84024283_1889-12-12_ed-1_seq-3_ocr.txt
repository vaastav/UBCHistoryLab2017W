Did you ever make a calculation of the number of people that have inhab ited this globe since the beginning of time? No doubt you will say that such calculations involve a loss of time, and are, after all, barren of results, but as we are engaged in giving curious read ings and odd calculations, let us take a few minutes time and approximate, with a certain degree of accuracy, at least, the number of souls that have been ushered into and out of this sinful world since the time when it was not good for Adam to be alone. At the present time it is believed that there are 1,400,000,000 human beings on our globe; but let us suppose there has been but an average of 900,000,000 living at one time since the creation. To give room for any possible doubt as to the average length of life, we will put it down at 50 years.' (It may have been longer than that during Bible times, it has been much shorter, however, since). WTith the average length of life reck oned as above, wo have had two genera tions of 900,000,000 each every century for the past 6,000 years. Taking this for granted, we have had about 60,627, 843,237,075,260 inhabitants on this globe since the beginning of time. Admitting that there is a great aeai of guess-work about this calculation. and that it has been hastily and pet haps inaccurately done, it will be per ceived, nevertheless, that our-earth is a vast cemetery. On each rood of it 1,283 human beings have found a burial place. A rood being scarcely sufficient for ten graves, each grave must contain the remains of 129 persons. The whole surface of the globe, if all peoples bury within the earth as we do, has been dug over 120 times in order to get room foi burial places.--St. Louis Eepublic " Evil is talked of, but good is taken as a matter of course. r j -) OB (- From Shop to Mansion.

CHAPTER X. In the following weeks Isabel had need of 21 her firmness and presence of mind, for, as Dr. Conroy had said, there was a pro longed straggle for fife in the sick room ; the first week had been one of delirious raving, and her heart sank within her as she repeatedly heard him muttering: "She does not love me; she does not love me," in such sad tones that it pierced her very heart. She knew her own heart now fully; in those terrible nights of watching, when she had sat beside him, breathless with fear and suspense, the thought had come to her in all its chilling force of what life would be to her without him, and she knew that she loved him with a deep devotion which would last through eternity. She told him so again and again, as she knelt by his bedside, but he only looked at her with a blank stare, not comprehending or caring for the intelligence which would have made him so happy in health. She kissed his fevered face and bathed it in tears of contrition as she bemoaned the answer she had given him in that last moment of partial sanity, when he had asked her if she loved him. And yet, how could she have answered him differently, without being sure of her own feelings. Mrs. Montford had brought her skill and experience into the sick-room at once, scorn ing Dr. Conroy's proposition to install a A PAIR OF SOFT ARMS STOLE AROUND HER. hired nurse there, and had shared the young wife's vigil with unwearied devotion. Gracie wandered through the house dis consolately, and even Lottie's unvarying sweetness and care could not console her for the loss of her parents' society. A tele gram had been sent to Mrs. Stanford at the first, and as Isabel was sitting one day in the darkened chambers, her hands clasped over her face in deepest dejection, the door opened and a light step entered the room. A pair of soft arms stole around her neck, and a sweet voice whispered in her ear : "Dear auntie, as mamma was not well, I have come to help you nurse Uncle Harvey." It wa3 Lillian, and Isabel leaned her head wearily on the young bride's shoulder, and commenced the acquaintance with a burst of tears. Lillian had a rare fa culty in a sick-room; her steps were so noiseless, ana she was so far removed from fussiness, and with an excellent memory, she could always be depended on to carry out every direction of the physician. Isabel could rest, so far as her overwhelm ing anxiety would allow her to, with perfect confidence that Mrs. Montford and Lillian were doing all for him which could be done. The delirium had given way to a heavy stupor, and there must soon be a change for the better or worse, and the change was awaited with breathless interest. "Do not grieve so, dear auntie," said Lillian, gently, when Isabel, overcome by the thought that he might die, had given way to violent weeping. "Uncle Harvey has such a grand constitution, you know ; why, I am perfectly astonished at him for being sick at all, it is an unprecedented performance on his part, lean assure you." Her gentle raillery was better in this case than sympathy, and hope sprung up anew in the wife's heart, and she began to look forward more cheerfully to the expected turn in the disease. It was her night to watch with him, and she took her place by the bedside with a more hopeful spirit than she had cherished since he had been sick. About midnight she noticed that he breathed more naturally, and, going close to him, she noticed with a heart throbbing with delight that there was a faint sparkle of moisture on his hitherto parched and strained forehead; she took her handker chief and gently wiped it off, fearing she might be mistaken, but no, it was true, and in a few moments it reappeared and she knew he was better. "Oh, God, I thank Thee," she cried, as she sank upon her knees in mute thanksgiving. Perhaps the great emotion of her heart awoke a sympathetic chord in his, for in a few moments he opened his eyes, and, look ing at her with glad recognition, whispered, feebly: "Isabel." "My love! my darling 1" she whispered softly in his ear. He seemed to strugglo with memory. "You do love me, then," he whispered, faintly. 'Better than my life, aearest love," she said, gently pressing her lips to his. He smiled wearily, like a tired child, and with a look of ineffable content dropped oft to sleep again, while she sat by his side in a tumult of joy. "How is he?" said Mrs. Montford, who came in to relieve her watch. "He is better," she whispered. "He knows me and spoke to me." "Thank the Lord for His mercies I" said the good woman, fervently, and, taking Is abel in her arms as if she had been her own child, '-now go to bed, dearie, and sleep like a top until morning." The sun was high when the overtaxed wife awoke from her long and dreamless slumber; the slumber of sweet relief after long days and nights of weariness and ag onizing suspense, and she hurriedly dressed herself and went into the sick-room. Lillian was there, and her husband was awake. He greeted her with a smile, in fantile in its weakness, yet full of love and trust, as she bent.over him and whispered glad words of love and thankfulness iuto his car. "Have I, then, been so very sick?" he asked, feebly, as her tears of joy fell upon his face "I think, Uncle Harvey, you deserve a good scolding for giving us such a scare," Lillian answered for her. "If it hadn't been for my excellent nursing there's no know ing what would have happened to you. Aunt Isabel and that big-eyed doctor were glowering over you like a couple of lunatics when I came to the rescue." Ho was too weak to replv to her lively sallies, but he pressed his wife's hand with a feeble energy. It seemed as if she could not be demon strative enough after the long period of cold indecision through which she had passed ; she knew now that she had loved him for months when she had imagined herself grateful only, and she sighed as she thought how his kind and noble heart must have been wounded by her coldness, and she strove to make amends by showing him every phase of tenderness her full heart could devise. "Ithinklmust go home how," saidLil- "I have premature fate, and I shall have another to drag from the brink of despair if I do not get back to Ralph. Mamma says he wanders to and fro like the disconsolate ghost of Melan choly." "I little thought that your long-talked-of visit was to be such a doleful affair as this," said Isabel. "But, indeed, Lillian, yon do not know how much you have helped me." "I assure you I take full credit to myself for all I have done," she answered, willfully. "I do believe Uncle Harvey got up this lit tle diversion just for the purpose of testing the affection of his friends." "Then I deserved to be disappointed, didn't I!" he said, weakly. He enjoyed her bright raillery, as it showed him that he was once more among flesh and blood peo ple instead of the dim and ghostly forms among which he had moved during the weeks when his diseased fancy had distort ed every thing about him into unreal shapes. Isabel was not disappointed in Lillian ; the bright, sweet girl was just the gener ous, whole-souled little woman she had im agined her to be, and a warm affection had sprung up between them. 'You have forgiven me, then, for marry ing your uncle?" Isabel said, mischievously, as they were waiting in the drawing-room for the carriage which was to take Lillian away. j 'Yes," she replied, promptly, "and have given you my blessing, figuratively speak ing." Then more thoughtfully : "Your case is only another demonstration of the fact which mamma and I have argued over ever since I went in pinafores, that a person's position in life does not necessarily deter mine all his qualities of head and heart." 'Well, what do you think of her?" said Mrs. Stanford, after Lillian's return, and when other inquiries had been answered, "I think Uncle Harvey might have hunt ed the city over without finding any one so perfectly suited to him as Aunt Isabel," re plied Lillian, warmly. 'Even if she was a plebeian shop-girl," said Mr. Stanford, with a smile. "I'm afraid the blue blood of the Car ring- tons would boil if they should hear you speak of their kinswoman under that title," and Lillian laughed. "Aunt Isabel told me that Major Carrington was terribly shocked when she told him how she had been forced to earn a living." Harvey Falconer's return to health was as rapid as could be expected, considering his extreme weakness, and he was as yet but the pallid ghost of himself as he sat up in his easy chair, or laid upon the puffy cush ioned lounge in the home room. It was now long past Christmas and they had received an urgent invitation Irom Major Carrington to spend the remainder of the winter at Elm Park, and had deeid ed to go as soon as the invalid was strong enough to travel. Dr. Conroy had advised the change of climate, and Mr. Falconer. with his blood debilitated and chilled by sickness, looked forward to it gratefully. Dr. Conroy had been like a brother in this time of trouble, and the Falconers, who had respected and admired him before, were now bound to him by the ties of affection as well. He who comes to us in our hour of trouble not only makes himself our friend, but commands affection also, and the earnest, faithful physician not only heals the sickness by the aid of his skillful knowl edge, but brings his sympathy, his soothing word and kindly touch, winninga place for himself in our heart3 which no other can fill. Dr. Conroy was one of these who brought his heart with him to the sick chamber. Many a mother could testify that he had ministered to her sick babe as tenderly as if it had been his own. It was this element of tenderness in his nature which had endeared him to Lottie Fcrd, and with him affection for the fair, sweet girl, so gentle and un complaining in her suffering, had sprung up spontaneously, and he had made her but few visits before he became conscious that she was the one woman of all the world whom he wished to call his wife, and as he was a straightforward man, ho had lost no time in showing her his heart. She was steadily improving under his care, and could now walk with one crutch with but little pain, and there was every reason to hope that her recovery was to be complete, and she was preparing for the visit at homo with great delight. "Lottie, dear," said Isabel as they sat in her cheerful room, "you will spend the time with us before your marriage, will you not? We shall return in February, and I shall hope to see you soon after we come home." 'Yes," replied Lottie; "Malcolm wishes me to remain under treatment for some time yet. He is thinking he can get father better employment here than he has in New York. If it were not for that I should feel as if I must pass my last months of maiden life with mother." 'Oh, isn't that lovely 1" cried Isabel, "if you can have the little mother near you: she will have to adopt me, too, for I long for a mother so," and she gave a sigh for the lost mother in her grave. 'Mother's heart is large enough for us both," replied Lottie, smiiing, "and I only fear that I shall have occasion to be jealous of you. They will come in the spring, if all works as we expect, and - as Dr. Conroy is almost positive it will." "Then I fear I am to be disappointed in having the pleasure of making a darling lit tle wedding foj" you," said Isabel, a shade coming over her face. "I had anticipated having such a quite select affair." "Well," replied Lottie, "you and mother may decide that when the time comes, for 1 must confess that with father and mother here, your home would seem as much like my home as any placo could." "You darling," said Isabel, relieved. 'Then I shall coax our mother until she is MAJOR CARRIXOTOK MET THE TRAVELERS. obliged to consent to be rid of me ; of course you will go to housekeeping at once." ' Xes, Dr. Conroy is so thoroughly tired of boarding, though upon what scale I am sure I know not; I have never questioned him." " Not a pinched one, my dear," said Isa bel, nodding her head knowingly. 'The doc tor is far from being a poor man." I am glad of that," said Lottie, sweetly. "I had feared so much that I might be a hindrance to him, if he was yet poor, and struggling for success, but if he can afford such an expensive luxury as a weakly wife is liable to be, I shall feel better satisfied, for of course it would be folly for me to ex pect to be as strong as many are." 'Yes, my little friend, you might as well decide that you are never going to bear the world on those slender shoulders of yours, and save yourself some inevitable disap pointment; but you have a mission of sweetness and patience, which no one but vou can accomplish, and which tho most of us would fail in. So be comforted, my dear ; ! it seems to be one of the compensations of , life that the weakness of the flesh adds; strength and grace to the spirit." i Major Carrington met the travelers at the station when they alighted, and wel- corned them with warm Southern hospital lian, playfully, the next day. cued one forlorn man from even of prepared-to W-pien.ii A roomy traveling for them, and the burty looked curiously, yet respeetf as she came forward, for t: spread among the older coloi "Missy Alicia's" long-lost da' commg, and this faithful fellow hvi JJet reck uu luo ever sinro uo was uviu, ueiuijittle that is bus war oa a Biavc, biuvo us buucuiui ant. - - . A ride of a few miles through lovely scenery brought them to the natural park ot elms, from which the place was named. Elm Park, the carriage winding through them, past a miniature lake, and bank after bank of roses and other flowers, which, though not in bloom, were yet green and suggestive of their summer beauties. The house was a fine specimen of a Southern home, wide verandas on all sides, support ed by heavy pillars, around which twined wide-spreading branches of the lovely Bal timore Belle, Marechal Niel rose and clus tering clematis. " My dear girl, welcome, thrice welcome to our home," said Mrs. Carrington, a tall, stately lady, who came out upon the veran da to meet them, taking her in a warm embrace. " And here is Caroline, waiting to wel come ber cousin," said the Major, as a tall, graceful girl, -and the image of her mother. came to the door of the hall, while Mrs. Carrington gracefully welcomed Mr. Fal coner and Gracie. Caroline grasped Isa bel's hand with cousinly warmth, and then introduced her to Adelaide, her sister, also tall and graceful, but with more of the Car rington style of features. Isabel could scarcely control her emotions as she entered the house, though she could not have analyzed her feelings, but Mrs. Carringtoti coming in was quick to observe and assigu a reason for her agitation, and kindly led her to a small sitting room oft the hall, and, summoning a portly colored woman, she gave directions that the guests should be taken at once to the rooms they were to occupy. "Dinner will be served in about an hour, if that will give you time to rest," said tho Major, as they were ascending the stairs. "Plenty of time," replied Mr. Falconer. "A bath and a five minutes nap will render me, at least, capable of doing full justice to your hospitality." "My darling I" said Mr. Falconer, tender ly, as Dinah, after stirring the fire in the grate, which was, at this season of the year, necessary even in the sunny South, and showing Isabel where to find clqthes press and bath rooms, at last disappeared. He saw that she was on the verge of tears, and drew her to his arms. 'I am so strangely happy," she said, as she leaned her head upon his sheltering breast and burst into tears of excitement 'It is a wonderful experience for you," he said, smoothing her hair gently, as he removed her hat, "and you have need of all your fortitude to take you through it with out over-taxing your nerves." She was trembling even now like a leaf. "How selfish I am," she said, after she had become more calm. "I forgot in my own thoughts how weak you are still," for he was trembling, too, in his sympathy for her. "Forgive me, dear," and she in her turn became the comforter, and forced him to lie down upon an easy couch, while she opened trunks, and made preparations for the toilet. They were large, airy rooms which had been given them, the windows opening out upon a delightful prospect, with distant Richmond just appearing in view. " Oh, how funny," said Gracie, who had been exploring the bedrooms and looking from the windows. "There's just ever so many little bits of houses out this way; does Major Carrington have tenement houses to rent?" "Yes, my dear," replied her father smiling at her natural mistake ; " but the tenants are his own working-people these colored people you saw about the place who, with their families, occupy these houses." Meanwhile a discussion was going on be low. "She's pure Carrington, isn't she?" said Caroline, as she languidly dropped into a chair. " The very image of Chester," said Mrs. Carrington. Her eyes and hair will remind you of Alicia when you see her again," remarked the Major. "By the way, where is Ches ter?" a "He is having one of his gloomy fits to day," answered his wife, "and though I told him his daughter was coming, it seemed to make no impression upon his mind, and he has wandered off." He isn't alone?" said the Major, a little anxiously. Oh, no. I sent Pompey after him as usual, and he will take care of him." I wonder Mrs. Pembroke is not here," said Adelaide, looking from the window. I fear meeting so many of us at once is going to be very exciting for Cousin Isabel. 1 noticed her hand trembled in mine when I took it." She is not looking as well as when I saw her," said Major Carrington. "Her hus band's sickness has, doubtless, been a strain upon her nerves." "Mamma, oughtn't we to send Lizett and Cato to help them dress?" I hardly know what they have been ao. customed to," replied Mrs. Carrington. People live so differently in the North and South." " I think, my dear," laughed the Major, that my niece would consider a dressing- maid a nuisance." Well, 1 am sure if I were obliged to comb my own hair, I should soon decide to wear it cropped close," said Adelaide, laughingly, giving her fine head, adorn6d with heavy braids, a toss. Still, if you had always been accus tomed to being your own hair-dresser," re- marked Caroline. Habits are inexorable things," said Mrs. Carrington, "and, for the present,! will send Lkette to inquire if Mrs. Fal- coner would like her assistance in dress ing." A neat colored girl made her appearance in answer to the bell, and Mrs. Carrington gave her her directions. Pears like dem Northern ladles ain't fust qual'ty no how," was Lizette's dis satisfied comment as she descended the stairs, after Isabel had kindly declined her services at her toilet. She had never been accustomed to such assistance, and looked upon it as more of a hindrance than a help, except in exceptional cases. "But, den, I spec's it all in de brungin' up," she con cluded, philosophically. A carriage was at the door as Lizette reached the hall, and Major Carrington was handing out an old lady with tender re spect. It was Mrs. Pembroke, and she Bald eagerly as she took his offered arm : "Has she come?" to be continued. In the town of South Addison, Me., to sides a man about thirty years old, who.

It is the l(X&he State Department to ihe body' he message and contains important or instructive. It is seldom that' an Executive in a gen eral message departs from recognized routine. Lincoln did it when the men ace of rebellion was upon us. Cleveland did it when he wished strongly to emphasize his conviction that the para mount need of the country was tariff re form. But, pursuing the old lines, President Harrif.on opens with a couple or columns descriptive of the status of our affairs with foreign lands, in all of which, since we are at peace with the world, there is little of genuine interest. J; or the rest the message, save as the President s view has been changed by recent elections and by Department re ports, is a restatement of his letter of acceptance and his speech on the 4th of March last af tetaking the oath of oflttce. a he obligations of his office make him more solicitous about the evil effects of a Treasury surplus than when he was a candidate. The surplus for the last year was in round numbers 657,000,000. The estimated surplus for the next year is 543,000,000. As a matter of fact this may be falsified, and it is altogether likely that it will, for when Con gress will have made its appropri ations it is not likely that the show ing will be quite so rosy. Tne President speaks upon this question as it he were Cleveland himself, save that his rec ommendations are not so logical. He would have the internal tax on tobacco removed. He would have the free list of the custom-houses enlarged. He would have the tariff revised; but he would have the protective feature re tained in revising the schedules upon all articles of domestic manufacture, and is particularly solicitous upon paper that farm products shall come in for a share of protection. Just how this can be done he doesn't stop to say. The farmers of lowa recently considered the subject, and concluded with eminent practicabil ity that it wasn't in the power of Con gress to do it. The farmer can be re lieved at the custom-house by a reduc tion of taxation. He can not be bene fited in any other way. Passing from the report of the Secre tary of the Treasury the President treats of a variety of subjects in a perfunctory way. He wants the law for the exclu sion of Chinese rendered more efficient. lie wants coast defenses improved and discriminating appropriations made for rivers and harbors. He recommends legislation for intermediary Federal courts, increased payment of district judges and greater protection for Fed eral judges and witnesses summoned thereto. A small paragraph against trusts is followed by a recommendation that an international copyright law be passed, that a National bankrupt law be enacted and that the naturalization laws be so amended as to guard against ad mitting to the privileges of citizenship aliens who c.an not be trusted. Upon departmental questions the President follows the information and adopts the recommendation of the chief. lie notices that the pension roll in volves at remendous expenditure, but he asks for more upon the suggestion that there are numerous dependent veterans who ought to be provided for out of the National exchequer. Regarding the inter-State commerce law the one recom mendation, humane enough, is that com mon carriers be required to look special ly to the safety of their employes, es pecially brakemen and yardmen. Con cerning the District of Columbia it is asserted that "the laws regulating the sale of intoxicating drinks should be re vised with a view to bringing the traffic under stingent limitations and control," which will be taken by jesters as a sly thrust at our amiable Vice-President, mine host of the Shoreham, and its at tractive buffet. While recommending the World's Fair he prudently refrains, of course, from naming a particular city. The negro and the civil service are taken care of in the usual method. The message, having recommended subsidies for ocean mail service between our ports and South and Central America, closes with a suggestion which was not needed that Congress mustn't mistake cheese paring for economy. hen Congress will have voted large additional sums for pensions, for education, for coast defense, for naval increase, for subsi dies, there will be no further need for the President's solicitude about the sur plus. That will disappear as totally as the lost tribes of Israel and the embar rassment will not be, as in Cleveland's day, to find means of reducing the rev enue, but to devise ways of increasing taxation.

LABOR AND PROTECTION. Mr. Powderly Has at Last Arrived at the Right Conclusion. Powderly says that the wage-earners are not protected, but that the manu facturer is; that the rich man gets rich er under that policy, while the poor man is constantly getting poorer. Well, it has taken Mr. Powderly a long time to get there, but we congratulate him on his aarival. The nobility of Europe spurn the notion that they and the middle classes are made out of the same kind of clay. They are special creations, while the multitude are made by wholesale and dumped on the earth by the million. So the men who are making fortunes by protection have a theory that govern ment and laws should look after their interests and let the working-men shift for themselves. What is the consequence? Let the Knights of Labor answer the question. It is just this: That an employer like Mr. Carnegie is willing to give a fair wage when he can take $1,000 a day out of his concern, but when he feels poor and can only extract 500 a ay from his business he deducts 10 per cent, from the wages of his working-men. Who is protected? Well, Mr. Carnegie and "the likes of him" are protected with a vengeance. Every thing is on their side the Administration, the Re publican party and Congress; but on the side of the poor man, what? Starva tion and all he can stand of it. His only resource is a strike. In his desperation at manifest injustice he disregards .law and order, gets up a riot, is arrested and sent to prison. That is all the protection he gets, and it is about time for the Knights of Labor to borrow Powderly's spectacles and see this tiling just as it is. N. Y. Herald.

The Democratic platform affirmed: We give our hearty support to the petition of the present Republican Governor of this State and other leading Iron and steel manufacturers of both political parties addressed to the New England members of Congress asking for free coal and iron ore and lower duties upon pig iron, and we commend their efforts to save this important industry threatened with extinction in our section of the country through failure to adopt tariff duties to the changed conditions of the iron market. ' The Republican platform was less ex plicit in language, but was as distinct a recognition of the weight of the peti tion, declaring: To our Senators and Representatives in Con gress we would say that the Republicans of Massachusetts look to them to defend a sound currency and resist an increase of the present silver coinage; to use every exertion to bring about a reduction of the surplus revenue; to support a thorough and equitable revision Of the tariff, so as to adapt the prot ection which it affords to changed business conditions, af fecting New England industries in common with those of the rest of the country, etc. The movement, thus started by the iron and steel manufacturers, has now been taken up by the woolen manufact urers of New England and New York, and petitions are in circulation request ing Congress either to reduce or repeal the taxes on wool. The Wool Reporter, of Boston, and the Dry-Goods Econo mist, of New York, two representative trade journals, have already enlisted in the movement. Among those who favor the movement in this State are the Can astota knitting mills, the Saxony wool en mills, of JNewburgh, the Kanota woolen mills, of Middleville, the Pulaski woolen mills, Rochester knitting mills, and a long list of manufacturing estab lishments in Massachusetts, Rhode Isl and and New Hampshire. The recent elections are by no means the strongest indication of the growth of public sentiment in favor of tariff re duction. The National administration will find itself, in a very short time, face to face with that "condition" of which its members made merry on the stump barely a year ago, and its theories about "protection" will fall on heedless ears if they are again put forth in the President's message, the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, or the speeches of party leaders in Congress.

If there is anything that ought tc go on the free list, it is salt and lumber, which are so largely used by the agri cultural classes, and iron ore and coal. which are used by the manufacturing classes. The two former would greatly benefit the agricultural sections of the West; the two latter would greatly ben efit the manufacturing interests of the New England States and, indeed, our whole seaboard.- -American Dairyman.

Vanqaets Don't Make Trade. John T. Abbott, the American Minis ter at Bogota, writes to the State De partment: The Colombian may admire the institutions of the "great republic," as he calls it, but he is not for that reason willing to pay a friend, how. ever de ar to him, four cents a yard for cotton cloth which he can buy of some one else for two and one-half cents. It will require something more than sentiment to change the volume of trade. Here's the situation in a nutshell. We can not sell our manufactured products in Latin-America, in successful compe tition with those of Europe, until we can sell them as cheaply. This we can never do so long as our manufacturers are handicapped by heavy taxes on their raw materials, machinery, etc. All the banquets we can give to the "pan-Amer icans," and all the fine speeches we can make to them, and all the subsidies we may vote to steamship lines, will not induce the people of Central and South America to buy in a dear market, when cheap markets are open to them. In dianapolis Sentinel. A Message for Plunderers. Mr. Harrison's message is not a sur prise, nor will it be a disappointment. It furnishes the respectable veneering of piety, patriotism and plausibility for schemes that aim at the extension of privilege, the oppression of the poor and the corruption of free government. Having received the word, we may now look for such a furor of waste, of plunder and of violence as the country has not seen ' since the second term of Grant. Let the Democratic minority, more powerful in its imperishable principles than in its numbers, set itself resolutely to the task of resisting these fresh en croachments upon the rights of man kind.

Jars concealed are half reconciled; while 'tis a double task to stop the breach at home - and men's mouths abroad. To this end a good husband never publicly reproves his wife. An open reproof puts her to do penance be- many study revenge rather than re formation. Fuller. . In our pursuit of things in this world we usually prevent enjoyment by ex pectation; we anticipate our own hap piness and eat out the heart and sweet ness of worldly pleasures, by delightful forethoughts of them, so that when we. come to possess them they do not answer the expectation nor satisfy the desires which we raised about them, and they, vanish into nothing. it is, pernaps, natural to wish for the better times which, we have reason to believe, are to come hereafter, though if one can not be happy among the bless ings the world now affords him, it is dif ficult to imagine what would satisfy him. As for those good old times, they are getting to be pretty well discredited, even by those who believe that in cer tain particulars the former days were better than these. United Presbyterian
