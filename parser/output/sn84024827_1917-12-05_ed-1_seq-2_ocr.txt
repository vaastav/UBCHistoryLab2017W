Many of these men ha.e been under surveillance by department of jf justice agents for months, but have not been taken Into custody because of lack of definite evidence against them. When congress adopts Persident Wilson's recommendation that a state of war against Austria-Hungary be declared, unaturalized subjects of the dual monarchy automatically will be come enemy aliens and be subject to arrest and interment. For several months government agents have been gathering informa tion on the hostile activities of Au- strians who were not subject to the i restrictions imposed on unnaturalized Germans by the state of war with Ger j amny. ' Government investigators recently j reported an exodus . of educated Au Btrians from the United States and it is believed they fled in an:icipation of I a formal declaration of war agaiiutt ; their country. An.'jng them were j known to be men who had been con j nected with hostile interests. Con sequently a declaration of war at im ; time would be too late to permit the i apprehension of some 'of the most dan I gerous leaders of the enemy esnoin I age system. j Nearly a million Austrian subjects i in the United States would be af : fected by a declaration of war, for they would- immediately become amen- aDle to the resident's order requiring j enemy 'aliens? to register, forbidding them to travel without special permit water ti'jnts. warehouses and terminals.

Austro-Hungarlans in this country are .harmless and a great proportion, paric-i ularly of Hungarians, Bohemians and i Slavic elements are actually pro-ally. ConsequenUy carefnl consideration will be shown in administering the enemy alien regulat.'jns. Department of JusJce officials weu pleased today over the president recommendation for legislation to ex tend enemy alien restrictions to t men, some of who mare suspected i being clever aids to the German es poinage system.
