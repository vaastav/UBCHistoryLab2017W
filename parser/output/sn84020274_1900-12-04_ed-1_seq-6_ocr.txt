Many of these pos.s are along our frontier, or at Important strategic points, the e-cupation of which is necessary. We hae In Cuba between 3.0 and flsO troops.

It must be apparent that we will require an army of about CO.('Ji). and that during present conditions In Cuba and the Philip pines the President should have authority lo increase the force to the present number of 10.wo.

In this number authority should he given to raise native troops In the Philippines up to U.O'O. which the Tuft commission believe will be more effective in delecting and suppressing guerrillas, assas sins and ladrones than our own soldiers. The full dIscus'on of this subject by the Secretary of War in his annual report is called to jour tamest attention. I renew the recommendation made In my last annual message that the Congress pio vide a special medal of honor for the vol utin ers, regulars. sailors and marines on duty in the Philippines ho voluntarily re mained in the service after their terms of enll'tment had expired. I favor the recommendation of the Secre tary of War for the detail of officers trnm the line of the army when vacancies occur In the Adjutant Gfperai's Department. In spector General's Department.

RURAL FREE DELIVERY. The continued and rapid growth or the postal service Ii a sure Index of the great and increasing business activity of the country.

"If Nlearigua con cludes a troaty with Great llrltatn. which will not deal fairly v. lib tint I'lilted State.-" In tins matter of the Nicaragua Canal, this Governine,-.t will nu-ke terms with the Panama Canal Company." This statement was made to-day at tho Stale lie partment in view of the story pul lislied by Tho Republic to-day, exposing the sehenie by which Great Itrilain is en deavoring to rush through a treaty with Nicaragua before the I'nlttd States. Nica ragua ar.d Costa Rica shall Irive concluded their formal treaties for the construction of the Nicaragua dual.

"The Nlcaraguan Government." said one of the State Departmtnt official, "will scarcely be so blind to her own Interests ns to proceed to the negotiation with Great Hrltnln or a treaty which will be hostile to American Interests. Nicaragua ought to know that there cannot be two interoceanlc canals in Central America, for both could not live as commercial enterprises. "ThcTefore. If Nicaragua Is not disposed to deal fairly with the I'nited States in thl matter, this Government can readily retallate by adopting the Panama route a preposition which will always be open to this country. "I! Nicaragua decides to deal solely with Great Britain, to further whatever schemes she may be pursuing to control n canal on lines and with a rollcy similar to those of the Sutz Canal, and objects to a canal under the terms or the Hay-Pauncefoto treaty, then I am certain Nicaragua will find 11 stuccessrul rival in the Panama.

The Stato De partment officials are, however, disposed to rrltlciso what -ipm-ars to be a subtle schemu on tne part at least of Great Itrltain to outwit tho United States la the negotiations for the canal. Tho rcjwrt or the Canal Commission will be sent to Congress by the President tomorrow-. It is understood that tho Prt-s-dent will not send any message of recom mendation with tho report, but will leave Congress to draw conclusions solely from the facts set forth by the commission. While it is not exactly noncommittal, the commission's report leaves a loophole for Congress to select either tho Nicaragua or the Panama route. It points out clearly that both routes are feasible. Nicaragua Is given the prererence conditioned on sat Isr.ictory negotiations with the Govern ments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. ATTOiisuY ;k.m:uai.s
