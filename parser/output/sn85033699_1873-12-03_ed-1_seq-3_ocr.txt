"Margaret Thompson, Sallie Miller, Jen nie llohinson, Ann Phillips and Martha Copaz were arrested last night on the cliarge of being drunk and using profane and vulgar language.

Woodson reported at police head quarters last night that he had been robbed at a Collage street gin mill known as the "Olive Branch."' He then returned to the establishment in question and so conducted himself tliat he was arrested on the cliarge of disorderly conduct. A nesro was stabbed in an affray which occurred at a late hour last night near the Fisk University. Upper Cumberland Coal Mines. During the past two days, a large num ber of coal miners from the upper cumber land country, liave been in the city, having come down the river on coal barges. A large party of these men assembled at the Louisville depot yesterday evening, prepatory to going out to Glasgow Junction via the Louisville and Nashville road. They were a strange looking lody of men, and attracted considerable attention as they walked up and down, or gathered in groups, with their blankets slung over their shoulders and tholr ln i'linmilred with brown lluuiij ais - --- - paper parcels, containing huge sections of ginger-bread and cheese, while lKrttles of whisky were handed about from one to an other in a very hospitable and generous fashion. The writeiinoticed one old coon who had been badly sold in the purchase of a pinchbeck watch, which stopped about the time he got to the depot. One of the party seized the "time keeper," gave it a vigorous shake, and as a faint tick was heard, rapturously exclaimed. "Why, Taylor, she goes diirn her, don't you hear her go?" It was sad to observe howquickly the gleam of hope vanished from "Taylor's" counte nance, us the ticking ceased after a few spasmodic efforts. Another gray headed sinner, who gave evidence of having drank freely of the cup which both cheers and inebriates, insisted upon telling over and over again a little story which might have laid some claims to being funny, . but which grew slightly monot onous alter Hie twentieth telling. The in briated old covey laughed heartily, how over, every time he told it, One of the party, while under the influence of liquor, wandered oil" along North College street, to return after an hour's absence with fifty dollars less money than when he left the depot, according to his own statement, and as some of the residents of that locality are not the most honest people in the world, his statement is not improbable. 

AMUSEMENTS. Opera House. The play of Elizabeth was presented last evening by Mrs. Bowers and her popular troupe, before a large audience. Its ren dition was an admirable success, especially the role of Elizabeth by Mrs. Bowers. With a true appreciation of that great his toric cliaracter, Mrs. Bowers entered into her impersonation with much zeal and en ergy: and if there was not a ilia)t exonera tion of Elizabeth's masculine cjuahlins. of thought and action, Mrs. Bowers succeeded in her representation to perfection.

Since Tweed's convict ion, aidiilo'sophical Nashville man substitutes "Tueeding," fo- stealing" whenever he lus oi-cision to use the latter word. We learn from the Cincinnati jPimes.tbat "Alexander Algernon St. Clair Abrams has begun to sever his connection with the Atlanta Herald." In advertising certain late publications, London booksellers announce: Joaquin Milijjk, Half-Calf. Ciiahles Reade's A Simpleton. The following advertisement is being widely circulated: "Do not find fault with your sewing machine until you have tried the 'Eureka' spool silk," the cist of which seems to be that after using the thread in question iTou would have some reason for finding fault with your sewing machine. The earnest but futile efforts made yes terday by a tipsey individual at the Louis ville depot to drown the whistling and bell-ringing of a switch engine by a vigor ous blowing on a French harp, excited the deepest sympathies of a crowd of urchins. We presume it was the police court fiend of the Nasuville Union Jsn Ameiucan who said of a couple of men on trial: "Dur ing the recital both demons occasionally smiled in a hellish, sarcastic way." Cin cinnati Times. The Times is mistaken. The gifted lunatic who steals "localg" for the Etanstille Courier is the author of the sentence quoted. The St. Louis Democrathas noticed that the men who interrupt the end of a playat the theatre by breaking for the door, all liave low foreheads and scrubby hair. The following note is carefully preserved in a Philadelphia saloon: "Barnum's Hotel, March 23, 1842. My Dear Sir: I am truly obliged to you for the beautiful and delicious mint julip you have so kindly sent me. It's quite a mercy that I knew wliat it was. I have tasted it, but await further proceedings until the arrival of Washington Irving, whom I expect to dine with me, tete-a-tete, and who will help drink ycur health. With many thanks to you, dear sir, thankfully yours, "Ciiaulks Dickens." The Sjmngjield Republican is nonpluss ed: "A singular, not to say startling, piece or intelligence comes from the Wheaten Female Seminary in Norton, Bristol coun ty. We are informed that the young ladies of that institution met, a few days ago, and after comparing notes on the "causes and extent of the panic," actually passed a se ries of resolutions to the elfejt that, hereaf ter, they would keep themselves informed in business matters, and for the present, would abstain froinallunnecessary expendi tures." This last is not so novel plenty of girls, young and old, have spasms of frugali ty; but. can we believe that the Norton school girls are going to grapple with "busi ness matters" and finance and panics? Burdett, of the Peoria J.Yrietc, is discon solate. He accounts for it in this way: If anybody lias seen a black-and-tan dog, ans wering to the name of "Judge." going down street in company with a hard-shell turtle, please halt the eloping pair, as they are the property of the editor of this paper. We are fondly attached to the dog on account of his vagabondish, Bohemianish liabits. lie knows every dog in Peoria by name, and is on speaking terms with uine-tcntlis of the granger dogs that, come in under the wagons, and he knows more of the inhabitants of this city than the tax-collector does. The turtle is a more recent acquisition. It was placed in the back yard yesterday, and the dog spent an hour and a half trying to en tice it to come out of its shell and be so ciable. The old iron-clad maintained his reserve, however, until the dog crammed his nose against the forward part and began to snitr. The pair seemed to come to some understanding at once, for the dog made an impetuous remark on a very high key, and they both startedon a trip afterDonaldson's balloon. When the dog jumped over Fish er's barn we thought he had struck the eastern current and would get right tlirough, but we learn since that he landed and was seen sauntering along like a whirlwind, the turtle staying right by him. We should le very sorry to lose the dog now, as he has acquired another important and valuable quality. He knows more about turtles than any other dog in the country, ard it's mighty hard to find a real good turtle dog. . December Mnjjnxlne.. The principal articles in the Old and Xcw for December are the "Giant Yous," a story from the French of George Sand, "Charity at Cost," "Ferns," "Checkmate to Apaches," a sensational tale, and auother paper on "Country Sights and Sounds." These are all readable and instructive. That on "Charity at Cost" deserves special mention, a it discusses in an interesting manner the important subject of taxation as related to charity. The principles main tained in this paper are in accordance with sound economy. This suggests to us the general remark tliat the Old and Xeio usual ly has some able contributors, whose thoughts are practical and calcu lated to lead men in safe ways. On the other hand we find that its pages are sometimes oien to writers whose thoughts undoubtedly have a mischievous tendency. We will not withold our opin- ... ... . t . i j ion, either, mat some 01 us euuonais are hut little better. They are notuufrequent ly tinged with a hue of sophistry, which must lie distasteful to every intelligent mind. For instance, the last editorial con tains this unqualified statement: The War of the Rebellion will be looked upon in history as the fulfillment of the obliga tion in A ip nmistitulion that the nation should guarantee Republican governments to 1 he States." This betrays either an ut ter ignorance of constitutional law, or a most" censurable disregard for the truth.

EDUCATIONAL. Wilson County Tcnchcrs' Institute. To the Union and American: The second meeting of the "Wilson County Teachers' Institute" was held at Lebanon on the 21st and 22d of November, beginning at 7 P. M. of the 21st. About thirty teachers of the public schools of the county were present, more than have ever attended any siniil.tr meet ing in the county. In addition to those connected with the public schools, several members of the faculty of Cumberland University and the Principal of "Corona" were present, and rendered valuable aid in carrying out the programme of the In stitute and in making the exercises inter esting and of practical benefit to those most concerned. Lectures were delivered on the following subjects by the gentlemen whose names are appended, each lecture being followed by a general discussion of the subject, in which all to a greater or less extent par ticipated.

A constitution was auopteu providing that meetings of the Institute shall be held semi-annually time and place to be fixed by the Executive Committee, and that ac tual or prospective teachers are eligible to membership. A vote ot tlianks was tendered to the deacons of the Presbyterian Church for the use of the basement-room during the ses sion of the Institute, to the citizens of Lebanon and vicinity for hospitality shown to the members, and to the publishers of the Lebanon Herald, Union- and American and Hejmblican JJanner for publishing the programme of the Institute. lakms into account the inclemency ot the weather, the meeting was a decided success. Teachers seemed to realize the impor tance of comparing notes, of interchanging ideas and of adopting from the mass of suggestions offered, such principles as would best promote success in their profession.

Louisville, Dec 2. Gov. Leslie, in his message delivered to-day to the Legisla ture, takes earnest and decided grounds aqamst the lawlessness existing in some counties of the State, stating tliat while he has no authority to call out the militia, as it would conflict with the regular constabu lary force of disturbed districts, yet re commends the appointment of a Commis sioner to proceed to the disordered districts and secure the arrest ot the parties guilty ot complicity or connivance with "the Ku- Klux. Liquidation of the State Debt. The message announces the liquidation of the State debt in full, being last year $9G6,:94; estimated surplus at the close of tiie next meal year, 2o0,um I he Gov ernor savs, concerning colored people, whilst our colored population are straggling so earnestly and with a measure of hopeful success, to educate their children, it occurs to me that we should shape out for them a system of schools and offer them at least the countenance of our approval in theirelfortstoward improve ments. In each of the annual messages I have heretofore delivered to the General Assembly, I called attention to this subject and made recommendations suggestive of my views. I now renew those recommen dations and earnestly invite your attention to this important interest. Our own sense of justice, it seems to me, will not allow us to longer ignore this demand. A WALKING MATCH. (.rent Excitement During the Con. test Another Match Agreed Upon. Boston, Nov. 20. The long pending walking match between Edward Mullen, the champion of Boston, and W. E.

The betting was six to four on Mullen, with takers. t Ilo'clock the men put m their appearance. Harding dressed in a white shirt, blue and red trunks and spiked shoes. Mullen was dressed in a similar manner. The race was very closely contested. Harding made the first mile in 7 minutes and S seconds; Mullen in 7:10. Mullen won the second mile in 7:10 to Harding's 7:11. Mullen led on the third mile, and completed it in S;10. On the fourth mile Harding passed Mullen on tho home stretch.

Williams, for Chief Jus tice of the Supreme Court; B. n. Bristow, for Attorney General, and A. R. Shepherd, for Governor of the District of Columbia. Conrssslonnl Committees. The Republican caucus to-day appointed a committee to report to an adjourned meeting to-morrow, and the subject of the standing committees. There are a few va cancies to be filled in the committees, but no important cliange from their member- ship last session is anticipated. Williams' Nomination. The nomination of Attorney General Williams to be Chief Justice of the Su preme Court was merely read in Executive Session to-day, and laid over for future con sideration. It was expected the Senate would immediately act upon the nomina tion without reference to a committee, as it has been customary to thus compliment the nominee where he is either a member of, or ex-member of that body. Santo Domingo. Among other documents accompanying the President's message, is a letter from President Baez, of St. Domingo, dated Aug. 18, to President Grant, desiring the Gov ernment of the United States to establish a protectorate over St. Domingo to preserve that country from hostile excursions from Hayti. Tlio California Senatorship. Humors of the Morning:. San Filvncisco, Dec 2. The Legisla ture of the State will meet to-day. The adjournment yesterday is considered a trick of sharp practice to give the Demdcrats.and Republicans time to complete their plans against Booth and the Independents whom he leads. It seems to be generally con ceded, however, that Booth will be elected for the long term and some Democrat for tlie short one. Who the latter may be has not been definitely settled. There is a re port that Casserly is working to defeat Booth, but it is not generally credited. There are all sorts of rumors of bargains, com promises and combinations, but the pro ceedings to-day will probably tell the story. Democrallc Mobile. Mobile, Ala., Dec.l,2. In the municipal election to-day the entire Democratic ticket is supposed to be elected by from 200 to 300 majority. 

CUBA. Tlie Surrender of the Virginias. Text of the Proctocol Between Secretary Fish and the Span ish Minister. Protocol of the conference held at the De partment of State, at Washington, on the 20th of November, 1S73, between Ham ilton Pisli, Secretary of State, and Bear Admiral Don Jose Palo de Barnabe, En voy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipo tentiary of Spain. The undersigned having met for the pur pose of entering into a definite agreement respecting the case of the steamer Virgin- ms, which, while under tlie llag of the United States, was on the 31st of October last captured on tlie high seas by tlie fepan ish man-of-war Tornado, have reached the following conclusions: fapain on her part stipulates to restore forthwith the vessel referred to and the sur vivors of her passengers and crew and on the 2oth day ot December next to salute the flag of the United States. If, however, before tliat date Spain should prove to tlie satisfaction of the government of the Uni ted States that the Virginius was not en titled to carry the flag of the United States and was carrying it at the time of her cap ture without right and improperly, the sa lute will be spontaneously dispensed as in such case not being necessarily requirable, but tlie United btates will expect in such case a declaimer of intent of indignity to its llag in the act which was committed. Furthermore, if on or before the 25th of December, 1S73, it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the United States that theYirgiiusdidnotrightfulljcarrj'the Amer ican flag and was not entitled to American papers, the United States will institute in quiry, and adopt legal proceedings against the vessel, and it it be found she has viola ted the law of United States, and against any of the persons who might be guilty of illegal action in connection therewith it being understood, that Spain will proceed according to the second proposition made to Gen. Sickles and communicated in his telegram read to Admiral Palo on the 27th inst. to investigate the conduct of those authorities who have arraigned Spanish laws and her honorable obligations, and will arraign them before competent courts and inllict punishment on those who may have oirended other reciprocal reclama tions to be subject to consideration and arrangements of the two governments, and in case of no agreement, to be the subject of arbitration of the constitutional of the Senate of the United States, given thereto. The constituent cortes of Spain and the United States Senate It is further stipulated that the time, manner and place for the surrender of the Virginius and the survivors who were on lioard at the time of capture, and also, the time, manner and place for the salute to the flag of the United States, if there should be occasion ol such salute, shall lie subject to arrangement between the undersigned within the next day. Hamilton Iusii. Jose Palo De Bahnahe. The protocol in Hnrniin. Havana, Dec 2. The publication of the protocol signed by Secretary Fish and the Spanish Minister, caused intense agi tation and general indignation here, but popqlar feeling soon liecame less excited under conviction that the bpanish govern ment would defend Spanish honor, and un der the confidence which is placed in tlie sense of justice and prudence of the people ot the United btates. Jouvellar issued a proclamation this eve ning advising the people to be calm, and the excitement subsided. The Virginius remains at the arsenal, afloat and in good condition. Tho Virginius Prisoners. Santiago, Nov. 28. The United States steamer Juniata arrived on the' 20th, and her commander visited the one hundred and one Virginius prisoners now remaining here. He telegraphed Consul General Hall, assuring him that no other executions ex cept the 37 have occurred, and that if the American Government demanded the sur render of the prisoners no difliculty would be experienced' in obtaining them. LOUISVILLE. The Library Lottery Postponed. Louisville, Dec. 2.

TIIE LATE DISASTER. The Survivors in London. LoNnoNjDec. 2. Herald Cable Eleven of the survivors from the Ville du Havre departed for Paris to-night. The Railway Company kindly provided a saloon car for them. During their short stay in London everybody vied with each other in comforting the survivors. The storekeepers refused toj accept payment. These oilers were resisted with difficulty. The steamer's agents provided funds, while Morgan Brown and others offered a home to all. This was unnecessary as several of the survivinggentlemensavedenoughfuiKls. Mr. Bishop had three hundred pounds in English notes and gold. It is a remarkable fact that several others, seemingly, had ample time to dress completely. Bishop's watch stopped at 28 minutes after 2; Cramer's watch stopped exactly at half-past two. This leads to the suppo sition that much valuable time was lost in lowerering boats. Owing to the utter absence of discipline after the collision, no orders were given. The officers were distracted. Each helped himself. The long , boat contained no first class passengers. Sailors and coal boys rushed and took possession. The Scotch ship was prevented from preparing imme diately for rescue from its ignorance as to whether serious damage was done the steamer, which arose probably from. inability to communicate in French. Consequently the Loch Erne's boats were not lowered until tlie steamer had gone down. No life preserver was in its proper place. One gentleman, search ing through four cabins, ascertained that the occupants of three or four cabins in midships were probably killed when the Scotchman struck the Ville du Havre. Tlie most of those rescued had been floating from half an hour to an hour before they were picked up. The Scotchman had little comfort to extend to the rescued, beyond open and hearty good will. The ladies chauged. their drenched night dresses fov sailors,' clothlnp't It soon, how ever, liecaiue a question whether the Loch erne all'xiled safety to those on board. Capt. Surmount declared his determination to transfer the crew to some other ship when possible, leaving t?i.Q Pas sengers behind. This, was. resisted by the mate and. Belknap, and after consultation With the carpenter,, they overcame with some difliculty Sunnont's opposition. When the Trimountain was sight ed lhe transfer was effected and the American Captain offered the ladies increased comfort in a neat calyn occupied by his wife. Still when a landing was ef fected at Cardiff at twilight on "Monday, tlie. ladies, were in a state of sem.i-nud.ity, some having only blankets, to, protect them. , va. t t nofuultor Indicted. Des Moines, Iowa, Nov. 30. The grand jury lias indicted ex-State Treasurer Samuel E. Rankin for embezzlement, and his bond, was fixed at 20,000. He was arrested last evening and placed in chsige of a baliifl" until next Monday. It is doubtful whether he can get bondsmen. The result created anxiety among politicians, State and ex State oflicials. The present grand Jury Is composed of Grangers almost entirely. It Is said that a notary appears most like a mule when he is drawing up a conveyance. No. 3 City Hotel Bloci . .
