M'K1X1.RY. "resident Koesexclt Kaloalaea the Uiaeattd Victim ( Aaarrkr. rreldent McKinley vu a man of mod erate means, a wau whose tock s-prat-.g Irom the sturdy tiller of the soil, who liad himself belonged among the wage viirkm. who had entered thr aimy as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at ' when tha preidei.t was assass-li-aled. but j the honest toll which is content with mod crate gains after a lifetime of unremitting labor largely in the service of the public. Still lesa was power struck at In the ene that power I irresponsible or centered In the bands of anv one Individual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest cham pions th wageworker has ever had. at one of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights and represent ative government who has ever risen to public office. President McKinley filled tbat political office for which the entire Gople vote, and no president, not ever ncoln himself, was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought out wishes of the people. Ills one anxiety ir very crisis was to keep in closest touch . with the people, to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expres sion to their thought after having endeav ored to guide that thought aright, lie bad just been reelected to the presidency because the majority ot our citizens, the majority of our farmers and wagework-. en. believed that he had faithfully upheld their Interests for four years. They felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him. They felt that he represented to well and so honorably all their Ideals and aspirations that they wished him to continue for another four years to repre sent them. And this was the man at whom the as sassin struck: That there might be. noth ing lacking to complete the Judas-like In famy of m act he took advantage of an occasion when the president was meeting the people generally, and. advancing as if to taka the hand outstretched to htm in kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned tha noble and generous confidence of the victim Into an opportunity lo strike th fatal blow. There is no baser deed In all the annals of crime. Hla Death a Crswalag Glory. The shock, the grief af the country, art bitter In the minds of all who saw the dark days while tile president yet hovered between life and death. At last the lisht was stilled In the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the lips that even In mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to hi murderer, of love for bin friends and of unfaltering trust In the will of the Most High. Such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with Infinite sorrow, but with such pride In what he had accomplished and in ills own personal character that we feel the blow not as struck at him. but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who Is dead, but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements or his life and the rrand heroism with which ha met his death. When we turn from the man to the na tion, the harm done is so great as to ex cite our gravest apprehensions and to de mand our wisest and most resolute ac tion. This criminal was a professed an archist, inflamed by the teachings of pro fessed anarchists and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who on the stump and In tha public press appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind Is sowed bv the men who preach such doctrine, and thev cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that Is reaped. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish vlslonarv who for whatever rea son apologizes for crime or excites aim less discontent. The blow was aimed not at this presi dent, but at all presidents, at every sym bol of government. President McKinley was as .emphatically tha embodiment of the pooular will of the nation expressed through the forms of law as a New Eng land town meeting Is In similar fashion the embodiment of the law abiding pur pose and practice of the people of the town. On no conceivable theory could tha murder of the president be accepted as due to protest against "Inequalities In the social order" cave as the murder of all the freemen engaged In a town meet Inr could be accepted as a protest against that social Inequality which puts a male factor In jail. Anarchy la no mora an ex pression of "social discontent" than pick jing pockets or wife beating, j Mast Sappreaa Aaarrhy. j The anarchist, and especially the an- archlst in the United States, is merely tone type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the 'same depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates anarchy directly or Indirectly In any shape or fashion or tha .man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds makes himself morally ac cessory to murder before the fact. The anarchist Is a criminal whose perverted .Instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most beneficent rorm of social order. His piotest of concern for workingmen is outrageous in Its impu dent falsity, for If the political Institu tions of this country do not afford oppor tunity to every honest and intelligent son of toll then the door or hope Is forever closed against him. The anarchist Is everywhere not merely the enemy of sys tem and of progress, but the deadly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy Is triumphant, Its triumph will last for but one red mo i meat, to ba succeeded for ages by tha : gloomy nigm oi aesponsm. Hor the anarcntst nimscir. wnemer ne preaches or practices his doctrines, we need not nave one particle more con cern than for any ordinary murderer. He la not the victim of social or political in justice. There are no wrongs to remedy In hia case. The cause of his criminality Is to ba found In his ow-n evil passions , . th vfl conduct of those who tuMA kia nn not In unv failure by others lor by tha state to do Justice to him or hla. He la a malefactor and nothing else. He la la no sense. In no shape or way, a "product of social conditions" save as a hjjrbwayman la ."produced" by the fact that an unarmed man happens to have a Bursa. It la a travesty upon the great jjSjjajy jiejsri or liberty and freedom to ON

It would mean that the office would more and mi-re come to be rilled bv men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in deallnc with everv friend of disorder. This great tour.lry wilt not fall into an archy, and U anarchists should ever be come a serious menace to it institutions thev would not merely he stamped out. but would involve In their own ruin every active or plve sympathizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled It burns like a consuming flame. HfRisrss axi ixnrvrttY. Cnutlnn la Seeded to Preserve the Present Relgw of ProM-rlty. ntirlnc the last five years business con fidence lias been restored, and the nation is to be congratulated because of its pres ent abounding prosperity. Such prosper ity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to destroy It bv mischievous laws.

Moreover, no law can guard us against the cone iuenies or our own follv The men who sn Ml or erduIous. the men who seek gains not bv genuine work with bead or hand, but by gambling in any torm. are alwavs a source ol menace not onlv to themselves, but to others. If the bus'ness world loses Its head, it loses what legis lation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare or each citizen and therefore the welfare of the aggregate or citizens which makes the nation must rest upon individual thrirt and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place or this individual capacity, hut wise legislation and honest and intelli gent administration can give It the full est scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. The tremendous and highly complex in dustrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity durinr the lat ter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face at the beginning of the twentieth with very serious social prob lems. The old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the Industrial changes which have so enormously Increased the productive power of mankind they are bo longer sufficient. The growth of cities has gone on tie yond comparison lasler than the grow.h of the country, and the upbuilding ot Hit .-Atifrs lis meant a startllug increase not inertly 111 the ag gregate of wealth, but in the number ot very targe inuiviuui 1 . .nrai fortunes.

The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to lnt.rfere with it in a spirit of rash ness or Isr.orance.

The mt essential In determining how to Jral with the great mdnstilal lomblna tloiis is know ledge of the tacts-publlclty. In the luteiet of the public the govern-- nienl shoulil nave ine rigu. m u.-i-r, . examine the workings of the great corpu. rations engaged In Interstate business, Publicity Is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further reme dies are needed In the way of govern mental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been ob tained by process of law and In the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete knowledge anich mav be made public to the world. ArtWclal bodies, such as corporations and Joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, apf full and accurate Information as to their osrations should Ik- made public regular ly at reasonable interval. The large corporations, commonly calico trusts, though organized in one state, al ways do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity lu the state laws about them, and as no state has any ex clusive interest in or power over their acts i) has in practive proved impossible to get adequate regulation through slat action. Theretore tn the Interest of the whole people the nation should, without interfering with the power of the states In the matter itseir, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corpo rations doing an interstate business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from th existence of some monopolistic element or tendency In its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Hanks are subject to it. and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed it is probable that super vision of corporations hy the national gov ernment need not go so far as is now tha case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Mas sachusetts In order to produce excellent results. May Take Oonetltatloaal Amendment When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no hu man wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in Industrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the proper authorities to regulate so far as was then necessary the comparatively In significant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are now wholly different, and wholly different ac tion Is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the na tional government to exercise control along the lines above indicated, profiting by the experience gained through the pas sage and administration of the interstate commerce act. If. however, the Judgment of the congress is that It lacks the consti tutional power to pass such an act. then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. There should be created a cabinet offi cer, to be known as secretary or com merce and industries, as provided' ln she bill Introduced at the last session or the congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce In Its broadest sense. Including, among many other things, whatever concerns labor, and all matters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine. The course proposed Is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and far reaching scheme of constructive states manship for the purpose of broadening our markets, securing our business Inter ests on a saTe basis and making firm our m w position In the international indus trial wor'd. while scrupulously safeguard ing the rights of wageworker and cap italist, of Investor and private citizen, so as to secure equltv as between man and man In this republic. TUB rlllSKSH PROB1.KM. llemtmnienda That the Present Ei cl union Law Be Krenacted. With the sole exception or the farming Interest, no one matter Is of such vital mom' nt to our whole people as the wei tare of the wageworkers. If the farmer and the wageworker are well off. It is ab solutely certain thM all others will be well off. too. It is therefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages ar higher to-day In the I'ntted States than ever before in our history and far higher than In any other country. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Kvery effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to se cure the permanency of this condition of things and Its improvement wherever pos sible. Not onlv must our labor be protect ed by the tariff, but It should also be pro tected so far as It Is possible from the presence in this country of anv laborers brought over by contract or of tho who. coming rreely. yt represent a stand-ard of living so depressed that thev can un dersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard 11 as necessary, with this Rd n view, to re enact Immediately the law excluding Chi nese laborers and to strengthen It wherever necessary in order to make Its enforcement entirely effective. Pretertlon for Free Labor. The national government should de mand the highest quality of service front Its employes and lu return it should be a good employer. If possible, legislation should be passed in connection with the interstate commerce- law which will ren der effective the efforts of different states to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open la bor market. So far as practicable un der the conditions of government work provision should be made to render the enforcement of the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all Industries carried on directly or Indirectly for the United States government women and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor, from night work and from work under unsanitary conditions. The gov ernment should provide ln its contracta that all work should be done under "fair" conditions and. in addition to setting a high standard, should uphold It by prop er inspection, extending if necessary to the subcontractors. The government should forbid all night work for women and children as well as excessive over time. For the District of Columbia a good factory law should be passed, and, as a. fpwerlul Indirect jild to such laws. provision should he made to turn the In- 1 habited alleys, the existence of which Is j a reproach to eur capital city. Into minor J streets, whire the Inhabitants can live' under conditions favorable to health and morals. American wageworkers work with their heads us well as their hands. Moreover, they take a keen pride ln what they ate doing, so that, independent of the re ward, thev wish to turn out a perfect Job. This is the great secret of our suc cess In competition with the labor of for eign countries. Uood and Bad of I'aloalaaa. The must vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole civilized world, has to deal Is the prob lem wiiich has for one side the better ment ut social conditions, moral and physical, in large cities and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of "labor." The chief factor In the success of each man wageworker. farmer and capitalist alike must ever be the sum total of his own individual qualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power of acting In combination or association with others. Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wageworkers when managed with rorethought and when they combine in sistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights or others. The display of these qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. Finally there must also ln many cases be action bv the government In nriier to safeguard the rights and Interests of all. Under our constitution there Is much more scope ror such action br the stale and the municipality than hy the nation. Hut on points such as those touched on above the national government can act. When alt Is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the Indispensable prerequisite to success In the kind of na tlonnl life for which we strive. Kuril man must work for himself, and unless he so works no outside help can avail him. Hut each man must remember also that he Is Indeed his brother's keeper, and that while n man who refuses tn walk can be carried with advuutage to hlmseir or anyone else, yet that each at times stumbles or halt . that each ut times needs to have tin I- lp g !,and out stretched to him.

TIIK tariff. Any General Change la It Sot to Bo llcalrrd at Thla Time. There N cenerul acquiescence In our present tarirf system a a national policy. The first icqulslte to our prosperity Is the continuity and stability of this economic police Nothing could be more unwise than" to disturb the business Interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. Poubl. apprehension, un certainty, are exactly what we most wish to nvold in the interest of our commercial and material well being. Our experience In the past has shown that sweeping revi sions of the tariff are apt to prcduce con dition closely approaching panic In the business world. Yel it is not only ssl ble. but eminently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic sys tem a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other nation. Such reciprocity is an Incident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for In the present tarirt law. Recommends Reciprocity. Reciprocity must be treated as the hand maiden or protection. Our first .duty is tc sec that the protection granted by the tar iff in every case where it is needed Is maintained and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries. Just how far this is must be determined according to the individual case, remembering al ways that every application of our- tariff pollcv to meet our shifting national needs must" be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never he re duced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wagework er is a prime consideration of our entire policy of eotKimic legislation. Subject to this provlru of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle, of reci procity must command our hearty sup port. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy ln dealing with rorelgn ra tions. Whatever Is merely petty -and vex atious In the wav of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers tc whom we dispose of our surplus product In the long run directly or Indirectly pur chase those surplus products bv giving us something In return. Their ability to pur chase our products should a far as pos sible he secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enabb; us to take- irom them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. Line of Reciprocal Development. It Is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development of our Interests wheee we are not onlv able to supply our own market, imt to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties In any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection, or ln any case where th article Is not produced here and the duty Is no longer r.ecessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer In exchange for what we ask. The cor dial relations with other nations which are so desirable will naturally be pro moted by th course thus required by our own Interests. The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis. ar.T with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of succvsful competition. 1 ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before It by my predecessor.

MF.RCIIAVT MARIXR. Asks Legislation That Will Restore Oar Prestige on the Seas. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by the congress. It is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant In comparison with that of other nations which we overtoD ln other forms of business. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only trifllng portion of our great commerce is carried In our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping interests, but It would also result in benefit to Ml who are Interested in the permanent, es tablishment of a wider market for Amer ican products and would provide an auxiliary force for the navy. Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping lines, i! established to the principal countries with which we have dealings, would be of political as well as eommer c'al benefit. From every standpoint It Is unwise for the United States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing na tions for the distribution of our goods. It should be made advantageous to carry American goods in American built ships. At present American shipping is under certain great disadvantage when put in competition with the shipping or foreign countries. Many of the fast foreign steamships, at a speed of 14 knots or above, are subsidized, and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carr'erj 9l high speed, have to jnesl the act that the original cos! of building American ships Is greater than Is the case abroad, that the wages paid American offlsers and seamen are very much higher thin those paid the officers and seamen of for eign competing countries and that th standard of living on our shins is f.ir superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals. Our government should take such ac tion as will remedy these inequalities. The American merchant marine should be restored to the orean. OI'R

Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and com merce. The collections from duties on Imports and internal taxes continue to exceed the ordinary expenditures ot the govern ment, thanks mainly to tha reduced iirmy expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so that there will lie any possibility of a deficit, but after providing against any such con tingency means should ba adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit ot our actual needs, tn hla report to the congress the secretary Of the treasury considers all these ques tions at length, and I ask your attention to the report and recommendations.

TJiihllo ..nlxlnn throughout the I'r.lted States has movtd steadily toward a just . appreciation ot the value of forests, whrther planted or of natural growllv. 1 The great part played by Hu m In the ere- atlon aim maintenance 01 iw ii.niouut wealth Is now more fully realized than ever before. Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources, whether of wood, water or grass, from contributing their full share to the wel fare of the people, but, 011 the contrary, gives the assurance ot larger and more certain supplies. The fundamental Idea or forestry is the perpetuation of foresta by use. Forest protection Is not an end r Itself! It U a means to Increase a .id sustain the re--ourres of our country and , ine ministries viiiii. u.e.iu uk.ii .oiii. The preservation of our forests Is an Im perative business necessity. We have come to see clearly that whatever de stroys the forest except lo make way for agriculture threatens our well being. The practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining, grazing. Ir rigation and other interests or the regions In which the reserves He has led to a widespread demand by the people of the west for their protection and extension. The forest reserves will Inevitably be of still greater use In the future than In tha past. Addition should be made to them whenever practicable, and their useful ness should be Increased by a thoroughly businesslike management. 1 Rnreaa of Forestry. I At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the United States geological sur vey and the preparation or plans for their coiwarvatlve use with the bureau of for estry, which Is also charged with the gen eral advancement of practical forestry In the United States. These various func tions should be united in the bureau of forestry, to which they properly belong-. The present diffusion o:' responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective cooperation between, the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves without which the Interests of both must suffer. The scientific bureaus generally should- be put under the department of agriculture. The president should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest re- I serves to the department of agriculture. He already has such power ln the case of lands needed by the departments of war and the navy. Necessity nf Irrigation. j The wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful to the In terests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass The water supply Itself depends upon the forest. In the arid region It Is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of , our whole country to-day If the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for Irrigation. Th forest and water . problems are perhaps the most vital In ternal questions of the United States. Certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the wild forest 1 creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected from fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great Injury done by live stock, above all by sheen. The Increase In deer, elk and other animals In the Yellowstone park ' shows what may be expected when other 1 mountain forests are properly protected 1 by law and properly guarded. Some of these areas have hern so denuded of sur- t face vegetation by overgrazing that tha j ground breeding birds. Including grouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been exterminated or driven 1 away. At the same time the water stor- ! Ing capacity of the surface has been de- j creased or destroyed, thus promoting nooua in limes or rain ana aimir.isnmg ma flow of streams between rains. In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are coming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the Immediate neighborhood, come each summer to on lay the privilege of camping;. Seme at least of the forest reserves should afford; perpetual protection to the native fauna and "flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of tho larger kinds and free camping grounda for tha ever Increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest, health and recreation in the splendid for ests and flower clad meadowa of our mountains.- The forest reserves should ba set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people aa a whole and not sacrificed to tha ahortdhfhted greed of a few. The forattOaro natural reservoirs. By Ttt'T''" ife streams in flood and ror plenishing" them In drought tney make possible the uae of watera otherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from wash ing and so protect the storage restrvolra from filling up with silt. Forest conserva tion Is therefore an essential condition or water conservation. The Coveraaaeat Shonld Asalat. The forest alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are nec essary to equaltxe the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construc tion has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast lor Private effort. Nor can It be best accomplished by the In dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching Interstate problem are Involved, and the resources of single states would often be inadequate. It la properly a national function, at least In some of Its features. It Is as right for the national government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harborc of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoira at the headwaters of our rivers Is but an en largement of our present policy of river control under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams. The government should construct ana maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose Is to regulate the flow of streams the water should 1 turned freely into the channel In the dry season to take Ihe same course under the same laws as the natural now. The reclamation of the unsettled aTld public land presents a different problem. Here It I not enough to regulate the flow or streams. The object ot the government I to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon It. To accomplish this object water must be brought within "fhe rpioneer settler on the arid public domain chose their boni.-s along reams from which they could theiiielve divert the water to reclaim their -holdings.

COLOMES. What the Aim of the- Government Shonld Be la Their Control. lu liawait our aim must be to develop the ttrritor) uii the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthy American community of meu who themselves till the larms they own. All our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this-end in view. The well being ot the average homemaker must afford the true test or the healthy devel opment of the Islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system. It Ls a pleasure to sy that It Is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Kico than as to any state or territory with in our continental limits. The island is thriving as never before, and It Is being administered efficiently and honestly. IU people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection ot the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfare must be as carefully and Jealously consid ered as the welfare of any other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of tree acc-ss for their products to the markets of the I'nlted State. 1 ask the attention of the congress to the need of legislation concerning the public lands of Porto Rico. Reciprocity with Cab. In Cuba such progress has been mad toward putting the independent govern ment of the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the congress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress, and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles aa she unfolds this new page of her destiny we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question or reciproci ty. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national Interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your attention to tho wisdom. Indeed to th vital need, of pro viding for a substantial reduction In tho tariff duties on Cuban Injporta Into .tho United States. Cuba has In her constitu tion affirmed what we desired that aha should stand In international matter In closer and more friendly relations with uc than with any other power, and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial meas ures ir. the interest of her material well being. The Philippine. In the Philippines our problem la larger. They are very rich tropical Islands. Inhab ited by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of progress to ward civilization. Our earnest effort la to help these people upward along- the stony and difficult path that leads to self gov ernment. We hope to make our admin istration of the Islands honorable to our nation by making It of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves, and as an earnest of what we Intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure or material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before in their history. It Is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities with out which the institutions of free govern ment ate but empty mockery. Our peo ple are now successfully governing tbera seles. because for more than a thousand years they have Let 11 slowly fitting them selves, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously, toward this end. What has taken us thirty generations to achieve we cannot exi-ct to see another race ac complish out of hand, especially wheu large portions of that race start very far l-ehlud the point which our ancestors had le.u-htd een iliirt generation ago. In dealing with the Philippine people we must show both patience and strength, f or heai am e and steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not drslre to do for the islanders men ly what has elsewhere been done ror tropic -oplc by even the best rorrlgu government.

Nothing Would 1-enetlt them so much aa throwing them open to Indus trial development. The connection be tween Idleness and mischief Is prover bial, and the opportunity tn do remunera tive work Is one of the surest preventives of war. Of course no business man will 60 Into the Philippine unless It Is to hit iterest to do so. and It Is immensely to the Interest of the islands lhat he should go In. It is theretore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which tho resources ot the islands can t-e developed, so that franchises Our limited terms ot years) can be granted to companies doing business In them and every encourage ment bo given to the incoming of busi ness men of every kind. Not to permit this la to do a wrong to. tho Fnillpplnes. The franchises must bo granted and the business permitted only under regulation which will guarantee tho Islands against any kind ot Improper exploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop It rauat bo given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to Individual enterprise, which has been the real factor In the de velopment of every region over which our flag has flown. It Is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with gen eral transportation, mining, banking, cur rency, homesteads and the use and own ership of the lands and timber. Thesa lawa will give free play to industrial en terprise, and the commercial develop ment which will surely tollow will afford to the people of the Island the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.

Wo should not defer a day longer than neces sary the construction of such a cable, it la demanded not merely for commer cial but for political and military consid erations. Either the congress should Immediately provide for the construction of a govern ment cable or else an arrangement should l-e made by which like advantages to those accruing Irom a government cable may be secured to the gernnient by contract with a private cable company.

Preparation Xesreaaary. Our present navy was begun in IMS. At that period our navy consisted of a collot tion of antiquated wooden ship already almost as out of place against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alclbladea and Hamllcar. certainly aa tha Ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time did we hava men fit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under th wise legislation of tho congress and the successful administra tion of a succession ot patriotic secreta ries of the navy belonging to both poUtl? cal parties the work of upbuilding the navy went on. and ship equal to any In the world of their kind were continually added, and. what was even more impor tant, these ships were exercld at sea Kingly and In squadrons until tha men aboard them were able te get the best possible service out of them. Th result was seen In the short war with Spain, w hich was decided with such rapidity be cause of the Infinitely greater prepared ness ot our navy than ot tha Spanish navy. Whlla awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the ships which destroyed the Span ish sea forces In the Philippine and lu Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those Without whom neither blow could have been struck. The congressmen who voted for years In advance the money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, tp buy the armor plate, the department officials and the business men and wagworkrs who furnished what the congress had author ized, th ecretarlea of the navy who asked for and expended the appropria tions and finally the officers who In fair weather and foul on actual sea service trained and disciplined the crew of the ships when there was no war In sight-all are entitled to a full share In th glory of Manila and Santiago and the respect-accorded by every tru American to those who wrought such signal triumph for our country.
