SESSION OF COURT BUSY ONE County Court is Making Progress on the Docket Trial of Crimi nal Cases Due to Begin Tomorrow The comuy court is now in the midst of an extremely busy session that started on Monday and which promises to continue for some days. One feature tht has meant much lu the progress already made in the han dling of an extremely crowded docket, is the fact that t he parties to almost every action are reporting ready for trial on tho date set. Trial of cases on Ue criminal docket will not come up tomorrow or the following day. The trial of U( cases, being motions for. judgment against certain bondsmen for the pay ment of delinquent costs, and which wered ocketcd fur December 1, have been carried our until the last of the term, to permit of the trial of the jury cases. One of the hardest fought cases of the term is cn today, this being the second day spent on the action. It is the case of J. T. Allen vs. M. V. Gor don and Mrs. M. V. Gordon and is an action of forcible entry and detainer. The suit concerns the possession of a lease on Indian land be' vt 'ug. to Goldie Seely. M. V.

He claims, how ever, to have made arrange ments to pay this amount with another $j0 when the latter installment was due. Later a Mr. Hristoe offered to sell the lease for Mr. Gordon, which transaction, it is claimed, was cul minated, the sale being made to "Allen. The defendant claims thrft the deal was never made, while the plaintiff is suing fur possession of the lease. Th-3 case was started yesterday and it ia expected to consume most of today. Other cases that have been disposed of are as follows: The case of J. R. Hubbard vs. Dutton Township, was continued. J. S. Mullen vs. G. W. Fish er, a suit of attachment, was dismiM ed. V. M. Smitb vs. A. J. Beav."s et al, suit on a promissory note, was continued for the term. A case that created much interest was F M. Hopkins vs. E. P.

The following two cases were dis missed: FJlva S. Rice, doing business as the American Standard Jewelry company, vs. N. G. Steele. Farmers and Merchants Hauk of Sterling vs. the Apache Cotton Oil company, for money had and re ceived. CONDITION TOO GOOD IS COMPLAINT Opinions as to the present conditio!! and prospect of the growing wheat crop vary and it is correspondingly hard to arrive at any definite conclu sion regarding said crop. All agree, however, that wheat never looked fin er at this time of year, which fact some claim to be a detriment. One theory advanced is simply that the wheat, favored with warm weath er and abundant rain, is growing too rapidly and that the danger arises from the possibility of the plants "get ting so large that they will commence to joint, which condition arises nor mally along about April. If the joints start ar.. acquire a i-auk growth be lore the cold weather sets in, some state that the freezes will materially damage the crop, while the shorter wheat will not be damaged in the least. The water soaked condition of the ground makes it difficult to pas ture the wheat. On the other hand, some are look ing forward to the time when the wheat harvest is near, and when often in the past, the ground has been sadly in need of moisture. The abnormal amount of water now falling will un doubtedly soak the ground to the sub soil and entirely eliminate the possi bility of the wheat suffering in the spring for want of moisture. The exact figures as to the acreage in Grady county are not at this time obtainable, hence the increase in acre acs over last year's crop cannot be told. It is a certainty, however, that the acreage is much larger this year than last. Official figures furnished by the government give a total in crease for the state of 39 per cent. Certain parts of western Oklahoma have doubled the acreage and the grain buyers are inclined to the belief that the growing crop w ill prove to be the bumper crop in the history of Okla homa agriculture.
