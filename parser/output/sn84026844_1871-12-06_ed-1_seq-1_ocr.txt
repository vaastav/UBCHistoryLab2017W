At the conclusion ot his :marka there were scores of persons in n 10 audience shedding tears, and other- , 'lsc showing the marked eflect the ad- . ress bad made upon their feelings. SUNDAY. Services were held in the various liurches throughout the town on Sunday (i lornlng, being participated in by the t elegatirs In several of the churches. t At 2$ o'clock Sunday afternoon, the t ariotis Sabbath Schools throughout tlio | >wn met at the Episcopal Church. The ? htire.h was much too small for the large udlence that assembled. Tho schools ^ lined In ilnging several stirring hymns, nd the Superintendent ol the Episcopal iliool, Mr. C. W. Smith, Who officiated, * id In prayer, after which addresses wero 1 iadc by Messrs. Weldcnuall, Davenport, J Jciwcll, Willetts and others. The ad- 1 resses were all good, but the one of Dr. J ildwcll was particularly good,and it bud ' le effect to mrtko the audience believe lat tho Doctof was at home in talking to hlldrcn. SUNDAY NIOIIT. < This meeting was held in the Southern I Methodist Church, all t jo other Churches being closed, anil was the "great meeting" of the Convention. Had the Church been twice as large it would still have beeu too small (or the people l hut came. The meeting waa called lor six and a hall' o'clock, but by 0 o'clock the Church was full, ami a few minutes after that hour Mr. Wcidcnsull stepped forward, and stated that as the house was full, the time would be occupied, until the arrival of the President, in miscellaneous devotional exercises. He gave out a hymn, which was sung with much spirit, after which he a&ked if there was any one in the house who desired the prayers of the meetiug for themselves or friends. At tlrst a tew spoke out, but as the speaker became more anxious, the interest increased; and as he then asked every one to hold up their hand who desired prayers for them, scores ol hands went up. A prayer was then offered by one ol the delegates. The i'resideut appeared am! formally opened the meeting. Five minute speeches wcio then made by nearly every uolegate present. Of these addresses, it would perhaps be unlair to speak of nuy as beinir better than the others, but we leel us though wo must say a word in com- i mendation of Dr. Kidwell's remarks, as tho Doctor certainly excelled himself. At about 8 o'clock a resolution was introduced, recommending the lirst week in January as a week of prayer for the Y. 31. 0. A. Tho President then camo forward and made a very touching address thanking tho people of Clarksburg tor their generous and kind treatment ol tho delegates, aud spoke in a feeling manner about tho work commenced uud the work to do, and begged ol those present not to lot tho good work commenced stop or be retarded. After liis remarks tho President declared the lirat Convention of the Y. M. C. A. State Association at an end. Tho crowd pres?nt seemed but little d is nosed to leavo for their homes, and a hall hour alter tho vislcs were still well tilled by those waiting to givo words of cheer to tho delegates. I At this meeting every clergyman in tho j [own was present anil took part fh the ex- ] jrcises; in fact one of tho marked features )f the Convention was that Beets aud dolominationB were all swallowed up und orgotten, Thus closed the first Htato Convention n ourJBtate, which was indeed a grand i access.

Several bills wcro introduced and re- i lerred. A bill waa reported Irniu the Post Otllcu ( Coinmilteu consolidating the postal laws, t i no liouso went into Uommitteo ol tlie 1 Whole on the President's Message, and dehutcil Uie President's recommendations I lor the absorption ot I he telegraph into the il postal system. The House postal tele- h graph proposition was relerreJ to the Post r Dllico Committee. Special bills were introduced aud refer- t red, among which was one by Mr. Wells, 1< uf Missouri, appropriating money for the ji purchase ot a site and tho erection of a buildings tor a custom house, nostolllce, unci other federal ofllces at St. Louis. r Mr. Faunswohtu, troin the l'ost Otllce li Committee, reported a bill to revise, con- o solid a to, and amend the statue relating to d the Post Ollico Department. He stated t< that it was tho sumo bill which passed the c House at the last session ot Congress. The It postal laws had never been certified to linco the organization ot tho department ind many ot theru had become obsolete, , while others were contradictory and difll:ult lor explanation. Tho 

CLKHK proceeded to read tho bill, which is very volumiuouB. Tho readiug >! the bill was interrupted by tho oxpiraion of tho morning hour, when the House vent into Committee of the Whole on the ['resident's annual message. Tho usual resolutions distributing porions of the message among tho approbate committees were offered by Mr. )avis and adopted. IJelore tho vote was taken Mr. Wood nquired whether theru was any such .ommitteo as tho Committee on Insurrecionary Slates. Air. Dawks replied that thero was a lommittee which went by that name, and vhich was raised hist session lor tho pur- 1 wtuA of rfinaiitnrinir flu> unlilort wliirli it vua now proposed to refer to it the Kit* Clux outrages. Mr. Wood said that this committoo was irought into existence lor the purpoao of 'isitiug the Southern Btatea to do certain lungs; that when tho committee had retorted to tho House it had no further unctions. Ho was therefore opposed to cviving it for the wholo Congress in his surreptitious manner. Mr. Dawks stilted, in reply to Mr. t(: Vooi), that tho terms by which the com- tl| nitteo was constituted provided that it U hould continue during tho present Con;ress; but even if that wero not so, there I>( lad been'yesterday referred to that comnitteo some measures which would have ?i evived it if it had expired. Hi Mr. Wood protested against tho contin- ,lfl ince of the committoo, which was not inly useless, but promotive of disorder sii >nd distraction throughout tho country. Mr. ItAMsyKMi thought that tho qucsion of a union telegraph and postal Her'ice, and all i|uestionsof subsidies,should ;<> to tho Committee on Commerce or the K' 'ost Oflico Committee, instead of to a rc ii.. i....i an if creating select conunittccs to consider t'1 nccial subjects. Ho remembered when i" lie llrBt 1'ueitlc railroad committee was stablished? the Speaker of the House ni nude it up in the interest of the road; and hi hat that committee was prepared to th ;ivo away all the land of tho nation. Wl Mr. Farnswohtii moved that the sub* *e net bo referred to the Post Ofllco Comailtce, oh it was tho only ono having lei ironer jurisdiction. ex Mr. 1)awkh said this was a great subset, worthy tho consideration of the in, ouutrv, and which was being forced e" pon its consideration by tho events and W| undcnciesof tho age. If anything re- $1 uircd a special commitee which would avo time to consider it, it was this sub5?L m Mr. Nihlack Biitrffcsted that tho nroiect m rould entail fin immense patronage outhe dministration, which would havo tho T p|)oinlment ol at least 8,000 employees *i( j take charge of the telegraphic business, 80 rliich fact made the proposition an apailing one to him and would control his v ote against it. P? Mr. FAnNswonnr understood that it 1,0 ras proposed to incorporate with every J511 unsiderablo post ofllco in the country a J,r jlegraph ofllce and to make every post- "c laater a telegraph operator, orelso to rel ppoint an expert to operate the telegraph. co ho government would thus havo cog- Tc' izance of all private, confidential and 'nl nancial business of the people. Every f? lember ol Congress would bo Importun- l)r il by his constituents to make their post wl fllce a telegraph station. The Post Office Pc lommittee had been appointed without J1}' clerence to this subject, and might there- *{ )re be presumed as fair as one appointed pecially. He was willing to admit he }j ad gone over the whole subject and was t'1' gainst the whole scheme. The success n 1 t tho system in Great Hritain or any P" liickly settled old country, where no new ost offices bad been established for fifty ears, formed no criterion for this conn- re; y. Tho whole thing was monstrous in rcl ny way it could bo regarded. Jhi Mr. Iiankb remarked that the question sr - i-i 1? . i._ t.?? in I ocean ciiuiun nns uuuui uiu juiibuiuiiuu I the Foreign Committee, awl moved "n lint point be Btrlcken from the pending pollutions. rcl Mr. Dawks assented to the resolution o modified. Mr. Daskb thought it best for tho incrests ot the countly to avoid special rn ommittccs whonever tbero was a per- on innent Htandlng Commiltce to whom cU he subject could Ire referred. pii Mr. Buck, a member of the Special de !ommittce ol the last Congress, said that ini lie cost and elTcct of the project bad been mderstood wrong. There were now 5,- en 00 stations in the country, with 77,000 fri allesoflineand 7,000employes. Under ra he Government plan there wonhl be at st< oast 20,000 telegraph offices, 150,000 miles th it line and 25,000 employes. Hebelieved tri he proper committee that of Appropria- re ions, who would lie very carelul in re- hr ommending anything that would take ca rom the people not |:I5,000,000 but $70,- cn >00,000. lie did not believe tho commit- th ec conld ever consider tho station scheme w or a moment. Mr RandaMi wished to slop this scheme T if plunder at the threshhold. Me wns inornicd tiiat originally the whole o( the elcgraph lines would not cost ov?.r two re ir three millions, and now the company w lad tho effrontery to ask Congress to'tnke m Is properly at the appreciated value, lie m vould oppwo the scheme because it Ri vould placo the whole private and busi- n less transactions of the people under the I,( scrutiny ot Uuvttnment officials. He hoped ilia House would squelch' the thing at ouce. Mr. Dawks did not uuderstuiul that any project had becu recommended. The statement of Mr. Randall that the telegraph company ask Congress to purchase Its properly at enormous rates showed that the gentlemen didn't understand the relations of the matter any more than a baby. The Western Union company was irraying itself with all its power and intluence against any such propositions. Mr. Heck remarked that while the , Western Union company opposed the , iroject ut the lust Congress ho underitood it hud chapgcd position, and now is mxious for it. i Mr. Dawkh said that fact would not lommend the matter to his approval, but i his was not the time to enter upon the i nerits of the whole subject. j Aiier further discussion by Messrs. | 'almbu and Gaufikld in favor and , Hessrj. Conner and Kinu against a , pecial committee, the subject was refer- \ ed to tho Committee on Appropriations. ( Mr. Cox moved a reference of that por- i ion ol the mcssago relative to tho now [ iun to the Committee on Banking. He- \ noted and tho subject lelt with tho Ways nd Means Committee. H t Air. Wasiihuhn, ol Mass., presented a \ esolution, which was adopted, lor inquiry i lto the expediency of the establishment r i a labor bureau in connection with the epartment of agriculture, with a view I ?tho compilation of statistics and a more t omplete recognition ot tho rights of tho j iboring classes.
