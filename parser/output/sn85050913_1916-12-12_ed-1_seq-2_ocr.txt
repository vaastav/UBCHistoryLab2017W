"When the church had no sword but the sword of the Spirit, when her disciples knew nothing of per secution except what they suffered, her influence was irresistible.

The Mormon ass knows his mas ter's crib. That is the reason he is Always with the political party that takes care of sugar. Some of the women's clubs have the right idea of reducing the high cost of living. They advise people to buy cheaper food. Strange that nobody thought of that before. It will be a mighty good thing for the republican party when Senator Reed Smoot of Utah is put upon the shelf. Had he and a few others like him been barred from the Chicago convention, election results would have been different. "It is a fundamental principle* o£ the democratic party that the feder al government has no power to levy import duties except for the purpose of revenue only." Then why put a tariff on dye stuffs to encourage do mestic production? some of the wealthy people who take so much pains in ascertaining how to best spend their money would devote a part of their ener gies to the question of how to best spend their time they would be bet ter off and when the latter problem were solved it would solve the form er. Hiram Johnson would stand a bet ter show of being the next republi can candidate for president had his majority in California been a couple of hun.dred thousand smaller than it was.

The paper was estab lished by C. JS. Jordan and J. W. Mowery. Peterson Bro's* secured possession of the property in 1899 and have conducted it since. They have made of it one of the good country weeklies of the state as well as a paying business proposition. Success to them in the future. Don't worry about the inflow of gold. The yellow metal will go out fast enough after the war is over and the democratic tariff has a fair chance to surrender our markets to foreign producers. In 1914, before the European conflagration began, our financiers were greatly alarmed at the influx of foreign made goods and the consequent out-go of money to pay for them. Just be patient, the pendulum will return in due time. "It must be conceded that there are such (private) rights in every free government beyond the control of the state. A government which recognized no such rights, even the most democratic depository of power, is, after all, but a despotism. It is true it is a despotism of the many, of the majority, if you choose to call it so but it is none the less a despotism."—Supreme Court of the United States, "American State Pa pers," p. 191. President Wilson received eight -votes in Utah to every five cast for Hughes. What do you suppose those 'Mormons saw in Wilson which so 'elicited their sympathy and support? Nonpareil. The Mormon church has large holdings in sugar and Utah lias vot -ed republican because the republican 'party stands for protection to sugar, ..^but when President Wilson backed up on free sugar the Mormons of l?tah say they had nothing to fear 'from him and gave him their votes jto encourage him for what he had N^done for tlieir interests. I The appointment of E. D. Chassell \by Gov. Clarke as railroad commis sioner is meeting the commendation of people who know Mr. Chassell. •The only thing that can be brought iip against him is that he has held 3ubllc office much of .the time dur ing late years. But he always "fills the bill" and the public is really more interested in the service ren dered than in the man who renders it. Ed. Chassell is one of the best known men in Iowa and never has his name bqen linked with anything that was questionable. As railroad comtniBsioner.^fre Freaman-Tri *rt will expect III Y*.

According to a Washington dis patch imports for the first nine months of the calendar year ended September 30, 1916, totaled $1,831, 000,000 in value, an increase of $504,000,000 over the similar per iod of 1913, which was the last nine months under a protective tariff law. The customs revenues derived from these imports during the first nine months of 1916 totaled $164, 600,000, compared with $237,700, 000 for the first nine months of 191-3, or a loss in revenue from this source of over $73,000,000 on a 39 per cent increase in imports, to be made up by internal taxation^ When the Susan B. Anthony amendment comes before congress the opposition can point to t^ie fact that the women voters of the coun try are on record against it. Presi dent. Wilson was against it and Judge Hughes was for it and as the women of the west voted for Wilson it is clear that they endorse his atti tude. Therefore,, since the women voters of the country are on record against taking tl\p matter out of the hands of the states congress would be justified in giving little heed to the noisy suffragists who. bombard that body with requests for the adoption of the Anthony amendment. It will be a long time before the west will be willing to lose the pow er it now has in the electoral col lege by voting in favor of electing presidents by direct ballot. Under such a, plan such states as Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Utah, Ari zona, Montana and North Dakota would cut such a small figure that they Would get little consideration from the powers that be. Mr. Bry an will no doubt find later on that the west is not with him in this mat ter. Then it will be up to Mr. Bry an to drop that issue and as he has great experience in the art of drop ping issues he will turn the trick with dignity and rapidity. There are dozens of ways in which the state could reduce public expen ditures for state, county and muni cipalities, and at the same time im prove the service. The number of leg islators could be cut in two in the middle. That would save many thousands of dollars and would make the legislature more serviceable. TPhen registration of voters in cities of less than 15,000 could be abolish ed and a great saving result to the towns having a population between 3,500 and 15,000. The legislature could also enact a law giving city councils the right to make street im provements when property owners so desired, thus saving some of the "overhead" expense. These are only few of the—changes that might with profit be made. The suffragists are going to bom bard congress this winter in the hope of getting through the Susan B. An thony amendment. President Wil son has been against it, but the wom en now believe that since they have demonstrated their power as voters in the west the president can be con vinced of the error of his judgment In this view, the women are correct. If they can make President Wilson believe it is to the advantage of the democratic party to pass the Anthony amendment they will have won him to their side. There is nothing that will so appeal to Woodrow Wilson as votes and he can change his mind in the twinkling of an eye if he can make votes for his party by so do ing. Just watch him reverse himself upon the universal suffrage proposi tion. A few days ago the agreement be tween Russia on the one side and England, France and Italy on the other to the effect that Russia is to have Constantinople and the straits was read in the Duma. The only thing that is preventing Russia from taking immediate possession of these desirable properties is a con dition over which she has no con trol. However, a Petrograd dis patch announces that the dream of a thousand years is about to be re alized by Russia. From this dis tance, it looks as though the realiza tion of that dream is still a very dubious and doubtful thing. Howev er, if Russia can get the consent of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Tur key along with that of the other countries already secured the thing will be accomplished. People who are seeking for good substantial foods at reasonable prices will find them in rice and corn. Rice can be prepared in many ways and it is very nutritious and palatable. During the closing days of the Rus sian-Japanese war the Japanese sold iers lived almost entirely upon rice. It can be had at six or eight cents a pound and contains as much food value as anything that can be pro cured at that price. Corn meal is also comparatively cheap and can be prepared for the table in many dif ferent ways. If the public would use more rice and corn it would be benefitted in both purse and health. The Webster City Freeman-Trib une does not think the women vot ers who helped to defeat Hughes treated the republican party square ly. The Nonpareil agrees with the F.-T. that Hughes ought not to have been defeated, but it is unfair to the women to charge them with re sponsibility for the result. Wilson carried Ohio, Nebraska and North Dakota and came within 400 votes of getting Minnesota and in none of these states do women vote. Among the suffrage states Hughes carried Oregon, and Illinois. As Billy Payne explains, it was not the voters in petticoats who beat .Hughes it was the voters who are not in petticoats but ought to be who turned the trick.—Council Bluffs Nonpareil. All of which may be true, but the women of the west could have elect ed Hughes had they wanted to do so. They pretended to be against Wil son because he W£\p against national suffrage, but. at least half of them voted for him. Another, phase of the unjust work ing of the electoral college system of electing president. The state of New York has only one elector for each 225,000 of its population while the state of Nevada has one elector for every 27,000 of its population. The 10th congressional district of Iowa with a population of about 250,000 has but one elector,' while Nevada with less population and less vote has three electors. This thing should not be longer endured.— Eagle Grove Eagle. The Eagle points out some things that are unjust, to be sure. But the state of Nevada and the other small er states have the same unfair re presentation in the United States senate. The state of Nevada with a population of only 81,000, has two United States senators, while New York state, containing 9.113,001) people, has the same number. Each state has two senators, regardless of population. This arrangement was made that the various sections of the country might have representa tion, thus enabling each section to wield a fair share of influence. If the membership of the United States senate were based upon population it would be easier for the thickly settled districts to disregard the rights of the more sparsely populat ed regions. But what injustice might result from giving the small er states large power in the elector al college is nothing compared with I became so accustomed to it and it has so seared the conscience of the nation that even northern demo crats defend it and denounce those who condemn it. The republican party ought to set its face as flint against direct elections of presidents until a free ballot and a fair count is assured in every section of the country. 

PRESIDENT ~0 VERDR A W S. "I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupation should be obliged by law to contihue in an employment which he desired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving the approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a new principle into our jur isprudence which I take it for grant ed we are not prepared to intro duce."—President Wilson's message. The president, it appears to the Freeman-Tribune, overshoots tfle mark. Nobody will seriously contend that a man should be compelled to work at something against his will. But there is a va3t difference be tween the individual workman vol untarily quitting work to better his condition and an organization of workmen quitting in a body to co erce increase in wages, throwing the country into chaos and paralyizing business and commerce. The public certainly have some rights which employees and employers ought to be bound to respect. The public may have no direct interest In con- troversies between the .railroads and their employees, but when the em ployees tie up the. business of the country, spread famine and wanf. through the nation by paralyzing the arteries of transportation, the public is vitally interested and some means must be provided to take care of the public's rightg. So far as the Freeman-Tribune is con cerned it expects nothing from Pres ident Wilson. He is interested more in the votes of trainmen than in the general welfare of the country, as was demonstrated by liis surrender to the unjust demands of the broth erhood just before election. Howev er, a real statesman may be elected president four years hence, one who is not so intent counting the result at the ballot box that he will rise above the clamor of the hour and lead the nation out of this appar ently hopeless condition. THE 

NATION'S DISGRACE. Charles City Press: Excludin the old confederate states from the recent election,. Hughes received 8, 000,000 to votes to Wilson's 7,000,000 -—a majority of 1,000,000 for Hughes, but this southern block of states where elections are a farce and where a man has no choice of par ties, gives Wilson the technical elec tion. Of course there are apologists for this political crime even among the people of the north just as there were apologists for the rebellion, as among some people party interests stand higher than those of their country but no one can legitimate ly justify a system of blind obedi ence to one party through intimida tion, where one vote represents three in every other section of the coun try. It is the one great blot and disgrace to this nation. THE PIONEERS. Times-Republican: A man named Sargent died the other day in Pasa dena whose story is typical of a class which is practically eliminated from Iowa—the Iowa pioneer. This man came to Iowa when he was a boy of island found employment as a stock buyer. He came to northwestern Iowa in IS58 riding a horse across country from Marshalltown. There he founded the present town of Ak ron. He bought and' sold land but kept more than he Bold. Later he built a flourishing mill at Portland ville. This mill was folfowed other mills built, by kim at points South Daleota, .. Iiw.jjjrew,. .w eal thiy and went to California seeking health and died there. And the or- I iginal entry of 160 acres on which the injustice caused by the repudi-'bis first home was made is still part ation of the constitution in the states of the south. Mississippi has intimidated and bulldozed its voters to such an extent that over half of them never go to the polls and those who do go never have their votes counted. True, Mississippi could re turn half a million votes if she wanted to,Tnd that is just what she would do if presidents were elccted by direct, vote instead of by the elec toral college. The solid south, where fair elections are unknown, could manipulate the vote and give the democratic candidate for president a majority of 2,000,000 just as eas ily as tha£ section now gives him a majority of 1,000,000. Then there would never be any show for the ejection of any but a democratic president. No matter what the is sues or who the candidates every state that joined the Confederacy returns the same democratic major ity. And that result is secured by fraud and crimc and the countrv has of his estate. It is the old story of the success ful pioneer who stayed by the coun try, believed in it, worked for it and won with it. One of Sargent's sons is a lawyer and general cotinsel for the Rock Island in Iowa. Which is only following the story of the Iowa pioneer into the second generation. It is a common story in its way. "Gene Ellsworth drove livery teams over northern Iowa convoying land seekers, many of whom turned from the prairie and sloughs of Wright and Franklin and Hardin to go far ther and fare worse. And as he could, from time to time he bought land and stayed with, it wringing out his interest, somehow and selling now and then to make payments. He trusted the country. And 'Gene Ells worth died a double and treble mil lionaire because he believed in the section where he lived and stayed with it. He left landmarks that will be monuments in northern Iowa and that further corroborate his faith in Iowa and that particular part of Iowa and his love fof its people. The country owes much to the men who believed in it and stayed by it. They aided and led its devel-: opment. But the pioneer and those who succecd him in heirship owe more to the country. Many of them, like 'Gene Ellsworth paid their debt liberally. Otners still owe it or the debt has been transferred to their descendants and legatees. A 

CONDITION. Tho strongest endorsement of the Wilson administration is found in Chicago, where the municipal lodg ing house will not be opened at all this winter. Cause: no unemployed to need its shelter. For years and years, through republican and demo cratic administrations alike, Chi cago's municipal lodging house has been a haven of refuge for the job less and homeless wanderer, but now it is idle and empty. Every man who wants a job has one and the old "flop house" will remain closed.— Manson Democrat.
