The Chicago Inter-Ocean in an able editorial, shows that the tyranny of monopoly is being gradually overcome and large corporations are now more amenable to public opinion than ever before. Our esteemed contemporary, the Grand Forks Plaindealer, thinks that there is no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties. It reached that conclusion last week. Bro. Murphy is evidently drifting to wards the Democratic camp. General Logan will oppose the con flrmation of all appointments made to (ill vacancies when veterans have been removed without cause. When "Black Jack's" aboriginal spirit gets fully aroused the fur will fly in more than one direction. The president's message has been criticized more severely by the Demo cratic press than that of any former president by the newspapers of his own party. This fact may be regard' ed as creditable to the president but ominous of trouble in the family. Mr. Cleveland is too nearly in sympathy with the best Republican ideas to con tinue popular with his own party. The legislature of the state of South Dakota—to be or not«£o be—met on Monday the 14tli. Hugh J. Campbell called the legislature to order and an organization was regularly effected. Its representatives, jn the name of liberty and justice, will ask congress for a proper recognition and for the admission of South Dakota to the sis terhood of states. It is generally conceded that- the president's message is a document of considerable weight, hut its failure to make any reference to the claims of our territory has aroused a sense of keen disappointment throughout Dakota. We can only forgive Presi dent Cleveland when lie comes out with a supplemental message, strongly recommending the division of Dakota and the admission of the southern part. And ho should not delay this duty long. We would again call attention to the petition being circulated for sig natures, asking congress to open for settlement the pine lands of the Red Lake reservation. Let everybody sign it. It is being sent out at the wish of Hon. Knute Nelson, representative from Minnesota, who will again intro duce a bill to congress providing for the opening of this reservation and the sale of land on the stumpage plan. Every settler in North Dakota is in terested in this movement. Let Con gressman Nelson be backed up lu this light by the largest petition that ever went to congress from the Northwest. As it is now, T. B. Walker has a monopoly in the lumber business for all this country. He owns a large tract of pine lauds iu the vicinity of Red Lake. Steenersou Bros., of Crook' ston, also own a large area of pine timber, but it is situated farther up the Wild Rice than Walker's and the latter has a system of locks for his own use, which he can throw open at the right time to cause logs above to run aground. Last spring Steeiierson's were compelled in this way to sell their logs to Walker. Of course, Nelson's bill will encounter a strong adverse lobby influence. He should therefore be backed by an expression of public sentiment its direct and forci ble as possible. 

GRANT'S MEMOIBH. The first volume of Grant's Per sonal Memoirs" is now beingdelivered by the agents of the work. The book will be read with great interest, not alone by reason of its authorship, but for the readable style in which it is written, and the interest that attaches to the events and incidents narrated, many of which could by no one else be so graphically and authoritatively told. We need not here refer to any of the remarkable features or circumstances of Grant's career, such for iustiince as hauling cordwood to sell in 1858 and being elected president in 18G8, in the meantime having become distinguish ed the world over for his military success. The events connected with such a transition must be of deep interest. The following letter, written as late as 1801 sounds strange to us now: Galena, Illinois, Col. L. Thomas, May 24,1861. Adj. Gen., U.S.A., Washington, D.C. Sir:—Havingserved for fifteen years iu the regular army, including four years at West Point, and feeling it the duty of everyone who has been ed ucated at the government expense, to offer their services for the support of that Government. I have the honor, very respectfully, to tender my ser. vices, until the close of the war, in such capacity as may be offered. I would say, in view of my present age and length ot service, 1 feel myself competent to command a regiment, if the president in his judgment, should see lit to intrust one to me. Since the lirst call of the president I have been serving on the staff of the governor of this state, rendering such itid as I could in the organization of our state militia, and am still engaged in that capacity. A letter addressed to me at Spriuglield, Illinois, will reach me. I am very respectfully, Your obt. svt., U. S. Grant. But this letter was not thought worth answering at headquarters. A prominent Democrat of Grand Forks expressed the opinion a few days ago that "Greely's Americau Conflict," "Blaine's Twenty Years in Congtess" and Grant's Personal Memoirs will be the three permanent authorities of that class in American liteiature. The Fargo Republican is out square ly for division, but Major Edwards is still unmistakably on the fence. We have reason to believe that he is pro foundly studying the merits of the question as to which side is likely to win, which being determined, his pon derosity will get there with lKth feet. We are informed that Sheriff Hawk of CavAler county, on the preliminary examination was found guilty of man slaughter and released on $500 bail to appear at the district court. We doubt the correctness of this, however, as it would argue more ignorance than is fair to presume of a justice. ernes*. The boys are making grand prepar ations for their concert to be held during Christinas week. A blue ribbon gospel temperance meeting will be held in Mr. Henry McGuinn's house. Your correspondent means to be there and will hope to see a goodly gathering of the boys. By the way we understand that Rev. Macnamara has brought a wife back with him. We welcome the lady and wish them all kinds of happiness and succcss as they sail down the stream of time to gether. The tea meeting held in the school house on Thursday evening was a grand success. The program was interesting and entertaining, as we surmised it would be and the finances mounted up to $50. Miss Lily Houny carried off the quilt and Miss Nina Lee appeared as the most popular young lady for she took the cake." The Mesdames Henry, Finlay and Clias McGuinn were the committee appointed to carry out the arrangements for the evening and it most decidedly re flected great credit on their abilitv to manage. 

CROWK CENTRE. Rev. C. A. Macnam&ra will move into Mr. Lusk's house on Friday, where he will live until spring, when the parsonage will be built. The trustees are away buying furniture. The Christmas tree will be held in the school house on Thursday 24th. All who want a apod old fashioned time will do well to attend. Candy and nuts forth* children §nd the adults will please pay a quarter entrance fee. Perfection at last. Having paid strict attention to the production of abetter style and quality of boots and shoes than are commonly made, I take the pleasure of calling the readers attention to the fact. Experience shows that good custom work is appre ciated by all, and that not low prices, but the best of material and style is what is wanted. My price for a good boot or shoe are not the lowest, because I make no cheap or shoddy goods the latter of which is dear at any price. I claim for iny boots and shoes that they excel all others manufactured first in style, second in neatness of fit, third in quailtv and fourth in superior workmanship. All woik warranted, and can be sent to any one per parcel post to any part of the states or territories at one cer per ounce.

It appears to be a notable fact that the best farmers, and the best stockmen are the very best friends of newspapers. It is generally the old fogy and the ne'er-do-wells, that scoff at "book and newspaper larnin," and if they are in duced to bike their home county paper they never read it. The progressive farmers, those who get thirty bushels of wheat to the acre, and own fine, fat, sleek cattle and horses, are invaiiably men whose sitting room table will be generously supplied with, not only local newspapers, but agricultural journals, books relating to stork, to feeding ani mals, which contain the thoughts and experiments ot able men, who devote their time and. energies to advance the cause of agriculture and to learn how to product- more abundant crops, as well as to surround their stock with the best conditions for raising them Mict.-e.-nfiiily and profitably. Every fanner in the Northwest will be benefitted greatly by subscribing to one or more good agricultural papers, ami if one is published near by it certainly should be a regu'ar visitor in the family.
