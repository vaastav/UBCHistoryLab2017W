A PROCLAMATION FB0M MR. BAYARD, JR. Our rather stilted and somewhat erratic young Senator in Congress, Mr. Bayard, Junior, has published a sort of proclamation to the people of the State, accompanying a letter which he eayB he wrote to President Grant, October. To tho letter the President has— strangely '.—made doshing some audience, prints it. Among other thiugs, Mr. Bayard told the President, that day been into med by U. S. Marshal Dunn that it United States troops stationed at the polls in the day of the election. Also, bill its the 15tli of the had of reply, and tlie Senator, the 15th of October, that he had his (the Marshal's) intention to have this State, wrote the Senator, " there is not and never has "been the slightest pretext to anticipate any "interference with the perfect freedom, order " and legality of added, that " nowhere in the Union has (sic) "justice, propriety, and decorum been " thoroughly preserved and maintained titan by "tlie Democratic party in the State of Delaware." they true ones ? A Senator of tho United States writing to the President of the United States, and bla zoning to the publio the performance, must bo held to the severest hue of accuracy. When, therefore, Mr. Bayard says there Ootober, the slightest pretext to anticipate inter ference with the November elections, he misleading tho President, and mis-stating the true condition of affairs. We only state what is a known aud acknowledged fact, in saying, trary to the flaunted assurance of Mr. Bayard, that in many of the hundreds of this State, and especially in St. Georges, Appoquinimink, Mis piliion, Broad Creek, and Georgetown, the col ored voters were in fear of violence against them, at tho polls, and were reasonably and juBtlyin fear. Tho malignancy of tlie feeling against them had been oxprossed in ways that plain and uumistakablo, and which but the natural results of the appeals of Demo cratic speakers and writers. Tlie colored voters felt that at many polling ploceH in Delaware, they could vote, only at tho risk of their liveB and limbs, and they very properly looked for protection, not to the State laws wliich hail been framed for their injury, but to the broader system wliich liad restored to them the liberties , and tlie francliises of Americans. When Mr. Bayard thus wrote to tho President, the " Littlo Election " had already passed, and at poll, they had been angrily and crowded, has elections." Further, he to ed, Those be brave words.

Senator Bayard has apparently intended to air bis greatness before its admirers, and lie has made only an exhibition of immature discretion. There was nothing to rocommcnd Iuh lettor when it was written, but to publish it now, when its nioHt positive predictio fulfilled, when tho action of others removed all cossity for its ostensible purpose, and when the President has silently pigeon-holed its folly,is —to be gentle—an act of absurdity. OUR 

MINISTER TO TURKEY-LETTER FROM HON. JOSEPH J. LEWIS. Judge Joseph J. Lewis publishes in tho West Chester Republican a very interesting letter, stating the facts in regard to the foreign mission of Mr. Wayne McVoagh. With tho double object of striking at Senator Cameron, as well as his exceedingly ill-natured state ments have beon put iu circulation on the sub ject. and those Judge Lewis briefly and conclu sively meets. As to Mr. McVoagli's health, he shown to bo " He lias not had a day's sickuess since lus arrival in Turkey, and ho has fully recovered from tlie nervous exhaustion under which lie suffered before he left homo, and i ho has been at any time within the last ton to the occasion ami mamior of his Then appointment : "The truth, however, is, that neither Mr. MaeVeagli nor Gen. Cameron asked for the ap pointment, and when it was offored to Mr. MaeVeagli he hesitate«! to accept it.

Mr. Morris was personally unknown to tho President, and Gen. Grant desired to give the place of minister acquainted. He therefore, without the aid of a suggestion from any one, aß I have reason to believe, ms Jo choice of Mr. MacVoigh, and voluntarily tendered h the mission." Hon. Edw. Joy Morris, whom Mr. Mac Veagh supersedes, as Minister, has roceived his with tho utmost possible kindness. He gave him much of his society, presented him to the «diiof officers of the Stato, accompanied hi bis first audiouco with the Sultan, ami invited to occupy his furnished house at Peru, until lie could permanently establish himself. In fact, Mr. Morris received his appointment, of Mr. Lincoln, by Senator Cameron's approval and influence, aud Judge Lewis lias evidence in liiB possession that Mr. Morris still retaiiiB a lively of his obligation on that account. It having been further said that Mr. MaeVeagli (say $5000) for his "outfit," • al I a with whom he Iiii «hew a large that statement is corrected. It is not lowed, the law permitting it having bet pealed. It is very gratifying to have thus authorita tively contradicted the reports, not only as to Mr. Mac Veagh's health, but his course in regard to this appointment, aud the letter of Judge Lewis is timely aud oouoluBive. It will give great satisfaction to the many friends of «"* ? Minister to Constantinople.

The design was to establish an immense coal depot at Salem,Mass.,run the steam colliers thither and by the quickness of tho transit aud the facility of loading aud unloading, command the markets of Now England. Instead of carry ing this out tlie present managers of the Reading to havo decided that tlie design was a liura tlxe steamers miscella bug, for they have ously, anywhere at all, without any plan of action, and tho coal trade of the season has proved a lamentable failure.

REEVES " That from Jan. 1, 1871, to Jan. 1, 1881, citi of the United States may purchase and import into the ports thereof, tions, iron and composite foreign-built vessels for the foreign carryiug trade, restricting such vessels to the following classes : sailing vessels, to be wholly of iron, and to be not lesH than 1,500 tons measurement ; composite sailing sels, to be not loss than 1,800 tons; steam vessels to be wholly of iron, and to be not less than 2,000 tons : composite steam vessels, to be not less than 2,500 will be required to give a bond, to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, with sureties in double tho amount of sworn cost, that they shall not engage in the coastwise trade between ports of the Uuited States." This bill is. as will be tionable than others of the free importation of ships is only to continue year, and only to apply to large-sized iron ships, for ocean service. But its principle, which In tends to throw overboard and give to the employers aud workmen of Great Britain, what ought to be given to those of America, is wrong. certain condi .

WHAT SHOULD Let Congress pass Mr. Lynch's bill, and build American iron ships, at such prices will insure fair competition for the world's co merce. Our workmen will have the money i their pockets, isstead of having it sent tho couutiy ; they will have the increased skill aud experience, in doing such work ; yards will be encouraged to expand and develop their capacity ; our employers will enjoy the profits, instead of foreign capitalists; and we shall have the proud satisfaction of seeing American Commerce restored, in American ships built by American artisans. This will add security against war, by increasing ability to defend ourselvei will be a substantial benefit of s on the sea, and it t to ship-builders, national interests, sliip-ow national pride, cry out agaiust missing tiiis excellent opportunity of achieving portant a result. . Our The Bailey Case. JUDGE I'AXSON . HAILEY, HUILAI In Philadelphia,Wednesday, Judge Paxsott de livered his opinion iu the case of desertion char ged by Mrs. Bailey, against Surgeon Bailey, of this city, it having been argued on the question of jurisdiction. Judge Paxson ruled that Mrs. Bailey could not for desertion iu Philadelphia,her residence be ing that of her husband, which was proved to be Wilmington; and that the desertion did not take plaoe within the jurisdiction of his Court. He therefore dismissed the case argued. As,however, Mrs. Bailey's counsel had also commenced other proceedings against the Doctor, under a law of Pennsylvania, which, as Judge P states, "seems to create a distinct offence,to it, that of desertion, which may be committed jurisdiction, whether tho parties are lore or not," he also gave liis opinion DECISION Fl ilia domiciled bore tho latter proceeding,and action upon it.

FEARS Special Correspondence of the Commercial. Philadelphia, Dec. 9. I observe that you mentiou in tho Commercial, the fact that the pending election, in District, will settle the question of supremacy hi the State Senate. Such is the fact, and the canvass is proportionately lively. The Democrats perniciously smart in nominating a gentleman, against whom personally there Finn really nothing be said, that the contest promises to be a very . Since my last letter the Republican convention has met and has nominated Mr. Jos. R. Lyndall, a well known and highly respected citizen. So the 1st District is likely, trict, to be handsomely represented how tho election may result. But that is not tho whole point. It is very important indeed that the Republicans should have this deciding vote. Matters of great iin before the Legislature this a Dis matter portance will winter, and ohr majority in the Assembly, and all consequent legislation, might be delayed if not entirely defeated by the wànt of a siugle voice in the Senate. The is a very peculiar d is exciting great attention. If I had the oldest inhabitant at my elbow I would get him to cudgel his brains for a similar state of things local politics, hut I doubt if even ho could ill n.'inernl'or Tlie Republican Convention was the scene of certain proceedings which wore a disgrace to the and we shall be served better than e if the results are not seen in a decreased vote for our candidate. Hucli doings might well be left to the Locofoco's. for "it is S a serv very their nature to." When we hear of riotings in Con ventions, of attempts at mob rule, etc., the im agination at once puts tho Unterritted in charge. The Unwashed liaa nothing whatever to do with this latest outrage however, for which Republi responsible. There is a disposition among tho pap æ 'iis matter quiet, "for the good of the « the phrase goes, but it is certaiu that er class of citizens dislike such subter S 3. Not after election, when interest in tilings tical dies away, but before is the time to strike at abuses. Right is right, and wrong is wrong. I for one would rather be defeated thau sail into power upon a gale of fraud and outrage. Not that the nomination of Mr. Lyndall was fraudu lent or outrageous. By no means. Our skirts clean so far. But the growing unscrupulous party managers calls for the severest rebuke. There scorns to be little difference be tween the way of doing things in our shop and in the shop over the way. That is what honest hate, and when they are further advised to to keep quiot and say nothing, some of them get mad. But, as "Ophelia" says, (with a trille more emphasis than that young lady usually gives)—"I hope all may be well." European steamship project which started swimmingly appears to be getting already into troubled water. Not that there is any real difficulty in the way, but that croakers choose to naturally exists. This of construction of 1 Mona In fa po ox The make trouble whore bugbear is the increased American ships, over those of English build,aud tho consequent inability to compete with the freight and passenger terms of foreig.« panics. This difficulty, if it is one at all, should be dismissed as something very superficial. The estimate presented at the citizens meeting, at the Exchange, for tho cost of these steamers, was about $400,000 for each ship. It is not p sible that they could be built on the Clyde for ) or 25 per cent, under this amount, shipbuilder myself, and you have a good many readers who are, yet I make this assertion with reasonable confidence, aud with as much assurance as though I had beeu born with a mallet in my hand, or at least,—for that last is a ridiculous idea,—if I had been born in a ship yard and had never left it on any pretence. And if our home-made vessels do cost this addi tional sum over those of British build, what then ? Could we not abundantly stand the added price ? Would not the groat advantage to the interests of Philadelphia aud the State make them cheap, even if the difference in price were double or treble what 1 have assumed it to be ? This is what Philadelphia engaged to do iu the matter : to furnish $300,000 of the entire pense of the enteqirise, the remaining portion to be contributed by the Pennsylvania Railroad ipany. Mr. McMichacl, in asking the ' ■■ if Philadelphia could furnish that amount, might well say, that he was ashamed to pro pound such a question. Very good. Could not a demand be made, then, for a half quarters of a million with bettor grace? If American built ships cost half a million. Phila delphia has only to increase her proportion of the expense by subscribing #700,090 instead of #300,000, and the tiling is done, monied iB necessary, I only hrv that such * y difficulty and place tho success of the scheme beyound question hand it would bo strange if with John O.

Tho "gUBhing" Kate Field made a bad failure at the Academy of Music, last night. The most hardened cynic could not have wished for any thing more complete. To most of the people present, however, it must have been painful. It must bo confessed that there was very littlo in tlie lecture, itself, (" Dickens" was the subject) but Miss Field rendered it additionally uninter esting, by her entire want of stage power. How the lady ever obtained tho soubriquet ot " gush ing," would be hard to say. Perhaps from the sentimental style of her writings ; certainly, from her manner on the platform. Olive Logan does indeed "gush," ana very pleasant the ex hibition is. Miss Field, on the contrary, ' gularly cold, angular, and feeble—to sum all— unattractive. There was nothing in hor lecture that any young lady of average intelligence t not have written. It fell on the audience the wettest of wet blankets.
