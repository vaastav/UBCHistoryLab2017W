'litis titno tho President's mossnge is dryer than a Inst year's almanac. Tor the most part it is a more summary of ^ departmental reports. It contains no ( striking thoughts and no important recommendations, except to urge Contress to pas* tho "Wilson tariff bill. This 'latter con hardly bo called im- f portant, becauao it has been expected as in the lino of what was understood to ^ bo tho administration policy. 'Jlio ad- ' miniitration was acquainted with tho bill in all it? derails before tho country aw it, and it cx;xno to tho country as an administration measure. There is littlo about Hawaii except a { promise to discuss tho Eubject in a special message. From this it is to be ! inferred that tho President desires to hear from Minister Willis beforo ho j. opens up tho battle with Congress, liis plans have miscarried, and beforo he discusses tho Hawaiian situation he desires to know just what it is. lit* makes plain, however, that he sent Minister Willis to restoro tho queon. ?j There aro some sensational remarks .1 about cabbatro seed, but tho country la will hardly become wildly excited on this subject. There is an absence of tho phraee-makinc which has marked most of Mj. Cleveland's public writings. s) Tho wholo document conveys the irn- P prossion that it was put together by a man who was tired while ho was doing 1,1 it Naturally tho kooncst interest is shown on tho tariff question. to President Cleveland wants the wage- n earners of this country to bo better fl housed, lietter clothod and better fed. ,, If ho wfll give thetn a chanco to get back fr where they were beioro ho and his party u jot into power tho wuge-earnera will be n, glad to lookout for themselves. A Discredited Policy. Two ?ocrotario3 of tho treasury under ol Mr. Cleveland in his first terra, .Mr. Manning and Mr. Fairchild. doclared t! strongly acainat ad valorem duties and ci in favor of specific duties as opening tho ei way to defraud the treasury. Chairman tl "Wilson declaros in favor oi ad valorem c< duties aud President Cleveland endorses cl liim. tc Tho McKinley tariff act makes uso of m both kinds oi duties, and while it has i: not caught tho importer every time it it hnn mailn it harder for him to ovado th? i customs duties and to rob tho American m producer of tho measure of protection which Congress intended ho should have. 01 P< The Van Alen Biifinoss. w Stang by the criticisms of his appoint- w ment as ambassador to Italy, Mr. J. J. \\ Van Alen gives up the job. Tho Presi- n dent did not feel tho disgrace ot the U) thing, and having started in 0:1 tho tit wrong road, insisted that Mr. Van Alen should travel with him. In spito of tho President's urgent ap- *n peal Mr. Van Alen decliued to 1:0 to hid post. Ho deserves credit for accepting the first opportunity to do his country- c'' mon a service. Mr. Van Alon shows to vory much bettor advantage than tho President, Who has not appreciated the gross iui- jr, propriety of selling a diplomatic place. jH Mr. Van Alen has riven him something ?> to think about. Tho public has given ^ liim more. Prksipknt Ci.evei.anp lira's Congress *r to make hasto to invite more imported wares into the Americau market, so as ea to givo more employment and more fi| wages to tho Americans who mako the do same kinds of commodities, when they th have the chance. This is statosmar- 0f ship?of its kind. A Volco From Knglutul. "While tho President and his party t|, are doing what they can to fasten on j? this countrr tho British taritr system, .1 th iiystem of taritr-for-revenuc-only, there is in Great Britain a growing and verypositive sentiment in favor ot a return th to th? system of protection to home in- ho slustries. th A writer in the London Xtus says Pr that ii tho British sovornvaont will put a duty on foreign products so as to pro- ee( test homo industries, it will accomplish c]( at onco what all t'ho committees for the th unemployed can never accomplish, lieaides the wage*arners, this writer notes tho fact that purchases of foreign coinmodities are driving to ruin tradesmen, shopkeepers and manufacturers. ho As Great Britain impose* on tobacco, cicara and spirits a duty o: 800 per rout, j ho would have a duty equally high put ' ^ | on all foreign commodities t. ;.'!ve the British producor a chance to live.

Whoever :: h a tasto for rtatistical iblei may easily verify this'staloment [ fact.

Tiik Prosident ur^es "local 'interosts" give way and let the Wilson tariff II pass. There are mo many of those terests that they stand for the whole nntry. If they will stand up for the 'end and butter of the people thoy can feat that unfair and impolitic measure.

Certainly, Mr. President, it why not proceed to expose them? charge of fraud is not an exposure of ;iud.
