Speaker Henderson will probably never enjoy a prouder moment than when he was escorted to the Speaker's chair, having been elected to the high est political honor that a foreign born American can attain, by the unanimous vote of ids republican colleagues of the House, amid the applause of members and of the crowded galleries—the Am erican who would not be proud of such an honor doesn’t live. The other olfi cers of the House elected were Alexan der McDowell, of Pennsylvania. Clerk; Henry C'asson, of Wisconsin, Sergeant at Arms; W. J. Glenn, of New York, Door-keeper; Joseph C. McElroy, of Ohio, Postmaster, and Rev. Henry M. C'uuJen. of Michigan, Chaplain. With the exception of Mr. Casson, who suc ceeded B. F. Russell, of Missouri, these are the officers of the last House, im mediately alter the swearing in of the members, near the close of which the democrats created a little flurry by op posing the carrying out of the republi can plan for dealing with the Roberts case, the death of Vice President Ho bart was announced, and the House ad journed, it having been previously un derstood that the President would withhold his annual message until Tues day. The first session of the Senate of the Fifty-Sixth Congress was much briefer than that of the House, and from a spectator’s point of view, much less in teresting. Senator Frye, President pro tempore, called the Senate to order, and after praver by the Chaplain, and the swearing in of new Senators, the death of the late Vice President was announced, and a motion to adjourn was adopted. But if the opening day of Congress was comparatively tame, there are plenty of indications that lively days in both House and Senate will he numerous during the session. From the minute that a conference of republican members ol the House de cided that Mr. Brigham H. Roberts was ineligible to membership in that body, his fate was settled. It is not a party question, but with the certainty that the solid republican vote would lie cast in support of the report of the special committee which Speaker Henderson has appointed to consider the case, it became immaterial what the minority would do. Asa matter of fact, two thirds of the democrats—possibly more —are likely to vote with the republi cans, against Roberts, when the test comes—they are afraid to do anything else. It was the women of the country who brought about this result. It did not require any argu nents on the part of the prominent lawyers sent to Wash ton, by the Social Service League, to convince the Representatives; they had been convinced at home be r ore they came to Washington, that to allow Roberts to sit in the House, would be an insult to American womanhood. Secretary Hitchcock, Assistant Secre tary Davis, Pension Commissioner Ev ans. and Assistant Commissioner Dav enport, all of whom are specially quali fied by their official duties to speak authoritatively on the subject, testified before Senators Gallinger and Hans brongh, sitting as a sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Pensions, to the necessity of a revision of the Unit ed States Pension laws, and tn favor of having the revision made by a non partisan commission. The Commander in Chief of the G. A. R. has been invit ed to submit Ins views in writing. The investigation is being made under the authority of a resolution offered by Senator Ilanshrough and adopted by the Senate, at the last session. Secre tary Hitchcock’s annual report, also strongly recommends revision and cod ification of the pension laws. In making a public denial of the re vived story of an alliance between this government and England and Ger many, or both, Secretary Hay took oc casion to express gratification—a grati fication that ought to be shared bv ev ery patriotic American, over the fact of our relations being more friendly than at any time in our history with all the nations of the world, and to ask pertinently, "And whv should it not be so? Everyone likes to be on good terms w ith the peaceable and prosperous, es pecially if their prosperity is of that nature that other people profit by it; and this is precisely our condition.” Representative Cannon, of 111., who had been credited by democrats with being opposed to the Republican Cau cus Committee’s financial bill, did not let the story get far before he squelch ed it by saying in his characteristically blunt way; “I heartily approve of the general policy of the bill. Now, if I was God, and was making a bill to be perfect in every wav. I wou'd probably change some of the details of the bill which lias been prepared, but I ap prove its general policy.” For the pur pose of allowing plenty of lime for dis cu-sion, the Financial bill was not taken up by the republican caucus which nominated House officers, and decided to readout the rules of the last House, but a special caucus w ill be held tomor row night, at which the hill will he taken up and, as a matter of course, approved, and arrangements will be made to have it passed bv the House, before the holiday recess. —Makes fat, blood, and muscles more rapidlv than any known remedy.

TIMES. Superior to Liverpool. Pioneer Press. Anew transportation company is an nounced in Chicago, the indirect in fluence of which is liable to be lar reachinc, if it is successful. It proposes to run a fine of boats from Chicago through to Montreal and possibly to Liverpool. Heretofore only boats of small tonnage have been able to pass through the Welland canal, but the widening and deepening of that water way has made feasible the use of much larger vessels. As the cost of trans ferring cargoes constitutes a large por tion of the cost of transportation the economy of vessels that can take their cargoes at the wharves of Chicago, Mil waukee or Superior and carry them through to Liverpool or any other Eur opean port without rehandling ought to have a decided influence on the cur rents of commerce. But t lie economy of vessels of large tonnage is so great in comparison with any that can go through the new Welland canal that there is no likelihood that the wharves of New York will rot away for lack of western business for some time to come. Yet the fact that it isseriously proposed not oulv to transport freight, but to carry passengers from the center of this continent to the ports of Europe in steamers as elegantly equipped as any on the lakes foreshadows the time, not so very remote in the fiuure, when even as a seaport, Chicago, and not im probably Superior, may vie with New York for first place. By the time the dream is realized of a w aterway of suffi cient depth and width to accommodate the largest sea-going vessels, the coun try for which Superior will be the port will he teeming with the millions that now crowd the states farther east. But just at present Superior and Duluth owe it to themselves and to the region they draw upon to open their own pathway to the docks and warehouses of Liverpool and Hamburg through the existing Canadian canals. This step forward will give an impulse to the movement for a deep waterway from the lakes to the ocean, which will gath er headway with every succeeding de cade until achieved. Greater under takings have been accomplished many times in the iast half-century than is involved in the dream of such a chan nel lor the commerce of the world, dif ficult and even stupendous as the en terprise now seems. Meantime, the enlarged Canadian canals open anew and cheaper outlet for the commerce of the northwest, which cannot fail to be of great ad vantage to the Twin Cities, as well as to Superior and Duluth. Columbia Calendar For 1900. The Columbia Desk Calendar, which has been regularly issued for the last fifteen years, by the I’ope Manufactur ing Company, Hartford, Connecticut, makers of Columbia bicycles, is now being distributed. The company will send the calendar to any address on re ceipt of five 2-cent stamps. This calendar is unique among pub lications of its kind. At the top of each of the :Kk> inner pages appears a para graph in prose or verse, furnished bv a coutiibutor; and those who have thus supplied the reading matter for the compilation include cyclists in nearly every country of the world. At the foot of each page are date lines, which, in clear and distinct type, denote the dav of the week, mouth and year. Be tween the opening paragraph and the date lines ample blank space is left for jotting down memoranda. The cover is artistically designed and handsomely printed in colors, and a two-color in troductory page informs the reader that the purpose of the calendar is to furn ish a convenient memoranda pad, ar ranged according to the days of the year; and, incidentally, to supply guid ance to all seekers for information on the subject of duality in bicycles. The frame which holds the pad is arranged so that the calendar may be hung in any convenient location or placed upon the desk at any desired angle. For many years the Columbia calendar has been regarded as a fixture in thousands of homes and business otficee, and this century-issue will prove a valuable ad dition to ttie series. Send 1 hem to Bed With u Kiss. O mothers, so weary, discouraged. Worn out with the cares ot I lie day. You often grow cross and impatient. Complain of the noise and the play; For the day brings so many vexations, So many things going amiss; Hut. mothers, whatever may vex you. Send tin- children to bed with a kiss! The dear little feet wander often. Perhaps, from the pathway of right. The deal little hands find new mischief To try you from morning till night; Hut think of the desolate mothers Who'd give all the world for your bliss. And, as thanks for your infinite blessings, Send the children to bed with a kiss! For some day their noise will not vex you. The silence w ill hurt you far more; You will long for the sweet children voices. For a sweet childish face at the door. And to press a child's face to your bosom. You’d give all the world for just this; For the comfort 'twill bring you in sorrow, Send the children to bed with a kiss! # —Selected. Acceptance of Philippine Policy. It is one thing, of course, to support the government in a time of war, ami it is another thing to espouse the policy, in pursuance of which war has arisen, with enthusiasm and without misgiv ings. Surely few people well acquaint ed with the undertone of American sen timent would now sav that there is deep joy or gladness in the hearts of the people in consequence of our hav ing extended our sovereignty to the Philippine Islands. It is true that there are those who continue to say that this country is deletions with the fever of imperialism, but they are in error. The average American craves imperial dominion about as little as does the average Swiss. Nevertheless, it is the general conviction of the coun try that a sequence of events which hu man foresight could not control has thrown upon us the burden of estab lishing order in the Philippines, and of taking : pain's place there as sovereign in the meaning that international law attaches to that term. —From "The Progress of the World.” in the Ameri can Monthly Review of Reviews for December.

Lehigh Company Wins Two Cases. On Tuesday an order signed by Judge Parish was filed in the superior court, denying the motion for anew trial in the case of Osborne as administrator of the ite of William Kelly vs. the Le high V'e ley Coal Company. Some five years ago Kelley received injuries on defendant’s dock, from which he died. J. W. Osborne, as administrator of the estate, through his attorney, John Brennan, brought suit to recover dam ages lor the death of Mr. Kelley. A demurrer to the complaint was intro duced by the defendant. Judge Smith of the superior court held against the defendant. The case went to the su preme court wltere the rulings were re versed aud the case remanded for fur ther proceedings. Judge Parish was called in to try the case last June, and after hearing the evidence directed a verdict for the defendant. The plaint iff moved for anew trial and the argu ments were heard by Judge Parish in August last with the result that the mo tion was denied. Another damage case in which the same company figured as defendant was settled in the circuit court by Judge O’Neil on Tuesday morning. This case was that of Engstrom vs. Lehigh Valley Coal Cos. was injured on de fendant’s dock iu the fall of 18% hv a bucket of coal which dumped as it was being hoisted from the vessel, the con tents striking him on the head, causing injuries which lie claimed were perma nent.
