Senator Wright, colored, took the Stand a'ld proceeded te relate his experience io regard to being pot out or a first-class ear. He, after stating that If "President Buford is my brother. God help me," subniantlally said : " Wheu we got to Danville, ia North Carolina, [Greens? boro' he probably meant, aa Danville ks in Vir? ginia,] thc conductor came to the party and see? ing me, (the other colored mer/wcre very bright, end perhaps he thought they were white ) asked me if I knew where I was.

(Wright tuen re? lated the occurrence at Clover depot, when after considerable discussion three ni-n cam-.) "They took hold of rn? and I went out and travelled lu Washington In another car. When I readied Washington I had a little inore money than I had any use for, and 1 instituted Bait against the rail? road company. 1 told the conductor when he desired to put me out I wonld go ir tho other malea who Were in thc ladles' car, unoccupied by ladies, would also go, but I would not else, be? cause there waa thc civil Rights' bul, which al? lowed no distinction In regard lo color; but he ha l rae put out notwithstanding. Now, my hearers, Congress did poss a Civil RightH' bill, and I am goiugto tesl whether there is any virtue in lt or not; If lhere be none, let. us know lt. and then we'll appeal to Congress for prot on. (Ap? plause.] Asl have said, I intend to t- be mat? ter. If lt takes the last cent I have or ? - make. Why didn't the conductor put me out I.: North Carolina? Because he was afraid, knowing that it, like Sooth Carolina, where they don't make any dlstlncUon, was reconnu neted, and Virginia was not. There the Republicans have ?old them? selves ont lo a party which will deprive them or all their rights and Ubertle*." The speaker here concluded and retired amid applause. He spoke very pleasantly, and to Judge from his countenance and manner, I should Infer that he rather thought it "pleasant riding OB the raU"-In a second class ear.

[moa OUR OWN OORRISPONDENT.) Fi.ouinci, S. C., December 19. The most hopeful Indication of our imme? diate vicinity is that there ts nothing or especial interest to communicate. Through the timely action or our board or selectmen much stealing and selling ol stolen produce has becu dcleaied, os well as drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Indeed, the Township ol ?irani, which takes in this notable little city, ia the only one In which thc township Organum!iou seems to Itavo worked advantageously, and the readers ol Tun Nnwe here arc gratified by the qualifications which il hus expressed relative to thc practical operation of this law, so soon to be repealed. Respecting Tu? Nuws, which is becoming a pet lu I his section. I may be permitted to say. 'tKecp a little cool, and let UH bear those Ills we have," Ac. We leel as you do, but we think that policy may dictate a calmer expression respect i UK our sable legislators and executive rulers. State and National, who seem to bc afflicted with blindness in Ute eye that looks to, and deafness In Hie ear tnut hears, t hc wrougs of the respectable portion of our Stale aud sect io?. Thu murder of Lcirrand Dickson, a Domneratic father of an unworthy Radical legislator though he was, seems not so much tu excite our noble Governor as Mr. Robertson's losses by thc K. K. K., although Mr. R.'a losses (fj are amply restored by insurance, and Mr. Dickson's life cannot be restored. Rut we hear lt rumored thal a freeman of black skin wan found dead about the Same tune, and 1 suppose we may look for the State const able and posse, unless ll shall be lu tim? made lo ap? pear to his Rxcellent i'urlly thal negroes killed the uegro, ns seems to be thc case. In our immediate peace of profundity, wc arc only interrupted by Hie din of business, the occa? sional clamor of diuukeu freedmen, the ever "wakening" whistle of the locomotives. Hie falling of the pines, and the crying or the babies thal "Florence" wrote about The black Greek Factory ls agitated, and I learn a meeting of its directors took place yesterday at Dove's and the next meeting ls tn lake place here. Wo wish Ibis enterprise success, as we do all Southern enterprises. We have been paving freights to snd Hom the North on cotton and cot? ton goods, and giving our money to tho North lung enough, for raauuracturiug what wo can easily manufacture at home. Our people now begin to realize that they had better keep this money at home. Black Creek can spin and man? ufacture all Hie colton of South Carolina. Where thc Cheraw and Darlington Railroad crosses lt, 1 learn, Is a splendid natural site fur a factory. A little investment or capital ls needed, aud wny should not our people moro willingly pay the money Into this enterprise that they are now pay? ing in commissions, freights and profits for the transmission or their owq products to thc North, mid tbenee back to themselves In the fabrics we all bny f 1 cannot believe our Stale will longer stand in Its own light. If the North ls growing rich on the manufactures of our staple, why may wc not retain, at least, a part of this to onr own benefit? Let cs not s'.eep longer over our own Interests.
