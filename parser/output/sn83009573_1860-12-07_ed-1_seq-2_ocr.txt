BALTIMOB K. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1860 • 77/y* /, TIiIORE EXCHANGE ANNUAL lbttbk ,sheet Will be issued from this olliee on the Ist day of .Tannarv, 1861, (Tuesday.) It will be in form and general contents, similar to those which we have heretofore made up, and which wo have the best reason to believe, have given universal satisfac tion. We hazard nothing in sayiug that our com mercial reports are unequalled by those of any paper in tliis city in accuracy and completeness; and all the statistics of the trade and commerce of the city for the past year will be embodied in our better-sheet, in a condensed and interesting form, accompanied by appropriate remarks and explanations. At a time when political causes seem to indicate a closer business connection be tween Baltimore and the Southern and South western States, our merchants should avail them- selves of every- opportunity of advertising, not only their own business, but that of the whole city. An opportunity to accomplish both objects Aviit bo afforded by our Letter sheet, in Avhich all persons ordering twenty-five or more copies in advance, can have their busi ness card inserted without extra charge. Those who intend to make use of our sheet will please leave their orders, at their earliest convenience at our counting-room, or with our agent, Mr. lioltzman, who is authorized to receive them. I'rice per single copy, ."> cents. Our usual Weekly Kcvicw of the Baltimore mar kets, printed on letter sheet, will be ready for delivery from our counter this afternoon. Mer chants and others desirous of having their busi ness cards inserted, can be acoommodated by leaving their orders at the Counting-room during the dav. The proposition of Mr. GREEN, of Missouri, in the Senate, looking to the establishment of police along the line between the free and slave States, with a view to the preservation of the peace and the proper execution of the fugitive slave law. we regard as one cf the most important, in a practi cal point of view, which has yet been mtide for the purpose of composing the difficulties between the sections. Wc do not, of course, understand that gentleman's precise idea, but we have long entertained the opinion that a proper measure, of the kind indicated, is one of the best, in itself, and the least objectionable! that could be devised, to obviate the annoy" ances growing out of the reclamation of fugitive slaves. In this difficulty, as in most others, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It is far easier, more humane and politic, to in terpose an almost insurmountable barrier against the escape of slaves over the border, than to ar rest and restore them after that line has been crossed. The North has shown 110 genuine com ity for the negro. It rejects his citizenship on equal terms, and treats him so coldly and inhos pitably, that, were the ranks of its colored class not recruited by continual accessions from the pro lific South, they would soon be empty. Annihi lation is the sure fate of the negro in the free States; and it is only when he appears in the guise of a fugitive from the hated name of slavery, that the smallest interest can be excited in his fate. Under these circumstances it would be a real boon to the free States to keep all negroes out of their limits, but most especially so great and dangerous a cause ol disturbance, as 11 fugitive negro slave. We are among those who believe that any ef fectual and useful execution of the fugitive slave law in the free States is impossible. Tt isaground of just and serious complaint that the legal author ity of thsss States should lie lent to its nullifica tion in any form; but as a practical measure of re dress, it is and always will be ofsmall avail. Some of the Northern presses of influence, appreciating, we trust, the constitutional obligation, and at the same time despairing of a literal fulfilment of it, are proposing the substitution of compensation for llie value of the slave, instead of his surrender. The proposition in this shape is full of practical difficulties, and does not, as we have heretofore en deavored to point out, fully meet the difficulty. The pecuniary loss engendered by the escape of slaves is really an insignificant matter. The New York Times estimates the annual loss by the es cape of slaves at one million of dollars, viz : 1,000 fugitives at SI,OOO apiece. At the same rate the slaves of the South are worth about four Ihousntnl minimis of dollars, so that the annual 1033 does not amount to one-fortieth 0/one per rent, on the entire value of slave property—a percentage at which no self-respecting Fire Insurance Company would un derwrite a family vault in Greenmount Cemetery. If this were the whole story it would not be worth quarrelling about. The slave, or his value, or his total loss, would be an alternative of almost equal import. Hut it is not because th® negro i 3 not returned, but that the right to his return is denied, that the South complains. It is because there is no common understanding between the sections as to wiio is properly the man-stealer—the individual who runs away with the slave, or the one who runs after him. Now, we do not propose to discuss that question ourselves, and wish to prevent its further discussion by others. We as sume that there is such an institution as domestic African slavery in fifteen states of the Union, with laws and regulations of its own, as necessary for the preservation of that "peculiar institution'' as the laws of Massachusetts are for her favorite forms of society. We assume that the entire control of, and responsibility for this institution, whether good or had, rc3t within the States which tolerate it, and that the other States have solemnly agreed to respect that right ofcontrol, and do not share the responsibility. We assume, further, that if the North interferes with that right, there will be a rupture between tjio sections, and that the line between the slave and free States will thereafter become the bound ary of distinct governments. We assume all this, because we believe it is all too plain to admit of dispute. It therefore follows, thai if we are to re main together as one nation, this fugitive slave business, which has been a perpetual running sore, keeping the body politic in continual irritation, should, if possible, be healed up. Cure this, and you have almost restored the patient to health. The fugitive slave law has been tried, aud has not improved the matter, if it has not made it worse. The Northern papers say that the arrest of a fugitive in a quiet Northern community, with all the circum stances of which it is impossible to dive3t the act, makes more abolitionists than fifty BEECHEHS or GBEELEYS could do. If this is true—and we believe there is much truth in it—it is better that such ar rests should not be made; and not to make them, the necessity for making them should he avoided. In other words, the escape of slaves into the free States, so far as in the nature of the case it may he possible, ought to be prevented. We presume tba't this is one of the main objects of Senator GREEN'S "measure, and we have not the slightest doubt that, with proper details, it would not he difficult to frustrate at least nine out of ev ery ten attempts at evasion on the part of negro slaves. Our idea would include a police force,in part mounted, in the pay of the General Government, stationed upon the border, with a telegraph u'n'der its control along the entire boundary, connecting, of course, with Southern lines. Ily this means the running away of a slave would be known a long time in advance of bis arrival upon the border. Very little experience would give great efficiency to the force. All the agencies at present organ ized for facilitating the escape of slaves would soon he detected, broken up and punished. To guard against all abuse, there should be depots along the line, to which all parties who might be arrested for any cause should be brought by the police, and have their legal rights determined by a competent United States tribunal, which wo if Id be enabled to decide each ease with calmness and substantial justice, without fear of tumult or res cue. Without further elaboration, the idea strikes us as one eminently worthy of consideration by wise, conservative and humane people on both sides of the line. The North is, in the main, willing to observe its constitutional duty—at least, we trust so, or the case is hopeless—hut its feelings are aroused by the spectacle of a slave es caping from bondage, and upon an impulse which we can understand, it fails to do what it has pro mised. But if there were no fugitive, there would he no sympathy—no commotion—no denuncia tion of the South—no failure of pledged duty.— Now, let us look for a moment on the other side of the line. It were difficult to tell what practical evils to slaves have grown out of encouraging them to escape. The oDe first to abscond is generally the most worthless on the whole plantation—idle, in subordinate, in lot. He lesv.s 1.1, nd him the contented, orderly, imiuau,,.,, alio are well satisfied with their condition and/well treated What is the result? The master, in a moment of alarm or irritation, ships off every slave he has to the South, or becomes doubly jealous and suspi cious and exacting if be retains them. In all this transaction it is difficult to see any good, or not to perceive much evil. The whole institution is demoralized by its insecurity, and its bad points are developed into bold relief, while all its good ones are driven out of sight. This border police might be appropri ately charged with other duties, such as the protection of the Southern people against abolition emissaries and border raids. Ia an equal and quite a3 beneficial a degree, it would relieve the free border from Southern invasions which are almost as irritating and annoying. The passage of armed i odies of Southerners, in pursuit of slaves, into the free States, is a source of great disturbance. Thereshould be no necessity for sue A a thing. If the arrest of runaway negroes be a n<- cessary business, as we believe it is, it should be done in the most effectual, business-like, and least oflensive manner possible. The North complains of kidnapping, and justifies its personal liberty bills. A3 intended to guard against this offence. With a border police, kidnapping might be rendered im possible, and the rights of free blacks as effectually guarded as those of the whites. Of course, by the adoption of such a system, the South would not lose any of her Constitutional guaranties, for the return of fugitives; but-in the present temper of the times, if the necessity of enforcing them can be honorably avoided, we submit that it had bet ter be done. No man now doubts, we presume, that the Union is in imminent danger of dissolution. A revolu tion, not threatened, but already begun, is gather ing strength nnd headway, hour by hour. The time is big with dire portents, and the calamities which they prognosticate may overwhelm us at any moment. Men may differ about the causes whicli have brought us to our present condition, or about the propriety or practicability of the means by which wc may yet extricate ourselves from our perilous perplexities, but they can no longer deny that our position is a fearful one The}' cannot shut their eyes nnd fancy that the Republic still stands firm "from turret to founda tion stone," for they feel lhat its pillars are rocking in the storm, and they hear the tempest growing wilder and the land. The Union is in jeopardy, and nothing but prompt and decisive action on the part of the people can preserve it. South Carolina will, in all probability, have for mally withdrawn from the Confederacy before the expiration of a fortnight; and although the other cotton States may not immediately join her, they will speedily follow her example. The resolution of the South to secede is becoming more and more fixed, and the North manifests little disposition to recede from the point to which the triumphant Anti-Slavery party has brought it. It neither "of fers to repeal the unconstitutional acts of its Le gislature, nor to acquiesce in the decision of the Federal Courts. The President proposes no mode of settling the dispute between the two sections, and he intimates that we have nothing to expect from any exertions of his in the future. Congress has met, and its proceedings are regarded with fear rather than hope. Everything indicates that its members are much more embittered against each other than they were last winter, and we cannot look for any cordial co-operation between the re presentatives of the North and South. But even if, contrary to our anticipations, the harmony of the session should be unbroken, we have little right to rely on that body for such measures or counsels as can restore peace to the country, for it is an unfortunate truth, that there is scarcely a handful of men in Congress for whose capacity or patriotism the people have any respect whatever. It is highly improbable, therefore, that the Federal Congress will, if left to itself, be able to point out any practical way by which the impending revo lution shall be stayed. The Union is in fearful peril, and ihe federal authorities, unaided by the States themselves, are powerless to uphold it. The people of the States must come forward to the rescue of the Republic, and they must speak at once or it 3 fall is inevitable, if not near. They must prefer their demands, and say what they will concede before the momentous issues to he dealt with can be settled. In thi3 crisis the States which are in the greatest danger and those which are the most conservative should first lie heard. It is the singular lot of the border States to fall at one and the same time within both these classifications. It is incumbent on them, therefore, standing as they do between the more extreme parties of the North and South, to assume a prominent position in this controver sy. Bound by many ties to the people of both sec tions, the border States command the good wil' of both—and as they would necessarily suffer most in case of a collision between the seperated sections) they are entitled to the forbearance of both. Oc cupying a broad populous and ferlile strip of ter ritory, which stretches from the Atlantic to Ihe Mississippi, we are too powerful to be slighted by eitiier side, for the destinies of the North and South alike, are in a large measure, dependent on the action we may ultimately take. We may assume then, that our appeals would not be disregarded; and we might even indulge the hope, that, any compromise asked for by the border States, would be deemed reasonable and just in the North and satisfactory in the South. Conscious then of the fearful import of the approaching crisis, and of grave responsibility resting upon them in virtue of their position, Virginia ami Kentucky, have al ready indicated their intention of taking speedy steps to place themselves ia some proper and deci ded attitude, before the country. In all probabili ty, but a few weeks will have elapsed before these two States will have taken some joint or separate action, not in order to throw their Aveight immedi ately with the North or South,but for the purpose of making every patriotic and honest struggle for the preservation of the Union, so long as a hope of saving it remains. In the meantime, Maryland looks idly on. Not only has she remained quiet, but she has intimated her intention of refraining from Ml participation in a controversy in which her interest and her honor are alike involved.— She has influence with the North and the South, for she has the strongest and most intimate social and business relations with both sections, nnd still she declines to exercise that influence with either. Her position, too, is misunderstood, for her vote for Mr. 

BRECKINRIDGE was warmly hailed in the South a3 a proof of her sympathy with that section and her respect for its constitutional rights; and the late letter of Governor IIICKS is quoted in the North as evidence of her hostility to the Southern "traitors." But Maryland gives no sign of any movement which is calculated to re trieve her from a position which is now equivocal, and which will, in a few weeks, be disgraceful.— She lias nevertheless a duty to discharge which she cannot forego. Extremists on either side are clamorously urging their views, and if there ever was a time when temperate and prudent men should speak out bravely, it is noAv. If the more conservative States are silent, will not pasoion and prejudice decide the issue on which the existence of a great nation hangs? Maryland, as a State of known moderation and patriotism, should volun teer her counsel to the South, or at least seek a conference with the other border States. In con junction with Virginia and Kentucky, she may render services to the Republic not less honorable and needful than those she conferred upon it in ear lier days. At all events, she will be enabled, after advising with these two States, to understand more clearly her own position, and to prepare for the contingencies of the future. The voice of her people should go forth, through her Legislature, and immediate steps should be taken by her repre sentatives to place her in communication with those of her sister States, whose situation is simi lar to her own. It does not become her to see the Union threatened Avitbout making one loyal ef fort to avert the danger: nor can she, in justice to herself, suffer the storm- to break and find her alone nnd defenceless. She cannot afford to con fide her destinies to any one man's keeping in this trying crisis. She must utter her Avord of warn ing or remonstrance, Avhile the opportunity for good is her's; and we cannot but think that she will, before long, find some way of doing so.

TELEGRAPH TO ANNAPOLIS.— We are soon to have telegraphic communication with Annapolis. We learn from the Gazette that the poles on nearly the whole line from Annapolis to the Junction have been erected, and the wires are being rapidly put up. HOM.IDAY SritF.ET THEATRE.—We were pleased to see such a fine audience at Holliday Street Theatre last evening. The drama of the Dead Heart is fast becoming to be appreciated by our theatre goers. The artists have improved greatly since it 3 first presentation. The acting of Miss Alice Grey is warmly applauded, and deserves all the marks of approbation accorded it. We are also pleased to speak favorably of Mr. Howell, who appears in the character of the aged prisoner, and represents it to the life. MAPIOAN'S Clncos.—The people will go to seo Blondin. Front Street Theatre is crowded nightly by those who desire to witness the wonderful feats of the agile rope walker and excellent corps or ar tists engaged there with him. TOM THUMB. —Gen. TOM Thumb is visited by crowds of little folks, who are entertained by his representations of different characters. TIIR MESSAGE—HOW IT US RE CEIVED, We continue to give the comments of such of the infiuential journals of all parties received since our last issue: [From the. Boston Advertiser—Republican.] It is not possible for us at this moment to enter into any detailed examination of (lie I'resident's proposition. But we cannot avoid the duty of warning all, how they regard this as in any sense a compromise. A plan for settlement it may be, but not a compromise under which the contending parties mutually concede and forbear. The North is to recognize rights, either already conceded or not material to the great matter in dispute; it is also to recognize ttiat doctrine respecting the ter ritories, against which, and with the help of the better part of the South, it has contended for so many years; it is to abandon its ground totally and for ever, in deference to the violent demands of cer tain sectionalists, not we believe a majority of the South—to abandon it under compulsion and threats. To call this a compromise or a plan for reconciliation would be a misnomer. It is to be viewed and decided upon solely as a plan for the unconditional submission of one of the parties to the dispute—a submission which cotild hardly quench a single heart-burning, or do more than postpone a danger which it avoids, but does not overcome. | From the Newark (.V../.) Advertiser—Republican.] On the whole, Ave look in vain for anything re commended to be done by the South to help on the good work of conciliation, and the message must therefore be pronounced partial and one-sided. Sir. Buchanan can ex-pect nothing from his labored document for quieting the country, since ho has not laid the least foundation for requiring important concessions of one section of the Linioninanv cor responding equivalents to be expected of the other; and has, moreover, not proposed such concessions as will after all he satisfactory to the South. [From the Alexandria (fa) Sentinel. —Secession.] The arguments of Mr. liuehanan upon secession and coercion, wo still think, devour each other. "If a State has no right to secede, it Avould seem inevit able that the Federal Government has a right, by fair and necessary implication, to oppose and pre vent such secession by adequate force. If it be conceded that there is no right to employ this coer cion, the right to secede is thereby admitted, Avith all its rational and necessary corollaries. r From the Philadelphia Bulletin—Republican.] The message suggests no practicable remedy for our difficulties. It leaves us where Ave were, though in a less cheering position, because Ave are now convinced that the President is unable or unwilling to do anything to save the Union. Up to this time, the sanguine friends of the President had some hopes of him. These hopes he has himself ex tinguished. [From the Newark, ( X. J.) Mercury—Republican.) There is no point in issue before the American people, so far as slavery is concerned, upon which Abraham Lincoln does not entertain exactly oppo site opinions to James Buchanan, and we rejoice that the time is not far distant when we shall hear from the former the noble doctrines and principles which were taught by the earlier Presidents. [ From the New York Post—Republican ] Wc will now content ourselves with stating our conviction that neither the amendment proposed, nor any other that the South wilt ask, is likely to be adopted, unless coupled with a repeal of that clause of the Constitution which confers federal representation upon slave property. Until the owners of slave property are put upon tho same footing, politically, as the owners of any other kind of property,it is not worth while for the South to ask anv modification of the Constitution in be half of slavery, least of all such an express recog tion of the right of property in slaves as forms tho basis of the President's first proposed amendment. [From the Kew Tork Express —Pnien.] But, as the crisis that South Carolina is start ing. and other States are preparing to follow, is ra pidly coming to a head, and as the conflict to come must soon demonstrate whether this is a govern ment, or a mere rope of sand, it becomes a ques tion ol the highest importance to know what the Executive will do, or can do, in order to save the government, the existence of which, as a Govern ment, ho recognizes, and declares his duty to main tain. It will he perceived, from tho Message what lias been before stated in the Expre**, that the President himself has really little or no power, without the co operation of Congress. The acts of 1785 and of 1807 are of no more avail for this cri sis, than were those acts available for (ion. .lack son in 18.'!2-3. A state of things is now seen in South Carolina far more deplorable than then. No Federal authorities exists there to enforce tiie Fe deral laws. [ From the N. Y. Courier ami Enqttirer—Republican.] But let us not be misunderstood. It e are for saving tho Union. The llepublican party lias achieved a great victory and can well afford to be magnanimous; and there is nothing which can be asked of up, which, if it does not involve a sacrifice of principle, we will most cheerfully grant. Wipe out the unfriendly legislation of the North, modify the fugitive slave taw by rendering it more effective and less obnoxious, restore the Missouri Compro mise; pay liberally for every slave which a commu nity refuses to surrender, frown down and brand as traitors both abolitionists and disunionsts—in short, do anything and everything not incompatible with our principles and the principles of the Constitu tion, to preserve the Union; but preserve the Consti tution a s it is. t From the Petersburg, Ya., Intelligencer ] We have read the annual message of the Presi dent, and find in his treatment of the perilous rela tions existing between the different sec tions of tho country much to commend. — The South do not feel aggrieved at any particular acts of hostility towards their peculiar institutions, but at tho auimus, which at the bottom underlies Northern sentiment and Northern action.

PRAYER OF REV. THOMAS 11. STOCKTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. The opening of the second session of the Thirty sixth Congress was signalized by unusual solemnity. The galleries were crowded, and a large majority of members were present. Mr. Speaker Penning ton appeared at the Clerk's desk, accompanied by the venerable Mr. Stockton, of Philadelphia, Chaplain of the House, who rose and pronounced the following impressive prayer with a tone and a manner which I cannot describe. His white hair and almost ghostly appearance made him look like a messenger sent from the other world. lie seemed to regard the men before him like mortals as they arc, and to have risen above the tempests of party faction and hatred. He spoke as if he had been inspired to speak by the Deity. He recognized no divisions, no sections, but one country, and in his discription of the blessings of the Union his whole soul trembled on his lips, and his appeal filled many an eye with tears. There was no caviling, no complaint. Even those who stood before him, intent on tearing down the Republic, were doubt less appalled at the awful task they were contem plating, and could not reproach the minister of God when he prayed for tho continuance of tho blessings of free government on this hemisphere : O, Thou, who hearest prayer! unto Thee shall all flesh come. Unto Thee we come, trusting in the atonement of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, and in the sanctifying influence of Thy holy Spirit. Thine is the help of man. Oh! Thou art our ref uge and our trust—a very present help in time of trouble 1 Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made' heaven and earth. Happy is that people in such a case, yea happy is the people whose God is the Lord. We remember the past, and we are greateful for the past. We thank Thee for the discovery of this new world; we thank Thee for the colonization of our own part of it; we thank Thee for the establishment of our national independence; we thank Thee for the organization of our National Unionjwe thank The® for all the blessings we have enjoyed within this Union—national blessings, civil blessings, social blessings, spiritual blessings, all kinds of blessings, unspeakably great and precious blessings, such blessings as were never enjoyed by any other people since the world began. And now, Oii Lord our God ! we offer unto Thee our humble praver for the present, and for all the future. Will it please Thee, for Christ's sake,to grant Thy special aid. Thou art very high and lifted up. Thou lookest down upon our whole land, from the lakes to the gulf, from sea to sea, from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof, and Thou know est all our interests, and Thou knowest all our dangers. Our good men are at fault—our wise men are at fault. In the North and in the South, in the East and in the West, everywhere they are at fault. We know not what it is best for us to do, and, with common consent, we come unto Thee, O Lord, our God! and we pray Thee to overrule unreasonable, wicked men, in all parts of our Confederacy. And we pray Thee to inspire, and to strengthen, and to assist all (rue patriots in every part of our Union. And may Thy blessing rest upon all the depart ments of the Government. We remember with special solicitude the President of these United States and his immediate advisers. They lack wis dom. But if they call upon Thee, Thou wilt give them wisdom, for Thou givestto all men liberally and upraideth none. While we trust they pray for themselves, we hero also pray for them, that Thy holy spirit may be granted unto them, and that they may see exactly what they ought to do and have grace to do it, in the positions in which they are placed. We thank Thee for this bright and beautiful morning for the assembling of the two bouses of Congress; and we pray that Thy blessing may rest upon the Vice President and upon every Senator in his place,land upon the Speaker of this House, and upon every member in his place. We rejoice to learn that they their responsibility, that they feel their responsibility, and that many of them are looking to Thee for counsel and direction. O Lord our God I let Thine own presence subdue every heart and every mind, and sanctify all ac tion to Thy own glory, and the good of our whole people. Oh! that we may still be happy in this blessed Union. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. A NF.W 

YORK JOURNAL, of yesterday, says: The greatest hardship prevails here among naval offi cers, sailors, sailors' wives, and others, owing to the non-arrival of the usual monthly money from the Treasury. Officers havo been insulted by butchers, grocers, tailors, &c.; sailors are daily re buffed by hungry land sharks and sutlers; and poor women, "whose husbands, away on the ocean, have left tbein half pay, are suffering fearfully because of their inability to fulfill their pecuniary obliga tions. No pen can adequately describe the wretchedness which even a week's delay of payment causes in the navy. The money for the Savannah's crew was received, and paid to them yesterday. ANOTHER PBIZE FIGHT. —A prize fight for SI,OOO took piace at North Benwick, Maine, on Tuesday, between Michael Fritz, of Providence, and Wm, O'.Veil, of Worcester. Sixty-three rounds were fought, occupying four hours twenty minutes, when Fritz was declared victor, owing to a foul blow. Nearly one hundred and fifty persons were present from Boston by special train. Neither party had ever fought in the ring before. Ex-Gov. Wise is now at Williamsburg, \ a., at* tending court there.

PIT-Ul JACKSON'S AUTOMATIC CAR BRAKE-J The accident yesterday on the Northern Central j Hail road, is only one of a series that have happ -lied on the , Railroads in this city, and they have all been attended with loss of l-fe or property, or both. The accidtnt of yesterday could not have happened, had the train been fitted with my 1 "Automatic Brak a ." As its operation is so well known to * our scientific and mechanical residents, I ned net enter into any d-tails thereof. To the Baltimore and Ohio Railioad I fl/st offered my Brake, and under an order from the Committee to whom it was referred, by direction of Ilenr.v Tyson, E-q., Master of Machinery, I applied it to a car of the Ellicot's Mills train, with the understanding that if my Brake faikil, I was t nay the expense of the trial. The Brake was tried and met the approbation of all the parties in charge of it, as also of the officers of the road. 1 was released, owing to its Miccess, from the bill of expenses, and had the satisfaction of getting a certificate o? its entire success. The Brake was sub equentiy taken off, although with one-fifth of mv power applied, it stopred a tan in I? 0 feet, running 11 miles per hour. To the Notliern Central Railroad J also offered the Brake. They never noticed ray offer, although their Master of Machinery said it deserved atri<?l at least. To the principal managing partner of our City Railroad, I wrote HS follow*: "That you permit me. AT MY OWN EXPENSE, to have my Bake fitted on the .first car that is ready for the road. If the Brake is then acceptable to you, you can retain it on the ta~. If th rt Brake is objectionable, 1 will have it taken off. and forfeit s*o to pay you for the time lost in changing it " To this c.tfer I never received a reply!

TION OF THE POOR, November2Gth, 18>d. —The Managers with the Assistant Collectors are about to p-oceed to take up the usual annual collection for the benefit of the Poor in our midst. There were relieved by this Association du ring the Li>t year 3,158 families, comprising 10,579 p-rsons— of which number ,'9!t persons were in widows families; (seelast Annual Report, pp. P. Table Ist), 1.5-7 sick poor, and a large number of single sewing womm were also helped to the full extent of the Society's means. This As sociation has expended all its money; the balance in the treasury wVl\nol pay the appropriations for this present month, November; and the applications for help are be coming more and more numerous and urgent—many "f the most worthy class, suddenly cut off from their work by the present crisis, and wholly unprepared for the rigor* of the winter just upon them—-are looking to us for assistance. The Board therefore, wish to urge upon the Collectors the duty to canvass the Wards thoroughly , to give all an oppor tunity to contribute to the relief and comfort of the vittu otis, industrious, and sick poor of our city, and very re spectfully ask liberal contributions on the part of the charitable public.
