* r VOLUME VII.-NUMBER 1157. SIX DOLLARS A YEAR WASHINGTON. THE GEORGIA RILL PASSED RY TUE S EX ATE. Synopsl? of its Provision.?. . WASHINGTON", December 18. After an ail-night session of it, the Senate ?? bas deckled tlie Georgia matter, so far as that body is concerned. After a discussion of two hours and a quarter on the original bill reported by the Judiciary Committee after the amendment requiring thc ratification of the Fifteenth amend? ment had been adopted, the former was put to a vote at half-past 1 o'clock this morning, and car? ried by a largely increased majority. The vote, when called upon the final passage, stood, forty five to nine against it. PROVISIONS OF TUE BILL. The bill provides first, that immediately upon the passage of the act the Governor of Georgia ls required to Issue his proclamation calling upon aU ?he persons who were shown to have beeu inly elected mtm'ters of the Legislature by the proclamation o? General Meade, dated June 26th, 1868, to assemble together at the Statehouse, in Atlanta, on a day to be named by the Governor. When thc members of the original Legislature have assembled as prescribed, the greatest care is to be taken to see that no In?ligibles get among the faithful. To insure this result two oaths are required to be taken by the members before they ?will be allowed to take their seats In addition to * the one which they will have to talce to support the Constitution of the State and of the United States, and the same, when subscribed, must be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. The first of these oaths requires the members of thc Leg? islature to swear tkat they have never held any United State? office, never been a member of Congress or ?? member of any State Legislature, -or held any orllce whatever for the admlnlatra tlon of justice under any State government, which required them to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, and after? wards engaged In, or rendered any aid or cam fart to, the rebellion-except it wa? done lu con? sequence and by means of direct physical force or?ccepted and held any office under the govern? ment of the so-called Confederate States. The second oath requires the members to swear that they have been relieved of their political disabili? ties by an act of Congress. Those members who refuse to take the oath shall be regarded as ineli? gible, and shall not he allowed to take the scats they claim. Those members ineligible who may take these oaths falsely arc declared to be guilty of a felony, and shall be indicted and tried for the offence in the District Court of the United States." A NEW ORGANIZATION. After the Legislature has been thoroughly purged of all ineligible members, the eligible mern- I hera*8ball commence the "work of reorganizing i the two Houses by the election of officers. All the ? legislation of the last Legislature ls declared to be ] only provisional. To guard against a second ex- ..' pulsion of thc negroes the bill declares that the I Legislature shall not exclude any members of : that' body on account of their race or color. In ' order that the provisions of this may be properly i enforced, the President ls authorized to employ . tho military forces of the United States whenever 1 the Governor of thc State should think it necea- i aary to apply for them. By virtue of Morton's amendment the General Assembly is required to adopt the Fifteenth amendment to thc constitu? tion before the State shall be decided to be in thc ! Union or Its senators and representatives admit- I tad into Congress. , i lt ls thc general impression that the effect of l this bin will be to vacate all the state ?nices which I have been filled by mon elected or confirmed by i thc Legislature, and that there will have to bc a ' * new*division of the spoils. All the political acts ' of the present -Legislature are declared to be i swept away. ? TUE 

DILL TO EE CO ll ' A LAW. ' . When the House meets on onday, Untier will ' make a motion to take up thc bill and put it upon final passage without reference. Thia motion will < ho carried, and then the bill is to bc rushed I through thc House at* qunrtcr-horsc speed. But 1 Terr little time will h? {Wowed, for dcbatCj and ho j ! Democratic members will be allowed to obtain ? the 'floor except those who have not studied up 1 th? facts of thc case and are presumed to know ? . but little about the matter. A great deal of feeling is manifested here at the i indecent haste with which this important meas- I urd?as been acted upon by Congress, and es? pecially at the attempted action in the committee room this morning. The passage of the bill in j the House on Monday, however, is considered a foregone conclusion. The Idea upon which the ; - extremists are acting is to get the bill through the House on Monday, and then carry it to thc Presi? dent and get bis signature to it before Congress ; adjourns for the holidays, which it will do on Wednesday. By doing this they arc enabled to head off the, effects which the anticipated action i of thc Legislature wonld have had upon Congress if the matter was to be postponed until after the recess. .r SEWS AND GOSSIP BY HAIL. " A RigUt Smart Ch unce for a Row." : The Washington correspondent of thc Now 1 . York World writes : 1 It is Just possible that all matters sf mutual 1 concern between President Grant and Congress may not glide along so smoothly as has been ex? pected. The Idea that has got abroad, that thc , Congressional majority awaited the President's message as a dictum and are to abide by it as the < law, is a little abated. Western Cougressmeu < particularly-those of both parties-are generally loth to accept thc President's or Bout well's rec- 1 ommendations on the subject of finance. They say-these Western men-that the proposition to , continue the present heavy tariff and taxation is brutal or ridiculous, or both: that their con- ' stitucnts will consent to no such programme.- : Aud there ls a good deal of this kiud of talk among the Eastern men. The Committee of Ways and Means In the House are, it ls under? stood, of pretty much the same opluiou. and there is what a Westerner called to-day "a right smart chance of a row" In Congress on this question, between the Conservative Republicans and the advocates of big taxation and the monopolists, let aloue the Democrats. What thc latter have to d_>ls to watch events, and let the enemy engage, if They will, in a Kilkenny cat light among theiu ?. elves. The antagonism to some of the Presi? dentas views by several of the most Influential members of boin houses is not loud, but deep, . and will yet manifest itself. Such gentlemen say : "Are the President, his Cabinet, or Deluuo, the .n?s who are sent hereto make the laws, or the * anea Who are constituted to execute them f Are . they to- decide upou great legislative measures, such as the continuation or alteration of the tariff or the rates of internal taxation; or arc we i" Tl?e Franking Fraud. Tlie House Postal Committee bxs at last taken up the question of the abolition o? the franking privilege. A calculation of the public documents printed for the Fortieth Congress, shows that each mem? ber and senator had 3150 pounds of agricultural reports; 981 pounds of patent ottlce reports, and 1134 pounds ol Globes. Including smaller Items, each member had over four tons in weight to send out to the people, making an aggregate for both Houses of 300 members of about 1259 tons. If postage paid was on all the books at regular rates, it would cost $653 for each member. Esti? mating at liberal rates other postal matter, in eludlngdsjaeches made in Congress aud business af the people pertaining to legislation and to thc various departments, lt is believed that were full postage paid on every letter and document sent that it would reach $1000 per capita, or a total of from $180,000 to $300,000 per annum for senators and representatives. What it would cost the varioas departments to communicate with their subordinates is roughly estimated at $1000 per day, making a total postage on the business now franked about $700,000 per auuum. -Thc divorce laws ol Indiana are convenient in more ways than oue. A widow who held proper? ty under her husband's will, with thc privilege of transferring it while she remained single, married Jagaki. It happened, after that, that she wished to transfer the property. By advice of a lawyer, she went through a series of sham quarrels with her husband ia thc presence of the children; lu a short time applied lor a divorce ".1 tue ground o? compatibility ; the children swore to the continu? ai quarrel, and the couple were separated.

[FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] COLUMBIA, December IS. "UNDER TWO FLAGS." Thc first business disposed ofia tho Senate yesterday was a jeint resolution of the House providing that thc United States Hag should be hoisted over the Capitol building during the delib? erations of thc General Assembly. Rainey de? sired te know what had become or the fla^r nsed at thc last session; if thc resolution provided \9t the purchase of another flag, he was not certain that lie was in favor of concurring. Corbin fa? vored concurring, and thought that if thc State of South Carolina could not afford a new flag, "then it had " better sell out." Hoyt moved to amend thc resolution so that thera should be a State flag hoisted ov^r the Capitel building also. Jillson opposed the amend? ment, stating that he owed allegiance to only one [lag, and that was the stars and stripes. Corbin reminded the senators that they were represent? ing South Carolina, and should deliberate under the folds of her flag as well as under the flag of thc United States. Nash opposed thc amend? ment, and said he owed allegiance to the United Statesand its flag only; in fact, he was not pre? pared to acknowledge that South Carolina had a right to any flag at all. Maxwell thought that if Sash owed no allegiance to thc state he had bet? ter vacate his seat. Thc amendment was anally idoptcd, and thc resolution concurred in. "TOE BONE BILL," A.? thc "bill to grant to certain persons there? in named thc exclusive right to dig and mine m the beds of the navigable streams aud waters of thc State for phosphate rock and phos? phate deposits" is called, was brought up In the Senate yesterday. When thc bill was read the Irst time in thc Senate, it provided "that the State should grant to James H. Taylor, Anson W. Thayer, Charles C. Coe, George W. William?, Jo? seph R. Robertson, Edwin Platt, James Bridge, Jr., William Birnie, Edward Willis, Alex. R. Chlsolm, W. L. Bradley, and such other persons as they may associate with them, the exclusive right to dig and mine," Ac Thc bill was ordered to he printed, which was done, and brought Into the Senate chamber about last Tuesday raorniug. Since then some one wrote another bill with the head, cuacting clause and sections exactly like I ?he bill as first presented, with thc exception of a ,'cw additional names, aud scut thc manuscript io thc printers, where it was printed, and thc copies substituted foi those already in the Senate chamber. This morning, when the bill was called up, the copies were laid on the desks 5f the members. It provided "that the State or South carolina does hereby glvo^md grant unto the foUowing named persons, to wit: l>. T. Cor? am, D. H. ChambCI rm, James H. Taylor, Reuben romliuson, Anson W. Thayer, Timothy Hurley ['hartes C. Coe, John Bates, H. Montgomery, Stan icy G. Trott, George Sawyer, Ci P. Leslie, Jaine1* P. tx>w, George W. Williams, Joseph It. Robert ?on, Edwin Platt, James ?rjag^ jr., winiam mr tile, Edward Willis, Alex. R. Chlsolm, w. L Bradley, and such other persons as they may as? sociate with them, the righ to dig, mine," Ac Thc trick was soon observed, and considerable imuscmeut was thereby occasioned, but legislat? ing upon the false bill was commenced. A DENIAL. Leslie. Mr. Speaker, when 1 want to dig paos, phates, I'll order my name to bc put on a bill for that purpose, but 1 wish it to be understood that my name was placed upon this bill without my knowledge or consent. Corbin. My name is also on thc bill, I did nut authorize it, nor do I know how it happened, but I'll state that I am interested in the bill, for I want to sec it passed, because lt will bc of benefit to thc Sute. WANT OF CUEKK. Nash. Mr. Speaker, I haven't got thc cheek to rote for this bill, nor do I think the senators have; if they did vote for it they could not look their constituents in the face; perhaps thc four years men could vote for it. Let me look over these ?ames. Here ls D. T. Corbin and D. H. Chamber? lain; well, well; and James II. Taylor, I don't know him; and Reuben Tomlinson; well; Anson W. Thayer, I dou'l know him; and Tim Hurley, humph; Charles C. Coe and Johu Bates, 1 don't fcnow them; IL Montgomery, lt's a wonder they didn't put you down (C. W. Montgomery) Mr Speaker; Stanley G.

Don't you abuse these men, they ar? my constit? uents-laughter.J Well, 'tis a wonder they didn't pul a few more D. T. Co-bins. Ac, to whitewash the bill to pall thc wool over our eyes. I can't believe there's a senator here as has ?rot thc check, unless His the "?cnatur from Charleston" (Cor? bin)-Cor he's gol the worst of al!. Some of the senators waut to postpone the consideration of the bbl for a day or t wo. Well, I am opposed to it ; if we postpone ii the parties interested ia it -.vii1 come around hugging and kissing a .. feller," and [tell yeo, 1 don't like to he kissed by everybody, I can't stand lt. Leslie again tcok occasion to deny that he Knew of his name being on the bill, and said thal any one who as-^erted that he did I old a deliberate and wilful falsehood. He did not have au idea who did lt unless it was-[turning around ami look? ing at the Speaker of the Third House, Timothy Horley.) Douah'-son explained that these meu would have to go to a great deal of expense before they could even commence work, much less realize anything, aud he was in favor of giviug them a liberal charter. He wa?, however, in favor of poslpcnlug tuc further consideration of the sub? ject for the present. In order that thc matter might be more thoroughly investigated. Corbiu. The company is willing to pay what? ever is right; it ls organized upou a sound ami honest basis. All these reports and denuncia? tions in the papers reia'.ive to its being a huge mo? nopoly, depriving thc poor man of his food and swindling the State, "are simply-Injlvnous." They come from mea who are now stealing phos? phates by thc thousands of ions, and for which the State receives not jue cent. And uow, when a number or gentlemen organ Ute themselves iuto a company to dig for these phosphates, end pay the State for lt, a perfect howl is raised. This company is willing to pay whatever is right tor the privilege. Nash. I am not willing to -.'ive my vote : > grant I he exclusive right to u;"' phosphates Ju lids ?tate at forty ?eui:', cr a::y other price. Just thinker ii. il're's a company that wants todig exclusively tiiaii cf the : ivers, and ; ay only forty cents for each ton taken ont, v?'b?a there'd anion who has offered to pay thc State ?sooo for t privil?ge of digging lor twenty years in Hie Cc sawhatetiic Uiver alone. [Laughter.] After eome quibbling in regard to the tinief the postponement of thc consideration of thc bi it was decided to make it thc special order ? one o'clock on Tuesday next. ANOTHER PHOSPHATE DILL. In the House to-day, George M. Wella, pursua to notice, introduced a "bill to grant certain pt sous therein named '.he right to dig, mine ai remove from the beds of the navigable strcai: aud waters of South caroliua, phosphates at phospbatic deposits;" the provisions of which a similar to thc bill already before thc Senate, e ccpting that tlii?* provides that thc company stu give to the State forty cents for each ton of tl rock removed. The names 01 those desiring 1 corporation, as follows, arc also different : P.. Moses, Jr., Speaker of Hie House: R. ll. cain, cc omi: Senator IL G. Judd, of New York: Josht S.Mays, Robert Smalls, colored member; R. Donnldsou, senator; A. J. Ransler, colored mer ber; B. A. Boscmon, colored member; P. E. Ez kiel, colored member; R. B.

Je rey, colored member; Archibald McLeisl H.S. Taft, of Charleston; Rawson Ward, S. V Whitwell, of New York; Wm. Gurney, of Charle ton; George M. Wells, member; and Joseph I Jcnks, member. It is reported that thc object of those requeu? ing Incorporation in this bill is to kill thc Sanat blil, form a combination with some of thc sen. tors, get up a sort of compromise, and place th monopoly in the hands of the members of th Legislature and thc six outsiders whose name arc above given. This bill will pass the Roost which the other cannot do, and lt ls believed thu (since thc introduction of thc legislative mono; oly blTJflt has a very poor chance of pat sing tb Senate. imir.EKY AND cortr.t tTioN. There is a bill now waiting to l?c ma le a lal providing for the prevention of bribery and coi ruption. It is doubtful whether its provision will ever be enforced upon several members t the Legislature. The re is considerable talk ainon? several of thc members in regard to Bowen, wh promised them money to vote for the gold bi aud forgot to pay them. It Is known that Bowe: tooL aman into out- of thc committee rooms lb day before the bill passed thc House and oflerei him twenty-five dollars for every vote he secure? for the bill. He refuse?! to accept that or anodic bribe which was Offered. It ls freely asset te? that thirty-seven men were bribed, or which num ber two received one thousand dollars each, a fev two hundred dollars a piece, and the rest bribe varying from thirty-seven to ten dollars. Som two or three colored men express great'indigna lion against oue man because he demanded am received two thousand dollars, when, as they aj sert, he has hcen known to give only one dolla for a vote. It ls probable that I will lie able in i short time to furnish a list of those bribed am the amounts received. Several of thc senators drew up a prates against thc bill, and intended offering it In tri? Senate to-day, but the Governor persuaded them (or one of them at least) not to do it. It is reported hen- that lhere Is now runnim through thc press of a New York publishiiif house A work entitled, "The Secret History 0 thc Legislature of South Carolina in lSGS-'uo." lt will, as I am informed, give the name of cac! member who was bribed, what amount ho re eclved and for what object: also, brier sketches o the lives of the mora prominent one-i. Tiie aulhoi is known to only a few; to the public he will ix only "Asmodeus." The book win bc In pampliiei form, and be issued in the spring. It will bc, doubtless, very interesting, and win sell wei!. WHY fil'I'I'IN WAS NOT ADMITTED. it has been a sourse of considerable renarli that the Senate refused to admit L. !.. Gunin to a scat as senator from Abbeville County. There II a story in circulation which may account for lt. According to the report, lie "made no bones''ol telling the people of Abbeville that he intended, il this or that diiug bc offered, to use his Influence to get rid of ;he carpet-hag clemcni in the State, I tlo not vouch for the froth of tile story, bul ii it be true there's no wonder that he was kicked out of a seat In that body, where there is a large rep .rescutation of thc clement alluded to.

A number of colored people of Conimbia, willi :i view ol' ridding themselves of a debt on theil church,(thc African Methodist Episcopal Church,] have concluded to have a course or eight lectures, one to be delivered each Tuesday n'gut in (Jjc church, commencing next Tuesday night.

Oue or more of thc late contractors of the Blue Ridge Railroad gave a hop last night, which con? cluded, it is supposed, with a grand seventy-five thousand dollar walk around, the principal mem? bers being in the ring. lt was a grand success. There have been several hops and receptions since the General Assembly convened, to Which all or the while oiIi?'i-<s and Hie prominent White sena? tors and representatives were invited: but none who wore on their brows Hie dark hut; or their race. Some few or thc equality clement of thc colored people are very much dissatisfied at this a rrangemeut, andtalk about it considerably. FISHY.
