That President Roosevelt will send to congress a spec ial message advocating the passage of a ship subsidy measure at the present session was stated by several membets of the house today. It was said that t'.ie president had declared that the rec ommendation in his annual message was misunderstood. In that message he said that If it was found inexpedient to pass the senate bill, a measure should be passed to provide for a few lines to South Ameri can ports. He did not mean to mini- mimize the Importance of other fea tures of the bill, it Is said and now purpopes to correct any false impres sion that may have been gained by th house Xo decision as to the committee's attl;ude on shin subsidy was reached at the caucus of the Republican mem bers of the house committee on mer chant marine and fisheries held today. After discussing the amended Galling er bill the Republicans took no action, but decided to call a meeting of the commi'.tee for January 7. when a vote of the fu!l committee wljl be taken. It Is believed that President Roosevelt's wishes in the matter will have been communicated to the house before that time. The amendments to the bill drafted by Representative Orosvenor eliminate cargo subsidy entirely and limit the crovernment's aid to mail carrying ships to South America and the Orient. Kven wi'h these changes the members of the committee from the middle west do not favor the measure. HIS

Rival Shoo Dealers Clnsh Over Posses sion of Building at 705 Kansas Are. BO YOU TALK? Did you ever wish to talk to some one in another part of the city when circumstances would not permit your going to them? Then talk to them over W. E. Dreehsel this morning filed a suit against A. M. and-J. C: Payne for possession of the room now occupied by the Paynes as a shoe store at 705 Kansas avenue, and the suit which is brought in the city court may be long drawn out. The room has been oc cupied by the Payne firm for some thing like twenty years and a month or so ago they were notified by Black, the eastern owner of the property, that they would have to move as the prop erty had been rented to Dreehsel, an other shoe merchant. The building on. the corner of Sev enth street and Kansas avenue, which is now occupied by rechsel as a shoe store, was recently purchased by a firm which intends to remodel it and use it for its own use. - It is claimed by the Pavnes that Dreehsel then made a trip east and offered the owners of the property they occupy more rent than they are now paying and that their building was leased from under them by Dreehsel. Attorneys have been re tained by both sides and an interesting lawsuit will probably be the result of the entanglement of the business inter ests of the two firms. HE ATE A POHOIS PLASTER.
