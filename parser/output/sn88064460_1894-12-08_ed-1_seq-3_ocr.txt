These chie claims are not barred.

A gratifying or recognition of the uniform impartiality of this An country towards all foreign states was manl- sed tested by the coincident request of the Chinese the and Japanese governments that the govern- but tsaent of the United States should within proper got limits afford protection to the subjects of the per other during the suspension of diplomatic rela- of tions due to a state of war. This delicate office the was accepted, and a misapprehension which ata . ave rise to the belief that in afford- me 'ng this kindly unofficial protection mo our agents would exercise the same tio authority,which the withdrawn agents of the mil belligerents had exercised. was promptly cor- m rected. Although the war between China and agi Japan endangers no policy of the United nal States. it deserves our greatest consideration, th by reason of its disturbance of our growing Ar commercial interests in the two countries, and Afl the increased da..ers which may result to our bu citizens lomiciled or sojomrning in the interior est of China.

Rising the Colorado heights, tile stream flows SI7,1 intermittingiy, yielding little \aitter during the the y dry months to the irrigating channels already rived constructed along its course. This scarcity is sour( often severe:y felt in the regions Thi where the river forms a common amol boundary. JMoreover, the frequent changes than in its course through level sands often raise front embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdic- inter tion. Thb Prominent among the incidents of the year was was the tBluefneds incident'in whatis known as $28,61 the Mosquito Indian boundary on the Atlantic 411.7 Ocean and within the jurisdiction of Nicar- mast ragua. By the treaty of 18860 between Great to $8i Britain and Nicaragua the former government cedir expressly recognized the sovereignty of the lat- Th ter over the strip and a limited form ot self- fiscal government was guaranteed to the Mosquito durit Indians to be exercised according to their cus- ports toms for themselves and other dwellers ing within its limits. The socalled native :govern- were ment which g:ew to be largely made up of Th aliens for many years disputed the sovereignty suga of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the $1',11 s right to maintain therein a practically in- over dependent municipal government. Early In ing the past yaar the efforts of Nicaragua to main- from tain sovereignity over the Mosquito territory the led to serious disturbances, culminating in the oper suppression of the native government and the pens 1 attempted substitution of an impracticable upol composite administration in which the Nica- It ragua and alien residents were to participate. pres, I Failure was followed by an insurrection, which ernn a for the time subverted the Nicaragunn rule, ex- Jun opelling her officers and restoring the old pen organization. This in turn gave place of S to the existing local government es- Tt r tablished and upheld by Nicaragua, of r i although the alien interest arrayed against i2,24 e Nicaraugua in these transactions have been the largely American, and the commerce of that the n region for sometime has been, and still is, tion e chiefly control ed by our citizens, we cannot, hold - for that reason challenge the rightful soy- upo relgnty of Nicaragua over this important part the h of her domain. For some months one, and gold IS part of the time two of our naval ships have ver h been stattoned at Blueflelds for the protection $127 d of all legitimate interests of our citizens. In TI 11 September last, the government at Mana- of J 1s gua expelled from its territory twelve van g or more foreigners, including two purl s Americans for alleged participation in the tine 1- seditious or revolutionary movements against age e the republic at Blueflelds already mentioned; amt t- but through the earnest remonstrance of this tha or government the two Americans have been pur e permitted to return to peaceable management was a- of their business. Our naval commanders at 931,1 R the scene of these disturbances by their con- heir h atant exhibition of firmness and good judge- T 1- ment contributed largely to the prevention of coil in more serious consequences and to the restora- the Stion of quiet and order. I regret that in the $4x: Smidst of thtese occurrences there happened a nt r* most grave and iriitating failure of Nicar- nc aguan justice. An American citizen and named Wilson residing at Rama in coil n, the Mosquito territory, was murdered by one coil g Arguello, the acting governor of the town. last Id After some delay the murderer was arrested, ic Ir but so insecurely confined or guarded that he e or escaped, and notwithstanding our repeated de- )7T ur mands, it ais claimed that his recapture has been cut a impossible by reason of his flight beyond coi n- Nicaraguan jurisdiction. The Nicaraguan I )f- authorities having given notice of forfeiture of of xe their concession to the canal company on est se grounds nurely technical and not embraced in co a, the contract, having receded from that position. an >s- Peru, I regret to say. shows symptoms of or r- domestic disturbance, due possibly to the val st slowness of her recuperation from the dis- I us tresses of the war in 1881. Weakened in re- 189 n- sources, her difficulties in facing international St of obligations invite our kindly sympathy and am SI justify our forbearance in pressing long pend- w at ing claims. an The recent death of the czar of Russia called li g- forth the appropriate expressions of sor- of row and sympathy on the part of our o r;overnment with his bereaved fam- Tv iy and the Russian people. As we o- further demonstration of right and friend- to ed ship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed th to represent our government at the funeralea n ceremonies. The sealing iqteresta of Russia in en Behlring sea are second only to our own. A - a - modus vivendi has therefore been concluded it. with the imperial government, restrictive of t' , poaching on the Russialn rookerles of sealing in to waters which were not comprehended in the o0 or protected area defined in the Padris award. f Occasion has been found to urge upon the oh a Russian government equality of treatmentfor In Sour great life insurance companies whose opera- P to tions have been extended throughout Europe. P Admitting, as we do foreign corporations to an transact business in the "i.nited 5tates, we he naturally expect no less tolerance for our own ai of in the ample fields of competition abroad. But I yfew cases of interference with naturalized m citizens returning to Russia have been reported as during the current year. i The government of Sat Salvador having been overthrown by an abrupt popular outbreak, certain of iti military and civil officers, while hotl pursued by insurgents sought refuge on at board the United States war ship Bennington, on y then lying in aSalvadorean port. Although the ce t p aratice of asylum 1 not favored by this goee l ernment yet in view o the imminent pcri c of which threatened the fugitives and solely from a d considerations of humanity they were afforded ef cc' shelter by our naval commander and when tm ste afterwards demanded under our treaty of extra- at to dition with Salvador lor trial on charges of of of murder. arson and robbery, I b h directed that such of them as tl had not voluntarily left the ship be con-- m ve yedrto onteo our nearestports where a hear Ing could be had In compliance with the terms ofthe treaty. Ontheir arrival at San Fran l t cisco such a proceeding was promptly inotl ia tuted before the Uufted Sttes district judge, t see who held that the ascts constituting the alleged f Soffenses were politica and discharged all the tie accused except one Clenfuegos, who was held the o an attempt to murder. Thereupon I was Sconstrained to direct his release for the rearson le Sth at an attempt to murder was not one of the u crimes chsrged against him, and upon which g his surrender to the Salvsdoresal author itieses Srhad been demanded. is Unreasonable and unjust fines imposed by gee Spain on the vessels and commerce of the ¶ nited States. have demanded from time to the tine during the last twenty years, earnest re- d onostrance upon the part of our government. u he immediate past exorbitant penalties e a. , have ben jpose nDO outrvMdel,a~I dgas am for clerial erss ot th most trivial eharatet r ~ in the manifests or bills of lading.

The public land disposed of during o the act the year amounted to 1,040,610,077 acres, in- 1, of No chluding 2,F87,605 of Indian lands. S It is estimated that the public domain still dc 1, remaining amounts to a little over 600,003.0 0 forei averacres, excluding however, about 360.0 i00,000 on e total acres in Alaska as well as military reserva- be a e time tions and railroad and other selections of land seem i yet unadjudicated.

These cases numbering three or four i ci thousand annually, are sent by the local officers sae 3853143 to the commissioner of the general land office glo for his action. The exigencies of his other a S418t duties oblige him to act upon decisions of time e registers and receivers without an opportunity of thorough personal examination. Though the condition of the Indians show a wi steady and healthy progress, their situation is not satisfactory at alt points. Some of them to ined whom allotments of land have been made are 30 in found to be unable or disinclined to follow ninor agricultural pursuits or to otherwise beneficially manage their land. This is especially ales true of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes I of who, as it appears, by reports of their agent have in many instances never been located 1, upon their allotments and in some cases do not ai'oneven know where their allotments are. Their onag condition has deteriorated. They are not self-supporting and they live in camps and eult1 spend their lives in idleness. I have always nuleo believed that allotments of reservation lands to Indians in severalty should be made spar ingly, or at least slowly, and with the utmost caution. I am convinced that the proper solution of the Indian problem and the success of every idon step taken n that direction depends to a very $2on7 large extent upon the intelligence and honesty a. of the reservation agents and the interest they have in their work. being 4 The indications are that the detail of army Ing Th officers as Indian agents will result in improved The management of the reservations. I am not being only disposed to be very cautious in making al lotments. but I am inclined to agree with the ioed secretary of the interior in the opinion that when allotments are made the S balance of reservation land remaining after allotment instead of being bought by the gev i we ernment .Irom the Indians and opened for re settlement with such scandals and unfair prac corre- tices as seem unavoidable, should remain, for a time at least, as common land or be sold by the han government on behalf of the Indians in an Scc orderly way and at fixed prices to be deter me. mined by its location and desirability, and the that the proceeds, less expense, should be held ,as In trust for the benefit of the Indian pro prietors. The intelligent Indian school management of the pat year has been followed by gratifying results. Efforts have been made to advance ofwar the work in a sound and practical manner. 1'enslons, Al- At the close of the last fiscal year, June 30, ht in- 1894, there were 969,M4i persons on our pension r, the rolls, being a net increase of 1539 over the num to the ber reported at the end of t.he previous year. rough These pensioners may be classflied as follows: ting Soldiers and sailors, survivors of all wars, I dut 753.968; widows and relatives of deceased col-A ing at diers, 215,162; army nurses in the war of the re on of bellion. 414.
