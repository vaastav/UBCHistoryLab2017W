The east admits it and many of the papers say frankly that the policy of the east l oppose! to that of the went and that It Is self preservation that actuates the eastern members. , t , . . , Hut western men have after' all shown a great deal of aptitude in hold ing their own. The east opposed the reclamation service, yet the west se cured that benlflcent legislation. There are , always some men among the eastern memebers who may be de pended upon to do justice regardless of sectional consideration. .AsvJhe years go on'ft'wlli become 'easier for western WelTWUfv their way.

Where one acre of land la cultivated today, by the application of scientific methods of the senate were almost ' balanced, Warren showed that he dared not rtand for hla convlcttloni against a majority of bis party. This man from a neighboring west ern state admits that be believes Now Mexico should be admitted as a sep arate state, He knows there 'is a close light on. Many of bis republi can associates and all of the western men with one or two exceptions will have manhoo.1 and decency enough to vote for the separate admission of this territory. Warren will be brand ed all over the west as a poltroon and a weak loward, If he does violence to his convictions and vote against jus- Ltlce to this territory because an east- em, faction of his party happens to want him to,. .

The Judge' will hardly deny that his taxes for 1905 are certainly not higher, In dollar and cents that he would have to pay had ho remained In hia native state of Tennessee! nor that some of the big cattle outfits in the lower Pe cos Valley would have to whack up much more handsomely In other com monwealths than they do In New Mex ico. He can scarcely have overlooked the recent census bulletin which showed that the railroad lines In Maw Mexico are assessed less than ten per cent on their -commercial walue al though the assessed valuation In other ; states, Including Tennessee, ranges from 40 to 120 per cent and (axes must be paid accordingly;, nor will Judge Freeman deny that the valuation of other property in this Territory Is less than one-third on the average of Its true value and that the' per capita expenses of the Territory of vNew Mexico are less than the 'per capita exepnues or tne state or Pen nsylvania, or the state of Colorado, or the state of Tennessee.
