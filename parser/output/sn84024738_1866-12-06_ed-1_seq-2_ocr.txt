One of the sensation correspondents of w I ho Now York UwnUl states that thte mes sage of the President as sent to Co"*?** is very different from the one which he originally prepared ; that he had intended to propose a compromise with Congress but, upon learning the teni|>er of the mem bers determined to adhere to his original position. How much truth there is in this statement, we know not. It is, however, we think, evident that in discussing the restoration quest ion the Presiecnt was * arcful to use no language which could justly otlend his bitter enemies in the two Houses. A special telegram in the Balti more Sun says that 41 the even temi>er of " the President's message is having an ex 44 eellcnt effect, not in behalf of concilia 41 tion, but in behalf of the dignity and 44 self-respect of the House as a legislative 44 body." And the debates in the Senate upon several questions which have arisen indicate that that body may perhaps be expected to l?c less radical in its measures than Stkyfxs's and Forney's threats have led us to fear it would l>e. The yatioiuil l{qvtl>Hcan declares that ac cording to the official reports of the pro. eccdings of the Senate and the House on Monday, Sumner and Stkvkns 41 were discarded as leaders;" that "their 44 lead was squarely declined by a vote of "both Houses? Simxkr on suffrage in the 44 District, and Stkvkns in his attempt to "prevent the reading ofthe message." This assumption, however, is hardly warranted by the facts stated ; for both Stkvkns and Si M\F.n were outvoted at the last session ui>on several questions, yet the radicalism of Congress was none The less manifest in its measures. Stkvkns did not approve of the constitutional amendment, although lie introduced it and voted for it : and Si mner was left in th? minority upon the question i>l" the admission of Colorado into the Union. The tone of the northern press indicates that the message has had a mollifying ef fect upon some at least of the Radical fac tion. The Philadelphia lnquirtr (Radical) says 44 that the President has written with 44 candor and dignity, and with the utmost 41 respect to Congress. It is to be hoped 44 that this judicious policy will have itsef 44 feet upon members of Congress, and that 44 whatever may be done contrary to the 44 views ofthe President will be transacted 44 with calmness, and without asperity or 14 passion." The Philadelphia Bulletin (Ra dical) says it is "gratified with the mode* 4' ration, and w\'? ihe respectful tone which 44 he maintains towards the 4 coordinate 44 branches of the Government.' " The New York Tintc, which is now Radical, applauds the President's "good temper," but not his 44 good taste." The Tribune counsels kindnes>, patience, and charity, though it sees nothing in the message which 44 any loyal man can read with comfort or hope." The National Inttlliymcer says : 44 We are under no apprehensions about 44 Congress territorializing the South." Governor Pkirpoint assures us in his mes sage that however it may be with the other States, Virginia is iti no danger of being bubjected to this har>h treatment. But the resolution passed by Congress includes Virginia in tlio of States for which it is proposed to establish territorial govern ments. It must be confessed that, to take the most hopeful view of the situation, our political condition is a deplorable one. The Richmond Examiner. ? When, in a playful, but respectful manner, we replied to a general attack of the Richmond amincr upon the other journals of this city ? inferentially charging them with a want of frankness or manliness for not following in the Examiner's wake in protesting against the Pollard .'prospectus,- we were alto gether respectful to that paper. In the Kcaminer's retort upon the lJiapatch for this very fair hit at its egotism it essays to disparage this paper and to attach to it a reputation entirely undeserved. The sub terfuge is contemptible. The Richmond Eclectic.? The Decern I'd number is upon our table. The table of contents is inviting. Price, lour dollars a year.

Colonel Lewis reported the following communication from the Governor, which was laid before the House : Tut: Commonwealth ok Virginia, } Executive Department, > Rich mono, December f?, 1866. ) To the Senate and House oj Dtkjaie# of\ Virginia : . Gentlemen, ? Last summer I received a verbal communication from Kandoli Rogers, Esq., the contractor for furnishing statuary for the Washington monument. A ft e i my annual message was placed m ho hands of the printer, I received the lol lowing letter : Rome, November 10, 1F<?6. To lilt Escellcncy F. 11- rierpoint, Go vernor of the State of Virginia: c:r Atlcr a lapse of more than five years', I 'again take up my pen to write to the Governor of Virginia on tho subject of tho Washington monument, the comple tion of which, after the death of Mi. Crawford, was entrusted t-? me, and a eon tract entered into between the ot'ite ot Virginia and myself. I now write for the purpose of stating the position ot the case, and the condition ot the work. Ms last letter to the commissioners | belore the war was dated March ith, K Ol. stated that I had just received a let er from Miller, the bronze founder at M - nicli, stating that the statue ot M^sha} had been completed in bronze, and >\ould be forwarded to Rotterdam without de a>, and that the Nelson was M*r\y and that the Lewis would be readj lor shipping before the 1st of July; also, that two of the allegorical statues, tutli mili tary trophies, had been for several months in the hands of bronze founders, and I l?e lieved they were well advanced. 1 can now sav that the statue ol Marshall was forwarded to Rotterdam, as above stated and upon which 1 have all this time been pajing heavy storage and insurance. At the time tho statue arrived in Rot terdam the aspect of political maUers looked so threatening that 1 was ads r>ul not to send it forward, tor fear of sei/.mt xnd confiscation. The statues of Nelson md Lewis have been finished and packed, ready tor .hipping, ever since the summer of 1M?1.

In payment of the Jt'319, Miller allowed me to send lor.vard the statue of Marshall, which has been so long lying at Hotter dam, and would be willing to send for ward the others, could I fix upon a certain tiiue when he could receive the balance. 1 do uot ask the State of Virginia to pay anything more until the works arc received iu Richmond as per contract, but I must know that the money will be forthcoming when the works are delivered ; otherwise I shall make a bad figure with my credi tors.
