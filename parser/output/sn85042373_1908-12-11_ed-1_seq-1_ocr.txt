Representative Perkins of New York introduced a resolution which was heretofore agreed upon provid ing for the appointment of a special committee of five members to consider the proper means of dealing with that portion of the president's message which criticises the course of con gress In prohibiting the detail of se cret service men to duty outside of their own bureau. The resolution is preceded by a preamble reciting some expressions of the message. No eN torts were made to give voice to the feelings of the house. In presenting the resolution Perkins made a brief •tiatement saying that he was satis fied that the house would not hesitate to take such action as the dignity of that body required. He said that some of the president's expressions Were unfortunate. The resolution was adopted and Messrs. Perkins of New York, Denby of Michigan, Weeks of Massachusetts, Williams of Mississip pi and Lloyd or Missouri were ap pointed on the committee Indications point. to non-action by the senate on the message until after the house special committee has had the opportunity to Investigate the. en tire matter. A number of Democratic senators have had informal confer ences concerning the language used by the president and as a result Sen ator Culberson, the minority leader today consulted with Senator HaleV the new Republican leader. Senator Culberson took the position that the message could not be Ignored and sug gested that the portion relating to the secret service be referred to the senate committee on appropriations, for an Investigation of the operation of the amendment concerning tft® se cret service, which was made by the sundry civil bill last 'year. He pro posed also that this committee should consider the recommendation of the president for the restoration of the old law. It was his opinion that such action would carry with it an investi gation of the language used by the president although It was not his In tention that any resolution to be of fered should refer specifically to that language. the Democratic senators favor ac tion by the Republicans, but it was intimated that If the majority party should be Inclined to ignore the mat ter, a resolution would come from the Democratic side of the chamber. At the same time they expressed the opinion that this should not be made one of party controversy and •howed a disposition not to debate any proposition which might be ad vanced from the Republican side. At a conference held during the day at the senate end of the capitol, there were a number of Republican Senators present who have always bean ready to defend any criticism made of the president. They announc ed their decided opposition to sug gfMtions which had been made that all tftit part of •Jii %mW the president's message, which .has given offense should he ex punged from the record. At the same time, they announced that they would not oppose any. resolution providing for an Investigation by the appropria tions committee to the amendment adopted last year.

GANNON OPPOSES S^aker 'jiTei la Favor of Waterway Improvement Bonds Washington, Dec. 11—Speaker Can non today made known his unalter able opposition to the proposition of financing hiational waterway improve ments by the issuance of government bonds In a characteristic address to the delegates attending the rivers and harbors congress. His position in regard to (he bond issue scheme was made clear when he declared that "If perchance it were possible, and I do not believe It Is possible, the rivers and harbors com mittee should report a bill to con gress providing thai there should be an Issue for the next ten years to meet the proposed improvement bonds in the atriount of $1,000,000,000, I would not vote for it.". The pronouncement of Speaker Can non cast. a. gloom over the congress as the advocates of the bond Issue had strong hopes of favorable considera tion of their proposition at the hands of the federal congress. Mr. Cannon's attitude Is it variance with that held by Vice President Fairbanks, Andrew Carnegie and others, as expressed be fore the rivers and harbors congress yesterday. "Now, nobody wants the federal congress in the next six days to. commit- an expenditure of $20,000, 000,000 for waterways and to issue bonds,' said Mr. Cannon. "If it is necessary, and great works are neces sary in peace and war, to issue bonds, I stand ready to issue bonds. But ex penditures must be. safe and sane. I do not want this work or any other work to be done except it be done safely and sanely." The spsaker, however, declared that he would Vote for appropriations re ported by the rivers and harbors com mittee under the leadership of Rep resentative Burton, who, he said, has done more service and better service along waterways improvement than any other man in congress. The address of Speaker Cannon was easily the feature of the day's pro ceedings. In picturesque language driving home, a point here and theie with,some apropos story, "Uncle Joe' delivered what might be termed/ a "heart to heart'' talk. Declaring: at the outset that he wanted to be frank with the delegates, the speaker pointed out that if the delegates should be disappointed In the action of the federal congress, "you at least,? he said, "will not:have to say that' one representative in the house lied to .you." In explanations of his opposition to the bond Issue scheme, Mr. Cannon ssild it waa becauae such legislation would beget that kind* of a combina tion that would put great quantities Of Hi advised projects upon tfre country and that there would be a serious ac counting therefore later on. Speaker Cannon -told Of voting for a rlver and harbor bill over the veto of President Arthur in 1888 and de clared that he had no doubt that soma oflhoee who tried to stamp the life out of his political body for voting'tor that hill would say that "I am a re actionary that I am a sort of fly-In the-olntment that I stand in-' the way." r.

"Father then had a baseball bat and had struck mother twice on the head, I pleaded with him not to kill mother but he paid no attention to me. I grabbed mother in my arms and begged father to stop striking her. He did so, but then lifted me from the bed. I guess mother was unconscious JUhen, for she said noth ing. I callSd to her several times, saying father was sorry and that I would get some water and bathe ber head. I really thought father would let her alone and let me attend her, and as I got to the door to go out for a pail of water and a sponge I saw him take a revolver from the bureau and shoot her many times. I don't re member anything after that until many hours later when I awoke in the bed of a friend of mother's on the first floor."

BIG STICK LOADED President Will Use Libel Law on the Yellow Journals Washington, Dec. 11—"If they can be reached for criminal libel, I shall try to have them reached," said Presi dent Roosevelt In speaking this aft ernoon about "those Americans who have been guilty of infamous false hood concerning the acquisition of the property and the construction of the Panama canal itself." It was to the committee of one hnndred of the lakes to the gulf deep waterway association headed by Governor Deneen of Ill inois, who were received by the presi dent In the east room of the white house that he made this declaration. Governor Deneen had presented a copy of the resolutions adopted by the association and made a few remarks to which the president replied as fol lows: "I have felt, as the governor has so well put it, that no more Important service could be rendered to this country than the building of the Pan ama canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific and one thing I am proud of In connection with the building of that canal is that there has not been legitimate cause for the breath of scandal connected with any feature of the proceeding. We have cause to be ashamed of only one set of Ameri cans in connection with the building of the canal, and that Is of those Americans who have been guilty of infamous falsehood concerning the ac quisition of the property and the con struction of the canal Itself. If they can be reached for criminal libel, I shall try to have them reached. If not, at any rate all the facts we know or ever have known are at the dispos al of each and every one of you here, and of anyone in congresa or of all congress if they wish to see them. "Next only in importance from the physical standpoint to building the Panama canal comes the question of developing the use of our own water ways. That must be done bv the poli cy of irrigation at the headwaters up in the arid regions, and where you come from, gentlemen, it is to be done by making our sea coast lake a big loop in from the gulf of Mexico to the great lakes and we will see that that work Is done just as honestly, just as efficiently, as the Panama canal work has been done and no work could have.been done from beginning to end more honestly or more efficiently."
