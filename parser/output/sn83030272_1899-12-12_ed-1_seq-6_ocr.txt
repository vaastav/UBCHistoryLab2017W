Tho momentous question Is how ) far this sympathy may bo conortod Into actual participation In tho wnr on tho sldo A of tho Boer republics.

Tho British express confidence that they enn prevent tho Capo Doers from following this exnmplo, but tho question hns not been tested nnd In n problematical factor In tho wnr. Tho Importance of this mutter appears when wo rememlMT tho great prepondor nnsoof tho Boers In Capo Colony. No Idea of their numerical superiority can Iwi gained from ofllclal statlt-tles, for all tho whites aro enumerated as Drltlsh subjects, without roforonco to tho languages tnc. ppc Tho approximate number of Doers mny bo Inferred from tho i-tntlstles of tho throo Dutch Church organizations, tho Dutch Reformed, tho United Reformed, nnd tho Chrlbtlnn Reformed Churches, nil of whoso members nro Doers, with tho exception of the Hollanders who nro moro recent nrrlvnls.

Wlnalotr In Wnohlngton. Tho Hon. Ervino Win-blow, Secretary of tho Now England branch of tho Antt Imperialist League, has gone to Washington again to find nnd to Impress Congress. It may bo remembered by collectors thnt this eccentric old Iwy descended upon Wnshlng ton Inst winter for tho purposoof tailoring with Congress. "Whoro Is Congress?" asked tho good man as ho hired n hordlc; nnd tho facetious driver answered : " Why, at tho Congressional Hotel, sure." To tho Congressional Hotel, then, was tho Hon. Ervino Winhlow whirled with all his con Nolutlons rolling rnpldly. Ho actually expected to tlnd most of tho members of the Congress thore, and Is suid to have been greatly comforted by the night of ono or two In tho barroom. Forthwith ho con ferred with them. Ho conferred with Sena tors. Ho went home happy, telling every body that tho peace treaty wns beaten. Ho Is now going to prevent expnnsion, but wo ndvlse him to keep nwny from mem bers of tho Flfty-llfth Congress who nro nlso In tho Fifty-sixth. They will lo suro to ask him what liecnmo of those ten million signatures to tho nntl-expnnslon petitions thnt he promised to hno beforo Dec. 25, 1 808. Wo nlso nd ho lit in to keep nwny from memliers of tho police. They will bo inclined to run him In nsn crank if they havo read his Thanksgiving message to or curse of Mr. McKinley. Mr. Winslow will not fnll to confer with his brethren of tho Washington Anti-Imperialist Lengue. Thero nro ns many ns lho of them, wo believe; nnd they spend most of their tlmo In writ ing letters to Gen. Samiio Bowles's SprinafitUl Republican. And while Mr. Winslow is In Washington he ought to com municate with a fellow Tngalog tout, Geu. Morrison I. Swirr of Los Augoles, Cut., Secretary of tho Filipino Liberation Socioty, which consists entirely of Gen. Morrison I. Swift. Mr. Winslow must know Oen. Swift, who was eminent In Boston a few years ngo nnd blew tho trump trumpet horrendous!. It wns Gen. Sw ift who started to lend n force of the foes of work from Boston to Washington, where they were to Join Geu. Jake Coxey'k gazaboo grenadiers. Gen. Coxey Is making money and rides In palace cars instead of on shanks' mnro and Gen. Swift is still unreconciled and looking for trouble. Ho should bo summoned to Washington to moot Mr. Winslow. Tho Massachusetts antl-lmperlallsts ought to bo glad of tho chanco to bring tho two thinkers together. Gen. Swift Is moro radical and moro for clblo than tho Massachusetts men. Whllo they arc squalling, ho has actually Issued a proclamation, "emancipating" tho Fili pinos. From such a leader Mr. Winslow could learn much. Tho Hon. Winslow Warren of Massachu setts and sonio other Tagal fanciers want a new party. Wo do ourselves a pleasure In nominating as tholr candidate for President, Gen. Morrison I. Swift of California; for Vice-President, tho Hon. Ervino Winhlow of Massachusetts. Platform: Down with McKinley tho usurper! Up with Aoui naldo, tho heroic defender of liberty! Old and New Temperance Reform. The moctlng of the Antl-Snloon Lengue on Sunday was only remarkable because of the presence of a travelling Countess from Denmark as tho principal speaker. Tho temperance agitation has bocn up continu ously and actively in thlncountry for hnlf a century past, and tho aim of this particular association, of compnrntlvoly recent organi zation, to consolidate tho moral and religi ous opposition to tho liquor traftle, is not novel; nor is It feasible. Practically all tho Churches, Cathollo and Trotcstant, havo modo formal declarations against that traffic, but they aro no moro likely to consolidate against It than they nro to unlto organically. Tho Council of the Roman Cnthollcs nt Baltimore exhorted nil Catholics to get out of the business, nnd tho Baptists, Methodlstsnnd Presbyterians, Including tho groat majority of Protestnnts, havo denounced It, but tho gulf lietwcen Protestantism nnd Cnthollclsm Is not bridged. Tho Row Dr. SlllELimof Princeton University, for Instance, left Presbyterian Ism becauso ho had lieon summoned licforo his presbytery for disobeying n precept of thoGenornl Assembly forbidding n Presby terian minister to nsslst in procuring n license for n liquor snloon, ns ho hnd done in tho Instance of tho taproom of tho Prince ton Inn. Probably If nny minister of any Church had dono llkowlso ho would hnvo subjected himself to censure, whether It has such n formnl precept or not, both by hlB ecclesiastical superiors and by tho outsldo public. Tho people who pat ronize tho drinking saloons do not expect thoblosslngof tho Church on tho establish ments. Thoy know them better than tho parsons do. Tho liquor trnflle, tfio snloon, mny thcreforo bo said to be under n re ligious linn. At most, it Is only tolerated ns n perhaps Irrepressible evil. Those en gagod in dispensing liquor in saloons nro set upart, from other business; by tho admonition of tho Roman Catholic Conn ell, for Instnnce, thoy miffer from n specific discrimination, tho main ground of which, probably, Is thnt thoy tempt the poor to extravagant e.xiendlture; nnd thnt economical ovll Is rcnlly ono of tho worst In the trnflle. All these religious efforts, however, would U unavailing of themselves to prevent people from keeping snloons nnd patronis ing them, In this and othor Stntes now lnws regulating tho traffic and Increasing tho cost of licenses for It havo diminished the number of drinking places, nnd their en nctment, undoubtedly, hns boon promoted by tho temperance ugitatlon. Tho main cause of tho decrease In Intemperance, however, has been tho sprend of knowl edge, lnrgely obtained by experience, that It IsngnliiBtoJinmon senso nnd too costly In Its injurious effects. Sinco undue nko hollo stimulation affects llrst tho Judg ment, woakenlng It seriously, It Is known to bo responsible for a great part of tho business failures. The really notablo financiers of Wall Street do not belong to .tho " cocktail brigade," cleuincea of head I nnd soundness of Judgment being too Indlspcnsnblo to them. Only tho smnll fry depend on "whiskey cournge." In tho soclnl Intercourse of prlvnto life, too, tho consumption of liquor hns decrenscd grently. Dinners uiu no longer drinking liouts and tho time spent on them hns leen diminished greatly. Drunkenness hns beeoino disreputable, or Is pitied as tho mnnlfestntlon of n deplorable dlscnso. In nil cnlllngs In life, from tho highest to tho lowest, sobriety Is moro nnd moro nt a premium nnd intompernnco Is moro nnd moro distrusted Tho temperance ngltntlon which hns been most cffcctunl, therefore, hns been scien tific rather thnnpti rely motnl nnd religious. Forthoold-fnshloiied "touiporntieopledgo" ofthodnysof Got'oii, tho specific medical treatment of dlpsomnnln ns n dlscnso hns been substituted, nnd men nro tempcrnto from Intelligent regard fortho preservation of their sanity. Moreover, tho Increas ing fierceness of modern competition Is warning men of tho necessity of keep ing their wits nbout thorn If thoy nro to make hend ngulnst it. Along with tho strong tendency to tho consolidation of business nt this tlmo comes n demand for special ami eminent Individual ability to satisfy Its requirements greater than over beforo in history. Never In tho past wns flrst-cluss ndmlnlstrntlvo ability so suro of rich nnd distinguished rownrd ns It is now. Great captains of affairs nro needed. Every wenk point In n innu Is discovered under tho stress of such n trlnl. Wnll Street Is lilted with tho btock nnd bonds of vast consolidated Industrial enterprises which can only be maintained prosperously by the continuance in their management of a succeislon of peculiar ndmlnlstrntlvo talents. The percentage of commissions nnd the margin of prollt have been steadily reduced, until they nro nt n limit so low that only tlio grentest olumo of transac tions, nud consequently the grentestnblllty of management, enn make business profita ble or keep It from sinking. At this tlmo, therefore, men hnvo found out thnt they cannot drink to excess If they nro to hold their own. Science nud Invention have opened up nnd aro steadily rxlt'iidlug fields of labor wherein tho keen est Intelligence In tho mechanic lb requisite, so thnt he cannot afford to fuddle his hend with drink ; he must bo a mnu who can nl w ays bo depended on or he will bo drlen out. Never lioforo was suspicion of Intemperance In it worker so fatal to his success ns now. Every mnn who Is wise keeps himself con btiiutly In lighting trim for tho contest. All Miclety, theiefore, bus become a tern Ieraiici "lengue." nnd hurrowing pictures of drunkenness deemed effective In tho old time mo nut now necewwiry to wnru men of n dunger of whose reality thoy are kept con (clous by their dully experience. Drunk enness has gone out of vogue both us n fushlounblo and us a popular amusement. It In n habit In which only those whose health nud life uro valueless to themselves nnd toevcrybodyelso enn nfford to Indulge. A Leader In Congress 5 In his speech In the House of Representa tives, yesterduy, on the Currency bill. Mr. OVEliSTREi-Tof Indiana, the lntroducerof tho bill, snld thnt the Secretnry of tho Treasury, "bynslnglo order directing tlio use of sil ver In tlio illschnrgo of our obligations, mny completely dostroy tho parity, and shift the standard to tho mrlttl so used." This Is sheer nonsense. Tho Secretary of the Treasury has no moro power to uso the mehif, silver, In tho discharge of our obligations than he hns to use tho metnl, gold. Ho can uso only gold coin or nil ver coin. Gold coin is, indeed, worth ns currency no moro thnn the gold it contains, liecause any ow ner of gold can, nt plensure, hnvo It converted Into coin In unlimited quantities free of chnrge, but tho enso Is qulto different with sliver. Sliver dollars pass cut rent ns equal to gold dollnrs to tho mimlcrof 450,000,000, nlthough tho metnl of which they nro composed Is equal In vnluo to only nbout 40 cuts In gold, for tho renson that tho coinage of them Is a Government monopoly, and Is not ohii to tho public. Nothing but unlimited free sllvcrcolnago can reduce tho value of tho silver dollnrs to their vnluo ns metnl, nnd Mr. Over-street betrays on tlio subject nn Ignorance of fnct nnd of lnw, which In n lender In Congress Is ludicrous, not to say disgraceful.

Thoy hnvo delllierntely blackened Its reputation, degraded nnd vltlnted It, notwlthstnndlng their prollts fiom it depend upon their success in obtnlnlng popular support of tlmlr show. The Amorlcnn people are notnbly sound In their views of sport, keen lovers of It, nnd orderly. Rut tho National Leaguo hns made the national gnmo lough, nud even riotous, taking nwny fiom It tho first essential of fnlr piny nnd order In nil com petition, the nuthorlty of the umpire. Tho prize ilng, with Its rigidly nnd honorably maintained supremacy 0f t, referee, is iM'tter entitled to respect than tho contests ot the League where rowdyism brenks out nt will, mid delles tho umpire.

SITUATIOS IS KOVTII AFIilCA. Tlio later reports ot tho dlsastor to Gen. Gataoro's force In its attempted surprise of tho lloor portion at Htormberg In tho early nours of Sunday morning mako It oven more com plete thnn first apponred. It was only saved from becoming a total rout by tho admlrablo work of the field guns that covered tho hur ried retreat of the shattcrod brigade, wearied by a whole night's marching and thedlscouragomnnt ot defeat. By his re tirement to Moltono, eleven miles to the south of Stormberg Junction, Gen. Gatncro Is In the snme position he wns n week ngn, but with the pollticnl situntlon erlously compromised owing to his defeat. Whether the wavering Dutch will be eneourngod by It to follow tho examoloof those already with the republican Invading levies remains to be seen, but there seems n very general apprehension thnt they will; In which caso the interest of tho cam paign will shift from tho front to the bise. flen French with his mounted column nnd light artillery is reported to h.ivo selred Arundol. nbout twelve miles north ot Naauw I'oort, on tho railway to Colesberg, and thirty two to Norvals l'ont on tho Orange River. It Is probable that his further advance will de pend upon how soon Gen Unlacre can get his column Into shape ngalu and resume his for ward movement. According to the descrip tions of tho tlghtlug. the lloers holding tho Stormberg position nro numerous and well bupplled with guns ot different kinds, but hnrdly seem to have appreciated tho fulncst of their opportunity on this occasion. Tho Klmberloy relief column Is still at tho Moddor Itlvet feeling Its front nndrisht, but has not yet succeeded In getting the lloers to disclose their strength or position except at ono point, Magersfontolii, nt the east end of the Snytfontcln rnngo of hills. The Hoor nrtll lory In position at Magersfontcln Is reported to boot Inferior range to the British, but It Is bellevod they 1 1 five, more powerful guns, the position of which thuy appear un willing to unmask by replying to tho British tet llrlnit. Their movements generally seem to create much uncertainty at the head quarters on tho Modder Ttlvor, they bolng re ported one day In strong fnrco at some point, and the next as havlnir disappeared These are essentially Doer tactics, and will constitute tho difficulty and dangor to tho British forces at thoy move higher up country nnd lengthen out their attenuated lino of communications.
