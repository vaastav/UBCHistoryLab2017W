Washington, ..VecernberJ To (he Senate and House of Jicpreseni In cinio before jou for the first t-Je s Chiff Magistrate of this great nation, it is with great gratitude to the Giver of all good for .the many benefit we enjoy. We are blessed with poaea at home, and are ( with out entangling alliances abroad, to forebode trouble; with a ter ritory unsurpassed in fertility, ot an area equal to the abundant sup port of five hundred millions of peo ple, and abounding in every variety of useful minerals in quantity bu& cient to supply the world for genera- ffc oTnhcrant crops , wu 14 . v - . : riety o 7 oi. -climate auapicu i tion of every species w m - .v-w, and suited to th. habit,; taetes and requirement of every living thing; with a population cf forty; milhana of free people, all speaking one lan guage; with facilities for every mortal to acquire an education; with insti tutions closing to none the avenues of fame, or any blessing cf fortune that may be coveted; with freedom of the pulpit, the press and the school ; with ins? into the National Treasury beyond the requirements of the Government. Peace and har mony ii being rapidly restored withm our own borders.

These blessings and nrmntiomi others are eatrusted to .w v rfmii. naro . and mine tor . eata tnor.in-r , for the brief period of our tenure of office. . In a Bhort irn Tnnqf. paah of us return to I n-anL-a of tha DeODlc.

C3 it was, by the sympathy and assistance of nations .;th hih wa were at peace. Eleven States of the Union were, four left without legal tate iinrornnmnt! a debt had been con tracted; American commerce, had been driven liom the seas; the indus try of one-half the country had been tha control ot the capi talist nnd nlace J where 'all ' labor rightfully belong io the keeping c the laborer. The work ot restoring Stntc Jovprninantsloval to the Union ot protecting and fostering free labor and providing means for paying the Interest on the Dubuo debt, cas re ceived aruo'd attention from Congress Although your members have not met with the success in all particulars that mlirht hatfa been desired, yet. on the whole, they have been more suscessfu than could" have been reasonably an ticipated. Seven States which passed ordinances of sccce3ion have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, (Georgia,) held an election, at which she ratified her Constitution, republican in form, elected a Governor, members of Cocgress, a State Legislature and all the other offioers required to gov ern, was duly installed, and the Legis lature met and performed all the acts then required of them by the recon struction acts of Congress. Subse quently, however, in violation of the Constitution which they bad just rati fied, as sinco decided by tho Supreme Court of the State", they unseated the colored members of tho Legislature and admitted to seats some members who era disqualified by the third clauso of tho Fourteenth Amend ment to the Constitution an article which thev themselves had contrib uted to ratify. Under these circum stances, I would submit to you whether it would not be wise without delay to pa3 a law authorizing tho Governor of Georgia to convene tho members originally elected to the Lcgi?laturc requiring each mem ber to take the oath pre sented by tho Reconstruction Act, and none to be admitted who are inelinible under the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedmen, under tho protection they have received, are making rapid progress in learning, "and no com plaints, arc heard of a lack of indus try on their part when they receive fair remunsration for their labor. The means provided for paying the in terest on the public debt, with all oth er expenses of Government, are more than ample. The loss of our comuirecsj is the only result of the late re bellion, which has cot received sufficient attention from you. To this subject 1 call your earnest at tention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may bo effected, but will, if necessary, make it-the subject of a ppecial message during the session of Congress. At the March term, Congress, by a joint resolution, author ized the Executive to order an election in the States cf Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, to submit to them the constitutions which each had in convention previously framed, and submit tho constitution, either entire, or in separate parts, to be voted on at the discretion of the Ex ecutive. Under this authority, elec tions were called. In Virginia, the election took place ontheCth of July, IStJ'J. The G ovcrnor and Lieut. Gover nor elected have been installed. The Legislature met, and did all required by this resolution and by .11 the re construction acts, and abstained from all doubtful authority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives and the State be fully restored to its places ia the family of States. An elec tion was called in Mississippi and Texas, to copoaencc on the 30th of No vember, 18(30, ami to last two days ia Mississippi -and four days in Texas. The elections have taken place, but tho result is not known. It is to be hoped that the acts of the Legisla tures cf thesa States, when they meet, will be such as. to receive your appro bation, and thus close the work of reconstruction. Among the evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to. is that of aa irredeemable currency. It is an evil, which I hope will receive vour most earnest attention, it 13 a duty, and one cf the highest dities of Government, to secure to tho citi zens a medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying value. This implies a return to specie. No substitute for it can be devised. It should be com menced now, and reached at tho ear liest practical moment consistent with a fair regard to the interest cf the debtor clas. Immediate resumption, if practicable!, would cot be desirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay beyond their contracts the premium on gold at the date cf their purchase, and would brir bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuations, how- ever. i a 1113 paixr vaiue oi wai? urc cf all values, gold, detrimental to fhe interests cf trade., it Eases ( the man of business an involuntary gambler, for in all sales vrnen ruture payment is to bo made, both parties speculate aa to what will be the value of the currency , to be . paid and re ceived. I earnestly recommend to you, then, such legislation a3 will insure a gradual retirn to specie payments and put an immediate stop to fluctuation in the value of currenay. Tho method3 to secure these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy. To secure the latter there is but one way, and that is to authorize the Treasury to re deem its own paper at a nxed price whenever Dresected; to withhold from circulation all such currency redeemed until sold again lor gold. The vast resources oi tne nation, coin de veloped and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the best on earth. With less burden of taxation than the citizens have endured for six years past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten years; but it is cot deemed advisable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time, lear cy year tne ability to pay increases in a rapid ratio, but the burden or interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without the violation of' contract." The public debt is represented, in great part, by bonds, having from nve to twenty, ana irom ten to forty years, to run, bearing interest at the rate oi six per cent, and five per cent., respectively. It i optional- with the uovernment to pay their bonds at any period alter the expira tion of the last time mentioned upon their face. The time has already ex pired when a great part of them may be taken up. The time is rapidly ap proaching whn all may be. It is believed thatf all which are now due,' may be replaced by bonds bearinz a rate of . interest not exceeding lour ana one-nan psr cent., and as rapidly as the remainder becomes due that tbey may be re placed in the same way. Ta accom plish thi3, it may be necessary to au thorize 'the 'interest to be paiJ'at either of the three or four money cen tres of Europe, or by an Assistant Treasurer of the United "States at the option of tha v holders cf the bonds. I Buecjst ' this sub ject for tho consideration ot ton gress. Also, simultaneously wun mis, . . . .. .!.!? the propriety ot - redeeming our currency., as before-susrzested, at its market value at the time the law goes into effect, and increasing the rate at which the currency will be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at the Eame rato of interest as the Government pay3 upon its bonds. The subject of tariff and internal taxation will necessarily receive jour attention. The revenues of the coun try are creater than the requirements. and may, with safety, bo reduced, but as tho iundioc; cf tho debt in a lour or a four and one-half per cent, bond would reduce the annual current ex pense largely, thus, after funding, justifying a greater reduction of taxa tion than would be now expedient, I would suggest a postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress, a a it may be advisable to modify the taxation and tariff in instances where unjust or burden some discriminations are made by the present laws. But a general re vision ot the laws regulating this subject I recommend the postpone ment of for the present. I also sug gest the renewal of tho tax on in comes, but at a reduced rate, say of three per cent., and this tax to expire in three years. With the funding of the national debt as here suggested, I fjel Eafe in taying the taxes and. rev enue from imports may be re duced Faf-3ly from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and still further' reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed. The report of the Secretary cf the Treasury shows the receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 18G9, to bo f : 370,9 13,7-17, and the ex penditures, including interest, boun tiej, &c, to be $321,490,597.- The estimates for tho ensuing year arc more favorable to the Government, and will, no doubt, ehow a iarga de crease of tha public debt. The re ceipts in the Treasury beyond the expenditures have exceeded the amount neaesfary to place to the credit of the Sinking Fund, as pro vided by law. To lock up the surplus in the Treasury, and withhold it from circulation, would lead to such a con traction of currency a? to cripple trade and seriously affect the pros perity ot the country. Under these circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily con curred in the propriety of using all the surplus currency ; in the Treasury in the purchase of Government bonds, thus reducing tho interest-bearing debt of the country, and of submitting to Congress the question of tho disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the Treasury amount to about $75,000,000, includ ing those belonging to the sinking fund. I recommend that tho whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund. Your attention is respectfully invited to: the rec ommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office ot Commissioner of Customs, and revenues for the increase of sal ary to certain classes of officials, and tho substitution of increased National Bank circulation to icplace the out standing three per cent, certificate?, and. most especially to his recom mendation for the repeal of laws allowing eht.res of fines, penalties, for- feiturts &o , to omccrs oi the Gov ernment or to informers. The office of Commissioner cf Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous and re sponsible under the Government. It falls but little, if any. short of a Cabinet posi tion in its importance and responsibilities. I would ask for it, therefore, sueh legislation aa in vour judgment will place the office on a tooting ot d .gnity commensurate with it3 importance, and with a character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it properly. As tho United States is the freest of all na tions, so, too, its people sympathize with all peoples struggling for liberty and Belf-goveromcat.- But whila eo sympathising, it is due to our honor that we should abstain from cnfoicing cur views upon un willing nations, and from taking an interested part, without invitation, in iuu nuarrtis oetweeu Giuerent na tions, or between Governments and their subjects. Our course should always be in conformity with strict iustico and law, international and local. Such has been the policy of the Administration iu, dealing with these questions. For more than a year a valuable province of Spain, and a near neighbor of curs, in whom all cur people cannot but feel a deep interest, hal been strur'slins for tho independeaca and freedom of the reople, atrt the Government of tho United States entertain the same warm feelings and ym rathies for the people cf Cuba - -o , - 7--, . tbey . mamxes.ea .nroug vious struggle between Spain and the former colonies in bchali oi the lat ter, but'the contest at no time'as sumed the conditions which amount to a war, in the sense of international law, or which would show the exist ence of a de facto political organiza tion of the insurgents sufficient to justify a recognition of belligerency." The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge, when, to accord the right3 of bellig erency either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government which they believe to be oppressive, or to independent nations at war with each other. The United States have no disposition to interfere with the existing relation of Spain to her co lonial possessions in this country. They believe that in ' due time Spain and other European powers will find it their interest in terminating these relations and establishing their present dependencies as independent powers. Members of the family of nations, the dependencies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one European Power to another. When the present relations of the colonies cease, they are to become independent powers, exercising the right of choice and of self-control in the determination oi mctr juiuto con dition and relation with other powers. The United States, in order to put. a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in the interest ot a neignooring peopie, proposed their good offices to bring the existing contest to a termination. the offer not being accepted by cpain on a basis which we believed could be received -by Cuba was withdrawn. It is hoped that the good offices of the. United States may yet prove ad vantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Meanwhile, a num ber of illegal expeditions sgainst Cuba have been broken up. It has been the endeavor of the Administration to execute the Neutrality Laws in good faith, no matter how .unpleasant the task, made eo by the suffering we have endured from lack oi like good Fdith Inwards ua Lv other cations. . The United States schooner Lizzie Major was arrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate and two passengers taken from it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representations cf these facts were made to the Spanish Govern reant as soon as official information of them reached Washington. The two passeDgcr3 were set at liberty, and the Spanish Government assured the United States that the captain of the frigate, in making the capture, had acted without law; that he had been reprimanded for the irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish authorities in Cuba would not sanc tion dt act that could violate the rights or treat with disrespect the sov ereignty ol this nation. The question of tho seizure of the brig Mary Lowell, at one of the Ba hama Islands, by the Spanish author ities, is now the sumacs ot corres pondence between this Government and those of Spain and Great Britain. The Cantain-General of Cuba, about May last, issued a proclamation au thorizing search to be made of vessels on tho'hish seas. Immediate remon strance was made against thi, where upon the Captain-General issued a new proclamation, limiting tho rio-ht of search cf vessels ot the United States so far as authorized un der the treaty of 1795. This procla mation, however, was immediately withdrawn: I have always felt that the most intimate relations should be cultivated between the Republic of tha United States and all indspca- dent nations on this continent. It may be well worth considering whether the new treaties oeiweeu iuu uuueu States end them may bo Dot profit ably entered into to secure more intimate relatiocs, friendly. commercial and otherwue. The subiect of an inter-oceanio canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, through the Isth mus of Darien, ia one which commerce is greatly interested ia. Instructions have been given to our Minister to the Republic of the United States of Columbia to endeavor to cb-.iin "authority for a survey by this Government, in order to determine the practicability cf such an undertaking and a char ter for tho right of way to build by private enterprise such woik If the survey proves it to bo practi cable, ia order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed commission at Lima for the adjustment cf claims, it became necessary to send a Commissioner to Lima, in August la3t. No ap propriation having been made by Congress for this purpose, it is now asked that one be made covering the past and future expenses of the Com mission. . The good office of the United States to bring about a peace between Spain and the South Ameri can Republics, with which she is at war, havin? been accepted by Spain. Peru and Chili, a Congress has been invited to be held in Washington during the present Winter. A grant ha3 been given to the Euro peans of an exclusive right of transit over Nicaragua territory, to which Cost3 Rica ha3 given its assent, which, it ia alleged, conflicts with the vested rights of the citizens cf the United States. The Depaatment of State has now this subject under consideration. The Minister of Peru having made representations that there was a State of war between Tcru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing, ia cr near New York, thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as to relieve the force at Cuba, so as to operate against Peru, orders were given to prevent their de parture. -No further step? having been taken by the representatives of the Peruvian Government to prevent the departure of these vessels, and I, not feeling authorized to detain the prop erty of a nation with which we are at peace, on a mere executive order, tha matter ha3 been referred to the courts to decide. The conduct of. tho - war be tween the Allies and the Republic of Paraguay ha3 made the intercourse with that country so difiicult that it has been deemed advisable to with draw our representative from there. Towards the close cf the last Administration, a conven tion was signed at London for the settlement of all m outstandicg claims between Great Britain and the United States, which failed to receive the advico and consent of tho Senate to its ratification. The time and the circumstances attandicg the negotia tion of the treaty were favorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States, and its provisions were wholly inadequate for tho settlement of the gravo wrongs thai had been sustained by this Government as) well a3 by its citizens. The injuries resulting to the United States by reason of the course adopted by Great Britain during our late civil war by increased rates ot insurance and the diminution cf exports and im ports, and other obstructions to do mestic industry and prod action, in it3 effect upoa the foreign commerce of the country, ia the decrease and tracsfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine, in the prolongation the increased and in the porters could satisfied aa of the war and '. cost both in treasury lives oi its sup not be adjusted, and ordinary commercial continually arise be claims, which tween commercial nations. Yet the Convention elected them simply as such ordinary claims from which they differ more widely in the gravity of their character than in the magnitude of their amount. Great even as is that difference, not a word was found in the treaty, and not an inference could be drawn from it, to remove the sense of the unfriendliness of the course of Great Britain in our strug gle for existence, which had so deep ly and universally impressed itself on the people of this country. Believing that a Convention, thus misconceived in its scope, and made quite in its provisions, wouid not have produced the hearty, cordial settlement of pending ques- lions, wnicn aione is consistent witn the relations which I desire to have estaoiisned Detween tne umteactates and. Great Britain, I regard the action of the Senate in the rejection of the treaty, to have been wisely taken, in the interest of peace and as a necessary Et;p in the direction of a perfect and cordial friendship between the two countries. Sensitive peop'e, conscious of. their power, ara more at ease under a great wrong wholly nnatoned,. than under the restorial of a settlement, which satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense ot the griev ance they have sustained. The rejec tion of the treaty was followed by a state of public feeling, on both sides, which. I thought not favorable to an immediate attempt at re newed, negotiations. I, accord ingly, so instructed tbe Minister of the United States to Great Britain, and found that my view3 in this re gard wero shared by-Her. Mtjesty'a ministry. 'I'. hope the time may soon arrive when the two Governments can approach the Eolation of this mo mentous question with an assurance of what is due to the rights, dignity and honor of each, and with the de termination not only to remove the causes of complaint in the past, but to lay the foundation of a broad principal of public law, which will prevent future differences and Eecure their firm and continued peace and friendship. This is now the only grave question-which the United States has with any foreign nation. - ' The question oi treaty - for reciprocity between the United States and the British provinces on this continent has not been favorably con sidered by tao administration. The advantage of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the British pro ducer except,- possibly, a few engaged in the trade between the two sections. No citizen of the United States would be benefitted by recipro city. Our Internal- Revenue tax ation would prove a protection to the British producer, almost equal to the protection which our manufacturer now receives from the tariff. Some arrangement, however, for the regu lation of commercial intercourse be tween the United States and the Dominion of Canada may be desira ble. The commission for adjusting the claims of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Compa ny upon the United States has ter minated -its labor. The award of $650,000 hes been made, and all the rights and titles of the Company on the territory of the United States have been extinguished, and deeds for the property oi the Company have been received. An eppropriation by Congress to meet this sum is asked. The Commissioners for determin ing the northern land boundary between the United States and the British possessions, under the treaty of 1836, have completed their labors, and the Commission has been dis solved. In conformity with the recom mendation of Congress, a propo sition was early made to the British Government to abolish the mixed rrmrts created under the treaty of April 7, 1S62, for the suppression of the slave trade. J.ne suoject is emu under negotiation. It having come to my knowl edgj that a corporate company, organizsd under British laws, pro posed to land upon the shores of the United States, and to op erate here, a submarine cable, un der a concession from His Majesty, the Emperor of the French, of an exclusive right, for twenty years, of telegraphic commu nication between the shores of France and the United States, with the very objectionable feature of sub jecting all messages conveyed thereby to the sovereignity and the control of the French Government. I caused the Biitish and French legations at Washington to be made acquainted with the probable policy of Congress on the Bubjecr, as foreshadowed by the bill which passed the Senate in March last. This drew from the re presentatives of the Company an agreement to accept, as a basis of their operations, the provisions of the bill or of such other enactment of the subject as might be passed during the approaching session of Congress; also to use their influence to secure from the French Government a ratification of their concessions, eo as to permit the landing upon i"rench Boil of any cable belonging to any company incor porated by the authority of the United States, or of any State in tho Union, and on their part cot to oppose the establishment of any such cable. In consideration of this agreement I directed the with drawal of all opposition by the United States authorities to the landing of the cable, and to the working of it, until the meeting of Congress. I re gret to say that there has been no modification in the companies' con cession, nor, so far as I can learn, have they attempted to secure one. .Their cooceqsioa excludes the capital and - the citizens of the United States from competition upon the ehores of France. 1 recom mend legislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States as well as the dignity and sovereignty of the cation against such an assump tion. 1 shall also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an abandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean telegraphing cables. Copies of this correspondence is herewith furnished. The unsettled political condition of other countries les3 fortunate than our own sometimes induces their citi zens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of becoming natural ized. Having secured this, they re turn to their native country without disclosing their change of allegiance. They occupy official positions or posi tions of trust or honor, which can only be held by citizens of their native land. .They journey under passports describing them as such citi zens; and it is only when civil discord, aftet, perhaps, years of quiet threatens them or threatens their per sons or their property.or when theirna tive States draft them into its military service, that the fact of their change of allegiance is made known ; they re side permanently out of the United States; theycontribute nothing to its revenues; they avoid the duties of it3 citizenship, and .hey only make themselves known by a claim of pro- tection. jl nave directed diplomatic and Consular officers of the United State to scrutinize carefully all such claims of protection. The citizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who discharges his dntv ta his country, is entitled to its complete protection.; While I have a voice in the direction of affairs, I shall not consent to impair the sacred right by conferring it upon fic titious and fraudulent claimants. On the accession of the present Administration it was found that the Minister of North Germany had made propositions for negotiations for a convention for the protection of emigrant passengers to which no re sponse had been given. It was conclud ed that to be effectual all the maritime powers engaged in the trades should join in such a measure. Invitations have been extended to the Cabinets of London, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels, the Hague, Copenhagen and Stockholm, to em.ower their repre sentatives at Washington to simulta neously enter into negotiations, and to conclude with the United States conventions identical in form, making uniform regulations as to the con struction ot the parts of vessels to be devoted to the use of emigrant, pas sengers, as to the quality and quantity of food, as to medical treatment of the sick, and a to the rules to be ob served during the voyage, in order to secure veniiation, to promote health, to prevent the intrusion of females and providing for the establishment of tribunals in the several countries for enforcing such regulations by summa ry process...'. .. .. . .,, ,1 l xour attention isrespecuuiiy canea to the law regulating the tariff on Russian hemp, and to the question whether to fix the charges on Russian hemp higher than' they are fixed on maniila, is not a vitiation of our treaty with Russia, placing her products upoa the same footing with those cf the most favored na tions. Our manufactures are increas ing with wonderful rapidity under the encouraeement which they now re ceive With the . improvements , in machinery already effected, and still increasing, causing machinery to take the place of skilled labor to a large extent, our imports of many articles must fall off largely within a very few years. Fortunately too many manu factures are not eonnned to a few localities as formerly, anc. it is to be hoped they will -become more dif fused, making the interest in them eaual in all sections. They cive em ployment and support to hundreds of thousands ot people at borne, and re tain with uj the means which other wise would be shipped abroad. The construction of railroads in Europe and the East is bringing into compe tition with our agricultural products like products of other countries. Self- interest, if not self-preservation, there fore.dictates caution against disturbing anv industrial interest ot the country. It teaches us also the necessity of looking to other markets for the sale of our surplus. Our neighbors south cfus, and China and Japan, Bhould receive our special attention. It will be the endeavor of the Administra tion to cultivate such relations with all these nations as to entitle us to their confidence, and make it their in terest as well ours to establish better commercial relations. L Through the agency oi a more enli&htencd policy than that here tofore pursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and efforts of one of our own distin cuished citizens, the world is about to commence largely increased rela tions with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As tho tUnitcd States havo been the initiatory in the new policy, so they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a success. In this connection I advise such legislation as will forever preclude the enslavement of the Chinese upon our soil under tho name of Coolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in tho transportation ot Coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also recommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first-class. On my assuming the responsibilities of Chief Magistrate ot the United States, it was with the convictioa that three thing) were essential to peace, prosperity and the fullest de velopment. First among these, is strict integrity in fulfilling all our ob ligations. " Second, To secure protec tion to the person and property of the citizens of our common country where ever he may choose to move, without reference to his original nationality, religion, color or politics demanding of him only obedience to the laws and proper respect for the rights of others. Third. The union of all the States with equal rights, indestract able by any unconstitutional means. To secure the first of these. Congress has taken two essential steps. First. In declaring by joint resolution that the public debt should be paid, prin cipal and interest, in coin. Second. By providing means for paying. Providing the means, however, could cot secure . the object de sired, without the proper adminis tration of the laws for the collection of the revenues, and the economical disbursements of them.. To this sub ject the Administration has most earnestly addressed itself, with re sults, I believe, satisfactory to the country. There has been no hesita tion in changing officials ie order to seenre efficient execution of the laws; sometimes, too, where, in a mere party view,nndesirable political results were likely to follow, for any hesitation in sustaining efficient officials against re monstrances wholly political. It may be well to mention here the embarrassment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so called Tenure-cf-Office act, and to earnestly recommend their total re peal. It could not have been the in tention of the framers of the Consti tution, when providing that appoint ments made by the President should reeeive tli8 consent of tha Senate; that the latter should have the power to retain in office person placed there by Federal appointments against the will of the President. The law is inconsistent with a faithful and effi cient administration of the Govern ment. What faith can the Executive put in officials forced upon him, ua these, too, whom ho has suspended for reasons? How will such officials be likely to serve an administration which they know does not trust them? For the eecond requisite to enr growth and prosperity, time and a firm but humane administration of the existiog laws, amended from time to time, as they may prove ineffective, or provo harsh and unneces sary, aro probably all that are required. The third cannot be attained by special legislation, but mu?t be rejarded a3 fixed by the j Constitution itself, and gradually ao- quiesced in by force of public opinion, j From the foundation of the Gov : crcment to the present, the manaze- ment of "the original inhabitants of this continent the Indians has been a subject of embarrassment and expense, and has been attended with contensions, robberies, murders and wars. From my own experienco upon tho frontier and in the Indian countries, I do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the. whites who come most in con tact with the Indians, blameless for those hostilities. The past, however, cnanot be undone, and the question must be met as we now find it. I have attempted a new policy towards these wards of the nation they can not be regarded in any other light than as wards with fair results eo far as tried, and which, I hope, will be attended ultimately with great success. Ihe bociety ot r riends is well known as having succeeded in living in peace with Indians, in the early settlement ot Pennsylvania, while their white neighbors of other sections, were con stantly embroiled. They . are also known for their opposition to all strife, resistance and war. and are generally noted for their strict integ rity and iatr dealings. These consid erations induced me to give the man agement oi a lew reservations ot Indi ans to them, and to throw the burthen oi selecting agents upon the society itself. The result has proven- most satisfactory. It will be found more fully set forth in the report of the Commissioner cf Indian Affairs. For Superintendents and Indian Agents, not on reservations, officers of the army were selected. The reasons for this are numerous. When the Indian Agents are sent there, or ner there, troops must bo sent, also. The agent and the commander of the troops .are independent of each other, and are subject to orders from different de partments . of tho Government. The army officer holds a posi tion for life the agent one at the will of the President. The former one is personally interested in living in harmony with the Indians, and in the establishment of a , permanent peace to the end that some portion of his life may be spent within the limits of a civilized section. : The latter has no such personal interest. Another rea son is an economic one, and is still an other hold which the Government has upon a life officer to secure a . faithful discharge of duties in carrying out a given policy. The building of rail roads and the access thereby given to all agricultural and mineral regions of this "country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact with all tribes of Indians, No matter what ought to be the" relations be tween Bach settlements and the abo riginees, the fact is, they do not har monize well, and One or the other has to give way in the end, A system which looks to the extermi nation of the race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing on-itself the wrath of all " Christen dom, and engendering in the citizens a disregard for human life and the rights of others, which , is dangerous to society. I see no substitute for such a eystem except in placing all the Indians ' on large reservations as , rapidly as can be done, and giving them absolute pro tection there. As soon as they aro fitted for it, they should be induced to take their lands in severally, and to. set up a Territorial Government for their own protection. For fall details on this subject, I call your special attention to the reports of the Secretary of the Interior and Com missioner of Indian Affairs. The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department for the year ending 30th of June. 18C9, to be $30,644,042, of which $23,832,310 was disbursed in the payment of debts contracted dur ing the war, and is not chargeable to the current army expenses. . The estimate of $34,512,031 for tho ex penses of the army for the next fiscal year, is as low as it is believed it can be. The estimates of the Bureau officers have been carefully scrutin ized and reduced wherever it has been deemed practicable. If, however, the condition of the country should be such by tho beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a greater concentration of troops, the appro priation asked for will not be needed. The appropriation estimated for river and harbor improvements and fortifi cations, are submitted eeperately, and whatever amount Congress may deem proper to appropriate for these pur poses will be expended. The re commendation of- the General of the army, that appropriations be made for the forts at Boston. Port land, New York. Philadelphia, New Orleans and San Francisco, if for no other, is concurred in. I also ask your special attention to the recom mendation of the General command ing the Military Division of the Pa cific, for the sale of the seal islands of St. Paul and St, George, Alaska Ter ritory, and suggest that it either be complied with or that legislation bo made for the protection of the seal fisheries from which a rev enue should be derived. The report of the Secretary of War contains a synopsis of the reports of the heads of bureaus, of the com manders of military divisions and of the districts of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, and the report of the General of the army in full. The recommendations therein contained have been well considered and are submitted for your aotion. I, howev er, call special attention to the recommendation of the Chief-of-Ordinance for the sale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to the Government; also, to the recommend ation of the Secretary of War, that the act of the 3d of March, 18G9, prohibiting promotions and appoint ments in the staff corps of the army, be repealed. The extent of country to be garrisoned and the number of military posts to be occupied is the same. . With a reduced army, as with a large one, the cumber of Btaff officers required is more dependent upon the latter than the former condition. The report of the Secretary of tbe Navy, accompanying this, shows the condition of the Navy when this ed ministration came into office, and tho changes made since, strenuous efforts have a been made to place as many vessels in commission, or render them fit for service if re quired, as soon as possible, and to substitute the sail for steam while cruising, thus materially reducing the expenses of the navy, and adding greatly to its efficiency. Looking to our future, I recom mend a liberal though not extravagant f'oliey towards this branch of the pub ic service. The report of the Postmaster-General furnishes a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the mail service, and of this part of the Post Office Department. The ordinary postal revenues for the year ending the 30th of June, 18C9, amount to $18,344,510, and the expenditures to $23,689,131, showing an excess of ex penditures over receipts of $5,353,620. The exesss of expenditures over re ceipts for the previous year amounted to $3,437,992. The increase of Reve nues for 1869, over, those of 1863, was $2,051,909, and the increase of expenditures was $967,533. The in creased revenue in 1869 ex ceeded the increased revenue in 1868, by $996,330, and the in creased expenditures in 1809 were 52,527,570 less than the increased expenditures in 18C7, showing by com parison this gratifying feature of im provement; that while tho increase of expenditures over the increase of re ceipts in lSGS was $2,439,535, the in crease of receipts over tho increase of expenditures in 1S09 was $1,034,371. Your attention is respectfully called to the recommendations mado by tho Postmaster General for authority to change the " rate of compensation to the Main Grand Trunk Railroad lines for their services in carrying the mails; for having post route map3 ezecuted; for reorganizing and increasing the effi ciency of the special agency service; for the increase of the mail service; for the increase of the mail service on the Pacific, and for establishing a mail service under the flag of the Union and Atlantic. And more es pecially do I call your attention to his recommendation for the total abolition of the franking privilegs. Thi3 is an abuse from . which do one receives a commensurate advantage. It reduces the receipts for postal service from twenty-five to thirty per cent., and largely increases the service to be performed. . w -The method 5 by i which postage should be paid upon public matter, is set forth fully in the report of the Postmaster General. The report of the Secretary of the Interior shows that the quantity of publio lands disposed of during the year ending the 30th of June, 1S69. was 7,666,152 acres, exceeding that of the preceeding year by 1.010,409 acres. Of this amount, 2,899.544 acres were sold for cash, and 2,737,365 acres were entered under the homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid in the constriction of the work of inter nal improvement, approved to the States as stamp land and located war rants and scrip. . The cash receipts from all sources were,.$4,472,SS6, ex ceeding those of the preceding year $2,840,140. During the last fiscal year, 23,196 , names were added to the Pension and Rol!s,4,873j2ropped there from, leaving at its close 187,963. The amount paid to pensioners, in cluding the compensation of disburs ing agents, was $28,422,884, an increase of $441,192 on that of the previous year. The munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested in legislation for the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the recent struggle to maintain that unity of. the Govern ment which makes us ono people. The addition to the pension rolls of each successive year since the conclusion of hostilities, result in a great degree from the repeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 18G2, which extended its provisions to cases not falling within its original Ecope. The large outlay which is thu oocasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance be stowed since that date upon those ho, while in duty.were wholly or per manently disabled. Publio opinion has given an emphatic sanction 'to these measures of Congress, and it will be conceded that no part or our - public burden 13 more cheerfully borne than that which is imposed by thi3 branch of the service. It necessitates for the next fiscal year, an addition to the amount justly chargeable to the Naval Pension fund, on the ap propriation of $30,000,000. During the year ending the 30th of September, 1809, tho Patent Office issued 13,762 patents, and its receipts were $686,389, being ?21J,U2b more than the expendi tures. I would "respectfully call your attention to the recommenda tion of the Secretary of the Interior for uniting tho duties of supervising the education of freedmen together with the other duties devolving upon the Commissioner of Education, if it is the desire ot Congress. . To make the census, which must be taken during tho year 1870, more complete and perfect than heretofore. I would suggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress, at the last session. appointed a committee to take . . . , . . . into consideration Bucn measures as might be deemed proper in reference to the canvacs, and to report a plan I desist from saying more. I recommend to your favorable no tice tho claims of the Agricultural Bureau for a liberal appropriation. In a country so diversified in climate and soil as ours," and with a popula tion so largely dependent upon agri culture, the benefits that can be conferred by properly fostering this iiurcau are incalculable. I desire, respectfully, to ca'J the attention of Congress to th) inade quate salaries of a number of the most important officers of tbe Government. In this -message, I will not enumerate them, but will specify only tho Justices of tho Su preme Court. No change has been made in their salaries for fifteen years. Within that time the labors of the Court have largely increased, and the expenses of living havo at least doubled. During the same time Congress has twice found it necessary to increase largely tho compensation of its own members; and the duties which it owes to another department of the Government deserves, and will undoubtedly receive, its dno consid eration. There are many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with propriety be introduced, but I abstain, believing your patriotism and states manship will suggest the topics and legislation most conducive to the in terests of the whole people. On my part I promise a rigid adherence to the laws and their strict enforcement. U. S. Grant.
