MESSAGE. Senator Quay's "mailed hand" has already shown itself in national af fairs at Washington. He was the 'warm supporter of Reed for the speak ership and that gentleman owes his place to Quay. The reason why Quay wanted Reed is that he can rely on him to do any thing that will help the radical party. Mr. Reed is an ultra partisan. He hates the South, and he liates the .Democratic party as the devil hates holy water. He is a man of strong intellect and much vior and is just he man of all other to try to bull doze the Democratic minority. That is why Quay wanted him. From these two worthies, Reed in the chair and Quay to turn the crank, we shall be surprised if some high handed election laws, directed against the South, are not soon forthcoming from the congressional mill. In the Senate, Mr. Reed will have many co-workers in any effort he may make to impose unjust laws on the South. They have begun early. As we see in the dispatches from Wash lsgtou. Senators Frye and Chandler were on hand promptly with their lit tie bills for an election law. These bills will be placed on the calendar at the earliest practical moment and will probably come up Boon. We gave the readers of The Sen tinel an outline of Chandler's Dill a few weeks ago. It provides for the appointment of supervisors ot congres sional elections, who shall act ss a can assing board and declare the result ; that voters must be registered, and limits the application of the bill to elections for representatives in Con gress within ths States of South Caro lina, Florida, Mississippi and Loui siana. Senator Sherman's bill provides for the appointment by the President, to be confirmed by the Senate, of a State board of canvassers of five voters and Doara ot three voters in each con gressional district. These boards shall i i i : tu- uunug guuu ueuaviur. iuc 01 ate board shall appoint a registrar of elections in each congressional dis tnct, to serve six years' The district boards shall select three citizens in their respective districts, who shall constitute the judges of elections for all federal elections, to serve six years. Tho district board shall also appoint three commissioners of election for sach'county, city or corresponding po litical division in the congressional district. These commissioners shall canvass the vote. The judges of elec tion shall not all be of one political party. Th Secretary of the Interio shall turnish the registration books. The electoral board of each congres sional District shall in the month of April of each year of a general elec. tion certify to the Secretary of State the number of election districts and number of voters in each, and the Sec retary of State thereupon shall transmit to the board duplicate poll books in each district. Benny Harrison has delivered his message to Congress. It came Tues day and was nothing more nor less than was to have been expected. He touches lightly and deals in the most glittering generalities when discussing the gravest affairs of state. If we could sum up his message in one sen tence it would be about as follows: Senators and members, you who are the guardians of American liberty, go ahead and make as big a show at do ing nothing as possible and don't for get that the Republican party must win next time. It is too little a thing, stretched out too lone to fit The Sentinel's col umns, so we can only touch on one or two points. In the part which may be fairly termed bis own, one striking feature is the recommendation that the Federal Government "take the whole direction and control of the election of members of the House of Representatives." This is a distinct approval of the Sherman Congression al Election bill a most damnable scheme for depriving the South of its coDgressmen an outline of which we print this week. The President's idea of impartiality in the administration of Civil Service may be gleaned from this paragraph : When those holding administrative offices so conduct themselves as to convince just political opponents that no party consideration or bias affects in any way the discharge of their pub lic duties, we can more easily stay the demand for removals. If this does not mean that any Democratic incumbent who desires to remain in place must buy his retention by subserviency to local Republican leaders, politicians will be at a loss to translate the language of their craft. These two are about the only ideas that stick up above the common plain of dull platitudes, and they serve to show that, above all things, Hani- sun is a partisan and desires the sue cess of the Republican party far more than he does the welfare of the Amer ican people. 

SENSATIONAL PREACHING. -ri i ii. ine man woo mages a Da D boon or a bar-room humorist of himself in the pulpit for the sake of notoriety and cash ought to wear stripes instead of being rewarded. On the contrary, the preacher who ministers to his people from year to year, rejoicing in their gladness and weeping in their day of sorrow de serves far better reward than he re- - .1 t m . ceivea at -we nanas oi the average North Carolina community. We are led to these remarks by the act that Bill Fife, the "drummer evangelist" raked in $300 during a two week's "revival" in Reidsville, While the pastor of the church in which he preached receives only $600 per year and, a few weeks before Fife went there, told his people that he actually didn't have money enough to buy a pair of shoes to cover his feet ! This same story has been repeated several times in North Curolina and will go on indefinitely until the peo ple awake to the fact that it isn't, common honesty to starve their home minister while pouring gold into the pockets of a travelling religious moun bank. , Sam Jones may be all right and .Bill life may be an bumble follower k ot the Lord Jesus Christ, but they use language in the pulpit which if used in the parlor would cause them to be kicked into the street, and people go to hear them as they go to the circus to see the spotted clown. When we come to decide where our money thall go, it should not take us long to decide that the local minister is the man we owe it to, rather than to the sensationalist. Stick a pin right , herb, brethren, and don't forget it. THE "BLIND HAN ELOQUENT" RE ELECTED. The opening of the session of Con gre S3, says the Baltimore Sun, was at tended by no surprises until toward the close of the second day's proceed ings in the House. In the House Mr. Reed was made Speaker by a vote of 166 as against 154 for Mr. Carlisle and one for Curamings, of New York. Speaker Reed acknowledged the hon or confered to him in a brief speech, and the session began with everybody in a good humor. A flurry was pro duced, however, when Mr. Cheadle, a republican, bolted the candidate of his caucus for chaplain and moved the substitution of the name of Mr. Mil- burn, the blind Democratic chaplain of the last House, whom the people of Winstcn will recollect, as he lect ured here last spring on "What A Blind Man Saw In Paris." Several republicans joined Cheadle, and with their help the democrats, after a spirit ed struggle, elected Milburn by a vote of 166 to 155. The incident shows how difficult it may be for the repub licans to carry party measures in the present House. Their majority when all members are present being not ov er eight, and under ordinary circum stances likely to fall to two or three, or even disappear altogether, they are subject to all sorts of accidents. The caprice of one offended republican, the sickness of another, the alsence of a third, and an accident to a fourth may at any time break a quorum or fake division result the wrong way. Arbitrary measures with the minori ty are clearly impracticable under the circumstances.

If they can not get their nine members elected in Silver Bow county admitted to the Legislature, as they should be, they can hold the State Senate in a dead lock during ninety days, which is the legal limit of its session. The Demo cratic Governor can thereupon ap point two Democratic United States Senators. The Legislature might, with its rightful Democratic majority, elect two Democrats in the usual way, but the trouble about this is that the rival Republican Legislature would elect two.

Constitution says about trusts: "The cotton-oil trust gives the latest exhibition of internal weakness, it was about . to fall to pieces when the leading certificate hol ders got together, and, to use their own picturesque language, proceeded to 'pump the water' out of the concern. In a total capitalization of $42,000, 000 it was found necessary to pump out $21,000,000 of water; but even tii is heroic treatment doesn't seem to have helped the affair. Its disease is a complication of which dropsy was only an element." The November TJni versity Magazine contains an " exceedingly interesting article on the life and labors of the late Prof. Graves. It is from the facile pen of Prof. Geo. T. Winston, his friend and schoolmate. The centennial eHtion of the Fay etteville Observer is a valuable history of that great event. It contains about 125 engravings and, altogether, U the most creditable paper ever issued by a North Carolina publisher. The Richmond State thinks that ex. President Davis' fine letter to the Fayetteville Centennial "ives evi dence in every line that it sprang from a brain still vigorous in old age and rich in the accumulated learning of many years. .

Hood's Sarsaparilla is a peculiar medicine, possessing, by virtue ot its peculiar combination, proportion, and preparation, curative power superior to any other article.

I told him I knew what . Hood's Sarsaparilla was. I had taken it, was satisfied with it, and did not want any other. Hood's When I began taking Hood's Sarsaparilla I was feeling real miserable, suffering a great deal with dyspepsia, and so weak that at times I could hardly stand. I looked, and had for some time, like a person In con sumption, nood's Sarsaparilla did me so much good that I wonder at myself sometimes, and my friends frequently speak of it." Mas. t.i t.x a.
