INCREASE OF FREIGHT RATES AS MAY BE NECESSARY. I "Fourth, explicit approval by the! C.onKrruM of the consideration by tho , Interstate Commerce. Commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by tho I railroads an may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of tho eixnl-nour uay and .fhlch havo not been offset by administrative read justments and economies, should tho facts dlsclcmed JliHtlfy tho Increase. "Fifth, an amendment of tho exist ing Federal ii tutu to which provide for tho mediation, conciliation, and 1 nruurauon or sucn controversies as the present by adding to It a proTl slon that, In casn tho methods of ac commodation now provided for should fall, a full public Investigation of the merlin of every such dispute shnll be Instituted and completed boforo a strike or lockout may lawfully bo at tempted. "And, sixth, tho lodgement In the hands of tho Hxecutlvn of the power, In ciso of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such rolling stock of tho rnllwayn of the country as may bo required for mili tary use and to operato them for mil itary purposed, with nuthorltv 10 draft Into tho military service of the I nlted .Slates such train crews nnd administrative officials ns the, cir cumstances rcntilro for their safo nnd efficient use. "Tim second and third of thesn recommendations tho Congress Im mediately ncted on: It established the elghl-hour day as tho legal basis of work and wagcH In train service and It authorized the; appointment of a commission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the mensures most Immediately needed; hut It postponed action upon the other suggestions until on oppor tunity should bo offered for n moro deliberate! consideration of them. The fourth recommendation I do not deem II necessary to renew. The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an Inereoso of rates on the ground referred to Is Imllsputnhly clear and a rernmmendatlon by tho Congress with regard to such a mat ter might seem to draw In question the scope of (ho Commission's au thority nr Its Inclination to do Justice when Micro Is no reason to doubt either. 

MORE POWERS FOR THE INTER STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION. "The other suggestions the In crease In tho Interstate Commcrco Commission's membership and In Its facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full nulilln (Investigation und assessment of In dustrial disputes, and tho grant to nn, r.xcruiivti or urn power lo control ami operato tho railways when neces sary In time of war or other llko public necessity I now very earnest ly i enow. "The necessity for such legislation Is manifest anil pressing. Those who have entrusted us with tho respon sibility and duty of serving and safe guarding them In such matters would ; find It hard, I believe, to exuuso u raiiuro to act upon these gravo mat lets or nny unnecessary postponement of action upon them. "Not only does the Interstate Com merce Commission now find it prac tically Impossible, with Its present membership und oiganlzatlou, to per form Its great functions promptly nnd thoroughly, but It Is not unlikely that It may presently bo found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first bo perfected as an ndmiulstratlvo in strument. "Tho country cannot and should not consent to remain nny longer ex posed to profound Industrial disturb ances for lack of additional means of arbitration and conciliation which tho Congress can easily nnd promptly supply. And all will agree that there must bo no doubt as to the power of the Kxecutlve to mako Immediate and tin ntciTiipted'tiso of the railroads for thi' concentration of the military forces of tho nation wherever they arc needed and whenever they nro needed. "This Is u programme of regulation, prevention and ndmiulstratlvo effi ciency which argues Its own caso in the mero statemunt of It. With re gard to one of Its items, the tncreaso In tho efficiency of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the House of Itipreseiit.itlves has already acted; Its action needs only tho concurrence 'f tho Kuiate. 

WOULD HESITATE TO OPPOSE LABOR'S RIGHTS. "I would hesitate to recommend, .ind 1 dare say the Congress tvouhl 'ust,itt to act upon the suggestion should I innko It, that any man In iny occupation should be obliged by l.nv to contlnuo In an employment walch he Uiilrcd to leave To pass a law which forbade or prevented tho individual woikman to leave his work before receiving tho approval of so ciety In doing so would be to adopt a new principle Into our Jurisprudence which 1 take It for granted we uro not prepared to introduce. "Hut tho propositi that tho opera tion of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by tho concerted action of nrgan'-ed bodies of men until a public luvestlga t.on shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion ot the nation is not to piuposo any such prluiiple, It Is based upon tho very ililferent principle that tho con certed action of powerful bodies ot men shall not bo permitted to stop the Industrial processes of tho nation. , at any rate iieforo the nation shall liuM' had an opportunity to acquaint IImK with the merits of the cimi as ; Dtiwein etuployeo alul employer, lime llo form Its opinion upon an impartial .-i.iuiiient ot llii- murits, ami oppor tunity to consider all practicable iiiuaiis of conciliation or arbitration. i "i i. in sco nothing in that proposi tion but the Justillable safeguarding by .society of the necessary processes of Its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in It unless It bo arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and i should bo ilono with a full and scrupu lous regard for the Interests and lib erties of all concerned as well as for the permanent Inteiests of society , Itself. Thrcn matters of rnpltal Impor tance await tho notion of tho Senate PRESSING MEASURES URGED IN THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE In his; address to Congress thin nftornoon President Wilson recom mended tho passage of legislation to prevent a naUori-wido railway striko or lockout beforo thcro hnj beon opportunity for Investigation, but de fended It against tho attack of organized labor as nothing arbitrary or unjust and tho "Justifiable safeguarding by society of tho necessary processes of its very life." Ho took tho position that "tho power of tho Interstate Commcrco Commission to grant nn lncrcaso of freight rates to tho railroads Is In disputably clear, and a recommendation by Congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question tho scopo of tho commission's authority or Its Inclination to do Justlco when thero Is no reason to doubt either." Ho also urged tho passage of tho Webb bill, w'hleh favors tho Icgnl lzatlon of Amwlcan collective selling agencies abroad to build up our foreign commerce. Ho favored tho pannage of the Porto Itlcan Government bill which would give a further meed of liberty to that possession. drew his ohargo and the cao was dismissed.

I need not labor my advice that theao measures bo enacted Into law. Their urgency lies Jn tho manifest circum stances whloh render their adoption at thin time not only opportune but nocossary. Even delay would serious ly Jeopard tho Interests of tho country and of tho Govornmont. "Immcdlato passage of the bill to regulato tho expenditure of money In elections may seem to bo loss neces sary than tho immediate enactment of the other measures to which I re fer; becauso at least two years will elapso beforo another election in which Federal ofllces are to bo tilled; but It would greatly relievo tho pub lic mind If this Important matter wero dealt with whllo the circumstances and tho dangers to tho public morals of tho present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and tho methods of expenditure can bn frankly studied in tho light of present experience; and a delay would have tho further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another election was at hand and some special object counoctcd with It might bo thought to bo in tho mind of thoso who urged It. Action can bo taken now with facts for guldanco nnd without suspicion of partisan purpose. 

SPEEDY STEPS TO BUILD UP OUR EXPORT TRADE. "I shall not arguo at length the de sirability of giving a freer hand In tho matter of combined nnd con certed effort to thoso who shall un dertake tho essential enterprise ot building up our export trade. That entorprlso has already assumed a magnitude unjfrcccdonted In our ex perlence. We havo not tho necessary Instrumentalities for Its prosecution; It Is deemed to bo doubtful whether they could bo created upon nn nd 'iliate scale under our present laws. Wo should clear away nil legal ob stncles und crento a basis of un doubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregu lated license. The thlajt must be dona now, because tho opportunity is here and may escape us If we heal tato or delay. "The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto Illco Is brief und conclusive. Tho present laws governing the Island and regulating tho rights and privi leges of Its people are not Just. We havo created expectations of extend ed prlvilcgo which wo have not sat isfied. Thcro Is uneasiness, among the people of tho Island, and cvon a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the ndoptlon of the pending measure would happily remove. Wo do not doubt what wo wish to do In any essential particular. We ought to do It at once, "At tho last session of tho Con gress a bill was passed by tho Senate which provides for tho promotion of vocational and Industrial education, which Is of vital Importance to tho whole country because It concerns a matter, too long neglected, upon which tho thorough Industrial preparation of tho country for tho critical years of cccnomlc development Immediately ahead of us In very largo mcasuro do pends. "May I not urge Its early and fnvor Ablo consideration by tho Houso of Representatives nnd Its early ennct ment Into law? It contains plans which nffect nil Interests and alt paits of tho country and I am sure that thero Is no legislation now pending before tho Congress whose passage the coun try awaits with moro thoughtful ap proval or greater Impntlcnco to see a great nnd admirable thing set In tho way of being done." "Thero are other matters ulrendy advnnced to tho stage of conferonco betweon fho two Houses of whleh It Is not necessary that I should speak. Somo practicable basis of agreement concerning thorn will no doubt bo found nnd action taken upon them, "Inasmuch as this Is, Gentlemen, probably tho last occasion I shall havo to address the Sixty-fourth Con gress, I hope that you will permit mo to 6ny with what genuine pleasure and satisfaction I havo oo-operated with you In tho many measures of constructive policy with which you havo enriched tho legislative annals of tho country. It has been a privi lege to labor In such company, I tnke tho liberty of congratulating you upon Uio complotlon of a record of raro sorvlceablencss and distinction." 'I
