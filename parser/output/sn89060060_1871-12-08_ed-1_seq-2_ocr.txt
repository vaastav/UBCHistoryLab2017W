DECEMBER 8. 1871. cane toward* th*store; Norris lives in eight of the store, not more than two hundred yards; when B*il got within thirty yards of tbe main eoad, coming towards tbe store, I was in the public road; I called to Bell and told him Norris was coming; Bell replied, “I don't care a d— —n if be is, I will fight him if he comes after me;” after telling him that, I went to the store; Bell continued on and had cross ed tbe public road coming in the direction of tbe atore when L told bim if he was going to fight he must not come any closer to the store; Bell then stopped; by that time Norris had got to the fence; the fence was not over ten or fifteen .yards from the centre of the road; as Norris was getting over the fence he re marked, “What’s the matter Walbert?”—just in that way ; both were then equidistant from the road ; aftee Norris made tbe remark, both parties advanced towards each other, meeting nearly in the centre of the road ; Norris then took his pistol out, from under his coat or arm I think and deliberately shot him; they were just near enough to earn other to allow Norris to straighten out his wrro; after shooting, Nor ria went off towards his home and immediate ly returned towards the store; my son pro posed to shut tbe door and did so; when Norris came op I said, “Yon seem to be des perate. you have killed that man, haven’t you?" Norris replied, “Yes, I have killed him. and 1 intended to kill bim ;” Bell was shot immediately under the navel and didn’t live over twenty minutes; he took two steps after be was shot and eased himself over on his bauds and knees and stretched himself out on tbe ground on his belly; it is forty-five strides from the piazza of the store to the road;'l was standing in tbe store door when I saw tbe shooting; he fell immediately in front of tbe store; as soon as Norris left Bell called roe, saying, “Oh, Captain;” I went to him and said, “Walbert, are you shot?” he said, “Yes, sir, 1 have it into me,” and asked me to send for a doctor; this was all he said, he was dying then; I sent for Dr. Smoot. Croas examined—Norris’ bouse is not over two hundred yards from (he road and nearly opposite the “Lot;” Norris’ house and the store are both on elevations, a ravine between; when he knocked at tbe dour, 1 said, “Wash, I am afraid to let you in, you seem to be des perate,” but immediately let him in; the piaz- Ea is eight-feet wide; when he came in be seemed' greatly excited but had no pistol • r other weapon on him; staid only five minutes and.went up the road; the quarrel was slight, neither seeming disposed to fight; when Bell went towards the house he talked and seemed to cool down; when they met in the road, Bell had nothing in bis band; tbe coroner’s jnry met next morning. Bell had nothing a bout him; was thinly dressed; both were un der the influence of liquor, although 1 didn’t see either drink ; they were both apparently on friendly terms; I noticed no gestures on the part of Bell as be approached Norris; Bell was evidently disposed to make up; Bell was coming towards the store when he said, “I will fight bim if be comes after me;” that was the only expression I heard ; I stood iu tbe store door and beard and saw all that passed. Rufus Perry, for State, was tbe next wit ness. He testified: On the BUi of Novem ber bad been from homo; returned about 4J o’clock; saw Bell and Norris disputing; the fence was between them; Bell came to me and ■aid, “Dr. Wilmer gave Norris twenty-five dollars for a breakfast” and then said some thing about Norris’ pocketing it; Bell then went back to the fence where Norris was and they disputed; Norris started towards bis house and Bell started to follow; Norris ordered him not to come; Beil said be would go on bis good behavior, both moved on, Bell walking moderately, Norris very fast; Norris went into his bouse and came out with a gun in bis bands and ordered Bell to bait; be said if be (Bell) advanced any further be would about bim; Bell did bait and they seeyned to disput for five minutes; Norris then sent the gun back to the boose;- Bell then advanced close to Norris and they talked together in a very low tone for five minutes; immediately after wards Bell came back towards tbe store, talk ing violently and gesticulating as if be was an gry with some one; Bell said any man who did (so-and-so) was a d—d son of a b—b; Norris immediately demanded what be said; Beil con tinued towards tbe store; Norris went back iuto the boose and came out immediately; saw him run something into bis bosom; he then pursued Bell; Bell got to tbe road first and attempted to come to the store; Pa told him if they were going to fight, they must end it in tbe road; Bell then threw down a small stick, which be had on bis shoulder with a small bundle on it, and walked into the road; the moment be got there Norris walked di rectly up to bim, pulled bis pistol out of hi* bosom and fired at bim, killed him, then turn ed and walked home again; Bell then called my father apd we both walked down there; be was then on tbe ground; laid himself down; be didn’t fall; tbe ball struck bim just under tbe navel; supposed he lived thirty minutes; went back to the store and saw Norris com ing again towards the store; we abut tbe door and refused to let bim in; after a short time Pa let him in; one of us said, “You have killed that poor fellow down there and we are al most afraid to let you in j” he said , “If 1 didn’t kill him I intended .to ;” 1 examined bim but found no arms. Cross examined—Bell and Norris were both at the store that morning; 1 left about 2 P. M.; saw them take a drink together; Norris offer ed no objection to bis being searched; wanted us to take off all his clothes; he didn’t seem ai all frightened; staid in tbe store about five minutes; I do not drink; he started up the road immediately after we advised him to *<• to Smoot (the officer): Norris did not say that Bell bad a knife in bis band; saw Bell pu: down bis stick and bundle; in the store Nor ris said “If I have not killed Bell I intended to do it;” did nut think bim excited; I -was cool as usual; I closed the door for fear he might shoot me; 1 bad a dispute with bim myself previously; when Niirris went after the gup, I, from curiosity, went up on tue bill; after Bell laid down his bundle be advanced towards Norris in a friendly way; if Bell said anything I did not hear it; after Norris came to tbe store I don’t think father left me until Norris left. Redirect examination —I am not positively certain that father staid in tbe store with me until Norris left; as Norris came out of bis bouse be wss running something in bis breast and walked after Bell very excited ; I was on tbe bill and could see every thing that took place. ~R. G. Harris, for State, testified: Saw Norrira short distance from where the killing took place on that day. 1. was riding, be walking; I bad pssaed him; ho called me hack; b said, “Master Bennie, yon say you are no friend of mine, but you will have to be, because I have killed a d—d nigger.” Cross examined —He waa going up tbe rokd •' he said h was Walbert Bell, yonder be hyp: Humphrey, for Stale, testified : As I pass ed, Walbert was saying something about the breakfast; 1 talked to him. he seemed grieved and shed tears ; 1 caught Norris, but he pass ed od very fast, jumped the fence and said, “How, Walbert, what’s the matter 7” He overtook me and said, “Yes; I have shot him, killed him dead ; 1 have killed one d—n nig ger and will kill another, white or black ;” saw him shoot Bell; he had the pistol in his breast; 1 was out far from the fence. Cross examined —They didn’t appear to be angry, nothing like fighting. Dr. A. J. Smoot, for State, testified; Did not find the ball; jury expressed themselves satisfied as to cause of death and 1 examined no further. WITNESSES FOB DEFENCE. The State here closed its case and Lemuel Smoot was called for the defence and testifi ed: Norris delivered himself up, saying he had shot a man but didn’t know if he was dead. Joseph Norris, (son of the prisoner,) for defence, testified: Saw Bell Saturday before the election; he called me out and said he had taken father for a friend of his, but he was a d—-d rascal, having Republican breakfasts, pretending he was a Republican ; that the Harrises were assisting him to persuade his son to vote the Democratic ticket, and if it was so, he would kill him; told father on Sunday Bell was using threats against him and would kill him ; didn’t tell him what the threats were. Andrew Boar man,.for defence, testified : Bell was one of the most powerful rueu in that part of the county; his reputation fur quiet was nut good. Doctors B. Neale and F, M. Lancaster were examined for defence, but nothing important was elicited. The case was here closed on both sides and the argument commenced before the jury. About 8 o’clock P. M. the jury retired, and at 12 M. on Thursday returned a verdict of “Guilty of murder in the first degree.” At tbe rendition of this verdict the prisoner appeared entirely unconcerned. Messrs. Stone and Edelen immediately gave notice of their intention to move for a new trial, and shortly afterwards filed the reasons setting forth, in the main, that tbe jury, in making up their verdict, bad mistaken both the law and the evidence. His Honor, Judge Ford, notified tbe counsel that he would hear the argument upon tbe motion next morning (Friday). At tbe meeting of the Court on Friday able and elaborate arguments were made by Messrs, Slone and Edelen in support of, and by Eu gene Digges, Esq., in opposition to, tbe mo tion, and on Saturday morning Judge Ford rendered bis decision granting the motion.— In rendering his opinion Judge Ford express ed himself as perfectly satisfied that the case did not come within the true construction of tbe act of Assembly of 1809, now incorporat ed in the Code, which defined murder in the first degree as “any wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing,” in other words, that tbe killing in this case lacked that wilful intent which is necessary to constitute the grade of murder in the first degree. Lacking the essential element of intent, tbe case, His Honor remarked, was clearly mnrder in tbe second degree. Tbe motion was therefore granted and the prisoner remanded to jail.— An agreement, we understand, has been en tered into between counsel, by which tbe prisoner will plead guilty of murder in the second degree, and it is probable that tbe sentence will be pronounced and the prisoner forwarded to the Penitentiary between this time and Christmas. A Synopsis of the President’s Message. In the opening paragraph General Grant expresses bis gratification at the success which has attended bis efforts to enforce the laws, without inquiring into the - wisdom of their enactment. The past year, we are told, has been one of unexampled prosperity to “the nation,” and, although attended with more than usual chas tisements by storm and fire, these disasters have developed the best elements of human nature in our midst, and tbe friendship of for eign nations. Our relations with foreign Powers are said to be friendly, and the year has been distinguished by the fine example which has been set, of consenting to peace fully arbitrate the Alabama claims. A copy of the treaty is submitted with details in re gard to the appointment of arbitrators, and legislation by Congress is requested at as early a day as possible on those articles of tbe treaty that relate to the fisheries. The hope is also expressed that the Western States bordering on the lakes will act on that article of the treaty which contemplates the use, in com mon, of their canals and rivers and those of Canada.- Mr. Washburne and the Consular Repre sentatives of the United States are next com plimented on tbe delicacy, prudence, and good taste, with which they extended protection to the Germans in France. The rarification ol a new treaty with Italy is announced, one ar ticle of which provides that in case of war be tween the two contracting Powers, private property at sea shall be respected. The mix ed Commission, authorized for adjudicating claims against Spain, growing out of the Cuban insurrection, is said to have been appointed. Tbe friendly relations with Russia, tbe visit ol the Grand Duke Alexis, and the Catacazy quarrel, are adverted to. Also, tbe disinter ested relations of tbe United States with Japan and China. The difficulty with Corea is touch ed upon slightly, and the subject left to Con gress for further action. There is some trou ble with Mexico in regard to the “Free Zone,” which, it is hoped, may be settled amicably ; but our relations with the Central and South American States are reported to be “cordial and friendly”—with one exception. Brazil is congratulated for taking the. first step to wards abolishing slavery, and tbe hope is ex pressed that tbe latter may yet consent to e maneipate the blacks mere rapidly than tbe present act warrants. After some moral re flections, the Message calls special attention to the fact that some citizens of the United States iu foreign countries are slaveholders, and Con gress is recommended to provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the hold ing, owning or dealing in slaves, or being in terested in slave property in foreign lands, either as owners, heirs or mortgagees. The condition of Cuba is represented to be a source of annoyance and anxiety, and a naval force has been sent into Cuban waters to protect the lives and projierty of American citizens, “and maintain the dignity of the Hag.” ' The reduction of the National debt during the past year is alluded to; but as it is not thought to be any longer desirable that the present resources of the country should be tax ed to continue this rapid payment, it is re commended that all taxes (tom internal reve nue sources be abolished, except those collect ed from spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms and from stamps; and that other articles, not produced at home, but which either enter largely into general Consumption, through articles which are man ufactured at home, such as medicines, com pounds, &c., &c., from which very little rev enue is received, be placed on the free list. — It is further suggested that in future there shall be no allowance made to revenue offi cials tor seizures made at the port of entry, but that instead, their salaries be increased. The attention of Congress is called to Jhe gold gambling mania, and the proposition is solemnly laid down that it is very desirable to give a fixed value to our currency. Concerning the operations of the army. Congress is referred to the report of the Sec retary of War; but some suggestions arc made in regard to promotions. The efficiency of the navy is said to have been increased dur ing the past year, and Congress is recommend ed to consider the suggestions of the Secreta ry, and to authorize promotions by selection in future, instead of by seniority. The Post-office report is said to show enlarg ed receipts from mail service, and although the expenditures were much greater than the receipts, the hope is expressed that, someday or other, the Postoffice Department will prove A much greater blessing to the people than it is now. The proposition to unite the tele graph system with the postal system is espe cially recoin mended, A defence of the Ku-Kltix act, and its en forcement follows next. The proclamation of martial law in nine counties of Sonth Carolina is declared to have been an impera tive necessity, and the old stories of outrages perpetrated, and of “combinations too power lul” for the State authorities to resist, are re hashed and dilated upon. The Polygamists of Utah are said to have been justly dealt with and ’"the majesty of the law sustained.” But Congress is asked to authorize the Territorial Legislature to de clare the legitimacy of all children born prior to a time fixed in tbe act. Tbe Indian peace policy is said to have been aitended with favorable results, and lib eral appropriations are recommended for the purpose of carrying it out more fully than heretofore. Some platitudes then follow about regard ing tbe public lands as a heritage to our chil dren, and that they be disposed of only to actual seftlers. Tbe Census, and the operations of the Bu reaus, are next touched upon briefly as pre liminary to asking an increase of salaries for the Heads of Bureaus and officials holding positions of responsibility. It is submitted to Congress whether the time has not passed for granting entire am nesty to those (Southerners who are now de prived of the right to bold office. The dis turbed condition of the Southern States is re ferred to. and tbe restoration of the leading men to the rights of which they are now de prived, suggested as both advisable and poli tic. But, it is added: “If there are any great criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took in opposition to tbe Gov ernment, they might, in the judgment of Con gress, be excluded from such amnesty.” The remainder of the Message is made up of matters relating to the District of Colum bia; the Chicsigo fire; Immigrants, and laws for their better protection ; recommendation to office; dishonest officials, and civil service reform, on none of which topics is anything said of any special importance. — Balt.
