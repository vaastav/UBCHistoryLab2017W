[FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] coLfMBiA, December 4. FI HST CHAPTER IN REFORM. Mr. Crittenden, a Reformer from Greenville, on Friday, introduced the following resolution: Resolved, That the Judiciary committee be In? structed to report a bill reducing the salaries of county school commissioners and the pay of county commissioners to a sum conmens?rate with the duties they perform. On this he made a few remarks. He seid: Hie reductjsn of the salary, of school commissioners and pay of county commissioner.? ls a subject which I hope will commend itself to the favorable consideration of every member on this floor, lt will reflect credit upon the General Assembly. It i is one of those minor measures of reform which will be understood by thoughtful men of both parties throughout the State. If we are to reduce taxation, we must do it by reduc? ing the expenses of the State; Government. The salaries of the county school commissioners are entirely disproportional to the services they are called upon to perform. I know that the labor ls no.v being performed by the school trus? tees without fee or reward. I desire here to say that I am In favor of a most liberal system of popular education. I would have a system which' would benefit every class and> race alike. I am happy to say that I agree with Governor Scott in his recommendation on this matter, as I do with the many recommendations which he has made in his excellent message. He has called npon men of all parties and classes to support the gov? ernment In all right efforts. I am one of those men. And I believe In doing so I shall truly rep? resent the sentiment of the people who have sent me here from Greenville. Mr. Mobley, of course, moved to lay this on the \ab!e. ANOTHER VERNON INVESTIGATION. Uncle Joe Crews again wants Judge Vernon im? peached. It will be remembered that last winter several unsuccessful attempts were made to Im? peach this Judge, all of which fell through. When the resolution was presented, one mem? ber wanted lt referred to the committee on vacant offices^ but the speaker suggested that, although it mtgnt be desired to make these offices vacant, they were not so yet, and such a reference would be irregular. There was some trouble in refer? ring lt to a committee. Mr. Boston desired the resolution passed at once. Ue had seen enough of referring to committees. Sime matters seem? ed to fctay referred. Crews favored a special committee of men liv? ing In that part of the county. He knew that Judge Vernon and the sheriff were guilty of mis? demeanors, and that both of them were engaged in the late riot. An order had been issued by Ver? non placing the arms taken out of his house In the hands of aa armed mob. He thought a com? mittee should be selected who would investigate the matter much better than a geueral com? mittee. There was a decided objection to having lt re? ferred to the judiciary committee. Mr. Smart, as a member of the Judiciary committee, hoped to get nd or the matter, and would be glad to have it brought before the House la proper shape. The resolution was adopted. ENGROSSING CLERKS. There seems to be some Jerrymandering going on in regard to the appointment of engrossing clerks. Last year the matter was in the hands of the secretary of State, by a resolution, and six clerks were employed. It seems" now to be the desire to appoint nine, and to make a separate department. On a resolution which came up. Thursday, the proviso of which limited the num? ber to nine, Mr. Byas spoke in favor of striking the fftpviso out. The matter very likely will be placet under the supervision of the clerks of each house. ' SCHOOL ACT AMENDED. The bill Introduced by Whittemore, amending the act establishing and maintaining a system-ol free common schools, has some excellent pro? visions. Section 1 of the bill repeals section 4 or the act relating to rurnlshihg school books. Section 2 amends section 21 or the act by provi? ding that tho county school commi'Stoner shall, before entering upon the duties of his office, give bond, Tor the use or the county In which he ls elected, for educational purposes, in the penal sum of twice the amount of his annual salary, with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the county commissioners, conditioned for the ruthrul and Impartial discharge of the duties or his office. Section 3 amends section 26, so as to read as follows : "That should he rai! to make the report required In the preceding section, he shall rorrelt to the school fund or his county his annual salary, and shall also be liable for all damages caused by such failure." Section 28 ls amended so that each county school commissioner shall receive an annual salary of two hundred dollars, except the school commissioner ror' Charleston County, who shall receive an-annual salary or three hundred dollars, payable quarterly by the State treasurer; and that each county school commissioner shall re? ceive Ave cents ror each mile or necessary travel in the perrormancc cf his official d.ities, such mileage to be stated in detail and attested by his oath. COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS AND TELEGRAPHS. By the bill Intro luc2d by Arnim the other day to provide for the appointment or a commissioner or railroads and telegraphs, and to prescribe his duties, this officer is appointed by the Governor, by and with the consent of the Senate. He shall hold office for two years; shall have no official connection with any railroad, nor during the term ol bis office own or. be interested in any stock or bonds. The Governor has power to re? move or suspend. The commissioner has a salary or $2300, and a clerk at $800. He ha3 a free pass on nil railroads. His duties are to report any violations or the law, and to.prosecute their. Whenever the com? missioner shall hive reasonable grounds to be? lieve, elther-on'complaint or otherwise, that any ot the track, bridges, or other structures ol any railroad in this State are in a condition which renders any or them dangerous or unfit for the transportation of passengers with reason? able Fafety.lt shall be his duty to give to the superintendent or other executive officer of the company working or operating said defective track, bridge or other structure notice of the con? dition thereor, and or thc repairs necessary to place the same In a reasonably safe condition, and may also order and direct the rate of speed or passing trains over such dangerous or derect ive track, bridge or other structure, until the said repairs are made, and the time within which re? pairs shall be made by the company. ITany superin? tendent shall willully neglect to direct the proper subordinate officers to run the passenger trains over such defective track, bridge or other struc? ture at the speed so specified by the commission? er, or if any engineer, conductor or other em? ployee or such company shall kuowingly disobey such ord-r, every such superintended, officer and couductor or employee shall bc deemed guilty o? a misdemeanor. Sections 7 and 8 provide for prosecution against railroad companies. Section 9 makes lt the duty of the president or each and every railroad company in this State, annually, during the month or October, to pre? pare and transmit to Ihe commissioner a full and true statement, under oith, of its affairs for the preceding year, ending on the nrst Monday in July. The commissioner must report annually. TBE

Ou lo ikiiig up that something was plainly visible on the sumen: of the steeple, in the shape of three or four workmen, tearing up the tempo? rary roof and throwing down timber and bricks as If they were mad. This is the inception or the work which is expected to accomplish the total overthrow of the steeple and circular wails which have stood so long bet?re our community as tho monuments of the destructive ravages or the great conflagration or '02. Tne bricks are to be all cleaned aud either sold or used In the erection of another and larger pla.-e of worship, more suitable to the size and wealth of the con? gregation. lt has been ascertained, by experi? ments on the strictest philosophical principles, that a brick faffing from such a height as tbe steeple In question acquires sufficient velocity to cru3h any pericranium of reasonable thickness, provided, always, the brick be harder than the pericranium. Alt persons, therefore, whose heads are not harder than brick-?, will govern them? selves accordingly, and keep on the other s:de of the street.

GOVERNOR SCOTT'S PROTEGES.-Bately Riley and diaries Prescott were lodged In the Guard house on Sunday evenin; charged with the lar? ceny of a revolver belonging to her Maje3ty, the State of South Carolina. On examination, lt seems that these two worthies are members o' that promising colony which the Governor lately gathered inra among the Bowery Boys of New Ttork and brought to this State to work the Dorn gold mines, in Onion County. They say that they came to Columbia to act as constables, and that they have not had any work or pay since their ar? rival. In this state of affairs the two determined to run the blockade, and jumped on the Charles? ton train at Columbia on Saturday night. Not having any money to pay their way to Charleston, they pawned the only valuable piece of property in their possession, which was a fine revolver be? longing to the State Itself. Tne weapon betrayed them, and, In the hands of our detectives, soon led to the arrest of these "lost sheep," who have been turned over to the State. They say that they never went near any mines, but that the rest of the "gang" is now on Its way up to Union to look iuto' affairs up there, accompanied by a coinpaoy of soldiers. The two are willing to do anything for pay, aud would like to lump every? thing aud join their comrades on thc Unloa raid. A 

CHANCE TO GET ELEUAXT CHRISTMAS PRESENT?.-Tne fondness of the American public for pictures ls proverbial, and of the elegant and expensive palutiugs which are executed abroad a large proportion Hud their way to our shores. The Invention of the chromo has opeued a source ror the supply of good pictures at a very ?ow rate to those who cannot afford to pay the high prices for genuine o'.l paintings. Tue business of repro? ducing the best works of art by the chromo pro? cess is a very large and successful one, and very great numbers are annually produced, which are very close imitations of the originals, au I Jill a want long reit by our people. A few years 9luce, we were almost entirely without any cheap pic? tures which were worthy or being hang ? in any respectable dwelling, and the only class of engravings worth purchasing at all were import? ed. Now the case is very different, and homes may be made cheerrul by really meritorious works or art at low prices. The most elegant collection of chromos that has yet been seen In Charleston has just been opened ror exhibition at the gallery or yuinby & Co., King street, opposite Hasel. The pictures composing it are not or the cheap and common kinds, bnt the most choice and expensive chromos to be had in the Northern and European markets. They have been selected by competent Jadges as the be3t suited In every way Tor holiday presents, and are all richly and handsomely framed. It has been determined (see advertisement) to close out the whole collec? tion, at auction, without reserve, on Friday next. As this will probably be the last public sale of chromos by Messrs. Qulnby & Co., persons wish? ing to secura the best pictures, at the lowest figures, will do well to attend. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Some New Ideas About thc Alabama Claims-The Canadian Dominion Snubbed-Hankering after St. Domin? go-.v Conditional Ailvocacy of Reve? nue Reform. WASHINGTON, December 5. . In the House, Dixon, of North Carolina, was seated on thc old oath, his disabilities having been removed. Platt, of Virginia, moved that Duke's credeL tlals bs referred to.the committee on elections. Lost. A resolution that Duke qnaliry passed. Notice was given by Reeve3 of contest. In the Senate, the usual opening formalities took place. In the House of Representatives one hundred and seventy-three members answered to thc roll. Dukes wa* seated, having taken the oath, sy pher was seated from the First Louisiana Dis? trict. The President's message after congratulating the country on Its peace and tts prospects for the future, asserts that, by violence and Intimidation , the free exercise or the elective franchls2 had been denied to citlz-ns in general in places lately In rebellion, and the verdict ofthe people thereby reversed. Referring to the European war, the President speaks of the satlsftctory manner In , which theprotection or the American Minister at Paris was extended to German subjects in France. In regard to the proclamation ora French Repub? lic, he says that, should the present struggle re? sult In attaching the French people to the simpler forms of Republican government,!: will be a source offurther satisfaction to the American people, who should not be Indifferent to tin ?pread or American political Ideas In a great and highly civilized country like France. If an opportunity presents Itseir to Interpose the good offices or the United States to restore peace, that action should be heartily taken. In Cuba, he says that the con? dition j>[ the Insurrection has not materially changed, and he renews his recommendation to annex San Domingo.. He says that as soon ns it ls known that the project ls abandoned by the United States, negotiations will be opened by some or Hie European powers for the possession of the Bay of Samaua. He urges the early action or Congress on this matter, and suggests that by a Joint resolution of both houses, the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotiate a treaty with the authorities or San Domingo for the acquisition of that island, and that au appropriation be made to defray the ex? penses or the commission. The question might then be determined-either by the action or the Senate on the treaty, or by the action or both houses on a resolution or annexation, as In thc case ol Texas. The attention or Congress ls called to the extension or the Mexican free zone, also to thc Tien-Tsln massacre. In regari to the Alabama claims, he recom ? mends that Congress authorize a commission to take proofs as to these claims, and that authority be given for their settlement by the United States, so that the government shall have ownership of the private claims, as well as the resp nslblc con? trol or all the demands against Great Britain. In regard to the Canadian fisheries, he com? plains that the course ol the Canadian authorities has not been marked by friendly feeling, and he Intimates that, if they should attempt to enforce a certain act of the Dominion Parliament, it will be his duty to take such steps as msy be necessary to protect the interests of citizens or the United States. He asks that power be conferred upon hun to sus? pend the operation or laws authorizing the transit or merchandise, In bond, throagh the United States to Canada; and also to suspend the opera? tion or any laws -whereby the vessels or the Do? minion are permitted to enter the waters or the United States. He ulso complains or the preten? sions or Canada to control the navigation or the St. Lawrence, and argues the Importance and the right or the United States to navigate that river without let or hindrance. ~ In resard to the depressed condition of the commerce of the United States, he recommends a liberal policy towards the Pacific Mall Steamship Company between California and China and Japan, and recommends that measures be taken to permit American merchants to purchase ves? sels built abroad as well os to encourage Araerl can ship-bulhl lng. In regard to the currency, the President says that the approach to a specie basis ls very grati? fying; but the Instability or the currency ls very prejudicial to prosperity. He thinks that thc time has arrived when, by wise and prudent legisla? tion, Congress s hould look to a policy which would place the currency at par with gold at no distant date. In regard to revenue reform, he says, that if it means to keep the revenue down to what ls nec? essary for the support of government, and for the payment of the Interest oa the public debt It has his hearty support; but If lt means a rallure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of the government, he ls opposed to lt. Revenue reform, ne says, has not been defined by Its advocates, lt seems, however, to be ac? cepted as something which ls to supply every man's wants without' any cost or effort on his part. [Laughter.] He recommends the abolition of the franking privilege and reform in the civil service, particu? larly as to the mode of appointing subordinate officials. ; Afier fie reading or the message the House ad? journed. In the Senate the various routine business was transacted, Including the Introduction or bills, to constitute Shreveport, La., a port ot delivery, and for the removal of political disabilities ol citizens br Louisiana, and to abolish Income taxes. After the reading or the President's message, adjourned. The reading or the message caused no sensa? tion, and there was but reeble applause af the close._
