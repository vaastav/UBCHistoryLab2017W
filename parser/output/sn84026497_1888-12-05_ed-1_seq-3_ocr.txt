THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WINN. tbltOft 4 PROPftltTOH. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 18S8. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. If President CleveUnd't message of a year ago was confined tJ the one subject of tariff reform, ttie document Rent to the Congress on Monday fully makes up for the subjects then omitted. The "stale of the Union" is pretty thoroughly discussed, and if any point of interest of the affairs of the nation is omitted, unless it be the Civil Ser vice refurm, we fail to detect it. In stead of being the message of Presi dent about to retire from public life one whose policy has been repudiated by the people it reads like a docu ment of a roan with the greater part of a term yet to serve, aod who lays out an elaborate programme of reform. It might pertinently be asked, why did not the Democratic party, when io power, accomplish some of these re forms, or at least make attempts which would command the confidence of the people? The protective tariff receives a great deal of atteLlion. Whilo Grover Cleveland as a candidate for re elec tion was "no free-trader," as a man about to retire from public life his free trade sentiments are very clearly expressed. lie attacks the protective system as a violation of the Constitution 'the compact between the Government and the people, and predicts that all class es of society will rise to destroy it He talks glibly of equal rights of cit izenship ; of poverty and wealth ; of the fortunes of manufacturers being exacted from the masses of the people; nbout trusts, combinations, and mo nopolies ; of the broken bond of the Government with the people; and, letting his feelings outrun bis judg ment, be says: Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace to peace and organized gov ernment; but the communism of com bined wealth and capital, the out growth of overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously uuder- mines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not less dangerous than the coiumunisru of oppteesed poverty and toil, which, exasperated by injus tice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule. The President detects a tendency to extend the federal power into the do main of State and local jurisdiction, says it must be checked, and passes on to quoto with approval and presuma bly to apply to himself Andrew Jack son's declaration : "The ambition which leads me on is an anxious de sire and a fixed determination to re' store to the people, unimpaired, the sacred trust they have confided to my charge," etc. Mr. Cleveland then mentions the constitutional provision requiring the President to give to Congress informa tion as to the state of the Union, and proceeds to tell what has happened since his last annual message, and to review the international questions set tled and unsettled. He mentions the rejection of the Fisheries treaty by the Senate, and then says that do case of unlawful treatment of American vessels by Canada has been reported since March 3, 1887, in which repara tion was not promptly obtained from the Dominion Government, thus con fessing that his demaud for extraordi nary retaliation powers was a piece of buncombe. The Sackville matter is mentioned, and the correspondence in the case is promised. He has tried to prevent the exter mination of the fur seals, to fix the boundary between Alaska and British Columbia, protect American citizens of foreign birth from military service when vifaiting home, and to duly coo dole with Germaov on the death of the two Emperors. The history of the rise and fall of civil service reform, which, if written as exhaustively as other subjects dis cussed, would have used several tbous and words more, is not given in the message. The selection of Governor Beaver for Marshal of the Inauguration Day parade iu Washington assures a skill ful handling of the great number of organized bodies that will be iu line on that occasion. Governor Beaver will hriog to the work the experience of the soldier ; he is a strict disciplin arian, and so far as be is concerned there will be no delay iu the prompt movement of tbe line. It is already estimated that tbe number participat iiig will be larger by one half than ever before, and no ono could be found better equipped in all respects to man age tbe affair than Goveruor Beaver. It is probable that as a matter of per sonal fstiofdctiuu he would prefer to ride at the bead of the National Guard of tbe State, but he will doubt less accept the appointment which has ben leudered Liu), and he can take the Pennsylvania troops along for tatJ" aud escort duly. The new mili tary company of this plnce is hustling to be accepted aod mustered into ser vice in time to go to tbe inauguration with the Pennsylvania National Guard. Forest County comes to the front with a claim that it is entitled to tbe second prize banner offered by Chair man Cooper fur an incrcaso over the Blaine vote of 14, Sullivan coming first. The fact is that all the interior counties of the State did so well that it is going to be prelly difficult to dis criminate in the distribution of the burners, but Forest is entitled to one, at all events. Philadelphia Press. Tug oflic al vote in Pennsylvania, at (he lato election, as attested by the secretary of the commonwealth, was hs follows: Republican, 526,091 ; Dem ocratic, 44B.G33 ; Prohibition, 20.947 ; Labor, 3,873; American, 24. This gives lLinison a plurality of 79,438 and a majority over all of 54,614. It is safe to settle bets on these figures. But the fellow who bet that llarrisou's msjority would be larger or as large as Blaine's has won, fur Blaine's mat jority over all was 48,280, while his plurality was 81,019 Teachers' Institute. The Forest County Annual Insti tute will be held in the Court House, in Tionesta, commencing Monday, De cember 24, at 2:30 P. M., and contin uing until Friday at 12 M. Prof. A. J.

Wheeler of Wett Hick ory, will have charge of tbe music duriug the day sessions, aud will sing at each evening session. John Dewilt Miller will lecture on Monday evening; subject, ''Uses of Ugliness," and ou Tuesday evening on "Love, Courtship and Marriage." The lectures by Mr. Miller on "The Uses of Ugliness," and on "Love, Courtship and Marriage," were most heartily received by our Chautauqua audience, probably as fastidious and critical as any in the laud. Chautau qua Daily Assembly Herald. Miss Vandelia Varnum of Frauk linville, N. Y., will lecture Wednes day evening, on Scientific) Temperance. Rev. George Thomas Dowling will lecture Thursday evening, subject, "The Good Old Times." Tbe New York Sun of August 18, 1888, says of him : "He is a most elo quent man."
