duoiion of the vast military establishments I that weigh so heavily upon many peoples In j time of peace was communicated to this | Government with an earnest invitation to be represented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with a view to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result. His Majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this Government with the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of the 1'nited States to take part in the con ference. The active military forces of the I'nited States, as measured by our popula tion. t'rrltorial area, and taxable wealth, is. and under any conceivable prospective conditions must continue to bo. in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of the armed powers to whom the Tsar's ap peal is especially addressed that th? ques tion can have for us no practical Import ance save as marking an auspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modern peoples and the cultivation of p*ac? and good will among them; but In this view it behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the ben-flcent pro ject. Th** claims of owners of American sealing vessels for seizure by Russian cruisers in Rerlng Sea are being pressed to a settle ment. The equities of the cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will eventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of the proven facts.

The papers accompanying my said message make out a most meritorious claim, and justify the urgency with which it has been presented by the Government of Russia. Malietoa I-aupepa. King of Samoa, died on August 12d last. According to Article 3 of rhe general act of Berlin "his successor bhall l?e duly elect* <! according to the laws and customs of Samoa." , Arrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the general act for the return of Mataafa and the other exiled Samoan chiefs, they were brought from Jaluit by a German war vessel and landed at Apia on September ISth last. Whether the death of Malietoa and the return of his old-time rival Mataafa will a Id to the undesirable complications which the execution of the tripartite General Act has heretofore developed remains to be seen. The efforts of this government will, as heretofore, be addressed toward a harmo nious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the international engagement to which the I 'cited Slates became a party in 1S>S?.

Immediately upon the outbreak of the war with Spain the Swiss Governing nt. fulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the patron of the International Red Cross, proposed to the United States and Spain that they should severally recognize and carry into execution, as a modus vi vendi. during the continuance of hostilities, the additional articles proposed by the in ternational conference of Geneva, October 'jo. 1M?. extending the effects of the ex isting Red Cross convention of 1*^4 to the conduct of naval war. Following the exam ple set by France and Germany in 1870 in adopting such a modus vivendi, and in view of the accession of the I'nited States to these additional articles in although the exchange of ratifications thereof still remained uneffected. the Swiss proposal was promptly and cordially accepted by us, and, simultaneously, by Spain. This Government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled to testify its adherence to the broadest principles of hu manity even amidst the clash of war, and it is to be hoped that the extension of the Red Cross compact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become an ac complished fact through the general pro mulgation of the additional naval Red 4'ross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the Convention of 1NM. The important question of the ciaim of Switzerland to the perpetual cantonal al legiance of American citizens of Swiss I or?gm has not made hopeful progress to- I *ard a solution, and controversies in this regard still continue. The newly accredited envoy of the I'nited States to the Ottoman Porte carries in- ! structions looking to the disposal of mat- | ters in controversy with Turkey for a num- , ber of years.

Hit ream ol Americas Hrpubllca. I have the satisfaction of being able to state that the Bureau of the American Re puWics. created In 1400 as the organ for promoting commercial intercourse and fra ternal relations among the countries of the Western Hemisphere, has become a more efficient Instrument of the wise purposes of its founders, and is receiving the cordial support of the contributing members of the International Cnlon which art actually represented in its board of manaKement. A commercial directory, in tw,o volumes, | containing a mass of statistical matter de scriptive of the industrial and commercial interests of the various countries, has been printed in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and a monthly bulletin pub lished in these four languages and distrib uted in the l??tin-American countries as well as in the I'nited States, has proved to be a valuable medium for disseminating in formation and furthering the varied inter ests of the International Union. During the past y?tr the important work of collecting information of practical bene fit to American Industries and trade through the agoncy of the diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily ad vanced, and in order to lay such data be fore the public with the least delay the practice was begun in January. 1SIW, of is suing the commercial reports from day to day as they are received by the Depart ment of State. It is believed that for promptitude as well as fullness of informa tion the service thus supplied to our mer chants ar-d manufacturers will be found to show sensible improvement and to merit the liberal support of Congress. The experiences of the Inst year bring forcibly home to us a sense of the burdens and the waste of war. We desire. In com mon with most civilized nations, to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce. It Is true we may suffer in such cases less than other communities, but all nations are damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehen sion into which an outbreak of hostilities t rows the entire commercial world. It should be our object, therefore, to min imize. so far as practicable, this inevitable loss and disturbance. This purpose can probably best he accomplished by an inter national agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the, forces of belligerent powers. The I'nited States Government has for many years advocated this hu mane and beneficent principle, and is now in position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of selfish motives. I therefore suggest for your con sideration that the Executive be authorized to correspond with the Governments of the | principal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the ex emption of ail private property at sea, not | contraband of war, from capture or de ! struction by belligerent powers.

We exported merchandise durins the year amounting to $1.i':i,4SJ,33U, an in crease of $!8o.4>t8,771 from the preceding year.

A marked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the Treasury. Its ret po'.d holdings on November 1, 18!>s, were 885.li)"U as compared with $lKt,573,147 on No vomber 1. lsi?7, and an increase of net cas h of $207,756,100. November 1, 1897, to $31)0, 1 5. November 1, 18118. The present ratio of net Treasury gold to outstanding Gov ernment liabilities, including I'nited States notes. Treasury notes of ISiKI, silver certifi cates, currency certificates, standard sil ver dollars, and fractional silver coin, I-o vember 1, 1898, was 'J5.U5 per cent as com pared with 16.96 per cent, November 1, 1.S1 >7. I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows: That when any of the I'nited States notes are presented for redemption in gold, and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the I'nited States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the Government issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes?a non-interest-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out In any other way. they may return again, to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them?another interest-bearing debt to re deem a non-interest-bearing debt. This recommendation was made in the be lief that such provisions of law would in sure to a greater degree the .safety of the present standard, and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the gen eral business conditions of the country. In my Judgment, the present condition of the Treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago. under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be re deemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It is not to be inferred that other legisla tion relating to our currency is not re quired; on the contrary, there is an obvious demand for it. The Importance of adequate provision which will Insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now Is to that of our commercial rivals is generally recognized. The companion proposition that our do mestic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs Is a proposition scarcely leas Important. The subject. In all its parts, is commended to the wise consideration of the Congress. The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States to Cuba. Porto Rico, and the Philippines re sulting from the war, compel the prompt adoption of a maritime policy by [be United States There should be established reg ular and frequent steamship communica tion. encouraged by the United States, un der the American flag, with the newly me quired islam!?. Spain furnished to its cola nies, at an annual-cost of about two mil lions of dollars, steamship lines communi cating with a portion of the world's mar kets. as well as with trade centers ol' the home government. The United States will not undertake to do less. It is our duty to furnijh the people of Hawaii with facilities, under national control, for their export and import trade. It will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation which shall be prompt, durable, and liberal. The part which American merchant ves sels and their seamen performed in the war with Spain demonstrates that this service, furnishing both pickets and the second line of defense, is a national necessity, and should be encouraged in every constitu tional way. Details and methods for the accomplish ment of this purpose are discussed in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of Congress is respect fully invited. In my last annual message I recom mended that Congress authorize the ap pointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematic investigations with reference to the cau^e and prevention of yellow fever. This matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of the military occupation of the Island of Cuba and the commercial intercourse between this Island and the United States which we have every reason to expect. The sanitary problems connected with our new relations with the Island of Cuba and the acquisition of Porto Rico are no less important than those relating to finance, commerce, and administration. It is my earnest desire that these problems may be considered by com petent experts and that everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitary science can offer for the protec tion of the health of our soldiers in those islands and of our citizens who are ex posed to the dangers of infection from the importation of yellow fever. I therefore re new my recommendation that the authority of Congress may be given and a suitable appropriation made to provide for a com mission of experts to be appointed for the purpose indicated. 

IX'RKASE OF THE ARMY. Under the act of Congress approved April 26. 1808, authorizing the President in his discretion, "upon a declaration of war by Congress, or a declaration by Congress that war exists," I directed the increase of the Regular Army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act. There are now in the Regular Army 57, 802 officers and men. In said act it was provided "That at the end of any war in which the United States may become in volved the Army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the same arm of the service or absorption by promo tion or honorable discharge under such regulations as the Secretary of War may establish of supernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or transfer of supernumerary enlisted men; and nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent in crease of the commissioned or enlisted force of the Regular Army beyond that now pro vided by the law in force prior to the pas sage of this Act, except as to the increase of tw mty-five majors provided for in sec tion one hereof." The importance of legislation for the per manent increase of the Army is therefore manifest, and the recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose has my unqualified approval. There can be no ques tion that at this time, and probably for s me time in the futvtre, one hundred thous and nu n will be none too many to meet th,e. necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that number shall be required per manently or not. the power should be given to the President to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary; aod the further discretion should be given him to recruit for the Army within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out the entire Volunteer Army as soon as the Congress shall provide for the increase of the regu lar establishment. This will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to help the country In its emergency. Pacific Railway*. In my last annual message I stated: "The Union Pacific Railway. Main I>ine, was sold under tht decree of the United St&fcVs court for the uistrict of N- bra<*ka on the 1st and 2d of November of this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the principal of the subsidy bonds, V27.236, 512, and the accrued interest thereon, $31, 211.711.75, making the total indebtedness $58,448,223.75. The bid at the Fa e covered the first-mortgage lien and the entire mort gage ciaim of the Government, principal and interest." This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon cluded. By a decree of the court in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which would yield to the government only $2,500,000 upon its lien. The sale at the instance of the Govern ment was postponed first to Decembt r 15, 181*7, and later upon the application of the I'nited States was postponed to the 10th day of February, 1808. Having satisfied myself that the interes's of the Government required that an effort should be maue to obtain a larger sum. J directed the Secretary cf the Treasury, un der the act passed March ;{, 1887, to pay out of the Treasury to the persons entitl d to receive the same the amounts due up n all prior mortgages upon the Eastern and Middle Dlvislcng of said rallroa 1 out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise ap propriattd. Whereupon the Attorney Gen eral prepared a petition to be presented to the court offering to redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct, and praying that thereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated t ? all the rights of said prior ll-n holders and that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of the mortgaged oremi.ss t.ud maintain and operate the same until the court or Congress otherwise directed. Thereupon the reorganlzatu n committee agreed that If said petition was withdrawn and the sale allowed to proceed on the Kith of February, 1808, they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the Gov ernment the entire principal of its debt, *6,303,000. Believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficulties under which the Government would iRbor If it should become the purchaser of the road at the sale, in the absence of uny :?u thority by Congress to take charge of and operate the road I directed that npon 'he guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the Government the principal of its debt the sale should proceed. By this transaction the Government secured an ad vance of *3,803.000 over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price, and which the reorganization com mitted had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the property. It is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against the Union Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the government has received on account of its subsidy claim the sum of *04,751.223.75, an Increase of 118,997,163.76 over the sum which the reorganization committee origi nally agreed to bid for the joint property, the government receiving Its whole claim, principal and interest, on the Union Pacific, and the principal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific railroad. Steps had been taken to foreclose the gov ernments lien upon the Central Pacific Railroad Company, but before action was commenced Congress passed an act, ap proved July 7, 1896, creating a commission, consisting of the Secretary of the Treas ury, the Attorrey General and the Secre tary of the In erior and their successors !n office. with full power to settle the indebt edness tc th< government growing oat of the :ssue of bonds in aid of tile .-instruction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific bond-aided ralltatds. subject to the ap proval of the Prasident. No report has ^t-et been made to me by the commission ihus created. Whatever action is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordance with the act re ferred to will be duly submitted to the Con gress New Building for Depart meiit of Justice. I deem it my duty to . all to tile attention of Congress the lon-lition of the present building occupied by the 1) partni-nt of ?'ustice. Tile outness of that d-pan ment has .ncreased very greatly since it was es tablished ,n ;ts j,r,.sejlt in ??triers. The building now occupied try it ;s neither large enough no- of suitable : rrang< ment for the proper accommodation of th.e business of the department The supervising architect has prono:.r ced. jt unsafe and unsuiied for the use to which it is put. The Attorney General ir; his report states that the library of the department is upon the fourth floor, and that a!l the'space allotted to it is so crowded witn books as to dangerously over load the structure. The tirst floor is occu pied by thefCourt of Claims. The building is of an old and Alaoldated appearance, un suited tr the dignity which should attach to this important department. A proper^regary for the safety, comfort and convenience^ of the officers and em ployes wonid Justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in the erection of a new buiiditig of commodious proportions and handsome tinpearan-ce to.on the very advantageous site already secured for that purpose, including the ground occupied by the present srructure an i adjoining vacant lot, comprising in all a frontage of JO) feet on Pennsylvania avenue and a de|>th of 130 feet. In this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations providt 1 for the Supreme Court in the Capitol, an 1 suggest the wisdom of making provision f'>r thu erection of a separate building for the ccurt and its officers and library upon avail able ground near the Capitol. THK 

POST \ I, SEKVICE. The postal service of the country ad vances with extraordinary growth. With'n twenty years both the revenues and the ex penditures of the Post-Office Department have multiplied threefold. In the last te.? years they have nearly doubled. Our pos tal business grows much more rapidly than our population. It now involves an expen diture of $100,000,000 a year, numbers <3. 000 post-offices, and enrolls iSHi.ooo em ployes. Th?s remarkable extension of a service which is an accurate index of til-; public conditions presents gratifying ev. iier.ee of the advancement of education, of the increase of communication and bus iness activity, and of the improvement of mail facilities leading to their constantly augmenting t:se The war witlt Spain laid new and xcep tioriai labors or. the Posl-OfHce Department. The mustering of the military and naval forces of the United States required special mail arrangements for every camp and every campaign. The communication !>*? tween home and camp was naturally eag- r and expectant. In some of the larger plan s of rendezvous as many as fifty thousand letters a da , required handling. This ne cessity was met by the prompt detail and dispatch of experienced men from the es tablished force and by directing all the in strumentalities of tiie railway-mail and post-office service, so far as necessary, io tins new need. Congress passed an act em powering the Postnva.ster-Oeneral t>> . stab lish offices or branches at every military camp or station, and under this authority the postal machinery was speedily put Into effective operation. T'nder the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines they were attended and foi lowed by the postal service. Though the ajt of Congress authorized the appointment of postmasters where necessary, it was ear.y determined that the public interests would best ,be subserved. not by new desig nations, but by the detail of experienced men familiar with every branch of the service, an?l thl* policy was steadily fol lowed. Wh'fn the territory which was the theater of tvonflicl came into our possession, it became necessary to re-establish mail fa cilities for the resident population as well ili to provide tlitm for our forces of occu pation. ami the ff>ntier r'ecftilre'ment was met th rough the .extension and application o. the latter obligation. 1 gave the equi site authority and the satne general prin ciple was Applied to this as to other blanches of civil administration under mil itary occupation.

TWELFTH CE.NSLS, I earnestly urge upon Congress the im portance of early legislation providing lor the taking of the Twelfth Census. This ,s necessary in. view, of the large amount of work which must be performed in the prep aration of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration i*f ih? population. THE I'KSSION ROLLS. There were on .the pension rolls on June 30, 1 HI IS. 14 .haihes, an increase of near ly 18.000 ov?r the, number on the rolls on the same day of the preceding year The amount appropriated by the act of Decem ber lSMj! fo^ the payment of pensions for the fiscai.yvar of IX!I* was xHtuxxi Eight mililoh seventy thousand eight hun dred and seventy-two dollars and forty-six cents was appropriated by the act of March 31, M?, to cov-.r detlcienees in Army Per sians. and nts in the sum of $ij - 020.33, making a total of *14s,o?-j s-f'ja available for the payment of pensions dur ing the ftecal -rear I Kits. The amount dis bursed from that sum wan ?144 .till .870,80. leaving a balance of $.1,431,012.00 unexpend ed on the ."tilth of June, 1808. which was I covered into the Treasury. There were 38S> ramcs added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the second ses sion of the Fifty-fifth Congress, making a total of 0.4811 pensioners by Congressional enactments since 1801. The total receipts of the Patent Office during the past year were ?1.2T>3.'.MK.44. The expenditures were ?1,081,?33.70, leaving a surplus of S172.H14.65. The public land* disposed of by the Gov ernment during the year reached 8 4;i3,8Hi.?2 acres, an increase of li 14,780.26 acres over j the previou year. The total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amount ed to 92,277,0!K>. IS. an increase of $ll)0,Oti3.lM over the preceding year. Tne lands em braced in the eleven forest reservations, which were suspended by the act of June 4. 1807. again became subject to the operations of the proclamations of February 22, 1807. creating them, which added an estimated j amount of lit, 051,300 acres to the area em braced in the reserves previously created. In addition thereto two new reserves were created during the year?the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Reserve in California, em bracing 1.IH4.504 acres, and the Prescott Reserve in Arizona, embracing 10.240 acres; while the Pecos River Reserve in New Mex ico has been changed and enlarged to in clude 12(U*I0 additional acres. At the close of the year thirty forest res ervations, not including those of the Afog nac Forest and the Fish-Culture Reserve in Alaska, had been created by Executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3, 1801, embracing an estimated area of 40,71!t,474 acres. The Department of the Interior has inau gurated a forest system, made possible by the act of July, lfflts, for a graded force of officers in control of the reserves. This system has only been in full operation since August, but good results have already been secured in many s?ctions. The reports re ceived indicate that the system of patrol has rot only prevented destructive fires from g inin.r headway, but has diminished the n-.im' er of fires. The si i ial attention of the Congress is cal >cl in thai part of the report of the Sec retary of the interior in relation to the Five Civilized Tribes. It is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows: marked progress. But one outbreak of .1 serious character occurred during the year, ? nd that among the Chippewa Indians of Aiinnesota, which happily has been sup pressed. While it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the act of June 2S, 1S08, "for the protection of the people of the Indian Territory, and for other pur poses," it is having a salutary effect upon the nations composing the Five Tribes. The Dawes Commission reports that the most gratifying results and greater advance to ward the attainm.-nt of the >bjee.s of the Government have been secured in the past year than in any previous year. I can not too strongly indorse the recommendation of the Commission and of the Secretary of the Interior for the necessity of providing for tl e education of the white children -esident in tin?

Explorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the I'nited States and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products. The Forestry Division of the Department is giving special attention to the treeless regions of our country and is introducing species specially adapted to semlarid regions. Forest lires which se rious!; interfere with production, especially in irrigated regions, are being studied that losses from this cause may be avoided. The Department is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many States of the West and collating information regarding the laws of the States, the decisions of the courts, and the customs of the people in this regard, so that uniformity may be se cured. Experiment stations are becoming more effective every year. The annual ap propriation of $720,1*10 by Congress is sup plemented by $100,000 from the States. Xa tlon-wide experiments have been conducted to ascertain the suitableness as to soil and climate and States for growing sugar beets. The number of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years and the abil . ity of the I'nited States to produce its ovn sugar fiom this source has been clearly demonstrated. The Weather Bureau forecast and obser vation station.; have been extended sround the Caribbean Sea, to give eariy warning of the approach of hurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine. t'upllni Centennial. In the year 1000 will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding of the city of Washington* for the permanent Capital of the Government of the I'nited States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 1(1, 1700. In May. 1800, the archives and general oftlcs of the Federal Govern ment were removed to this place. *.>n tne 17th of November, 1800, the National Cot - gress met here for the first time, and as sumed exclusive control of the Federal District and City. This interesting evert assumes all the more significance when we recall the circumstances attending the choosing of the site, the naming of the Capital in honor of the Father of his Coun try, and the interest taken by iiim in the adoption of plans for its future develop ment on a magnificent scale. These original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and a signal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen. The people of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and government of the Capital, and of the rare instruments of science and education which here find their natural home. m A movement lately inaugurate! by the citizens to have the anniversary celebrated with fitting ceremonies, including perhaps the establishment of a handsome perma nent memorial to mark so historical an oc casion, and to give it more legal recogni tion, has met with general favor on the part of the public. I recommend to the Congress the grant ing of an appropriation for this purpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies. It might also be ad visable to authorize the President to ap point a committee from the country at large, which, acting with the Congressional and District of Columbia committees, can complete the plans for an appropriate national ceiebralion. The alien contract law is shown by ex perience to need some amendment; a meas ure providing better protection for seamen is proposed; the rightful application of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration are sug gested for consideration; and I commend these subjects to the careful attention of the Congress. The several departmental reports will be laid before you. They give in great detail the conduct of the affairs of the Govern ment during the past year and discuss many questions upon which the Congress may feel called upon to act. William Mckinley.

NATIONAL TREATIES Present Negotiations With Spain Serve as Reminder. WHEN DOGS OF 1AR GROWLED Concessions to United States Under Former Agreements. M ATTEH OF II1 S T O It Y The negotiations wtth Spain looking to a treaty of peace between the two nations have progressed with much greater dis patch than those which preceded the Span ish-American treaty of 17!V>. Before this the dogs of war of Spain, then one of the first nations, and those of the youngest and weakest, yet the most determined, growled ominously at each other, and had It not been for the cool heads and wise states manship of the fathers, this nation would have been short-lived. At the close of the revolution there was a question as to the boundaries of the states which had successfully fought long years and achieved their independence. France and Spain claimed the entire south ern border, from the Atlantic westward, and England. too, was loth to give up a number of points beyond the "ancient set tlements"?in other words, claiming that it was but a narrow strip of territory which had been made free through the arms of the Americans, assisted by the French. Spain claimed Louisiana and the French tin Florida?, and consequently Spain, assenting that her boundary started from th thirty lirst degree of latitude and the Mississippi, controlled the lower part of that river, and could effectually shut off its navigation by the western settlers along that river and the Ohio. Question of tavlaatinn. I-ong before the cloee of the century th.' importance of the free navigation of the Mississippi liecane apparent to the west- rn settlers, and to the country at large, but Spain being obdurate on this point, and continuing 10 exercise exclusive control, open warfare was with difficulty averted. Indeed, the delay in obtaining the right to navigate th.1 river was the caus ? of much unfavorable comment In the vail ys of the Ohio and Mississippi, and the settlers were Inclined to open the Mississippi by force, and the thteats mad- found their way to Congress. One letter, aft-r reciting that the goods of settlers had been confiscated at New Orleans, and the yield of the coun try Was such that all the Spanish ships could not carry It off. ass-rted that the river must b? opened, and unless Congress acted and a satisfactory treaty was niau? Which would give them an out I.' to the sea. they could raise mer> to enforce ihe demand, and closed with these words: "In 4 ase v.e are not suc cored by the United Slates, our allegiance w.ll be thrown off. Great Itrltain stands ready with open arms to rcC'ive and sup P rt us, and with Canada will U able to co.;.juer you." Tiius. in out infancy the stability of the Union was endangered by its own peopi. , a secession 01 the west and southwest b-.ir..;: threatened. FurtMnate'y. Spain found tiouble nearer home, and October "_'7. 17'ir. signed H treaty which allayed the feeling. By this she agreed thai the navigation of the Mississippi in its whole length from its source to the ocean, should be free to the subjects of Spain and the citizens of th 1'r.lted States, unless the King of Spali should extend the privilege to subjects of other jmwers. In a few years S;>:iln ce<ted I^iuislana to France, and she. holding it for three years in ceded it lo the I'nited States Thus the bone of Spain's contention was forever removed, and Spain, by the tr<aty of Feb ruary 'J2, isi'.t. ceding the Florldas? to the Union, gave us a boundary marked by the ocean's shore from t^u* Bay of Fundy to the Sabine. Treaty With Frtnpf. Our first treaty with a power beyond the seas was that with our ally and friend. France, of February H. ITT*, by which tht I'nited States agreed, should war break ou' between France and England, she would make it a common cause, and France and the I'nited States be good and faithful allies. Spain was at this time the friend and ally of France, and it was confidently hoped she would treat with us. but. as stated above, she possessed the key to the .Mississippi valley, and she was also disin clined to incur the displeasure of England. While she received some of our ministers courteously, in their private character, she was extremly cautious not lo violate tho comity of nations by giving aid and com fort to the recalcitrant children of Mother Er-l-nd. beyond proffering a small loar which could be called a private accommoda tion. Spain then possessed such rank, owning vast possessions in various parts of the world, and the products of the infant re public wer? of so vast proportions, that a commercial treaty between Spain and this country was viewed as of more importance thai a rea'v wi'h any other nation am' politically the Importance was equally great. Her influence. It was supposed, would affect both our politics and com merce. and Britain would rejoice If we were at variance with Spain. Being then the greatest consumer among the European na tions, her friendship was worth having, and strenuous efforts w?re made by our commissioners to arrive at some under standing. Spain when finally willing to nc-gotiate. Insisted on an Invariable boundary, the ex clusive navigation of the Mississippi and the possession of the Florldas. The Sea cabinet insisted that our western border extended no farther than the settlements noted in the royal prociamatlon of 17<Ei. and that it was probable Spain would capture Florida and that the lands east of the Mississippi, where settlements were prohib ited by the proclamation of were is sessions of Britain and might be objects of conquest for the Spanish crown. Thus the two nations were kept apart till after a number of other nations had treated with us. and in 17ICT the papers were signed. In the meantime Sweden. In 17X1. and Prussia. In 17f?5, had made treaties, each recognizing the principles that "free ships make free goods" and freedom of con science and of worship. In the treaty with Spain the fir?t principle was enunciated, and In the treaty of 1819 the doctrine of free ships make free gooJs; that the flag covers the property; that It shall be under stood "with respect to powers recognizing such principle; but. if eliher of the contracting parties shall be at war with a third party, and the other neutral, the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of enemies whose government acknowledges this principle, and not of others." Cession of Lonlsianu. In the treaty with France of April .to. INK, the clause in the treaty between Spain and France of October 9, lsuo. is quoted, making the King of Spain promise to. in six months, cede to the Duke of r.'rm? the province of Louisiana, and the French republic cedes the same to the United States in compliance therewith. By this the citizens were incorporated in the Union, and secured tn the free exercise of their re ligion without restriction: the vessels of France and Spain, laden with the products of their respective countries, were granted the same privileges that I'nited States ves sels er joyed for twelve years, and after ward >vith those of the most favored na tions. By the treaty of February. Spain ceded to the United States all her territory east of the Mississippi, known as East and West Florida, fixing the bound ary west of the Mississippi, the Sabine, the Red and Arkansas rivers, the use of the same to be enjoyed in common by both na. tions. The free exercise of religion and re moval to Spanish dominions without pay ment of duty was provided for. The subject of a treaty with Spain was frequently discussed under the confedera tion, and Congress being Informed bv the western settlers rwho had received a report that a commercial treaty bad been made ?with Spain without the right of free navi gation) that the Spanish had robbed them and confiscated their flour, tobacco and meal, in 17HR adopted a resolution declaring the report unfounded, and asserting that the United States had a clear right to the navigation, and parsed the subject over to a new government. Then, under the new I | government?the administration of Wash ington?the negotiations w*'Vr continue**, and. as stated. a treaty was signed iti 17WT. In justice to Spam, ?vin.\*?r, it should b said that. although she whs tardy in aid ing ua hv risnlnar a treaty. her influence In our favor was exercised on the Kmi? r >r of Morocco, and a treaty with him wa.* brought about.

The Constitution and t rent lea v -to recognised as the supreme law of the land, and It was early held by the courts that tho government has full power of acquiring '? r ritory by conquest or tr?at>. First |Vt? i>, MI!. says: "The usage of the world Is. if a nation !>?? not entirely subdued, to consider the hold ing of conquered territory as a mere n?.i? tary occupation until Its fat ? shall he ??? - tcrmlned at the treaty of peace.

On such transfer of terri tory it has never been held that the i Hons of the inhabitants with each oth. i are changed. Their relations with their former sovereign are dissolved. and i v* lations are created between them and the government which has ncqulre?l their tern tory.

A special to the New York Tribune from Havana under date of December 4 says: The straits of the Spanish authorities for money gave rise to a sensational episode this week. Captain Oeneral Castellanos went in person to the Spanish Bank of Cuba and demanded $s."?o,ooo cash. He was accompanied by sul>ordinate officials. After making the demand the captain general of fered a receipt or due bill of the govern ment. The president of the bank declared that it had not the cash to meet the de mand. The captain general directed the cash drawers to be opened by his subordi nates. This was done, but no money wm* obtained. A meeting of the directors wai then called, instead of linding means to satisfy the government thev Indorsed the refusal of the president to supply funds, and affirmed a notice previously bent to de positors asking them to withdraw th**tr de posits temporarily from the bank, because of its semi-official relation to the Spanish government. It has heretofore submitted t< ihese enforced contributions, bur th* .*x pectatlon of early American control caused the decision to be taken to advance no more funds. Though American authority was not established on December I. as had b* ? n ex pected, there Is no probability of the luuik yielding to Castellanos' demand. Other financial institutions support Its position. When th?* Spanish troops evacuated Hol guin. In Santiago province, the military commander went to the Holguin branch of the Spanish ftiank and forcibly took what cash It had and left a government due hill. This incident had given warning to th- di rectors of the parent Institution in Havana, ;,nd they had prepared for a visit from the captain general. The bank will be reorgan ised the day that Spanish sovereignty in Cuba ceases. Notwithstanding the captain general * failure to obtain funds, the dissatisfaction of the troops over their pay i* repressed and the embarkation <-ontinues without in terruption. The last of the Guardla Clvlles. or rural police force of the regular army, have gone and danger of revolt from that source Is ended.
