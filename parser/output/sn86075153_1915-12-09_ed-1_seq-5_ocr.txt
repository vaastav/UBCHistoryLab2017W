fRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE National Preparedness Main Theme of Head of Nation. Submits Definite Plärr to In crease Present Standing Force Regulars and For Four Hun dred Thousand Citizen Soldiers Raised In Increments of One Hundred and Thirty-three Thousand. F ollowing is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and bouse at the beginning of the ^•fourth congress: Gentlemen ef the Congress-Sioce I haJ the privilege o£ addressing rou on the state of the Union the war ■f nations on the ether side of the sea, h bad then only begun to disclose !. Tiortentous proportions, has extend 'd ira threatening and sinister scope rti its thn until it has swept within its flame come portion of every quarter of the clobe not excepting our own laemi gnliere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents ' prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and pépies have never been called upon to attempt before. The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares that jje hopes that when the time comes for readjustment und recuperation this country will be of infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by president Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains in be seen. Her fortunes are In her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advan tage or her in her distress and under take to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty is often a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set aDd to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among usfaccept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine is, "That government is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community;" that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community bath an indubitable, inalienable and Indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it ln such manner as shall be Judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge Itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec-' ossary process. We will aid and be ttend Mexico, but we will not coerce her, and our course with regard to her ou ?ht to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty °r selfish control.

(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.) of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But Just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. *We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine oxr enthusiasm for Individual liberty and free national development to the inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there is a people that tries to walk In these difficult paths of Independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have set America aside as a whole for the uses of Independent nhtlons and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely aa a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war. a a 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force—Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been m mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military arm of their government which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these Ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were'' conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102.985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, or 141,848 all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers. ten regiments of Infantry, four regiments of field artillery and foor aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, 792 non commissioned officers for service ln drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These Declares That if Full Navy Pro gram Is Carried Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Bor ders. âre the additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth mus and in Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi zens, raised In increments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This it Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400,000 men would be pro vided with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in association with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call.
