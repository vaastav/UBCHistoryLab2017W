EEAL FEELING AGAINST FOED - w ' as to the mission of Henry Ford's peace ship and the mission abroad of the band which he leads at his own ex pense, it is safe to presume that many of the sneers of derision that have at tended the advent ure arc prompted not so much by doubt as to the advisability of the cruise as hatred of Ford as a producer. The Detroit automobile manufactur er has shown to the world and has taught mankind that the laborer is worthy of his hire and that there comes a time when he should share in the enormous profits of his toil. Mr. Ford has put that principle into practice in his great shops and he has further demonstrated that as the demand grows and the product Increases the cost may be reduced rather than ad vanced. Men who through combine and mon opoly, fatten off the people as their needs and desires multiply do hot like the Ford style a little bit. He is a menace to the interests, for whether or not he shall prove an ingel of peace he has already proven ;an apostle of good will and of fair "dealing among men, , RICH MEN QUIT SENATE. - The complexion of the United States senate is greatly changed with the as sembling of the 64th congress. It has Tost nine conspicuous members, among them Elihu Root of New York, Theo dore E. Burton of Ohio and Isaac Ste phenson of Wisconsin, the latter the (octogenarian millionaire. J Forv many years the senate was known as the "millionaires' club." It began losing this aspect when Sena tor Aldrich of Rhode Island retired, nd the spirit of progressivism swept tnto office men who stood for ideals op posed to the system represented by th "millionaire" senators. The direct lection of United States senators plac ed the upper house of congress on a more democratic level and today the rich senator is conspicuous, whereas the man of moderate means was mark Ad 10 years sgo. .

Delaware, whose wealth was acquired In the manufac ture of powder, is among the few mil lionaire senator, who include Weeks of Massachusetts and Le Baron Colt of Rhode Island. LEWIS IS AGAIN HONOSED. Democratic members of the United States senate in caucus unanimously reelected United States Senator James 1 Hamilton Lewis of Illinois as senate i "whip."

One effect of the European war that is being felt In this country is the sudden tightening of the lines of alleg- i iance, which had been allowed to sway j rather loosely before. Aliens who passed through the process of natural- ization a few years ago were many of jthem surprised at the ease with which the change of citizenship was effected ' and, it is very probable that few of jthem were impressed with the serious- ! nrss of the step they had taken. When a man swears allegiance to a new nation, if he has come from one of the European nations where the government and its representatives are , hpld Jn high rCgarfli ne invests the act Utith deep importance. To have the representatives of the new government j ne chooses for his own dawdle through tne proceeding in a bored sort of way, the spectators smiling uncurbed at the j ridiculous kubwcib ne uiano ,u u, excitement to some questions, fills him the courts of another nation, and the imen who are naturalized before them iare undoubtedly better citizens and Judge Crouch, of the supreme court, of New York, is such a judge.

President Wilson's message to con gress, read in both houses today, is like all Ms state papers since he en tered the White house not only a classic, but it is a document of sound wisdom and understanding. Naturally war conditions in Europe consume the greater part of the presi dent's thought In reviewing the changes that have been wrought by reason of the war since last he ad dressed congress, he speaks of how this nation has stood apart from the conflict, studiously neutral, as is our manifest duty. He speaks of how well this nation has always stood the test of its international obligations, and cites Mexico as a recent instance of this. The president goes extensively into the question of preparedness, holding that war has never been a matter of men and guns, but rather a thing of disciplined might. National efficiency and security are held up as consti tuting the paramount thought of the message, which should be received in the spirit of their peculiar genius, not as partisans, but as heralds and prophets of a new age.

All the talk and writings by the Press and the so-called "Patriotic So- about our "titter helplessness, our "dangerous unpreparedness," our 'defenseless condition," our "growing weakness," our "having fallen to the third or fourth grade of inferiority in naval strength." etc., is pure tommy rot, based not on a single fact. Let it be first understood that in the "preparedness" program the navy of Great Britain is eliminated. This was so testified bv the secretary of the navy, Admiral Fletcher, and other nav al experts, and even by Hobson in the hearings before the naval committee at the last session of congress, all de claring that de do not need or desire a navy as strong as hers. Notwithstand ing the metropolitan press, magazine writers and the "Patriotic Societies and the Navy Year-Book (which was n nnyl In Vn lnct enn nTQCa ortrl will nZnnmel and misleading, the fact is, we have! built and are building, the strongest ; , . ..,.,, , thB wnrH ' of Great Britain (which is M above Btale(U 0ur navy jg stronger than that of Germanv, far superior to that of France, more than twice as strong as that of Japan or of any of the other nations.

Admiral Badger, ex commander of the Atlantic fleet (a member of the general board of the navy) declared that no one had ever heard him say that "Germany had a superior navy to ours." The facts of record, the tests laid down by naval experts here ' and abroad, and the naval authorities of the world (all of which I have before me as I write) confirm the truth of this testimony. The armored fleet of Germany, con sisting of battleships, dreadnaughts and predreadnaughts, armored cruis ers and battle-cruisers (built and building) in number is 52 (to say noth ing of the vessels lost since Jan. 1, 1015.)

It is about broken bones. Everybody who has the misfortune to have a bone fractured knows, or thinks he knows, that two things are essential parts of the surgeon's treat ment. First, the fracture must be "set." and then it must be held per fectly rigid until the ninth day, when iby some mysterious force of nature's Ithe two or more fragments suddenly seue now oi one another and com mence to "knit," or grow together. No newspaper account of an indi vidual instance of fracture is consid ered complete without the conven tional statement that "Dr. Blank was summoned and reduced the fracture." As a matter of fact Dr. Blank usual ly requires anywhere from a few days to two weeks to "get" or reduce the fracture. For instance, in a case of fractured femur (thigh bone) or frac tured hip, it is practically Impossible to bring the broken ends in contact within a week or ten days, though ev ery effort is put forth by the surgeon to do so. The only way In which such a fracture can be immediately reduced is by cutting down upon the broken bone and wiring or nailing the frag ments together. This is a procedure that is being followed more and more freqently these days. The reason a fractured femur resists "setting'' so long Is that the great muscles are in a etate of continual contraction which cannot be forcibly overconw witnout the aid of an anes- thetic, eady, gradual pull on the leg, Tavenner The Argus: generously agreed to permit me to make-j whether it Is timely or untimely; tO im-1 and the byways for wnat may uo BO i must " CI-YDE H.

We are prepared. Instead of "our navy growing weak er." as the metropolitan press, the "patriotic societies" and the jingoes and war traffickers should have the people believe, it is growing bigger, stronger, more efficient and better equipped every year.

We have nearly 100 per cent more torpedoes, mines, mine layers, powder and other muni tions than we had on the 1st day of March, 1913, and steadily, increasing them. We have under Mr. Wilson's and Mr. Daniels' administration, for the first time in years, the full complement of enlisted men authorized by law. We are preparing. In view of the foregoing facts, was not President Wilson right when he said in his message to congress De cember, 1914, in opposing the program of the Hobsons and Gardners: "Let there be no misconception.

Meanwhile the process of callous formation has gone forward from the very instant of the injury. First there is blood-clot; this slowly thickens, "organizes" as doctors say, becomes permeated by newly formed blood ves sels, which carry lime salts to the clot.

Some fractures are better treated without splints at all. The X-ray inspection of broken bones proves that this is true. Questions and Answers. Cook writes I have a chronic vari cose ulcer which has refused to heal for eight years, have tried everything under the sun, but nothing does any good; in fact most salves irritate it. Now you say all varicose ulcers can be healed. How can I get mine healed?

CHORDS AND DISCORDS Settlers. Settlers are divided into many kinds. Among those who have done a great service to mankind in the classification of settlers are Dun and Bradstreet and the Credit Men's association. Some people are proud to be called "earlv settlers," but many of the early tir. in nn niare did so because wn,KlA Uivxerc liVa that One hears now and then of an "old settlers' picnic." But if some one were foolish enough to try 10 organize a "prompt settlers' picnic," it would be a rank failure. There wouldn't be enough persons there for a quorum. The only people you can converse freely with on the subject of settling is the man you owe. The man who owes you is strangely reticent and sensitive on the subject, and will even rudely walk away if you persist in referring to those disagree able things. The average old settler, if you have the dots on him. will stick fairly close to the actual year he moved into the community. But if you haven't got him tagged, he'll stretch it at least 15 years. The inducers to colonization are al ways begging people to come there and settle. Their pleading usually gets those that the former neighborhood pleads with to stay where they are and settle.

M. C. The Daily Story James Pike of PikeviQe By Everett P. Clarke. The Pikeville gold fields wr dlscor-1 ered and, exploited by Jim Pike, who was as big a rascal as ever lived, j There was not an ounce of gold within j two miles of the place except what' Jim had put there from some other j mine, but it was enough when mixed j with a certain red ore there was on the j property he bad staked out to sell to others to convince hungry gold hunters i that he had struck it rich. j When therefore he gave out that he ; had several hundred acres and couldn't j w ork more than one acre himself every-1 body clamored to buy a small slice of his "surplus. It required a lot of per suading to induce him to sell, and every time he sold a lot he seemed to be heartbroken. "There goes a for tun'," he would say. "just because I haven't the funds to get it out o' the ground." Nevertheless Jim was always per suaded, and if the would he purchaser hadn't the cash to buy with he would just as a favor take anything he could get He sold one man who was down on his luck a lot fifty feet by fifty for a revolver. This transaction was talk ed about, and any man who bad a horse, a watch or an old fiddle would go to Jim Flke and buy a bit of ground with it But none of these investors got any gold out of their lots. First there was grumbling; then there was cursing, and at last there was a putting together of heads, and the opinion was promulgat ed that Tike had swindled the pur chasers. Those who had bought the best and largest tracts for cash con sulted as to how they conld get their money back; those who had bought with " cats and dogs were not o wrought np, but among the whole there grew up a disposition to prevent t'ika ! from getting away from the place with j the booty. j Pike had a deep insight into hnman ; nature. It was his opinion that those 1 who have been swindled once might bo j swindled again. Moreover, he believed that it is easier to swindle a comma- J nity than an Individual. "That's tha plan," he said, "on which promoters . work. If Tom is satisfied that a cer- i tain scheme is a good one Dick is ready i to follow Tom, and the two together bring in Harry. Tom, Dick and Harry i bring in the multitude." j So Mr. Pike concluded that, having by one swindle made a nucleus for ' another, he bethought himself what that other one should be. The object of his second scheme was not to taka ! any more money out of the citizens of i Pikeville, for he had got about all thera j was. What he desired was to get away with his plunder. j He gave out that in the kindness of , his heart he had taken many odds and j ends for his property for which ha ! had no use. He had decided to lump; j Sidelights on the Peking. (Correspondence of The' Associated Press.) Recent utterances of Baron Ishii, Japan's new minister of foreign affairs, concerning the un settled conditions in China and the re- 'peated statements of Japanese news- ! papers about the necessity for the preservation of peace in China have caused mucn uneasiness ana appre hension in Peking. Repeated rumors that Japan has re vived the demands made under Group V. in its ultimatum of May 7, add to the general unrest in China and af ford food for the campaign which is being waged by opponents of the mon archal movement. In a recent article the Tokia Dally Yamato, states that Baron Ishii will have a far better defined foreign pol icy than his predecessor and is ex pected to improve the foreign rela tions with Japan by some striking dip lomatic strokes. Commenting on this : the Peking Gazette says: "If strokes : more striking than those delivered by jMr. Hioki at the command of Baron Kato, and which yielded the brigand harvest of the Japanese demands are i expected, the God help the coming em j pire of China." J The demands made by Japan under 'GroUD V. all Of Which nro nnir hl,1 j in abeyance, are the dread of all Chin jese. Constant references are made to them in the newspapers printed in : Chinese as well as those printed in ; English. Under this group there are : seven articles. The first provides that jthe Chinese government shall employ , mnueniiai Japanese as advisers in po litical, imancial and military affairs. Article two empowers Japanese hospi tals, churches and schools to own land in the interior of China. Under the ; third article, Japan seeks joint admin istration with the Chinese of the po lice department in important f'Wn,t cities. The fourth articio Ktnniot that China shall buy at least fifty per j cent or Its munitions of war from Jap an and shall employ Japanese techn ical experts in an arsenal operated I jointly in China by Chinese and Jap ianese. The fifth article demands th right to construct important railways in the Yang-tse valley. Article six stip ulates that when China needs foreign capital to develop public works in the j province of Fukien, Japan shall first oe consulted. The concluding article demands that Japanese subjects shall have the right of missionary propa ganda In China. President Yuan Shi-Sal and his ad visers protested vigorously against this group, which will be remembered as the group which was kept secret for gome time, declaring that demands "were not proper subjects for (international negotiations, conflicting as they did with the sovereign rights of China, the treaty rights of other powers, and the principle of equal op portunity." ! Supporters of the republican form I of government are frank in their charge that President Yuan SW-kai Is them and raffle them. He thoait there were $1,000 worth of them, b he would call It $500. Those who had invested money j, Pikevilie lots scorned to Invest Pike's lottery. Those who had low nothing of moment, thinking that thes neighbors had bought with more uable articles than himself and that the collection would be a flue thing ts have, took shares. In this way shares were sold to the most guillbl of the population. Pike not only took the remaining 200 shares himself, bat pledged himself if he won to put th names of those holding shares in t hit and let a little child, blindfolded, draw a name. To the pprson whose name was drawn he would turn ovther. tides raffled for. This seemed so fair, so g?nwtro( that it caused quite a revulsion J Pike's favor. Those who had snetre4 at him did not do so any more for fear of exciting hostility Hsnlnst them, selves. Indeed, there were several fights between scoffers nnd sharehnld. ers in the lottery. While the shares were being mb, scribed for the articles to he rafflej were exhibited. In Pike's yard wers two horses, both blind, a cow, thre dogs and a goat. In his living room were fishing rods, musical instrument, several articles of furniture, some rogi much worn and small articles 0f every description down to a jewsharp. When the collection bad been ex. hibited long enough to give every oris a sight, though too short to enable any one to Judge of its worthlessness, it was announced that the drawing woalj take place the next evening at 7 o'clock, A little girl six years old was blind folded, a plug hat with 500 names ia it 200 being Pike's was placed be fore her, he put in her hand and drew out the name of James Pike. Mr. Pike stepped forth and said that he had understood there was soma error in the names in the hat, that they would be carefully examined and the final drawing would take place at 10 o'clock the next morning. There was a cheer at this, and the generous Mr. Pike bowed and smiled affably. The citizens of Pikeville arose tt next morning much excited. They had fed on excitement for months, and tba feast had now reached a climax. Also there was a sudden fall. The article to be raffled for were all at hand, but the ra filer had departed. The singular part of this story is that, while the shareholders might hare drawn lots for the collection of articles that had been put up, not a person made any move to do so. The lire stock scattered in search of food ni most of the other things were broken up by the children.

London. Further measures for tit control of the liquor trade are expect ed shortly in the military and indus trial centers of England and Scotland, but the most drastic order of ail is ex pected in London. The order affecting London no under consideration is practically th same as that applied to the munition communities and the dock section of Liverpool. Under its provisions the number of hours the bars remain open would be limited from noon to 2:30 p. m. and from 6:30 p. m. to 9:50 p. m., and the sale of liquors for con sumption off the premises made sub ject to severe restrictions. Women are the worst offenders, rid the new order is found necessary on their account.
