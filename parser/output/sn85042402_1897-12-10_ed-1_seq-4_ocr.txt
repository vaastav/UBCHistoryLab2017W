To the Senate and House of Representa tives: It gives me pleasure to extend greeting "to the 55th congress assembled In regular session at the seat of govern ment, .with many of whose senators and representatives I have been associated in the legislative service. The meeting oc curs under felicitous conditions, justify ing sincere congratulation and calling for our grateful acknowledgment to a be neficent providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a nation. Peace, and good will with all the nations of the earth continue unbroken. A matter of genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal ' regard and unification of all sections of our country, the Incompleteness of which has too long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. The spirit 01 patriotism is universal and Is ever increasing in fervor. The public questions which now most en gross us are lifted far above either par tisanship, prejudice or former - sectional differences. They affect every part of our common country alike and permit of no division on ancient lines. Questions of foreign policy, of revenue, the soundness of the currency, the inviolability of na tional obligations, the improvement of the public service, appeal to the individual con science of every earnest citizen, to what ever party he belongs, or in whatever sec tion of the country he may reside. The extra session of this congress which closed during July last, enacted important legislation, and, while its full effects have not been realized, what it has already ac complished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be required, and the peo ple, satisfied with its operation and re sults thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. THE CIKBESCY QIESTIOSI. Necessity of Putting; Our Finances I'pon a. Sound Basis. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of congress, the question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may seem, will appear when we recall the financial operation of the government since 1866. On the 30th day of June of that year, we had outstanding demand liabilities in the sum of 5728,858,4-17 41. On the 1st day of July, 1879, these liabilities had been reduced to $443,889,495 88. Of our interest-bearing obligations, the figures are even more striking. On July 1, 1866, 'the principal of the Interest-bearing debt of the government was $2,332,331,208. On the 1st day of July, 1893, this sum had been reduced to $585,037,100, or an aggre gate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The interest-bearing debt of the United States on tne 1st day of December, 1897, was $817, 365,620. The government, money now out standing (December 1) consists of $346, 681,016 of United States notes; $107,793,280 of treasury notes issued by authority of the act of 1890; $384,963,504 of silver certifl-' cates and $61,280,761 of standard silver dollars. . With, the great resources of the govern ment and with the time-honored example of the past before us, we should not hesi tate to enter, upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and re lieve our financial laws fiom ambiguity and doubt. The brief review of what was accom plished from the close of the war until 1893 makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our financial Abil ity or soundness; while the situation from 1893 to 1897 must admonish congress of the Immediate necessity for so legislating as to make the return of the conditions then prevailing impossible. There are many plans proposed as a remedy for the evil. Before we Can find the true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our currency of every kind is not good, for every dollar of it is good; good because the govern ment's pledge is out to keep it so, and that pledge will not be broken. How ever, the guaranty of our purpose to keep the pledge will be best shown by advanc ing toward ts fulfillment. Evil of, the Present System. The evil of the present system is found In the great cost to the government of maintaining the parity - of our different forms ol money; that, is, keeping all of them at par-with gold. We surely cannot be longer heedless of the burden this Im poses upon the people, given under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past .four years have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the gov ernment, but a dangerous menace to the national credit. It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated redemptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our demand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their re demption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the government, by solemn enact ment, has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody ' Is obliged to redeem in gold but the government. The banks are not required to redeem In gold. The gov ernment is obliged to keep equal with gold all Its outstanding currency and coin obligations, while its receipts are not re quired to be paid in gold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, and tne only means by which the government can, with certainty, ggt gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. The -government vJithout any fixed gold revenue Is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done, and which, under the au thority now given, it will continue to do. The law which requires the government. after having redeemed its notes, to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant replenishment of , the gold re serve. This is especially so in times ot business panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government. A.t such times the govern ment has no other way to supply its def icit and maintain redemption but through the Increase of Its bonded debt, as during the administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of 4 per cent bonds wre issued and sold and the proceeds used to nay the expenses of the govern ment In excess of the .revenues and sustain the gold reserve. While It is true that the greater part ot tne proceeds or inese bonds were used to supply deficient reve nues, a considerable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve. Replenishing; the Gold Reserve. With our revenues equal to our expenses, there would be no deficit requiring the is suance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,000, how will It be re plenished except by selling more bonds? Is there any other way practicablender existing law? The serious question then is, Shall we continue the policy that has been pursued in the past that is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue" more bonds and supply the needed gold or shall we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further legislation is had and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now author ized by law. I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government an quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any of the United States notes are presented for re demption in gold and areredeeemed In gold, such notes shall be kept and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers gold from thegovernment, he should not rec ive back from the government ' . a United States note without paying gold i in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the gov- I ernmtnt issues an interest-bearing debt j to provide gold for - the redemption of United States notes a nonlnteresf-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except ch demand and forgold. If they are put out iiu any. other way they may return again to be followed by an other bond Issue to redeem them" another interest-bearing debt to redeem a ndn - interest-bearing debt. . " . : In my view, it Is of the utmost Import ance that the government should be re lieved from the business of providing for all the gold required for exchange or' ex port. . This responsibility Is alone toorne by the government without any of the usual and necessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not -feel!. the strain of the gold redemption.. The. whole strain rests upon the government, and the size of the - gold reserve in the treasury has come .to be, with 'or with out reason, the signal of danger or of se curity. This ought to be stopped. - If we are to have an era of prosperity In the country with sufficient receipts for the expenses of the government, we may feel no immediate embarrassment from our present currency; but the danger still exists, and will be ever present, menacing us as long as the existing system con tinues. And, besides, it is In times of adequate revenues and business tran quillity that the government should pre pare for the. worst. We cannot avoid, without, serious consequences, the wise consideration and prompt solution of this question. : ... .., Plan of , Secretary Gage. The secretary of the treasury has out lined a plan in great let ail lor the pur pose of removing threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve and saving us from future embarrassment on that ac count. To this plan I invite your care ful consideration. J concur with the sec retary of the treasury in his recommenda tion that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of- the bonds which they deposited for circula tion, and that the tax on circulating notes, secured by the deposit of such bonds, be reduced to one-half of one per cent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will enable the smaller villages and agricul tural regions of the country 'to be sup plied with currency to meet their de mands. I - recommend tljat the issje of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of $10 and upwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress, then I would recommend that national banks be required to redeem their notes in gold. 

CUBA AND SPAIN. .'- Attitude of the ' Administration in the Present Rebellion. The most important problem with which this country is now called upon to deal, that pertaining to its foreign rel tions, concerns its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection. Problems and conditions more or less in common with those now existing have confronted this government at various times in the past. The story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest; growing discontent an effort toward the larger enjoyment of liberty and self-control; of organized re sistance to the mother country; or oppres sion and warfare and of Ineffectual set tlement to be followed by renewed re volt. For vno enduring period since the enfranchisement of the continental pos sessions of Spain in the Western contir nent has the condition of Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba not caused concern -to the United States. The . prospect from time to time that the weakness of Spain's hold upon the island and the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home government might lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth, between 1823 and 1860, various emphatic declara tions of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cuba's connection with Spain unless in the direction of independ ence or acquisition by the United States through purchase, nor has there been any change of this declared policy since upon the part of this government. The revolution which began in 1868 lasted for 10 years, despite the strenuous efforts of the successive peninsular gov ernments to suppress it. Then, as now, the government of the United States tes tified its grave concern and offered its aid to put an end to bloodshed in Cuba. The overtures made by General Grant were refused, and the war dragged on, entail ing great loss of life and treasure, and increased Injury to American interests. besides throwing enhanced burdens qf neutrality upon this government. In . 1878, peace was brought about by the truce of Zanjon, obtained by negotiations be tween the Spanish commander, Martinez de Campos, and the insurgent leaders. Civilized Code of War Disregarded. The present Insurrection broke out in February, 1895." It is not my purpose, at this time, to recall Its remarkable increase or to. characterize its tenacious resistance against the enormous forces massed against It by Spain. The revolt and the efforts to subdue it carried destruction to every quarter of the island, developing wide proportions and defying the efforts of Spain for its suppression. The civilized code of war has been disregarded, no less so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans. The existing conditions cannot but fill this government and the Ameri can people with the gravest apprehen sion. There is no desire on the part of our people to profit by the misfortunes Of Spain. We have only the desire to see the Cubans prosperous and contented, enjoying that measure of self-control which is the inalienable right of man, protected in their right to reap the bene fit of the exhaustless treasures of their country. The, offer made by my predecessor, in April, 1896, tendering the friendly offices of this government, failed, and media tion on our part was not accepted. In brief, the answer read: There is no ef fectual way to pacify Cuba, unless it be gins with the actual submission of the rebels to the mother country. Then only can Spain act in the promised direction of her own motion and after her own plans. . Concentration Is Extermination. The cruel policy of concentration was initiated February 16, 1896. The produc tive districts controlled "by the Spanish armies were depopulated and the agri cultural inhabitants were herded in and about the garrison towns, their lands laid waste and their dwellings destroyed. This policy the late cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off supplies from the insurgents. It has utterly failed as a war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It was ex termination. " Against this abuse of the rights of war I have felt constrained, on repeated oc casions, to enter the firm and earnest pro test of this government. There was much of public condemnation of the treatment of American citizens by alleged illegal ar rests and long imprisonment awaiting trial of pending protracted judicial pro cedures. I felt it my first duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of all American citizens under ar rest. Before the change of the Spanish cabinet, in October, 22 prisoners, citizens of the United States, had been given their freedom. For the relief of our own citizens suf fering because of the conflict, the aid of congress was sought in a special mes sage, and under the appropriation of April 4, 1897, effective aid has been given to American citizens in Cuba, and many of them, at their own request, have been returned to the United States. Instructions to Minister Woodford. The instructions given to our new min ister to Spain, before his departure for his post, directed him to impress upon that government the sincere wish of the United States to lend Its aid toward end ing the war in Cuba, by reaching a peace ful and lasting result, just and honor able alike to Spain and the Cuban people. These instructions recited the character and duration of the contest, the wide spread losses it entails, the burdens and restraint it imposes upon us, with con stant disturbance of national interests and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance of this state of things. It was stated that at this juncture our gov ernment was constrained to seriously in- quire if the time was not ripe when Spain, of her own volition, moved by her own in terests and every sentiment of humanity, should put a stop to this destructive war and make proposals of settlement honor able to herself and just to her Cuban colony- it- was urged that, as a neigh boring ..nation with large interests in Cuba, we could- be required to' wait only a reasonable time for the mother coun try to establish Its authority and restore -peace and order within the borders of the island ;, that we could not contemplate an Indefinite period for the accomplishment of these results. .."..,- No solution was proposed to which the slightest idea - of humiliation to Spain could attach. All that was asked or ex pected was that some safe way might be speedily provided and permanent peace restored. It so chanced that the consid-' eration of this offer,, addressed to the Spanish administration, which had de clined the tenders of my predecessor and which for more-than two years had poured' more treasure into Cuba in the fruitless, effort to suppress, the revolt, fell to. oth ers. Between the departure of General Woodford, the new envoy, and his arrival in Spain, the statesman who had shaped the policy of his country fell by the hand of an assassin, and aJHio-ugh the cabinet Of the late premier still held office and re- " ceived from our envoy the proposals he Dore, mat caDinet gave place, within a few days thereafter, to a new administra tion under the leadership of -Sagasta. .. Spain's Vrlendly Reply. '. -. The reply to our note was received on the 23d day of October. It is in the direc tion of a better understanding. It appre ciates the friendly proposals of this gov ernment. It admits that our country is deeply affected by the war in Cuba and that our desires for peace are, just. It de clares that the present Spanish govern ment Is bound by every consideration to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States, and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this eijcl, Spain has decided to put into effect the political re f oi-ms heretofore advocated bysthe pres ent premier, -without halting- for any con sideration in the path which, in its judg ment, leads to peace. .. - . - The military operations, it is salcUwilI continue, but will be humane and con ducted with all regard for private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to the utonomy of Cuba, while guarding Spanish sovereignty. This, it is claimed, will result in Investing Cuba with a distinct personality, the island to be governed by an executive and by a local council or chamber, reserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations, the army and navy and the judicial adminis trations. To accomplish this,..the present govern ment proposes to modify existing legis lation "by decree, leaving -the Spanish cortes, with the aid of ' Cuban senators and deputies, to solve the economic prob lems and properly distribute the existing debt. i . i . Give Spain a. Chance. . In the absence of a declaration of the measures that this government proposes to take in carrying out its proffer of good offices, it suggests that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms, wnile the United States, for its part, shall enforce its neutral obli gations, and cut off the assistance which, -it is asserted, the insurgents receive from this country. The supposition of an in definite prrolongation of the war is de nied. It is asserted that the Western provinces ' are already well-nigh re claimed; that the p'.anting of cane and tobacco therein has been resumed, and that by force of arms and new and ample reforms very early and complete pacifi cation is hoped for. . The immediate amelioration of existing conditions under the new administration of Cuban affairs is predicted, and there withal the disturbance and al, occasion for any change of attitude on the part of the United States. . - Discussion of the question of interna tional duties and responsibilities of the United States as Spain understands them, is presented with an apparent disposition to charge us with failure in this regard. j This charge is without any basis in fact, It could not have been made if Spain had been cognizant of the constant effort, this government has made, at the cost of mil lions and by the employment of the ad ministrative machinery at the national command, to perform its full duty accord ing to the law of nations. That it has successfully prevented the departure of a single military expedition or armed vessel from our shores in violation of our laws would seem to be a sufficient answer. But on this aspect of the Spanish note it is not necessary to speak further now. Firm in the conviction of a wholly per formed obligation, due response to '.this charge has beep made in diplomatic is sues. Throughout all. these horrors and dangers" o our own peace, this govern ment has never in any way abrogateel Its sovereign prerogative of reserving to it self "the determination of its policy and course, according to jts own highsense of right and in consonance with the dearest interests and convictions of our own peo ple, should the prolongation of the strife so demand. - . Of the untried measures there remain only: "Recognition of the Insurgents as bellig erents; recognition of the independence of CujDa; neutral Intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise be tween the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party.'' Not a Question of Annexation." . I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of.. That, by our code of morality, would be criminal" ag gression. Recognition of the' belligerency of the Cuban insurgents has often been canvassed as a possible if not inevitable step, both in regard to the previous. 10 years' struggle and during the present war. I am not unminatui tnat tne two houses of congress, in the spring of 1896, .X j.t' ' .,i,u isted requiring or justifying the recogni tion of a state of belligerency in Cuba, and during the extra session the senate voted a joint resolution of like import, -which, however, was not brought to a vote in the house. In the presence of these significant expressions of the senti ment of the legislative branch. It behooves the executive soberly to consider the con ditions under which so important" a measure must needs rest for justification.' It is to be seriously considered whether the Cuban insurrection possesses, beyond dispute, the attributes of statehood which alone can demand the recognition of bel ligerency in its favor. Possession short of the essential qualifications of sover eignty by the insurgents, and the conduct of the war by them according to the rec ognized code of war, are no less Important factors toward the determination of the problem of belligerency than are the' in- I fluences and consequences of the struggle j upon the internal policy of the recogniz- i ing nation. The utterances of President Grant in his memorable message of 1875 are signally relevant to the present situa tion in Cuba, and it may be wholesome now to recall them. At that time a serious conflict had for seven years wasted the neighboring island. During all those years an utter disregard of the laws of civilized warfare and of the just demands of humanity, which called forth expres sions of condemnation from the nations of Christendom, continued unabated. Desolation and ruin pervaded that pro ductive region, enormously affecting the commerce of all commercial nations, but that of the United States more than any other, by reason of proximity and larger trade and Intercourse. .

ANNEXATION OF" HAWAII. Ursres the Senate to Accomplish the Union By a special message dated th J6th day of June last, I laid before the senate o the United States a treaty, signed that d.ay ' by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii, hav ing for its purpose the . incorporation o the Hawaiian islands as an Integral part of the United States 'and Under its sov ereignty. The senate having removed the injunction ;;of secrecy, although the treaty is still pending before that body, the subjectr.may.be properly referred to in this message, as the necessary action of' congress Is required to determine by legislation many details of the eventual union, should the fact- of annexation- be accomplished, as I believe it should be. While consistently disavowing -from a very early period any aggressive policy of absorption in regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of discussion through three-ouarters of a centurv , has - pro claimed the vital Interest of the United States In the independent --life of the Islands and their intimate commercial de- pendency upon i his country. At the same "time It has been repeatedly, asserted that in no event could the entity of Hawaiian statehood. Cease by the passage of the is lands under the domination or Influence of another - power, than the United States Under ' these circumstances the logic of events required that annexation before offered but declined, should, in the. ripe ness of time, come about as -the natural result of strengthening the ties that bind js to those islands and be released by the free will of the Hawaiian state, That treaty was unanimously ratified .without amendment by the senate and president of the republic of Hawaii on the 10th of September' last, and only awaits 'the favorable action of the American sen ate to effect the complete absorption of the islands into the domains of the United States. " What the conditions of such a union shall be, the political relation thereof to the United States, the character of the local administration, the quality' ancT de gree of the elective franchise of the in habitants, the extension of the federal laws to the territory or the enactment of special laws to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the regulation and needs of labor therein, the treaty has wisely relegated to congress. .

Salvador and Costa Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L. Merry, confirmed as minister of the United States to the states of Nicaragua, Salvador and Costa Rica, shall proceed to San Jose, Costa Rica, and there tempo rarily establish the headquarters of the United States to those three states. 1 took this action for what I regarded as the paramount interests of this country. It was developed, upon an investigation by the secretary of state, that the government of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to re ceive Mr, Merry in his diplomatic capac ity, was unable to do so on account of the compact -concluded June 20, 1895, whereby that republic and those of Salvador and Honduras, forming what is known- as. the Greater Republic of Central America, had surrendered." to the representative diet thereof their right " to receive and send diplomatic agents. . The diet was not will ing to accept him because he was not ac credited' to that body. ' I could not ac credit him to that body because the appro priation law of congress did not permit. Mr. Baker, the present minister at Man- ' agua, has bjfcen directed to present h letters of. recall. j , Mr. Godfrey Hunter has likewise been accredited to the governments of Gaute mala and Honduras, the same as his pred- j ecessor. Guatemala is not a member of the Greater Republic of Central America, i but Honduras is. Should this latter gov ernment decline to receive him, he Has been Instructed to report this fact to his . government and await its further instruc tions. - , - . The Nicaragua Canal.' A subject of large Importance to our country and increasing appreciation on the part of the people is the completion of the great highway of trade between the At lantic and Pacific known as the Nicara gua canal. Its value to American com merce is universally admitted. The com mission appointed under date of July 24 last "to continue the surveys and exam- inations authorized by- the act approved March 2, 1885, in regard to the proper route, feasibility and cost of construe- of making complete plans for the entire work of construction of such canal," is now employed In the undertaking. In the future I shall take occasion to transmit to congress the report of this commission, making at the same time such further suggestions as may then- seem advisable. THE 

BIMETALLIC COMMISSION. - Failure of the Mission of the' Special Silver Envoys. Under the provisions of the act of con gress approved March S, 1897, for the pro motion of an international agreement re specting bimetalism, I appointed, on April 14. 1897, Hon. Edward O. WolCott, of Colorado; Hon. Adlai E. Stevenson, of Illinois, and Hon. Charles , J. Payne, tf Maaoanhiicnfta aa cnanlal aniiAva 4-n flxed ana relative value between eold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assur ance that we are not alone among the larger nations of the world in realizing the international character of the prob lem and in the desire of -reaching spme wise and practical solution of it. I xiie xiilisii government nas puousnea a resume of the steps taken jointly by the French ambassador in London and the special envoys of the United States, with whom our ambassador in London actively co-operated in the presentation of this subject to her majesty's government. This . will be laid before congress. Our special I envoys have not made their final report. as further negotiations between the rep- ' resentatives of this government and the governments of other countries are pend ing and in contemplation. They believe that the doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting the possi- . bility of maintaining the stability of the j parity between the metals and kindred questions may yet be solved by further negotiations. Meanwhile, it gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have al ready demonstrated their ability and fit ness to deal with the subject, and it is to be earnestly hoped that their labors may result in an international agreement which will bring about recognition of both gold and silver as money upon such terms and with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon a basis which shall work no injuries to i any class of citizens. NEEDS OF ALASKA. Existing Conditions Demand a Change in the Laws. The territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of congress. The .conditions now existing demand a material change in the laws relating to the territory. The great influx of popula tion during the past summer and fall and the prospect of a still larger immigra tion in the spring will not permit us to longer neglect the extension of civil au thority within the territory or postpone the establishment of a more thorough government. : A general system of public surveys has. not yet been extended to Alaska, and all entries thus far made in that district are upon special surveys. The act of congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United States con tained the reservation that it should not be construed to put In force the general land laws of the country.' ' By an act approved 'March 3, 1891, au thority was. given .for entry of lands for townsite purposes, and also for the pur chase of not exceeding 160 acres then' or thereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture.- The - pur pose of congress, ' as ythus far expressed, has been -that only such rights should apply to, the territory as should be specifically named. -It will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast, remote, and yet promising por tion of our country. Special authority was given to the pres ident by the act approved July 24, 1897, to divide that territory into two land dis tricts, and to designate the boundaries thereof, and to appoint registers and re ceivers of said land offices, and the presi dent was also authorized to appoint a surveyor-general for the entire district. Pursuant to this authority, a surveyor general and receiver have been appoint ed, with offices, at Sitka. If in the ensu ing year the .conditions justify it, the addi tional land district authorized by law will be established with an office at some point in the Yukon valley. No appropria tion, however, was made for this pur pose, and that is now necessary to be donty 4 ' The Military Post. ' .'' - I concur with the secretary of war in his suggestions as to the necessity, for a military force in the territory of Alaska for the protection of persons and prop erty. Already a sma'l force consisting of 25 men and two officers, under com mand of Lieutenant-Colonel Randall, of the Eighth infantry, has been sent to St. Michaels to establish a military post. As it is to the interest of the government to encourage the development of the coun try and its duty to follow. up its citizens there with the benefits of legal machin ery, I earnestly urge upon congress the establishment of a system of government of such flexibility as will enable it to ad just itself in the future to the needs at tendant upon a greater population. Relief for Starving Klondikers. The startling though possibly, exag gerated reports from the Yukon river country of the probable shortage of food for the large number of people who are wintering there without the means of leav ing the country, are confirmed In such measure as to justify bringing the matter to the attention of congress. Access to that country this winter can be had only by the passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps im possible task. However, should these re ports of the suffering of our fellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost should be made to carry them relief. INDIAN AFFAIRS. New Regulations for Five Civilized , . Tribes Are Imperative. For a number of years it has been ap parent that the condition of the five civil ized tribes in the Indian' territory under treaty- provisions with the United States, with theright of self-government and the exclusion of all white persons from within their borders', have undergone so complete a changeias to render the contin uance of the system thus Inaugurated practically Impossible. The total number of the five civilized tribes, as "shown by the last census, is 4o,484, and this number has not materially increased, while the white population is estimated at from 200,000 to 250,000, which, by permission of the Indian government, has settled in the territory. The present area of the Indian territory is 25,564,546 acres, much of which, is very fertile land. The United States citizens residing in the territory, most of whom have gone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities,! have made permanent homes for them-1 selves. Numerous towns have been builf, in which from 1000 to 5000 white DeODle now reside. ' THE 

CIVIL SERVICE. Room for " Further Improvement. . .. Which Will Be Made. The important branch of our govern ment known as the civil service, the prac tical improvement of which has long b;en a subject of earnest discussion, has of late -years received increased legislative and executive approval. During the past few months, the service has been placed on a stiilrfirmer basis of business meth ods and personal merit. While the right of our veteran soldiers, to reinstatement in deserving cases has been asserted, dis missals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded against, the exam inations for admittance to the service enlarged and at the same time rendered less , technical and more practical, and a ' distinct "advance has been made by giving " .utivF.c uiBuj.oadi uijuu itii cases where incompetency is charged or a de- mand is made for removal of offic'als in any of the departments - ' . i This order has been made'to give the ac cused nis rignt to be heard without in any way impairing the power of remoVal, j wnicn snouiu always De exercised In. cases of Inefficiency or incompetency-, and which is one of the safeguards of the ?ivil ser vice reform system, preventing'-stagnation and- dad wood 'and keeping ' every employe keenly alive to the fact :that se curity of tenure . depends -not-on favor, but on his " own tested and carefully watched record of service. Much, of course, still remains to ; fee accomplished before the system can be made reasonably perfect for our needs. There are places now in the classified service which ought ' to be exempted and others unclassified i may properly be included. I shall not hes- ! itate to exempt cases which I think have ; been Improperly included in the classified service or include those which, in my judg ment, will best promote the public ser vice. The system has the approval of the people and it will be my endeavor to up hold and extend it. - I am forced by the length of this mes sage to omit many Important references to affairs of the government with which congress will have to deal at the present session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all of which I invite your earnest attention. The estimates of the expenses of the government by the several departments government uy me eeveiai ueifa.j4;iiit;iii.a should have your careful scrutiny. While ;, ,., . . congress may find it an easy task to re- congress may find it an easy task to re duce the expenses of the government, it should not : encourage their increase. These expenses will, in my Judgment, ad mit of a decrease in many branches of thegovernment without injury to the pub lic service. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within, the re ceipts of the governmtnit and thus prevent a deficit.
