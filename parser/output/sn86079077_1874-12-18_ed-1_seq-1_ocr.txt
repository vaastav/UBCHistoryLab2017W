SMITH, fieask McNicou,, Clerk. july 24,18«. The President's Message. We extract from the Presidents an imal message to Congress, published last week, the following: southern affairs. Your attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs in some of the Southern States. On the 14th of September last the Governor of Louis iana called upon me, as provided by the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid in suppressing domestic violence in that State. That call was made in view of a proclamation issued on that day by D. B. Penn, claiming that he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1872, and calling upon the militia of that State to arm, assemble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated the officers of the State Government. On the next day I issued my proclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days from the date thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession of the Statehouse. Steps were taken by me to support the existing and recog nize«! State, government, but before the expiration of the five days the insur rectionary movement was practically abandoned, and the officers of the State government, with some minor excep tions, resumed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State ad ministration of Louisiana has been the only government in that State for near ly two years ; that it has been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced in as such by Congress, and more than once ex pressly recognized by me, I regarded it is my clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent its overthrow by an armed mob, under pre tense of fraad and irregularity in the election of 1872, I have heretofore called the attention of Congress to this subject, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committed at that election, and because it appears that the returns there of were never legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen ; but from the best sources of information at my command I have always believed the present State offi cers received a majority of the votes ac tually cast at that election. I repeat what I said in my special message of February 23,1873, that in the event of no action by Congress, I must continue to recognize the government heretofore re cognized by me. I regret to say that, with preparations for the late election, decided indications appeared in some lo calities in the Southern States of a de termination by acts of by violence and intimidation to deprive citizens of the freedom of the ballot because of their political opinions; bands of men masked and armed made their appearance, White Leagues and other societies were formed, large quan tities of arms and ammunition were im ported and distributed to these organiza tions, military drills with menacing demonstrations were held, and with all these murders enough were committed to spread terror among those whose political action was to be suppressed, if possible, by these intolerant jjnd crimi nal proceedi ngs. In some places colored laborers were compelled to vote accord ing to the wishes of their employers, un der threats of discharge if they voted otherwise, and there are too many in stances in which, when these threats were disregarded, they were remorseless ly executed by those who made them. I understand that the fifteenth amend ment to the Constitution was made to prevent this and like state of things, and the act of May 31,1870, with amendments, was passed to enforce its provisions, the object of both being to guarantee to all citizens the right to vote aud to pro tect them in the free enjoyment of that right. Enjoined by the Constitution " to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," and convinced by undoubted evidence that violations of said act had been committed and that a widespread and flagrant disregard of it was contem plated, the proper officers were instructed to prosecute the offenders, aud troops were stationed at convenient points to aid these officers if necessary in the per formance of their official duties. Com plaints are made of this interference by Federal authority, but if said amend ment and act do not provide for such interference under the circumstances, as above slated, then they are without meaning, force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement is worse than mockery and little better than a crime. Possibly Congress may find it due to truth and justice to ascer tain by means of a committee whether the alleged wrongs to colored citizens for political purposes &r6 real or the re ports thereof were manufactured for the occasion. Tlie whole number of troops in the States of Louisiana, Ala bama, Geoi'gia, Forida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maryland and Virginia at the time of the election were 4083. This embraces the garrisons of all the forts from the Delaware to the Gulf of Mexico. the arkansas trouble. Another trouble has arisen in Arkan sas. Article 13 of the constitution of that State (which was adopted in 1868, and upon the approval of which by Con gress the State was restored to represen tation as one of the States of the Union) provides in effect that before any amend ments proposed to this constitution shall become a part thereof, they shall be liaised by two successive assemblies and i:hen submitted to and ratified by a ma jority of the electors of the State voting thereon. On the 11th May, 1874, the Gov ernor convened an extra session of the General Assembly of the State, which on the 18th of the same month passed an act providing for a convention to frame a new constitution, pursuant to this act, and at an election held on the 30th June, 1874, the convention was approved and delegates were chosen thereto, who as sembled on the 14th of last July, and formed anew constitution, the schedule of which provided for the election of an entire new set of State officers, in a man ner contrary to the then existing election laws of the State, on the 15th of Octo ber, 1874. The constitution, as therein provided, was submitted to the people 'or their approval or rejection, and ac cording to the election returns was ap proved by a large majority of those qualified to vote thereon ; and at the same election persons were chosen to fill all the State, county and township offices. The Governor elected iu 1872 for the term of four years turned over his office to the Governor chosen under the new constitution, whereupon the Lieutenant Governor, elected in 1873, for a term of four years, claiming to act as Governor, and alleging that said proceedings, by which a new constitu tion was made, a new set of officers elected wereunconstitutional, illegal and void, and caWed upon me, as provided in section 4, article 4 of the Constitution, to •rotect the State against domestic vio ence as Congress is now investigating ; the political affairs of Arkansas, I have declined to interfere. The whole sub ject of 

EXECUTIVE INTERFERENCE with the afiairs of a State is repugnant to public opinion ; to the feeling of those who, from their official capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to humor those who must direct. Unless most clearly on the side of law, such inter ference becomes a crime with the law to support it, and is condemned without a hearing. I desire, therefore, that all ne cessity for Executive direction in local aftairs may become unnecessary and obsolute. I invite the attention, not of Congress, but of the people of the United States, to the causes and effects of these unhappy questions. Is there not a dis position on one side to magnify wrong and outrages, and the other side to be little them or justify them ? If public opinion could be directed to a correct survey of what it is, aud to rebuking wrong and aiding the popular authori ties in punishing it, a better state of feeling would be inculcated, and the sooner we would have the States free in deed to regulate their own domestic af fairs. I believe on the part of our citi zens of the Southern States, the better part of them, there is a disposition to be law abiding and to do no violence, either to individuals or to the laws existing But do they do right in ignoring tlie ex istence of violence and bloodshed in re sistance to constituted authority? I sym pathize with their prostrate condition, and would do all in my power to relieve them ; acknowledging that in some in stances they have had most trying gov ernments to live under, and oppressive ones in the way of taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefits equal to the hardships imposed. But can they proclaim themselves entirely irresponsi ble for this condition ? They cannot. Violence has been rampant in some lo calities and has either been instified or denied by those who could have pre vented it. The theory is even raisotl that there is to be no further interfer ence on the part of the General Govern ment to protect citizens. ment to protect citizens. Till-; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO RE ENFORCED WITH RIUOR. In a State where the State authorities tail to give protection, this is a great mistake. While I remain Executive, all the laws of Congress and the provisions ot the Constitution, includiug the recent amendments added thereto, will be en forced with rigor ; but with regret that they should have added one jot or tittle to the executive duties or powers. Let there be fairness in the discussion of Southern questions, the advocates of both parties giving honest, truthful re ports of occurrences condemning the wrong aud upholding the right, and soon all will be well. Under existing conditions the negro votes the Republican ticker because he knows his friends are of that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not because lie agrees with the great cry. the color line. Put the negro, as a citizen and a voter as he is, and must remain, aud soou par ties will be divided, not on the color line, but on principle. T4ten we shall have no complaint of sectional inte ference. A Pet of a Wife. "Small size "—this is the echo of most men's wishes. They want some one to pet, to fondle, to protect, they say ; and this is truth when they feel good na tured. Cynical women say they want some one they can tyrannise over, but we are not inclined to take a cynical view of the subject. Very few men willfully tyrannize over their wives and children, 'but the tyranny is there, nevertheless, and in tellectual men, such as the world ad mire, are most prone to exercise it Ihey are so wrapped in their own plans, theories and speculations they do not discover the fact that their owu house holds are famishing for the bread of love, aud fainting for the gushiu springs of sympathy. They are so ac customed to adulation abroad that the simple home affection seems tame and spiritless ; as the purest water of the deepest well is tasteless to one accus tewed to the sparkling and burning but poisonous draughts of intoxication In our zeal to vindicate the " lords of creation" from the charge of wilful tyranny we are leaving our two bache lors and their imaginary wives too Ion neglected, Small size is a man's fancy, not the physiological knowledge. It is an al most universal fancy. The larger, the rougher, more burly the man, the more sure he is to prefer a small-sized woman. " I am determined to have a wife whom I can pick up iu my arms and carry her over all the rough places," said a voung farmer, whose softest tones sounded like a clap of thunder. As he spoke lie snatched the largest and heaviest girl in all his acquaintance, and lifted her over the brook. His words are echoed iu the selection made by most large sized and stentorian-voiced men. Their ideal is of something the reverse of them selves, and thus fragile figures and low tones are to. them the perfection of feminine attraction. Our solution of the problem lies in the supposition that it is an uneducated action of philopro genitiveness, shows in the desire for some small creature to pet, to fondle, to caress. Those who have watched the world for fifty years know how often is enacted the sad tragedy which may be named, The Bride of a Year. Mystery of the Lakes .—Lake Erie is only 00 or 70 feet deep; but Lake Ontario, which is 592 feet deep, is 230 feet below the tide level of the ocean, or as low as most parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence s and the bottoms of Lakes Huron, Michigan and Superior, although the surface is not much higher, arc all, from their vast depths, ou a level with the bottom of Ontario. Now, as the dis charge through;the River Detroit, after allowing for the probable portion carried off by evaporation, does not appear by any means equal to the quantity of water which the three upper lakes receive, it has been conjectured that a subterra nean, l'iver may run from Lake Superior, by the Huron, to Lake Ontario. This conjecture is not improbable, and ac counts for the singular fact that salmon and herring are caught in all the lakes communicating with the St. Lawrence, but no others, As the falls of Niagara must have always existed, it would puz zle the naturalist to say how these fish got into the upper lakes without some subterranean river ; moreover, any peri odical obstruction of the river would furnish a not improbable solution of the mysterious flux and reflux of the lakes. A Council Bluffs lawyer ate peanuts in Court and was fined $10 lorcontempt. The Judge remarked that he was de termined to uphold the majesty of the law if it killed tho entire peanut crop of the South. If a man really wants to find out what's in him let him go te sea. The first rougli weather will generally ena abîe Idui to ascertain, it. Size of Countries. Greece is about the size of Ver mont. Palestine isone fourth the size of New York. Hindoostau is more than a hundred times as large as Palestine. 1 he great desert of Africa has nearlv the present dimensions of the United States. The Red Sea would reach from Wash ington to Colorado, and it is three times as^ large as Lake Ontario. The English Channel is nearly as large as Lake Superior. The Mediterauean, if placed across A ort Ii America, would make sea naviga tion from San Diego to Baltimore. 1 he Caspian Sea would stretch from Aew York to Rotester. Great Britain is two-thirds the size of Japan, one twelfth the size of China, and one twenty-fifth the size of the Uni ted States. Great Britain and Ireland arc about as large as New Mexico but not as large as Iowa and Nebraska. They are less than New \ork, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Madagascar is as large as New Hamp shire, Massachusetts, Vermont, Con necticut, îsew York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, \ îrginia, North Corolina, all put together. • Gnl l t f , M(,xico is about ten times the size ot Lake Superior, and about as large as t he Sea of Kainschatka, Bay of Bengal, China Sea, Okoska or Japan Sea. Lake Ontario would go in either of them fifty tunes. The ti fty following bodies of water are near y ot equal size: German Ocean, Black, Sea, \ellow Sea. Hudson Bay is rather arger the Baltic, Adriatic, 1 ersian Gulf and Euxine Sea, about half as large, and somewhat larger than Lake Superior. P lain D iet .

Ç x. RE , ? p Horses .—All horses must not teed in the same proportions, with out regard to their ages, their constitu tions and their work. The impropriety ot such a practice is self-evident; yet it is constantly done, and is the basis of disease of every kind. Never use bad hay on account of its cheapness, because there is no proner nourishment in it. Damaged corn is exceedingly iui urious, because it brings on inflammation of the bowels and skin diseases. Chaff is better for old horses than had, because they cau chew and digest it better. Mix chaff, corn or beans, and do not give the latter alone, because it makes v! 1 ? J orse chew his food more aud digest it better. Ä Hay or grass alone will not support a horse under hard work, because there is not sufficient nutritive body in either When a horse !s worked hard its food shouhl be chiefly oats-if not worked jiaid its food should be chiefly hay because oats supply more nourishment and flesh-making material than any other kind of food ; hay not so much. ' Weights of Boys and Girls .—Upon tlie average, boys at birth weigh a little more and girls a little less than seven pounds. For the first twelve vears the two sexescontinue nearly equal in weight but beyond that age the boys acquire a decided preponderance. Young men of twenty average one hundred and thirty five pounds, while the young women of twenty average one hundred and ten pounds each. Men reach their heaviest weight at about forty years of age, when their average weight will be about one hundred and forty pounds, but women slowly increase in weight until fifty years ot age, when their average weight will be one hundred an thirty.
