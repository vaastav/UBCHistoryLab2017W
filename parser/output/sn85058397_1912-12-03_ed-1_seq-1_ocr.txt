Turks that the peaco negotiations take place in London, H London, Dec 3. Adrianople was the M point which delayed the parleys bc- H tween tho plenipotentiaries of Tur- H key and the Balkan allies when they H first opened at Baghtche and Adrian- 6 opie appeared again'at the end of the J5J: negotiations as to the most serious fi hindrance to the attainment of an rmv agreement '! At the first session the Turks ab- 'iiV solulely refused to surrender Adrian- frS Ple- DUt when tho Bulgarians finally vTEfi yielded to them on this point the la Greek delegates shrank back and de- ffi ' manded time in which to submit the MA question to tho government at Ath- 2S ens. S ; Tho reason for the Greoks' objec- l tlon is not far to seol;, according to . diplomats here. It is pointed out as obvious that the Bulgarians sacrifice J2 the" ultimate possession of Adrlano- Hf plo in the Interests of general peaco, Hi but they will expect their allies to Bp fahare their sacrifice and the only way L. in which thin can bo done Is to give IjBr Bulgaria compensation -Jn the shape iMf of terr'tor.v conquered by the Greeks, gj Serians and iMonlcncgrins, and which tmS ' they staked out for themselves. Hence jd the wall from Athens that any conces- S" slons to Turkey will "endanger the fruits of victory gained by the allies above all those of Greece and Ser- L via" ' Greece apparently fears that in case Turkey ultimately retains her north ern fortresa, Bulgaria will more ac tively dispute the Hellenic claims to the possession of Salonlki. The Ann and unchangeable attitude of Turkey on the subject of Adrian ople throughout tho negotiations Is I shown in a telegram from the sul tan to King Ferdinand to the effect that while he Is prompted by the most peaceful motives, he Is unable to renounce Turkey's hold on Adriau f opie, which all Ottomans consider us fl I a sacred Mohammedan sanctuary. It J Diplomats In all the European coun- I tries are anxious to see tho real peaco I negotiations begun, as they consider I there will then be a better chance of fl i reaching a settlement of the Austro 2 Servian dispute, which is still wor- jj rying the nerves of Europe.

Chinese gamblers resorted to desperate strat egy last night to escape the police and lured two officers to Imprisonment in gas filled chambers, leaving them to asphyxiate. The fact that each ofllcer carried a small ax saved them, as they succeeded In chopping holes through the wall to obtain air and aid. Corporal Gotf, the flrBt victim, was walking alone when an unknown Chi nese brushod by him and whispered "Plgow in Siberia club." Without waiting to call his squad, Goff rushed to the club, which was lighted up as usual. He thrust aside the doorkeeper. As tho door swung back he heard doore clicking and si multaneously tho gas lights went out. Trying the othor door ho found him self Imprisoned in a narrow hallway, seven feel long, and almost Immedi ately became aware that gas was rushing from tho open Jots.

Tbo senate was prepared today for the opening of the ninth trial by impeachment of a public officer sworn to uphold the constitution and laws of tho United States. Robert W. Archbald, a Judgo of the commcrco court, was summoned to face the demands of the house of rep resentatives that he be "Impeached for misbehavior and for high crimes and misdemeanors." The house will ho represented in the hearings by seven membors, who act as the prosecutors In the trial. They are Representatives Clayton of Alabama.

Scores of Witnesses. Tho managers appointed by the house to pro3ecuto the case before the senate asked for an Immediate trial last August, but the senate de clined to hasten Its consideration of tho case During the last week Bcores of subpoenaes were issued for wit nesses who will be brought before the senate by the house managers and by Judge Archbald's attorneys In con nection with the trial House Demands Impeachment. Aftor the house committee on ju diciary had concluded its hearings last spring it recommended that Judge Archbald bo called before the senate under Impeachment proceedings. The last time the house had exercised Its impeachment proceedings powers was in 1904 when Judge Swane, Uni ted States judgo for tho northern dis trict of Florida, wag called to account for misconduct and was acquitted by the senate The house of representa tives on July 11, 1912, adopted arti cles of Impeachment by a vole of 222 to 1 and a committee headed by Representative Clayton of Alabama, was chosen to act as the managers on the part of the house to try the case before the senate. The house managers? urged the senate to grant an immediate trial, but that body de clined to hear the case before the end of the last session.

They declared that no at tempt was made to get the property for less than Its fair value. Prominent Charge Made.

DETECTIVES President of Iron Work ers Claims Office Was Looted by Officers. Indianapolis, Ind , Dec 3. Frank M. Ryan, president of the Iron workers' union, testified at tho alleged "dyna mite conspiracy" trial today that his office was "robbed" by detectives when J. J. McNamara, the secretary, was arrested in April of 1911. Ryan, asserting he" had no suspi cion that McNamara had stored ex plosives at tho union headquarters, said he protested when officials of the National Erectors' association Joined detectives In searching the files. While he was endeavoring to furnish the combination of the safe, he said, a cracksman proceeded to drill tho lock Meantime McNamara was being hurried to California, During the search of the premises, said Ryan, he sent for his attorney, and compelled the authorities to pro duce search warrants Eighty-two quarts of nltro-glyceriu are alleged to have been found in tho vault Ryan also denied as had been charged, that as early as 190C W T. Jerome, then district attorney In New York, had "given warning that ex plosions were being done by the Iron workers." Cross-examined, Ryan was naked what ho meant by writing from New York to union headquarters: "I will not have a report this month. Nearly all my work cannot be referred to." The government charges that, as head or the union, Ryan from New York was directing union officials In other cities about Jobs to be blown up. "I moant by that I was trying to settle disputes among tho iron work ers in Now York," answered Ryan, "and I did not think it wise for mem bers in other cities to know theru was so much dissension in the ranks." Ryan added ho gavo little atten tion to tho 51.000 a month used by McNamara and for which no account- ; Ing was required. 

MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Taft Appeals for Uplift of Foreign Policies Warns Europe. Washington, Dec. 3. President Taft's first message to tho last ses sion of congress In hlB term was re ceived with close atteution or both branches when legislative business belgmi today. Dealing entirely with rcrelgn relations and America's com mercial progress In foreign trade, the rafissago paved the way for others the chief executive will sond later dealing with tho big questions of legislation zCnd government Washington, Dec 3, A note of warning to European powers, which by indirect means continue to dis criminate against Amorican trade: a strong appeal to tho congresB to up lift the great foreign policies of America above mere questions of par tisanship; a triumphant vindication of the diplomacy of the administration which is characterized as that of "dol lars versus bullets," a masterful pride in the enormous expansion of Ameri can trade an a result of the foreign policies of his administration, and an earnest appeal for Joint action by congress and the oxecutlve to open new markets for American industries these arc the more striking fcaturos of President Taft's fourth annual mes sage sent to congress today. First of Series. The message is the first of a sc ries of such communications which he will make to congress in the early days of the session, and deals entire ly with tho foreign relations of tho United States. Beginning with tho usual reference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the President adds that these have been strengthened by "a greater Insistence upon Justice to American citizens, or interests, wher ever it may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need or mu tuality in commercial and other rela tions." U. S. Most Favored Nation. For the first time In its history, says the President, tho state depart ment has obtained substantially the most favored nation treatment from all of the countries of the world. Therefore, he says, it is only natural that competitive countries should view with' some concern tho expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning, "If In some Instances the measures taken by them to meet It arc not en tirely equitable, a remedy should be found." Recommends Knox Bill. To this end the President recom mends strongly the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the gov ernment, Instead of Imposing the full maximum rates of duty against dis criminating countries to apply a grad uated scale of duties up to that max imum of 25 per cent Flat Tariffs Out of Date. "Flat tariffs are out of dato," says tho President "Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations Irrespective of tho treat ment from them received. It is very necessary that tho American govern ment should be equipped with weap ons of negotiation and adapted to modern conditions." State Department Modernized. Tho state department, "an archaic and Inadequate machine" at tbo be ginning of this administration, tho President says, has become a now organization, with highly specialized bureaus and experts deallns with ev ery phase of American trade and di plomacy Holding that the essence of this reorganized servico Is found in the merit system, which Prosident Cleveland is credited with having In troduced, President Taft makes a strong appeal to congress to make this machine permanent by giving the force of statutory law to the execu tive orders governing admission to and promotion in tho diplomatic and consular services. Appointments Nonpartisan. To show that these appointments are already largoly nonpartisan, the President points to the fact that throe of tho present ambassadors are hold overs: that of the ten he has appoint ed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister, that of tho thirty ministers appointed, eleven were pro motions; and that in the consular ser vice no less than 55 per cent of the consuls appointed by him were from the southern states. Dollars for Bullets. '"The diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern ideas or commercial inter course," says President Taft. "This policy has been characterized as sub stituting dollars for bullets. It is ono that appeals alike to Idealistic human itarian sentiments, to tho dictates of sound policy and strategy, and to Io gklmato commercial aims." The President adds that "bocause modern diplomacy is commercial there has been a disposition in somo quar ters to attribute to It none but mate rialistic aims." "How strikingly erroneous Is such an Impression may be seen from a study of tho results by which the di plomacy of tho United States can be Judged," says tho President Arbitration Treaties. Ho mentions tho arbitration treaties with France and Great Britain, which failed of confirmation in the senate; tho successful tripartite mediation of the Argentine Republic, Brazil and the United States between Peru and Ecua dor; the arbitration of the Panama Coata Rica boundary dispute; the in tervention between Haiti and tho Dominican Republic on the verge of war, the suppression of the Nicara guan war. tho halting of Internecine strife In Honduras, tho adjustment of the celebrated Taona-Afrlcan dispute i between Peru and Chile, and the ad- H justment of the Pcruvian-EIcuadoreau i. H boundary Issue. 1H U. S. Active In Diplomacy. H In consequence of these things, says (H the President, there has been a gen- ). H cral easing of International tension H on tho west coaBt of South America H He also adds that the diplomacy of ( H tho United States Is active In seek- ' H ing to assuage the remaining 111 feel- H Ing between this country and Colom- H bia. ; Taking up some of tho details of tho I year's diplomatic work, the Prosident M refers with expressions of pride to fH China, where "tho policy of encour- H aging financial Investment to enablo H that country to help Itself has had jH the rosult of giving new life and prac- H tical application to the open poor H policy. --H The consistent purpose has been to H encourage the use of American capl- tal In China, says the President, to H promote tho reforms to which that , H country Is pledged by treaty with the f H United States and other powers. There ; H has been a vigorous assertion, alBO, H he says, of tho equal right of tho IH United States to a voice In all quea- H tlons pertaining to Chinese loans and H developments. M Makes Direct Charge. H President Taft makes the direct chargo that the terrible evonts re- H corded In Nicaragua recently, tbo use- H less loss of life, the devastation of H property, tho bombardment of the H principal cities, tbo killings and the H tortures and suffering "'might have H been averted had the department of H stato, through approval of the loan H convention of the senate, been permit- ted to carry out its now well devel- oped policy." M "In Central America the aim has 'H been to help Buch countries as Nlcara- gua and Honduras to help them- reives," says the President H Monroe Doctrine Vital. M While they are tho Immediate ben- ellciaries, tho profit to the United Statos Is two-fold, he adds. The Mon- H roe doctrine is more vital in the IH neighborhood or tho Panama canal H and such countries should be reliev- H ed or the Jeopardy or heavy foreign M debts likely to provoke international H complications. The financial rehabilitation of these H countries by Amorican bankers and IH tho protection of their customs house3 H from boing tho proy or would-bo die- H tators, says the President,, would re- H move the menace or foreign creditors - and revolutionary disorder Further- b more the United States would profit j largely In a business way through the development of tho great natural re- t sources of Central America. H Commends New Neutrality Laws. H Commending tho successful results 'H of tho application or tho new neutral- H Ity laws to Moxlco and othor trou- H bled countries, tho President suggests H that means be found in addition to IH prevent the professional revolution- IH Ists from making American ports IH "foci" for revolutionary intrlguo. He H H reiterates his determination to adhere H in tho case of Mexico to tho "patient H policy of non-interference, stoadfaat H recognition of constituted authority : H and the exertion of every effort to H protect American interests." H Exports Over the Billions. H Other paragraphs of the message IH point to tho increase of American do- IH mestic exports by 200,000,000 during the past year, making the greatest H total over known, $2,200,000,000; to the IH agricultural credit system, which he H thorouhgly indorsed, to the probable . H necessity of an amendment to tho IH tur seal act to permit limiting kill- -M ing or seals; to a meeting or tho ar- IH bitrators In Washington noxt year to H adjust tho pecuniary claims between H Great Britain and America, to nego- H tlations with Mexico for tho distribu- H tion of the waters of the Colorado H river In the Imperial valloy section, H and to the financial rehabilitation H of Liberia. H Thoro Is merely historical reference H to the Chincso revolution; to tho San H Domlngan troubles, the rebellion In H Cuba and tho Balkan war develop- H monta, In which it is said the United States Is not Involved. Appeal for Co-operation. t Tho message concludes with an earnest appeal to congress to co-op- erate with the executive in its effortB to apply the old principles of diplo- f macy which have governed the coun try, tho momentous new situations of j today, when America finds itself at tho threshold of her middle ago as n nation, "too maturo to continue In Its foreign relations those tempo rary expedients natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern." 00
