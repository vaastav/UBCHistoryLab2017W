8 TREASURY REPORT. [Continued from the Fifth Page.] cost of a suitable site, I have declined to proceed further without additional authority from Congress, it being clear that it is impossible to* procure land and erect a building for the sum specified in the act. Similar circumstances have prevented the purchase of land for a public building at Cincinnati. MORE ROOM WANTED. The increase of books and papers not in daily or frequent use is so great as to interfere with the busi ness of the Department, The annual accumulation requires 7,CSS cubic feet of space for storage. All the available rooms in Hie building, including some that might be used for clerks’ desks, and portions of the public halls, have been given up for the deposit or such books and papers, and the time has come when other provision should be made. I therefore recom mend the erection of a fire-proof building upon the public grounds south of tin; Treasury sufficient for storage and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The relief which these changes would afford is essen tial for the proper transaction cf the business of tho Treasury Department. COAST StTRVET. The operations of the Coast Survey, as well as those of the Light House Board, appe*ar to have been economically and efficiently managed. THE REVENUE MARINE consists of 27 steam and 6 sailing vessels, carrying 45 guns, and manned by 188 officers and BGO men. This service has constantly improved in efficiency and in the economy of its management since the summer of 18G9. At that time a Commission was appointed for the general and professional examination of all the officers employed, and upon their report 39 were discharged, and those who were approved were assigned to duty, and given rank according to their merits. From that timo to the present Vacancies in the service have been filled after an examination, and by those found to be best qualified. At the same time, a Commission was appointed for the entire revision of the service. Their report was submitted to Congress on the 16th of May, 1870. (Ex, Doc. 93, Forty-first Congress, second session.) The vessels then employed were rated at 9,203 tons. A reduction has already been effected of 657 tons. The vessels now building, and authorized, will work a further reduction of X,232 tons, making an aggregate reduc tion of 1,889 tons. The cost of maintaining the revenue marine has been reduced from $1,293,661.67, ia 1868, to $930,249.81 for the year ending June 30,1872. A statistical table, prepared from the returns, shows tho essential par ticulars of assistance rendered to vessels, seizures made, number of vessels .examined, and number of lives saved upon the ocean and lakes. The work per formed during the last fiscal year is nearly twice as great as the average of the ten preceding years. Under existing laws, the officers and seamen of the Hevenue Marine are entitled to a pension only when they have been wounded or disabled in the line of duty, and whilst co-operating with tho navy during the war, and then at the rate, established by the act of 1814. When it is considered that this service is constant, and that, from the Ist tf November to the Ist of April in each year, tho vessels are required to cruise along the coasts, and as near the land as possible, within their respective districts, and not to make a port, except for supplies or under the pressure of positive necessity, it is clear that their services are not less hazardous than those in which the naw is engaged in time of peace. I therefore recommend that the Navy Pension laws be made applicable to the officers and seamen of the Revenue Marine. The number of the commissioned offiexs is limited by law, and each year adds to those who are disqualified by sickness, or unfitted by ago for active duty. The hardship resulting from the dismissal of officers under such circumstances is so great that I have declined to exercise a power, which may, perhaps, in contempla tion of law, be a duty, but in view of the fact that their compensation is small, and the nature of service such as to bring disease and the infirmities of age upon them prematurely, I think it a plain duty for the Government to provide a retired list, so that the active service may be supplied constantly with able and efficient men. tITE 

BOATS, ETC. From the appropriation of $200,000, made April 20, 1871, for more effectually securing life and property an the coasts of New Jersey and Long Island, seven of the old life-saving stations have been repaired and enlarged, and sixty-one new ones have been built, and new apparatus, sufficient for ordinary use, has been procured for the larger number of them. A station house has been erected and famished at Nar raganset Pier from the appropriation of $50,000 for the establishment of life-saving stations on the eoast of Cape Cod and Black Island, B, L Nine houses have been erected, on Cape Cod, and one at Black Island, and they \rili be supplied with apparatus, and •ready for use by the Ist of January next. An appro priation is required for the support of the keepers and crews. The Black Island station, and the station at Narragansett Pier, should be annexed to the Long Island district. Twenty-two vessels have been wrecked on the coasts of Long Island and New Jersey since July 1,1871, valued, with their cargoes, at over $500,000, on which the loss was about $200,00 p. The officers and crews numbered three hundred and six persons, all of whom were saved, and mainly, it is believed, through the agency of the life-saving stations, I respectfully recommend the extension of the system to the coast in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. From the report of the Supervising Surgeon of the MATUXE HOSPITALS It appears that branch of the public service is in a satisfactory condition. During the last fiscal year 13,156 patients were treated in the several hospitals of the country, at an average cost of about 97 cents each per day, or s total expenditure of $396,263.11, against a total expenditure of the preceding year of $453,082.42, or an average cost per patien of $1.04 per day. The increased receipt md diminished expenses for the last fiscal year,. as compared with the year next preceding, show a net gain to the Government of $56,8X9.21. During the same period the number of districts in which relief was furnished was greater than ever before, and the sala ries of medical officers at several of the principal ports were increased. The financial improvement shown is due largely to a more careful scrutiny of the appli cants for relief, to the rejection of those who were not entitled under the law, and also to the greater vigilance in collecting the hospital dues. - The law limits the charges for relief to seamen belonging to foreign vessels to seventy-five cents a day, while the actual cost Is nearly one dollar. Authority should be given to the Secretary of the Treasury to fix the charge within certain limits, according to the expenses in curred at the hospital and where relief is furnished. I renew the recommendation heretofore made for the erection of pavillion hospitals at New York, San Francisco, and Pittsburgh. The increase of railway and general business in the vicinity of the hospital at Pittsburgh has rendered it unfit for further use. The supervising surgeon recommends the erection in fu ture of pavillion hospitals of wood, with the under standing that after ten or fifteen years’ use they ore to be destroyed and new ones built in their stead. This recommendation appears to be wise, being at once economical for the Government and advantageous to the patients. STEAMBOAT INSPECTION. The act of Feb. 28,1871, to provide for the better se curity of life on board of vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam, has not been in operation a sufficient time to test its value in all respects, but the result, in he Tnnin, is satisfactory. The Supervising Inspector general, in his annual report, recommends several al terations in the law, not affecting its character liter ally. A bill will be prepared, providing for such alter ations as, upon further consideration, shall seem expe dient. CONSOLIDATING THE NAVIGATION AND CUSTOM LAWS. On the 16th day of May, 1872,1 transmitted to Con gress a bill entitled “ a bill to amend and consolidate the Navigation and Custom Collection laws of the United States,” together with a communication explain ing the character and purpose of the measure (Ex. Doc. 290,42 d Congress, second session), 1 respectfully ask the attention of Congress to the bill and reasons for it. The attention of the public is turned naturally to the future financial policy, which must rest upon the past and the present. The war caused three great changes in business and financial affairs that have re ceived the careful consideration of the American people. First. The country was compelled to impose heavy custom duties on merchandise. Thus, and without general observation, and without argument upon the principles involved, the nation entered upon a broad system of protection. Second. The Government issued Treasury notes for general circulation as currency, and prohibited banks of issue by State authority. Third. A system of National Banks was established, and their circulation protected by the national credit. The wisdom of the measures, speaking generally, has been established, and, subject to such changes as the changing condition and opinions of the country and people may demand, they will remain a part of our public policy until the financial consequences of the war disappear. The weight of the National debt has been so great that for more than ten years there has been no opportunity for the practical discussion of the doctrines of protection and free trade, and in that long period of an unchanged PROTECTIVE POLICE, incident to the 'burdens of the war, the nation has ad* vaneed rapidly and safely in the development of its national resources. Anticipating a continuance of peace, we may also anticipate a general reduction in the percentage of Customs duties. This reduction, however, should not be measured solely by the wants of the Treasury, but regard should be had also to the condition of the various branches of industry in which the people are engaged, in the presence of the fact that the leading pursuits of the country are stronger than ever before in the possession of adequate capital and a supply of intelligent laborers, there may be a moderate reduction, from time to time, in the rate of duties, as the diminishing expenses of the Government shall permit, without either alarming capital or injuring labor. For the purposes of Govern* xnent, the principles of political economy are national, and not cosmopolitan. A nation that can produce a given article at less cost than it can be produced else where, may wisely accept free trade in it. Bui a nation having national advantages for its production, yet des titute of shill in the incipient art or trade, must wait for the opportunity that sometimes comes from the calamity of war, or secure a more economical and a more constant support in the policy of its Government. If average natural facilities exist, the period of neces sary protection is as a short time compared with the lifetime of a nation, while the advantages gained can never be wholly lost. But if reasonable natural facili ties do not exist, then a system of duties for protection is a present and future burden without adequate com pensation. So varied and rich, however, are the nat ural resources of the United States, that we either arc, or may soon, be in successful competition with the older and more experienced countries of the world in the production of the chief articles of personal ne cessity, comfort and luxury of the machinery by which those articles arc produced or obtained. Herein is a sufficient justification for the existing protective sys tem, and for its continuance during the trtmsition period. Nor is the prospect of ultimate successful competition with other countries disturbed by the circumstance that wages of labor are higher in this country than in those of Europe. Tears since it was the thought of many that the only way to a successful contest with Europe was in the reduction of the standard of wages. That thought has disap peared, probably, in presence of fact that higher weges on thi« side of the Atlantic have stimulated emi gration, until there is a near approach to equality in the cost of labor, and of the coexisting fact that the addition thus made to the num ber of laborers bas only aided in the development of onr resources without yielding in any quarter an excess of produc£s r or retarding in any de gree the prosperity of the laboring population/ This prosperity on their part is associated with a higher and constantly Improving intellectual aud social culture and condition. It being given that an intelligent per son has all the special knowledge of an art or trade possessed by the most experienced and best trained operative* who, outside of this special training and ex perience. ia unintelligent* and machinery being given also, the intelligent person proceeds to improve and simplify the methods of production to such an extent that tm addition to his wages, even 100 per cent, represents but a small part of the advan tage gained. Yet the special training and knowledge of the ignorant man is the basis of the improvements made. This truth considered, first, with reference to a single American laborer, ana then multiplied a hun dred thousand times, represents the advantage of America over Europe and Asia, in their contest for na tional, peaceful supremacy in the affairs of the world. Thusia America solvin'g the industrial problem of the ages, by extracting cheap production from expensive labor. The reason for these remarks may bo found in the opinion I entertain, that the tariff system of the country has contributed largely to the general pros perity, aud that such general and continued prosperity ia the only basis on which even a Arise financial policy can rest. 

CURRENCY. In discussing the other changes caused by the war issues of tb« United States notes and of notes by tho National Banks, they should be considered together. Indeed* they are necessary parts of gut financial system. Neither can be substituted for the oluerwithout general disturbance nor for the State bank system, nor to any system of private banks, while Hie substitution of an equal amount of* United States notes as currency would be the cause of serious evils and losses. First, the Nation al Banks hold nearlys4oo,ooo,ooo of United States bonds, which otherwise would be thrown upon the market, absorbing domestic capital, or if purchased abroad, adding by the amount of intercut to tho annually in creasing balances against us io our account current with other countries. Second, one oflice of a bank is to aggregate the capi tal of small possessions, and thereby to furnish means in aid of important commercial and financial under takings, not only at the centres but in tho remote and newly-settled parts of the country/ Third, The National Banks are used as aids to the Government, which otherwise would require a large increase In the number of tho designated depositories, and a proportional increase of the public expanses, without the least appreciable advantage. Fourth. They facilitate exchange between soctionanf tho country, and thus diminish the cost of commercial transactions. Fifth, They arc generally less disposed than private parties controlling equal capital to demand exorbitant rates of interest. But it does not follow from these view’s, nor would it follow from those of a similar character, which might be presented, that tho system is perfect/ nor does it follow that the issue of notes directly by the Gc/vem ment should be surrendered, and the business of furnishing a currency yielded to tho National Banks* The circulation of each bank is fixed arbitrarily by a rule of law* The aggregate circulation ia therefore a fixed sum, and quently there is practicably no reserve to meet the increased demand for money occasionally due to extraordinary events at home or abroad, and arriving occasionally with the incoming of the har vest. The old State Bank system is sometimes commended for a quality termed u elasticity,” but that quality as found in that system was the principal source of financial disasters. Under that system in tho abeyance of the present demand for coin, there was practicably no limit to the issue of a paper currency. The increase of the circulation was at tended and followed by an advance in prices; excessive importations, a consequent demand for coin drawn from the banks to meet balances abroad, a sim ultaneous reduction of the paper currency, and tho consequent distrust of merchants and bankers. As the circulation of a bunk is a source of profit, and as the managers are usually disposed to oblige their patrons by loans and accommodations, it can never bo Arise to alloAv banks and parties, a\-lio have pecuniary interests at heart, to increase or diminish the volume of currency in the country at their pleasure, nor do I find the condition of things a law or rule on which ire can safely rely. Upon these views I form the conclusion that the circulation of the banks should be fixed and limited, and that the power to change the A’olume of paper in circulation Arithin the limits established by law, should remain in the Treasury Department. A degree of elasticity in the volume of currency is essential for two reasons; First, The business of the Department cannot be tran sacted properly if a limit is fixed to the power to raise the circulation above or reduce below that limit is de nied, A rule of this nature would compel the Secre tory to accumulate a large currency balance and to hold St, as otherwise the credit of the Government in meeting the ordinary claims on it would be at the mercy of every serious business and political revolution in the United States or Europe. "Especially would this bo true now that our ordinary currency expenditures are greatly in excess of our currency revenue. Secondly. There is a necessity every autumn for moving the crops without delay from the South and Best to the seaboard, that they may be on hand for export and consumption as wanted. This work should be done in the main before the lakes, rivers, and canals are closed, and yet it cannot be done without the use of large amounts of currency. In the summer mouths funds accumulate at the centres, but the revival of business in August and September gives employment for large sums, and leaves little or nothing for for wardiing the crops in October and Novem ber. Nor would this difficulty bo obvi ated by a permanent increase or a permanent reduction of the volume of the currency. The diffi culty is due to the natural order of things, and in creases with the prosperity of the country. As shown in the abundance of its harvests, the crops cannot bo moved, generally, by the aid of bank balances, checks, and letters of credit, but only by bank notes and Uni ted States notes, paid at once to the producers. This money finds its way speedily into the channels of trade, and to the commercial centres, but if it be allowed to remain for general use after the reason lor its issue has ceased, the volume of currency would be increased permanently, and the year following the same process would be repeated, with the same result, and thus would the country de part more and more widely from the policy of resump tion. The problem is to find a way of increasing the cur rencyfor moving the crops, and diminishing it at once when that work is done. This is a necessary work, and, inasmuch os it cannot be confided to the banks, where but in the Treasury Department can the power be reposed ? While the currency revenue was in excess of the currency expenses, it was practi cal to accumulate largo balances in the Treasury dur ing the summer, to be used, if necessary, in tho purchase of the bonds in the autumn, thereby meeting the usual demand for currency at that season of the year. Hereafter such accumulation must be made by the sale of gold, and the sale of gold in large quantities during the summer, when business is the least active, may not always be consistent with the best interests of the country. Reliance cannot, therefore, be placed upon the ability of the Treasury to accumulate a cur rency balance each year for the purpose indicated. The aagument in favor of a paper currency, com posed in part of United States notes and in part of National Bank notes, is strengthened by the aid which may thus bo furnished in resuming and maintaining 

SPECIE PAYMENTS. In the view I am now about to take, I exclude tho idea that the Government will ever abandon the issue of National Bank notes and undertake the issue of United States notes in their place. The result of such a policy may be foreseen. The people, deprived of the facilities for business afforded by banks, would seek relief through State institutions, and, without much delay, Congress would concede to them the right to issue notes for circulation. This concession would be followed by a surrender by the General Gov ernment of all control over the paper circulation of the country. The true policy will be found in continuing the national banking system, without, however, yield ing an increase of its issue in proportion to the volume of Government paper in circulation. There are two effectual and certain ways of placing the country in a condition when specie and paper will possess the same commercial value. By diminish ing the amount of paper in circula tion, the difference between the commercial value of paper and coin will diminish, and by pursu ing this policy the difference will disappear altogether. All legislation, however limited in its operation to the paper issues of the banks and of the Government, whether bearing interest or not, and which in effect shall tend to diminish the market value of coin, will bo found upon analysis to contain a plan for controlling the volume of paper currency, and all legis lation so limited, which does not contain such a plan, will prove ineffectual. Accepting this proposition, and b lieving that tho country is not prepared to sanction the policy of contraction, it only remains for me to consider tho means by which the value of our currency may be improved. Tho basis of a policy of improvement must be found in a steady refusal to add to the paper in circulation, until it is of the same value substantially as coin. This being accepted as the settled purpose of the country, there can be no permanent increase of difference between paper and com, and an opportunity will be given for tho influ ence of national causes tending upon the whole to a better financial condition. We may count first among these the increase of population and its distribution over new fields of business and labor. -Secondly, in the South especially, the number of persons having property and using and holding money will increase. Next, we may anticipate more general use of paper in Texas and the Pacific States, by which, practically for tho rest of the country, the volume of paper will be dimin ished and the quantity of coin increased. Two facta tending to produce an equality of value in the influ ences of these natural causes will be counteracted in- some ■ degree by the increasing facility for the transfer of money from one point to another, and by the greater use of bank checks and certificates of deposit. The rapid transit of mer chandise in bringing the period of its consumption nearer to time of its production is an agency of a sim ilar sort. Giving these views their full weight, lam prepared to say that the experience of the last three years coincides with the best judgment I can form, and warrants the opinion that, under the influence of exist ing natural causes, our financial condition will gradu ally improve. During,tho last fiscal year there were several circum stances tending to counteract tho natural course of affairs. Our exports of cotton fell off thirty-seven million dollars, and there were excessive imports of wool, tea, coffee, and sugar. The stock of wool in warehouse on tho 80th of June was sufficient for six months’ consumption; of sugar, for four and a half months; of coffee, for five months, and after for twelve months. In the ordinary course of.trade, the importation of these articles will be small during the current year, with a consequent fav orable effectupon the balance between this and other countries. This anticipation of the wants of the country, in connection with tho decrease of our exports augmented the balance of trade; created an active demand for coin and advanced tho price. Notwithstanding these adverse influences, gold has averaged substantially the same premium from Jan. Ito Nov. I t of the present year, and for the corresponding period of 1871. Not doubting that natural causes will in time pro duce the result sought for, it is yet advisable to brine tho power of tho Government in aid of tho THE 

CHICAGO DAILY/TRIBU?IE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1872 movement os far as practicable. The revival of onr commerce ia one instrumentality, and, perhaps, the most efficient one of alb if the primal earn ings of American vessels were $80,000,000 in stead of $30,000,000, the difference in the amount of exchange available abroad would meet a largo part of the adverse balance on any ordinary year. The experience of Europe tends to show that the ability of a country to maintain specie payments is due largely to the condition of its foreign trade. Next, every measure which increases or improves the channels of transportation between the seaboard and cotton and grain growing regions of the country, or lessens the costs of freights, adds something to our ca pacity to compete successfully in the markets of the world. Finally, those measures which encourage American manufactures, especially of iron, wool, and cotton, and discourage the importation of like pro ducts, affect favorably the balance of trade and help us towards the end wo seek. This statement in these words is a general statement of a policy that, in my opinion, will aid the country in reaching a condition where it will be practicable to re sume and maintain spedo payments. Anticipating tharday, I anticipate also that the burden of resump tion will rest upon the Government. There are now more than nineteen hundred banks in the country, and I cannot imagine a condition of things so favorable, for a period of years, as to enable them, at all times, to redeem their notes In specie only. Without proceeding to the discussion of the subject in detail, I think that aU will have been gained that is of value when the Treasury 3hall be prepared to pay the demand notes of the Government in coin, and tho banka shall be prepared to pay their notes either in coin or in legal-tender notes, and then our good fortune will clearly appear in this, that our paper currency is not exclusively of National Bank notes, nor exclusively of United States notes.

It works with equal facility on muslin, cloth, cambric, tarleton, flannel and leather. It does not paralyze the spine or wear out the operator in any way, neither does it demand an Incessant stoppage to find out where the difficulty is. There is no difficulty. It runs smoothly and evenly, hems, fells, tucks, gathers and binds. It does the finest and most beautiful work on cambric and linen. It also has the merit of being cheaper than any other first class sewing machine, as it can be purchased for SSO. The feeding device is an improvement on all other machines, and is a special patent of the Wilson. It does not get out of order, nor break needles, nor slip, nor pucker the cloth.

OUR 

RAILWAYS. Additional and Important Lines Just Opened. The Iron Rail Laid to Lake Superior. The Iron Regions Opened Yesterday from Chicago by Rail. The First Arrival ia Chicago Over the Milwaukee & St. Paul. A New Cut-Off from Jefferson on the CL & N. N. E. W. The Menominee extension of the Chicago & Northwestern R: ulway, supplying the link neces sary to form a diitect all-rad line between Chi cago and Lake Superior, was completed yester day. When it is remembered that the extraor dinary demand for iron, and the exhaustion of former sources of supply have caused the heavi est iron manufactures *8 of the country to resort to the Lake Superior region for the ora neces sary to keep their fm maces at work, the impor tance of the new lino will be readily appreciated. During the current y ear, the utmost resources of the Northwestern Company were taxed to transport tho half a million of tons of ore shipped from 'Escanaba up to date. From this item alone, the incomplete Peninsula Di vision yielded an am mal income to the North western Company of SBOO,OOO. During the com ing year, one firm, mot hitherto in the field, con tract to ship over 103,000 tons. The shipments, previously suspended during the close of naviga tion, will now be continued throughout the win ter. The lino will be opened for business the last of this month, thus saving to the Company the valuable land-grant dependent upon the completion of this lirib this year. Tho branch lines from Stanwood, on the lowa division, to Tipton—a distance of miles ami from Geneva to Batavia—3 miles—were opened yesterday.

THE OUTS AND INS. The comity and city officials recently elected entered upon their duties yesterday. Mr. Joseph Poliak, the COVSTS CItESK, elected to fill the unexpired portion of the late Mr. Gindele’a term, took charge of . the office several days ago, relieving Colonel 'Wheeler, who was acting pro iem. Colonel Is’ileg, the efficient Clerk of the Connty Commissioners, has been reappointed with the unanimous approval of the Board. Mr. Scott, who distinguished himself during the campaign as Captain of a* Third Ward colored club, has received his reward'By appoint ment as copying clerk. Those are tirt' only ap pointments yet made. It is yet to ho decided whether Mr. Poliak comes under the provisions of the now Constitution and laws, which would limit his salary to $3,000 per annum, the salaries of his subordinates to be fixed by the County Board, or continues under the old Constitution in force when Mr. Gindele was elected, which would enable him to dr aw the fees as formerly, and leave him to pay the- sub ordinates as little as he could get them to work tor. THE SEW EECOHDEB, Colonel James Stewart, was duly installed as the successorof Mr. Gaasette. The latter gentleman left the hooks written up to the last moment, having kept the employes of the office working* day and mght during the last week. There was no weeping or wailing at the departure of Mr. Gaaaette. The lamentations were left unsung, but Sir. Cassette could afford it. He went out a wealthy man. According to his own statement, he maae $250,000 in the office, and is worth $400,000 all told. He intends to engage in the real estate and brokerage business, ana an nounced that in two years he would ho the suc cessor in Congress of the Hon. J. B. Rice. He was also disposed to take charge of a Chicago base ball club, believing that he could make it a success in every way. It will he seen, there fore, that Chicago has no immediate prospect of losing Mr. Cassette’s services in a pub lic capacity. The leave-taking oc curred on Saturday night. Mr. cassette presented most of the clerks with a cigar or two, and some with a supper, and the endearing and tender ties of fonr long years were fearlessly severed. Air. Stewart has appointed Captain John J. Healey Chief Clerk, in the place of Mr. Martin, the omy change to occur at present. Mr. Healey hag been serving the city as Clerk of the North Side Police Court, where he ably assisted Mr. Kauffman to dispense, or dispense with, justice, as the case might be, and being an apt and in telligent young man, ho will soon get the "hang” of his new duties. Mr. AI. Leßrun will remain in charge of the index department, and Mr. Jones of the folio room. These gentle men have been many years in the office, and are thoroughly acquainted with its routine. The County Board, under the new law, will fix the number and pay of the subordinates, which will be better for them. Under the old regime the Recorder paid them out of his enormous fees, and, of course, the cheaper he got the work done the more money he pocketed. Salaries averaged sls a week all round, and folio writing was done at three cents per hundred words, printed matter not being counted or paid for. THE CIBCUrr CLERK. Mr. Jacob Gross succeeds Mr. Gassette as Clerk of the Circuit Court. Mr. Eli Smith, who has been connected with the Courts for many years, will be his deputy. THE STATE’S ATTORNEY. Mr. Charles H. Reed entered upon his third term. Having no subordinates, he made no changes, and the office will he run as usual. Tim Bradley began his second term. The Judges have decided to do with one less bailiff in each of the six law courts. This will reduce the Sheriff’s force. The names of the decapi tated will not he known Tint.il to-day. Conrad Polz will continue os jailor. the couoneb. Captain John Stephens also began a second term. He expects to have the appointment of a deputy, hut will not make a selection until the County Board fixes tho compensation. THE COUNTY CO2QII6SIONEBS met as a new Board and elected Commissioner Miller President for the ensuing year. The Board will have to elect new officers. Dr. Ben.

Such an event was unprovided for by the action of the Convention.

CcrcnwAH, 0., Dec. 2.—The Commercial, this morning, in an article on the casting of tie Tote for the President by the Greeley electors, says in relation to the voting for Grant: “In any event, the South is not likely to lose anything .by giving its entire electoral vote to a magnanf luoua General, -who was once a Democrat, and a I resident who can afford to be generous and in ipartiaL” •.The Enquirer favors voting for Greelev and Brt iwn, and concludes by saying: “ The* cam paij m has been faught on the Liberal side in the cant eof air.

The first meeting of the Board of Connty Commissioners for the new year was held yester day afternoon. Present, Messrs. Harris, Miller, Bogne, Pahlman, Harrison, Galloway, Ashton, Herting, Lonergan, Roelle. Mr. Harrison was elected temporary* Chairman. The credentials of Messrs. Clough, Singer, Russell, Crawford, and Jones, the newly elected members of the Board, .were read, and they took their seats. Mr. Crawford movedto proceed to the election of a Chairman, and it was agreed to. An informal ballot was had, resulting: Miller, 3; Ashton, 7; Lonergan, 1; Harrison, 1; Singer, X.

Mr, Miller was declared elected, took his seat, and returned his thanks for the confidence re posed in him, and hoped that they would try during the coining year to decrease the connty expenses if possible. They mustbe vigilant and careful in making contracts for the buildings which were to be erected, and to see that the county got fuH value for all it paid.

COURTS. A petition in review was yesterday filed in the United States Circuit Court, praying the revision ■of Judge Blodgett’s decision not to order the re moval of the Assignee. The petitioners affirm that the Smiths, McMullens, Perkins the As signee, and others, received an issue of stock amounting to nearly a million, to enable them to control the January, 1871, meeting, paying only a nominal sum therefor,—24 per cent,-anl con tend that they are liable topay the Company the hMance, or 66 per cent. They further contend that the requirements of law as to depositions accompanying claims have not been complied with, and that the Assignee has neglected his duty m allowing dividends to ho paid on claims evidently illegal. The Assignee Las been ruled to answer by the 9th inst. . The Knickerbocker Insurance Company have filed an affidavit in the Cook County Courts, where suits have been brought for the recovery ’°'? ea on the Company’s policies, affirming prejudice existed in the mind of the people of Cook County that a fair trial was impossible, and a change of venue necessary. The voluminous 150-page review in the State Insurance Company, and the score or so of mat tera tnut present themselves to the view of the law reporter for his diurnal slashing, gracefully give way to the imperative demands of the printer, the President, and the Mayor.

POLICE FORCE. The Board of Fire and Police Commissioners met yesterday afternoon at 3 o’clock. President Beno in the chair. Present Commissioners Sheridan and Klokke. The resignation of officer Charles A. Krenzer, of the Eleventh Precinct, Third District, was re ceived and accepted. The charges against officer John Halhut, of in toxication, were taken under advisement until to-day. Patrolmen John Ennis and Michael Quinlan were charged with having left their beats and hugged a stove in a hospitable house, on a cold mght, where Sergeant O’Donnell discovered them, Quinlan being comfortably asleep. He stated, as an excuse, that he had been on duty for thirty consecutive hoars. Both men were fined ten days’ pay, besides being reprimanded. t , Thomas Grotty, a probationary officer, who had neglected to return to the station a sum of money found by him, belonging to Bev. Father uOaMey, was dropped from the police force. Officer Timothy Mahoney, a regular police man, was charged with having faUed to make a proper return of the warrant he was ordered to serve upon Crotty in the above case.

Defalcation by tbo President and Cashier of the Wallkm (if, x.\ Bank* Middletown, If, T,, (Aop. 26,) Corespondenee qf the 2fev> York Times, xhifl place was the scene of some excitement yesterday by the report that ex-Senator Wm. M. Graham, President of the Wallkill National Bant, and Charles H. Horton, Esq., Cashier of the,same institution, were defaulters to the amount of $200,000, and that the bank had been compelled to suspend. That the bank had sus pended there was no doubt, and an investiga tion into its affairs soon revealed the fact that the President and Cashier were defaulters, but not in as large an amount as reported They have used the money in the bank to the amount of probably 

SIOO,OOO, and $25,000 or $30,000 in bonds and securities placed in the bank by dif ferent parties for safe-keeping, are missing. It seems that Graham and Morton have been operating in stocks in Wall street for some time, and have been mutual indorsers. They have been putting up margins from time to time, and were dually, swamped by the great corner in Northwestern. One day last week a draft for $14,000 on the Wallkill Bank was sent for collection to its agents in New York, the Park Bank, and was protested. This became known; depositors took the alarm, and a run on the Wallkill Bank was the consequence, resulting in its suspen sion on Tuesday. Mr. Horton, the Cashier, loft town on Friday or Saturday last, and was not heard of until Monday, when Senator E. M. Madden receined a telegram from him, from New York, request ing an interview. He reports Horton as being in a pitiable state of mind, and there is no doubt but he was led into bin present difficulty by evil nflnences. Graham endeavors to shift all the responsibility of the appropriation of'the bank funds on Horton, hut it is the general impres sion here that the former was the principal in transactions. For two or three years Graham's course of life has been extremely inconsistent with the position he has held, and the Board of Directors of the suspended bank are generally having a full knowledge of the way ths affairs _ qf the institution were managed, for maintaining Graham in the position of President. Horton has long been the most popular ma-n in this section of the country. He was the lead ing Democratic politician of Western Orange ; was last spring elected Supervisor in a Bepub lican district by an overwhelming majority, and was this fall the Democratic candidate for Con gress in the Twelfth District, against Hon. Charles St. John. He is the son-in-iaw of Hon. E. P. Wheeler, Vice President of the Midland Bailroao, who is almost crazed at the position of affairs. It is a singular fact that the father-in-law of Mr. Graham, Mr. 8. V. Denton, and the father-in-law of Mr. Horton, are the two heaviest stockholders in the bank. Mr. Horton was a leading member of the Pres byterian Church here, and no enjoyed the confidence or respect of the entire community more than he. All sympathize with him, and if he had remained here, everything, as far as he was concerned, would hare been arranged satis factorily. Much and serious inconvenience to business men will be the result of the failure of this bank. Many men having paper coming due deposited funds in the bank on the day of its suspension to meet their obligations. This has all been used to meet the demands of suspicious depositors. A consider able portion of the Homoeopathic Insane Hospi tal Pond was deposited in the hank, and it is probable that work on that building, now under fair headway, will be necessarily suspended, throwing hundreds of men out of employ. There is some doubt as to whether the hank wul be_ continued after settlement of its affairs. If it is, it will be under a new name and new direc tory. An examiner has been asked from the State Superintendent of Banks, and until the re sult of his investigation of the books is known, no definite idea of the exact condition of affairs can be formed. It is generally believed that matters are worse than the estimate of the Di rectors would make them. THE 

DEATH PENALTY. Execution of Michael Moore for the Murder of JBUs Wife* Ebenbbubg, Pa., Nov. 27.—Michael Moore, ■whose crimes are among the blackest on record, was executed here today, in the jailyard at tached to the prison. On the Ist of lose March the body of a woman, burned almost to a crisp, was found near Mineral Point Station, on the Pennsylvania Railroad. It proved to be Moore’s first wife, who had deserted him on account of brutal treatment, and went to Philadelphia, where she resided as domestic for some years after the separation. Moore married again, telling the clergyman who married him that his first wife was dead. His earliest spouse appears to have been still true to him, and the neighbors, complaining of Moore living there with a woman not his lawful wife, gutted the place in January, whereupon Moore went to Philadelphia, and induced his first wife to leave her home there and accom pany him to Mineral Point. The unsuspecting woman did so, and, on the 29th of February last, Moore, with his wife, got off the train at Min eral Point. He enticed her to a deep woodland, where he most brutally butchered her, and made a bon fire of her remains. Tracks in the snow led to and from the spot where the deed was commit ted. Footprints led to the house of Moore. He was arrested, tried, and convicted, and to day was fixed for the execution. He is a mart of brutal disposition, but cowardly in heart, and last night paced nis cell to and fro, weeping as if his heart would break, and trembling like a leaf at the thought of tho fate awaiting him on the morrow; He declared his innocence of the crime, and accused his brother of being the instrument of his execution. He was attended by Father Christie, of the Catholic Church, and by -the Sisters of St. Joseph. He passed a sleepless night, but got an hour of repose this morning. At 11:50 a mournful procession approached the gallows, headed by Sheriff Bonacker, the con demned, and Father Christie. Moore appeared quite calm, and walked boldly with a crucifix in hishanda and responding to the Litany of Souls recited by the priest. I On the scaffold being reached, he took a seat on a chair, and submitted to the operation of his legs being bound. The Sheriff then said, “Mike, if you have got anything to say, now is the time to say it.” Moore replied, “ No, nothing more than to ask you all to pray lor me, that Goa may forgive my sins.” The black cap was then drawn over his head, and the priest and Deputy Sheriffs loft the scaf fold. The bolt holding the trap in place was withdrawn, and Moore fell like a log. His neck snapped so distinctly that it could be heard by those near the platform. The body spun around and around, and after banging twenty-five minutes was cut down and placed in a coffin. Moore said all along that he would declare his innocence on the scaffold, hut failed to do so, and, in consequence, is now gen erally believed to have been guilty of all the crimes laid to his charge. Hia body will be buned at 2 o clock by the graves of Housen and Bonser, who were executed here in 1866, A Young- Lpay Takes a Pleasure Bide and Returns a Corpse. Front theMatio<m{!U.) Journal. no have the partietdara of a most distressing case of sudden and mysterious death of a young lady, Miss “Pet” Hyatt, daughter of Benjamin Hyatt, Esq., -who resides one and a half miles southeast of Etna. It appears that on Sunday afternoon Mr. Benjamin Coleman, a young man who resides in the neighborhood, procured a livery team at Neoga, and, stopping at the young lady’s residence, inyited her to xido frith him to Etna. She complied "with his request and they started. Coleman remarked to some relatives of Miss H., who were just starting on a to the village, that they would arrive at Etna about the same time. In a very short ume after starting, Coleman returned with Mha H. a corpse in the buggy I In reply to anxious questions from relatives, ho first stated that hia team had started to run away, and, overturning the baggy, had thrown the lady out, killing tst instantly, bnt a few moments afterwards, in response to the remark of a brother of the unfortunate girl, Yon have murdered my sis* ter, Coleman protested that Hiss H. had be £9.®?® frightened and jumped from the killing herself in the fail. After the corpse was removed from the buggy, Coleman drove rapidly to Neoga, delivered up the team to the owner, mid disappeared, and has not been heard from since. An inquest is being held to-day (Tues day), when further particulars may bo brought to light. A rumor prevails, this morning, that chloroform was administered to the girl, as there were no marks of violence to be found on the body. A SUGGESTION TO BUILDERS. A timely suggestion to soma of the propritx tors of incompleted buildings may save iKorry immense trouble in the future. There are very many handsome blocks, finished and unfinished, whose foundations are not protected by side walks or anything else. We would recommend them to place a thick layer of manure round such foundations to keep out the frost, op by next spring unpleasant fissures will ap pear in the atone, which will be reduced to powder by the superincumbent weight of the buildings. The action of frost on unseasoned sand-stone can be observed in the southern block of that material support ing the porch of Andrews’ building on LaSalld street, between Madison and Monroe. A huge crack, caused by the action of frost, baa split the enormous stone down the centre, dividing it as evenly as no artificial process could have done. This atone when freshly quarried is extremely porous, and absorbs moisture readily. The frost does the rest more readily stilL THE CITY IN BRIEF.
