FREE BALLOT AND FAIR COUNT. Continued opp&aition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred upon the col ored people by the recent amend Bier.U to the Constitution. sUfi pre vails in severnl of the late slave holii ing State. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent e'ec tion to any lurge extent in acts of violence cr iuttmidation. It has. however, by fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots, with the regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with count ing, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in de feating the extreme of the riyht pre servative of ail rights, the right of suffrage, which the Constitution ex pressly confers upou our enfranchis ed citizens. It is the desire of the good pec pie of the whole country that, sec tionalism aa a factor in our politics hftulJ disappear. They prefer that no section of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedi ence to the equal rights amendments to the Constitution, is all that row stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional liner in our political contests. As lo:g aa either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is pafe to Msiime that the people who placed them in the Constitution, as embody ing the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to b wise ar.d necessary, will con tinue to act together, and to inns! that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question etill is. as to the enjoyment f the right by every American citizen wlm has the re quisite qualification, to lieely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted. With this question right ly Bettled, the country will be re lieved of th contentions of the past, bygones will indeed be bygone, and political and party issues with re . sped to economy and efficiency f administration, internal impiove ucents, the tariff, ionien'!c taxation, education, finance, ai d other impor tant subject:;, ill then receive their full share of attention; but resist ance to and nullification of the re sults of the war, will unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of the government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately ap preciate .the valu; of the victory achieved. This determination pro ceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to sn' part of the people of out country. Or to any of -their in terests.' The , ii-violabilily of the amendments reel upon the funda mental principle of our government. They are folium., expression of th j will of the people ol the Uniiud States. . ' Happily, the history o' the lute election thows thai in many parts ot ibe country where 'opposition to Hit afteenlb amenriueut Las heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing, and id likely to cease altogether, if firm and well-considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senat'J which have the right to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members, will see t that every case of .viola'-ion of the letter or spirit of the fifteen amend ment in thoroughly investigated, and that no beneBt from such violation shall accrue to any person or party, civil service reform. In my former annual raesages, have ask-d the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity of a reforma- tionofthe civil service system of the Government. My views con- cerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments for personal or parlis- an considerations, have been strength etied by my observation and expert- ence in the Executive office, and I believe these dangers threaten the si ability of the Government. Abuse9 so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of administrative ser vice, as the growth of the country in population increases the number of oiucers and place-men employed. The most serious obstacle, how- ever, to an improvement of the civil service, and especially to reform in the method of appointment and re- moTal, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, by which the ap- pointing power has been sa largely encroacheii upon by raembsrs of Congress. The first step in the re- form of the civil service must be a- complete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupt doctrine that "to the victors belong the tpous, is inseparable from Cocgres- tional patronage as the established r-.de and practice f parties in power. It comes to be understood by appli cants for office, and by the people generally, that Representatives and Senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective dis tricts and States. It Is recommended that an act be passed defining the relations of mem bers of Congress nith respect to the appointment to office by the Presi dent, I also recommend that the pro visions of section 1767, and of the sections following, of the Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure of- office act, of March 2, 1867, be re pealed. 

POLTOAMY. Polygamy will not be abelished if the enforcement of the law depends on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only be surprcti ed by taking away the political pow er of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of Congress ts enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a cfise for half way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing ; it controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. It is extending steadi ly into other Territories. Wherever it goe9 it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanc tity of marriaje and the family re Iatin are the corner-stone of our American society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separation f Church and State are among the elementary ideas of free insti tutions. To re-establish the inter ests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, in a great degree, closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it is recommended that the govern ELent of the Territory of Utah be reorganized. I recommend that Coxgress pro vide for the government of Utah by a Governor and Judges, or Commi siners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analagotis to the pro visional government established for the territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787. If, how ever, it is deemed best to continue the exiatiag form of local govern ment, Irecomuaeftd that the right to vote, hold office, and sit on juries In the Territory of Utah, be confined to those who neither practice nor up hold polygamy. FOREIGN RELATIONS. The President reports the countrj on amicable terms with the nations of the earth and hopes the fishery troubles that have grown out of df vergent interpretations of the treaty at Washington by Ettgla-d and this government, may -peedily be settled to the satisfaction of bot h.

These notes long sisce beeame like any other pecuniary obligation of the Government a debt to be paid, and. j whea paid, to be cancelled at mere evidence of an indtbtedness n long er existing. I tlnrsfore repeat wbat was said in the annual message of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in eur progress towards a safe and stabU currency, which sheuld be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest i ... j f ii.. i . silver dollar The Constitution, in express terms recognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal-tender money. To baaish either of these metals from our currency is to Barrow and limit iho circulating medium of ex i change to the disparagement of im- portant interests. The United States produces more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the twe precious metals which furnish the coinage tf the world. It will, in my judgmer', contribute to this result if i Congrea will repeal so much of ex-1 isting legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412 graios of silver, and ia its stead will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dol lars of equivalent value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will bo in accordance with familiar precedents. Congress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and sil ver, in order t establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two tueUls.

HEATHEN CHINEE. The provision made by Congress, at its lut session, for the expense of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the Imperial Government of Cnina, on subjects of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the commissioners to pro ceed a! once, upon their mission. The Imperial Gvernment was pre pared tr give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought un der negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that, oa the 17th of Novem ber last, two treaties were signed at Pekiti, one relating to the introduc tion of Chinese into this country, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot. one of the ccmmisifMierg, is now cn his way home bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before the Senate early in January.

The enthusiasm, which oaly two years ago appeared to. surpass all bound, has cmider ably cooled.? THREE THANKSGIVINGS. Four years ago this present Thanksgiving. Judge Cleveland house of Co., N. II. was the scene of unusual festivities. The most extensive preparation had been made for the comfort and pleasure of some thirty or forty invUed guests, for t he judge was an old fashioned host and liked to en' ei tain sumptu ously. Rodney, the judge's son was home from college for a week, and bad brought with him a few friends whose homes were too far away to enable them to go ana return in the short time allotted for a vacation Mrs. Cleveland was a delicate lit tle lady several yearr younger than her husband, who deligated to please him by keeping open house, second ing his desires and hie whims wltli astonishing patience, for Julge Cleveland was known to be some thing of an autocrat, and had been heard to say that his will was alway aw in his own house. The gentle man's will was always law on the bench and while very generous to the poor and suffering, was sure to give evil doers the severest penal ties the statutes afforded. Judge Cleveland's father hsd always had a sideboard in his h use, and the judge insisted on perpetuating the custom, although his wife by persuasion, and even tears, had constantly used her influence against it. Judge Cleve land believad in wine at dinner, and a drink of brandy whenever he felt like it. "A man with a mind," he was accustomed to say, "knew when to leave off, and a man without a mind would get drunk anyhow." The judge frequently boasted that he was sure his son would never im bibe any bad habits with the wine he drank at his father's table. Wine had always been as free as water in the Cleveland family, and from first to last there had never been a drunkard by that name. The judge was accustomed to close his remarks on this subject by declaring that ' if such a thing should happen that Rodney should ever become the worse for liquor, and he found it out, then Rodney and he parted corapa ny for the rest of their lives." Mrs. Cleveland. wh knew that her boy would bo baniihed at once and for ever, if an accident of this kind should occur, which, under the cir cumstances, seemed to the anxious mother more than likely, wa always ill at ease during the time of any extraordinary festivities. Just be fore sitting down to the sumptuous Thanksgiving dinner, Mrs. Cleve land took advantage of a spare mo ment, to give her son the usual warning. "What a funny little UJU..UIM : .augueu lue ,uu.,g in., i' i i i . i i he put his arm about the shght fig ure and looked down into her eyes with unu'terable love. T shall drink only the mildest Catawba, ar-d only just enough of that to keep up the good,will of the establishment. I wonder if I were to get a little top heavy," he continued in the same tone of bandinage, "if father would turn me out as he has always threat ened 1" "Rodney, he would!" Mrs. Cleveland replied, with more empha sis than seemed necessary to her j laughing eon. "I have suffered more ! with nervous horror about that pos- j sible circumstance than with every- j thing else I have had to bear put j together. Oh ! my boy. you will j never know how cruel and wicked it j seems to me to put temptation be fore a young mau and then threaten to disinherit him if he succumbed to it. Oh ! Rodney, for your mother's sake be careful." At this moment dinner was announced, and Rodney led his mother to her seat, and then leaning over her said softly : "I wouldn't do anything to hurt you for all the world, mother. Trust me. for I'm a Cleveland, you knew." 1 This last quotation was from his father's oft-repeated words, and Mrs. Cleveland smiled a faint little smile at her son's exact reproduction of the judge's manner. "There is nothing sure but the un foreseen," 6ays an old French pro verb, and it certainly seemed true in this case. Dinner passed off in ex cedent style, Rodney's behavior be ing as usual entirely satisfactory. As the young man never touched anything from the sideboard, Mrs. Cleveland's fears were quite lulled to rest. One of Rodney's friends seemed a little flushed after dinner, but after all Rodney's friend wasn't Rodney, although Mrs.. Cleveland would have shielded from tempta tion every young man at her tahle with the same motherly r'egaid which she threw about her own koh. There were old-fashioned. gme for the children in the afternoon, and a seven o'clock teai " After tea Rodney and bis friends went out for a stroll, and- when at eleven o'clock the Thanksgiving party broke up, the young" men had not returned. Mrs. Cleveland been, growing stead ily anxioas, and when twelve came without any igo of the truants, she was sure that the worst bad happen e l. 1 lr; could oi ly induce the judge lo go to bed, then there might be a possibility that the belated par ty could come in and letire without being seen ; for the judge was a gaod sleeper, usually dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow. But no! the judge had made up his mind, and nothing that his wife oould say was of the slightest avail At last he exclaimed, irritably : "Go to bed If vou want to and let me alone. I tell you I am going to sit up and find out what ha kept those boys out so late. It look very sua Diciom to me. and if anything has happened you know the result, wife, for I've been pretty careful for the last ten vears to see that you and Rodney understood." The clock chimed out one, two, and still the judge sat erect in his chair while his wife, pale as a ghost with terror, flitted from room to room, aud window to window, peer ing out into darkness, listening for some 9ign, uuti! it, seemed to ber as if the very blood stood still in her veins. It was almost three o'clock when her quick ear caught the sound of muffled voices by the back door. The judge's hearing waa as keec as his wife's on this occasion, and he immediately sprang to the door and threw it wide open. It needed but a glance to see that all of the young men had been drinking heavily. The judge cast one glance of supreme disgust at the unsteady crowd, then said in tones of thunder: "Get out of here, the whole raft of you ! You can send a message for your traps in the morning you, Rodney, with the rest; and never, as long as you live. do you dare to cross my threshold. for from this day to the day of my death you are no son of mine." Oh 1 husband I' shrieked the wretched mother, "let them come in I oh, for my sake let them come In ! Do not turn your son from his home for this his first offence !" Here the door was slammed in the five, by this time, almost sobered faces, and Judge Cleveland with an iron grip led his wife to the library. Then Im hold relaxed, and the heart brok en woman fell to the floor ia a mer ciful trance. A whle year passed after this dreadful affair, and Mrs. Cleveland received but one letter from her son. This was sent under covor to a neighbor. Rodney was going abroad with a friend, in hopes of getting something to do, so that he might continue his studies. At this time Mrs. Cleveland sent her son all the money she could raise without her husband s knowledge, aud now an other Thanksgiving day had rolled round without any more Dews of him. Judge Cleveland kept open. house flJ .fe sat at the head of his table and entertain ed his guests; but they all knew that her heart was not in the festiv ities, and when the wine eparkled in the glasses, and talk flowed freely around the table, the moiher s face was as ashen a when, on that awful night, she waited her son's return. There was no wineglass at her plate, and when the judge insisted on toasting her, as was his custom on festive occasions, hi3 wife replied, No, I thank you, judge. I am not thankful for wine, therefore you must always excuse me." As this was the first time in a married life of twenty two years that Mrs. Cleve land had ever, in public or private, addressed a pointed rema-k to her husband, perhaps it was not strange that the judge had no answer ready. A few month. after this Judge Cleveland died very suddenly t and when his will was opened, it was found that he had not only disinher ited his son, but had arranged his properly so that, iu the event of his widow recalling her child, she should have only two-thirds of the estate, and this under a protest of such an inflammatory nature, that the lawyer who read the document stopped short several times, and looked roujid wonderingiy on the assembled company. A third of the estate woul i be more than euough to sup port the widow comfortably; but in case that 8he accepted the amount, which the testator seemed to think very doubtful, she was to be driven from the homestead, and in every possible way straitened and anuoyed. All those who knew Judge Cleveland well, felt sure that he would be hard to the last, but no one supposod that even his obsti nancy could go so far as : this. Friends flocked around to sympa thize with his doubly bereaved wo man. To the numerous questions of what 6he would , do, Mrs. Cleve land made. but. one" answer, and this wa: ".Help me. to find my sou;" aud all understood, from this that the piopert'i the whole of a third war- to her but a trifling considera tion. For three iuoiiths everybody did help. Letters and telegrams were sent iu all, directions, and ev .ery effort made'that hiimau ingenui ty could inveut ; but all to no pur p03e.' Rodney Cleveland was either dead, of purposely keeping out of tie way. The nes t Judge Ciee land's will had spread far and wide and a few of Rodney's iutimati 'riends were convinced that the las sheory was correct. "He would nev er return to impoverish his mother,' they said ; for. although Rodney hao much of his mother's gentleness, ht also possessed considerable of hi father e doggedness, and would doubtless die rather than bring pov erty lo the moiher he so Idolized. At last still another Thanksgi v ing day dawned upon the earth, anil ihe widow, childless and forsaken, sat alone in her home. She drove to church as usual in the morning, and there was hardly a tlry eye in the house, when the lonely woman. claal in the deepest mourning, walk ed slowly up the aisle, and took her seat in the deserted pew. Ohluon she prayed for help, asd how far away 6ecmed the divine hand ! Af ter the service was over, her friends pressed round to speak to her, but her eyes seemed looking far away, and her manner was so strange, tha; it was not to be wondered at tbe all thought the poor lady was losing her mind. At noon she eat. down to her solitary dinner; but the eovlii uot bear the great dirmer-roou". with its memories of former Thanks givings, and the dinner was taken away untasted. In the afternoon everal of the neighbors dropped in. but she refused herself to all, and when night came, she had tea made m the little sitting-room, where she and Rodney used sometimes lo take their 6upper wheu the judge was away. "Un ! do, ror mercy s sake," said one of the servants, who had ived with Mrs. Cleveland ever siuce sje was married, "let me go and in vite somebody to come in and have teavith you. It breaks my heart to see you here alone I" You shall have tea with me, Sarah," said her mistress, trying to smile, "for it doesn't annoy me to have you with me, and we will talk of the old limes, Sarah, when Rodney was a little boy." Sarah drew up the table, and hung the kettle over the "downier fire. O CD with the tears streaming down her cheeks. "I shall be awful poor company, Mrs. Cievetand, if you don t chirp up a little," Sarah re plied. "I don't think I was made to be of any use in trouble," she con tinued, "for I always get to blub bering so." "Oh, Sarah !" said Mrs. Cleveland, in the old agoaizing tone, "if I only knew whether my boy was alive or dead. Tell me again what you think." Sarah at that moment was adjust leg a slice of bread to the toasting fork, and all ef a euddea the bread fell to the floor, and iiarah uttered a slight scream. She had seen a pair of eyes peeping through the partly closed blinds, and had recognized theai at ooce. For a moment or two the busied herself with her work, abstaining carefully from looking again at the window, "1 think, just as I always have, that Mr. Rodney is alive," the woman answered with considerable deliberation, though every uerve in her body was ilng liag with excitement, "and I thiuk, when somebody gets the best of him, he'll come popping in upwn you all of a sudden. Mrs. Cleveland, it you'll please to hold this toasting fork a minute, I'll go out and get the milk." The sitting-room windows opened to the floor, and Sarah p&sVcd care lesidy about the room, adjusting the Concluded on Fourth Page s 71 X ' 1 F !
