"The 14th of December will be the one hundredth anniver sary of the death of Washington. For one hundred years the republic has had the priceless ad vantage of the lofty standard of character and conduct which he bequeathed to the American peo ple. It is an inheritance which time, instead of wasting, continu ally increases and enriches. We may justly hope that in the years to come the benignant influence of the father of his country may be even more potent for good than in the century which is drawing to a close. I have been glad to learn that in many parts of the country the people will fittinlgy observe this historic anniversary." Presi dent McKinley's Message. Elsewhere in this issue is printed a copious extract of Hon. Wendell P. Stafford's address on the Philippines at Bellows Falls on Dec. 2. It is full of patriotic utterances and com manded the closest attention during its delivery. The St. Albans Messen ger and the Rutland News, and pos sibly some other papers, have inti mated that oratory and eloquence do not count in Congress, but the average Vermonter knows better and as a sample of the style and patriotism of Mr. Stafford we sub mit the resume of his recent Bellows Falls address. It has been many a year since Vermont has had a congressional candidate so eloquent in address, so scholarly in thought, and so learned in our national history and it is no wonder that his candidacy is attracting wide atten tion and growing in strength.

An Error of Judgment. Our friend Editor Ropes of the Watchman is getting excited early in the campaign. He is evidently much disturbed over our comments last week on the senatorial situation, and among other extravagant things intimates that the article in last week's Caledonian was written by Gen. Grout. We had not supposed m ..... it so able as to warrant that sus- picion, but the green eyes of the Montpelier editor see Gen. Grout in .. everything This naoer is not edited from Washington and the only Washing ton correspondent we have signs ini tials to the letters. The editorials that appear in this paper are the creations of the editor's brain and the imaginations of our contempo rary are somewhat amusing as well as flattering. Out of his imagination, also, he magnifies Mr. Prouty's candidacy, which he gravely tells his readers threaten's Gen. Grout's lines in the northeast. Everyone in this part of the state knows that this is all moonshine, but the visionary editor of the Watchman thinks it is true or he would not say so. We cannot better dismiss this vagary than by saying, "Wait and see." -

Among the list of prospective can didates mentioned for congressional honors in the Second district is the name of Porter II. Dale, of Island Pond. Just how Mr. Dale looks upon the question of his candidacy is only a matter of conjecture, as he has never expressed himself publicly upon this subject, so far as we can discover. That he would balance equally well in the scales with the other candidates for this office there is but little room to doubt. A bitter fight will be waged against Col. Haskins from certain counties in the district, and the same bitter fight will be waged against Wendell P. Stafford from other counties. The counties of Essex and Orleans are liable to oscillate between the two. Should Porter II Dale with his numerousfnends throughout the dis- trict, and against whom no flaw can be found, consent to be a candidate for second district congressional honors, we believe he would not only be heartily endorsed by his own countv and that of Orleans, but would receive a strong following in the other counties.

(From our regular correspondent.) Congress opened with an unusual ly large concourse of people in atten dance; it was thought that there were over 20,000 people in and out side of the Capitol seeking entrance upon Monday, Dec. 4. A large pro- portion were women, who felt that the cause of woman and home were at stake in the Bngham Robert s case, and they were eager to obtain entrance to the House but all of the seats were reserved for the first two days for members and their friends, hence the public at large wereexclud ed, which raised a storm of criticism among the people who wondered if Consress was intended onlv for re. presentatives, their families and friends. The question was asked. have the tax-payers of the country any rights and privileges or are we drifting on to monarchy. Two years ago a southern member brought in eleven women, including his wife, for reserved seats in the gallery, and he was not a Mormon Several such infringements of mem hers' rights led them to divide the seats equally among the members. The door-keeper reported that each representative received this year only three seats. The Robert's case has been referred to a special committee, with Chair man Taylor who represents the re publicans, and Representative Rich ardson, the leader of the minority (democrats) to bring out the two sides of the case. Roberts is a very persistent, obstinate man and in tends to fight it out to the bitter end. Immense rolls of anti-Roberts' petitions were brought into Con- grtss, which Koberts ridiculed a9 those of Sunday schools and thinks his case should go to the judiciary cotnruittee He accused the Presi- , r . . , dent of appointing Utah men who were charged with polygamy, to life positions. Representative Dalzell pointedly asked, "Were they guilty ?" AnAA A- . , . . , He dodged a d,rect "P1 but 8a,d they were charged with that misde- meanor. He has a daughter for his secretary. Representative Taylor made a good point at the dose of tbe debate about admitting Roberts , TT . , 8 . to the House and then turning him out, Dy quoting some poetry written 1 1 . , . , . wnen one wunin tne aoors said, , "i hear a Hon iu the lobbv roar.

Senator Quay will not present his case until a little later. Senator Clark, the new sena tor from the west was another new. member who excited much interest as the man who is variously report ed as a man who has an income of $20 a minute, or of over $1,000,000 per month or still later as having an income of $13,000,000 per year; a poor man when he went west and in vested in lands which have proved to have invaluable mines. Senator Frye filled the late Vice President's chair. The House has been deluged with bills of all descriptions. A bill for a Trans-Pacific Cable has been introduced by Representative Corliss of Michigan to be built to Hawaii, Japan and China and the Philippines by the government at a cost of $,- 000,000. Senator Chandler of New Hampshire wishes to have free trade between the islands of Porto Rico and Cuba in 1900. Dr. S. H. Green of the Calvary Baptist church, received a handsome den d him by his church and congre- gation on tne twentietn anniversary. He came here from Northern Ver mont a vounc. fresh, theological stu dent to a church burdened by debt and his success has been most phe nominal, in building up a great church and he has the largest Sun day school in the city and one that interests many to visit. He richly deserved the many encomiums of praise received. The 50th anniver sary of the pastorate of Dr. J. G. Butler of the Luther Memorial church was held at the Arlington hotel, when '250 guests consisting of sena tors, representatives and prominent citizens- participated. The church has a very five statue of Martin Luther in front of it. Justice Brewer of the Supreme Court who is something of a wit did not know why the Supreme Court never had had a chaplain, whether it was because they were too good or too bad but all united in pro claiming Dr. Butler a power for good in restraining evil in his six years as a chaplain in the House and nearly that in the Senate. The Masons will celebrate the death of George Washington on Dec. 14 at Mt. Vernon, when 50 lodges will probably take part and President McKinley is expected to make the address, as the 25th successor in office. The Great Council of Red Men of the United States not to con flict with the other organization will observe the lOOtanniversary in the anernoon when a wreath ot oak and evergreen sent from Yorkshire, Eng land, by the Earl of Londesborough Park, will be placed on the tomb of Washington, John Washington, the founder of the family having come from that vicinity. A poem also will be read, written by the rector of the Earl, and the Prince of Wales, Master Mason in England has sent a letter of regrets to the other so ciety. Chauncey Depew has been in vited to deliver the oration in the evening in Convention Hall and Con gress is expected to be largely repre sented. The marine band and the Abyon Society will furnish music. The different chapters of the D. A R. society of Washington gave a two days' entertainment at Rauscher's upon Thursday and Friday after noon and evening for the Memorial Hall fund. Manv 01 the ladies were dressed in colonial costumes and there was an interesting loan collec tion of historic articles. The tickets were one dollar for each session. Miss Pierce, of Boston, niece of Mrs J. liiien roster, and others sang charmingly. Miss Pierce sang by request, the well-known song ' The Pilgrim Fathers," which was highly appreciated. There were six tab leaux, "She was justly proud of her ancestors," "Ancient and Modern Courtesy" and "The New Woman." The latter was quite effective. A young girl mounted on her bicycle while the old courtiers of George Washington's time looked on with astonishment and holy horror. The first of the two lectures to be given on "The Philippines and the tar bast," before the National ueo graphic Society attracted a large andience because the lecturer, Hon. John Barrett, had been the United States minister to Siam four years and had also traveled extensively in China, Japan, Siberia, Borneo, Java, Uurman and visited tbe Philippines when Admiral Dewey was there, all of which made his opinions and ideas exceedingly interesting. He consid ered it from a practical material standpoint. He visited those coun tries and studied the question to learn what opportunities they af forded for American trade. He con sidered Manila a location ot great importance and an ideal center for a new Oriental capital, for Hong Kong only 630 miles distant, has an an nual trade of $250,000. He had consulted experts and agents of steam and mail ships and he felt that it was destined to become an "Asia tic terminal." He enlarged upon its strategetic importance. He thought that tbe $20,000,000 paid for those islands a small amount if we develop its resources. Supposing that we should build 1500 to 2000 miles of railway at a cost of 75 million of dol lars these figures now seem some what optimistic but be thought that our trade with the Orient had increased since we have become pro minent in these possessions. He con- siders that Aguinaldo ha9 some exe cutive ability but lacks stability of character. lie advocates permanent sovereignty over the Philippines. The second lecture is to be given by Prof. Dean C. Worcester of "I be Philippine Commission." He is a native of Vermont and the son of Dr. Ezra Worcester of Thetford, and his lecture will be anticipated with pleasure. A. M. C. December Magazines. A notable feature of the Outlook for December 2d is an article called "Through Filipino Eyes." This is an authorized interview with the President of the Filipino Junta at Hong Kong, obtained by Phelps Whitmarsh, the special representa tive of the Outlook hi the Philippine Islands. It is the first authoritative statment of the official position of the Filipino leaders published in an American newspaper. ($3.00 a year, ineuutioou ompany, iew York.)
