The International Sanitary Conference, fir which in 1879 Congress made provision, assembled iu Washington City early in Jan mry last. Although it reached no specific c inclusion afficciug the future action of the participant powers, the interchange of views proved to be valuable. Attention is called to the operations of the National Bjard of Health, established by act of Congress. The Board Ins render ed substantial service to the counry iu pre venting the introduction of diseases. Attention is called to the Report of the SecreUry of the Treasury, (see our first page), detailing the receipts and expendi tures for tli? fiscal year ending June hist. iue receipts Irom customs alone amount to 1 90,000,000. The Presides t says : The increase of the revenues for LS81 over those of the previous year was $29,352,9011- It is estimated that the receipts during election, it was understood that Col. j towards the education of the illiterate Forney's long and efficient support of class ia the South, who, aftei their him, superadded to his surpassing abili-j emancipation, were invested with the ty, would secure for him a place in the j responsibilities of suffrage.

The Mobile and Ohio Railroad is to be connected with ihe Wabash system. Hitherto its northern terminus has been at Columbus, but it has now extended north to Cairo, the track being built to the Ohio river. It is now about to put on trains, fix time of schedules and make other arrangement, which will make the Wabash system the or!ef of the country, drained bv the Mobile and Ohio. 10.

He concurs iu the Secretary's recommen dation that the act of silver essaags ba re pealed, and that hereafter only so much be coined as shall be necessary to supply the demand; also for the retirement of silver Certificates. Mention is made ot the exchange of several hundred millions of 5 sad 0 percent, bonds which were redeemable the present year, with 3 p.-r cents, Theijj percent, bond are payable at the pleasure of the govern ment, but unless they can be funded at a much lower rate of interests than they now bear, no legislation respecting them is de sirable. The abolition of all internal revenue taxes except those upon tobacco iu its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fer mented Honors, is reonameadad. an 1 the President screes with the Secretary of the freasury that the law imposing a stamp tax upon matches, proprietary articles, playing- cards, cheeks and drafts in iv, with proprie ty, be repealed, and the law also bv which banks au l b inters are assessed upon their SSpttM and deposits. In referenca to the tariff, he says : The tariff laws also need revision, but that a due regard may be paid to the con flicting interests of our citizens, important changes should not be made without caution. If a careful revision cannot be made at this session, a commission, such as was lately approved by the Senate, and is qow reconi tneodod by the Secretary of the Treasury may be appointed. He aio recommends the release of Nation al banks from all taxoi in view of the reduc tion of the rate of interest on the bond deposited by them for circulation. Touching the Star-route thieves, he pledges the utmost rigor of the law in their prosecution. A modification of the present system ol United States courts is recommended to facilitate the dispatch of business. On the subject of National aid for the promotion of education, ihe President says: Narrow gauge railroads a few years ago were unknown in Texas. That State now possesses 900 miles of these roads, is building as many more, and has in prospect innumerable other lines. As Logan has introduced his bill to create an office with a pension for Grant, it would be well to meet it with the common sense rule, "no work, no pay." The Democratic members of the Kentucky Legislature nominated all their candidates before that body in caucus, from Senator down. $560,000 in gold reached New York from Europe.' 00 the 10th. This don't look like driving oid out of the conn The area of the United States, asj shown by a census bulletin, is 3,025,600 square miles, of which 65,600 are water surface. Texas alone has 267,780 square miles, or one-eleventh of the whole domain. Although our system of government does not contemplate that the natiou should pro. vide or support a svstem for the education of our people, no measures calculated to promote the general intelligence and virtue upon which the perpetuity of our institu- sion so greatly depends, have eyer been re garded with indifference by Congress or the Executive. A large portion of the public domain has been from time to time devoted to the promotion of education. There is now a special reason why, by setting apart the proceeds of sales of public lands, or by some other course, the Government should aid ihe work of education. Many who now exercise the right of suffrage are unable to read the ballot which they cast; upon many who had justemerged from a condition of sla very suddenly devolved the responsi bilities of citizenship, Jn that portion of the country most impoverished by war, I nave Deen pleased to learn, from ttie report ot tne commissioner ot aucation, inat there has been lately a commendable increase of interest and effort for their instruction. But all that can be done by local legislation and priyate generosity should be supple mented oy suoh a;u as can be constitution ally afforded bv the National Government. I wouid sueeest that if any fund be dedi cated to this purpose it may be vfisci Jis- tributeU in the d. Herein States, according to the ratio of iiliterary, as by this means those locations which are most in need of such sssjstauce will reach its especial bene fit. The recommendation of the Commissioner of Agriculture for enlarging the capacity of that department for usefulness, is endorsed. On the important subject of the improve ment of the Mississippi, the President says : I advise sn appropriation for such inter State improventsa the wisdom of Congress may deem to be of public importance. The necessity of improving the navigation of the Jltssissipps river justifies a special allusion to that subject. I suggest the adoption of some measure for the removal of the obstruc tions which now impede the navigation of that great avenue of commerce. itude to the friend who had been faith ful to him in all his trials. It was regarded by his party as proof of an infirmity of his nature which shook public confidence La him, and was after wards more signally displayed in a great public emergency. Col. Forney no doubt felt the slight, though he main tained his party fealty until the cul mination of the trouble between the two sections. Meantime, he established the Philadelphia Press, and was elected Secretary of the U. S. Senate. Joining the Douglas wing of the Democratic party, in 1860, he drifted into the Republican party, and issued the Wash ington Chronicle which became the organ of the Lincoln administration, and a powerful factor it was in arousing the Northaud concentrating the opinion of that, section in favor of the war. At its close, he was quick to discover the availability of Gen. Grant (who was supposed to have democratic proclivi ties) to the Republican party, aud has tened to appropriate his military prestige to its use as its candidate for the Presi dency. Grant, under the inspiration of Forney, became a willing instrument in the hands of the Republican leaders and was borne into the Presidency in a whirlwind of Northern enthusiasm the Southern States not being permitted to vote in the election. During the Grant regime he sold the Chronicle, but con tinued his connection with the Press, and journeyed in Europe whence he wrote a series of charming aud iustruc live letters to that paper which have been since published iu a book. On his return, he disposed of the Press. This was the mistake of his life. The Press was a powerful ready-made lever in moving and controlling public senti ment. He next entered upon his latest newspaper venture, the Progress, a brilliant Weekly which has been a regular visitor to our table. The last number dated the 10th, lies before us, aud like its predecessors, is redolent of the vigor and brilliancy of the genius which has gone out in the darkness of death. Col. Forney was more than a journal- ' ist. Hi! was an orator, a diplomat, a A ' politician, and a scholar. It should lie mentioned that when Gen. Hancock was nominated for the Presidency he return ed to his early love for democratic princi ples, and became an ardent and power ful champion of his election. In many respects he was a model for the profession in which he earned his fame. If there had been a school of journalism, he would have suited admi rably for a professor of the science. Years of hard work on the tread-wheel of his profession, did not impair the en thusiasm of his nature. He was always fresh, bright aud piquant ; but never coarse, nor abusive. Such was the charm of his style that bis long articles did not weary his readers, but he knew how to condense and to express his weightiest arguments in brief para graph. Like many other newspaper men he derogated from his profession by giving to self-seekers service that belong ed to the public and to principle and expended his time and talents the rigorous enforcement of the law against the Star Route conspirators. As we anticipated, he recommends the practical repeal of the law for the coin age of silver in such form as to renew the war upon that measure in the interest of the privileged orders and against the interests of the mass of the people. He carries his opposition to silver to the extreme of concurring in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury for the retirement of silver certificates and supplying their place by the paper of national banks. Ra-Districting the State. The Columbus Index copies our sug gestion that in framing the Congression al Districts a due regard should be had to geographical connection and homoge nuity on the ground that they have which, he had advanced supplies. Thi gave offence to the tenant who murdered him in cold blood. If the murderer has not paid the penalty of his crime, the courts will deal with him.

No pent up Utica contracts the vision of Governor Blackburn, of Kentucky. He takes the right view of a subject of large importance to two-thirds of the producing population of the Union. He insists that Congress appropriate $10, 000,000 a year to the Mississippi and its tributaries, and keep it up till the river shall be made safe and easy chan nels of navigation at all seasons of the year. A measure so manifestly proper ought to command the active efforts of the Senators and Representatives from all the section drained by the great river and its tributaries. ... ia nsuuiacKiruM. emce tile war, his pen has never been idle. Years ago, he was convinced of the importance of bringing the farmers of the Union iuto a representa tive council. After years of labor he has been rewarded by the organization of a Farmers' Coneressof the United Stales, and now the ablest men in the Union are heart ily at work in the same great movement. y . . , -. i t. . t . i. . to say uothing of natural qualification for the place. But little busiiiess has been transacted in either the Senate or the House, this first week. The House adjourned from Tuesday until Friday, and, although the Senate has been iu session, little hasbeeu accomplished besides the introduction of sundry bills. The House is still in the throes of orgsniza tion, and will not be ready for work before the 14th inst. By that time, the committees will be formed, and, maybe the new cabinet appointed. There is a prevalent opinion, in political circles here, that tnis win oe a session in which politics will take a back seat, and in which business will come to tne ironi.

And our Columbus contemporary adds : The policy of "gerrymandering," which has obtained to a very great extent up North and especially with both parties in New York aud Indiana is wrong and suicidal. It was adopted once in this State before the war and the result was injury to the Democratic party. The suc cess of this or that party should not enter into the consideration of the Legislature when it comes to the discharge of its duty in re-districting the State. The truth is, it will be difficult to gerrymander the State with a view to political results taking the figures of the two or three last elections as a basis. The counties that claim to be the banner Democratic counties are negro counties. The Congressional Districts. "Labrfug gratis a- griniers wheel, 1J Hunting liiiijsclf tQ sharpen others' steel.' A few days before his last brief ill ness, he remarked to a friend, "I feel as though I had twenty years of life before me." Within a week his engagements to lecture were all canceled. His ac tive pen was laid aside forever. What a lesson does his death teach of the nothingness of mortality j The Corinth Herald adheres to its suggestion that "the Districts should be laid out with a view to contiguity, con venience and local interests. With one District qn the coast extending across the entire State, then three on the east and three on the west side of the State, neighboring counties would be placed together, and giving railroad conveni ences to all of them better than any other plan that can be devised." Jay Gould &C6., the great eopora tion monopolists, own and dictate the course of three of the large New York Dailies the Tribune, the World aud the Express. Monsieur Villard, of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, owns the N. Y. Journal of Commerce, edited by Carl Schurz. The millions thus invested bythese capitalists who are seek ingto control State and federal legislation in their own interest, is aq acknowlede ment of the power of the press. Jt is to be regretted that an agent so potent for evil as well as for good, should be employed for wrong purposes ; but it illustrates the familiar saying that money can buy what it wants. worth more than a gold dollar, but nobody on that account, assumed that the latter was the standard of value. The honest way to settle with the bond holders to pay them in strict conformi ty to the contract is without reference to the ratio between the two metals. The credit of a nation cannot sutler by car rying out its obligations. - aa. Mr. Pexdleton has introduced a bill in the U. S. Senate providing that the principal officers of each of the execu tive departments may occupy seats on the floor of the Senate and House of Representatives. Such a measure woul facilitate legislation. Ihe Constitution of the Confederate States contaiued a clause that "Congress may by law gran to the principal officer in each of th executive departments a seat on th floor of either house with a privilege o discussing any measures appertaining to his department." This wise provis ion was never put into operation, owing to unfounded apprehensions of en croaehments by the Executive on the Legislative department. A Prayer for Landlords. One of the liturgies put forth by Edward VI. contained "a prayer for landlords," which contained some very plain words The following is a sample : "We heartily pray Thee that they (who possess the grouds, pastures and dwelling places ot tne eartti) may not rack and stretch out the rents of their houses and lands, nor yet take unreasonable fines and incomes after the manner of covetous world lings, but so let them out to others that the inhabitants thereof may both be able to pay tne rents, ana also honestly to live, to nourish their families, and to relieve the poor. Give them grace also that they may be content with that which is sufficient, and not join house to house, nor couple land to land, to the impoverishment of otners, out so behave themselves in letting out tneir tenements, lanas and pastures, that after this life they may be received into everlasting dwelling places. The Chicago Tribune, the leading j Republican paper of t he West, objects j to the President's recommendation to The Philadelphia Times says that two j stoP tne clnage of silver. Ihe Yv est- ern Kepubiicans will be divided on the question. The Western Democrats are solid for continuing the coinage of silver under the existing law. The well posted editor of the Aber deen Examiner says that under the census no apportionment bill can be drawn that will prevent Mississippi from gaining one member of Congress. It would seem, then, that the Legisla ture c-ouid with propriety re-district the State on the basis of sevea members. It might be better to risk the chances of such a measure, than to hazard the rejection of a member elected by the State-at-large if the Republicans should retain their majority in the House. If seven members streaid not be the number under the new law, the elec tion could then be held as provided in Campbell's Code, section 163. years ago, when the Republicans in Congress could not elect the Clerk, they gave Rainey (colored) a unanimous nomination for the position, but now he is rejected because he is a black man and the place is given to McPherson ; and furthermore, it says that if Rainey lived in Philadelphia he could reach a policeman's star under a reform Demo cratic Mayor, but he can reach a nomi nation in a Republican Congressional caucus only when the nominee is certain to be defeated.

Ik an address on Immigration, at Memphis, Mr. Emil Ljnbnrg who is, interesting himself in that subject, related his experience in planting colo nies in the northwest. He thought the South a splendid field for immigrants from Denmark, Sweden, Germany and Belgium. He stated that he expected to settle about 300 Belgians on the line of tbe Memphis and Charleston rail road within the next three months. Senator Garland's bill for a com mission to examine into the subject of tariff, with a view of facilitating legis lation in reference thereto, provides for nine commissioners, namely. three Senators, three Representatives, and three members from civil life, who are to inquire into the relative effects of the tariff upon the industries of the country, upon the consumer and producer, into the relative merits of specific aad ad valorem systems, and what, if any im proper discriminations exist; what changes are necessary, and whether the law can not be simplified. Could not all that formality be dispensed with, and a plain, simple bill be introduced aad passed reducing the tariff open articles of general consumption with a at " view solely fo revenue j aow not to do it seems fo be the order of the day. The Maboners in the Virginia Legisr lat are hare nominated H. H. Riddle? barger, for the United States Senate. Mr. Frelinghuysen, the new Secre tary of State, is an, able man who will command the confidence of the country. He is 64 years old. He has been twice in the United States. He is an im provement on Blaine. word as surrender. He will not stop ptead- iug the cause of Mississippi, upholding her advantages to immigrants aud showing Northern capital how and where it may be profitably employed. Thoroughly conver sant with the efforts of other States in this direction, and to build up new industries, he will show how this can be done here. If his services can be secured, he ought to be elected by the next Legislature, Commis sioner of Immigration and Agriculture. No man who kuows him, and tew of your readers are iguoraut of his history, will question his fitness or doubt his triumphant success, if placed in this responsible position. If elected you wilt see your Agricultural statistics annually collected and published in a form valuable to the legislator and citizen. He would get up a system of crop reports, which would enable us to act with out relying upon New York, for information about the cotton crop, ibe war felt Uol. Hudson, like many of us, poor, but it is well known that he has spent more money than the State in the cause of Agriculture. Most of our citizens remember the interest ing Fairs held in Mississippi before the war. To bring improved agricultural machinery to the knowledge of our people he traveled North and South to get manufacturers to attend our exhibition. To show the interest aroused by his efforts, the first speech he made in Jackson at ,he Fair, the Legislature ordered the printing of nine thousand copies. And I predict that he will make the Farm ers' Congress a success. He will never cease his labors until the farmers of the Union secure the objects and purposes of the organization and this done, their co operation will be given. The victories won by Col. Hudson are easily explained. In the first place he is emphatically a man of labor, plain, affable and unassuming, despising all pomp and parade earnest in every thing devoted to his State he never tails to inspire confidence in all wtio meet mm. buch is the man and such are his claims aud qualifications uneny ana imperrjeuy stated. lor the im portant position for which we seek and urge ins election ny me legislature of the State he has served so ably aud faithfully. His election would be a well-minded recognition of his valuable public services and would be exceedingly gratifying to the citizens of lieuton county, and throughout the State it would be universally indorsed and cor dially approved. Richard H. PahhaM, Michigan City, Miss., Dec. 6th, 1881. view to the legislative policy outlined iu the address of the Speaker, this will no doubt be a busy session. Bills lor refund ing the extended bonds at 3 per ceut. ; for the erection of a suitable building for the National Library ; and for the reclaimation of the malarial swamps about the Capitol will probably be passed. The subjects ot revenue, taxation, tariff, and counting the electoral vote will, doubt less, occupy the attention of Congress, but the conflict of interests aud opinions on these subjects is so great, that i. is doubt ful if any bills cau be passed materially changing the present status.

WASHINGTON NEWS. Commissioner of Immigration. Editors Claeion: Hon. Geo. Torrey, of Jefferson county is a candidate for the above office; and for public information upon a question of great importance to the State ve ask you to publish the following extract trom the circular setting forth his views. Vox Popnr.r. Memphis Avalanche t The President's recommendation to limit silver coinage will please New England and Wall street but will displease the West and South. It is consolatory to know that the President pro poses and Congress disposes. It is believed that justice to the pub lic, as well as economy for the railroads, will necessitate the passage of a law re quiring them to fence their tracks in this State as in many of the other States. For information, we will copy the following extracts from the Revised Statutes of Missouri, of 1879, page 139, section 809 : "Every railroad corporation shall erect and maintain lawful fences, sufficient to prevent eattle, mules and other animals from getting on tbe railroad, and until such fences shall be made and maintained such corpora tion shall be liable for all damages "done bv reason of any horses or other animalsescaping from or coming upon said lands, neids or enclosures. A fence made of posts and wires is a law ful fence, provided it is "sufficient to pre vent horses and all other animals from getting on the railroad." The raiiroaqa, some oi mem at least, mace fences of posts sixteen feet apart with five barbed wires placed so far apart that a 150 pound hog can press through with the ut most c n venience and safety to themselves. It will devolve on the approaching session of the Legislature to elect a Conim issionpr of Immigration aud Agriculture. I will be a candidate for the position. I feel it my duty to give you a synopsis of my views on the subject of immigration. I have made this subject a study for the past ten years. I have spent two years in the Old World during that time, spent a large portion of my nine uiMKiug enquiries amongst the several Steamship Companies, aa to the best plan of procuring immigration to theLSnnth- ern States, The repiy I invariablv ri was "do as all other countries have rlnno ana are stm doing." That is, prepare the proper information in pamphlet form, with accompaning maps with a synopsis 0f the resources of your section of countrv.with all the railroads, navigable streams, the princi pal cities and towns marked out. These pamphlets should be of modest size, on ac count of postage, (which will be a large item in the expense) then these pamphlets should have an advertisement of one or more of tho Steamship Companies, that sail regularly from the Old World to New Orleans, as well as the railroad fare per mile, from New Or leans to the place of destination. This T presume could be easily arrans-ed with t.h several Railroad Companies, by tbe Com missioner, ine rtaiiroaa companies beim as much interested in having the State tled up with producers, as any other class of our population. I am of the opinion that it would be a useless expense to send agents to the Old World, as they would have no influence when abroad. The most successful plan in my opinion would be to apply to the Labor Unions and request them to send out agents oi tueir own selection, me estate paying their expenses out and ietnrn ; these agents while amongst us would be at but Tittle expense. I Know that arrangements could be effected with the several Steamship Companies to bring these agents out and return at naff fare. These agents when they returned to their Unions, and made their report, would have great influence and would do more to turn immigration to tne oum man any agents the State coald send abroad. I am of the opinion that a suitable agent should be at Castle Garden JNew lork, all the time. The Commission. er should be authorized to advertise in some or tneiorinern ana western papers, stating that any person desirous of information as to the great resources of ourState, to apply to the Commissioner at Jackson whq would furnish the desired information. I am of the opinion that it would add greatly to the interest of the gtate to require the Tax Assessors, while assessing to list all the lands in their respective counties that are for sale, as well as all tbe State and Government lands these lands to be en tered in a small book to be filed in the Chancery Clerk's office and a duplicate sent to the Commissioner at Jackson to be filed in nis omce. Should I be present before the Committee on Immigration, I could go much more into aeian, man i can in ancn a communication s this. Geo. Toreey Fayette, Misa, Dec. 5, 1881, Washinonton, December 14th : THE 

SILVER QUESTION. The Western silver meu say President Arthur's polioy with regard to the repeal of the law authorising the coinage of silver and the retirement of the silver certificates will meet with strong opposition in Cou gress, and that they have votes enough against it now to defeat it in either house. 

REPUBLICAN DESIGNS ON THE SOUTH. Both parties are beginning to plan for next year's political canvass. The Republicans believe they have got a hold upon the South at last, aud thev are determined to make special effort in that direction. There are nowhere a num ber of men from the South, some former Democrats, who are picturing to the Repub lican leaders the glorious future of liberal anti-Bourbon movemeuts down there. The Republicans intend to aid every movemen in that section that opposes the Democracy and they count upon getting thirty or forty congressmen from the South next year who will be anti-Democratic. Post Office Vacancies. There are 300 Post Offices vacant, mi the department estimates that there is an average of five applicants for each office. Gen. Hurst, of Mississippi. Gen. H. P.
