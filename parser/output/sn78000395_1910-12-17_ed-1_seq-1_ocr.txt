ONLY LABOR PAPER IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA. VOL. 18. No. 28. Recent Presidential Message Con­ tains Paragraph of Interest to Those Employed in Match Fact­ ories of Zenith City Which Was Dr. J. B. Andrews representing the American association for labor leg­ islation conducted an investigation of match factories in Oshkosh, Wis., and Duluth about two years ago. Accord­ ing to his investigation, Dr. Andrews discovered that the use of phosphorus in the match factories he visited, had serious effect upon the health of employees. His report on the subject has been printed and has created considerable comment throughout the country. The United States government has taken up the matter and as a result. Presi­ dent Taft in his message to congress last week made the following recom­ mendations on the subject: "I invite attention to the very serious injury caused to all those who are engaged in the manu­ facture of phosphorus matches. The diseases incident to this are frightful, and as matches can be made from other materials en­ tirely innocuous, I believe that t-lie injurious manufacture could be discouraged and ought to be discouraged by the imposition of a heavy federal' tax. I re­ commend the adoption of this method of stamping out a very serious abuse." At the convention of the American Federation of Labor held at St. Louis in November, the subject of occupa­ tional diseases was considerably dis­ cussed, after which the following res­ olutions were enacted. WHEREAS, recent investiga­ tions in Europe and America indicate that the suffering and economic loss occasioned by oc­ cupational poisons and diseases can be greatly minimized and in some ca.-so absolutely elim­ inated through labor legisla­ tion requiring strict regard for the health of the workers, and WHEREAS, The American As­ sociation for Labor Legislation has attacked the problem in a scientific way, and with a pre­ sentation of facts and figures is demanding national and state ac­ tion RESOLVED: That the American Federation of Labor urges such investigation of conditions, such labor legislation, such thorough factory and mine inspection, such provision for the health of the of the workers, such enforcement of labor laws as shall place America on a level with the most progressive of nations and it en­ dorses and commends the Ameri­ can Association of Labor Legis­ lation for the work it is doing in this direction. SAY FEEHAN. IJ J. DIST. PRESIDENT WHS RECOMMENDATION BY TAFT RESULT OF DULUTH PROBE $•' Called Forth By Expert's In­ vestigation. As a direct result of an investiga­ tion made in Duluth match factories by an expert some time ago President Taft inserted in his message a re­ commendation that the use of phos­ phorus in the manufacture of that iliuminant necessity be entirely done away with. 

ONCE STRIKEBREAKER PITTSBURG. Pa., Dec. 16.—Fran­ cis Feehan, president of District No. $, United Mine Workers, is under heavy fire here from the Pittsburg Leader and other papers. hat the reason is for the attacks is not known. One of the latest accusations is that of a Cokeburg miner, William Blot nek, whose name appears on an affi­ davit charging Feehan with having been a non-union man and a strike­ breaker in his early days, and the leader of more unsuccessful strikes than any other local labor leader. Blotnek swears that he was ap­ proached by a Feehan man near the Marianna mines of the company man­ aged by David G. Jones, Feehan's brother-in-law, who offered him a position at the plant. He declares that the negotiations that followed proved that a man who wanted any kind of a job at the Jones mines had to receive the indorsement of Fee­ han. He also alleges that another Fee­ han man approached him and offered him a job as district organizer if he would go out and work for the re­ election of Feehan. He refused be­ cause, he says, Feehan was a non­ union, man and strikebreaker before "flopping" to the union ranks in or­ der to hold office in the United Mine Workers at the request of John .Mitchell. Feehan is putting up a fight. He has made a vigorous denial of the various charges against him and de­ clares they have grown out of a con­ spiracy to get him out of office at any cost. Arrest Anti-Diaz Editor. 

MEXICO CITY, Mexico, Dec. 6.— Anti-Diaz newspapers are being sup­ pressed by the government all over the country on the ground that they are advocating sedition on the part of the people and are fomenting disor­ der. The latest editor to be arrested and brought here and placed in prison is Silvester Terrazas, director of the newggaper, El Correo, in Chihualhua, whicTr was closed by order of the government a few days ago. .{5, JIM LAUNDERGAN IS NOW FULL PLEDGED BENEDICT Jim Laundergan, for years a mem­ ber of the Theatrical Stage Employes union and at present general mana ger of the Twin Ports transfer com­ pany of this city, is now hitched in double harness. Jim dropped down to Eau Claire, Wis., an a late train Wed­ nesday evening and Thursday signed up a contract to play second fiddle t.o one of the belles of that town for the rest of his natural life. He is now receiving the congratula­ tions of his many friends who have it all figured out that Jim's head was level when he decided to quit traveling in single harness. Jim says the first thing he does will be to fit up his kitchen with the famous Warren patent feed box and hay rack for which he is agent so as to lighten Mrs. Laundergan's la­ bors in getting his meals. He says he is able to eat marsh hay with a good appetite since going into the transfer business. 

LIBOR OPENS EIGHT ON TUFT-MOON Bill. BIG INTERESTS' PET WASHINGTON. D. C., Dec. 16.— The first authoriative clash between the administration forces and the la­ bor members of the house of repre­ sentatives over the notorious Moon injunction bill, the bill which Pres­ ident Taft has programmed to pass through congress and President Gompers has denounced as a most dangerous underhand blow at labor, occurred when Representative Wil­ son of the United Mine Workers sought to bring his anti-injunction bill, H. R. 2 5188, before, the house as an amendment to a motion by representative Moon. In the speaker's chair was Olm stead, a ready-to-serve Cannon man, who promptly ruled Wilson's motion out of order. "I expected nothing less," said Wilson, "and shall renew the .fight on calendar Wednesday when the rul­ ings of the chair cannot block de­ bate on the floor of the house." Wilson's 'bilr ts not-only /an anti injunction measure, but it also pro­ poses the exemption of labor organ­ izations from the Sherman anti-trust act, as stated in the following language: "In cases arising in the courts of the United States, or coming before said courts, or before any judge or the judges thereof, no agreement between two or more persons con­ cerning the terms or conditions of employment, or the assumption or creation or termination of any rela­ tion between employer and em­ ploye, or concerning any act or thing to be done or not to be done with reference to or involving or growing out of a labor dispute, shall constitute a conspiracy or other civil or crmiinal offense, or be pun­ ished or prosecuted, or damages Re­ covered ,upon as such, unless the act or thing agreed to be done or not to be done would be unlawful if done by a single individual nor shall the entering into or the carrying out of any such agreement be restrained or enjoined unless such act or thing agreed to be done would be subject to be restrained or enjoined under the provisions, limitations, and defini­ tions contained in the first section of this act." Armed with these two legal blud­ geons, the Moon measure, which Taft has pledged the manufacturers he will make law, and the Sherman anti­ trust act, which has been twisted by the judiciary into power to dissolve a labor organization whenever they so desire, the National Association of Manufacturers is preparing to block all future attempts of wage workers to obtain a closed shop. The cloak makers' strike that won this goal in New York and the garment workers that are now struggling foi* it in Chi­ cago have given the manufacturers, who make their millions from the hunger-pangs of women and children forced to work or starve, a mighty shock. These millionairies have called upon Taft for relief and he has promised them aid. GOV 

OFFERS BIG BONUS TO MACHINISTS TO SCAB NEW ORLEANS. La., Dec. 16.—• That the United States government is alarmed over labor conditions in the Panama Canal zone, the result of a strike among the bollermakers and machinists is amply shown by the arrival here of agents from the Isthmus, who are offering high wag­ es for American boiler makers to fill vacancies. Boilers makers are offered 70 cents an hour and free passage to Panama, their wages to begin the day the ship transporting them sails ifrom this port. It is expected that the canal strike will extend to other crafts. GOSSIP WITH BIG BILL. WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.—"Em­ ployers' liability" was the subject of a conference at the White House last Monday between President Taft, William G. Lee and D. L. Chase, of the Brotherhood of Railway Train­ men. They came from Cleveland to talk over legislation for the benefit of railway Workmen. 4. a* $ When Porfirio Diaz, the Mexican czar, took the oath of office as presi­ dent-elect of the Mexican republic Pep. 1 the streets through which his carriage passed was lined with troops with bayonets set and ball cartridges in their rifles. His carriage itself was closely hemmed in by a cordon of cavalry with swords drawn. These precautions were deemed necessary by Diaz to protect his sacred person from attacks during the inaugural ceremonies. Do you think that this will ever become necessary in the United Vigorous Campaign for Minnesota Workers' Interests is Mapped Out at Convention of District Representatives of State Unions Held at Minneapolis Sunday Last. The executive council of the Min­ nesota State Federation of Labor held its regular meeting in Minneapolis last Sunday. Every member of the council was present except Vice President George W. Pippy of Brain erd. A large number of visitors at­ tended, and among them were some of the most prominent men in the labor movement of Minnesota. The reports of the officers from the Ninth congressional district of Min­ nesota including those of President Howley and Secretary-Treasurer Mc Ewen were full of interest. President Howley made an oral re­ port.and told of his work during the past three months. He said he was unable to actively engage in organ­ ization work because of other duties imposed upon him. H£ said that he sent in his place, to northern Minne­ sota, for organization work, John Chubbuck of Minneapolis, who did some splendid work in Crookston. He related an interview had with a con­ tractor from Winona who was having some difficulty with certain unions there. Mr. Howley attended the con­ vention of the American Federation of Labor at St. Louis, representing the Minneapolis Trades aftd Labor council. Vice President N. A. Krueger also reported orally, as he was unable to make a written report because of sickness in his family. He complained that the members of unions in Wi­ nona were not attending meetings very well. He made request for an organizer for a period of from four to six weeks as they needed one very badly down at Winona. Mr. Krueger requested the council to authorize President Howley to visit Winona for two or three days for the purpose of adjusting some existing trouble in the building trades. He further stated that the services of an organizer would not be required until later in the season. The. movement as a whole was in fairly good condition in the First congressional district. Third District Fairly Healthy. Vice President Schilling of the Third congressional district made an exhaustive report on1 industrial con­ ditions, particularly in Red Wing.. He stated that two or three unions were ^falling behind considerably in mem­ bership, but he thought that in a «4 •ir'aCSf*. 4 ,*5.'^:i-'j'V.-j 1 

DEVOTED TO THE INDUSTRIAL OF THE TWIN FOBTS. DULUTH AND SUPERIOR, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1910. Streets Lined With Bayonets to Guard "Popular" President Chosen By "Unanimous" Vote of People Short time the movement would be in No attempt had been made, hesjtid, 1 u', States? It certainly is not neces­ sary now, even when a president is not elected "unanimously" as Diaz claims to have been. The fact is that Diaz is well aware that his "popularity" is only main­ tained by the naked sword and.bared bayonets—by a ruthless, show of arms, by an over-a,wing of cring ihg ^people., His ^cation was brought about by driving'away from the polls all known to be favorable to his op­ ponent Madera. It was this last act of forcing himaelf* em -an unwilling people that precipitated the rebellion now surging through the length and breadth of his czar-ridden, Wall street 

PLAN AGGRESSIVE MOVES AT COUNCIL'S MEETING $ a fairly healthy condition. Vice Presidents Joseph Maiden and F. E. Hoffmann of the Fourth con­ gressional district reported that the unions in St. Paul were in a very healthy condition. They referred to their efforts on behalf of the bakers' union in selling stock for the organ­ ization of a co-operative bakery. Vice Presidents Hall and Hoffman of the Fifth congressional district re­ ported that the labor movement in Minneapolis was in a fair condition. Mr. Hall related his experience in vis­ iting among the unions in the interest of the federation. He also told of his efforts on the state fair committee and asked for the co-operation of the unions in attempting to secure an ap­ propriation from the legislature for the construction of a permanent building for labor on the State Fair grounds. Want Label on Fair Grounds. At this point, S. J. Spencer of the Minneapolis Painters' union was granted the floor. and stated that his organization would not make another exhibit until something was done to Induce the state fair management to employ 'more members of organized labor in the repair and construction of buildings on the fair grounds. President Howley assured Mr. Spen­ cer that he would use his influence with Secretary. Cosgrove to meet the demands of the painters' union. Vice President L. R. Porter of St. Cloud, representing in part the Sixth congressional district, stated that the granite cutters' union of St. Cloud was vitally interested in having the new postoffice building at Minneapo- He also said that the movement was in fairly good condition in St. Cloud, and prospects were bright for the strengthening of the movement there. McDonald Makes Report. Vice President S. S. McDonald of Duluth, wlio represents the Eighth congressional district ojj the execu­ tive council, made an oral report. He said that the unions were quiet in Duluth. that many men were out of work however, he said, some of the trades were very active outside of the building line. An organizer is wanted very badly to enliven the movement in Duluth. Several unions do not af­ filiate with the Trades and Labor- as­ sembly. An active campaign is be­ ing waged urging them to get in line. If. an organizer can be obtained the local trades assembly will do all in Its power to make the work both pleasant and easy for him. He said that they hoped to organize the sta­ tionary firemen very soon, and that the other unions were keeping ti[p very well. stricken land. A satisfied people do not revolt No one is satisfied with Diaz's. rule but a handful of desperate and con­ scienceless sycophants with' whom he has surrounded himself-^that is if you leave -out of: the question the present administration at Washington and the money barons of the U. 'S. who ha-ve found him a. wiilipg tool and pliant to their scheme for en­ richment at the" expense', of the tax burdened Mexican populace. lis constructed^wlth Minnesota stone, leather workers union which has just emerged from a long, strenuow gtrike is badly shattered, but this is due as much to the dullness of trade as to the effects of the strike. The leather workers hope to be able to hold their charter until spring, when it is ex­ pected they will be in better shape. Then, too, Diaz is an ardent hater of labor unions—ardent enoiiigli to' make him especially esteemed by King Morgan and Taft, his man to reduce wages, although it was learned that under non-union shop conditions, the wages of some of the painters had been cut. During the last political campaign union labor worked quietly, but effectively,' to help elect H. W. Cheadle to the state senate. Mr. McDonald stated that Mr. Cheadle was very friendly to labor legislation. He wanted the rail­ road labor organizations at Two Har­ bors given proper credit for their very effective work in the last polit­ ical campaign. Fargo Unions Gain Ground. Vice President Frazer of the Ninth congressional district, who also rep­ resents a portion of the unions in North Dakota, stated that the unions of Fargo were able to keep in line,' but that the movement in the interior of North Dakota was in very poor condition.. Some of the unions, in Fargo have been gaining ground steadily. The carpenters now have a membership of 200. The painters' union which had eight members one year ago, now enjoys a membership of 75. The carpenters of Fargo had raised their initiation fee to keep out inferior workmen. An effort was being made to or­ ganize the laundry workers and the sheet metal workers. The latter are particularly desirous of an organiza­ tion because many of them, when doing work in the country, are obliged to labor from 12 to 14 hours a day. One of the features of the Trades and Labor assembly at Fargo was the work of the standing committee, which regularly visits local unions drilling them in their work. The Sec'y-Treae. McEwen Reports. Secretary-Treasurer McEwen sub­ mitted a lengthy report dwelling on the financial condition of the feder­ ation. He urged the members of the council to visit all of the delinquent unions iri the cities they represent and endeavor to have them get in good standing, as money will be very badly needed to conduct work in the coming session of the legislature, air. McEwen paid a tribute to the work of Organizer John Chubbuck. Applications for an organizer were received from the paper makers' union at International Fails and from the Duluth trades assembly. He urged the council to exert all its en­ ergy and resources towards building Continued on Page 8.
