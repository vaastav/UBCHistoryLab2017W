Tin : contest in the California legisla ture over the election of a United States senator is expected to bo decidedly hot. It will bo a battle of millionaires. Mr. Hearst , who is tilling a vacancy by ap pointment of the governor , desires elec tion.

The message of the president will dis appoint those democrats who hoped or expected that he would avail h'msclf ' of the opportunity to conciliate the party by such a modification of views and rec ommendations regarding the lending policies of the administration as might mitigate the hostility , if it did not fully satisfy , the factions in avowed opposi tion to thee policies. It cannot bo known how much personal effort has been brought to beat upon the president to in duce him to take such a cour. c , in order that party disaffection , now marked nnd widespread , might bo remedied , and harmony cstablisnisd nnd maintained , but ho has had abundant counsel and suggestion in this direction from the dem ocratic press , with warnings that n failure to heed the advice would inevita bly prove disastrous to his own mul the party's political future Ever since the November elections the New York 6 ) i nnd World , the Louisville Courier-Jour' nnl , the St. Louis Jicjntblican , anil other loss potential exponents of democratic opinion , have been tendering the presi dent Instruction as to his duty hi the in terest of the party , not always omitting a pungent arraignment of the course ho has thus far pursued. It is possible that much of this counsel and criticism failed to reach the atten tion of the president , but in uny event the messageis evidence that It has not ,110011 heeded. * Mr. Cleveland stands firmly on the lines which lie marked out in his first mossngo , and which created factional opposition to his administration ami threw the party into disorder. He has abandoned nothing and made no concession to any clement. On the sub ject of tariff revision ho speaks with even greater earnestness than belorc , as might liiu'o been expected from n fuller and more comprehensive acquaintance with the'subject. . The year of study which the president has devoted lo this ques tion has given him a clearer perception of the injustice which tlio great body of the pcoplo Miller from tlio burden of tax ation imposed oy tlio present tariff sys tem , and he tnorcforo states his views of the situation and its demands with greater elaboration , clearness and force than before. Ho is no less firm in main taining his position respecting the com pulsory coinage of silver , though his reference lothis subject is much less ex tended than ti year ago and the reasons he gives for his faith not more impres- sivo. There have been changes in the relative position of silver within the past few months that have done much to confound the theories of the anti-ail v..1 ! ! clement. Regarding civil service reform the president holds out nc hope to tlio opposition that this will nol continue lo bo the pet policy of his ad ministration. Ho avows unshaken faitli in the necessity and usefulness of the re' form , and believes its maintenance essential lo the safety and success ol American institutions , invoking for it the support of congress. Thus with regard to those chief qucs lions of political policy the president occupies the same relation to hia party in congress that he held throughout tlio lasl Rcssion. Haying declined to offer uny terms for conciliating and uniting the party , the question is will the partj fro to the president ? Will Air. Randal ; and his faction abandon their opposition to a revision of the tariff in the direction pointed out by the president , and which Carlisle and Morrison have promised tc again attempt ? Will tiie western anil southern democrats , for the sake of parti peace , yield to tlio eastern demand foi the sacrifice of silver coinage ? Will the nearly entire democratic representation which manifested its contempt for the civil service reform policy at tlio last session now stultify itself by acceding tc the rocominonttationsof the president for strengthening this policy ? We believe il to be entirely safe to assume that none ol these things will happen , aud that the result of whatever expression the democrats in congress may make regarding these questions will leave the administration and the representa tives of the party as widely separated as they now are. As to tlio next congress , assuming that Mr. Cleveland will adhere to his present position , of which there can bo no doubt , the chance of reaching a bolter understanding will bo oven less than now. Thus broken and divided , what reasonable hope can the democracy have of success in the next national con test ? The Silver Question. Notwithstanding tlio very positive ex pression of opinion by the president and secretary of the treasury that the cum pulsory coinage of silver should bo dis continued , supported by facts which cer taiuly give weight to their judgment , il is not probable that i any action on lhi. subject is proposed the democratic ma jority in congress adverse to suspension will bo found less strong and determined than at the last session. Tlio friends ol hilvcr have been renssurou by the im < provement that has taken place in its price during the past thrco months , am the favorable premise of a still furthei advance , in view of which they will nol bo disposed now to make any conccs sions. On the contrary it is rather to be expected that their ranks will bo rein forced. Silver has advanced in the London market during the past ninety days nearly 10 percent , due mainly to the > iinprovo < niunt in the exchanges with India , tin exports of that country having been foi fomo time considerably In o\coss of tin imports , causing a demand in London foi silver for settling tho. trade balance. The decline which took placu in silver lusl summer , terminating about the lasl of July , when the silver dollar was worth relatively to gold loss than ? S cents , was duo almost wholly to thosilvoi glut in India , and n- > soon as that begun to bu relieved a roco\ cry of the price ol bilyoreoinmeiicud. India ia the worldV rcroptnulo tor silver , and as the craj ; prospects of thai country are highly fa- vorablu and expoits continue large , there is pruinuu tli.U ludi t will continue for .1 time to absorb its favorite coin , with the probable cftVt uf further udranolrg its intrlii-iio value. Tlio fact that tin French go-vrnm .it has of late com menced to buy aihur , ostensibly for sliip uionttoTuuiatln. , in < l that ( Jonnuny i ; coining on coutiaJt with thu Egyptian government for circulation.In Egypt , are other inlluciiou. * helping thu improve- mcut England also has shown a more friendly disposition toward .silver , am ! still anolhercausu of the ndvancB is the reduced output. With these -favoring conditions the friends of silver will be very sure U > umuitalu their position more firmly than over , and it h entirely safe to asstuuo that the present congress will not suspend the coinage. The relative value of the silver dollar at this time Is 73 cents. Tlic Corporate Tnx Several members of the charter com mittee were surprised lo learn that the railroads centering in Omaha , Lincoln , Grand Island , Beatrice , Hastings , Fre mont , and in fact in nil cities of whatever class hi Nebraska , have for several years pa t paid no city ta\os upon ninety-nine onc-hundrclhs of their properly within the limits ol these corporations. Under what wo believe to bo a faulty construc tion of the revenue law , the right of way and buildings on ri ht of way , including land used for depots , round-houses , shops , elevators , ground leased to niamtfuotttr- ina enterprises and used for houses for workman and private enterprises , arc not listed for city taxation. Like the property of every other cltUcn or private corporation the railroads pay a county tax apportioned by the state board of cqunli/alion and transferred to the books of the county clerk , Hut not one penny of tax upon this immense property goes into the city treasury. Every citizen - zen nnd private corporation pays for police nnd lire protection , for the main tenance of the city administration , for the enforcement of law and the preserva tion of order. The railway monopolies who wore given large donations of land and money because the Improvements lo bo made would "almost pay intorcst in taxes" cooly decline and have declined for several years past lo contribute a dollar in taxes on prop erty wliich represents moro than nine- tenths of their plant within corporate limits. In Omaha alone there arc 700 city lots condemned as flight of way , which arc exempt from local taxation. Small wonder that the members of tlio charter committed were surprised to learn of this novel stale of things. Tliis monumental tax dodging is un precedented. It is wrong in principle and contrary to the federal constitution. It would not hold water a moment after being tested in a fair and impartial court. Auy non-rc idcnt , paying slate , county and city taxes could readily break up Ibis lawless evasion of taxation by the great Nebraska monopo lies by bringing to lest the question of its justice or injustice as a discrimination in favor of citizens of one stito against those of another. There is absolutely no reason in huv or equity w liy the workingmen - men of Omaha should be taxed to sup port the city government while the Union Pacific and Burlington roads shirk upon thu shoulders of others a burden of which they ought to bear a largo portion. We need a reform in the state revenue law which will take away all excuse for the continuance of this outrage upon tax payers. Tlio city assessment must bo made separate and apart from tlic county and. every dollar's worth of property sub ject to taxation , belonging to iho rail roads as well as to private citizens must go on the lists. What arc the Union Pacific nnd the Burlington roads doing for Omaha that we sbuiild present them with receipted tax bills free of cost , year by year , and put our hands down in our pockols to make up the difference. uml Ucncllts. Moro than 200 rfuits brought against tlio city for grade damages are pending in our courts. ThU is largely duo to our method of appraising. In other cities , specific damages and benefits arc as sessed on eacli lot affected by grade changes , and the results are published in the official paper for several weeks be fore final action is taken in the matter by the city council. Property owners arc in this way given n chauec to know exactly how the change of grade will affect their lots , what the benefits will bo in tlio view of disinterested parties , nnd how such benefits will offset resulting daru- ngcs. In Omaha the steady rise in realty values has caused tlio im pression to prevail in some quar ters that no project of general pub lic improvement can seriously damage specific individual interests. The cases so far brought in the courts have resulted favorably to the opinion of these who hold this view. Benefits havo.uniformly been held as offsetting all damages , and the rise of property along the line of im provement , which has often taken place in spite of the improvement itself , has been used to confirm the arguments of the city attorney. But let us suppose that there should bo a heavy fall in real estate values between the time of enter ing a suit for grade damages and tlio day upon which it is sot for trial. In such a case the argument which is now used as the mainstay of the defense in cases of this class brought against the city would bo turned with crushing force asainst these who now depend upon it lo fortify their position. As n general proposition , public im provements arc of individual benefit. But there is a line where thu general benefit is secured at heavy expense and resulting loss to individual property owners. The means now adopted in Omaha lo ascer tain where that line begins and ends are totally inadequate for the purpose. Tlio council should advertise in advance what street they propose lo improve and to what extent the improvement is projected. Appraisers should bu compelled to assess benefits and damages on each lot affected and the result of their appraisement should then bo published tor the informa tion of these most interested. After ample time had boon givun to appeal from the verdict of tlio appraisers , the city could determine whether thu pro posed improvement was practicable. Time and money would bo saved by this clmngo and method. The Iluslitnss hltuntlon. Business throughout the country is ex periencing the usual advance consequent upon the approach of the holidays. This is especially the case with retailers. In the wholesale departments transactions are , In many instances , on n dooteasing scale , owing lo the huencss ot the sea son. During tlio balance of the year job- bcis of manufactured goods will gener ally curtail purchases s much as ppssiblo , with a yiow to tlio reduction of stocks for inventorying at the close of tlio year , The condition of supplies and the pros pects for trade in most branches are favorable vorablo for the maintenance of firm prices for some time to come , and as a rule * a good feeling purvadus the markets. The failures throughout the United Stales and Canada for last week were 913 , as against SIO the previous week I'or ilio first tiiiui In many weeks the force of legitimate demand has been sut- liclcut to overcome thu bearish iutluunces at work In the wheat market , and , com bined with the covcriiig of shorts and good speculative 'buying , has caused a sharp advance in ( Jilces. All markets are 3 to Hi cents per busflcl higher than they were n week ago [ The "boom" wns started by the curtailment of receipts on account of the late > terms in the north west and the further reduction of visible stocks by the destruction of 750,000 bush els at the tire in Dululh Hut the main clement of strength in the situation has boon the marked improvement in the for eign demand that IJcgan n week ago Mon day , when upwards * of 700,000 bushels were purchased in : ( Atlantic coast mar kets for export. Since then there has been a good deal of addilioual business done at all port * , and a largo amount of wheat is now under contract for December p.ml January shipment. This movement has been favored by tie ! fact that Euro pean buyers have been heavily "long" of late futures In American markets , and consequently have been able to fill orders at Iho increased cosl , which they have recouped from resales of previously purchased options. The foreign advices of tlio week hnvo been very strong and indicate that the wheat now under con tract for shipment has been bought for actual consumptive requirements , nnd not on speculation. Stocks at chief porls of the United Kingdom are only 15,000,000 , bushels , as against iW.OOO.OOO bushels a year ago , and farmers' deliveries are light. The amount of wheat on passage to the United Kingdom has decreased 1,000,000 , bushels since last week. The exportable surplus of India and Amtialia lias been marketed , nnd the United States are now the chief dependence of tlio importing countries of Kmopc. No l > iuijH' of n Democrat. It will be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle Hum for n democrat to secure an election , to succeed General Van Wyck All assertions lethe the contrary are absurd. Both the senate and the house arc overwhelmingly re publican. No possible contingency could arise which would induce republicans lo desert republican candidates in sufficient numbers to elect a democrat. So far as Senator Van Wyck's republican friends are concerned , we make bold to say that while for Senator Van Wyek first , last and all tlic lime , thev will not be parties to any combination which would drag down republican success \\itli the failure of their own candidate. As republicans , they are for Van Wyck because he is a republican , as well as be cause their republican constituencies de mand his re-election in return for his faithful six years' service on behalf ot this state at Washington. It wili be Cnnrles II. Van Wyck or some other good republican. That may be set down in advance of the joint ses sion. For our part , wo am confident enough of the manhood of the'members elected to the legislature and pledgetl lo rally around thu Van Wyck standard , to feel no fears about the result But what ever the result to ( General Van Wyck's hopes , no democrat will be selected to rattle around in his senatorial brogans. I'p tlio The house began its session well yester day by passing a bill making liberal ap propriation * tou the maintenance ot Ne braska's frontier posts and for the com pletion of Fort Russell in Wyoming. The recent addition of the Eighth infantry to this department has rendered such legis lation urgent. In his annual reporl Oen- cn-1 Sheridan especially referred to Forts Robinson and Niobrara as important posts which it would bo the policy of the war department to upbuild and maintain as large and permanent < rarn ons. Both will doubtless be made regimental posts as soon as accommodations for tlio re quisite number of troops can be provided. As long as Nebraska occupies her present relations to the great Sioux reserve the interests of settlements on tlio border will demand the concentration of troops along our northern boundary. Railroad facili ties are now so full and complete that an entire garrison from Fort Robinson or Fort Niobrara can bo transferred in a few hours'time to any point of strategic in terest , while settlement has poured so rap idly into the sections in which these posls are situated , that the posts can be main tained almost as cheaply as in tlio larger cities from the products of the neighbor ing farms. Mi : . PorPLUTON objects to the muni cipal taxation of railroads on the ground that it would be double taxation. Non sense. Nobody knows bettor than Mr. Poppleton that the exemption of tlio railways from municipal taxation in this state is an imposition upon every other taxpayer , including himself , who is thereby compelled to shoulder tlic whole burden of affording police ami tire pro tection to tlio corporations. and Australia have both been shipping much less wheat this year than in 183,1 , and thu European demand is greater than last year. Those facts allord something of a solid foundation for the improved tone of the wheat markotin tlio United States.

Different Stjlon ol' Advertisements. Brooklyn Eagle "The style of adver tising lias greatly changed within the past few veur , " said a gentleman in "charge of the advertising department of one ot Brooklyn's largest dry goods estab lishments to an Eagle icportur. "An ad vertisement to command attention must be original. The public have tiled of such 'ads' ns 'John .Smith will receive his customers at his old stand,1 or 'Blank A : Blank sell dry goods cheaper than any other house in town. ' The present jrori- cratjon is piogrc sivc , and to attract at tention one must be original. Old fash ioned 'ads' are played out. In former years , even in such big houses as Stew art's , in Now York , the eloik at the but ton counter \yis delegated in his oil' moments to write the advertisements lor the newspapers. Now all is chanced. Every large biiMiie-s hoii'-o has its "sep arate advertising department. Some houses employ as many as two and llirco men to look after their advertising. Sineu tlic pictorial cra/.c lias obtained uch a foothold many firms head their columns with pit'tuies descriptive of tlio goods ot forud lor t-ale. And then Hie ad. must be written so as to attract the eye of the reader. If a firm hns : i quantity ol un derwear to sell , it is folly to say so in the first line. Fir-it get your reader inter ested. Talk about the north pole ; say that il is cold in that region and incident ally mention that winter is coining nnd that underwear at this season is not an inappropriate subject. And then , in a confidential way , tell the reader that your firm has many cases of underwear , pur- cha ed at a bankrupt sale perhaps , which will bo sold at one-halt its value. In tersperse it you like a witty saying lieio and there , but unless you wish to kill your ad. in the first line give prices. Ten years ago prices were never given. Now an ad. commands but little attention un less pieces are attached. ' 'Do you believe in the value of advcr- Using ? " . ' 'Certainly. Wore it not for newspa per advertising and advertising by mail many Brooklyn firms would noc be doing business. When one looks back and notes the difference between newspaper advertising twenty years ago and lo-dny the changes which have taken place are marvelous. How many fortunes have been made by booming an inferior patent medicine ? Newspaper advertising is jet in its infancy ami I hope for great things hi the future. " Calculating tlio Slzoof tlio n.irtti. Popular Science Monthly : The earlier attempts at calculating thu sixo of the globe wore based on astronomical obser vations. It would bo dilllcult lo-dny to say within what degree of accuracy'thu figures ( lion obtained could have been rolled upon , us the units of measurement used by those pioncor.s havu been lost , aud could not have been compared with the units now in uso. One of the earlier attempts at obtain ing the actual length of the earth's meri dian bv actual measurement of a portion of HID same was made in the sixteenth century by a French doctor. The means employed , although very ingenious , would' bo considered porfcclly clumsy and miMlequato by the modern scientist. There wns in this early measurement no attempt at mathematical precision as un derstood in the present century , nnd , considering the simplicity of the method employed hi' tlio doctor , it is only to bo wondeiod that no greater error was obtained in its final result.

"House bill nuiubei live thousand nine hundred and sixty- eight. " He penned hta Thatik < .glvilijj proclamation. Many of the letters whicli other presidents turned over to thoii sccrelarlcs are answered by him in per son. He oven addressed with his own hand the envelope which informed Dis Irict Attorney Boiiton of his tcinstale munt. In personally writing his message' President Cleveland dillers fiom any ol his predecessors. Lincoln wrote com paratively little of his messages , but he paid close attention to the phruscologv , In tliosu days the "bills'1 and the "its'1 counted. lie wiote a small , even hand , easily read , and his manuscript was not often maned by erasures. Johnson who followed him , wiotc still less. His right arm was crippled and he could not raise it to his head. He used pen and ink but rarcly.findtng a lead-pencil le.ss tiresome. It is said that lie did not write n letter in ink after ho becameptcsidenl. He sisncd his name frequently , of course , but an entire letter in his handwriting is now worth almost its weight in gold. Ho dictated Ins messages to Colonel Willinni G. Moore , who was then his privnlo .sec- ictaiy. Ho thought quickly , for tlio im possibility of writhifr developed the taoult.y ol dictation to its highest decree. President Grant scut eight messages lo congress. Tluty were in the main con tributions from his cabinet oflicers , written in the first person , and ihen dove-tailed together. " Thi'.y were not dually submitted , however , Without care- iul consideration. Grant was cautious and conservative , and carefully modified and revised the recommendations of hi- , cabinet ollicers. He loved lo uiitc , and all the additions and emendations of the messages vvcie in his own hand writing He wrote many autograph letters , and his vetoes wore also in his own hand writing. He could dictate , but not easily , and whenever he wanted to be pr.rticu- larly forcible ho shut .himself up in his room , and , frco Iroiti inllurruplion , wioto out in full what lie desired to say. Mr. Haves wrote a sprawl , irregular hand , haul to read by those who were unacciistonipd to il. His mctsages wcru largely the work of Air. Kudgers , his pri- % ale secretary , a man of considerable scholarship. Whatever polish thi-.v con tained was due entirely to Mr. Hndgors , and many portions , indeed , were written by the latter in Uie first instance. The cabinet ollicers aideil largely in the work and their contributions wore used with out revision. President Arthur's hand writing was bold and large , showing considerable force , and the words and letters were joined in an easy , running style , as if the writer had done consider able cl"ricai duty. Surrogate Kollins of New York , it is not generally knownwas Mr. Arthur's right-hand man in the pre paration of the messages. Together tho.v arranged the topics to bu tiented upon and many of thu ideas contained in the documents ema nated directly from Mr. Hollins. Informer days the messages wmo du plicated on manifald paper , nnd when the private sccietary was supposed to have readied the capitol for there was no lulcgiaph or telephone connection with thu white house then copies were distributed to Iho various correspondents and roporte.rs. Then there was a grnnd rush for the telegraph nnd the newspaper ollices. "I have seen them nearly bicak their necks in getting down .stairs , " fi.iid a veteran employe of the white house , in describing tlio scene. Many of the news paper men did not hesitate to go through the lower and private part of the build ing , and make short cuts to Pennsylva nia avenue , through the grounds. Others , who had carriages and the fleetest horses the city could afford standing at the front en tranec.raceu down the avetiuu at a speed tar beyond Iho limits of the law. At the novvspnpor ollices an extra force , of com positors hurried the message into type , The public entered into thu spirit of riv alry nnd largo crowds mil-rounded the offices , all reaily to cheer the first news boy who appeared witli a bundle of pa pers under his arm. Nowadays it is different. The persons who in thesu peaceful times , lake even sufllcicnt inter est in a message to slriigta thiotigh Its long array of commonplace sentences , nro in n large minority. A president's message has always been regarded as the mosfc important piece of news a correspondent can secure. In the day.s of fluctuation in gold it had Its value to Wall street also.
