President Theodore Roosevelt's mes sage to Congress is before the nation and ia being scanned in all place by all manner of citizens and with all manner of estimates; some for. others against, and still others ambiguous, rwith many, stolidly indifferent to its text anJ import. The document is very comprehensive and touches upon practically all the live issues of the day that need mora or less handling by the law-makers of the land. The key-note of it all is "Governmental oversight, and increased Governmental responsibility." And this note is struck in full accord with national thought The people are tired of the domination of corpora tie power and influence in every element of their daily life and are becoming restive; though the spirit of revolt is, as yet, subjective to the still possible cures that lie in the orderly province of the law- Nor is this de duction so very radical when one fathoms the depths to which the corporations of .the country have forced the free busi ness, and the freer people, by the sheer weight of conspiracy, and an inspired favoritism within the inner; circle of the law itself. Corruption, and the ar Togance of huge successes, have made vast inroads on the level principles that once prevailed in the American world of business, until they have been set aside as too slow and cumbrous for the "get-rich-quick" impulses of the day; and it ia to this spirit the tone of the mes sage ia addressed throughout its un usual length. We know the temper of the people and the people know their own power; and it were well if Congress hall indicate a conception of the situa tion that shall eventuate in an "over eight" and "responsibility" that shall mean an end to the glaring and daring assumptions of autocratic dominance on the part of the allied-money-rings of the eountry. 

ECONOMY,. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. The country at large has had a long decade' of reckless extravagance, and the "rich man's panic has Intervened to check the wild and vicious course, and to set up the reversionary principle of rational ecenomy in both the public and private budgets of the people every where. It ia an excellent thing for all of us, that the stringency has come, since we have the lesson without the crushing bitterness of a universal "panic"; and may make good use of the hint, still possessing the resources for improvement that otherwise would not have ', been left us. We twill enter the new year of 1908 with a realizing sense of the necessities of the hour and may , plan and prospect our course through its term to an advantage that will measure immensely to our credit as a nation even if its sum of profit shall be greatly less than usual. We have been fixing too exalted a limit on our aims and it is healthful to descend, once in a while, to the com moner levels of equity and sobriety and prudence, and take a new start, Nothing can keep us from ascending again and with an abiding faith in that principle of success, we can afford to step back1 ward to gather impetus for the fresh leap, and make it from a solider and cleaner basis. The doctrine of retrenchment applies to the whole gamut of human affairs and through the private systems as well as the public lines of endeavor and cost; end its benefits are equally universal A WILLING ' WORKER Money is always ready to earn you more money when given the opportu nity, We furnish the opportunity.

There is some talk of shifting the fed eral quarantine headquarters from this city to Fort Stevens in behalf ot ex pedition of the service. This is all right. Astoria will not lose anything by the chance since she will always be the commercial center of the section known as "the mouth of the Columbia river." and if the service will be simplified and the time and expense of ships mtnutlea by suoh a shirt, we shall not complain of the removal. It will still be part and parcel of this port and this city will be virtually the headquarters ot the business and the staff of employe in charge. Ant we are glad to see every nhase of service here, governmental, commercial and industrial, made a di rect and ample and convenient as pos sible, since such arrangements will but contribute to the good name of the port evetywhere, a desideratum of far more consequence than the mere keeping of an office or two and a few employe right in the heart Of the city itself. A Democratic paper, the Brooklyn Eagle, puts the case in this fashion Mr. Bryan has twice tried tfor the oresidency,- with the incidental result of passing from poverty to wealth, and he would now try for nomination for a third time. The Democratic party has become poorer as Mr. Bryan has become richer, and that party is again asked further to enrich him anJ still further impoverish itseif." Democratic testimonials like this are multiplying and getting hotter. A little pamphlet containing a syn opsis of the new state primary law in Missouri has been issued by the McKin- lev-Roosevelt Club of S. Joseph. It is a timely publication. The information given in popular form will be increas ingly in demand among the voters of the tate, who must now rely to a greater extent on their individual political ac tion. The St. Joseph club believes in constant work, and is making an in telligent start in the coming campaign. For that Dull Feeling After Eating.

TO STOP GAMBLERS Gambling Features of Stock Ex change Should be Stopped WILL BRYAN BE NOMINEE? Friends of Silver Tongued Orator Affirm That the Nebraskan Will be and is the Only Logical Candidate for the Nomination. WASHINGTON. D. C. Nov. 4.-Kor cool audacity commend us to .James Creeluianl Formerly a newspaper nuin of no little reputation Mr. Creelman ha become the star attraction of Pearson's Magazine. Always interesting, Mr, Creelman has struck a lead which prom ises to make him positively, dangerous to our "vested! interests,'' probably so called because the typical capitalist is usually represented in a white-vet along with mutton-chop whiskers. Mr. Creel man actually has the nerve to suggest, nay, more, to urge that the gambling features of the New York Stock Ex change be abolished. Shades of Daniel Drew and Jay Gould. The thought I almost impious! It is true that others have secretly entertained the same thought, and here and there a feeble voice has been raised against the tran sactions behind the marble front of the imposing building where the prices of stocks are fixed, but Mr. Creelman tacks up his arrnngment with an inter esting and important array of cold tacts. Starting on the assumption that a part of the railroad and industrial stocks list ed is held by investors, he shows that the gamblers have bought and sold more shares during the past year, many times over, than there were in existence, of th leading "ii-tivr stocks, such as Reading, Union Pacific, Southern Pacific, etc The possession of a comparatively few share in these stocks, which are loaned to those who wih to bear the market, enables the gamblers to raise or depress the price of every share owned by the investing public. This is possible because in every city, in almost every town in the country, there h' a ticket which records the price on he New York Stock Exchange and a place where bets may be made that the next price record ed mill be higher or lower, according to the fancy ofthe speculator. Mr. Creelman finds the difference between a "bucket shop" and a 'broker's office to be that the latter requires a ten per cent dfcposit from his "customers" while the former will take, one, two or three per cent de poita. He finds that the prices of stocks, breadstuffs and cotton are fixed by a small coterie of men who nave no intentions whatever of actually deal ing in the commodities and without in tei-et in f-e welfare of the corporations but who use the certificates merely as counters in the great gamble. Sometime they play their own money but more often that of their customers, being sat isfied with the percentage iwihich they get for placing the bef. Mr. Creelman thinks that if the stock exchange was compelled to incorporate and come 'under the jurisdiction of the State, and if a method could be found to make the pur chases and sales bona fide transactions, the' gambling feature could be elini nated' and the New York Stock Exchange would. return to Its original status us a market place for securities instead of a gigantic gambling institution, Ho points out that one Of the reasons for the fin ancial stringency i., that a billion dol lars is constantly loaned in New York on toik lielil for nwoukitlv mnvose, and that unmlilor are notorious for biln willliiit Co pay txorbltuns rates.

In short, he believed the platform should l con structed for the party and not lor Mr. Bryan.
