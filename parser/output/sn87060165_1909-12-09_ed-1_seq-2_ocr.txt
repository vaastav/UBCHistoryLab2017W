THE PRESIDF.NTS MESSAGE President Taft's first annual mes? sage to the ?OoagrcM of the United States follows clt>tstly ?tbe ?beaten ?path and fails to suggest any new legisla tion not already brought t?> the no? tice of the country by tin? pre? an?! by political parties and organizations The president refers but briefly to the Payne-Aldrich taritf bill, passing "it" by as if in a hurry tt> take up ?noie subject less enrtbarras-sing. though he attempts some little defense of ?the high tariff system in tj-jnrowing the high cost of living, which he tells OS doea not result therefrom. He dep? recates any tariff revision talk M detrimento) to business, but ?this very fact goes to show that even now there is such talk, ?thorttfh the new tariff has hardly ?fone into effect The president, departing from his policy of praising the new tariff law, fails to say one word in praise there? of, but virtually admits that ?Con gress may again have to tackle ?the matter, if the facts obtained ?by ?the new tariff board are not satisfactory. Mr. Taft's words in favor of ex? pedition of litigation will meet with general approval, as will his sugges? tion that Congress modify the rules of procedure in Federal eourts with regard to the issuance of injunctions without notice, though there is little chance that ( ongress will carry out the last suggestion so long as the Aldrich-Cannon regime is continued There is one feature of the mes? sage which deserves serious atten? tion and that is the statements show? ing that expenditures far exceed in? come. In other words the President is forced to make the hu? miliating confession that his party has been extravagant to a point where it is necessary ?to issue bonds to meet the deficit and though he points out that economy is being ob? served in all departments of the gov? ernment there seems little hope that conditions will better themselves for some time to come. Taken h ? whole the message is at least c??n servative. The Virginia Good Roads Associa? tion meets in Richmond for it second annual session this week ?and will be well attended by delegates from all parts of the State. The or? ganization of this ass? ?nation has ac? complished wonders and has resulted in increased interest in the building of roads in every section of Virginia. Its officers rendered valuable aid in the campaign recently closed ?so suc? cessfully in Spotsylvania ?tnd they have done the same in many ? ?ther counties. The association should have the hearty support of the pe<> ple and the press.
