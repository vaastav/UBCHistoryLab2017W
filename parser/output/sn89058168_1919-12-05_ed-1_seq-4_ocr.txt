Billie Sunday, called "the most pop ular preacher in America," will speak for charity in Nashville, on the eve ning of the 15th. The Republicans of Massachusetts, in a meeting 3,500 strong, have de manded ratification of the peace treaty and sent that message to Mc Kellar, of Tennessee, in the Senate. The 33rd Annual Convention of the Tennessee Sunday School Association will be held in Jackson, next Satur day and Sunday, the fith and 7th. The meeting will have an elaborate program. It is conjectured that Newberry, of Michigan, will be retained in the Sen ate, notwithstanding the charges hanging over him . The Republican majority in the Senate is small and they need Newberry in their business. The Republicans of South Dakota have endorsed Major-General Leon ard Wood for President and the Dem ocrats of that state are unanimously for Wilson. The league of nations has been endorsed by the conventions of both parties. Congress convened in its long ses sion last Monday and for the second time since Mr. Wilson has been pres ident his message was read (Tuesday) to Congress.

HAULING I have bought at Auto Truckand am pre pared to do any haul ing on short notice. S. H. ROSS , Telephone 214 Maybe Shields, is. going to 'start some thing" a "free and untram meled" Senate, for instance, and get elected to it by Republican votes, as he got to the Supreme bench in Ten nessee in 1910. Repubicans and anti Wilson Democrats are now saying that "Jonkay is a mighty smart man." Abraham Lincoln said "You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time." That applies to the whole country, but in some communities you can't fool any of the people any of the time after they have had time to "spot" you on your own actions. "Lay down a dollar most anywhere in Nashville and it begins to grow" Nashville Banner. "Lay down a dol lar anywhere in Lawrenceburg and, unless yeu keep both eyes on it, it will disappear.' 'Lawrence News. It is our boast here in Lexington that one can lay down a dollar and get more than its weight in most any kind of merchandise. Henry Clay Frick, multimillionaire, "ironmaster," worth two hundred mil lion dollars, died suddenly in New York City last Tuesday. Frick was a treat art collector, as well as collec tor of dollars, and gave away many millions to educational institutions. Starting as a farm hand, he got into the steel industry and for a time was close to Carnegie, but later he became the implacable enemy of the canny Scot, who had himself dubbed the "Laird of Skibo." His costly art col lections with his home in New York City were left to the public. A French writer says that the So cialists of that country t so nearly bled to death by the Germans in the world war, are openly advocating Bolshe vism, by which Russia is being actu ally rent assunder. The writer says that only a few weeks ago the French were ridiculing this foreign spectre as a distant phantasism with a breath of entente realism would blow away, or at least (and at best) a philosophy which had taken the place of anarch ism; but now it is upon them, not only above ground but adopted as the po litical, almost religious creed of the second largest political party in France. There is no telling what France may yet have to suffer be cause of the infidel government it has had for many years. Rev. W. A. Lampkin and wife will leave this week for Cottage Grove. Henry county, where Bro. Larr.pkin was sent by the Memphis Conference. It may be a far cry from "tobacco to ant." but the editor of the Mem phis News Scimitar made it in one jump not long ago. In the clean-up process in the evolution of mankind, sooner or later the use of tobacco may be frowned upon to the extent of leg islative prohibition and there are various and sundry "dope" drinks, which came long after the use of to bacco, which will preceed it many years into innoccuous desuetude. We can have no millennium until people quit poisoning and doping their bod ies. However, we are much obliged to Cleve Coffman for those two squares of "King Pin" made exclusively for "chaw-in' and spittin.'" There is a row on in the city of Par is, France over the question whether the waiters in the leading cafes shall or shall not wear mustaches. In sev en or eight of the largest eating places the waiters have been ordered to "shave or quit" and the union to which the waiters belong feels outrag ed by the mandate of the employers. There are different opinions about mustaches. Sut Lovingood said such hirsute adornment was to "strain the flies outen a fellow's buttermilk and whisky,"while an ancient proverb says "A kiss without a mustache is like an egg without salt." If the mus tache is adjudged unsanitary, it will have to go in Paris and elsewhere. SARDIS. Lonnie McMurray, younger son of J. T. McMurry, is sick with double pneumonia and the doctors are doubt ful of his recovery. On last Monday night, at the home of W. S. Little, there was a nice and interesting marriage. The contract ing parties were Mr. Grady Mont gomery and Miss Mable Little, Elder T. P. Moore officiating. The groom is now engaged in the automobile busi ness in the town of Decaturville, where they expect to reside. The groom was once mail carrier from Sardis to Lexington, in which posi tion he gave satisfaction. The bride is the elder daughter of Mr. W. S. and Mrs. Armogene Little. We congratu late Mr. Montgomery in securing such a noble girl to accompany him down the journey of life. II in ill in J 111 ft 11 II 1 fli a 111 n id n 'tiS Hooray!

ROSE, Pastor.'' ii ill! i HI J 1 The Grapevine Telegraph has brought the good news that Santa Claus will not skip Lexington this Christmas-and with the message the welcome news that he will again make headquarters in the BROWN BROS.' STORE tor. Ln-i.. t-Zl. St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Santa Claus, or by whatever name he may be designated, says to tell the people of Lexington and surrounding country, that if they will watch the Brown Brothers' Windows and take a peep into the Brown Brothers1 house, they will find for this Christmas some thing to suit all the conditions and ages of life -the old, the young, the middle aged, those who have plenty and those whose means are limited. It is a good idea to buy fairly early for the Holidays, but do not buy till you heve seen the Brown Brotners Christmas goods. It may please you better and save toney. In a recent letter from our niece, Miss Willie Blount, who is teaching in the public schools of Santa Monica, California, she tells us: "Vegetables are very high here this year in pro portion to what they were a year ago. The Japs have control of the vegeta ble market here and have things their own way. They have every one else beaten when it comes to raising veg etables and flowers and everything they put on the market is as clean as can be." Willie is making an efficient teacher as we have long known she would do. MICKIE SAYS cusses; oun kin die an' BEAT CfA OUTEN EL&VEN NEM9' SueSCftlOTlOW N -fEN TVE EOITOQ'U.
