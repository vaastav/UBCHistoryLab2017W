8 TAFT SAYS MERCHANT MARINE IS NATION'S GREAT NEED PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE READ IN CONGRESS Declares the Time Has Arrived to Stop Legislating Against Corporations ISpccud DUpatch to The Call] WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The annual message of President Taft was read today by both branches of congress with every manifestation of indifference. While ot was being read in the senate, Vice President Sherman called Jones of Washington to the chair. It thus happened that he •was the only senator compelled to hear the, message read. Speaker Cannon did not tarry long in the house. He turned over the gavel to a member, and before the session ended half a dozen members had been in the chair. In the senate the ordinary message day galleries were missing. But few persons were in those reserved for the public, while the big double gallery set apart for the families of senators was. entirely empty. The clerks in both branches of congress shared the indifference of the members. In exchanging turns in the senate, one clerk skipped 13 pages*. No senator was paying sufficiently close attention to register a complaint In the house the reading clerks droned through the voluminous document, skipping all of the tabula tions and cutting out the appendix. i *c- Long before the luncheon period arrived a large proportion of the sena tors slipped out of the chamber, while those remaining gathered in_ little groups and discussed their own affairs. 

HALE WATCHES FOR INSURGENTTRICKS Senators Cummins, La Follette, Bristow and Clapp sat over in a corner snd held a progressive conference all to themselves". Not IS senators were on the floor when the clerks completed their grind. Senator Hale remained on guard for the regulars to see that no actual business was transacted when the reading ended. •• Many senators were disinclined to discuss the message, on the plea that they had not. heard it oV read it. Dalzell had no opinion to express, hut Sercno E. Payne, the republican leader, whose tariff bill was' discussed in the \u25a0message said: "It is a carefully prepared document." Ollie James of Kentucky said: "The message is weak and inconsistent on the tariff, and the president's remarks' will do him more harm than anything he has said since he was elected president. Before the election he pronounced the Payne tariff law the best tariff bill ever written; now he admits that some criticism of it is just." 

OPINIONS ON MESSAGE ARE AT VARIANCE Representative Wilson of Pennsylvania, formerly secretary of the United mine workers, is displeased with the president's recommendations for injunc tion legislation. The president entirely overlooks the point. He does not recommend a law that the laboring men want." James' R. Mann of Chicago said: "The message ought to go far toward reuniting republicans. My committee (interstate and foreign commerce)- will probably take up at once legislation needed for the opening of the Panama canal, including the fixing of tolls." "I like it; it is a good message," said Senator Carter, regular republican, whom Montana will replace with a democrat "It is a fine message; I certainly like it. Every recommendation has a tendency in the direction of progress," said Senator William Alden Smith of -j Michigan. ** "With the exception of the ship subsidy, nearly all of the president's recommendations 'are good," said Senator Bristow of Kansas. Salient features of the president's message follow: To the Senate and House of Represent atives: During the last year the foreign re lations of the United States have con tinued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. Arbitration — The year has been no table as witnessing the pacific settle ment of two important international controversies before the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration of the fisheries dis pute between the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspondence sinec the fisheries con vention of 1818. has given an award trhich ls satisfactory to both parties. In view of grave doubts which had been raised as to the constitutionality of The Hague convention for the estab lishment of an international prize court this government proposed in an iden tic circular note aiidres^ed to those powers who had taken part tn the Lon don maritime conference that there is every reason to believe that the inter national prize court will be soon estab lished. Appreciating the enlightened tenden cies of modern times, the congress at us l&Et session passed a law providing for the appointment of a commission of live members to consider the expe diency of utilizing international agen cies for the purpose of limiting "the armaments of the nations of the world "by international agreement. I have, not as yet made appointments •to this commission, because I have in \ited and am awaiting the expressions of foreign governments as to their will ingness to co-operate with us. Several important treaties have been negotiated with Great Britain in the last 12 months. A preliminary diplo matic agreement thas been reached re garding the arbitration of pecuniary claims which each government has against the other. This agreement, xvith the schedules of claims annexed, will, as soon as the schedules are ar ranged, be submitted to the senate for approval. Liberia — The negotiations undertaken dCor the amelioration of the conditions found in I>iberia by the American com tniEslon will result within a short time In practical measures of relief. Turkey — Reference is made by the president to the accession of his majes ty Mehemet V, emperor of the Otto mans, and the desire of the United States to contribute to the larger eco nomic and commercial development due to the new regime in Turkey. Montenegro— The president expresses pleasure in having accorded recognition of the United States to the new king \u25a0dom of Montenegro. It is gratifying to note that the nego tiations for a loan to the Chinese gov ernment for the conetruqtton of the trunk railway were concluded. <• The basis of the .*- . .» America Gets • Square Deal in Loan for Build* ing yew Kail road In China settlement of the terms of this loan was one of exact equality between America. France, Germany and Great Britain in respect to furnishing the loan and supplying materials for the t proposed railways and their future branches. In the Russo-Japanese agreement relating to Manchuria, signed July 4, 1910, thia government was gratified to note an assurance of continual peaceful conditions In that region. The treaty annexing Korea to the empire of Japan marks the final step in a process of control of the ancient' empire by her powerful neighbor. The Japanese government gave the govern ment of the United States assurances of the full protection of the rights of American citizens in Korea, under the changed conditions. The secretary of war has recently visited Japan and China ia connection with his tour to the Philippines and a large delegation of American business men are at present traveling- in China, while Chinese notables have visited this country. This exchange of friend ly visits has had the effect of further strengthening our friendly interna tional relations. Latin -America — The congressional commiesion. together with a special ambassador, were received with the highest honors at the Mexican' centen nial, which left no'doubt of the^nesire of the immediately neighboring repub lic to continuethe mutually beneficial and Intimate relations which I feel sure the two governments will ever cherish. The action of the United States be tween Peru and Ecuador, with the co operation of Brazil and the Argentine republic, has resulted successfully in preventing war. Taft believes Nicaragua will soon take its rightful place among the law abiding and progressive countries of the world, i It gratifies me exceedingly to an nounce that the Argentine republic some months ago placed with Ameri carv manufacturer* a contract for the \u25a0construction of two-, battleships- and certain additional naval equipment- Tariff Xeffotlatloius — In the case of several countries instances of apparent undue descirination against American commerce were found to exist. These discriminations were/removed by ne gotiations. Our foreign trade merits the best support of the gov ernment and the most earnest en deavor of our manufacturers and merchants. Now is the time Plea Made for Establishment of an American Merchant 3la« rine to 6ecure a strong position in this field, as manufacturers are certain soon to become dependent upon it. I can not leave this subject 1 without emphasizing the necessity of such legislation as will make possible and convenient the establishment of Ameri can banks and branches of American banks in foreign countries. Another instrumentality indispens able to the unhampered and natural develpoment of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and commercial nations recognize the im portance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, Jealously foster their merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for rapid and direct mall, passenger and freight communication quite so Urgent as be tween the United States and Latin America. We can secure in no other quarter of. the world such immediate benefits in friendship and commerce as would flow from the establishment of direct lines of communication with the countries of Latin America adequate to meet the requirements of a rapidly increa»ing appreciation of the recipro cal dependence of the countries of the western hemisphere upon each other's products, sympathies and assistance. I alluded to this most important sub ject in my last annual message;, it has often been before you, and I need not recapitulate the\ reasons for its recom mendation. Unless prompt action be taken the. completion of the Panama canal " will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail it self in International maritime business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial intercourse. Quite aside from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant marine where can we find the seafar ing population necessary as a natural naval reserge and where could we find, in case of war, the transports and sub sidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without- a body? For many reasons I cannot too strongly urge upon .the. congress the passage of a measure by mall subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarastee the establishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine, the restoration of the American flag to its ancient place upon the seas. It becomes Incumbent upon me to repeat more emphatically than ever the recommendation that congress shall at once give to the courts of the United States Jurisdiction to punish as a crime the violation of the/ rights of aliens secured by treaty with the United States. . . / The marked Improvement in the con sular service during the four years since the principles of the civil service act were applied to that service in a limited way is already noticeable. The president urges the gradual and annual acquisition. of premises for dip lomatic- use, especially in the capitals of „La tin- American states - and Europe Every effort :has been made Tto re duce the estimated cost of the treasury department- for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 19-12.

The final estimates for the year end ing June" 30, 1912, as they have been sent to the treasury, on November 29 of this year, for the ordinary expenses of the government, including: those for public buildings, rivers and harbors, and the navy building program, amount to $630,494,013. This is $62,9W.587 less than the appropriations for "the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911. It-is $16 883,153 less : than the total estimates.' including supplemental estimates sub mitted to congress by the treasury t for the year 1911, and is $6,574,659 less than the original estimates submitted by the treasury for 1911.

CALL. WEDNESDAY, -DEC^M^ER 7, 191(3 Two Strong Recommendations LACK OF MERCHANT MARINE HALTS DEVELOPMENT All maritime and commercial nations recognize the importance of the merchant marine. The greatest com mercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is the need "for rapid and direct mail, 'passenger and freight communi cation quite so urgent as between the United States and Latin America; Unless prompt actionVbe taken the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great com mercial nation unable to avail Itself in international maritime business of this great contribution to the means 'of the world's commercial intercourse. Quite aside from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant marine, where can we find the seafar ing population necessary as a natural naval reserve, and where could we find, in case of war, the~ trans ports and subsidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without a body? For many reasons lean not too strongly urge upon the congress- the passage of a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee the establishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine, the restoration -of the American flag to its ancient place upon the seas. pended in order to complete the canal as promptly as possible. The estimates for the Panama canal for the ensuing year are more than $56,000,000, an increase of $20,000,000 over the amount appropriated for this year — a difference due to the fact that the estimates for 1912 Include some thing over $19,000,000 for the fortifica tion of the canal. Against the estimated expenditures of $630,494,013, the treasury has esti mated receipts for next year of $680, 000,000, making a probable surplus of ordinary receipts over ordinary ex penditures of about $50,000,000, or, tak ing into account the estimates for the Panama canal, which are $56,920,847. and which ultimately wilK be paid in bonds, It will leave a deficit for the next year of about $7,000,000 if cong ress shall conclude to fortify the canal. The cost of the fortifications is about $19,000,000. Should there be no appropriations this year for fortifica tions then there would be, even In cluJing the Panama canal appropria tion, a surplus of about $12,000,000, according to the treasury estimates. t The auditing sys tem in vogue is as old as the govern ment and the meth-. ods" used are an tiquated. Again, in the col lection of the "reve nues, especially the Changes Advo cated In Reve nue Department Through Reduc of Force customs revenues, a very great im provement has been effected. By the detection of frauds in weighing sugar upward of $3,400,000 have been recov ered from the beneficiaries of the fraud, and an entirely new system 'free from the possibilities of such abuse has heen devised. There would seem to be no reason at ail why the surveyor of the port, who really acts, for the collector, should not be a subordinate of the collector at a less salary and, directly under his control, and there is but little reason for the existence of the naval officer, who is a kind of local auditor. The naval officers in the vari ous ports are presidential appointees, many of them drawing good salaries, and those offices should be abolished or with reduced force made part of the central auditing system. There are entirely too many customs districts and too many customs collect ors. These districts should be con solidated and the collectors in charge of them, who draw good salaries, shoujd be abolished, or treated a* mere branch offices. As an illustration, the cost of col lecting one dollar of revenue at typical small ports, like the port of York, Me., was $50.04. At the port of Annapolis, Md.,.it cost $309.31 to collect one dollar of revenue; at Natchez, $52.76; at Alex andria, Va.. $122.49. It is not essential to the preventing of smuggling that customs districts should be Increased in number. The violation of the customs laws can be quite -as easily prevented, and much more economically, by the revenue cut ter service and by the use of the special agent traveling force of.* the treasury department.. . _\ Very great improvements have been made in respect to the mints and assay offices, and this year's estimate of ex penses is $326,000 less than two years ago. There is an opportunity for fur ther saving' In the abolition of; several mints and assay offices that have now become unnecessary. Public Building* — Some method should be devised for controlling the supply of public buildings. Not 1 only are- build ings appropriated for by congress which are not needed, and buildings left un appropriated for by congreßs which are needed; but when it comes to the actual construction there has been in the past too little study of the building plans and sites with a view to the actual need of the government. v Postofflce buildings have been made monumental structures, and often lo cated far from the convenient and eco nomical spot. It seems to me that the wiser method of preparing a public building bill would be the preparation of a report by a commission of government experts. As the treasury department is the one\ through which the income of the government is col lected and Its ex penditures are dis bursed,- this- seems a proper place to As Income Pro 1 ducing Measure Present Tariff Bill Has jVerer Been Exceeded \u25a0•\u25a0 .\u25a0. . . \u25a0 , ' .' — '—•* consider the operation of the/existing tariff bills, which became a law Aug ust 6. 1909. * As an income producing measure the? existing tariff bill has never been exceeded by any customs bill In the history of the country. The corporation excise tax, propor tioned to the net Income of every, busi ness corporation in the country, has worked well. The tax has-been easily collected. Its prompt payment .indi cates that the incidence of the tax has not been heavy. ';;, • The- Payne Tariff Act — The schedules of the rates^of duty in the Payne. tariff act have been . subjected to , a great deal of criticism, some *of.lt Just, more of it unfounded, and to much .Misrepre sentation. The act was adopted In pur suance of a declaration by: the ; party which is'responsiblve for it that a,cus toms bill should be atarlff for the pro tection' of home Industries, 'the meas ure of the protection to be the differ ence between the cost of producing the imported article abroad and the cost of producing It at J home, „ together; with such addition to ..that difference -as might .give a reasonable profit -< to the home producer. ; The, basis for the crit icism of this tariff is that In respect to a number of the schedules the declared measure was not followed, but a higher difference retained industries and man ufactures. • Little,' if "any, of ' the ' cri ti-" cism- "of - the tariff* has been directed against the protective - principle - above stated;. but:the main body of the criti cism has been based on the charge that the attempt. to conform to the measure of protection was: .not honestly and sincerely adhered to. i Tariff Board-r-The time. in which the tariff was. prepared* undoubtedly- was so short as to make it -impossible: for the congress and its experts to acquire the information ; necessary v ; strictly .to conform, to the declared measure. "With thislin view, the tariff' board. resulted. The board has been 'diligent in prepar ing itself : for the ; necessary, investiga tion. The hope is: that. the question of the rate >. of a - duty ' imposed shall •: be come more* of a business .question .and less of ;a political? question.?-; The '.halt in .business and : the ' shock \to , business, due to I . the; announcement ithat? a- new tariff r bill : is: to -be -prepared." will : be avoided . by ; treating?.the \u25a0? schedules t one ; by i one. -It is not dlkelyithat \u25a0 the board will be able to make a report during the present; session of consress'on*any«of 

TARIFF SHOULD -BE REVISED SCHEDULE AT A TIME As an income producing measure the existing tariff bill has never been exceeded by any customs bill in the history of the country. The schedules of the rates of duty in the Payne tariff act have been subjected to a great deal of critic cism, some of it just, more of it unfounded, and too much \ misrepresentation. The hope is that the^question of the rate of a duty imposed shall become" more of- a business question and less of a political question by the tariff board. The halt in business and the shock to business, due to the an nouncement that a new tariff bill is to be prepared, will be avoided by treating the schedules one by one. It is not likely that the board will be able to make a report during the present session of congress. I am strongly convinced v that we need a perma nent tariff commission, and I do not know that an in crease to five members would be objectionable. . Whether or not the protective policy is* to be con tinued, and the degree of protection to be accorded to our homo industries, are questions which the people must decrae through their chosen representatives. Some of the Points Dwelt Upon in the President's Message Establishment of American banks in foreign countries.

Commission to determine com prehensive policy of army. the schedules; but I hope to_ be able at the opening of the new congress to bring to its attention schedules that may prove to need amendment. I am strongly convinced that we need a permanent tariff commission. It has been-- proposed to : enlarge the- board from three to five. The present num ber is convenient, but I do not. know that an increase of two members would be objectionable. . .Whether or not the protective policy is. to be continued, and the degree of protection to be accorded to 'our home Industries, are questions which the peo ple, must decide through their chosen representatives. fc \u2666 : \u2666"' The 1 general plan - United States Army, Taft Says, Should Be a Skeleton Organization •\u2666-_ ; , _ 1, for an army of the United States at peace "should be that of a skeleton organization with an ".excess of trained officers and thus capable of rapid enlargement by enlistments._to be supplemented in emergency by the na tional militia and a volunteer force.

I have already stated to the congress'that I strongly favor fortification, and I now reiterate this opinion. '\u25a0 . We have built the canal. It is our property/ By convention we have indi cated our desire for, and, Indeed, un dertaken, its universal and equal use. It is also well known that one of the chief objects in the construction of the canal has been to Increase the military effectiveness of bur navy. In event of failure to fortify the canal we should never be absolutely safeguarded against a desperate and irresponsible enemy. Canal Tolls— Another question is that of tolls. This Is all a matter of esti mate, but one of the government com missions in 1900 investigated the ques tion and made a report. In the matter of tolls it was estimated that $1 a net ton would not drive business away from the canal, but that a higher rate would do so.- , Tolls should amount to enough to pay the interest on the investment of $400,000,000. The canal will undoubtedly cheapen the rates of transportation in all freight between the eastern "and western sea boards. • "We have an active competitor in the Suez canal. Then, too. there are other means of crossing the isthmus. On the whole, I should recommend that within certain limits the president be authorized to fix the tolls of the canal and adjust them to what seems to be commercial-necessity. y If the- government, for naval pur poses, is to undertake to furnish con veniences to the navy there would seem to be strong reasons why the govern ment should take-over and include in its ntanagement the furnishing, not only to the navy, but to the public dry dock and repair shop facilities, and the sale of coal, oil and *>ther ship supplies. I can not close this reference to the canal without suggesting as a wise amendment to the interstate commerce law a provision prohibiting interstate commerce railroads from owning -or controlling ships, engaged In the trade through the Panama canal. I believe such, a provision may be needed to save to the people of the United States the benefits of the competition in trade be tween the eastern and western sea boards which this canal will be con structed to secure.

Parcels Post — With respect to the parcels post 1 respectfully recommend its adoption on all rural delivery routes, and that 11 pounds — the inter national limit— be made the limit of carriage In such post, and this with a view to its general extension when the income of the postofflce will permit it and the postal savings bank shall have been fully established. , Navy Department — In the last annual report of the secretary of the navy and in my annual message, attention was called to the new detail of officers in the navy department by which officers °f .fiagr rank were assigned to duty as aids to the secretary In respect to naval operations, personnel. Inspection, and material. I concur in the recom mendation. The secretary recommends that the major general commandant of the marine corps be appointed for a four years* term, and that officers of the adjutant and inspectors' department be detailed from the line. He also asks for legislation to improve the condi tions, now existing in the personnel of the navy, particularly with regard to the age and experience of fla*g officers and captains, and points out that It is essential to the highest efficiency of the navy that the age of our officers be reduced and that flag officers, par ticularly, should gain proper experU ence as flag ofilcers,.in order to enable tljem to properly command fleets. I concur in the secretary's recommenda tion. The estimates of the navy depart ment are $5,000,000 less than the ap propriations for the same purpose last year, and Included in this is the build ing program of the same amount as that submitted for consideration last yea , r j. Jt ls carrying out the plan of building two battleships a year, with a few needed auxiliary vessels. The president concurs in the recommendation of Secretary of the Navy George yon L. Meyer in regard to the abandonment of certain navy yards and increase in effi- Secretary Mey- ; er>s Beport on ; Jiayy Yard Con- : enrred la; Rec ognition for Pc ' \u2666\u25a0 — \u25a0+. ciency of dthers. I unite with the secretary in the recommendation that an appropriation be made to construct a suitable crypt at Annapolis for the custody of the remains of John Paul Jones. The success of our country in arctic exploration should not remain un noticed. The unparalleled achievement of Peary in reaching the north pole, April 6. 1909, has added credit upon his country. I recommend fitting recog nition by congress of the great achieve ment of Robert Edwin Peary. Department of the Interior — The sec retary of the interior recommends a change of the law in respect to the procedure in adjudicating claims for lands, by which appeals can be taken from the decisions of the department to the courts of appeal of the district of Columbia for a judicial considera tion of the rights of the claimant. This would. I think, obviate a good deal of the .litigation that now arises In our western courts. The bill impending. I believe, in the house, and I recommend its enactment. '\u2666?-- Agricultural Lands — There ls no need for radical reform in the methods of disposing of what are really agricul tural lands. Reclamation — The total sum already accumulated in the fund provided by the act for the reclamation of arid lands is about $69,449,058.76. and of this all but $6.24i;058.76 has been allotted to the various projects, of which there are 30. - -. The report made by the board of army engineers,- showing what recla mation projects are worthy of com pletion, will be covered in a separate message shortly. The president groups his specific recommendations on conservation as fol lows: Firsts— That the limitation now im posed upon the ex ecutive which for- Coal Deposits Should Lease for Trems Not Exceeding 50 Tears \u25a0• — :—:: — : : «4 bids His reserving more forest lands in Oregon. "Washington, Idaho. Montant, Colorado and be repealed. • Second— That the coal deposits of the government be leased after adver tisement inviting competitive bids for terms not exceeding 50 years, with a minimum rental and royalties upon these coal mines, to be readjusted every 10 or 12 years, and with condi tions as to maintenance which will secure proper mining and as to as- j tfgnment which will prevent combina tions to monopolize control of the coal in any one district or market. Third — That the law should provide the same separation in respect to gov ernment phosphate lands of surface and mineral rights that now obtains in coal lands. Fourth — That the law should allow a prospector for oil or gas to have the right to proßpect for two years over a certain tract of government land. The period of the leases should not be as long as those of coal, but they should contain similar provisions as to as signment to prevent monopolistic com binations, v Fifth — That water power sites be directly leased by the federal govern ment after advertisement and bidding, with suitable provisions against as signment to yrevent monopolistic com binations. ]- I earnestly" urge upon congress that at this session general conservation legislation of the character indicated be made. I have not thought that the danger of disposing of coal lands in the United States under the present laws In large quantities was so great as to call for their withdrawal, it is reasonably cer tain .that the government will receive the real value of the land. But in respect to oil lands, or phosphate lands, and of gas lands in the United States, and in respect to coal lands in Alaska, I have exercised the full power of with drawal with the hope that the action of. congress would follow promptly and prevent that tying up of the resources of the country. The question of conservation is not a partisan one. i Alaska — The migratory character of the; population of . Alaska and Its un equal distribution make.it altogether impracticable tp give to Alaska the power to elect a legislature. It is far better, for the development of the ter ritory, that it be committed to a com mission to be appointed by the ex ecutive. _ \u25a0i ' : , A law permiting the leasing of gov ernment coal lands in Alaska after public competition and the appoint ment r of a commission for the govern ment* of i the territory, with enabling powers to meet the local needs, will lead to an Improvement in Alaska and the 'development of her resources that is likely to surprise the country. '"•lt, seems to me there ought to . be legislation creating a bureau for their care and control. The' greatest nat ural, wonder of this country and the •\u25a0 — . — ; — \u25a0\u25a0% -• Bureau Should.

I prefer to the Grand can yon of the Colorado. ;. 'PensioiuH-Whlle we should be actu ated; by a benevolent spirit to the sol dier, himself,: care; should be exercised not to .go to, absurd lengths or dis tribute the bounty of the . government to classes of persons who may at this late day. from a mere mercenary mo tive, seek 'to obtain some legal' rela tion with, an old veteran now. totter ing on' the brink-of* the gravjet Department of Agriculture — The re port , of ,; the secretary -<_ of : agriculture shows the agricultural products of tola country amount •in all -to- % 8.926;000.Q0fr for this year. This amount is larger than that of 1909 by $305,00#.000. The existence of such a crop indicates a good prospect for business throughout the country. • Forest Service — I have urged, as I do again, the removal of the limitation upon the power of the executive to re serve other tracts of land in six west ern states in which withdrawal for this purpose is- now forbidden. I recommend suitable legislation to enable the secretary of agriculture to meet the moral obligations of the gov ernment, where forest rangers are in jured or killed -while performing their duty. The Cennun Bureau — The secretary believe, and I concur, that the census will be more thorough and accurata than any census heretofore taken, but it is not perfect. The motive that prompts men- with a false civic pride to Induce the "padding of census re turns in order to increase the popula tion of a particular city, has been strong enough to lead to fraud In re spect to a few cities in this country, and I have directed the attorney gen eral to proceed against those who are responsible for these frauds. Bureau of Corporation* — The com missioner of corporations has found the standing timber of the United States other than the government timber is held in a way which requires serious attention. His Investigation covered an area which contains 80 per cent of the privately owned timber of the country; and report shows that half of the tim ber in this area is owned by 200 in dividuals and corporations: that 14 per cent is owned by three corporations, and that there are other corporations which might lead to a combination for the maintenance of a price that would be very detrimental to the public in terest and would create the necessity of removing all tariff obstacles to the free importations of liynber from other countries. Bureau of Labor — I Invite attention to the very serious injury caused to all. those who are engaged in the manu facture of phosphorus matches. Matches can be made from other ma terials entirely innocuous. I believe that the injurious manufacture oueht to be discouraged by the imposition of a heavy federal tax. The proposed act provides that no la borer or mechanic floing any part of the work contem plated by a contract with the Unlte-I States in the *m- I Eisrht Honr Day! Law Should Bef Enlarged, but I >*ew One >"ot I Necessary I "•" *ploy of the con tractor or any sub contractor shall be required or permitted to work more than eight hours a day in any one- cal endar day. It seems to me that the government has been committed to a policy of en couraging the limitation of th*« day's work to eight hours in all works of construction initiated by itself, and it seems to me illogical to maintain a difference between government work done on government soil and govern ment work done in a private establish ment. Krecommend that instead 'of enact ing the proposed^ bill, the present act be enlarged. Workmen* Compensation — In view of the keen, widespread interest now felt in the United Stat?3 in a system of compensation for in dustrial accidents to supplant our pres ent thoroughly unsatisfactory tvstexn of employer's liability. I recommervi that the international congress on In dustrial insurance be invited to hold its meeting in 1913 in TV&shinsrton. and that an appropriation of $io.OOO be made to cover the necessary expenses. Tlnrenii of Immlcratlon — T.i ft depre cates the proposed enlargement of the buildings and of the force at Ellis islands for the purpose of permitting the examination of more immigrants per day than are now examined. Everything which tends to send the Immigrants west and south into rural life helps the country. The president approves the proposal to increase the fine against the companies for violation of the regulations. Bureatf of Health— .Pr*sMent Taft renews his recommendation for the creation of a bureau of health, to be made in the interest of no particular school of medicine. Imperial Valley Project — I invite the attention of congress to the claim made by the Southern Pacific railroad com pany. I recommend the payment of the claim In a sum found to be just. X>sn"o K-i Position — I also, renew my recommendation that steps be taken looking to the holding of a negro ex position In celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the issuing by Mr Lin coln of the emancipation proclamation. Civil Service Commlxoinn — The "ne cessity for the maintenance of the provisions of the civil service law was never greater than today. Offlpprs responsible for the policy of the admin istration, and their immediate personal assistants or deputies, should not be included within the classified service but in my judgment, public opinion has advanced to^the point where it wouM support a bill providing a secure tenure during efficiency for all purely admin istrative crfflclals. The president advocates a bill pro viding that the executive shall have the power to include in the classified service all local officers under tho treasury department, the department of Justice, the postofflce department, the Interior department and the department of commerce and labor. Civil Service Re tirement — Elimi nating from the service the super annuated can be done in one of two ways, either by straight civil pen sion or some form Adrocates _ Solution for ' Superannuated Employe Problem \u2666- \u0084 or contributory plan. The simplest and most independent solution of the prob lem is a compulsory savings arrange ment, the employe to set aside from his salary a sum sufficient with the help of a liberal rate of interest from the gov ernment to purchase an adequate an nuity for him on retirement, this ac cumulationi to be Inalienably his an.l claimable if he leaves the service be rore reaching- the- retirement age or by his heirs in case of his death. This is the principle upon which th» Glllett bill now pending is drawn. Interstate Commerce Commission Amendments advocated to the inter stats commerce law consist mainly of an appropriation to enable the com mission to advance the valuation of railroads ana fix the responsibilities of public carriers in the Issuance of bills of lading. .Safety Appliance* — The protection of railroad employes from personal Injury Is a, subject of the highest importance ' and demands continuing attention. Some measures ought to be adopted looking to a prevention of accidents from these causes. With respect to boilers a bill might well be drawn re quiring and enforcing by penalty a proper system of Inspection. "I suggest the commission make a special reporf as Jo injuries and the best method of reducing them. - I recommend that a punishment of fine and Imprisonment be imposed upon railroad agents and shippers for fraud or misrepresentation in connection with the issue of bills of lading-. Except as above, I do not recom mend any amendment to the Interstate commerce law as It stands. I do not now recommend any amendment to the anti-trust law. In other words, it ff<f ms .»£' m 5' that tha-«ist!ngp legisla tion with reference to the regulation of corporations and the restraint of theirV business has reached a point where w e ] can, stop for a while and witness the ' effect of the vigorous execution of the laws on the statute books in restraining the abuses which certainly did exist and which, roused the public to demand, reform* . . __ •\u25a0*\u25a0* .__ . «•-.•. .
