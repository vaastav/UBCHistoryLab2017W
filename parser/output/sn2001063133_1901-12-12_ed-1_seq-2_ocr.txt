Emclneer Parleys.. When the train reached Plnevllle, Sheriff Broughton and his posse board ed the train with the prisoner iand were given one of the coaches, which was locked at both ends. At the same time three men, friends of Howard, boarded the engine. They covered Engineer John I^andgan with pistols, and com manded him to back the train to Mid dlesboro, the intention being to rescue Howard where his friends are greatest and where the mountains afforded quick escape. Engineer Landgan, with a pistol pressed against his heart, maintained his composure. He de clared it was impossible for him to back the train as a freight train was closely following and a collision with great loss of life would inevitably re sult. "Drat the freight train," said one of the men. "Back the train to Middlesboro." Engineer Landgan par leyed with the men. He told them he did not Have Chnrge of tlie Train and wbuld only back the train if given a signal to do so by the conductor. Thereupon two of the men got off the engine to compel Conductor Doody to order the train backed. Engineer Landgan told the man who remained and still covered him that it would take all three men to compel the conductor to back the train, as he and the brake man were both armed. The last man left the engine and started for the rear of the train. Engineer Landgan was looking for his chance, arid the moment the third man had'swung clear of the engine and started for the rear of the train he opened the throttle wide and started his heajfy train as rapidly as possible and without waiting for the conduc tor's signal to go ahead.

Manila, Dec. 10.—Native scouts from Benbagon, province of Nueva Eeejo, |iive killed Da.vid Fagln, the American negro deserter fiom the Twenty fourth infantry (colored), who for two years has been leading Filipinos against the Americans. The native scouts decapitated their prisoner. The head, however, was identified as that of Fagin. They recovered his commis sion in the Filipino army. Fagin had on his finger a ring of Frederick Van Alstaetter, of the engineers. Who was captured by Filipinos, supposedly un der the command of Fagin himself Oct. 8, 1900. Fagin has been reported killed on several occasions. The authorities are satisfied that former statements of his death were erroneous and that he has now been killed. A military commission has sentenced the Filipino Gen. Isidore Torres to be hanged, after finding him guilty of or dering the assassination of Corporal Fieldner of the Twelfth infantry at Malolos, province of Bulucan, last Oc tober. The sentence of Hhe commis sion has been disapproved by Gen. Chaffee, who finds that the commis sion had reasonable grounds to doubt whether Gen. Torres personally ordered the assassination of the American sol-' dier. Gen. Chaffee thinks that the high rank held by Torres in the insurgent army would be sufficient to prevent such unmilitary action on his part.

Senator Mc: Comas of Maryland made an extended and carefully prepared speech In the senate yesterday with anarchy as his theme, and was followed by some brief remarks by Mr. Hoar of Massachu setts on the difficulties in the Way of dealing with anarchist assassins. Mr. McComas' remarks showed careful ex amination of the legal authorities. He maintained that congress had full pow under the constitution to enact a law punishing with death any person killing a president or assaulting he president *wlth intent to kill, or aiding, inciting or procuring such an act. He favored rigid provisions in the: immi gration laws for the deportation of alien anarchists.

Senator Hoar's remarks were Interest ing, coming from the venerable chair Man of the judidsi committee, which will have mnch to do with the framing of any legislation on this subject He said that the difficulty wae that assas sins of kings and rulers always gloried in their crimes and were in no wise de terred by the fear of punishment. For this reason he thought it was almost useless to multiply punishments. The most effective remedy he suggested wculd be to have the civilized nations of the world agree upon some desolate spot on the earth's surface to which all anarchists who uphold assassina tion or the overthrow of government should'be transported. In such a com munity the anarchist could carry out his theories of living without a gov ernment and the world would be rid of his presence.
