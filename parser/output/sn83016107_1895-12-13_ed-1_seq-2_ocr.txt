WHAT Tin. DEMOCRATS OP MART" LAND SHOULD DO. Tlie Democrats of Maryland are now in the position of a minority party, the first time for many years. With all the branches of povernment in tlie the ha nils of Republicans, their re sponsibility as to affairs of State ends. For the next two years whatever legis lation is enacted will of course be by the dominant party. There are enough Democrats in both houses to make it intensely disagreeable for the Republicans, should they decide to do it, but the more dignified course would be to let them alone aud run the af fairs of State to suit their own free ■will. If they can improve upon our ad ministration for the past thirty years let them do it, and if by their injudi cious action we are harmed they alone will have to answer for it, and will have to answer to their constituency. The present government to take charge of the State in January was elected by the Republicans, aided by disaffected Democrats, and if any error is made these disaffected Demo crats are alone responsible, for with out their aid l.loyd Lowndes would never have been seated in the guber natorial chair. Maryland is naturally a Democratic State and after having been in that column for years she has now been turned over to the enemy by people who, professing to be good Democrats, voted the straight Republican ticket, now let them take the responsibility for it. 

GIVE VS A STRAIGHT OVT ADMIN ISTRATION. Governor-elect Lowndes has been over run with applications for office for the past few weeks. His determi nation to appoint or hold in office those Democrats who supported him at the polls seems to be well fixed, and his closest friends announce he will stick to this rule. We are, indeed, very sorry to see such action on his part, as it is cer tainly a poor reward for the faithful few who have carried torch-lights and yelled themselves hoarse when there was not a ghost of a show of winning. Now that Maryland has gone Repub lican for the first time since the ne groes have had a vote, the old regulars are to give way for some half and half Democrats, viz : Those who preach Democracy and vote as they please. The Governor-elect no doubt thinks that by this policy he will hereafter have the support of many Democrats, but he must remember there are others, quite so popular, besides Lowndes Democrats, who can cut their tickets also. It can be safely said that over one hundred and six thousand Democrats, now that they are beaten, prefer a straight out Re publican administration to the namby pamby policy the new Gover nor has decided to pursue. CLEVELAND FOR A THIRD TERM. President Cleveland’s boom for a third term has been going th£ rounds for a considerable time, but we have refrained from saying anything, deem ing it best to let matters take their course. That the matter does not re ceive the serious consideration of the American people, goes without saying, not but what his course is one we all feel proud of, regardless of party, and will go down to history as a compeer of Jefferson and Jackson, but our lege* non scripta forbids more than a second term for any President. One of the most popular chief execu tives was President Grant, yet even he when the country was overwhelming Republican could not, after the most strenuous efforts of his friends, secure the nomination for the third term. We do not believe that Mr. Cleve land is making this effort himself. It is only the action of his over zealous friends, and while we always have and always will he an admirer and follow er of this great American statesman, yet we believe it would be suicidal for the party to put him again in nomi nation. —On Tuesday Mr. Barrett, a member of Congress from Massachusetts, who has been for some time trying to bring his name into publicity, introduced a resolution asking for the impeachment of Ambassador Bayard, charging him with being an enemy to the protec tion to American industries. That such charges are ridiculous and that they are brought from the most purile motives, goes without saying. It seems hard that a gentleman of the standing and ability of Mr. Bayard should be subjected to such outra geous attacks from such characters. —Maryland Day was appropriately celebrated at the Atlanta Exposition on Saturday. All the chief digna taries of the State were there, and everybody had a good time. One of the features of the occasion was the turnout of the Fourth and Fifth Regi ments, and Naval Corps and Reserve Corps. It is said it was not once ne cessary for the Governor of Maryland to say to the Governor of Georgia what the Governor of North Carolina said to the Governor of South Caro lina. ♦ ♦ > —The Democrats swept Boston by a handsome majority on Tuesday, re placing Republican rule of the past with a complete Democratic adminis tration headed by Josiah (Juincey for Mayor. This is undoubtedly agenuiue reassertion of Democratic principles in that Republican stronghold. ♦ ♦ —Harry Hayward, the murderer of Miss Catherine Ging, was hung in the jail at Minneapolis on Wednesday. He met his death in the same careless manner which has characterized his life. He was one of the most depreved characters ever known and his execu tion is a good riddance to society. —The election of a State Senator from Carroll county to succeed the late Pinkney J. Bennett is exciting considerable interest throughout the State. On the choice of his successor will depend the political complexion of the next Senate. —The Republican National Conven tion will meet at St. Louis on June 10, 1890, for nominating candidates for President and Vice President. Many are the hearts that are beating in ex pectation in the meantime. Mr. 1. Freeman Rasiu State In surance Commissioner has resigned. The vacancy will be filled by the State Board of Public Works at their meeting on Wednesday. ♦ - —Three of next year’s holidays will fall on Saturday. February 32, May 30 and July 4. It being a leap year, Christmas will fall on Friday. —lnspector Coni in, who has been acting as chief of Police in New York City since Byrnes' retirement, has been made chief of that body. ♦ ♦ • —Dr. H. Y. Satterlee, of New York, has been elected Bishop of the new Protestant Episcopal diocese of Wash ington, D. C. Washington Letter. From our Regular Correspondent. Washington, December 9.—The boldest political combine ever formed in this country is that dominated by Senator Quay, Boss Piatt and Speaker Heed. It is out for everything in sight. Its first victory was the election of the House officers, but it wasn’t satisfied to merely name the men who tilled the named offices of the House; it also insists upon naming every subordinate employed by them. Every day men who were never before seen by the new Clerk, Doorkeeper and Sergeant-at-Arms of the House* present themselves as their subordi nates and are sworn in, after exhibiting the t>. K. of the combine. That combine will also control the make-up of the House Committees, and is working hard to get its grip on the Sen ate committees, but that is more difficult as many influential Republican Senators are bit terly opposed to the combine. It also has an other difficult job on band in its efforts to con trol the Republican National Committee, which meets here to-morrow to name the time and place for holding the Republican National Convention. Although McKinley and R‘*ed are in a deal to prevent Harrison's nomination, that does not prevent McKinley's friends coming here in force to tight the combine’s at tempt to control the National Committee. Of course the ultimate object of the Quay-Platt- Reed combine is the nomination of Reed for President. Much nonsense, some of it utterly idiotic, has been written because President Cleveland was absent from Washington when Lord Salis bury's answer to Secretary Onley’s note of last July, asking whether England intended to ar bitrate its boundry dispute with Venezuela, and ihitiflyiug England that this country would not tolerate the forcible seizure of territory claim ed by Venezuela, arrived. Stripped of all ver biage, here are the tacts : President Cleveland knew the nature of the answer; be also knew that it was useless to send a special message to Congress with that answer until the had its committees, therefore he concluded to spend the time duck hunting instead of waiting in Washington. If anybody is blamed it ought to be Speaker Rtxd for net announcing the House committees. Although every effort is being made to keep it quiet, it is well-known in Washington that there is a bitter tight raging between the two tactions which go to make the forty-two Re publican members of the Senate. Nominally these factions are known as the old and the new Senators aud the apparent object of the light is to obtain proper recognition for the new Senators, but in reality it is a tight between the East and West, the gold and silver Republicans. Up to date the silver men seem to be a little ahead but that assumption is based upon the sincerity of Seuator Chandler, of New Hamp shire, who holds the balance of power in the caucus committee which is making up a list to till the vacancies on Senate Committees and who has been loud in professions of friendship for silver. Threats are being made of a revolt on the part of the silver Senators if they do not get what they think they arc entitled to at the aands of that committee. Should this revolt actually take place. Senator Teller would be the Western candidate for President pro tern, of the Senate. The Democratic Senators have agreed to allow the Republicans to organize the Senate if they can agree among themselves to a sufficient extent to do so. Judge Concoran, of Boston, who is Chairman of the Democratic State Committee ot Massa chusetts, has been spending several days in Washington. He doesn’t regard the Presiden tial tight as already won, by any means. He said : “The election of '96 is a long way off, aud nothing can be determined until the candi dates are named and the issues of the campaign develope. It will not be difficult for the Dem ocratic party to find a strong candidate. We New Englanders do not take the third term talk seriously, but we do believe that the East can and will present some very strong names at the National Convention. To my mind Whitney is a strong man, and Oiney is another. I think that they arc the leading men in the East, but it is difficult at this time to say which is the best to make the race.” A movement is on foot to hold a joint caucus of Democratic Senators and Representatives for the purpose of t rying to harmonize existing differences in Democratic ranks, aud to agree upon some line of policy to be followed in both House and Senate during the present session of Congress. Representative Stallings, of Ala bama, who is one of the leaders of this move ment. says: “There is really only one question regarding which the Democrats arc badly di vided. That is the money question, and if we can reach some satisfactory agreement by which it may be eliminated from our discus sions for the present, there is no reason why we should not get together and present a solid front to the Republicans. I am in favor of free coinage, but 1 do not believe that the dis cussion of that one question can advance the cause of silver now, while its disorganizing ef fect is extremely hurtful to the party and to the South. I would be in favor, if a conference of the whole party in Congress can be arranged, of having a committee appointed to confer with the President and Secretary Carlisle re garding the steps necessary to secure a degree of harmony and establish a policy upon which we can all unite.'’ From ('laymon t. Claymont, Del., Dec. 9. — lt is with renew ed interest your paper is read, from week to week, being intensely newsy and interesting to an old liarford resident, from beginning to end. The glad Christmas tide is rising, ami will soon be at the fiood. It brings joy aud hap piness to all, in a measure, especially to the young. The city stores are at their best, and the windows present a pleasing sight by day and by night. The bright days bring out the crowds, and many are the secret purchases that will be bidden away till the day of days shall come. It Is surely not too early to wish you, dear editor, aud your many readers the compliments of the season. In your last issue you mention the resigna tion of Rev. E. I). Finney. My mind goes back 35 years ago, when I was a live year-old boy on ray father’s knee. He told me of the good man for whom I had been named, and taught me to sing the little hymn which he, the one for whom I had been named, had sent to me. The hymn was printed on card board, in red ink, and at the heading was the picture of a lamb. These were the lirst lines : “There is a happy laud, Far, far away !” And there were other hymns and a pretty pocket knife which he had kindly sent me, besides some books. There were never any hymns so pretty nor a knife so valuable in all the world as those. I well remember the father of Rev. E. D. Finney, a lovely Christian, scholarly old gen tleman, and my father thought he was next to perfection. Doubtless the Rev. E. D. Finney has long since forgotten me, hut I shall never forget him, for whom i have the kindest re gard, aud whose name I bear, selected by the loved ones who have long since passed into the “Happy Land, Far, Far Away,” and yet not so far but that we shall join them there some day, where an eternal Christmas prevails in the presence of Him, without whom we should never have known the blessedness of Christmas joy and gladness. The Addicks divorce case has been decided in his favor. Phis has been the greatest di vorce case ever known in Delaware. Sonic 5.000 pages of testimony were taken, and 100 witnesses examined, some of them coming nearly a thousand miles. The handsome home of the Addicks here was illumed on re ceipt of the decision, and the Hags were Hung to the breeze the following day. It is not generally thought that Mr. Duponi will be sealed as U. S. Senator from Delaware The whole mutter hinges on tin* construction of the Delaware law, which makes It possible for a State Senator to hold the office of Sena tor and Governor at one and the same time. Ir will be remembered that Delaware bus no Lieutenant Governor, and that in the event of the Governor’s death, the Speaker of the Sen ate becomes Governor. When Governor Mar vil died, Speaker Watson assumed the duties of that office, still retaining his prerogatives as a Senator. The outcome is watched with great interest. James M. Phillips, a highly respected citizen of Dublin, was a visitor here last week. Mr. Phillips formerly lived near Claymont, but has seldom been here in the last 40 years. He talked pleasantly and entertainingly of Har ford. Mr. Amos Ely, of Darlington, paid me a pleasant hour’s visit a few days ago. Again wishing you all the happiness and joy of the season, prosperity to soul and body, I am cordially and gratefully your old friend, Osceola. A IV<• I€'<!( Niior of *IM.
