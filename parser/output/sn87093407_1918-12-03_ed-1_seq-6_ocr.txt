Why are those Germain supercriminals being permitted to escape from Germany and the German navy and armies to places of refuge in Holland, Switzerland and neutral countries ? Von Tirpitz, infamous father of unrestricted submarine piracy, by hose order the Lusitania was sent shattered to the bottom of the sea. is the latest of the fugitives. \V ith co-conspirators he has fled to Switzerland. Shorn of his silvery Dundrearys, his pockets bulging with embezzled millions of money intrusted to him by the fallen autocracy from the billions it wrung from the nation it betrayed. Von Tirpitz has followed the example of William le Diahie and sought safety for his pelt on neutral soil. Other German criminals are following suit as fast as they can hag their ill-gotten gold. Holland is filling with these masters in the business of crime. Switzerland is Iving over-run with them. They are dodging into Sweden, Nor way. Denmark and Spain. Why are these men running away from Germany? There are visible at this hour just two plausible e\| planations: 1. Tho situation in Germany and Austria is hourly Up coming more and more dangerous for these men jus dis banded, leaderless soldiers return. Some of these soldiers, reports from Austria say, are forming liandit gangs and taking to the forests and the broken country. They are reverting to savagery. The supercriminals like William le Diable, Tirpitz. Hintze, Capelle and their peers in villainy, see the rising peril of a possible reign of terror in the Fatherland. 2. They see, too, the apparently supine indifference with which the authorities of the entente allies and the I'nited States view the exodus from Germany to neutral lands and the seemingly smug satisfaction of the authorities of the countries whose soil their footsteps pollute. They think themselves safe. International law? Have not these men outraged it? Is it not now to be vindicated? Is there no man. no leader in all the lands and camps of*<he victors big enough, strong and daring enough to go ahead and make a precedent with a rope about its neck? Or are we to leave these thugs to the supposed power* of punishment of their own consciences? Do we not know that there are "consciences seared as with a hot iron"? Are these supercriminals to be permitted to escape the vengeance of their dupes at home, the justice of their victims everywhere abroad, to become a plotting, gangrenous sore on the face of the world, a mockery of all law and the patron saints (save the mark) of every criminal and crim inal class in the world? It is time the world had a reply to the questions on every lip. Snakes If, as the pious believe, everything has a use, then we know also why the snake exists. Possibly the uake's usefulness lies in the ability to teach us the evil traits we should avoid. There are snakes and snakes. Some are poisonous, deadly. Others are harmless, but disgusting withal. Human ■nakes. bitten with jealousy, belong in thin class. This sort of snake is willing to bite his own nose to spite his face. If he's for Tom Mooney, he wants to monopolize the fight for him, and gets bitterly angry because better fighters took up the battle before he got ready. He gets angry anil vexed because it wasn't he who began the fight on rent hogs. He gets jealous and bitter because it wasn't he who launched the campaign against Burleson. He gets himself in a "blue funk" because it wasn't he who led the fight against the vicious legislature of 1915 and against every rotten political combination for a score of years. He gets so darned mad about it that he tries to form a political machine of his own. The poor, poor snake! He grovels in the dirt, turning this way and that, looking for any chance possible to slur his rivals. Unable to hit fairly, he fouls. He lies. He fabricates. He cheats his own conscicnce. Tis not of this breed whence comes great leadership Tis not the snakes of the earth who will liberate the workers and humanity. Wilson "Punch" Missing Tm President \V ilson's message to congress yesterday" lacked the punch. It was expected to lie the greatest speech of his career. It was expected that he would set the pace for the reconstruction period with definite and concrete suggestions. It was expected that he would firmly announce to the world the principles of justice and equity the world should adopt in international relations. His speech, in these respects, has been disappointing. On so important a topic a3 railroad control, he declared himself to be without any confident opinion." He weakly suggests a "modified" private control. The message is not at all like Woodrow Wilson. It hedges and wobbles at a time when the country expected and needed firm and clear statement and action. Weeds All thru the war we've been told to save the little things—the peach stones and the cherry pits and the old scraps of rubber and iron and table leavings and so on. We've been told to save food by utilizing weeds as substitutes as pigweed greens, for example. Now that the war is ended in one phase, this type of counsel is likely to vanish from among us. And it' 'a pity, too. for if we don't eat or otherwise use up our abundant weed crop it will go on causing 41s no end of economic waste in destroying soil fertility and in food crou hindrance. y Weeds might be made into paper if some scientist were to take time to deal with the problem of ways and means. And 111 that event there'd never Ix.' another paper shortage For the weedln omnipresent, ever with us, an offense to the eye and the mind. Be careful! Don't waste a crumb!
