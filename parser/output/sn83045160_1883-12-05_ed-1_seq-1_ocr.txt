But this will not be tho policy o't the Demo cratic party.

Senator Wilson, it is proper to say here, supplemented this civil rights bill by a civil rightsamendment to the Federal constitution. F.dmitnds also introduced a bill for the establishment of postal teleg raphy by the construction of four trunk lines to connect tho several geographical ali visions of the country with 'Washington; these lines to bo completed by June of J.S85; nothing in the nit to be construed sis in any way interfering with individ uals or ."orpoi'iitions carrying on the busi mess f telegraphy, or operating telegraph linH. These three bills havethe makings 'of a great ileal of gas, ami there will no doubt be much of forensic ability expend ed upon them before they are killed or are pawed. ICdiuuiiils has lively times before him, ami his friend Wilson evidently means to share in the f in. Wk devote a great deal of opneo thi turning to the President's Message, which it will be found embraces tho licst points in the reports of the Several departments, together with tho recommendations made by tho -several secretaries, and u careful review of the foreign re Sations of the government. H is a a'ompm-r and business-like document, fnit t'.iero is much in it that not only the f'" niiKTatic but the licpuhlican party will dissent from. Indeed, the bill introduced in the Senate yesterday by Senator Kd iniinds providing for the construction of lour postal telegraph lines, is in tho very teeth of President Arthur's expressed op position to postal telegraphy, and this no doubt will have the consent of a majority of tho members of lmth houses. What Mr. Arthur says alsuit the regulation by Congress of the inter State tratlie by railroads will command attention as a tribute to the sagacity of "Mr. Itejigan, of Texas, w ho for years has pressed this mutter upon the considera tion of Congress with the aid of ;l majority of the Democratic members of both lioiuvM. Tho radical measure the President suggests for the extirpa tion and suppression of polygamy will challenge attention as really the only means left the government to ne-a-omplmh that purpose, and that will doit. As to the taiill bill of tho M of March last, which Arthur does not wish to see repealed or amended, Mr. Carlisle's elec- "tion lei the Speakership of the House is a pUin'answer that it is to give place to one that will distribute the burdens of taxation more equitably and assure the rights of the peoplo as against the monop olists, in whose aid the present taritf bill was passed, llvero are other points in this message withy of notice, but they will be taken up Und treated of from time to time as opportunity shall oiler. Tub election of Mr. Carlisle to the Spcakci-Hhipof the House has called out sis many vuricties f opinion as there are vies on the tariff question. The mos silly and absurd of all these is that it wit affect the business interests of the country (letnmeut illv, and will pave the wav for the defeat of the Democratic party in Is-"!. Mr. Carlisle is a conservative statesman who, in all that ho has ever clfected of legislation, has given proof of his determination for the greatest good of tho greatest number, and he is w ise and prudent enough to reek these results not by ultra or radical measures, but by steady approaches on -utilises of power, so that the economies bf nlie country shall not lie disturbed. Just now ho is, as all true Democrats are, for tariff reform. That d.?s not mean the instantaneous alxilishmcnt of the tariff Jaw, but only its readjustment so as to lighten tho burdens of the peoplo. The payment of the interest on the national debt, the maintenance of the government, costly and much-needed public works, ami the gradual li'piiilatioa of the public debt call for large sums of money, larger sums than can bo raised even by the ex isting tarilff so that a continuance '.of the greany reitueeu internal revenue is a necessity. The most therefore that th most rampant free-trader can exeet from Mr. Carlisle and the present House, is a revision of the taritf that shall, as we have said, give some little relief to the people ami at the same time distribute 'thetariif burden in a more sensible anc fairer way than is the cose under the exist ing law. That is all that can lie done just now, but in doing that the Democratic party can recover much of lost ground and regain much of its historic prestige as tho party of the people and for the peo pie. under the direction of which the Cnited States achieved its greatest glories and expanded aud grew and thrived com' men ially as it never has since upon tho high seas and in its trade with foreign na tive. The JHimocraUc party must be come aggressive to live. It has too long and too tamely submitted insupincnesa to Republican dictation and initia tive. Another four years of such cowardly olicy and its race would end in ignominious disaster and death. The election of Mr. Carlisle means new life and the revival of the latent energies of the party ; it means a vigorous foreign as well as liberal domestic policy, and that this government of the people and for the peoplo shall tie administered not for tha

Mr. Converse said he had been requested by Mr. Manning to ask unanimous consent that the question of hisjiri'i;ia fiwic right to his seat be referred to the Committee on Elections, with instructions to report at the earliest day tiossible. Mr. Keifer asked that the case, of Mr. Chalmers be also referred, and Mr. Con verse put the request in a resolution refer ring to the Committee on Flections all pa jiers in the case, with instructions to report immediately whether on the prima facie case presented either Manning or Chal mers are entitled to lie sworn as menii,, pending the contest on its mer-'j., andVlot to affect the final right & theVat. The resolution was adon. The delegate from the Territor ies a peared at Clt, l,ar of tho House, and were swil in. Mr. Springer offered a resolution to refer to the Committee on Flections, when appointed, the memorial of the memorial of the Governor of Kansas, and others, presented yesterday, and the papers presented to the clerk of the House in regard to tho elation qualifica tions of Peters, of Kansas, w ith instruc tions to report whether Peters was eligible; and if not, whether the con testant, Wood, was entitled to the seat. Adopted. A resolution was adopted providing that the rules of the Forty-seventh Congress be the rules of the Forty-eighth until two weeks from (he appointment of the Com mittee on Pules. The Democratic 'caucus nominees for tho minor offices were elected pid sworn in.. A committee consisting of Messrs. Cnr tin, Blackburn and Hiscock was appointed to wait upon the President and inform him that the House was organized and ready to receive any communication he was pleased to transmit. The business of drawing for seats was proceeded with. Upon the completion of the drawing, Mr. Dunn offered a resolution for the ap pointment of a committee of fifteen mem bers, to be known as the committee to which will bo referred propositions 'or the improvement of rivers and hsiti'ors. Re ferred to the Committee On Pules, when appointed. The Speaker appointed as the Com mitttee on Mileage Messrs. Motilton, Well born, J laseock, Kaney and Miller Fa. Mr. Tucker offered a resolution, which was referrx-d to the Committee on F.lee-tl,,p-i when appointed, the certilieatesand an me papers rv'.ating to the election of the JCepreneutativo from the 1- irst District of Virginia, with instructions to report as early as practicable which of the rival claimants (Mayo and (iarrison) to the seat has a primn fm ie riiht. reserving to the other jiartv the privilege of contesting the case on its merits. At this point the committee to wait upon the President announced that the l resilient would communicate to the House a message in writinir. The President's secretary at 11:05 o'clock p.m. appeared and presented the Presi- lent s message. Consideration of Mr. Tucker's resolu tion was entered upon. Mr. Calkins contended that the urima fnrie right was already settled by the swear- ng oi juavo. The previous question was seconded. Mr. Keifer spoke in otmosition to the resolution, contending that should it be adopted, and (iarrison allowed a prima jm-ic rigiu io me seal, siayo would be de prived of all power of contest. This was a plan by w hich a man already sworn in could lie unseated on a prima fonV ease. and forever deprived of the rights of con lest. The House should hesitate ln-fore It undertook to put any gentleman In that position. .Mr. .lulin S. iso asked his collea.'iie w hether it Wns a iniestion as to w ho Tins the firimu ftn-tr title. Mr, 1 lleker answered yes. Mr. Springer said he understood that Carrison made a contest of the primn fnrie rignt as well as the rnrht on its merits. Now that the House was organized, it w as the judge of everything that pertained to the light of a menilier. Would the House allow a returning-board to usurp the au thority of the Ibmse and disfranchise w hole committees in granting prima facir certillcatcs? If there ever had been an arbitrary exercise of quasi judicial power by a returning-board it was in this ease. Mr. J. S. Wise said the only case from Virginia in which the question of retnrn-ing-lHards entered was the case of Piatt against tioode, when Piatt was elected, hut (iomle was given the seat bv a Demo cratic House. It came with dad grace from the other side to make the statement that frauds by returning-lioards were be coming too common in Virginia. Mr. Mavo declared that the certtlleate which allowed him to be sworn was identi cal with that presented by his colleague, Mr. tucker, llo asked, in common justice, that the House deal with his case fairly, for lie would be sorry to have to say that he belonged to a body of men w ho so far forgot w hat was right as to decide noon a case in advance, merely becauso lie be longed to the minority. .Mr. Calkins appealed to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tucker) not to estab lish a precedent that would endanger every man in his seat. After the clerk of the House had put a man on the roll, and he was sworn in the prima facit right was n atljuatcala. At the suggestion of Mr. Kandall the matter went over until to-morrow, and the reading clerk rend the President's mes sage for message in full, see second page, which was ordered printed and referred to Committee of the hole, after which the House adjourned.

The memo rial presented in the Senate by Senator Coke, relating to the alleged abuses in the I nited States IHstriet Courts of Texas, sets forth that Cnited States Hisliict ndgos of Teas are failing to hold the terms of the courts fixed bv law. Thev are appointing their sous, sons-in-law and brothers-in-law to places as the district and deputy-district clerks of their courts, and keeping them in office, to the great wrong o the p'.ihlic. Among other illus trations of the charges, the memorialist mentions the fact that the Cnited States Histnct indue of the Western district of the State lhas in the last five years held only two terms of tho court, when he should have held six, and for this negli gence there is no gootl cause. IXtULLS'S PENSION KIEL. The Ncuntor from Ksnma I'.arlj- fn the I- lent. Washington, December 4. The bill in troduced by Senator Ingalls to remove cer tain limitations of the nrears ol pensi-ms act provides that "All pensions which have been, or may hereafter be granted in consequence of deatli occurring from mises which originated in the service since March 4, 1S0I, or in consequence of wounds or injuries received or disease ontractcd since that date, shall date from the death or discharge of the erson on whose account the claim ins been or is hereafter "ranted.

HOW ATKINS Wns Dcfr.ilct for Clerk of the Houkc ot I;circtentnll vfa. Special to the Cincinnati Co.nni'Tcini (!a- zclle: It seems that there were not two ballots for clerk, but than when tho roll call was finished, and the tally stood ('lark itl, Atkins ill, Martin ti, friends of Atkins, headed bv no less i person than Randall himself, who left his seat for the purpose, obtained the change of three Martin votes to him, leaving the tallv at Atkins HI.

Ilu-n, while the tellers and clerks were puzzled a Martin vote was changed to Clark, electing him bv Clark '., Atkins !-, Martin 2. It was the one close tight of the caucus, and the length of the ballot and the uncertainty for a time of the result, led to the general idea outside that a tie had occurred, and that two ballots had been taken. As giving an idea of the immensity of the Democratic majority, a leading memlier says: "When 1 entered the chamber 1 for a moment for- ft it was a mere party caucus, and be ieved that Congress was in session on some unusually important business. More seats were occupied than in the case dur ing session, cxcojt on special occasions. A FOOL AM) HIS FOLEY. nilver-BIII rtlnl rnvor n Continual- liun or the oloiine of Silver.

He might consent to tiie extension of their charters iu cases "w here a business stringency is threaten, ",1. but ho is against all proposi tions to help perpetnate the system as a system.

It will be a very dilti iMill, miU, lha lunniici1 of iit'w members is greater than in any preceding Congress for years, and the capacity of the new men is not very well understood. Speculations for the present are mainly confined to chairmanships. It is generally admitted that Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, will be chairman of the Ways and Mans Com mittee, and that he ill be one of Car lisle's chief advisers. Many think that Mr. Morrison will be the most influential factor in tiie organization of the House, and that he would be better pleased to control tho organization in accordance with his own views than to receive a very important place him self. A noted Kand.:!l man says: "Mr. Mor rison will have the control of the organi zation of the House, and will shape it in the interest of his ambition, which is the Presidential nomination." The ranking Democratic member on the ays and .Means Committee wa :ll'kCr The 0M of 'the old committee -r0 vcry ihen m (he "ator tuo new committees.

It is conceded that Mr. Carlisle will not follow Randall's policy, in punishing his eiienlii-s. Mr. Randall wftde Mr. Or cliHiriiirin of the J!oeq!e CcWiiitUe, and Carlisle's fijcn '3 8:u lie will lvwke Randall chairman of Appropriations. The position of Black burn in that event will be embarrassing to Carlisle, as Plackburn ranks on the Appropriations Com wit tee, awl, with irood grace, could hardly be d'sflc'cc liy Kan ";'.l'..

Police patrol the streets leading to the thenar; Plans for Cnrr.vlnsr on the Nationnllatt Agitation A great meeting of the National lieagners of the county of 1-oiidonderry, Ireland, was held iu the chv of Londonderry Saturday. Hie object was that of devis ing methods of carrying on the National ist agitation by a series of public meetings, which may escape the usual prohibitions issued by Dublin Castle against the con ventions" avowedly in tho interest of the league propaganda. It was, alter a long discussion, derided to orgtinfte a coiltinu- ous series of anniversary celebrations of episodes in the Irish resistance to Eng.ish invasion. the sentiment is that the Castle authorities will not prohibit or dis turb these ostensibly patriotic celebra tions, while the very nature of the occa sions will tend to revive the Irish national spirit and make it the more susceptible to league influences. The first of thff new series of meetings will be held on the 18th of the present month, w hich will be the anniversary of one of the most inspiring events in the annals t Irish patriotism. It was on this date, in 18). that some cool-headed apprentice bnvs of London derry, while the citizens of the town were running about iu Wild panic over reports that a general religious massacre had been ordered and was about to be put into ex ecution, noticing the approach of King James's troops under Lord Antrim, drew up the terry gates just as. the besieging soldiers were about to secure their pos session, and thus so eifeetually barred out the enemy that the town was enabled to properly put itself in condition to success fully resist the memorable luo-davs siege. Every arrangement will be made to have tins J'crry celebration as successful as nosRihle. The orations will be delivered by the ablest speakers in the league, and inducements win ue neid out to araw excursionists from all parts of Ireland. Much anxiety is felt by the league leaders as to what policy the gov ernment will adopt toward the pro posed class of meetings. The Derry meet ing will be largely experimental. The leagners assume that as the Derrv resist- aice to King James was mainly Prot estant the Orangemen should not oppose the celebration, but the Orangemen de clare that the new league scheme is merely a false pretense, devised for the purpose of hoodwinking the officials into a tolerance ot a dangerous lorm ot na tional propaganda, and have already threatened to organize connter-celebra- tions for the pnrKse of making riots nn minent,and so inducing the castle to issue the usual prohibitions.

The trial of Charles Ford, charged with complicity in the same robbery, is also set for January 1-lth. Tim interests of humanity seem to de mand the publication of the following facts: Two months ago my attention was called to the case of a poor woman who was said to be atllicted with a cancer. I found her with an ulcer on her shoulder at least five inches in circumference,angry, '.ainful, and giving the patient no rest day or night for six months. I obtained a supply of Swift's Specific, which I per- suaueu ner io iry. one nas uiKen live battles, the result of which is that the ulcer is entirely healed up, nothing re maining but a small scab, not larger than one's finger nail, and her general health is better than for five years past. She seems lierfectly cured. An old man of sixty- seven years had been subjwt to scrofu lous sores live vears. 1 le had one on his cheek as large as a silver dollar, swollen, raw anil constantly exuding very offensive matter, .mother on Jus loot ol the some character, and several on his hands, all of about two and a half vears standing. His general health was poor, and he could scarcely get about at all. He has taken two bottles ol bwift s specific I he sores are all well, leaving scarcely a vestige of their former existence, and his general health belter than it has been in ten years. I consider its effects wonderful almost miraculous. ' REV,
