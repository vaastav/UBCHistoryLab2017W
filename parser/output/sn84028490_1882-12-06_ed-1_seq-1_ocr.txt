The Old, Old Story Repeated—A Wayward Wife and an Injured Husband—History Always Repeats Itself (St. Louis Special to the Chicago Tribune.) What came very near being a fatal tragedy, and is one of the greatest social Mentations ever transpiring in this citv. happened on Tuesday afternoon last, at an aristocratic assignation house on Singleton street known as the "Tink House." At 5 o'clock a gentleman and a lady heavily veiled, who had entered the house three hours previously, left the preuiisep. and were almost ininiedl ately confronted by the lady's husband and a grim-looking detective. The girl clung to her escort's arm, with a short scream, and the husband immediately leveled a pistol and fired. The ball struck the lady's friend in the arm, and had it been an inch higher or lower it would have finished hiiu. As it was, the bones of his arm were shattered and he fell groaning to the pavement. The husband strode over him and leveled the pistol again, evidently intending to fin ish his victim, but the detective wrench ed away his weapon, and the parties separated. The dramatis persons in this tragedy were Mr. and Mrs. Hush 11. Tevis, Mr. Frank Iglehart, and a private detective who was formerly on the po lice force. The story of the affair can be soon told. Mrs. Tevis is a lady well known in St. Louis society. She is a niece of Gen. Sherman, the Commander in-Chief of the army, and also a niece of the late Justice Samuel F. Reber. Her father, Col. Heese, is now In the regular army, but is a: present in St. Louis. The ladv is auite voung. with an exceeding ly attractive and intelligent face, of the order best described as a red blonde, framed by Titianesque hair, and her figure is instinct with grace. She does not look to be more than twenty years of age, and she has been the charming centre of a very origin circle in at, Louis society for several years. About four years ago she was married to Mr. Kush Tevis, at present an employe in the store of Crow, Hargadine & Co., and a son of Mr. John C. Tevis, an old and respected citizen of St. Louis, and a re lative of the California Tevises. Every one who knew them supposed mat the home on Leonard street was a very hap py one. Mrs. Tevis seemed to be thoroughly contented and altogether wrapped up in her baby, now a charm ing, bright little girl of three years. For some time past, however, there has been a coolness between the two. Mrs. Tevis confided to a friend last week that her husband had been very much annoyed by an anonymous letter that he had re ceived a couple of days before, and that he bad been to see the private detective about the matter. She seemed to be very much troubled about it. Tevis, however, appeared to be satisfied, and the matter was dropped. Yesterday afternoon about 2 o'clock Mrs. Tevis met Mr. Frank Igle hart at the "Tank House" by appoint ment. Mr. Iglehart Is a gentleman well known about the city. He was for a long time connected with the banking house of Barthlow, Lewis & Co., as cashier, and is now interested in the new Kehlor Mills, which are soon to be built here. It was while leaving this honse after hoursklalliance that the hus band, who had been waiting for them with rare patience since 2:30, succeed ing in shooting the destroyer of his happiness in the arm. When the shot was- fired Mr. Tevis was taken away by the detective friend, and the lady sup ported Mr. Iglehart westward and nailed a passing carriage. While Iglehart was to be supported the girl was as brave as a lioness. She held him up and did all that lay in a woman's power or wit to soothe the agony of the shattered arm, but once in the carriage she gave way to her natural grief. The full meaning of the ef-clandre tided in upon her, and the heroine of the moment before be came the weak, despairing woman. She seemed to realize suddenly that all worth living for had gone to wreck and ruin about her. A gentleman who was standing at the corner of Fourteenth and Washington avenue and saw the party leaving the hack to enter Mr. Igle hart's residence, describes the scene as tragic in the extreme. The pale lady and the wounded man made a tableau of love, despair and rain, not easy to forget. Almost hysterical, Mrs. Tevis did not know what to do. Her first care was for her lover, and, when be was safely housed, she seemed to abandon herself altogether. She went home to her father and confessed all to him, and and there she is now stopping, and is said to be greatly prostrated. Mr. Igle hart is lying at his boarding place with his shattered, arm bound in a plaster cast, and the surgeon who is attending him says he will probably lose it. He takes the blame of the whole affair upon himself, and intimates that, in the event of the injured husband wanting any more satisfaction,. he will be ready to give it. The tronble between the husband and wife has been settled, the understanding being that Tevis shall sue for a divorce, and that the wife shall not oppose the application. The business of the "Tank House" is at an end, and thus one of the worst social dens in the city is broken np. 

DEATH OF LEWIS D. CAMPBELL. On Sabbath morning, Nov. 20th, the spirit of Col. Lewis D. Campbell, one of the greatest of Ohio men, passed quietly from its earthly tenement to its eternal abode. For some time previous to his death, Mr. Campbell experienced a seri ous decline in health, and his family and friends began to realize that the stern old warrior and gifted statesman was nearingthe end of nis eventful life. His strength gradually failed him, though his intellect was never clouded. He was confined to his bed for several days, daring which time all that loving hands could do was done, but it was be yond human power to stay the steady approach of the winged messenger. His aged wife and three daughters survive him. MR. CAMPBELL'S LIFE. biographical sketch is compiled from Barns's History of the Congress of the United States: Hon. Lewis D. CaniDbeU was bnrn in Franklin, Warren county, Ohio, August I 9, 181 1. He attended school in Franklin in a log school house, with Hon. Robert C. 8chenck, until he was fourteen years oiu, wuen ne was transferred to the farm on which he labored three years. From vsm uniu ma tie served an apprentice ship in the office of the Cincinnati Ga zette. In the latter year he went to iiamiuon, uhlo, where he published ( weekly newspaper, writing the editor ials andother matter, setting it up.print lng the issue on an old Washington press, and acting most of the time as nis own carrier. In this paper he advo cated the election of Henry Clay to the Presidency. While editing his journal ut Htuuieu law, ana in lb.io was admit tea to the bar. He soon acquired a largi and lucrative practice. In 1848 Mr, Campbell was elected a Representative in Congress over Gen. Baldwin. In 1850 he was elected to the same position over Judge Vance; in 1752, 1854 and 1858 over Hon. C. L. Vallandigham, and in 1870 over tion. K. C. Schenck. This was nis most celebrated campaign, for he had not only the influence and money of the administration to contend with, but a jarge Kepuoncan majority, and the in fluence and money of Eastern monopo lies that favored a hicrh tariff. In the thirty-third Congress, when the great question or repealing the Missouri compromise came before the House of representatives, he was selected, in a conference oi tne opposition members, as their leader on the floor. Being a guuu parliamentarian ana a ready deba ter, with a good voice, he discharged the duties thus assigned him during that long and ever memorable struggle with eminent satisfaction to the friends of freedom, meeting in discussion the ablest men of the South. The debate between him and Hon. Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, on the relative ad vantage or tree and slave labor, gave him rank with the ablest debaters of congress. Among the measures reported bv him which became laws was the tariff act of 1857, which levied the lowest average duties ou imports of any act passed wilu- iu tne last naif century. When the Southern rebellion com menced Mr. Campbell ardently espoused the cause of the Union. In the soring mm summer oi isoi ne assisted in rais ing several regiments. In the autumn following he organized the Sixtv-ninth Ohio regiment, and was commissioned Colonel: In the winter of 18(51-2 he was in command of Camp Chase, where he received and kept as prisoners of war the officers taken at Fort Donelson and in other battles. In April following he went under orders with his regiment to Tennessee, where he served in the Army of the Cumberland until the failure of his health u nutted him for the service, when he reluctantly retired. In 18tu Mr. Campbell was appointed Minister to Mexico the successor of Hon. Thomas Corwin. In November of that year, accompanied by General Sher man, ne proceeded on bis mission. The b rench army of occupation and other forces of Maximilian were then in Mex lco holding the capital and other Drin cipal cities. President Juarez and his cabinet officers had Ibeen driven to a point ou the north-western border, Failing to reach the government of that republic in its men migratory condi tion, Mr. Campbell was directed by Mr. Seward, Secretary of State, to make his official residence, tempororily, in New Orleans. He remained there until June following, when, tired of that kind of service, he resigned. Taking his seat as a member of the Forty-second Congress in March, 1871, he was at once recognized as possessing that commanding influence which is at tained only by long and honorable pub lic service. Acting with the minority, he was not placed in such a position as to take the leading part which had fal len to his lot in previous congressional service, yet his influence was very per ceptible in the promotion of salutary legislation. But few remained w ho had heard his eloquence in former years, yet his latest efforts were heard with that attention and interest which evinced that he had not lost his power argument and oratory. In April. 1873, immediately after the close of the Forty-second Congress, Mr. Campbell was elected a delegate to the convention to revise and amend the Constitution of the State of Ohio. After the convention assembled at Columbus, he wao elected on the 22d day of May its vice-president by a unanimous vote. In politics Mr. Campbell commenced his career in the school of Clay, Webster and others; was always an active mem ber of the Whig party until Its dissolu tion. Subsequently he was identified with the Republican party. After the war of the rebellion closed he left the party, believing that by its reconstruc tion and other acts it had abandoned the principles upon which the war had been prosecuted, and that its measures of cen tralization were anti-republican and of imperial tendency. He then co-operated with the Democratic party, and sup ported Mr. Greeley for the Presidency in 1872, Tilden in 1876, and General Han cock in 1880. Mr. Campbell's ancestors emigrated from the Highlands of Scotland and set tled in Virginia and Pennsylvania. . is McVEAGH ON THE 

DORSEY LETTER. New Yokk. Dec. 2. Ex-Attorney-Gen eral McVeagh, who is in New York, says of ex-Senator Uorsey's letter charging him with violating confidence during his term of otlics: "The whole letter is a tiHsue of falsehood frrm boginning to end, except the one solitary fact that I biected to aay secret examination. Before I entered the Cabinet of Presi dent Garfield, Mr. Dorsey painted me in very uuiavorabie colors, if I was as bad as he represented, why did he come to see me as he says, and entrust me with this confidential business? Every thing that was necessary to be said on the subject of the Star Routes, I placed in my letter 10 president Artnur, and that 1 consider a sufficient reply, as I then explained everything," of in to in DR.

EXPENSIVE TRIAL. Columbds, O., December 2. The trial Watson, the Legislature briber, in which the jury disagreed, will now have be tried over again. It has been a very expensive trial to this county.

With the additional ex- euse of about the same- amount in the Wright and Bloch trials, one may safely say that the disgraceful action of the Legislature of last winter will cost the ax payers of Franklin countv about $7,500. FRANK FRAYNE FREE. A Doctor Murdered by His Partner in Denver. Congress Has Convened and the President's Message Was Received And Ordered Printed. Cincinnati, Dec. 2. Frank Frayn was before the Police Court this morn lng on the charge of manslaughter, for shooting Annie Von Behren at the Coli seuni during the performance of "Si Blocum," at the Thanksgiving matinee He aDDeared onite calm at the hrin. ning, but as the testimony proceeded he was restless, and at times deeply affect ed. The prosecution ordered the testi mony of Serjreant Benninger. who saw the shot, and who arrested Frayne, and oi Mr. Bean, a member of the company wno explained the cause or the acci dent, lie said the thread of the screw that held the spring catch was worn or torn off, and the screw was blown out ofthdigun. The catch losing its hold permitted the gun barrel to drop, and and that sent the bullet below its aim, Air. Frayne's breast and neck were burned and blackened by the powder es caping at the breech of the gun. The proseention here rested, and said the charge of manslaughter should be sus tained by the statute which forbids any one to point a loaded gun at or toward another person. The counsel for Frayne claimed that the statute did not apply, as the eon was not pointed at her, but at an apple, six inches above her head. He suggested also that Frayne had already suffered the worst that could happen to anyone, and that no punishment by the law could give greater weight to the lesson of this ac cident. Judge Heghty leaned to the opinion that the statute was not dis obeyed in this case, because the gun was aimed at an object and not at a per- Onn 1 1 n audi f ha taatimAlIlt alaa.la showed that.thore was not the slightest criminal intent, and the prisoner should be discharged.

Every motherless child should he cared for by a childless motiier. This comes aa near the order of nature as may be. There ought to be more method to secure thin arrancrnmnnt.. There is, however, little method in our charities. At our Children's Home, for example, are near 150 children. The trouble is to find places for the little ones. There is no system of effort to get the little ones into families where they might serve and be served, and be c:'iue tne ngnt ana delight of many household. - The location of our Home, near five miles south of Alliance, is inconvenien for general visitation and publicity. It is, as it were, buried from public view We opposed its present location, satis fled it would prove a serious mistake, However, there it is, and likely to be for a time at least, and the Trustees find children continue to come faster than they go, and the Home la be coming more and more crowded. The County Commissioners of Columbiana and stark have been solicited to employ a competent laay to travel ana labor in the interest of the Home to find places for the little ones in households; but these officials doubt their authority to uo so. Some plan should be adopted by which the childless should visit frequently the nome ana see tne interesting little ones. In this way an interest would be awakened and vast good done to yonng and old. A systematic effort should be made in this direction. Benevolent people throughout both counties would gladly assist. The younger these little ones are when taken, the better. hince our Home was established an intant wair, a male, and beautiful as bright, was adopted by a childless couple Long since the little fellow became the light of the household. The Trustees of the Home did not know the parentage of the child, only that he was born in a lying-in hospital at Cleveland and out of wedlock. The excellent people who adopted have been anxious to ascertain the parentage of their lovely little boy, only out of regard for him and have been at some trouble in this direction out so far tuey nave failed, it seems the mother entered the hospital under an assumed name, only giving her county, and in due time left as she came, leaving no trace.
