PRICE FIVE CENTS a IRISH GIVEN SAME STATUS AS CANADA, NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA DIPLOMATS SEEKING ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR ANGLO-JAPANESE PACT; AMERICA CAUTIOUS EXPECT SENATE L Hughes Wants to Give Solons Chance to Let Ideas Become Known. Foreign Powers After U. S. to Enter Pact on Far East Questions. Washington, Dec. 6.— (By The As sociated Press).—The effort to find an acceptable substitute for the Anglo Japanese alliance has so diverted the nttention of many of the arms dele gates as to throw even the .question of the naval ratio temporarily into the background. Both the Japanese and British have shown a desire to include the United States in an entente that may replace the alliance, and a tentative treaty draft under consideration by some gov ernments concerned would provide for a quadruple arrangement, also includ ing France. U. S. Delegates Silent What may have been the attitude of the Américan delegates in the behind the-scenes developments having to do with the proposal remains a mystery. Taking the position that no entente Suggestion is "formally" before them the American representatives stead fastly refused to discuss publicly the possibility of American participation in a political agreement regarding the far east In the absence of an .authoritative explanation of the American view point, the impression is gained by the delegates of other powers that the American plenipotentiaries are feeling their way very cautiously as they seek to ascertain what course would be in accord with American official and public opinion. Recognizing the senate's claim to partnership in the shaping of inter national agreements, Secretary Hughes and his colleagues are said to be solicitious that the sentiment of the treaty-ratifying branch of the govern ment, as well as that of the executive, shall be taken into account. How an accurate canvass of senate opinion could be made in the midst of the negotiations, however, presents still another puzzle. "A gentleman's agreement"' or "un derstanding" if that diplomatic instru ments were used in the place of a treaty, would not require senate con firmation, but President Harding and other administration officials have in dicated they do not propose to take steps which senators might regard as ignoring the senate's claim to partici pate in international policies. All of these considerations are be ing weighed carefully by the foreign delegates who desire to have the United States a party to the next far eastern concert of nations. There have been indications that the other powers concerned would prefer that the agree ment be put into the form of a treaty, hut it remains to be seen how far they Will press the suggestion when they understand fully the American constitutional system. Naval Dispute Delayed Some clue to help solve the riddle may be given in the near future by the senate itself. Speculation as to what course the negotiations may take is growing among senators as they come together for the new session, and sev eral have indicated they might seek :n a senate debate to bring the question of an entente more conspicuously be fore the public. . . The naval ratio negotiations still are at a standstill while the Japanese delegates wait for word from Tokio. It may be several days before they are in a position to resume the naval dis cussions. The full committee of the whole on the far east will meet again Wednesday after a recess of five days and will proceed with its discussions of Chinese problems.

FAVOR OF E Claims Harding Fails to Understand Labor Conditions at Present. Calls Attention to the Situation in Kansas Where Law Is Used. Washington, Dec. 6.—President Harding's suggestion, made in his mes sage to congress, Tuesday, for a court to decide wages and conditions of em ployment, was declared to be "rever sion to conditions obtaining more than 400 years ago." in a statement issued Tuesday night by Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor. , Does Not Understand. "The president's message is in most respects an admirable documents," the statement said, "but he, like altogeth er too many men, fails in his under standing of relations between workers and employers, of * * * * the aspira tions which were in the hearts and minds ot the great mass of « hit pie. "Indeed, the presidents proposal for the establishment of a court with legal powers to decide at; to wages and conditions of employment, is noth ing more or less than a reversion back to the conditions obtaining more than 400 years ago when the court of quar ter sessions determined the wages of i workers and prohibited them from ask ing for more or employers from pay ing more than the court's decision and to condemn mon to compulsory servi tude and slavery if they resented in anv way the decision of the courts. ♦ » ♦ * Refers to Kansas. "It is quite evident that the presi dent has in mind the establishment of a court or courts to determine the con dition and wages of working people and evidently with the aim that these courts will prevent strikes and lock outs. Surely the experience of such courts in the Australian countries, and the experience with such a court in Kansas, should have been a lesson for us. In New Zealand and in other Australian countries they have gone through the experience of more than 20 years and their utter failure has not only been recognized there but they have been abandoned. In Kansas where such a court lias been in ex istence for two years there are today more strikes and more mem on strike than at any time in the history of Kansas." Chinese Delegates Advised to Stand Firm in Demands Washington, Dec. 6.—(By The As sociated Press.)—The Chinese delega tion to the armament conference, it was learned Tuesday, has received ex plicit instructions from the Peking government not to recede from its po sition for the unconditional return of the Kiao Chau lease hold in Shantung and to protect China's interest in Man churia. Many cablegrams are being received daily from various organiza tions in China to the same effect. It was said by Chinese spokesmen Tuesday that should the Shantung "conversations" result adversely to China's interests, the delegation might have to consider withdrawing. It was emphasized there was no present intention of doing so. President Accepts • Wood-Forbes Report Washington, Dec. 0.—President Harding is understood to have accept ed the conclusions and recommenda tions of the Wood-Forbes mission which studied conditions in the Philip pine Islands and recently submitted a report.

Minnesota State Troops Ordered Out to Prevent Riots at Packing Plants • j I j j ; St. Paul, Dec. 6.—Announcement that national guard troops have been called out Wednesday to patrol the packing plant district in South St. Paul where close picketing by striking employes has prevented the iise of strike breakers, was made Tuesday night. The announcement was made at the adjutant general's office after Adjutant General W. F. Rhinow had conferred over the telephone with Governor J. A. O. Preus, who is in Washington, D. C. Catling out of the troops follows unsuccessful attempts of both the Swift and Armour companies to bring in men to take the place of strikers, and after conferences with labor leaders had failed to effect an agreement for a dis continuance of the picketing. Four hundred members of St. Paul companies of the guard will be sent to South St. Paul as soon as they can be mobilized. It was said eanly Tues day night that the first troops would arrive there about midnight. Major J. L. Lewis will be battalion commander and Adjutant General Rhinow will take personal charge, with Lieutenant Colonel E. A. Walsh, assistant adjutant general, assisting him. About 200 men will be sent to the Swift plant and 200 others to the Armour plant. Motor trucks are rushing cots and supplies. Arrangements have been made to house the men in buildings at the plants and at the stockyards. General Rhinow said he informed Governor J. A. O. Preus that the strikers and pickets had failed to keep a promise made to him earlier in the day that pickets wou!d allow workers access to and from their places of employment without molestation. Martial law has not been declared. Companies A, B, C and D, of the Sixth infantry of St. Paul and the headquarters company of the third battalion of the Sixth infantry of -St. Paul park were ordered to mobilize at the St. Paul armory. All motor trucks and light equipment the national guard available in the Twin Cities also were ordered to the "0mtr y. The troops were ordered to carry their mess kits, blankets, cots, arms, packs and 90 rounds of ammunition. All men of the headquarters and service companies will be armed with pistols or rifles. Lieutenant Colonel H. L. Brady, of the quartermaster department, was instructed by General Rhinow to furnish equipment for the men. It is now planned to call out more than the 400 troops, but arrangements will be made so that more may be mobilized on short notice in case of necessity, it was said. - At Fort Worth, Texas, two strike sympathizers were shot and wounded and a negro who, it is said, did the shooting, was severely beaten. At Omaha, Neb., missiles were thrown by various persons, including women, in clashes between strike sympathizers and workmen. At Chicago policemen with drawn revolvers held a crowd of 300 persons at bay until reserves arrived, after arresting strike sympathizers said to have beaten a workman. A man and his daughter, packing plant employes, were twice attacked by strike sympathizers as they started to leave a packing plant and several arrests were made for minor disturbances. While little violence was reported at Kansas City, Kansas, the district leader of the union men in an address defied the Kansas court of industrial relations to stop the strike, asserting he would rather go to jail than give up. Union officials asserted 6,000 more workers had joined the strikers' ranks in Chicago, while the packers reported that between 90 and 95 per cent of their men were working and that Ihe places of strikers had been filled from the hundreds of unemployed applying for work. Cornelius Hayes, president of the meat workers, said 12,000 workmen were on strike here. He salo no definite figures were available for other sections, but that more men were out than on Monday when the union esti mated 29,000 workmen were on strike outside Chicago. I Know You Never Loved" Says Mrs. Obenchain In Her Letter to Murdered Broker Los Angeles, Dec. 6.—Reading of letters written by Mrs. Madalynne Obenchain occupied almost the entire session Tuesday of trial of Arthur C. Burch, for the alleged murder of J. Beltoin Kennedy. The letters were ad dressed to Kennedy and ranged in their tone from expressions of pas sionate fondness to bitter denuncia tion. Their dates ranged from early in 1917 to July 19 last, less than three weeks before the time the prosecution contends Burch shot and killed Ken nedy with the knowledge and conni vance of Mrs. Obenchain. One letter dated Coronado, Cal., in June. 1918, was signed "Mrs. J, ^el ton Kennedy," the handwriting having been identified as that of Mrs. Oben chain who was then Miss Madelynne Connor. Half a dozen others contain ing expressions of affection, also dat ed in 1918. followed. Then came a jump to February, 4, 1919, or about a month after the writer married Ralph R. Obenchain of Chicago. This letter, dated in Los Angeles, and addressed to Kennedy, in this city, contained these passages: "How life has changed. * * * *. Lit tle did I dream that man made laws could bind me so closely to another. » » * » Dear heart, believe in- a here after for I know there is something beyond this." A subsequent letter dated in the same month contained this passage: "You and I know why all this had to be. Keep faith and pray." A letter dated Los Angeles, May 7, 1919, invited Kennedy to eall on the writer at a downtown hotel and was signed "Your sweetheart wife." A letter dated Evanston, Ills., Oct ober 7, 1919, read: "Have talked with R. all afternoon and will try to get an annulment at oace. *.;*** He has consented to let me fjp." Subsequent letters urged Kennedy to go to Chicago, one dated December 27, 1919, containing the statement:, 'If you are not here by January 16, wU L g0 , ,? • îf' I" ebru ary 23, following there was another, stating, have discarded the name Obenchain. * * * Play the part of a gentleman and return my let On May 1, 1920, Mrs. Obenchain wrote, telling Kennedy not. to go to Chicago, declaring he "had his chance," and again asked for h*r letters. An undated letter was next introduced, in which she wrote she would have her annulment in a few weeks. "It almost kills me to see how U. takes it," she added, and in thp same letter wrote: "R. does not know how soon I nm going to marry." In another uiidated letter, the writer declared she had told "R." she was to be married to Ken nedy within a few weeks. "I want you to wire immediately if you are coming here," she continued. "I have told R. that unless you come for" me in a few weeks I will go back to him." On July 17 last, at Los Angeles, Mrs. Obenchain wrote to Kennedy: "I know you have never loved. You will never see or hear from me again." Two days later she wrote a letter ask ing him to forgive her. "I know you love me," the letter read. "You have been wonderful. Truly in my heart I have never doubted you." ■When the last letter was written, according to other testimony, Mrs. Obenchain had wired Burch in Chicago to come to her in Log Angeles and he had replied he would do so. J. D. Kennedy, father of the slain man, was on the witness stand when the letters were being read, identify ing them as having been found either in his son's room or safety deposit box. Obenchain, who is counsel for his former wife, whose trial is scheduled to follow that of Burch, was in court while the letters were being read. E 

PEOPLE Development of Coun try Held Back by Lack of Necessary Factors. Recommends Passage of Liberal Mining and Land Regulations. Washington. Dec. 6.—More liberaliz ed laws with an administration co ordinated and brought nearer home is the paramount need of Alaska, Gov ernor Scott C. Bone said in his first annual report made public Tuesday by the interior department. "Capital and people are required to develop the resources of the territory," he said, "and until it is made easier for these two necessary factors to ob tain a foothold the territory will not progress. Under the present long range system of government individual initiative has been halted and the pio neer spirit maimed." Centralize Administration To promote efficiency by minimizing delays, the governor recommends that the administration be centralized at Juneau, the territorial capital, to the fullest extent possible while govern ment supervision be maintained at Washington with the various bureaus dealing with the territory consolidated j under one departmental head.
