CHAItLEB CATLIN, Secretary. FRIDAY, DECKiIIIEU 0, 1881. VTiik western Imlf of Dakota is worthless for agrlculluml purposes. Assuming that there Is a population of 20,000 in thcThreo iJtack Hills- counties—a libera! estimate— tiiore are probably not 5,000 white persons in all the rest of the immense area west of the Missouri River. Thu residents in this re gion are so few tlmt they cut no figure at all lit the census of 1880. . Yet there are several stageToutea and a railroad running through this part of the Territory. If it had any ca pacity for agriculture the tact would long ago have been known and tho rush of immi gration would have overflowed tho whole western part of tho Territory ns It has tho eastern part Thenttcmptto divide this worth less western h'nif In two by mi east-aml-west fine and give half of It to each of two new Stales ought.not to succeed. Tho Territory should bo admitted as a whole, and the west ern part which has no power of sustaining a population, should bo thrown In os a make weight with the fertile lands In tho oast and north. Tm; reported Intention of appointing Mr. Itoborl T. Lincoln to a foreign mission as a means to removing Idm from tho place ho now occupies In tho Cabinet would bo an ungrateful and unfair use of tho Executive privilege. The appointment of Mr. Lincoln us Secretary of War by President Garfield was received with pleasure all over the coun try, and for similar reasons his removal will meet with general disapproval. It is now thoroughly understood that President Ar thur Intends to umko up his Cabinet entirely Trom so-called “Stalwart” material, but it snot necessary to get rid of Mr. Lincoln In mlor to carry out that program, Mr. Lin coln was ono of tho most unselfish, con scientious, and clllclont workers in tho third lerm movement, and if Gen. Garfield was generous enough to pick him out ns one of Ids Cabinet notwithstanding that fact, Gen. Arthur ought to bo. just enough to retain him after ho made the sacrifice of giving up bis law practice and removing to Washing ton. It would not bo unllko “Stalwart” practices, however, If Mr. Lincoln were sac rificed to some selfish or sectional purpose. It Is evident that John W. Gultoau prefers that tho nssnsln, his brother, shall pay tho penalty of id* crime rather than that tbeir fattier shall have fastened upon him tho falsehood of insanity. And this fact Is a significant commentary on tho character ofthoassasln as viewed by his brother. It seems, at tho first blush, cruel in tho brother nut to bo willing to save tho life of Ids near kinsman at Uio expense of an assault upon Ids father’s memory In a collateral proceed ing. It Is In this fact that tho significance of John W. Gnitcau’s declaration that “ ho Is In Washington to defend tho memory of his father, Luther W. Gulteau, from Uio charge of Insanity” appears. Ills contempt nml detestation of tho character of the nssnsln of tho President is stronger than Uio ties of blood. Uo regards tho memory of his dead father as more precious than the vllo lifivof Ids Infamous bvoUier. It is plain that John W. Gulteau entertains so poor on opinion of Ids brother’s character that ho thinks it moro creditable to the family that ho should hang than that Uio taint of Insanity should bo at tached to Uio Gulteau namo forever. This being tho case, some conception may bo formed of the detestation John W. Gulteau fads for Charles J. Gulteau. Hu evidently believes that the assasln Is not Insane, but Is without a single redeeming trait; Unit if ac quitted ho would not bo suffered to live, and that It is better to accept Uio situation, to let Uio law do lot work, rather than drag the family name In Uio miro of Insanity In a fruitless effort to save u life <that Is Justly forfeit. What a contrast Is presented by Uio brothers 1 This Arthur-Folger project to demonetize the JMS lultllous of legal-tender greenbacks, and to abolish sliver certificates, and to stop the coinage of sliver money U slmuly and solely a device for doubling up the value of bonds, mortgages, money, and credits of ull forms. Its, direct elfect and the object of ,-hose with whom It originates is to enable •he money-lenders to fasten their lingers lightly about tiio throats of their debtors, and compel tho lultorlo pay hack two dollars for every ono they have received. Tim word debtor would hccomo a synonym for victim, the word creditor n synonym for swindler. Tho scheme Is robbery, nothing more nor less. Tho debtor would tender Immyinenl of his debt tho greenbacks ho had received, and tho creditor would tell him to go and get gold. Tho currency would bo reduced at unco by 3dt1.0DU.009 of cor* llUnites representing tho actual deposit of so many silver dollars, and the business of the country would suiter accordingly. Tho growth of business In the future would be stunted, and tho necessities, of tho debtor Increased, by tho elimination of silver coin from the money resources of tho land. Every farmer whose land Is mortgaged, every householder who owes n balance on his home, every inerelmnl, manufacturer, and trader who conducts a business larger In volume than his actual capital, would find himself In the tolls. Tho money-lenders alone would bo tho beneficiaries of this huge contraction scheme, and tho entrepreneurs— tho men who have the enterprise and lake tho risks which develop tho country, supply em ployment for labor, till the ground, hntldtho mills, construct the railroads, enlarge the commerce, and contribute to the progressand prosperity of tho American people—all these would*bo at Urn niorey of usur ers, tho gobbles, ami tho cent-pcr-cent brokers. Fortunately there Is no rea son for alarm, because thcro Is no danger that tho contrnbtlon scheme will re ceive the Indorsement of Congress. The number ot Conoressmcn from districts west of the Alleghenies who can he used to servo tho money-lenders may bo counted on tho fingers of ono hand. Hut this docs not ex tenuate the willingness of Folger to act ns a tool, nor tho folly of the President In approv ing tho former’s suggestion. The Adminis tration will find this avowed policy of con traction suicidal unless It shall cut loose from It without more delay. It was precisely this danger President Arthur Incurred when he yielded to tho Importunities of Wall street ami appointed the very agent whom It was proposed to Impose upon Garfield. It Is easy to understand how a man who endeav ored to bent the Government out of 3170,000 to which ho had no claim should nr go a scheme designed to rob Urn masses of un counted millions, but It Is not clear why tho President of the United Stales, just entering upon an Administration of threo years, should hlacuen his future by lending counte nance to such a policy. .S 1.9.1 . 5.00 . fto.ou 

ASSAULT ON THE CURRENCY BY THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY. Thu new Administration Is committed by tho I’rusidenl’s message and tho report of tho Secretary of the Treasury to a financial policy which, If persisted in. will wrouk it, and, In the meantime, may Injure tho country. This policy Is no more nor less than a vast scheme of contraction!. Thu Secretary recommends (1) the early retire ment of tho silver certificates, now rep resenting $00,000,000 of the best and most pophlar currency, and tho repeal of the law authorizing further issue thereof; (2) tho practical demonetization of silver by tho suspension of the coinage of standard sliver dollars; and (3) a repeal of tho legal-tender property of tho greenback notes. Tho l*res identin his message specifically approves of the first two of Uioso suggestions, and gives a tacit assent to the third. These three recommendations embrace tlie necessary preliminary steps to a reduction of the legal-tender resources of tho country to the limited, inadequate supply of gold alone. Thu proposition Is the revival of tho old Wall street and money-lenders’ scheme, which has been defeated In Con gress and before tho pcoplo every time and in every shape It has been brought forward. Its renewal at the very beginning of an Ad ministration which is under tiio predominate intluuneuof Wall street is sunidoiilto arouse popular apprehension and create general distrust. If tho people believed there were really any danger of these measure.'! meet ing with approval from Congress the sug gestion thereof would bo enough to produce something like a panic in anticipation of tho inevitable disaster tlmt would follow their adoption. Tho Secretary of tho Treasury affects an apprehension of trouble from a possible contraction of tho currency that may result from a movement among the banks for tho withdrawal of bonds and retirement of their notes, and advises that a law bo passed pro hibiting them from retiring their currency except after a previous notice of a fixed period to bo determined by Congress. This is a transparent piece of hypocrisy on his part, for he himself advises a sudden mid enormous contraction of the currency by tho retirement of 500,000,000 of silver certificates, and a steady, growing, and’ stilling contraction hi tlio future by the pro hibition of the further issue of the silver cer tificates, tiro further coinage of silver dollars,, and tho further use of 850 millions of legal-tender notes. If there were reason to fear that tho National banks should combine to retire tho total amount of their circulating notes (of which there is not the slightest danger so lung us tho country will use that kind of currency), such a prospect would nut bo so alarming as the threat of cutting off tho supply of silver dollars, sllvercertlllcates, and tho legal-tender use of greenbacks. It there bo any dan ger, ns tho Secretary of the Treasury pre tends to believe, pint tho National banks may reduce their circulation to any extent that shall cause “ grave embarrassments to bust ness,” what belter protection can tho coun try enjoy tlmii • a reliance upon tho coin age of silver dollars and tho issue of silver certificates, representing the actual deposit of coin? While affecting to believe that a contraction of tho currency 1 may result from some concerted action of tho banks, the astute Secretary of tho Treas ury, who has had about six weeks* experi ence in National finance, deliberately pro poses to deprive tho American people of an ample and permanent relief against such contraction by abandoning sliver, silver cer tificates, and tho legal-tender greenbacks, and by reducing the debt-puylmc money of the country to gold. Such a proposition Is as Illogical ns U Is hazardous and Injurious. It can hardly fall to puzzle the thinking people of this country to guess why the Act ing President and his chosen Secretary of the Treasury should start out by suggesting an agitation for a revolutionary change In a currency which is absolutely safe In its sev eral varieties, abundant in volume, respon sive to business necessities, and satisfactory to the masses. There is only one explana tion for this apparently errotio and per verse course. It has been adopted In obedience to the dictation of Wall street and the mortgage-holders and money lenders of the Kust, Poiger is acting os the r.gent of a aolllsh class, and the Acting Pres ident seems disposed to aid and abet him in Ids effort to do the bidding of his employers. Tho experience of ex-Secretary Bhermau ought to have warned them both that the adoption of Wall street cuUhroot Ideas would only bring the Administration Into contempt. Sherman made these same ideas the basis of Ids campaign to secure the Pres idential nomination; and, notwithstanding Ids lavish use of patronage and «ho help he procured from the money-loaning class whom he served, ids Presidential effort was a com- THE 

CHICAGO TRIBUNE plcte fizzle. If Sherman could live over again the years .he passed under Hayes Irt working up his Presidential candidacy, he would not again recommend Die demonetiza tion of sliver and greenbacks; and both Ar thur and Folger will regret that they loaned themselves (o tho same sectional, selfish, greedy, grasping scheme of contraction. WEED OP A KAVT. The question of building a navy, or so Im proving the present navy of this country that it will ho worthy of taking rank among tho navies of tho world, Is now actively can vassed In naval circles, anti has been recom mended to tho consideration of Congress by tho Secretary of the Navy and the President. Wo print elsewhere a somewhat exhaustive article from tho Now York JfcroM, setting forth upon tho authority of naval ofilcers the present condition of our navy mid what Is needed to make It efllclcnl. The hill which, ns the outcome of this ag itation, will soon be presented * to Congress, will provide for tho building of thirty-eight new vessels, live ram's, five torpedo gun boats, nnd twenty torpedo-boats, and sug gests that there are now In existence a cer tain number ot vessels which can he thrown In, and In this way tho Secretary of the Navy Is confident that In eight years’ time wo can have a navy, the estimated cost being <507,000. 'Mis‘looks well upon paper, hut comparative figures damage the proposition. Tho Government bus spent upon the navy since the close of tho War over 3900,00 c o>o. TJie expenditures of'tho past live years have been as follows: IVm*. HriwulUnrt, to. fPt.WtI.iWM P‘77 It.aVMCK 1878 17.iWtt.U0l 1«M Rim,CM 1880. 

UWO.OSI Total. If wo cun have a navy now for about 390.000. In eight'years, how Is It that In llvo years 880,000,000 have been expended nnd wo have no navy? How is It that our Admirals are quite sura that Chill, in case of our Interference 'with her designs upon X’eru, can send a licet to bombard Snu Fran cisco, nnd that we cannot prevent her? If 380.000. have been expended without any result, what assurance can wo have that there will be any result from tho expenditure of a much smaller sum There is no question tlmt wo tmvo an Insig nificant ami contemptible navy. Tliere Is no question that there should bo a chance. There Is no question tlmt it Is somewhat gall- Inc to National pride to be menaced by a six penny Power anil to bo compelled to serious ly consider tiio menace, but the real ques tion is, how nro wo going to get tiio navy, and. if wo spend tho money, shall wo have, a navy then? We now have a navy of un soaworthy old tubs, a few tlmt will float, a great many that won’t float, ami a lot that are rotting - away, to represent $1)00,000,000 flung away In fifteen years. Tho first thing to bo done is to dispose of what wo have on hand fur old iron, if they nro of no other value, and, having done this, com mence a navy do noro, building It ns economically, us practically, and ns speedily ns possible, Instead of throw ing away any more money upon so called repairs. Any appropriation for tho improvement of our navy must bo regarded with the distrust that has been shown to wards all appropriations in the past for naval expenditure, unless It can bo shown tlmt the money is to be applied to a navy, and not to patching up old tubs year after year. Tho House will do well to go slowly and care fully hi this matter, urttlto provide tho coun try with some assurance that if tho money is spent there wlll.be something to show for it. it is possible to get u navy with money, for other countries have done It, but the meth ods of the past ilfleen years will nut do it. A HEW BANKRUPT LAW. In 1878 Congress repealed tho bankrupt law which had been hi force fur nearly twelve yours tuitl had been variously amended. Uy common judgment that law had become’ odious, mid practically served no purpose other than to enrich certain olllcors of the courts and the attorneys. It had called into existence a new tribe of legalized plunderers, who fattened on tho estates, leaving creditors nml debtors nothing. It practically com* polled creditors to accept whatever terms tho debtors ottered, in preference to appealing to the bankrupt court, where the entire assets were consumed In the costs. Tho misfortune of this country Is that all our legislation relating to civil or criminal actions in courts Is framed by members of the legal profession, and while ordinarily tins ought la commend the laws ns an evidence of tho care and Intelligence of those who pre pared them, unfortunately such laws are too often Inspired with a view to promote the fiecnnlary benefit of tho legal profession. Tho purpose to increase tho business and swell tho profits of the profession governs tho action of the legal trades-union ns gener ally ns like motives govern In less preten tious unions. One of tho great evils of tho legislation in tho several States Is Uio per sistent tinkering at tho law by tho legal mem bers In tho way of encouraging and promot ing litigation, and In Increasing the fees that may be gathered by the members of tho bar. It Is not tin uncommon caso to have members propose and advocate changes of the law In order to affect results la pending cases In which they have been employed. Several bills have been prepared to bo laid before Congress ot Us presentfceaslon em bodying drafts of a new bankrupt law, and Uiere will bo also strong and energetic pro tests against Uio enactment of any such law by the present or any future Congress. Ono of thoso protests, signed by 1,078 loading merchants of Now York, has already been forwarded to Washington, remonstrating ngalnst tho passage of a bankrupt law, and the remonstrants moke use of tho abuses and inducements to fraud under Uio law of 1807 as an all-sufficient reason why there should not bo another law. These merchants dread tho results of a law of this kind in Inducing debtors, when the chances of trade aro ad verse, to surrender Uiu wrecks of tbeir estates and, with legal discharges, ’begin anew. They insist that It is bettor fur all parties that Uio deotns should obtain a dis charge through private dealing directly with Uielr creditors, In which oases, they Insist, to an honest debtor talrnuss ami leniency Is never refused, but, on Ihe contrary, U Is to the Interest of creditors to maintain such persons In business. They declare that this rule Is so general, nml the kind feeling of tho creditor so certain, that In cases of honest debtors no bankruptcy Is necessary. In speaking of Uio dividends under the lost bankrupt law, they declnru Umt creditors did not average over 10 cents on Uie dollar, or not one-third as much ns the average received under private settlements between creditors and debtors, nml they attribute this, among oUicrJhtngs, to “the collusion of dishonest creditors and Uie aid of dishonest attorneys.” A bankrupt law ought to havo no oUior purpose thou Uio relief of honest debtors, ami when It is perverted Into a cloak for and an encouragement of dishonesty, then U Is a reproach to tho Government and a cor rupter of morals. When a bankrupt can offer to his creditors a dividend of 15 emits cash, and can show them that If he be placed In bankruptcy the estate will not divide over five cents on the dollar, and that this Is possi ble under the law, Uien the law is more dan gerous to public morals than anything that : 

FRIDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1831—TWELVE FAdRR. nmj happen because of tho want of n bunk* rupthtw. The aim of tho law should be to encourage ami promote honest settlements of estates, and It should not tolerate dishonesty muter any circumstances. This result could lie greatly aided by a law which would render tho settlement of bankrupt estates a matter not of excessive protits, but of reasonable compensation, The whole leirnt expenses of an estate should be limited by a maximum cost In large estates and by a minimum fee In smalt ones. The motive for ''a collusion between dishonest debtors and dishonest at* torneys” and avaricious legal ollleers should be defeated by stringent laws protecting es tates, amt protecting both creditors ami debt ors. It Is a reproach to our civilization that such a law cannot be framed and enacted by Congress, ORIGIN OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IK IL LINOIS. Tho Criminal Code of Illinois was drafted in 18*27. White it has been changed more or less for thu belter and at many points hi the definitions of crime and the penalties for them, It has been amended at few points amt then only for Uic tvnrsc in the mejhods of procedure. Tho following evil provisions dato back to lite code of ISJ7: 1. That the Jury shall bo Judges of tho law and the fact. & That tho Court shall in practical effect have no power of Instruction, as Uto Jury may do as 11 pleases, mid construe tho law to suit itself, regardless of tho opinions of tho Court. 3. That changes of ventio and continuances shall bo peremptory and beyond tho discre tion of the Court. 4. Tho whole section regulating tho inodo of appeal by writs of error mid supersedeas. ,(7w,P0e.0 These tiro fundamental parts of tho criminal procedure of Illinois us It stands today. They have done more than all other provisions of tho code combined to obstruct tho course of criminal Justice ami bring tho laws and tho courts of Illinois Into contempt. It may bo well to Imiuiro Into tho origin of (his remarkable code of 1827, whoso an* thorlty Is so vcnurablo ami blunders so sa crcd that our lawyers hnvu not dared for llfty-fonr years to lay violent hands on It and rip it up, as they ought to do: The criminal code of 18-27 was drafted by Judge .Lockwood, of the Supremo Court of tlmtday; and ho wrote about his work In a most apologetic tone years afterwards, lie says: In tboro wore no libraries In tho Slate to whioli I hud access. 1 laid brought with mo to ttiis Hutto a volume of tho Laws of New York passed In UkW, mid I found In the oillcu or the secretary of State a volume of tno Laws of Georgia. Thcao were all the aids / /mil in fram ing our criminal code of IKJL and the act regu lating ttui apprehension of criminals. 'J'lmt code tens ilcsifjncil tn apply to u iicuj cMtntrp. I tun nlnml n iviltkrHM#. touh but n small population, umi lilHe or nu uuricuUnruU commercial, or imam* /acturiuu Interests to protect. Such Is tho testimony of the author of tho sacred Criminal Code of lb'27 ns to Us origin and imperfections. Illinois now has a method of criminal procedure which Is derived part ly from tho Now York Code of eighty years ago and partly from obsolete statutes of tho State of Georgia; and when any changes have been introduced they have been tor Hie worse, and have Had the direct of giving tho criminal a further advantage and making the courts more impotent than before. Some of tho later abominations of the Illinois Code arc the following: 1. Kcaulrlng the Jmlgu to instruct tho Jury only In writing. A Jmlgu may not now volunteer any instructions without being asked;.or refuse any Instructions however discordant they may be with each other; nor make a concrete application of tho abstract principles of law contained In bis instruc tions to tho facts of a case. This idiotic law dates from ISI7. 2. Denying tlio people tm appeal or writ 6f error In criminal cases. The New York Code provides: “That an appeal to Urn Supremo Court may be taken by the people (1) Upon a Judgment for the defendant or a demurrer to the Indictment. (2) Upon an order ot the Court arresting Judgment.” The Illinois law dates from 1857. U. Allowing exceptions and appeals to bo taken by tho defendant from decisions of tho lower court overrullhg motions hi arrest of Judgment, motions to amend, for -contin uance, for change of venue, etc. This law, which gives to tho criminal the advantage of any technicality while tho people are de nied a writ of error for tiny cause whatever, dates from tho Revised statutes of 1845. Tho New York rule, which Is simple and com plete, Is that exceptions may be taken by tho defendant after the trial begins to a decision of the Court “admitting or rejecting wit nesses or testimony, or In deciding any gues tlon of law, not a matter of discretion, or (n charging or instructing tho Jury upon tho law In tho trial of the Issue.” Rut all those questions of continuances, changes of venue, etc., are “matters of discretion ” under the New York law. What Is tho' sense of the Illinois provision that error may bo alleged, first, for any of tho multilarlons acts and rulings of tho Judge during the trial, and then for his refusal to grant n now trial in animation ot these acts and rulings’.* There are other blotches of a more recent date In tho Illinois procedure; but it will bo seen that tho worst defects of the codp date buck to 1827, when the whole population of tho Stato was less than 150,000, or onc twentlcth of what it Is now, and tho abom inable law' gagging tho Judges dates hack to 1847, and Is thirty-four years old. Wo think It can bo shown at the proper timu that this law owed Us origin to the etVurts of the South ern slavocruts and Northern doughfaces to secure the return of fugitive slaves, it so, It Is one of tho Black Laws of Illinois, and ought now to bo abolished with the rest of them. .The demand for a revision of this rotten old codo must bo hooded. • Joint W, Gl'itkau declares that ho will defend the honored memory of his father, oven when It is unjustly as pursed to savo tho life of his unworthy brother. But Uiat brother never loses an opportunity to refer In coarse ami scurrilous language to ills father as M a crank 11 and V ® monomaniac on religion," amt to denounce him for having induced him Uho ussasln) to become a mom* bur of tho Oneida Community. This con* trust shows that the Quileau family possess strong Qualities of character and Qualities of a very diverse nature. John W, Qulteau is strong enough to repress alt feelings ot obli gation of kinship in obedience to a souse of Justice, whiioCharles Julius Qulteau Is moan enough to seek to blacken tho memory of his father to save his own life by a fraudulent pretense of Insanity. John W. Qulteau Is the assasiu's brother; ha knows him thor oughly, ami lie leaves him to his Just fate— Uio gallows 1 Charles JuUus Qulteau is an illustration of the capacity of the human mind for moral se)f*porvorsioUi itearud In an atmosphere of purity and of religious ml and devotion, ho spurned tho moral pro* cepts and the noble example of Ids father until he became utterly corrupt. James W. Scoville, a cousin of George Seo* vllle, after a personal • acquaintance of many years with the ossasln, describes him as “cold-blooded, soiAsli, and thor oughly disreputable, with uo other aim in life than to become notorious." lie says he is perfectly sane, and has always been so. lie condemns Ids cousin, George Scovllle, and says he himself desires “ the vindication of the law In ihoapmnlv hangingof ihoassashi.” The testimony of Wednesday Is of the nl mnsl Importance. A dozen neighbors of the assitslu’s father, who knew him Imm and in timately, swear positively to his perfect.san ity, This testimony utterly destroys tho hereditary insanity theory of tho defense, amt leaves tho nssnsln nothing builds Insan ity rfllo to depend upon, Tho farce draws to ji close, and tho verdict Is not far oIT.
