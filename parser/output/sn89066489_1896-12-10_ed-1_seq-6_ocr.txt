THE MESSAGE. The President Sends a Communfcation to Congress on National Affairs. THE CUBAN INSURRECTION. Government Revenues nd Expendltures Tbe Department The Tennlon Roll The Pacific Railroads Our financial Methods Truetsand Monopolies. Wasmxgton, Dec. 7. The rifty Fourth confess assembled for the short session at noon to-day and soon after committees from the house and senate waited on the president and in formed him that they were ready to receive any communication he mi-.'ht have to make and the president then sent the following communication: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the peopla in the legis JaUve branch of their government you have as sembled at a time when the strength and ex cellence of our free Institutions nnd the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest in volving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitter ness and passion, has been wngcd throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage, without disturbance of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness In our national structure. When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions we discover abundant evidence of a determi nation on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of thelrgnvernment Thus our peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en titles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty Invites. In obedience to a con stitutional requirement. I herein submit to the congress certain information concerning na tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg islation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tire some narration, I shall omit many details con cerning matters within federal control which. thoutrh bv no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental reports. I shall also curtail this communication by omitting minute recital of many minor inci dent connected with our foreign relations which have hitherto found a place In executive messages, but are now contained in a report of the secretary of state, which is herewith sub mitted. The Armenian Question. At the outset of a reference to more impor tant matters affecting our relations with foreign powers It would afford me satisfaction If could assure the congress that the disturbed condition of Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demands of human civilization, or as the re sult of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softening disposition or protective tnterven tlon, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequenl reports of the wanton destrue tlon of home: and the bloody butchery of men. women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, the.r safety In the future Is by no means assured. Our gov ernment at home and our minister at Constan tinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries In Ottoman territory, who constl tute nearly all the individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection ort the score of American citizenship. Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur nlsh all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims against the Turkish government for the pillage and de structton of missionary property at Harpool and Marash during uprisings at those places. The Insurrection In Cuba. The insurrection In Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It Is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made to wards the paci flea tlon of the Island or that the situation or affairs as depicted in my last an nual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all considerable towns, the Insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the in land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the Insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is evidenced by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased military and naval forces to the task, there Is much rea son to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, and character, and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb, without practi cally securing the great project for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-estab lished her authority, neither have the insur gents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the con test has gone on, the pretense that civil gov ernment exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it. has been practi cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less Imperfectly, In the large towns and their Immediate suburbs. But, that exception being made, the entire eountry is either given over to an archy or is subject to the mili tary occupation of one or the other party. It is reported. Indeed, on reliable au thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the Insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all at tempt to exercise Its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact) a government merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open, or in pttched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for and the Immense superiority of the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline and equipment, could hardly fall to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the country Is visible or invisible at pleasure and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on Its side. In a country where all that Is indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter Is so easily obtain able especially by those born and bred on the soil it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They also are participated In by bands of marauders, who now In the name of one party and now in the name of the other as may best suit the occasion, harry the countrv at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would. Inevitably entail Immense destruction of property even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent tt as tar as practicable But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish government. It has now apparent ly abandoned it. and is acting upon the same ) U ,he ,nurgents. namely, that the ex igencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not ?f?J! .i Uf nd antage to the enemy, ills to the same end that in pursuance of gen-''rders- Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural pop ulation required to concentrate itself In the towns. The sure result would seem to betbat the Industrial value of the Island is fast di minishing and unless there is a speedy and radical change In existing conditions, it will soon disappear altogether. That value con sists very largely, of course. In its capacity to produce sugars, a capacity already much re duced by the interruption to tillage, wnicn have taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should tbete In terruptions continue during the currant year, and practically extend, as it is now threat ened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be reoulred to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremly doubtful it capital can be induced to even! make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter . ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe would engage the serious attention of the gov ernment and people of the United States under j any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with It which Is by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest In It is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from 30,000,W) to t 0.0 0,000 of American cap ital are Invested in plantations and In railroad. mining and other business enterprises on the Island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1M9 amount ed to about t64.000.000. rose In 1993 to about tl03. 0.000, and in 1891. the year before the in surrection broke out, amounted to nearly 9S.- 001,0 0. Besides this large pecuniary stake In the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself Inextricably Involved In the present con test In other wavs. both vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and directly promote the insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings in interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection bv this government and not unnatu rally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests affected and considerations of philanthropy and hu manity in general have led to a vehement de mand in various quarters for some sort of pos itive Intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should be accorded to the insur gentsa proposition no longer urged because untimely and In practical operation clearly perilous and injurions to our own Interests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the Independence of the Insurgents should be recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be. no other exists there, unless the will of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now suggested that the United States should buy the island, a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to en tertain such a proposal It is urged, finally. that all other methods falling, the existing in ternecine strife In Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even at the cost of war between the United States and Spain, a war which its advocates confidently prophecy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in Its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be either affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless the character to main tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and might should be the rule of its con duct It would seem that If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. It was in timated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago thn if a satisfac tory measure of home rule were tendered the Cuban Insurgents and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty of its execution the United States would en deavor to find a way not objection able to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. It should be added that It cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely main talned. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all its features, and properly apprehend our inevita ble relations to it and its possible results with out considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way. or with our friendly co-operation. wnen tne inability of Spain to deal success fully with the insurrection has become mani fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover eignty Is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug gle for its re-establishment has degenerated Into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and then utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented In which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. The Venezuelan Boundary Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their re spective governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The provi sions ot tne treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto' may conndentiy be anticipated. Government Revenues and Expenses. The secretary of the treasury reports that during tne nscal year ended June 30. lsee, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to ttf9,l7.i.4 ars. During the same period its expenditures were S43i,687.64.48. The excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounted to I ,33.;3.7a The ordinary ex penditures ourmg tne year were t4.0l.S5i2l less man during tne preceding fiscal year. Of the recelots mentioned there were derived irom customs tne sum of t!60.o;i,7M.67. and from internal revenue. $143 830.615.6e. The re ceipts from customs show an increase of f7. NM.iJt.is over tnose from the same source for the fiscal year ended June SO, 1833. and the re ceipts from internal revenue an increase ot 13. -4. 537.91. The value of our imported dutiable merchan. dise during the last fiscal year was $39,757.470 and the value of free goods imported t4 9.967, 470. being an Increase of ?S.N3.e7 in the value ot dutiable goods and 91431.034 in the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our ex ports of merchandise, foreign and domestic amounted in value to 8$.6 6.93. being an in crease over the preceding year of 17 .088.773. The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable goods imported during the year was 39.94 per cent, ana on rree ana dutiable goods taken to gether alas per cent. The total amount of cold exported was tll2. 19.947and of silver t60,M1.670.being an increase of t45.941.446 of gold and tl3,216,3SI of silver over tne exportation of the preceding fiscal year. Tne imports ot gold were 3).VK.06i and of silver t28.777.1S, being t2.8 9.fSi less ot gold and t8.56S.c07 more of silver than during the preceaing rear. The total stock of metall money in toe L nited states at the close of the las: fiscal year endinj on the 30th dav of June. 1S96, was tl.2S.C6.035. of which t'.M97.9M was ot gold ana !&3.7iS,071 of silver. On ths 1st day of November, 1S3X the total stock of money of all kinds In the countrv w K.Si.4l0,?90 and the amount in circulation, not Including that In the treasury holdings, was HI A? Ai Alt w.;. o . . . , viu . jic capiut upon an estimated population ot 71.902.0u0. The production ot the precious metals in the United States during the calendar ves.r isas estimated to have been 2.S4,78 fine ounces ot go.o. oi tne value of t46.610.09X and sj iyu fine ounces ot sliver, of the commercial value of (34,445,000 and the coinage value of 17-.-051,000. The total coinage at the mints of the United States during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893. amounted to I7I.188.46S. 2, of which 5& S78.49J was in gold coin and tl6.8W.9m.S2 in standard silver dollars and minor coins. The number of national banks organized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed up to October 31. 1896. was soil, and of this number 3.079 were at the date last men tioned In active operation, having au thorized capital stock of t8M).01l.89.i, held bv 288.903 shareholders. and cir- culating notes amounting to Kl 1.412.620. The total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on the 31st of October, IS96 amounted to K34. 53,9u7, including unredeemed but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process of liquidation. The increase in na tional bank circulation during the year ended on that day was iSMM.iJU. On October, 183. when the condition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3.679 active institutions was tt.263.t&.31183. which in- luded fl.89l.2.83a 31 In loans and discounts and 136 .'.16 -,733. 8H In money of all kinds on hand Ot their liabilities tl.97.P9l.0i8 was due to Individual depositors and !09.94 1.019 con- isted of outstanding circulating notes. The War Department. The report of the secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions in the several branches of the public service Intrusted to his charge. The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law Is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morals of the army are excellent and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout its entire organiza tion. W ith the exception of delicate duties m the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary in which the Mexican troops co-operat-d and the compul sory, but peaceful return with the consent of Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operation have been required of the army dur ing the past year. The organized militia numbers 112.8.9 men. The appropriations for its support by the sev eral states approximate t.BOO.oiO annually and 100.000 is contributed by the general govern ment Investigation shows these troops to be unusually well drilled and inspired with much military interest, and in many instances they are so deficient in proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately prepared for field service. therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this condition and that every encouragement be given to this deserv ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol diers upon whose assistance we must largely rely In time of trouble During the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion of the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of for tifications along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made In providing the mate rial for submarine defense in connection with these works. This Improved situation is largely due to the receit generous response of congress to the recommendations of the war department The Attorney-t.eneral's Department. The attorney -general presents a detailed and interesting statement of the important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal year. The ownership and management by the government ot penitentiaries for the confinement of the convicted in the United States courts of violations of federal laws. which for many years has been a subject of executive recommendation, has at last to slight extent been realized by the utiliza tion of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary. This Is certainly a movement in the right di rection; but it ought to be at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge ment of this Improvised prison and the con struction ot at least one more, to be located in the southern states. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that the expense of Its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners It can accommodate does not make as econom ical an exhibit as It would if it were larger and better adapted to prison purposes: but I am thoroughly con vinced that economy, humanity and a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish for violation of federal law dictate that the federal government have the entire control and management of the peniten tiaries where convicted violators ore confined. It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth military prison to its new uses the work previously done by the prisoners con fined there, and for which expensive machin ery has been provided, has been discontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds It Is exceeding y desirable that the convicts confined in this penitentiary be al lowed to resume work of this description. The Post Office Department. Our post office department is in good condi tion and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, ls96. if allowance is made for imperfections in the laws applicable to it. is very satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were tSJ.499.20i 4a t he total expenditures were M. 0.0.8991 84. ex clusive of tl.oo9.898 27, which was-earned by he Pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government There was an Increase of receipts over the previous year of f5,M6,' 8 i.Hl, or 7.1 per cent, and an Increase of expenditures of Si.83.l:M.0l. or 4.43 per cent The deficit was il.CTJ 9 .6.19 less than that ot the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and are not in control of the postmaster-general. All that he can accomplish by the most watch ful administration and economy is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and account ing for public moneys and such minor savings in small expenditures and in letting those con tracts for post office supplies and star service which are not regulated by statute. The average revenue from each pound of first-class matter was 93 cents. From each pound of second-class, 84 mills (of the second- class 52,348. 97 was county free matter). From each pound of third-class. 13.1 cents. From each pound of fourth-class. 1 .5 cents. The growth in weight of second-class matter has been from :99,0'U,' pounds in 1891 to 312.00!!,- 0 in 1S9 and to almost 3i9.0hOjOi) in 1896. and it is quite evident this in creasing drawback is far outstripping any possible growth of postal revenues Our mall service should, of course, be such as to meet the wants and even the conven iences of the people, at a direct charge upon them so light as perhaps to exclude the idea of our post office department being a money making concern, but in the face of constantly recurring deficiencies in its revenue. and In view of the fact that we supply the best mail serv ice in the world. It seems to me it is quite time to correct the abuses that swell enor mously our annual deficit If we concede the puDlic policy or carrying weekly newspapers free in the county of publication and even the policy of carrying at less than one-tetnh of their co: other bona fide newspapers and periodicals. there can be no excuse for subjecting the serv ice to the further immense and increasing loss Involved in carrying at the nominal rate of one cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, which under the loose inter pretation of a loose statute has been gradually given second-class rales, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived from first-class matter, which pays three or four times more than its cost and producing a large annual loss to be paid by general taxation. Experience and observation have demon strated that certain improvements in the or ganization of the post office department must be serve! before we can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its adm.mstra tion. This involves the following reforms wnicn I earnestly recommend: There should be a small addition to the existing inspecloi service, to be employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers 13.ix0 men and performs its service practically without the surveillance exercised over al. other branches of the postal or public service. There should also be appointed a few Inspect ors who would assist the central office in nec essary investigation concerning matters of post office leases, post office sites, allowance for rent, fuel and lights, and in organizing and securing the best results from the work of th H.'.flJ clerks now employed in first and second- class offices. The Navy Department. ine work or the navy department and its present eenditions are fully exhibited la the report of the secretary. The construction ol vessels for our navy has been energetically prosecuted by the present administration upon the general lines previously adopted, the "de partment having seen no necessity for radical changes in prior methods under which the work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided, however, to provide in every ship building con tract that the builder should pay ail trial ex penses, and it ha-s also been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. On March 4, IS93, there were in commission but two armored vessels, the double-turreted monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since thit date, ot vessels theretofore authorized, there have been placed in their first commis sion three first-class and two second-class bat tleships, two armored cruisers, one harbor de fence ram and live double-turreted monitors. including Maine and Puritan. jut completed. lght new unarmored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commissioned The Iowa, another battlobip. will be completed about March I, and at least four more gunboats will be ready for sea in the early spring. The war college has developed into an insti tution which it is believed win be ot great value to the navy in teaching the science of j war, as well as in stimulating professional zeal In the navy, and it will be especially use ful In the devising of plans for the utilization. In case of necessity, of all the naval resources of the United States. The naval militia, which was authorized a few years ago, as an experiment, has now de- eloped into a body of enterprising young men. active and energetic la the discharge or their duties and promising great usefulness. This establishment has nearly the same relation to our navy as the national guard m the differ ent states bears to our army, and constitutes a source of supply to our naval forces, the im portance of which is immediately apparent The Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the interior presents a comprehensive and interesting ex hibit of the numerous and important affairs committed to his supervision It is impossible in this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the secretary gives full and instructive infor mation Our public lands, originally amount ing to 1.8t0.two,OJj acres have been so reduced that only about 600, n0,'H) acres still remain in government control, excluding Alaska The balance, being by far the most valuable por tion, has been given away to suttlers. to new states and to railroads, or sold at a compara tively nominal sum. The total Indian population of the United States is 177,S3. according to a census made in l9-, exclusive of those within tne state of New York and those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number there are approxi mately 38,000 children of school age. During the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended re cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipatian of continued liberal ap propriations to that end, cannot fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of In dian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization. The condition of affairs among the five civilized tribe9, who occupy large tracts of land in the Indian territory and who have governments of their own, has assumed such au aspect as Id render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of these Indians to the general government This seems to be necessary in furtherance of their own interests as well as for the protection of non-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws is uow negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment ot their courts and the division of their common lands In severalty. The reception of their first proffers of nego tiation was not encouraging, but through pa- ience and such conduct on their part as dem onstrated that their intentions were friendly and in the interest of the best prospect of suc cess has become more promising. The efforts should be to save the Indians from the conse quences of their own mistakes and Improvi dence and t-j secure to ths real Indian his rights as against intrudt r and professed friends who profit by his retogression. Asa sin.-ere friend of the Indian I a:n ex ceedingly anxious that these reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes and that no necessity may be pre sented for radical or drastic legislation. I hope, therefore, that tie commission now con ducting negotiations will soon be able to report that progress has been made toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties. It appears that a ve-y valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum has been' foun 1 on the reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom pahgre Ute Indians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every sensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this important source of public revenae as will except it from the general rules and incidents attending the ordinary dis position of public lands, and secure to the gov ernment a fair share at leas: of its advantages in place of its transfer far a nominal sura to interested individuals. I indorse the recommendation made by the present secretary of the interior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission. consisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be created to perform the duties now devolving upon the commis sioner and assistant commissioner ot Indian affairs. The management of the bureau in volves such numerous diversities and the advantages or an uninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested will meet the approval of the congress. The Pension Koll. The diminution of our enormous renslon roll and the decrease of pension expenditures which have been so often foretold still fail in material realization. The number of pension ers oa tne rolls at tne ciose of the fiscal year ended June 31, 1?H, was 970.678. This is the largest number ever reported. The amonnt paid exclusively for pensions during the year was 138.314,791.9 , a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while rie total expend itures on account of pensions, including the cost of maintainence of the department and expenses attending pension distribution amouniea 10 u;.juo. no . or witnin a verv small fraction or one-tcird of the entire ex pense of supporting the government during the same year. 1 he number of new pension certifi cates issued was. 90,610. Of these 40,374 repre sent original allowances of claims and 15.879 increases of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing In foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,78 i, and the amount paid to tbem during the year was f 2.i 3.1.33. The sum appropriated for the pay ment of pensions for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1-97. Is I JO.O i.0J i. and for the succeeding year it is estimated thai the same amount will be necessary. The commissioner of pensions reports that Curing the last fiscal year 333 indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon these indictments 157 convictions resulted. In my opinion, based upon such statements as these and much other informa tion and observations, the abuses which hava been allowed to creep into our pension system have done incalculable harm in demoralizing our people and undermining good citizenshin. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension roil and make it what it should be. a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of their country's affection ana rememDrance. The Pacific Railroads. The secretary calls attention to the public interests involved ia an adjustment of the ob ligations of the Pacific rai.roaJs to the govern ment I deem it to be an important duty to es pecially present tais subject to the consider- anon of tne congress. On January 11. JS7, wi n tie amount already matured, more than I3.0,.OW of the principal of the subsidiary bond is-ud by the United State in aid of the construction of tse Union Pacific railway, in cluding its Kansas line, and more than I6.O0O,- () of like bonds, issued In aid of the Central Pacific railroad, including those issued to the Western Pacific Railway Co., will have fallen oue ana been paid cr must on that day be raid by Use government With out any reference to tie application of the sinking funis now ia the treasury this will create such a default oa the part of tne companies to tae severe meet as will sive it the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its mortsage lien. In sedition to this indebtedness which will be due January I, 1S7. there will mature betweea thai dte and January 1. 199. the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds which must also be met by the government. These amount to more than

The department of BsrrleuKure is so inti mately related to the welfare of our people and ; the prosperity of our nation thn it slioul I con- j stantly receive the care and encouragement of i the poveroment The secretary reports that j the value of our exports of farm products dur- j ing the last fiscal year amounted to J T0.W.tX. an increase of W.OOO.tXW over j those of the year immediately rreceding This statement is not the less welcome be cause of the fact that notwithstanding such in crease, the proportion of exported agricultural products to our total exports of all description fell off during the year. The benefits of an in crease in agricultural products being assure !, the decrease in its proportion to our total ex ports is more gratifying when we consider that it is coming to the fact that such total exports for the year Increased more than "i.ntoXl The large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products suggests the great use fulness of the organization lately established in the department for the purpose of getting to those engaged in the farming pursuits re liable information concerning the condition. needs and advantages of different toreisu markets. Inasmuch as the success of the farmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and inasmuch as foreign mar kets must largely be the destination of such products, it is quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants taat affect these markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and reap ing with a better promise of profit Such information points out the way to a pru dent foresight in the selection and culiiva- on of crops and to a release from the bond ;e of unreasoning monoiomy of protection, a glutted and depressed market and constantly recurring unprofitable toil. In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the depart ment as at present conducted ought to be discontinued. Civil Service Reform. The progress made in civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula- ion. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of its enemies, and has gained a permanent place nmong the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and improve. economize and elevate the public service. There are now in the competitive classified service upwards of 8I.0OJ places. More than half of these have been included from time to time since March 4, 1S93. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated the 6th day of May. 1M96, and if fourth-class postmasterships are not in cluded in the statement it may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil service law ace nowclassified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmaster- ships, based upon economy, improved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If. however, obstacles prevent such action at present, I earnestly hope that congress will. without increasing post office appropriations. so adjust them as to permit in proper cases of a consolidation of these post offices to the end that through this process ihe result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The civil service rules as amended during the last year provide for a sensible and uni form method of promotion, basing eligibility to better positions upon demonstrated effi ciency and faithfulness. The absence of fixed rules cn this subj-ct has been an infirmity in the system more and more apparent: its other benefits have been better appreciated. The advantages of civil service methods In their business aspects are too well understood to re quire argument Their app icatton has be come a necessity to the executive work of the government But those who gain through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that the non - partisan scheme through which they ro.'cive their appointments tle- man-V-i from them, by way of reciprocity non partisan and faithful performance of duties under every administration, and cheerful fidel ity to every chief.

The Tariff. I desire to recur to the statements else where made concerning the government re ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and Its operations. This statute toon tffect on the -"Sth day of August, lsui. whatever may be its shortcomings as a comptete measure of tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened up the way , to a freer and greater ex change of commodities between us and other coui tries and thus furnished a wider , market for our products and manufactures. The only entire fiscal year during which this law h is been in force ended on the )th day of June, 1893. In that year our imports increased over those of the previous year more than t-i..V!0.o X) while the value of the domestic prod ucts exported and which found mar kets abroid was nearly :70.0 .0.000 more than during the preceding year. Those who insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their neelTul use should only be increased through tariff changes to an extent necessary torneet the expenses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff changes may be iavd upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and witn the additional purpose of so increasing ibeir price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable epnortunitle. must agree that our tariff laws are oaiy primarily justified a, sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary exp n-e of its maintenance. Con sidered as to its sufficiency ia this asp-ect the p esent law can by co means fall under just condemnation During the only corn;,lete fis cal year of its operation it has yielded nearly $fc 00j v n more revenue than was received from tariff duties ia the preceding year. Th ere was nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and expend. tares of a little more than J:v0,-P-tt Th s. however, was not unexpected. The situation was such in December last, seven months before the close or the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury fore told a deficiency of rl7.isj9.wi The great and increasing apprehension and timidity In busi ness circles and the depression in a J activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or operation, seriously checked the import we would have otherwise received ani readily account for the difference between this estimate of the f.e2re tary and the actual defScenc; a w-.:l as for a continued defirit I believe our present tariff law. if allowed a fair opportunity, will In the tear future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome iil difficulties. In the meantime no deficit that has o -carred or may oc -or need excite or ?isturi us. To meet such deficit we fav.i ia ti,e treasury, m addition t s a gold reserve of $ lijo.'io . .tj. a surplus of more than ?! ..') 0 ) applicable to payment of expne cf the government. and which must, uale. expecdei for that prjrpo-e. remain a useless hoard, or, if notextr-ivagactly wa-ited.must in nrxr ever.t be perverted from the purpose of its exaction from our i eople. the payment therefore, of any deficiency ia the revenue from tliis !m 1 is nothing more than its proper and :e?-.tinMtte use. It is immeasur ably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of j jstlfiabie expenses thm to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appro priations and extravagant expenditcr-s.
