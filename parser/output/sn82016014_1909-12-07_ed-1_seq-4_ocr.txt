FULL LEASED WTRE REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Th. State Journal la .mf' telegraph report ot that .great Mwaw gantzation tor inn ca.uo. . publication In Topeka T,r--The nevi la received In The State Jour nal building over wires for thla sole pur. Kansas, from one end to the other, has been covered with sleet and snow during the past couple of days. Pre sumably next year's wheat crop has been "saved" for the first time. "Why doesn't Hon. Stubbs demand more Christmas presents for the dear children, and beat Santa Clans out ot tome of his popularity?" asks the Atchison Globe. Maybe he will. There's plenty of time' yet. Evidently Governor Stubbs, William Allen White and a few others have re turned to the fold. Attorney General Jackson announced recently that "ma chine" forces are endeavoring to get him Into the congressional race In the Fourth district. If a large part of the charges made by newspapers In connection with the sugar frauds is true, it becomes evi dent fRSt Mr. Roosevelt could have had some excellent hunting for big game without leaving these shores, thinks the Wall Street Journal. President Zelaya has Ignored the note of Secretary Knox severing the diplomatic relations between the United States and "Venezuela.but he al so haa been forehanded enough to have a vessel ready for immediate flight. Apparently he Is discerning enough to see the handwriting on the wall. . If Mr. Meyer, the secretary of the navy, has his way, the United States will keep its foot well to the front in the great universal peace' movement which is so popular these days with the major nations of the earth. He would like to have congress authorize the construction of two more gigan tic battleships of the all-big gun type. The Duke of the Abruzzl is to visit the United States in the early spring for the ostensible purpose of deliver ing a series of lectures on his ascen sion of Asiatic mountains." An hon est Injun tale from him on his un successful wooing of Kitty Blkins would probably make a bigger hit plth the people of this country. If the fly is swatted out of exis tence, a leading New Tork physician declares that two years will be added to the average span ; of each human life in this country by the elimination of the transmission of disease by flies. Keep on swatting the fly then even if most of the activities in this line will have to be mind work for the next few months. Topeka merchants are urging their patrons to do their Christmas shop ping early and every one of them should take the friendly hint. Don't forget to buy Red Cross Christmas stamps, either. Each one purchased will mean another nail for the coffin which is being prepared to plant the dread tuberculosis in a final resting place. A Michigan man was sentenced re cently to five years' imprisonment for stealing a pair of shoes of the value of $1.75. Not so many days ago a number of men who were convicted In Oregon of stealing land in the pub lic domain, were let off with fines which they were quite able to - pay without embarrassment. ' Comment would appear to be unnecessary on the much talked of "equality" of law In the United States. Cotton mills in the Philippine Is lands are going to be forced to sus pend operations. The reason is as signed to the fact that the price of cotton has reached a figure in New Tork and London which makes its Importation to the Far East imprac ticable. Somebody, though, is likely to bob up with the announcement this condition of affairs has developed be cause of misrule on the part of the United States. That would be quite as sensible as many of the alleged anti-imperialistic arguments. Governor John F. Shafroth of Colo rado, told a New Tork city audience the other day that woman's suffrage will become universal In this country and right soon. That day will not be hastened, though, if women advo cates of equal rights follow the sug gestions of Mrs. Pankhurst. one of England's "militant" suffragettes. She urged them to throw stones and in dulge in the other forms of rowdyism which have placed the English enthu siasts on this subject in such an un enviable light But, then, the Ameri can women axe too sensible to follow Any such advice. THE 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. An economical . administration of governmental affairs is the key-ote of the first annual message of President Taft. Because the president has decidfi to make important matters - before the public subjects of special messages to congress today's message is disappoint ing to that extent. He reserves a num ber of big questions for special treat ment. There is but the merest mention in it of several of the most important ot the public questions which are de manding speedy solution.' These in-1 elude the matters pertaining to the anti-trust laws, the interstate com mere laws and the laws relative to the conservation of the great natural resources of the nation which have been despoiled in the past and will be despoiled in the immediate future un les3 congress soon passes remedial leg islation,. Associated with these questions are what have been termed the famous "Roosevelt policies," and the natural expectation was that Mr. Taft would take the first opportunity to deliver his opinions on them inasmuch as Mr. Roosevelt announced that he consid ered Mr. Taft better able than himself to work out the details of putting these policies in effect in an adequate and just fathion. But. although President Taft had little or nothing to say about them in his message of today, he has not forgotten them and he promises congress to handle them Individually in special messages of the future. That will no doubt be quite satisfactory, but the country was expecting a discus sion of them in the present message and their omission makes the doc ument disappointing. Even with these things eliminated, though, the message falls far short of being uninteresting. The president demonstrates that he has ideas of his own on bettering the governmental ad n4nistratlon and he is not afraid to ad vocate matters whioh he knows will be received without very much acclaim In congressional and other quarters. For instance, he calls the postal rate of one cent a pound for second class mail matter "an enormous subsidy to the newspapers, magazines and period icals" and he thinks that congress should increase this rate especially on magazines and periodicals. Presum ably Collier's Weekly will view this suggestion as an attempt on the part of President Taft and the members of his cabinet to get square with it for its attacks directly on Mr. Ballinger, the secretary of the interior, and thereby indirectly on the Taft administration. Nor will this suggestion set consistent ly with the newspapers which are so frantically opposed to governmental subsidizing of American shipbuilding They will sit up nights figuring out arguments to Insist that the loss to the government out of handling the second class mail matter which Mr. Taft places at $63,000,000 a year cannot be construed as a "subsidy" to the newspapers and the magazines as Mr. Taft says It Is. This suggestion of the president's for increasing the rate on second class mail is made for th- purpose of cutting out the annual postal deficit. He might also have suggested that aid in bring ing about such a condition of affairs could be secured through a curtailmen of the franking privilege which is in dulged in so extensively by members of congress and governmental depart ments. It is a well known fact thai this privilege is scandalously abused. And while it may be all right for gov ernment officials and government de partments to send their mail free, the expense of handling this mail should be charged to those departments and reg ular appropriations made to meet it. There is no reason why this bill should be foisted indirectly on the peo ple by asking them to make the postofflce department self-sustaining through increased postal rates. Pos sibly the second class postal rate should be increased in some instances and for the more bulky publications but there could be a paring down of the postal deficit in other ways. Another plan of the president's which will not set well with everybody calls for the establishment of a system Oi civil pensions for the support of overnmental employes who have out lived their usefulness. In advocating his plan President Taft says , he is aware that there is a strong feeling ;n congress against it and he thinks that , the same feeling .may exist throughout the country. But he points out that the' great industrial organiza tions of the country, including many cf the big railway systems, have reach- d the conclusion that a system of pensions for old employes, and the substitution therefor of younger and nore energetic servants, promotes both economy and efficiency of admin istration. He rightly thinks that simi lar plans will work out just as well with the government. He believes the clerkship service must be thoroughly reorganized if it is to become more effective and economical and he does not believe this can be done without the establishment of civil pensions. Indeed, an economical administra tion of government affairs is the key note of the entire message. President Taft says "the most important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue." Not only does he urge economy in all things, but he points out that he and his department neads are practicing it to the limit. Ihey have succeeded in cutting down estimates to such an extent that when une 30, 1911, comes around, not only will the deficit of some $34,000,000, vhlch will exist in the ordinary ex penditures of the government on June 30, 1910, be wiped out but there will l.e a surplus on hand of $36,931,000; that is if revenues come up to expecta tions, as they probably will. These figures do not take into con sideration the money being expended for the Panama canal because that is r.et by bond Issues, a plan favored by Mr. . Taft because he believes that fu ture generations should help to pay for the building of the canal. A specific instanC3 of the way economy has been practiced is to be found in the navy department, where, as Mr. Taft shows, the estimates for the year 1911 have been cut by $38,000,000 and the new naval program is limited entirely to a re quest for two new battleships and one repair ship. In cutting down govern mental expenditures in this fashion Mr. Taft is doing a great work for hi3 countrymen which will make his ad ministration a memorable one, if it dcesn't accomplish much else. Although Mr. Taft has stated that ho btlieves the woolen schedule of the tar iff law to be indefensible there will be no tariff tinkering at this session of congress if his ideas Is followed. He thinks the tariff question should be left untouched until the tariff board created by the new law has had time to do its work and get some exact information on whidh new tariff leg islation should be based. He does not think this time will arrive for two or three vears. Ship subsidies, postal savings banks, the creation of a federal bureau of health and various other matters are advocated by the president. He would also have a commission created to in vestigate the law's - delay and make suggestions for a reform of court pro cedure which will hasten the final dis position of lawsuits and cheapen their cost to litigants. r The message has a most unusual feature as presidential messages go. in that it gives a detailed report of all the buulness transacted by the state department. In its entirety it Is a document which Is well, worth any man's time and attention. There is not much in the way of thunder in it but It is full of sense. 

JOURNAL ENTRIES A horse always looks like he feels ir.ore or less Insulted when he s mtcn ea up with a mule. Nearly all of the beauty of today, especially as to feminine complexions, in not even skin deep. About the easiest way to flatter a woman is to tell her she looks several years older than she is. Most of the individuals who were rrishinsr four months ago for wintry weather are now shouting the loudest lor the good old summer time. Continuing the hunt for old fashion ed folks, what has became of the per rons who were always offering pennies lor their friends' thoughts? JAYHAWKER JOTS The Garden City Telegram recently made an inauirv as to what had be come of the old-fashioned husking bee. The Ottawa Herald does not answer the question directly but it rather clears up the mystery by remarking: Kansas farmers have more corn get a better price for it and have an all around good time without the bee." Professor Dyche, newly appointed fish and game warden, being from Law rence, where Mr. Bowersock s herd of educated catfish live, should be weil enough acquainted with catfish to know that only the dehorned kind will do well in the Arkansas river and we hop-3 he will not try to plant any of the long horned variety in the stream. Winfleld Courier. Ed Greer's twenty-fifth anniversary as editor of the Winfleld Daily Courier happened along in June but he did not think of it until the other day. Then he told of it in a modest editorial which does not have much if anything to say about the fine and honorable career of the Courier during the many years of its existence. He looks upon whatever success he has had in the past as but experience for the future and sayB: "We start, in on another twenty-five years with enthusiasm and confidence. At the end of this second period the writer will be seventy-seven years old, but he expects to be here, editing the Courier, which will then be double its present size and carrying its daily message to twenty thousand happy and prosperous citizens each evening. That's the way to talk. It breathes the spirit of the great men who have made Kansas what she is. Here's hoping tnat isa's expectations are more than fulfilled. 

QUAKER MEDITATIONS. From the Philadelphia Record. It's when a fellow is full to the brim that he is apt to talk through his hat. If a man is as young as he feels it seems a pity ' he doesn t always look it. At this time of year any one would rather be a moth than a June bug. It is quite possible for a race horse to be a chestnut without being a back number. We are told that kind words never die. At any rate, they are never talk ed to death. , A man sometimes fails because he isn't quite up to things when they are up to him. Sillicus "What becomes of love's young dream?" Cynicus "Well, it nev er dies of old age." Miss Antique "I have frequently been told that I don't look my age." Miss Caustique "Well, my dear, I dare say you never look it in the face!" 'During the past year," . remarked the patent medicine man. "I have sold 2,983,697 bottles of my consumption cure." "Tou must indeed be filling your coffers." murmured his friend. POINTED PARAGRAPHS. From the Chicago News. Try to be satisfied with the test you can get. And lots of people are too slow to make fast friends. A man can coax a woman to do anything she wants to. It's easy for a woman to paint a pretty face if she has one. We don't blame a man for growling if his wife treats him like a dog. A woman isn't necessarily level headed because her hat Is on straight. By marrying, many a man has trans formed a good friend into a poor wife. Marrying for money may Insure against divorce as long as the money lasts. REFLECTIONS OP A BACHELOR, I From the New Tork Press. 1 Income turns into outgo even before it arrives. Conscience doth make cowards of us all for fear we'll get found out. Girls know better than to love a man for any other reason than just to be in love. Some men seem to be afraid if they don't make a fuss about their meals their wives might love them. The trouble with college Is it's such a long time before the boy gets out and haa a chance to learn something. KANSAS COMMENT THE WEST AND TAFT. Samuel G. Blythe, one of the most distinguished and keenest Washing ton correspondents, has Just con cluded a tour of the United States for the Saturday Evening Post. He traveled in all of the states visited by President Taft on his recent trip and stopped at most of the cities where the president spent any con siderable amount of time. He talked with people he saw in these cities ?d on the trains and he returned to Washington with the conviction that the attitude of the west toward Taft J? t be summed up in the phrase. Hes a fine, jolly fellow, but " Mr. Blythe's views are interesting m view of certain declarations by men of more or less reputation as political observers, to the effect that Kansas, for example, Is against Taft. Mr. Blythe, who is not a Kansan, and who has no insurgent ax to grind, doesn't find Kansas so. He finds this state as he finds certain other states, kindly disposed toward the new presi dent; not enthusiastic, not loud mouthed and blatant a velt; but more than hopeful that the six months will show the stuff the people believe is in Taft. Well pleased with the president's renewed pledges, the west is not waiting for performance and if the performance is in accord with the pledges, the west will take off its coat and be for Taft with enthusiasm. That is Mr. Blythe's idea, as gathered by his ex tensive tour and it i3 wnrthv of credence, as the renort of nn ex perienced and painstaking reporter. In but One thlnr Ann 1M Plnthii fall to show his usual discernment his contrast between the old en thusiasm for Roosevelt nn1 the attT- tude of reserve and waiting toward Taft. Mr. Blythe and other ob servers should, recall that the Pnnu. yelt enthusiasm was not of Midden birth. There was a two vpbts nimmt a three years period of Incubation of the Roosevelt enthusiasm before it burst from its shell and It was not until after a considerable period of performance that it became the lusty bird we are accustomed to think of now when we recall It. Taft has been less than a year in office and he has one stupendous piece of legislation to his credit or discredit, if you choose to consider it that wnv unti i.7 he close of the long session of con gress, the people should be able to have as good an idea of the Taft per forming ability as they now have of his policies and if the performance pleases as well as the nnlicles the west will be even more enthusiasti cally for him than if was for Roose 7.?ltVfor the Taft Personality is more likable than Roosevelt's and the west already wants to bo trrr the president good and hard.

WASTE DESTROYS FORESTS. In waste alone two-thirds of the lumber that might be taken from the standing trees. At least half of this waste is unnecessary. In the first place, we waste the for ests by refusing to take aiivinia nf its full capacity for growth. Protected and properly managed, our forests will produce fai more wood than they do at present. But while it is wasteful to cripple the forest by a violent lumber ing which destroys young growth the promis-3 of the future forest it is dnn- bly wasteful to took up the forest and let the ripe timber-die and decay, for in the former case ;the forest at least contributes a temporary supply of wood whereas in the latter case it contri butes no wood at all. It is not use which destroys the for ests, but waste. Not use as such, but destructive use. combined with inex cusable neglect, is causing the forests to dwindle under our progressive de- ! mands upon them.- The problem,! therefore, is not to be solved by dis use, but by wise use and protection, i These together will so stimulate forest growth that the needed wood may be harvested without depleting the stock on hand, and will keep Intact the protective cover at the stream sources. Garden City Telegram. FROM OTHER PENS HUNGARY'S HISTORIC PARALLEL It seems that if the whirligig of time had whirled backward 60 years to read of a Hungarian crisis of which the chief personages are Francis Joseph and Kossuth. Francis Joseph is the same with this difference, that whereas in 1849 he was a lad of 19, he is now a tired but brave old man of 79. striving hard to keep two un ruly horses abreast. The Kossuth is different, being Francis. the son of the great Kossuth. Francis Kossuth, who until recently has been Hun garian minister of industry and com merce, is 68. He seems to have in herited his father's antipathy to the House of Hapsburg so far as to wel come a controversy with Francis Joseph, and has been long identified with the Independence party. The thread of similarity to his father's political course Is seen in Francis Kossuth's insistence that the word of command shall be given in the Hun garian army In Magyar and that the army shall be under, not the imperial, but the- Hungarian flag. Critics of his father have held that the latter's Insistence on the domination of Hun gary by the Magyars was his fatal political mistake that undid all the good his eloquence and energy ac complished. Austria was thereby en abled to turn the Jealousy of the other races in Hungary to Austrian ad vantage. The Magyars today are less than half the people of Hungary, yet they dominate, and to preserve their ascendancy by legislation is theli pro gram. Francis Joseph is said to have been willing to yield, but his heir pre sumptive is reported as protesting that a Hungarian -' flag, a Hungarian army and a Hungarian bank spell the dissolution of the dual monarchy. Boston Transcript. ;' A SIGN OF ACTIVITY. It is not often that the homely til can figures much In public calculations, although the American habit of using preserved foods has' made the can a very familiar article to everybody. Nevertheless, the steel trust has found It expedient to increase the steel plate $2 per ton, and its managers explain the increase as being made necessary by the enormous demand for tin cans on the Pacific coast in the fish and fruit canning industries. The uninitiated might not unnatural ly marvel at there being any connec tion between tin cans and the price cf steel plates, yet as a matter of fact steel plates enter much more largely into the composition of the tin can than does tin itself. In fact, a can has ver; little tin in its composition, that metal beine- used merely to give an outer and thin coating to the flexible steel plates which form the principal structure of the can. The fact.,however, that there is such an enormous demand for tin cans shows that business is expanding stead ily and tha' the wants of the people are Increasing. -New Orleans Picayune.

An interesting South American character, type of a civilization that has largely disappeared, died at Lima, Peru, on Monday in the person of Gen., Miguel Iglesias. He lived on an estate of 2.400 square . miles, which had been in his family since 1574, or witnin 40 years of the date of the con quest of Peru by Pizarro. There were 20.000 head of cattle on this estate and a population of about 4,000 per sons, over wnom Iglesias ruled as ab solute lord. He made and enforced their laws, provided for their educa tion and moral welfare, and never had a rebellion. Drunkenness on any day but Easter Sunday was punishable by a line of $5. , A wife-beater was pun- lsnea Dyajz fine. The fines collected largely supported the schools. It was the lifa of the feudal lords of the Middle Ages brought, down into the twentieth century- - . Gen. Iglesias took a prominent part in the government of the country, particularly at the time of the war with Chile. Ha was secretary of the treasury and of war when hostilities began. He conducted the defense of Lima in so determined a manner as to win high commendation. After the surrender he made his escape and im mediately began efforts to secure peace at any price. It was through him mainly that a treaty finally was concluded with the victorious Chil eans. He was elected provisional president of the country, but ; his rule was disputed by Gen. Andes Caceres, who headed the party which wished to continue the war. A civil conflict be tween Iglesias and Caceres resulted in which Iglesias was defeated. He retired for a time to Europe, but later returned to his estate, which he rarelj left thereafter even to attend the ses sions of the congress, of which he wa a member. He was 87 years old when ne cuea. tJurraio Express. An Obscure Benefactor. Many men receive extended obitu ary notice who deserve it far less than did a modest and unpretentious Meth odist minister who died in England a few days ago. The name of William Henry Dallinger has not been greatly trumpeted about, but it was borne by a man who is entitled to be ranked among those scientists of the past generation who contributed materially and much toward the ascertainment of truth, and especially of that truth which, is of greatest fascination and importance, the origin and nature of life. ; r ... . Dallinger became specially inter ested in this subject about 40 years ago.when the old controversv over spontaneous generation was revived. with Bastian and Tyndall as opposing protagonists, taking the places which Pouchet and Pasteur had respectively filled a few years- before. While he stood in the background his researches and observations were of inestimable advantage to Tyndall, and. Indeed, to all scientists.' both in the direct re sult of his laboratory work and also in the great impetus which ho gave to the improvement of microscopic lenses. His painstaking investigations which extended through many years, confirmed in the most convincing manner the conclusions of Pasteur and Tyndall, that spontaneous genera tion was a myth, and that all life must come from preexisting life. It was Pasteur's demonstration of that fact which inspired and enabled Lister to establish antiseptic surgery. From the reaffirmation of it by Tyn call, and equally by Dallinger, has proceeded our whole system of an tibacterial sanitation and therapeutics, And every triumph of mosquito net ting over yellow fever and malaria, of the water boiler and filter over cholera and typhoid, and . of the rat trap over bubonic plague, proclaims the vast benefits to the human race which have accrued from the pains taking labors of these searchers after truth. New York Tribune. Faith In Witchcraft. Last August a coroner at Reading, Pa., in investigating the cases of six infants who had died in the same neighbornooa, round tnat In every case parents had imagined that the children were "verhexed" and had called in a witch doctor to drive away the evu. At Butler, Pa., a few months before, a woman was charged in court by a neighbor with being a witch an.1 cast ing a spell over a cow, thus prevent ing it from giving milk. The testi mony indicated something had been done to the animal, so disorderl con duct was made the technical charge cn which to base a short jail sentence. S. Baring-Gould in one of his books tells of several comparatively recent cases where the Cornish people of his parish believed that certain old wom en had "overlooked" the cows of neighbors and spoiled their milk." In Cuba within the last five years there have been several cases, one only last spring, where reputed witches among the negroes were con victed of murdering a white baby in order to procure the heart and blood with which to heal the sick. Faith in brujeria or witchcraft is by no means uncommon throughout the island. Not many years ago an authentic case was recorded where a party of Navajo Indians in New Mexico stoned to death a squaw of their own tribe whom they accused of being a witch and causing a spell over other squaws. So long as human nature Is what it is there probably will always be peo ple capable of believing in the old way that jaundice becomes incurable if a yellow-legged chicken' flies over the patient, but is cured by looking into black axle grease.

EVENING STORY ' , RemoTiiu; Sarah Jane. -(By Lawrence Alfred' Clay.) ' "No, it - wouldn't do--lt wouldn't do 'tall. Sarah Jane don't like her. and she'd just raise old Cain about It. I'm old enough to know what I want, and to run my own business, but Sarah Jane has got ways with her. She might even put poison in my tea if she thought I was going to do it" It was Deacon Meeks. owner of the sawmill in the village of Plalnfleld. and a widower of three years stand ing, who was thus soliloquizing one afternoon as Vi . - ..j. side the mill The deacon was fifty- ?Jytarir ,old and hls sister, Sarah Jane, had kept house for him since "w iem aione.

" was the widow Johnson whom tne deacon had in minri when h. m was ,n love wlth her. and reit that his affections .were returned. She was nearly his age and a much respected woman. Sarah Jane heard of the liking they had for each other, and she took both nrinphoi. i about it. She could outtalk the widow and outshout her brother, and so she nipped things in the bud. In the lan guage of the deacon when he went uver to see tne wirtow "Widder Johnson. I'm 9.q xrif o that I've taken a great shine to you, and I don't care who knows it: but vou see how I'm situated with ah Jane. If she Was removed TM have something to say to you mighty quick, but as it is we've got to hang on and wait." The widow didn't say much that was consoling in reply, and the dea con went away hating himself for his lacit or moral courage. One day he would make ud his mind to marrv and give Sarah Jane the bounce, and me next ne wouia sniver at the way the dishes would be broken and the furniture destroyed. He was a good man, but he found himself wonder ing why his sister didn't get pneu monia or slip on the doorstep and break her neck. Once the thought of choking her to death and carrying her body away in a bag entered his mind, but he sternly dismissed it. He did, however, scatter rusty nails and broken glass in the back yard. Sarah Jane was a great hand to go bare foot, and a piece of glass or a nail in her foot might be harmful. She continued to stroll about as usual, and notning- nappened. As- the weeks went by a stranger came to Plalnfleld selling a magic liniment, it cured everything while you waited. He was a bald-headed, hump-backed man, and he seemed lonely and with little to live for. He had had sorrows, as he confided to Deacon Meeks after vainly trying to Sell him a bottle of the magio. He had loved and been thrown down hard, and he never expected to love again. Besides selling magic liniment this man could sing. This was the dea con's cue. Sarah Jane loved a singer. She just doted on a man who could carry through the song of "The Old Oaken Bucket" without more than three or four breaks. He was Invited to the house to supper, and he sang for Sarah Jane. She was captivated and laid herself out to be . agreeable. That evening the deacon walked a distance with the singer and finally asked: Would you marry again if you found the right kind of a woman?" "I don't feel financially able to sup port a wife," was the reply.. "But if it so happened that you were to fall in love with my dear sis ter, on the one hand I should hate to lose her. and on the other I should feel it my duty to present you with well, say a couple of hundred dol lars. That Is, if you were going to take her off to California at once." "Thanks, but I couldn't do it. I am selling magic liniment, but am not in the sida-show business. "I might say three hundred." "It would be useless. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but the place for Sarah Jane is in a dime mu seum." I The deacon had been turned down, but - a new idea had lodged in his cranium. The way to get rid of his sister was to marry her off. He felt resentful toward the liniment man for not accenting his offer. Such a man as that had no right to pick and choose. No matter about Sarah Jane s looks, three hundred dollars was bie- offset. The stranger was to have left the next day but he didn't. He planned to sleep in a barn the second nignt and save expense.
