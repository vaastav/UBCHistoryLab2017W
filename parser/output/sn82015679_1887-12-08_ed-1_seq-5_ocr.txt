THE ESTDIANAPOIilS JOURNAL, .THURSDAY, DECEAIBBU 8, 18S7. fasturers will bedeeeired by plitterine frenerali ties. The next campaign will ba the battle be tween protection and free-trade, with the chances lareelr in favor of the Republicans. St. Lonis Republican (Dem.): Mr. Randall most fall in or fail oat. He can do either he pleases, bnt he must do one or the other. New York Commercial Advertiser (Reo.): It la a plain, frank, definite proposition, and comes lifce a fresb breeze in a sultry day. It sweeps away cant, lifts od a banner and challenges to combat It will have a decisive weight in the f ntnre of parties and of legislation. -Terre Haute Express: If Mr. Cleveland had fossessed the least bit of foresight he would are expressed himself on the tariff question two years a?o. Then was the time for his party In the House to do something with the tariff, be fore the surplus accumulated iu the treasury. Chicago Tribune: The message is able and statesmanlike; luminous in style; perspicuous in statement; ciear in it reasoning; and irrefutable in its conclusions. It is moderate protection Hoc trine such as has been exemplified more than once in the public utterances of both the great political parties. The Post (Ind.): The message is the most courageous document that has been sent from the executive mansion since the close of the war. It will compel public discussion in Con gress. It wul supply parties with an issue that they have long needed. We bave no doubt the President's party will sustain him. Lafayette Courier: The President says, "Our frogress towards a wise conclusion will not be mproved by dwelling upon the theories of pro lection and free trade, which savors too much of bandying epithets," and then proceeds to do precious little else than expound theories and auggest remedies that are impracticable even It ova his stand-point. Lafayette Call: Mr. Cleveland's message is a bouquet of glittering generalizations for cam paipn effect. It may, and probably does, mean nothine. It is devoid of practical recommenda tion. But if it imports a forced general -'eduction in prices of all kinds of manufactured eoods, hen "look out!" The wise business man, in juch case, will prepare for a storm indeed. Chicago News: There is no partisanship, no free trade, no appeal to class prejudice, no special hobby, in the President's message. It is plain, patriotic, common sense from opening to close. He has done well in confining it to the one subject of tariff reform. His action must . focus public attention upon the necessity of a systematic reduction of the tariff - without prejudice and without favor. Chicago Herald (Dem.): There is no taint of Handallism in its preparation. He would not bave internal taxation disturbed, but recom mends a revision of vicious tariff laws whereby revenue may be reduced to the extent of the surplus. The free list should be enlarged, and duties upon raw materials used in domestic manufactures should be diminished. Wool is fpeeifically mentioned, with felicitous illustra tion of the ill-eilects and altogether illusory ben efits of maintaining high duties upon this staple. . Cbicaeo Evening Journal: The President's argument in favor of tariff reduction is vigorous in style. But it is unsound as a matter of logic, and its conclusions are refuted by millions of facts. He makes the declaration, no longer re peated in free-trade newsoapers, that the tariff promotes the formation of trusts. There is no tariff on gas; there is no tariff on bard coal; there is no tariff on block tin; there is no tariff on quinine; there is no tariff on coffee. Yet in each of these commodities there bave been trusts, syndicates and rings formed, to control the quantity of the out-put, and to regulate the price. Some of these trusts are of foreign origin, and have usurped control of our market because there is no tariff toexclode them. Chicago Inter Ocean: Over and over again does the President say "bnt still," or "yet,n r something else that is - provisional, "the interests of American labor and American capital must not suffer in this revision of tariff," but be always says it after a paragraph of vigor ens insistence on great reduction of tariff. He peaks of the present tariff as "a vicious, in--equitable, and illegal source of needless reve nue." If it be this, It is certainly a thing to be radically- changed; and. despite of all his quali fying clauses as to "the interests of labor," it is radical ebange that be desires. The Pres ident has issued a free-trade pamnblet in which no argument is educed that has not been used by all the Cobden Club organs till it has become tale and threadbare. Louisville Courier-Journal (Dem.): To our friends, Colonel McClure. of the Philadelphia Times, and Colonel Colyar, of the Nashville American, greeting: Together with the cordial invitation. "Come in out of the wet." , And bow do you like the President's message, ! anyhow? He is evidently willing to commit the fortunes of bis whole administration to tbe pol icy which be nrges. Is ic to be a successfully executed policy or not? Who among Demo crats says not? Are our Rand alii te friends of . Nashville and Philadelphia with ns or against us in the fight for this policy? What do you say, gentlemen? We have been stabbed and disabled eo often by your allies while we were attempting to carry out policies of tariff reduction far less radical than this that we should like to know bow to place you this time. Can you give an honest and. unambiguous answer? Cincinnati Commercial Gazette: President Cleveland's message is a free-trade deliverance out and ont, through and through, without any mitigating conditions. The President and the party he represents are free-traders. They want the internal revenue system, which is a war measure, maintained in order that an argument in favor of free trade may be pre sented in order that American industries may be oppressed by reducing the duty on foreign productions. Protection is not in tbe Interest of monopoly. American protectionists nre not monopolists. The policy is to equalize foreign and homa labor. This is the object of protection. Mr. Cleveland's object is to reduce home labor to that of foreign pauper wages. This would not be admitted; nevertheless it is the fact, and upon this issue the Republican party is quite wijling to go before the country. St. Louis Globe-Democrat (Rep.): So far as it outlines a policy at all, however, it presents the policy which the great majority of the Demo cratic party favors. To this extent tbe message is open, candid and commendable. It advocates the retention of tbe internal taxes in their pres ent form, and favors making tbe reduction of ibe surplus bear on customs duties alone. This gives the country fair notice of the designs of the Democracy, and tells tbe people what to ex pect if the dominant party should prove powerful enough to crystallize its purposes into law. THE 

SOUTHERN PRESS. New Orleans Times-Democrat: "The mes sage sent yesterday by the President to Con gress is unique. It is, first of all, the shortest presidential message ever sent, and is confined wholly to a. single subject the tariff. The President declares himself in no uncertain terms a revenue reformer and opposed to pro tection pure and simple. He would have Con gress leave the internal revenue alone and con centrate itself on the work of reducing the tariff. We do not agree with the President in regard to the non-reduction of the tobacco tax. It is true that tobacco is not a necessity, but the taxis troublesome and burdensome to the agricultural, producer, and the cost of its collection is consid erable." Charleston (S. C.) News and Courier: "The President exposes with cruel courtesy every fal lacy of tbe protective argument. Indeed, a stronger or more comprehensive exposition of the weakness and inherent inequality of the protective system has not been given to the public. Through it alt, moreover, there runs a vein of kindly sympathy and patriotic consider ation. The manufacturer or the workingman who reads this message must be callous and sus picious indeed, if be is not impressed by it with the abiding conviction that a readjustment of the tariff which should be committed to the President, if that were practicable, would leave tbe workingman in better position than that which be cow holds, would increase the general prosperity of manufacturers and tbe persons whom they employ, in opening to Americans the markets of the world, and would at tbe same time, by diminishing the bnrdens and restraints upon them, augment the comfort of every man, woman and child in the land." Atlanta Constitution: "Tbe message of tbe President concerns itself solely with the tariff question, and he discusses it almost exclusively from the stand-point of Brer Bill Morrison, of Illinois, who was left at home by bis esteemed constituents on account of his extreme views. At tbe same time tbe President does not go as far as Brer Bill Morrison. He pauses in the les son which be gives to Congress to refer to tbe fact that the Democratic platform suggests pro tection for American industries and American labor. There is one fact, however, to which Mr. Cleveland fails to call attention namely, that the promises of the Democratic platform can be carried out by the repeal of the internal revenue law. which was framed to suit an emergency long since passed, and which, in its operation, is cdions and unjust. The repeal of this law would to effectually do away with the surplus that Congress would be compelled to revise tbe tariff with such protection as the Chicago platform calls for, but the free-traders are op poed to this repeal for the reason that while ihe revenue tax is levied any attempt to reduce tbe tariff will merely result in increasing the lurplus, and they will therefore have an excuse !or putting their free-trade notions into effect to tome extent. That a man of practical common lense like Cleveland should walk into such a trap is surprising, but he has not walked into it without a protest, as his reference to the Chicago platform shows." Geo. Goeblin, who murdered Caroline Scbenf- f?rt atBreslau, L i. Oct. 8. by shooting her nd running her through with a sabre, has been pronounced insane by a medical commission, ind will be sent to the Hudson River Asyhim. 

SOME PROBLEMS OF THE DAY Important Questions Under Discussion by the General Christian Conference. TroL Bojesen Talks Yirorouslj of Immigra tion Evils, and Bishop Hurst and Dr. Pier son Discuss the Church and the Masses. Washington, Dec 7. A general Christian conference under the auspices and direction of the Evangelical Allianee for the United States, opened in this city this morning. The Congre gational Chureh, in which the conference met, and which is one of the largest in Washington, was completely filled when President Dodge called the meeting to order and briefly stated the reasons which led to the gathering and the results hoped for. The Alliance, he said, had thoughtfully studied the social and economic changes in the country, and sought to know whether existing Christian organizations were sufficient to meet growing nbeds. He referred to the organized power of the saloons, and said the church had lost its hold on the workingmen. Everywhere among them is unrest and a look ing for higher good. This means a grand oppor tunity for an applied Christianity. He said this gathering was called that facts may be presented, and a conference held as to the opportunity and the responsibility. At tbe conclusion of President Dodge's ad dress the Hon. John Jay. of New York, spoke at length. The discussion of the subject was continued by Rev. Dr. J. S. McPterson, of Chicago. The attendance at the afternoon session was very large, and many persons who were unable to find seats remained standing in the aisles. Ex-Justice Strong, of tb6 United States Su preme Court, who presided, said that there had never been a time when such a rallying and uniting of all that is best in the Christian church was more imperatively needed than now. He introduced Prof. Hjalmer H. Boyesen, of Colom bia College, who made a short address upon the subject of immigration. The Constitution of the United States, he said, was framed by men of Anglo-Saxon origin, for their own gov ernment, and pre-supposes the long polit ical evolution to which that race has been subjected. To pre-suppose such Anglo-Saxon virtues as moderation, self-restraint and sense of fair play of those not hav ing such antecedents is absurd. Immigration, which draws from the lower strata of Europe, is changing the character of the people, and gradu ally eliminating the virtues which are indispens able to successful self-government. A change has come over the spirit of the immigrant, owing to the tact that he does not improve his lot as much as formerly by immigration. "The Social ists and the Anarchists come to avenge here what they, suffered in Europe. By their dis loyal sentiments and hostility to American insti tutions they disorganize and weaken the state. The third estate (the industrial class) is tbe gov erning class in this country. But now the fourth estate the manual laborers who for merly framed no political demands has raised its head, . and has begun to eon test with the third estate the directing power in this country. Hence arise discontent and social and economic convulsion. The speak er, though regretting this transfer of power, did not see bow, with universal suffrage and unre stricted immigration, it was to be averted. He believed that the time has arrived when our former policy of indiscriminate absorption of foreign elements of population would result in a serious crisis. The Nation no longer is able to assimilate the alien elements with sufficient rapidity. Tbe children of aliens make a terrible exhibit in the statistics of pauperism and crime. They constitute largely the hoodlums and roughs of our citis. The public scnools bava intoxicat ed men with a sense of independence without im -pressing upon them the responsibilities of lib erty. The employers of labor, he said, are able to defeat strikes by means of immigration. More competition witn American labor enters in a week throuen Castle Garden than the prisons turn out in a year. Pro tection to American labor is a farce as long as this unbarred flood-gate remains open. Immi gration has the effect of lowering the grade of American civilization by introducing an undue competition with people who demand less of life. He bad known Hungarians who saved money on wages of $1 a dav. They changed tbeir linen once a month and picked their din ners out of ash-barrels. Competition with such people was impossible for self-respecting labor ers. People who live like pig also presently be have like pigs. Prof. Boyesen said, in conclu sion, that he was in favor of a law which would make consular inspection and a certificate of good character indispensable prerequisites to immigration practically such a law, in fact, as is proposed by Senator Palmer. A general discussion followAd. in the course of which Mr. L. L. Baldwin, of Boston, said that a law requiring consuls to eertify to the good character of all immigrants might be a very good thing, but the exclusion of a Chinaman as a Chinaman "is an abomination." He did not believe in the free admission of such foreigners as those who mobbed tbe Chinese at Rock Springs, and the exclusion of such Chinese as those who were the victims of that outrage. Bishop Hurst. LL. D.. of Buffalo, addressed the members of the Alliance noon "The Estrange ment of the Masses of the Church." He said in substance: The American church has never provided either pastors or churches sufficient to supply the spiritual needs of our people. The causes of tbe estrangementof the people is the an tagonism of the foreigners to our evangelical life. We committed a crime when we prohibited the immigration of the Chinaman, and only did it because be had no vote. The Sunday newspa per aids in the alienation of the people, because the latter imagine they have in it a substitute for the gospel. Through our spiritual neglect of the foreigner, we ground out the Anarchist. Sabnath desecration is also powerful in alienat ing the people, and the curse of the saloon, per haps, is the most potent of all. Women should be called by the church to a larger pl.ee in its ministrations, and more laymen should be brought in. We are only touching the people witft the tips of our fingers. The habit of leav ing the down-town population to be tbe devil's flock is a monstrosity. There is no apology for such conduct. Let the millions of gold be re leased from the saloon, and the world would be reclaimed in one decade. Rev. Arthur T. Pierson, D. D., pastor of the Bethany Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, continued the discussion of the same subject, and said that the tendency of tbe rich is to get as far as they can from the unwholesome and disagreeable surroundings of the poor. "I found in New York," he said, "eighteen women and children, white and colored, occupying one room. This blinded Samson of ignorant and unevangelized labor may get his arms around the pillars supporting our commonwealth and bring it down." He told of the daughter of Lord Peel, who rode out with him in a splendid babit made by a poor seamstress in a garret, and who caught from it a typhoid fever which laid her under ground in ten days. As soon as a district begins to be known as a poor one, the churches move out toward the avenues. The churches seem to the poor like express trains made up entirely of Pullman oars, and no wonder. The speaker deprecated the new system, and said it was a most potent means of j preventing true fellowship in the church. "Give us," be said, "tbe worship of God and not of the architect; the convenience and not the incon venience of tbe audience, and make all thor oughly cordial and home-like, and we will have no trouble in overcoming the present estrange ment of the masses. Tbe absolute equality of all relations explains tbe great power of that system in concerting and holding the poor." The church was crowded at tbe evening ses sion, which was presided over by Senator Col quitt, of Georgia. Tbe first paper read was by Bishop Coxe, of Buffalo, N. Y., on "Ultra montanism." He said that if be were a Roman Cathoiio bishop he should impress Gallicanism instead of Ultramontanism on his followers. Ultramontanism was simply Jesuitism. "Let ns be Roman Catholics." he said, "but let us at tbe same time be Americans, and the Jesuit can not be an American, because he owes allegiance to a foreign potentate. Tbe Jesuits, for that reason, had been expelled from all nations, Clement the XIV himself suppressing them as a menace to tbe church. The Ameri can Roman Catholics." he continued, "should demand of Rome tbe same privileges which are granted to French Catholics. No American priest should be compelled to cross the ocean to answer to an Italian court. American Catho lics should say to Rome. 4 You shall net interfere with this country's questions, agrarianism or labor troubles.' " The Rev. J.- M. King, of tbe board of man agers, delivered an address showing the differ ence between Roman Catholicism and Jesuit ism. R. S. MacArthnr, D. D.. pastor of the Cal vary Baptist Church, of New York', read a paper entitled the "Saloon." The saloon, he said, is useless and bnrtfut. wielding for evil purposes polities! power and wealth. Murder is one of its weapons. It is in alliance with anarchy. . It antagonizes the church of God, the Bible and the Lord's day. He assailed the "Personal Liberty" party, which he declared takes the linguistic livery of heaven with which to serve the deviL The day's proceedings closed with an address by the Rev. A. , G. Haygood, of Georgia, on education in the South and the need of more public schools. A NEW 

SWINDLING SCHEME. Arrest of a Ma Who Raised a Postoffice Money Order from $1 to $80. The recent telephone swindle by which several hotel cashiers throughout the country paid out sums running from $30 to $150, had hardly ceased to be a matter of news before the shrewd confidence men put in operation another scheme. It was not quite as ingenious or novel as an order through a" telephone for the cashier to oblige a guest by paying for a valuable pack age that would be left for him at the hotel, but it was as successf uL , A man of good address and a well-filled grip would register at a hotel, and in a day or two after impressing the clerks and cashiers with his style, would ask the favor of having a postal order cashed. The cashiers of the Leland at Cleveland, the Sherman at Chicago, and the Arlington at Washington, were among those who favored guests iu this manner. They shortly found that the orders had been raised from 3 to $30 or from $1 to $80. As the discoveries came too late, no arrests were made until Joseph Esrhardt, ostensibly from Louisville, came to grief at the Bates House. He arrived here Saturday evening with the air of a traveling man of sonieg importance. Nobody thought of "questioningns honesty until 4 o'clock yesterday morning, when Captain Campbell came to the ; hotel to arrest him. The officer, accompanied by Harry Thompson, the book-keeper of J. R. Ross & Co., and Mr. Cun ningham, a clerk of the hotel, knocked at Ear hardt's room, and said that a gentleman wanted to see him. Earhardt opened the door and be came pale at sight of the officer, who told him that he was wanted for attempting to pass a forged check. "I had no forged check," hastily said Earhardt. . , "But you had a raised postoffice money or der." "That is the man," said the book-keeper, and after that Earhardt had nothing to say. ne was taken to the station-house, and a few hours latter appeared before Commissioner Van Buren, who remanded him to jail in default of $1,000, to await the action of the grand jury. Earhardt went to J. R. Ross & Co.'s house Monday, and representing himself as the partner of Dan Fasig, of Terre Haute, presented a letter of introduction to Major Ross from that person. Earhardt said he wanted to buy a par ticular brand of cigars, and the goods being set aside and the bill for $25 made out, he gave a postoffice order for $80 in payment, requesting $15 in cash and a check for $40. Major Ross, thrown off his guard by the letter of introduc tion, and the address of the young man, as sented to his arrangement. Returning to the hotel, he asked cashier Silsby to cash the check, but he was referred to Mr. Reibold. who advised him to yait until morning and have the check paid in at bank. Earhardt made no further at tempt to procure ready money, and a few hours later he was arrested. In making up his ,cash Monday evening. Mr; Thompson saw that 'the postoffice order had been raised. The postoffice was then closed, and the' inoney-order . .clerk could not be found until 11 - o'clock that night He, with Mr. Thompson, looked up the letter. of advice, which showed that the order for $1 Vas issued Saturday, in Terre Haute, payable", to "James Goodman, No. 834 Main street, Indian apolis." In his room at the Bates House, a blot ter found on the floor presented a reproduction of the figures and letters on the order after it had been raised. He also had among his effects letter heads of various firms in different parts of the country, and papers showing that he had assed under the names of J. F. Pierce, J. T. avis and S. J. Clements. Earhardt will give no account of himself, ex cept to say that "he has an aged father and mother from whom he wishes to keep any knowledge of his trouble. He thinks a lawyer, when he secures one. will be able to defend him successfully after the prosecution has made out its case. CHARGED WITH FALSE PRLTEXJSE& f- Orville n. Albro Arrested for Obtaining $500 on Statements That Were Not True. Orville H. Albro, a book-binder, formerly in the employ of W. B. Burford, was arrested on a warrant from 'Squire Johnson's court yesterday, charging him with obtaining money under false pretenses. The plaintiffs in the case are Sam uel C. Seaton. and William A. Ford. The spe cific charge made against Albro is that recently he went to Seaton and represented that he was the half owner of the American paper-box fac tory, situated at the corner of New York and Alabama streets, and proposed to sell his interest for $800. He represented that there was no in cumbrance on the property, and that the en tire indebtedness of the firm amounted to but $300. On his representations. Mr. Seaton pur chased his interest in the factory, and paid him $800 cash. When Mr. Seaton went to take pos session of his interest in the factory, he found that it was mortgaged for $5fl0 in favor of Wm. A. Ford, the owner of the other half interest. Albro refused to refund the money, and the warrant for his arrest was sworn out by Mr. Ford. He gave bond for his appearance for trial Saturday at 9 o'clock. GREEN SMITH'S ASPIRATIONS. He States that ITe Is a Candidate for the Dem ocratic Nomination for Governor. Green Smith has decided to ask the Democrats to nominate him for Governor. He says that he does not expect any help from the politicians, and thinks himself able to get along without them. "It will do me no good to take the tail of the ticket," he said, "no matter who is nomi nated, for there is nothing in the Lieutentant governorship except a bare chance of succession. I cannot afford to take' that chance, for if I am not nominated for Governor it will be more profitable for me to stay out of politics."5 "Had Judge Turpi ' returned home, what then?" he was asked. "nad he not been seated in the Senate he would have been nominated for Governor. With him I would have taken the second place on the ticket, but with no other." "How about Senator Voorhees and Mr. Mc Donald?'' "If either one is to be a candidate for the nom ination I am out of the $ace. If the race is to be between men of my age and experience, then I am an aspirant for the office."

SCIENCE IN FEUIT-EAISING Distinguished Horticulturists Attend ing the Indiana Society's Meeting. Interesting Discussions on Questions Relat ing to the Growth of Fruits Election of Officers for Next Year. The attendance at the session of the Indiana Horticultural Society yesterday morning was large, notwithstanding tbe unpleasant weather. There are a number of distinguished horticult urists and botanical scientists in attendance. Prof. T. J. Burriil. of the Illinois Industrial University, at Champaign, Til., is a man who appears tbe ideal philosopher, except that his beard and hair are black. His forehead ishieh, his head bald on top, hia beard f ulL Prof. J. C. Arthur, of Purdue, is a man ' who looks young for his reputation. He wears a heavy black mustache, with a small imperial and abbreviat ed side whiskers- He was formerly connected with the New York experimental station. H. E. Van Deman, the United States pomologist. is a middle-aged man, a strong, fine looking man, with black hair, mustache and chia whiskers. He is a Kansas man and has been well known in pomological work for a. number of years. President J. M. Smith of the Wisconsin Society, is a man pa3t middle age, with a pleasant, intelligent face. " nis hair and beard are quite gray. He conducts one of the most productive fruit farms in tbe country, at Green Bay, and looks more like a bank president than a frnit farmer, not that he would be suspected of having any designs on Canada, but from bis well-kept appearance and dignified bearing Nicholas Ohmer, ex-president of tbe Ohio Horticultural Society, is a rather small, wiry man. past middle-age. His hair and full beard are deeply tinged with gray, but his activity has evidently not been impaired by age. He and bis brother George are widelv known as the proprietors of a number of railroad restaurants, iricla ding one at the Union Depotin this citv. He resides near Dayton, O ,on bis splendid fruit farm of 104 acres, where he has six or seven thousand frnit trees, in addition to a great deal of small fruit. Prof. R. H. Warder, of North Rend, O., was to have presented a paper on "Forestry." but as be was absent the society took up the first hour of the session in revising the fruit list. Prof. J. C. Arthur, of Purdue, was then intro duced, and read a paper on "Fungicides and Their Application." He said that until lately sulphur bad been the common substance used for killing all sorts of f unei. but it was not de structive to all of them. It is beneficial only for surface mildews, and not all of them. It is used chiefly in this region in hot-houses. The best method of using it is to paint tbe hot-air pipes with a mixture of sulphur and linseed-oil. The evaporated sulphurous acid gas destroys the fungi. Sulphate or copper ia a valuable fungi cide. A solution of one pound in twenty gallons of water, sprinkled on the plants, will be found very beneficial. Sulphate of iron has bad some reputation, but it ia probably not eo good as sulphate of copper. Hyposulphite of soda, in solution of less than one pound to ten gallons of water, is beneficial for tbe fnnei of apple and pear trees. Sulphide of potassium, in solution of a quarter of an ounce to a rallon of water, has been found useful for several fruits. Hon. W. H. Ragan paid a hieh compliment to tbe work of Professor Arthur in this line. Pro fessor Burriil added that more attention should be paid to fungi, as much fruit might be saved iby so doing. This was especially true as to bagging grapes. Professor v an ueman urgea the importance of bagging grapes at as early a .stage as possible. By request, J. M. Smith, or vv isconsin, reaa a brief paper on tbe advisability of horticulture by farmers generally. He traced the history of two ideal families, one of which farmed without fruit and the other with fruit. The pictures were very cleverly drawn, and. of course, showed health, happiness and prosperity to the fruit family, with discomfort, despair and final abandonment of farm life by the children of tbe farmer without fruit. It was received with much applause and a unanimons vote of thanks. At the afternoon session the first paper beard was Prof. F. M. Webster's on "Parasites and Insecticides. ,r He said that the immense army c parasites stand as a bulwark between th horticulturist and his insect foes. The most destructive insects are those of foreign origin which have probably been brought here without bringing their parasites with them. These parasites feed on the bodies of insects and cause their death. There are two classes of them. The first lay their eggs in the bodies of the victims. The second catch and devour them The principal ones of the first class are the ichneumon flies, ege parasites, and cbalcididac. Tbe second includes a long list of different families. Here Professor Web ster described a large number of these parasitic insects, and made mention of their habits. The most popular insecticides are of an arsenical nature and are applied either in solu tion or in powder. The most popular poisons are paris green, London pur ple and white .arseric When applied in powder it i3 better to mix with floor, as the dew causes it to adhere to the plant. Paris green, if applied in powder, should be mixed, one ponnd with fortv pounds of flour. In solu tion, one pound to eighty to one hundred gal lons of water should be used. Tbe plants should be sprinkled only, not drenched. London purple and white arsenic should be used similarly, but only about half as strong. These poisons should not be used on plants the foliaee of which is used for food, or on frnit which is approaching full growth. Kerosene emulsions, white helle bore, whale-oil soap, lime and sulphur are also beneficial, especially as against squash-bugs, chinch-bugs and some others which poisons will not kill. The committee on honorary members recom mended the election of J. M. Smith, of Wiscon sin: H. E. Van Deman, of Washington, D. C; Prof. T. J. Burriil, of Illinois, and N. Ohmer, of Ohio, ' as honorary members, which was adopted. B. C. Hobbs addressed the society on the im portance of cultivating flowers as well as fruits and vegetables. He urged especially the culti vation of native plants. After considerable mis- -cellaneous talk by various members, the election of officers was taken up. It resulted as follows: President Dr. Allen Furnas, of Danville. ' Secretary C. M. Hobbs, of Bridgeport. Treasurer Daniel Cox, of Cartersburg. Vice-presiJents W. A. Workman, of Greencastla; G. W. Mcintosh, of Rego; Dr. Cornett, of Madison; J. C. Stevens, of Richmond; Or. W. Grant, of Pulaski, and I. D. G. Nelson, of Fort Wayne. Executive Committee W. H. Ra?an, of Greencas tle: E. Y. Teas, of Dunreith, and Prof. J. Troop, of Lafayette. After the installation of tbe officers W. IL Ragan was introduced and read a paper on "Neglected American Fruits." He sketched the history of fruit-erowing from the early days when tbe only cultivated fruits were of Euro pean origin, down to the present. The Ameri can crab-apple, tbe paw-paw, tbe persimmon, the 'service-berry, the huckleberry, and ' the mulberry were mentioned as native fruits which would almost certainly repay cultivation. In addition to its frnit be said the mulberry was valuable for its wood, and gave as an instance of its durability the fact that the famed "catal pa posts," of which General Harrison made the stockade at Vineennes, were really mulberry. Tbe evening session was opened with Prof. John M. Coulter's paper on "Fertilization of Plants." He said that the subject, a'.tboueh probably of no direct practical importance to the horticulturist, should be very interesting, as it has to do with those changes in the ripening of fruits which are of vital interest to him. A few years aeo the subject of fertilization was treated in a mostbazy way because the facts were not known. Observations had to b made upon ob jects either opaque, or so transparent that no form was discoverable. The last few years bave brought reagents which render tbe opaque trans parent, and which color tne invisible parts and bring them out to view as distinctly as a colored map. This has opened up a new world in bot any, and tbe revelations have been greater in no subject than in tbe hidden facts of fertilization. It is now known that the pollen grain (tbe male principle) is two-celled, one cell being devoted to the development of a pollen tube, the other to the fertilizing act. When the pollen falls on the pistil, its tube beeins to develop and penetrate tbe tissues of the pistil, growing like a parasite and living off the juices of its host until it reaches the ovary cavity. There, in tbe embryo-sac, it finds an ege- apparatus ready to receive it. The act of fertilization is found to consist, not in the flowing together of the protoplasm of pollen tube and embryo-sac, but in tbe blending of tbe male and female nuclei which this protoplasm carries. Tbe re sult is the development of the embryo. Ferti lization not only results in tbe formation of an embryo, but sets in operation those processes which result in the ripening of the fruit- Close fertilization is where pollen- acts upon a pistil in the same flower. Oross-fertiliza-tion is where the pollen acts upon a pistil of a different flower, but of the same species. Nature abhors the former, but dslights in the latter, because she dislikes varieties. Horti culturists prefer close fertilization and are al ways at war with nature, for varieties are their stock in trade. However, as close fertilization is simply "breeding in aud in." the stock soon de teriorates, and hence horticulturists' varieties are running out and have to be replaced by oth ers. Hybridizing is the crossing of species. The question is being discussed, whether, in crossing varieties, the pollen of the male had any power to impart some of its characters to the immediate crop. The fact was demonstrated in the case of corn, and perhaps in gourd fruits, but in other cases was still very uncertain. Presumption was against it, but the operations of horticulturists must be looked to to settle it. Prof. James Sanders, of Westfield, was then heard on "Grapes." His paper was devoted to a presentation of a series of tests of different kinds of grapes in central Indiana. The best grape he bad found, considering all points, was the "Moore's Early," with possibly the excep tion of the "Concord." "Brighton," "Warden," "Golden Pocklington," were also recommended as very valuable varieties for this region. The Ulster Prolific was well spoken of. , The best place to cultivate grapes is trained on a build ing; next best, on the south side of a tight board fence; next, a tree; next a trellis; last on the ground. Vines should be pruned late in the fall, laid on the ground, and covered with earth or straw. It pays to bag high-priced varieties of grapes. It does not cost to exceed one cent per pound, and the quality is improved, and tbe grapes are protected from birds and from rot tine. ... Sylvester Johnson thought tbe Ulster Prolific was one of the best grapes for this region. B. C. Hobbs said a neighbor of his had been investi gating the rotting of grapes, and found it was due to an insect layine an egg in them. He protects them by bagging. He thought that tbe higher grapes grew the better they were, and the finest he bad ever seen grew in tree tops. Con siderable discussion followed as to the relative merits of white and red grapes. The great ma jority were clearly of opinion that the dark grapes were much better tasted, carried better and sold better. Resolutions were adopted in memory of Henry Mankedick, one of the earliest members of the society. The society reassembles at 9 o'clock this morning. California Excursions, Dec. 14, 21 and 28.

Patterson, fine livery. 80 East Court st Catarrh to Consumption. Catarrh, in its destructive force, stands next to and undoubtedly leads on to consumption. It is, there fore, singular that those afflicted with this fearful dis ease should not make it the object of their lives to rid themselves of it. Deceptive remedies, concocted by ignorant pretenders to medical knowledge, bave weak ened the confidence of the great majority of sufferers in all advertised remedies. They become resigned to a life of misery rather than torture themselves with doubtful palliatives. But this will never do. Catarrh must be met at every stage and combated with all our might. In many cases the disease has assumed dangerous symp toms. The bones and cartilage of the nose, the organs of hearing, o seeing and of tasting so affected as to be useless, the uvula so elongated, the throat so inflamed and irritated as to produce a constant and distressing cough. Sanford's Radical Cure meets every phase of Ca tarrh, from a simple head cold to the most loathsome and destructive stages. It is local and constitutional. Instant in relieving, permanent in' curing, safe, economical and never-failing.
