PRESIDENT'S AKHUAL MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Makes Recommendations for What He Considers Important Legislation. RAILROAD RATES FIRST TOPIC Would Materially Increase the Powers of Interstate Com merce Commission. LIFE INSURANCE QUESTION Sew Good and Evil in Labor Unions Asks lor Immediate Appropri ations for Panama Canal, and Promises Keport of Board of En gineers and Recommendations Later Other Matters. Washington, Dec. 6. The annual mes sage of president Roosevelt s read In both houses of congress to-day. It Is a doc ument of some 24.(X)0 words, and con tains recommendations for much important legislation. , The subject of federal supervision of cor porations, and especially railroad corpora tions, Is the first subject treated of by the president, and to It he gives the greatest amount of attention. After speaking of the general prosperity of the country, and the power of the corporations for good or evil In connection with the nation's prosperity, lie says: So long as the finances of the nation are kept upon an honest basis, no other question of internal economy with which the congress has the power to deal begins to approach In Importance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the Individuals and especially the great corporations doing an Interstate business are to act. The makers of our national constitution provided especially that the regulation of Interstate commerce should come with in the sphere of the general government. The arguments In favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to-day, In view of the enormous development of great business agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusive ly thai It Is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by state action. Guch regulation and supervision can only be effectively exercised by a sovereign Whose Jurisdiction Is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by the national government. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves impossible, It will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the national government by a proper amendment of the constitution. It would obviously be unwise to endeavor to secure such ail amendment until It ts certain that th reavilt ca.an.ot be obtained under the constitution as It now Is. The laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often In showing that the states have no power in the matter than that the national government ha power; so that there at present exists a very unfortunate condition of things, under which these great corporations do ing an Interstate business occupy the po sition of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the na tional government having effective con trol over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and care fully undertaken, but resolutely per severed In, to assert the sovereignty of the national government by affirmative action. Present Laws Inadequate. It has been a misfortune that the na tional laws on this subject have hitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative kir.d, and still more that they have in part sought to prohibit what could not be effectively prohibited, and have In part in their prohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be allowed. It Is gen erally us.less to try to prohibit all re straint on competition, whether this re straint be reasonable or unreasonable; end where it Is not useless It is gener ally hurtful. Events have shown that it Is not pn.-slhle adequately to secure the enforcnient of any law of this kind by Incessnrl appeal to the courts. The de part. vit of justice has for the last four J-far? (I, 'voted more attention to the en loreeineni of the anil-trust legislation than to anything ele. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked has been the mural effect of tlie prosecutions; but ii Increasingly ,.rldr;it ihat there will be a very insulllcient beneficial re sult In the -way or economic change. The Successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops an other device lo accomplish the same pur pose What Is needed Is not sweeping prohihiMnn nf every arrangement, good or bad, which may ten.) to restrict com petition, but . such adequate supervision and regulation as will prevent any re striction of ' competition from' being to the detriment of the, public as well as such supervision and regulation as will prevent other abuses ,ln no way connected with restriction pf competition. Of these abuses, perhaps' the chief, although by " no 'means the only one, Is, overcapitaliza tion generally Itself the result of dishon est promotion because o the myriad evils it brings In Its train; for such over capitalization often means an Inflation that Invites business panic; it always con ceals the true relation of the profit earned to the capital actually Invested, and It creates a burden of Interest payments which Is fertile cause of Improper re duction lit or limitation of wages; It damages the small Investor, discourages thrift, and encourages gambling and (Deculution; while perhaps worst of all Is the trlcklness and dishonesty which It implies for harm to morals is worse than any possible barm to material Interests, and the debauchery of politics and busi ness by great dishonest corporations Is far worse than any actual material evil they do the public. Until the national government obtains, In some manner which the wisdom of the congress may uggrst, proper control over the big cor porations engaged In Interstate commerce that Is, over the great majority of the big corporations It will be impossible to deal adequately with these evils.

The lirst thine; to do Is to d-nl with the great corpuralioiis i-ii....! h. tlve b"J:-::v. rs of lntt-rst.it f irspt. -t.itif.-i As I siol In my ni ss.itr.- of !. emit, r hist the llTitveiltate niil most pr.-ssinir no.-'!, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the ifovern inent sik h s-.ipi rvision ami n-tr llatiita of tne rates charted hy the railroads of the emintry engaged in Interstate trarhc as shall summarily and effec tively prcvttit the imposition of unjust or unreason;' h!- rates. It must include putting a complete stop to rebates in every shape ami form. This powt r to regelate rates like all similar powers oer toe business world, should be ix t r. istd vt.lh mot'era t ion. itii.ii and self-restraint; but it should t !.-1. so that it car. be effectively exercised when the need arises. The first consideration to be kept In mind is thit the power should be attirmath-tt ! should be given to some administrative body crcattd by the congress. If given to the present Interstate commerce commission or to a reorganized Interstate commerce commission, such commission should be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe In the government In terfering with prlvnte business more than Is necessary. I do not believe In the government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left in private hands. liut neither do I be lieve In the government flinching from overseeing liny work when it becomes evident that abuses are sure to ob tain therein unless there Is govern mental supervision. It Is not my prov ince to Indicate the exact terms of the law which should lie enacted; but I call the attention of the congress to certain existing conditions with which it is desirable to deal. In my Judg ment the most Important provision which such law should contain is that conferring upon sonic competent ad ministrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before It, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad Is reasonable and Just, and if it Is found to be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation of the complnlnt, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which It shall not be lawful to go the maximum reason able rnte. as it Is commonly called this decision to go Into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate Is too high but that a favored shipper Is given too low a rate. In such case the commis sion would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum; and it would need only one or two such decisions by the com mission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving Improper mini mum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my proposal Is not to give the commission power to Initiate or originate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or origi nated by the ruds, upon complaint and after Investigation. A heavy penalty ahould be exacted from any corporation which falls to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate, as being essential to any scheme of real reform In the matter of railway regulation. The first necessity Is to secure It; and unless It Is granted to the commission there Is little use In touching the subject at all. Rebates Really Blackmail. Illegal transactions often occur un der the forms of law. It has often oc curred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after It has been bought an open re duction Is made In tne rate to take effect immediately, the arrangement resulting to the profit of the one ship per and the one railroad and to the damage of all their competitors; for It must not be forgotten that the blK shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad In the matter of rebates. The law should make It clear so that nobody can fall to under stand that any kind of commission paid on freight shipments, whether in this form or In the form of fictitious damages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or pay ment of brokerage, is Illegal. It is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are de moralizing and are used as rebates. The best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be that regulation secured by an honest agreement among the railroads themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for Instance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or big railroad to dis criminate against or secure advan tages over some rival; and such agree ment would make the railroads them selves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested in the government to put a stop to agreements to the detriment nf the public should. In my iudemcnt. be accompanied by power to permit, under specified conditions and ! careful supervision, nereemenis clear ly In the interest of the public. But. In my Judgment, the necessity for giving this further power is by no means as grent as the necessity for giving the commission or administra tive body the other powers I have enumerated above; and it may w.-ll lie Inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power In the commission or other administrative body until it al ready possesses end is exercising what I regard as by rar tne most important of all the powers I recommend as In deed the vitally Important power that to fix a given maximum rate, which rate, after the lapse of a reason able time, goes into full effect, subject to review by the courts. All private car lines, Industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate commerce commission or some similar body so far as rates and agreements practically affecting rates are concerned. The prlvnte car owners and the owners of Industrial railroads are en titled to a fair and reasonable compensa tion on their Investment, but neither pri vate cars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing preferential rates. A rebate In Icing charges, or In mileage, or In a divi sion of the rate for refrigerating charges Is Just as pernicious as a rebate In any other way. No lower rate should apply on goods Imported than actually obtains on domestic goods from the American seaboard to destination except in cases where water competition Is the controll ing Influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged in Interstate business should keep any books or mem oranda other than those reported pur suant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the Inspection of the government. Only In this way can violations or evasions of tho law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted Into the national banks by the bank ex aminers; a few first-class railroad ac countants, if they had proper direction and proper authority to Inspect books and papers, could accomplish much In pre- :it.f.i; v.:i::ul v.

I urne up 'ti the congress the need of urovi.l ng lor expc iltito.S aetion by the met -late . omuieive commission in all liese loaner.-, whet hi r in regulating lates fur transpoi tat nn or for storing or for handling property or commodities n trans. t. Tin1 history of the cases liti gated under the present commerce act -iiows that Its cilicacy hus been to a great legrie destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the mojf formidable weapon in the hands of lhu,ie whose purpose it is to violate the law. The presU.'eiit asks for legislation com pelling railroads to install block systems on tlu ir lines, and also calls the attention of congress lo the excessive hours of labor of train service employes of the railroad companies are i":en subjected to. He rec ommends that a commission be appointed to study of employers' liability with the ob ject of the enactment of a law covering the subject and applicable to all Industries wltiiin the scope of the federal power. The Labor Question. The labor question is treated of at con siderable ieiigil., and in this coruectlon the president says: There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue injunctions In labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of oor courts would be most uns i.,c. It Is true that some Judges have misused tills power; but this does not Justify a denial of the power any more than an Improper exer cise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would Justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy Is to regulate the procedure by requiring the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hear ing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What Is due notice must depend uvon the facts of the case; It should not be used as a pretext to permit violation of law, or the Jeopardizing of life or property. Of course this would not au thorize the Issuing of a restraining order or Injunction in any case In which It Is not already authorized by existing law. 1 renew the recommendation I made !n my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child lalor legislation In the several states. Such an Investigation should take Into account the various problems with which the question of child labor Is connected. It Is true that these problems can be actu ally met In most cases only by the states themselves, but It would be well for the nation to endeavor to secure and publish comprehensive Information as to the con ditions of the labor of children In the dif ferent states, so as to spur up those that are behindhand, and to secure approx imately uniform legislation of a high character among the several states. In such a republic ns ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect Is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the nation depends upon the citizenship of the generations to come; the children of to-day are those who to-morrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neg lect them. The legislature of Colorado has recommended that the national gov ernment provide some general measure for the protection from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable con sideration. The department of commerce and labor should also make a : thorough Investiga tion of the conditions of women In In dustry. Over 5.000,000 American women are now engaged in gainful occupations; yet there Is an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trust worthy conclusions as regards, a subject as Important as It Is vast and compli cated. There is need of full knowledge on which to base action looking toward state and municipal legislation for the protection of working women. The In troduction of women Into Industry Is working change and disturbance In the domestic and social life of the nation. The decrease In marriage, and especially In the birth rate, hns been coincident with It. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must be made; but surely it can be made with less friction and less harmful effects on family life than is now the case. This whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time; It Is a social question of the first Importance, of far greater Im portance than any merely political or economic question can be; and to solve It we need ample data, gathered In a sane and scientific spirit in the course of an exhaustive Investigation. In concluding with the subject of labor the president suys: In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employe interested, but also a third party the general public, Kvery considerable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is Involved should be investigated by the govern ment and the facts officially reported to the public. Equal Bights for All. The question of securing a healthy, self-respecting and mutually sympathetic attitude as between employer and em ploye, capitalist and weife-- vmrkrr, ls-a difficult form reicu'ation of the vast Insurance Interests of this country. The failed States should in thin rt .--peet follow the policy of olner nations by providing adequate national supervision of com-ne-ria! inter-. wh'eh Hre elenrlv na tional In character. My pretieeessors have repeatedly recognizid that the "foreign busjTitss of these compunltj is an imp.,1 taut p.-.rt of our foreign com mercial relation.-. During the admin istrations of 1'residents Cleveland. Ilirris.ui and XleKinle.v the state de part mint txercised its influence, through diplomatic channels, to pre vent unjust ilisorin'iiintlon by foreign countries against American Insurance cpuiies. These negotiations illus trated the pnTpriity of the congress ier.igni7.init tlie national character of Insurance v f.,r in the absence of fed eral leiri.Nt,,'.; xui the slate department could oiiie, five expression to the wishes ot Hie authorities of the several states, whose policy was Ineffective through want of un.formity. I repeat my previous recommenda tion that the congress should also con sider whether the federal government has any power or owes any duty with respect to domestic transactions in In surance of an Interstate character. That state supervision has proved In adequate Is generally conceded. The burden upon Insurance companies, and therefore' their policy holders, of con flicting regulations of many states. Is unquestioned, while but little effective check is "imposed upon any able and unscrupulous man who desires to ex ploit the company In his own Interest at the expense of the policy holders and of the public. The Inability of a state to regulate effectively Insurance corporations created under the laws of other states and transacting the larger part of their business elsewhere 1b also clear. As a remedy for this evil of conllicting. Ineffective, and yet bur densome regulations . there has been for many liars a widespread demand for federal supervision. The congress has already recognized that Interstate insurance may be a proper subject for federal legislation, for in creating the bureau of corporations it authorized it to publish nnd supply useful In formation concerning Interstate cor porations, "Including corporations en gaged In Insurance." It Is obvious that If the compilation of statistics be the limit of the federal power. It Is wholly Ineffective to regulate this form of commercial Intercourse be tween the states, and as the Insurance business has outgrown In magnitude the possibility of adequate state su pervision, the congress should care fully consider whether further legisla tion can be had. What Is said above applies with equal force to fraternal and benevolent organizations which contract for life Insurance. Under the subject of national revenues the president makes a plea for the enact ment of reciprocal arrangements between this and other countries, but does not ask for any tariff legislation at the present time. In the same connection he asks for economy In appropriations. Business Methods in Departments. On the subject of "graft" In the several government departments that have been under Investigation he says: At various times I have Instituted investigations Into the organization and conduct of the business of the ex ecutive departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclu sions, they have already confirmed and emphasized the general Impres sion that the organization of the de partments Is often faulty In principle and wasteful In results, while many of their business methods are anti quated and Inefficient. There is every reason why our executive govern mental machinery should be st least as well planned, economical and efficient as the best machinery of the great business organizations, which at present Is not the case. To make It so Is a task of complex detail and es sentially executive In Its nature; prob ably no legislative body, no matter how wise and able, could undertake It with reasonable prospect of success. I recommend that the congress con sider this subject with a view to pro vide by legislation for the transfer, distribution, consolidation and assign ment of duties and executive organisa tions or parts of organisations, and for the changes In business methods, within or between the several depart ments, that will best promote the economy, efficiency and high character of the government work. Federal Elections. On the subject of federal elections he rec ommends that It be made unlawful for po litical parties to receive campaign con tributions from the corporations, and also that It be made unlawful for corporations to give such contributions, and In this con nection he says: Contributions by corporations to any purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such pur poses; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as It went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the na tional and the several state legisla tures forbid any officer of a corpora tion from using the money of the cor poration in or about any election, but tliev should also forbid such usp of money In connection with any legisla tion save by the employment of coun sel In public manner for distinctly le gal services. The Hague Conference. The Hague conference nnd the sub ject of arbitration generally is treated of at considerable length, and In this connection an explanation Is given of tills government's connection with the coming conference in the following words: The first conference of nations held nt The Hague in 1W. being unable to dls pose of nil the business before it. recom- rionw1 the rnnslderatlon and settlement one.

The Insurance Scandal. On the subject of life Insurance the presi dent says recent events have emphasized the Importance of early action looking to a solution of the subject of some sort of con trol that will furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed, and In this connection he continues: Ther la need of a stricter and unl- ' - J condition that we should wait Until the end of the war then waging between Rus sia and Japan.
