The President's Message. —o— B_ln the discussion of the reference of the President's message to appropriate Com 'mitteea in the House of Representatives Mr. Richardson of Illinois, took occasion to re view that document, in which he says, '-it is remarkable for what it says, and still more remarkable for what 'it omits. The one half of the twenty-one pages was devoted to the nd&ro There was no page, sentence or line as to the bravery of cundfcct cf those in the field endeavoring to maintain the Union, and No sorrow was expressed for the lamented dead, the maimed and wounded; no sympathy was expressed for the widow or the orphan made by the progress of this war, which could have been avoided by honorable compromise, if the President and his friends had desired peace. The President proposed ; to tax the white man forever for the benefit of ! flic negro. This was the substance of (he message. Tears of blood arc to he shed and j countless millions of dollars spent for the j black man, and when the public ask the Pros- j ident to know what hrfee there wftseff the res toration o'f thb Umofi, by 'inference they are \ told, if yon carry out my *6l tins and schemes j yofi ibay hope to have the Union restored.— Every argument for a change of the constitu tion is for the negro. No benefit for the white man. But the people in duo time Will com promise for the benefit of white men, not for negroes." In the course of his remarks con demnatory of the administration,he spoke in opposition to the bill passed to day indemni fying the President and others from tho con sequences of suspending the habeas corpus, j saying the courts will not sanction tho reck- ' less and tyrannical exorcise, of power, The! party in power, he argued, had violated the' constitution and the laws. The committee rose and at hclf past four o'clock the House adjourned, Washing a Crow win ...a hlm White. i®" The A'<w which his been proposed in, aud will no doubt be thssed by Congress, in demnifying the President hnd his tools against prosecution by an outraged people for the wrongs inflicted upon their persons and prop rty, in illegal searches, arrests, confinement, &c., is the last struggle of a condemned and 'dying party. Entrenching itself within a "magic circle of terror," —closing up, by an arbitrary majority in Congress, all sources of investigation—with the Press hand-bound and tongue-tied, this Administration has ridden rough-shod over the people, regardless of legal; moral or social rfghts, and now when the day of reckoning looms up in the misty distance, they seek to shield themselves from the people's indigna tion by an act of Indemnification. In this country, where men arc born of in dependent mind, and draw their ideas of free dom with their lacteal fluid from the fount maternal; such Invasion of right—sttrh libuso of powor and trust as lias been practiced by this Administration, however disguised an rendored plausible by pretence, will not for any great length of time he submitted to, and must be aceofiiitcd for at soriie time or other and in some way. An act of indemnity may serve to shield them for the present, but the sensation produced throughout the country has been too violent to be thus easily quieted. '

"COMMON CONSENT IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE BASIS"dE GOVERNMENT." Green-Backs that are not a Legal Ten der. TBgAlthough Congress has declared the Greenbacks issued under their authority to be a legal tender, there is an opposition variety in circulation, issued by some ambitious char acter which need not be so belong ing, as they do, to the bogus order TlnSy arc of the denomination o'f five dollars, photo graphic, and according to the Chambersburg Valley Spirit, arc well calculated to deceive, and would not be detected at a pasual glance by one man out of five hundred. Compared closely with the genuine bills, they are found to be about a sixteenth of an inch longer, and the paper harsher and stiffyr. The signatures show more plainly on the back of the bills than in good money, and tho shading of the engraving is heavier and darker. Other de fects would probably be disclosed on a very critical examination. It is likely these coun terfeits have obtained a wide circulation here and elsewhere ; and it will become necessary for the pcoplo to bo a little more careful in handling "greenbacks" than they have hereto fore been. It also appears that, there arc counterfeit fifty cent notes of tire new postage currency in circulation. They arc said to be well exe cuted, and should be guarded against. Tho following easily-noted marks will enable hol ders to detect them 'i 1". Thy paper is thinner than the genuine. 3. The five faces of Washington vary consid erably from each other in the counterfeit—so much so that two or three if them, if standing alone, would hardly be taken to ba portraits of Washington—while on the genu;no they all closely resemble each other. 3. The link ed letters "U. S." under the middle faco of Washington, in the counterfeit do not show the lower end of the "S," inside the lt'g of tho "U," while in the genuine they do. This mark is easily seen. 4. The border round the lettering and "50" on the back of the counter feit is dark, and the lines are crowded, while in the genuine the border is open, with a line of light dots running through the middle all tho way round. In the counterfeit this mid dle lino is almost invisible, while in the genu ine it is so distinct as to catch the eye at once Something "Wrong—A Caution. tlijyjjist fen- weeks two letters . on business', mailefllo us at fiaucocK, nave j failed ip come to hind".

HAGERSTOWN, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 19, JB2. From the Albany Argus. ARRESTS BY THE WAR DEPART ME NT, LETTER OF JUDGE GOULD. We charged long since, that the arrest of persons in the city of New York, accusod of frauds upon the Quartermaster's Depnrtmeij was made for the purposo of concealment, is order to shield the guilty parties, and to do stoy the evidence of a mammoth fraud. One of tlio parties arrested, C. Golden Tra cy, is a relative of Judge Gould, of this Dis trict, who, believing him innocent, appeals! to the President to know the ground of his ai* rest, and to demand.* trial. ,1 The President has been deaf to.this appeal; and this has elicited the correspondence which we publish. The language of the Judge is high toned and resolute: NEW 

YORK, NO>\ 14, 1802. To His Excellency, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United S'ates;— Sir—On my arrival in this city, from my residence in Troy, N. Y., I find that a cousiu ol'mine, G. Golden Tracy, a broker of this city, has been, first, arrested and sent to Fort La fayette, and secondly, to-day takeu as a pris oner to Washington. The newspapers say— and so far as I can learn by all inquiries of authorities I can hear nothing different—that the cause of the arrest is some dealings he has had in contractor's drafts on government offi cers for moneys; and, it js said, some frauds were co'mniitfedm or by the drafts, and he is charged with complicity therewith. If this bo so, it is a crime cognizable by the courts, and only by the courts. And lam amazed at tho fatuity of public officers who can take lis warning from the distinct uttered voice of a free people. I am, and always have Seen, an unwavering enemy of this rebellion—(cursed in its origin, most accursed its progress)—and a supporter of the administration. lam a judge of the highest court of this State. And if no honest voice has yet reached tho ears of our govern ment, I wish to say, and to be heard in say ing, that Star Chamber process and Secreta ry's warrants are dangerous instruments to play with, and that, among us, the true staunch supporters of the government, who would crush treason with the iron heel, but who know the law, arc compelled to hang hruuls in silcncp at mention of cases which have occurred m bur midst. Spies arc hardly cautioned when tlicy arc where they can do infinite harm; but a pow erful hind and an oppressive one, is laid on a person here, who is not iii a p'osition for doing mischief, if he would, and who is supposed to have no friends. In this respect, I thank God, there has been a mistake. It is true that he is a young man, of not much means or influence; it is also true that he lias a young wife (married not long since;) and for no assigned cause, anil for no assignable cause, that those in power dare to give breath to, he is taken away from home, without giving to his wife an instuut's inter view or a chance to see him. Is this country the France of a century ago?. The young map is the grandson of that Uriah Tracy, who lived and died a Senator of the U. States from Connecticut, who was the first man buried in the Congressional burying ground at AVashiugton, and whose ashes arc insulted by this atrocious invasion of the lib erties of the people in the person of his des cendant. f afn trot only speaking my own opinion of such arrests. I know the opinion and tho feelings of many of my brethren of the bench. And if the government is really desirous of so proceedings as to make it our duty to make public our opinions, they will bo heard, not merely in the writ of habeas corpus, but in open declaration to the world. e . Hud I been a few hours earlier made aware of this case, I should not havo troubled you with a word; but I would have seen that the process of tlio Supreme Court of tho State was so executed as to protect its citizens accused of such offences from any arrest, other than oho under the appropriate profess of courts' I beg again to assure you in all sincerity, that t! is kind of proceeding has gone too far already, and that, while to the last of our men and our means we are ready and' determined to sustain the luw, and the government in en forcing the law over tho whole land ah one country, we arc also determined to be judged by the law, and not by any Secretary or any one who is hot commissioned for that purpose. AVc know and acknowledge tho rules of war, where tho necessity of the caso requires the existence of martial law. But we know, also, the common law of liberty, and the broad, great charter of the Constitution. I write warmly, zealously, because I cannot bear to think of our cherished government's taking any course to injure itself; at a time, too, when our only hope of escaping tho eter nal disgrace ar.d humiliation of letting the cause of htitnan- liberty perish in our hands is to sustain the government of this Union, and to hh've'it a government worth sustaining. AVith great respect, yours, drc., 

GEORGE GOULD. Af AVAST OF BLANKETS.—According to the Abbcrvillo (Miss.) correspondent of the Grenada Appeal, Ae Confederate soldiers now pray mightily for a battle, and add a petition that tlioir foe may bare plenty of blankets. THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC. BdMBAR§MENt OF OER CKSBUR6. PREPARATIONS FOB THE ATTACK. A letter in the New York Tribune from the scene of action, dated Wednesday night, (a few hours before the engagement,) notes the following preparations for tho attack : A bright, clear day has been followed by a glorious night. Since sunset the rumbling of artillery is being heard from all directions.— The long ponderous pontoon trains arc slowly rolling over the roads to the river. Long col umns of troops are everywhere In motion. — At three o'clock the engineers w dl begin their work, and with daylight five bridges will be laid. Every hill commanding, tho opposite side is crowned with artillery, at)d every shel tering ravine near the river crammed full with infantry. As soon as the fog wiil have sufficiently cleared away in the morning to give aim to our artillery, the troops , will commence mo ving over tho bridges, with Gen. Sumner's command in the advanco. Those hundred guns will be in position to sweep away every obstruction with a hurricane of shot and shell such as never bofort resoundod on this conti nent. About dark a number of signal rockets were observed ascending on the other side, and gave riso to the apprehension that the enemy were apprised of the" impending movements; but as a fog settled upon the river and valley early in the morning, and the banks aro strongly picketed for Jnilos, it is, hardly possible that such information has already reached them. From the uppermost pq'nt selected for Crea sing it is only two miles to the lowest, and hence the sanguinary spectacle wili be enacted With concentrated intensity. The army wag never in better condition and moro eager for battle. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ATTACK.. The poontoon t rains arc being laid under a tremendous fire of artillery and musketry.— the first shots were fired from the rebel right, a short distance below Fredericksburg. The boats for the bridges at Falmouth and in front of the Lacy Ilouse, wore nearly all floated into their proper positions before the enemy open ed his (ire. The first volley was fired upon the Lacy Ilouse bridge, and was very severe, creating much confusion among the horses, .out roi a moment delaying the Work upon the bridge. The rebels are under the protection of the liou,ses in Fredericksburg, aud are firing from 'the windows aud roofe of nearly all located near tbo joints of crossing. DETAILS OF THE JjATTLIh HEADQUARTERS. Opposite Fredericksburg, Dec. 11—3 P. Jf. Between four und five o'clock this morning the pontoon train, in charge of the Seven teenth and Fiftieth New Vork Engineers, and under command ofGon. Woodbury, proceeded to the river bank, where, with infantry sup ports, an attempt was made to throw three bridges across tho river—one at the point, where the railroad bridge formerly crossed, and two more opposite the city, but nearer Falmouth. A dull haze so obscnrcd v thc movement that for a time it was not discovered by the rebel pickets. The pontooners had succeeded in partially constructing the liridgo when the rebels suddenly opened a very brisk and deadly fire of musketry from along tho banks of the river and the windows of the houses, compelling the cessation of the work. Some of onr men were shot midway in the streafo, aud falling overboard from tho boats, floated down the river. . . . lieturning to tlio cover of tho surrounding hills, the men were again formed, and about six o'clock tlio attempt to bridge the river was renewed; but the rebels had now been thor oughly aroused to a sense of what was going forward, and with reinforcements of sharp shooters swarmed tho opposito banks and hou ses. Nothing daunted by tbo hot tiro which they potirod in at the reappearance of our troops, the pontooners wcut gallantly to work. But in vain. A storm of bullets enveloped tbem. Tho air was alive with the leaden mes sengers of death. The planks and boats were riddled by every volley. Once more tlioy were compelled to with draw, and they fell back to tho cover of th 0 ridge of hills running parallel with tho river. As it was evident that the rebels were deter mined to use the houses of tho city for n de fense, contrary to an implied agreemept in tho correspondence which recently passed by flag of truce, orders were given to our artillery men to open fire upon the city. Accordingly Benjamin's Edwards', Muhicnburg's and oth cr batteries of the Ninth corps, together with tho batteries of tho corps to tho right and left of the city, commenced an almost simultane ous bombardment The fog was so dense that it was impossible to see but a short distance beyond tho edge of the river. The houses,, however, in which the rebel sharps hootors had ensconsed themselves, were plainly visible, and to them the fire was for a time particular ly directed. The effect was thoir partial de molition in a short timo. After the jirst lire they became untenable by the rebel riflemen, who retreated to the rear of tho town, where tlioy took shelter behind the as yet unharmed buildings. By soven o'clock tho bombardment bad bc como general, and from that lime until one, o'clock the roar #f artillery was incessant, while the shot and shell tell fast und thick in to the doomed city. From tlio vicinify of the Lacy House, a brick building overlooking the centre of tho city, the batteries of tho Nith corps, raked the streets with shelf, sehrapancl and grape.— Though the fog still continued to obscuro in a measure the results of these discharges, yet the walls could be heard crumbling and tbe timbers crashing. The rebels, with the great est stnbborness, still kept within the city, and at times parties of them could be seen go ing from one point to another on the doable quick. The carnage cannot but bo fearful amongst them. It is somewhat singular that tho rebel bat teries did net return the fire of our guns, tip to the present time they have not oponod in res ponse. About ten o'clock the engineers were formed for a third attempt to construct the bridge.— The Eighth Connectisut, under Major Word, was lying at this time near the river bank; in support of one of our batteries, After the pre vious ineffectual attempts on the part of tho engineers to cross, a pnrty of eighty inen from if.o regiment, under Captain March, volun teered to assist in this new endeavor to finish laying the bridge, and once more tho column, with this reinforcement; started down to the river. • - • Under the direction of General Woodbury, they seized tho planks and carried out terns dozen to tho en! of the etrir.g of boats, placed a part cf them, and wore then compelled to retire, very galling fire from tho reb el sharpshooters, who were ensconced secure ly in riflo pits, bolow tho range of the artille ry, and within fifteen or twenty feet of the river edge. Two of tho Eighth Connecticut were wounded in this attempt, and the engi neers suffered severely. The movement having thus been interrupt ed, the whole party were ordered back to their original position. At eleven o'clock it was discovered that one of tbe houses was 011 fire. Tko flames, which commenced in the westerly part of tho city, toon spread, and Fredericksbarg is now en veloped in fire and smoke.. .~. .. .... ... An enfilading fire has been opened upon the rebel rifle pits from our batteries up the river. Xt has been successful, so faT, in driving the sharpshooters from the vicinity of the railroad depot. :
