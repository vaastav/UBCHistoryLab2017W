FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1999. TWELVE PAGES. They Will Go for Chandler, Now. ENATOR CHANDLER of New Hampshire will doubtless be the next to receive criticisms at the hands of those newspapers which are finding fault with every movement which has for its object the investiga tion of the charges of bribery conne.t ed with the election of Mr. Clark. Mr. Chandler introduced a resolution in structing the senate committee on priv ileges and elections to investigate the right of W. A. Clark of Montana to re tain his seat. Like Fred Whiteside, Congressman Campbell, Attorney Gen eral Nolan, Charles S. Hartman and Governor Smith, Senator Chandler must now expect to receive a torrent of abuse from those who are consist ently opposing each and every action which seems to be aimed at an investi gation of the manner of Mr. Clark's election. It makes no difference what course may be pursued in this matter-those who seem to be afraid that the secrets of the Clark election may be exposed, find fault with that particular course. It makes no difference what men of high standing may express the view that Mr. Clark is not worthy of the seat he is occupying, or may endeavor to forward an investigation into h:I elec tion, their actions are sure to be criti cised by those newspapers which are in favor oa Mr. Clark retaining his seat, no matter what crimes may have been committed to place him there. What ever course may be pursued to bring about the investigation of Clark's elec tion, the objection Is made that that course is not the right one. Whatever man may take a prominent position in this matter, the objection is always made that it was "bad taste" or "m proper" for that particular man to have take part in the proceedings; that some one else should have takecn the promin ent part. It is very apparent that no course which could have been decided on to bring about the investigation would have been satisfactory to those who want no investigation. It is apparent that no prosecutor or complainant would have been satisfactory to those who want no prosecutors and no com plainants. Like Whiteside, Campbell, Nolan, Gvernor Smith and the rest, Senator Chandler will probably be able to stand it. Unfairness in Debate. p NY cause that Is a good one, can be upheld by fair, unevasive argumentation, and without misrepresenting either the essential facts or the position of the opposing side. When shifty tactics are resorted to it Invariably creates the suspicion that the cause is intrinsically weak. This Is In accord with all human a.x perience and in every forum of dot'bit. When a shyster lawyer is :n court with a had case, he always endavc,rs to keep as far fromu thot main issue a:; possible, directing the attention ,f court or jury to matters of sc-cndary consequence and frequently of no col sequence at all. Favorite weapons i1 such cases are abuse, ridicule and mis statement so far as the latter is possi ble In a court of law. Such practice is usually brought up with an a round turn when attempted in a court of character and ability. But of course In debating public ques tions before the people no arbitrary restrictions can be imposed. As a rule, those who essay the discuss!on of such questions can only be held in check by their own sense of propriety, and there is no safeguard against false and misleading statements except as it may exist in the discriminating intelligence of the people. It is doubtful if any period of our country's political history furnishes clearer and more convincing evidence of the truth of these reflections than is found in the attitude of parties, In dividuals and newspapers during the last year. This evidence has manifest ed itself in a striking degree in the treatment of the Philippine question by Mr. McKinley and his supporters. As to the president's policy in those islands we have yet to see the first absolutely fair statement either of the merits of the policy itself or the atti tude of its opponents. In this sweep ing declaration we make no saceptions, but include everything which has been said upon that side whether uttered by the president himself, one of his cabi net officers, or the most insignificant follower. In his recent message the president not only makes statements of facts that are open to the gravest question, but he completely ignores the very essence of the controversy. So far as our right to the Philippines is con cerned he relies solely upon the treaty with Spain, by which that country transferred to us whatever title she had. Th!s he asserts to be perfectly good, and to give us a title that can not be assailed either in law or equity. In view of the fact that at the time of the signing of the treaty the insur gent natives had wrested nearly or quite nine-nine one-hundredths of the territory from Spain, and were then in possession of it, even this technical argument is far from being conclusive, especially the "equity" part of it. But the opposition stands upon a far higher plane. It asserts the broad principle that the ten millions of na tives have just the same natural and unalienable rights in their own coun try that we have in ours, and that their plea for self-government is one that no American can justly deny. Mr. McKinley absolutel: ignores this great princilple, and this attitude of the oppo sition. His statement that the vast major ity are loyal and desirous of submitting to American rule has no foundation of proof to rest upon. Every person hav ing the slightest familiarity with con ditions in the islands knows that not only has there been no attempt made to get a fair expression of sentiment, but that the American authorities have never yet come into actual touch with one-fifth of the population. It is there fore simply impossible for him to know what their wishes are, and every rea Eonable presumption is against his con clhsion. It is persistently assumed that the -,rrosition has demanded and still de mands that the military and naval forces of the United States shall be at once withdrawn from the Islands. No such demand has been made any more than in the case of Cuba. The con tention is that the Filipinos should have the assurance of self-government at the earliest practicable day and the assistance of the United States in main taining it. Nor has the opposition objected to the acquisition ef naval and coaling stations, or any commercial conces sions possible to secure by the free ands voluntary act of the people of the sal ands. In this way we could have ac quired every desirable commercial and naval advantage without any sacrifice of blood or treasure, and without !n curring the odium of trampling upon the liberties of the people of.those dis tant Isles. These are the issues as presented these are the issues that neither Mr. McKinley nor any of his apologists have even attempted to squar:ly meet. On the contrary, we have had eva slons, quibbles and misstatements, coupled with the epithets "copperhead" and "traitor"-epithets which an edu cated parrot could employ quite as well and with just about equal intelligence. Hence the unavoidable conclusion that the president's policy is a bad one, and indefensible by fair and candid debate. Bloodiest of All Battles. C EýERAL 

METHUEN'P little dis • patch to the effect that his bat tie with the Boers at Modder river was "the bloodiest battle of the century" has aroused a controversy in the press of this country and of Europe. In proof of Methuen's claim, the Den ver Republican publishes a table show Ing the percentage of losses in some of the great battles of the century. At Jena 110,000 men were engaged and the percentage of loss was 20. At Water loo the number of men engaged was 139,608, and the percentage of loss was 21. At Bull Run the number of men engaged was 60,527, and the percentage of loss was eight. At Gettysburg the number of men engaged was 150,000 and the loss was 40 per cent. At Sadowa the number engaged was 291,000 and the loss 11 per cent. At Gravelotte there were 396,000 men in the battle and the loss was 15 per cent. At Sedan the number was 314,000 and the loss 15 per cent. The Republican figures that the per centage of losses in the Modder river affair was greater than in any of the big battles it names. The Modder river affair, however, could scarcely be char aecterized as anything more than a skir mishl. General Methuen's losses, ac cording to his official report, were 452, while in the three days' fighting in ithat vicinity the total reached 965 men. That is a frightful percentage of loss, n.'n.sidlcrin;g the cmeparatively small number cf men engaged, but in the civii "war, in the Napoleonic wars and in th IFrancu-Plrussian war engage ments brilctc tn such small bodies of men would nt be considered battles and would hardly be dignlled by an official rep.r:t to the authlrities. If the nullitlbr vf Inll lost in prollor tion to tihe numr,,lr ulgaged, irrespl)c tive of how large r small the contend ing forces may have bcell, is to be con sidered in determlnining what is "the bloodiest battle of the century." then surely Custer's battle with the Sioux and Crow Indians in M.ontana is de serving of that designation. At Modder river, as in all the other battles men tioned, only a portion of the total num ber reported as "lost" were actually killed. Many were only wounded and many were captured. All these are designated in the oflicial report as "lost." But in Custer's battle there were no wounded and no captured. On that fateful day in June, 1876, Custer's entire force,261 strong, was annihilated. Not one was left to tell the story. The percentage of loss on the side of the United States army was 100. That was a bloodier battle than the one in which General Methuen was engaged. A Step Forward. T.HFERE is hope that Butte's School of Mines will be equipped and opened before another year has passed. Steps to effect this most desir able result were taken at the recent meeting of the state board of educa tion in Helena, and the members of the board seem determined that there shall be no further delay. At the meet ing of the board the trustees who had had charge of the construction of the school tendered their resignations, their part of the work having been completed. A new board of trustees was appointed, the members of which are eminently qualified to take up the work intelligently and energetically and start the school under such favor able auspices that it will surely be come the success which Montana's school of mines should be. The new trustees are J. E. Rickards, James W. Forbis, George E. Moulthrop, W. Y. Pemberton and J. V. Long. At the last session of the legislature the sum of $25,000 was appropriated for the equipment of the school. If this amount can be madeimmediately avail able it should be sufficient to equip the school partially, and perhaps to such an extent that it can be opened in the fall. The trustees will have entire charge of the equipping of the school and the selection of the faculty. The branches taught will be chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, geology, min ing, mining engineering, mathematics, mechanics and drawLng. The state board insists that the school must be opened by September next. There will be general satisfaction that a good start at any rate has been made towards the opening of the school. To the traveler approaching Butte the splendid new building of the School of Mines is the most consplcu ous object. It is invariably the subject of inquiry on the part of all visitors to Butte. Its possibilities are boundless. No more time should be lost in getting the school opened, and the people of Montana are confident that the trus te . are possessed of the push, enter prise and ability which are required to speed the day when Montana's School of Mines shall be a reality. ENRY CLEWS, the Wall street banker, wants an act passed by congress which will determine forever the gold standard beyond any ',quivocatijn. Certainly he doer. So do nearly all the leading financiers of the country. So does Secretary Gage and so does William McKinley. But how do they expect to get such a meas ure? Are they ignorant enough to sup pose that one congress can enact a law which another congress cannot repeal if it has a president in accord with It? The enactment of such a law will give the gold power an unquestioned advan tage, because to repeal it will require the joint action of both houses of con gress and the approval of the presi dent. But it can be done. i---- - The Question of Quantity. Sf has been observed, repeatedly, that every essential argument of the bi metallists, is admitted by the cham pions of the gold standard except when the silver question is under immediate consideration. This is notably the case with refer ence to the quantitative principle. Illu strations innumerable have been given showing the truth of this statement. - We find it constantly exemplified in the operations of the treasury, in the I changing conditions of finances in Wall street, in the conduct of 'the Bank of England and in fact in the daily busi ness affairs of every individual. If, as has been so often claimed, the extension of credit has had the effect t of making the quantity of money im a material, why is not a single gold dol lar in the United Staes treasury as 3 good as two hundred millions, and why have the people been burdened with I two hundred and sixty-two millions of dollars ad iitlonal interest-bearing debt in order to keep the gold reserve above * the one hundred million dollar mark? 'Why does Wall street get frightened over gold exports? Why is there ever any talk of "scarce money" in that center? Why does the Bank of Eng land put up the rate of discount in order to protect its gold reserve? Why, in short, does any business man ever - fall, if the quantative theory is an i "antiquated" "pre-historic," "fossil " ized" and "utterly senseless" Idea? Why don't banks and business men bridge over the:r difficulties by merely extending their credit a little farther? The answer is plain. They cannot. They have already gone the limit in the matter of credit, and have reached a point at which actual money must be forthcoming or the credit will col lapse. Among the great gold dailies of the East is the Boston Herald. Only re cently that paper published an edi torial ridiculing the quantitative the ory, and declaring that "quality," not "quantity," was the great desideratum. And yet no longer ago than the second of the present month, in speaking of the action of the Bank of England in raising the rate of discount to six per cent, the Herald said: "The Bank of England is taking precautions to meet any drain of gold that may come through the war in South Africa. This war is a knife that cuts both ways. It cuts off the supply of gold from the Transvaal mines, and it calls for large shipments of sovereigns to meet the heavy war expenditure. With this out 10ok the bank Is quite right to put ireit in a strong position." Here we have as complete a recog nition of the quantitatlve principle as it is possible to put into language. The man who denies the theory of quan tity in money, must stand ready to defend the position that a business man or a bank can do as much business with one thousand dollars by simply increasing the use of credit, as he or it could with a hundred thonsand. We may discuss this point for the present with a very simple query: If the quan tity of money has nothing to do with prices and business, why did the recent shortage of money cause a break In stocks, and why did Mr. Gage deem it necessary to throw eighteen million dollars of additional gold into circu lation? ~ 

RESIDENT M'IKINLEY and Ad miral Dewey have done a highly commendable action in jointly undertaking ts pay the expenses of a preparatory course of study for the son of Captain Gridley, late commander of the Olympia. The course of study is designed to fit young Gridley for ad mission to a lieutenancy in the marine corps. Young Gridley is now too old to enter Annapolis, and the marine corps is the only place in the naval ser vice open to him. Admiral Dewey pro posed to get him appointed to the ma rine corps and planned to pay the necessary expenses. When he began to explain his plan to the president, however, Mr. McKinley insisted on being "in on nthe deal." Captain Grid ley's participation in the battle of Manila is well known to the American people. That his son will prove worthy of his parentage and be a brave de fender of the flag, no one may doubt.
