C, HANSF.MKR. | JOHN S. DICKINSON. ytatotj ani oSmnrnmial febitto. BALTIMORE, Dec. 1, 1860. There was some movement to day in Railroad shares, but in other Stocks there was comparatively little done. The general tone of the market was unite depressed, and everything on the list, with the single exception of Northern Central Railway, was lower. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad fell off $1 per share. There was however considerable done in it at the decline, sales of 850 shares being made at SSB cash. 11 closed at SSB bid, $59 asked regular way. Of Northern Central Railway there were 500 shares sold to day at sl6#@l6# cash, and it closed steady at sl6# bid, sl6# asked regular way. It closed yesterday at sl6 bid, sl6# asked. There was some in quiry to-day for the stock of the Canton Co., and we note sales of 150 shares at sls cash. Nothing was done to day in City O's or Railroad bonds, but City 6's closed at 96 bid, 96 asked for 1875'5; 97 bid for 1886's; 97,',' bid 98 askid for 1890 s; and Railroad bonds left off at 57 bid, 59 asked for Northern Central lSßs's; 81 bid for Baltimore and Ohio 1875'5; 8011 hid for do. 18S5's; and 58 bid, 62 asked for do. 1862'5, (or the extra dividend bonds). In the Mining stocks there was very little done to-day, but they were ail quite heavy. Sales were made ofsoo shares Gardner Hill, 100 at $3. and 400 at $2.90, and it was offered at the close at $2 80 regular way. The last sales of this stock previous to to day were made at $3.50 cash. There were also sales of 200 shares Guilford at 50 cts., and 600 shares Cambridge at 35 cts., these figures being a considerable decline on the previous prices of these stocks. Nothing was done in any ot the other Mining stocks, but there was some inquiry for Springffeld and it closed at $2.05 bid, $2.25 asked regular way. Our political troubles continue to have a decidedly de pressing effect upon business, and the aspect of commer. cial and financial matters is certainly gloomy enough. Money is very tight. The banks are discounting to some extent, but outside capitalists are generally doing very little. Nothing but strictly first class paper will go upon the street at all, and for this description rates range at from Ito 1# per cent, per month. New York Exchange is In demand at 1 to 1# per cent, premium. SALES AT THE BALTIMORE STOCK BOARD. S.ATURAV, December 1, 1860, B AiO.RR.—S9 100 slis. Gardner Hill 850 " " —SB Mining Co., —3. 100 slis.

The New York Poht of Saturday evening says: The stock market is better to day, but as yet, gives no decided signs of returning activity. The Railroad shares close in improved demand and remain very scarce fur delivery.

The State stocks are without material alteration. Mis souris and Virginias are steady, while Tennessees are pressed on the market. North Carolina 9 are 81 bid. The bond list shows an improvement. The money market is more stringent and the distrust of mercantile paper more general than early in the week. Rates are 2@3 per cent, higher than on Saturday. 4 'Gilt edge" names are offer ing to day at 15'aYIS per cent., though at these figures there is more doing. The necessities of the market so far as call loans are concerned,appear to he diminishing, and capital on approved collaterals is much more accessi hie at 7 per cent. The exchange on Loudon closed rather heavy. Leading bills at 104# (slo4# Philadelphia and Baltimore Exchanges are rising. The former is now quoted I#{g£2 per cent.;the latter 2#(gj3. The Express says : The whole month of November shows a great stagna tion in dry goods. The withdrawals from ware house are not fifty per cent, of 1858, while the goods warehoused are larger than in 1858 and 1859 combiucd. In November, 1869, there should have been a large increase shown in all departments, instead of the decrease, caused mainly by political agitation. From this time imports of all kinds must he expected to show a decrease, as all orders which could be countermanded, have been disposed of. The week closes upon a money market indicating a want of confidence in the future, and of inability to meet daily maturing payments. On call with prime collaterals, which few mercantile borrowers possess, the rate is 7 to 9 per cent., with special loans at 6 per cent. Upon miscel laneous collaterals, borrowers at call pay as high as 10 per cent. Prime endorsed hi lis pass at 12 per cent., for 6u days and under, but the great mass of transactions out of bank, are at 12 to 15, and a good deal at 18 per cent.—and so on up to 3 per cent, for single names of good standing. Relief cannot be expected until the effect of our politi cal and financial troubles is fully developed in Great Britain, from whence, within ten days, disastrous news is to come. They arc wholly unprepared for the news from this side, and the first movement will be an advance in the bank rate of interest, attended by lower prices f<r cotton and breadstuff-', and diminished currency for hills drawn against bceadstutls ami cotton. A good deal of Exchange will be returned protested for con acceptance, throwing a new and troublesome element into the money market. The coming sixty days are to be lull of events having a vital bearing upon private fortunes, as well as upon the political existence of the country, and will he attended by an agitation fatal to cheap money, save in the direction of call loans, the delusive snare is general ly fatal to borrowers. The fallowing will show the movement in foreign dry goods at ttiis port in November for six years: Entered for Withd'n from Entered for Consump'n. Warehouse-.

Both buyers and sellers are holding off, awaiting further developments from the South anil the assembling of Congress. The money market is quiet and, if anything, easier. There is more disposition on the part of capitalists to discount, and the banks are liberal in the distribution of their fa vors. The Charleston Mercury of Friday says : The suspension of all our banks yesterday—a measure of mere policy, and not of necessity—was tlie theme of general congratulation among our business community. As an instance of the perfect soundness of our Charleston banks, we append the statement of one of them—the Union Bank—at the close of yesterday 's operations: Exchange—Sterlihg $19,430.35 Exchange—Northern (duo within 30 days).. 362,342.13 Exchange—Southern (due within 30 days).. 233,966.96 Coin 181,774 25 balance due by City bauks 42,512.70 Circulation 197,635 00 Deposits 180,850.42 The Cincinnati Gazette of Saturday says: The money market exhibited no new feature to day, in activity being still the leading feature of the discount department. There is a softening tendency on the part of bankers, but they still take paper very sparingly and cautiousiy. The demand also continues moderate. Bu siness men receiving no encouragement to offer paper are holding back. The limited ilemand.for loans is also attributable, in some degree, to the stagnation in busi ness, there being no inducement at present, as matters appear, to operate in any article. There is a hopeful feel ing among bankers, with a slow but steady growth of confidence. 

BALTIMORE M A RKETS. SATUKDAT, Dec. 1, 1860. COFFEE —There is something doing in Coffee, hut the market for it is heavy, and prices have evidently a downward tendency.

Ohio Super at $5 per bbL, at which figure more could have been had There was some inquiry for Howard Street Super but no sales were made. It was held generally at $5 12V, hut there were no buyers at over $5 per bbL, and it may be quoted as closing at this rate.

CITY RAILROADS IN CHARLESTON—DO NOT WANT NORTHERN CAPITAL.— The following is published in the Charleston Mercury of Monday 7 last: Tofhe Editor of the Charleston Mercury ; Numerous inquiries being addressed to me byour citizens, from time to time, with regard to the con struction of the proposed street railways in our city, and to which end.a petition had been sent to the Legislature a year ago for a charter, by a few "other gentlemen and myself, permit me to request of you the insertion of the subjoined letter in reply, as closing my connection with said petition and charter. I learn that other parties here may take up the enterprise, and 1 most sincerely trust they will receive the sanction of the Legislature and the endorsement of our community, when the proper period comes to commence tbe work. 1 earnestly believe that street railways will he of immense value to Charleston in very many respects : CHARLESTON. S. C., October 20, 1860. Messrs. 11. L. <f' IF., Philadelphia : GENTLEMEN: Vour letter of the 6th inst., is at hand. You are misinformed as to mv having a charter for city railroads for this city. I had con templated securing a charter at the "session of the Legislature in December next, in conjunction with parties in your city, but having found out in time that they were Black Bepublicans, the enemies of ray country and civil liberty, as that party evident ly is, I have for the present abandoned the enter prise, as they will surely involve the country in bloodshed by tbe election of Lincoln. We of the Sonth are looking to events in the next few months tar more important to us and to the human family than street railroads. Respectfully, your obedient servant, (Signed) Wit. M. 

LAWTON GOLD IN ARKANSAS. —An Arkansas journal an nounces the discovery ot' gold in that State, and says that in the town of Des Arc there was a report of the discovery of gold by the workmen engaged at the Artesian well. The excitement occasioned by this rumor is easier imagined than described. Several small pieces have been dug out which are pronounced by those posted in such matters the genuine 6111(1. Should it prove to be so, the vein is a rich one. The British government, through the Consul at Boston, has presented Captain Wilson, of the Min nie Schiffer, with a valuable gold chronometer; Mr. Connonton, the mate, with a telescope; and $lO to each of the crew; also, a liberal compensation is made for the demurrage and subsistence of the crew and passengers of the Connaught. Quite an excitement wa9 occasioned at Chester town, Kent County, one night last week, by some one placing a letter, hinting at insurrection, under Ihe door of a prominent citizen. It was found out to be a joke of some of the wags of the town.— Dangerous fun, these times. The Sheriff of Savannah, Ga.. has decamped with some SB,OOO of the city's funds. LATEST NEWS. TELEGRAMS.

Day of Ilnmilation nml Prayer. RICHMOND, Dec. I. —Gov. Letcher intends request ing the clergymen of the State to appoint a day of humiliation and prayer. CITY INTELLIGENCE. THE PAGODA. —.Most of our citizens are aware that there is an institution in our city styled the Pagoda. We call it an institution for want of a more definite term. On many of the corners of the streets, on old buildings, sheds, and on boards, erected expressly for the purpose, are daily pasted up post ers covered with large letters, informing the pub lic that "unrivalled attractions" are ottered at tbe Pagoda. By this means the public, of course, are aware that such a place as the Pagoda exists, but many ol them have no idea, perhaps, of what the Pagoda is. Only those who have visited the .Muse um have a correct idea of the character of the place. When it was first started the interi or of the building was slightly changed. In the Southeast corner of the dress circle a counter was erected, and behind this shelves were placed for the purpose of holding liquor bottles. All the apur-.. tenances of a complete bar were secured and ar ranged. The proprietor employed the services of a jig dancer, two or three female and half a dozen ol male singers, and the Pagoda commenced. The house was crowded the first night. It was announ ced, not by the posters, hut on the streets by the initiated, that young ladies would carry around lager and other liquors to tne audience, and sure enough, when the performance commenced, there were three or four lorettes in waiting to serve the gentlemen, these femah*9 are still nightly to be seen moving among the crowd who fill the seats, dealing out liquor of various kinds to order, and indulging with those who are depraved enough, in obscene and filthy language. With debauched faces, covered with paint, they frequent, every part of the room and answer eacli beck or whistle. The audience, for the largest portion, is generally com posed of youths, between sixteen and twenty, whose principal topic of conversation is the waiting girls. The performance usually commences with an ex hibition of Ltliiopian singers. This is followed by a female songstress, a nigger dance, a low comedy pong, nr a banjo performance. Er*ry expression in the songs which can be possibly construed into vulgar inuendo is eagerly singled out by the audi ence, who greet it with shouts. In many cases when the singer retires alter giving a song contain ing such an expression, an encore is raised, which is brought about by "cat calls," "tigers," " sharp whistling," and demoniac yells. The females gen erally sing pieces of the sentimental cast, and these frequently the very gems of song. About mid way in the night's performance the veiled songs tress appears. A female wearing a slight mask, dark colored, steps upon the stage, and she is re ceived with shouts and clapping ol hands. With the most ordinary ability she labors through "'Ma ry of Argyle" or a piece of a similar character, and then retreats amid the plaudits of the audience, which b}' this time has grown more excited from the frequent indulgenee of "lager" or other drinks. The "cat-calls," whistling and yells amount to the terrific, and the veiled songstn ss makes her ap pearance in response, and sings another song, when she is allowed to retire. The rest of the night's performance consists in jig dancing or the singing of fjuciKi respectable songs. During the interim between the falling and rising of the curtain, the audience supplies itself with lager, whiskey etc., and segars (mostly of the rankest quality), and by the time the performance is over the room is full of the fumes of tobacco and liquor, and many of the crowd are intoxicated. Occasionally a quarrel takes place between two or more, which would no doubt result in a fight but for the prompt interfer ence of the police, a couple or more of whom are I generally present, in anticipation that their services will be needed. For immorality and demoralizing; tendencies the I'agoda surpasses in enormity any place which has ever been instituted in our city. The youths who nightly patronize it must eventually be led into all the excesses of dissipation. At it 3 opening, and in fact up until within a short period, the low and rowdy elements of society were regular in atten dance, but for causes best known to tbe manager, a stop has been placed to their visits, and they are now, as the following letter would indicate, refused admission. The letter was sent to Mr. l'ercival on Friday morning last, and a copy of it sent to the Marshal of Polico by Mr. Percival. It is as follows: [OOFY.] BALTIMORE, NOV. 30, 1800. MR. GEORCE PERCIVAI —Dear Sir:—Last night we applied for admission to the Pagoda, and were re fused admission by your ticket agent, after paying our twenty cents. We would like to be informed by the bearer ot this whether it was by your order or not. Respectfully, yours, GEO. P. COSTER, CP.AR ASIIBY, A. HAMILTON, N. RATCLIFFE, J. MULLET, WHIF WHITE, TOM COSTER, FRANK ARNOLD, < —' —l W. W. RATCLIFFE, { SEAL. ) TE "£. (. J FRANK ROMNSON. REGULATOR CLUB. The above named persons are the remnant of the Old Regulator Club, whose haunt was Hollidav street, between Baltimore and Fayette streets.— Mo3t of them live by their wits or the ends of their lingers. \\ hat they did to incur the displeasure of the proprietor of the Pagoda has not transpired, but the tact that they are to be excluded is an evi dence, (very slight,)" that Mr. Percival intends to elevate tbe tone of his establishment. He will find plenty of room to do this before be gains lor it the point of respectability. ONTHE"VAO." —Quite a scene was presented on yesterday evening at tbe Central police station, being the examination ofsixteen men who were ar rested during Saturday night on the charge of being vagrants. To be taken up on the "Vag," as it is termed by those whose habits bring them with in the pall of the law, is tbe most awful disgrace which can tall on loafers. To be arrested as a thief or for a desperate, or even insignificant assault, in their eyes, is creditable. But the "vag" is more than their feelings can bear, and the greatest scamp feels a sense of shame when he is charged with this offence. The purlieu* of Marsh market have long been noted for the number of its "bum mers." Fish market space is surrounded with three cent groggeries, and these haunts are tilled day and night with loafers, beggars and thieves. On Saturday night, by direction of Marshal Kane, offi cers visited several of these haunts and made six teen arrests, most of which took place in the houses kept bv Mrs. Callony and Mr. Leonard. The first one arraigned was Thomas Williams. Thomas is about thirty-three years of age, but looks as though he might be sixty, lie spoke earnestly of his in dustry, and wanted his hands examined as evidence. But the evidence was against him and he received 60 days. The next was Tone Truxton. Tone had seen better days—a few years ago he wore n ruffled shirt and patent leathers, but those days are past, and now he is not troubled with undergarments, and his shoes, when ha is lucky enough to have a pair, are of coarse material. He was well acquainted with the Justice—knew liiui like a book—called to mind scenes which took place years ago—but it would not do. Tone had been excused too often before and this time he got sixty likewise. Charles Clifford was not a denizen of the city. He was a visitor, in search of employment, and would leave for elsewhere if discharged." With this understanding he was told to depart. Henry Wilson followed the sea, and was to leave on a voy age around the world on Tuesday, or else go down the bay to dredge for oysters. Be had the two sit uations offered him, and if the magistrate would discharge him he would come to a conclusion which to take by morning. Just then he was inclined to dredging, although he had a strong desire to visit foreign ports. He was discharged with the injunc tion to make himself scarce in the city. Thomas Ward did anything which his hands found to do.— They too frequently found door mats and other ar ticles to carry away. He received 60. James Clarke was picked up by accident. He was a reg ular laborer; discharged. Charles Wesley Arm strong and William McConnelly, were gentlemen ot leisure. Work was very scarce and they were compelled to cease from their labors. They looked forward to better times, when bread would be easier to get. The Justice told them that the time bad arrived, and sent them to board with Captain James for 60 days, Henry S. Hoggland was a New BALTIMORE, MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1860 \ ork thief. He deni'd the suit impeachment, but tli.; evidence was against film and lie was sjnt over for the sixty. Joseph Harriznn had evidence to prove that lie urn feed hard and drank ditto. In consideration of his working he was discharged with the admonition not to drink. Stafford I'lunkett was from the county of Ross Common, Ireland, never begged or stole, and earned an honest living by doing little jobs for Mr. Leonard. He was a small eater and took a"drap" occasionally during the day. He got CO days.— Richard Dee had made enough ol money to buy half of Baltimore, but bis generosity had been his ruin and whiskey his only comfort in his misfor tunes. He was houseless and friendless, and the Justice provided him quarters for 60 days. Chas. Mott was a New York thief, and he was sentenced to 00 days. Joseph Emuiett, Richard Duff and George Bradley were sent over for G months.

AN IRISH WEDDING. —There was a wedding at the house of Patrick Lahan, No. 7 Pleasant street, and there was a bowl of punch, and in the end a few punches-without bowls. Thns. Rawlins held opinions on a subject which were at variance with the opinions entertained by Thomas Flana gan, and Mr. Flanagan went to work to beat the opinions of Mr. Rawlins out of his head. This was no easy job, particularly as a portion ot the ladies coincided in sentiment with Mr. Rawlins, and entered into the argument on his side. Rawlins succeeded in getting out of the house and went to the police station, where he secured the services of an officer to arrest the man who had bruised bis head. Flanagan was taken to the station house to await an examination before Justice Hiss. CASE OP DROWNING lnquest .—About 6 o'clock on Saturday evening a little girl named Rebecca Reese, daughter of John Reese, living at Locust Point, was sent to a spring in the neighborhood to get a bucket full of water. Some fifteen minutes after wards a man named Albert Smith went to the spring and found the body of the girl lying in the water, with the head downwards. He immediately pulled her out and tried to resuscitate her, but without success. Ho then carried the body to the house of the parents, where yesterday Coroner Battee held an inquest, the jury rendering a verdict of accidental drowning. ATTEMPTED BURGLARY. —Last evening, soon after dark, an attempt was made to rob the clothing warehouse of Myers Wettgenstine, No. 182 North Gay street. The thieves gained an entrance by forcing one of the rear windows with a jimmy.— They sprang the lock of the money-drawer and took therefrom a small amount of silver. They then selected a quantity of the finest clothing nd carried the articles into thecellar, from which thev could easily have removed them by opening a door on the street. The oliicers came upon the thieves unexpectedly and they lied, leaving their "jimmy" behind. AN ASSAULT BY A NEGRO. —Yesterday afternoon two young men, one or them named George Mulhtt happened to jostle against a negro who feltinsulted, and on the young man turning round tiie negro struck kirn a severe blow in the eye, which nearly closed it. Moflitt's companion picked up a brick and bit the negro in the back, when the fellow picked op the same missile and would have struck one of the boys had not a gentleman seized him.— He was taken to the police station, when Justice Hiss ordered hitn to bo stripped and thirty-nine lashes laid on his bare back. The order was most effectually carried out. FIRE IN THE COUNTY.— Burning of the O'reen Sprint/ Hotel. —On Saturday morning about 10,'j o'clock, fire broke out in tbeGreen Spring Hotel, situated on the line of the Western Maryland Rail road, about twelve miles from Baltimore. It ori ginated by the accidental upsetting of a stove in one of the lower rooms, and notwithstanding every exertion was used by those on the premises and the neighbors, who assembled in large numbers, to extinguish the lire, the flames made headway, and in an hour or less time the whole building was consumed. BURGLARY. —During Friday night the dwelling ol Mr. E. M. Onion, corner of Baltimore and Dallas streets, was entered by thieves, and robbed of sil ver wareand clothing ol the value of SIOO. The thieves gained an entrance by forcing one of the window shutters. They ransacked all the rooms of the first floor, and after selecting their booty, helped themselves heartily to cold turkey, chicken and ham, which they found in the pantry, and then washed the good things down with brandy and whiskey, which they took from the side-board. DISORDERLY NEGROES. —On Saturdav night about eleven o'clock, officers Glenn, Harney, and McCahn entered a negro groggery on Dallas street, near Pratt, where they found a number of negroes act ing in the most disorderly manner, and all of them drunk. Tbey arrested Isaiah Sommerville, Jere miah Chaplin, Joseph Myers, Charles Offby, Thom as Smith, Ulias. Williams and Nathaniel Glmn, and took them to the Eastern district station house, where Justice Griliin committed them to jail in default of security, for good behavior. SODDEN DEATH. —Yesterday afternoon, about one o'clock, a man named William McKenny, about sixty years of age, walking along Ensor street, near Monument street, suddenly sunk to the pave ment. Some gentlemen, passing at tbe time, picked him up and sat him upon the steps of a porch, where he died in a few moments. lie was taken to his home, on Ensor, near Madison street, where an inquest was held over the body by Coroner Hall, and a verdict rendered of "Death from disease of the heart." PROPERTY SALES. —On Saturday Messrs. Gibson & Go., autioneers, sold at the Exchange salesrooms, a lot of ground situated on the south side of West Pratt street, near l'aca street, having a front of 30 feet and a depth of 150 feet, running back to Do ver street.

ATTEMPTED BORGLARY.— Between 4 and 5 o'clock yesterday morning, an attempt was made to rob the wholesale grocery and provision store of Mr. Elias N. Gardner, situated on the corner of Frank lin street and John alley. The rear door was.fbrced open with jimmies, but the thieves, it appears, were frightened oil before gaining entrance.

The following, which is cut from a "Down East" paper, is not more irreverent than Burns' Holy Willie's Prayer, which is among our classic poetry and not half as much so as some of the prayers actually offered up by the negrophilist ministers of tlie North: We thank Thee, O sovereign Disposer ol all events, that thou didst put it into the hearts of our fathers in these free States, to sell away their black slaves to our Southern brethren, by rea son whereof we their descendants, having sha ken off that accursed thing to others, ate now delivered from that "sum and essence of all vil lainies," and so are elevated in virtue, and intel ligence, and in all the christian graces, far above the rest of the world, but especially above those—onr Southern friends who purchased slaves of our fathers. We tliank'Theo that Thou didst prosper, these our fathers, and that Thou hast allowed them and us, not only to retain the mo nev we so received, but that Thou hast large ly added thereto. We tliank Thee that Tbou hast put humility in our hearts, so that while we of these free States are a wonderful people, armed against delusion by our intelligence—guarded against temptation by our virtuous principles— defrauding no man—taking no advantage of tbe hireling -giving unto every man that which is just and equal, and protecting and providing for those who have grown grey in our service, we are yet not greatly given to vain, glorious boasting. If we differ from other men by being better than they, and especially from those who hold in bon dage their fellow then, including the tlaves they purchased of our fathers, we would not be unduly puffed up thereby, remembering that we ourselves do not hesitate to make free use of all that the slave produces, either to gratify our palates, or to make a profit out of the same. And we thank Thee that, having permitted our fathers to sell away i their slaves, Thou hast put it into the hearts of us their descendants to set our faces like a flintagaiast ! this bloody system of oppression which Thy hoiy I word never provides for, but constantly reproves i and condemns; and that although in Thy inscruta- I ble purposes, Thou didst permit us, at a former pe- J riod in our history as a nation, to enter into a po- ! litical compact whereby we agreed to this evil thing ol slavery, and thus made ourselves | chieily responsible lor its present existence, Thou hast in these later days enabled us ; to atone for that heinous sin by enacting j personal liberty laws, and so withholding our as- j sent to that unholy compact, into which Thou j knowest, O Lord, wo never would have entered, j but that we were sorely tempted thereto by a hope ! of much gain. And we thank Thee, that Thou hast j not only thus implanted in our breasts this love for ! the slavo, but that Thou, who seest all hearts, well | knowest that we love also the master, whom wo j have never pursued with taunts and reviiings. i And we thank Thee, Sovereign Ruler of the world, with whom are the issues of life, that into what ever depths of woe this great and prosperous na tion may peradventure he plunged by our viola- j tion of the compact which holds it together, Thou wilt not esteem us responsible therefor, but in con- ! sideration of the great love we bear to tbe negro, j and of the great good we intend to bestow upon j him, Thou wilt pardon and esteem as of small no ' count, the overturning of the government under ] which we live. THE 

GREAT GALE—SIXTY-SEVEN LIVES KNOWN TO BE LOST. The captains of vessels who were out in the terrific gale of last Saturday aud Sunday-, rep resent it as the severest by far of any experienced for many years past, it was so on Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and, it we may judge by the number of disasters reported, it must tiave been so on Lake Ontario as well. Such was the force and height of the waves that the crew were obliged to cling to the rigging for safety, and it was cer tain death for them to lose their hold. The loss of several lives is already reported as having occurred in this manner. Everything on deck, even lo hawsers weighing tons, were swept overboard as so many shavings would have been. The man at the wheel was in all cases lashed to his post in order to enable him lo retain his position. Bulwarks on each side were cut away in order to give the heavy seas a free channel of escape from the d.cks. The wind and the waves, however, were not the only dangers that threatened, for the weather was so piercingly cold that the vessels be came in a short time a perfect glare of ice, the rig ging was encased in it, the icicles hung thick and long from the spars, and the decks were often cov ered with ice to the depth of six inches. Of the many lives that have been lost and the large amount of property that lias been destroyed, no itcuiisldernbß ru .ii u ., : uf , >. <L. cold. We have reports of vessels which were wholly unmanageable because everything about them tiad frozen so stiff that they could not be con trolled. This was tbe case with the two lost near Goderich; the crew stood by and saw them driven upon the shore to certain destruction, without be ing able to avert their fate in the least. Many of tbem who did not lose their lives altogether, have been so badlv frozen that they will be maimed for life. Last week was by all odds the most disastrous of the season, or of many seasons, to the Lake ma rine. More lives and more property have been lost than during the same length of time for years and years. Many vessel men say they have never known such a storm as that with which the week closed, for more than twenty years, that they have been on the Lakes, while others say that it has never been equalled since 1844. Here follows detailed accounts of the various dis asters, of which we have already given brief state ments. It concludes as follows: We can now begin to form some estimate of the number of lives that have been lost by this terrific gale, though this estimate must necessarily be im perfect. Where the crews of vessels have been lost, we estimate the number at 8 for a crew, which will rather fall below than exceed the true number. The following are those who are lost so far as known: Propeller Dacotah, 21; propeller Jersey City, 17; propeller Cuyahoga, 1; brig F. 11. Gardner, 1; schr. Marco Polo, 8; schr. Wm. Maxwell, 7; schr. Tornado, 8; schr. Omar Pasha, 1; total, C7.—De troit Free Free*, Nov. 28. CAPITOL EXTENSION. —The question as to whether the columns of the Capitol extension can be obtain ed in monolithic shafts, of American marble, Beems to have been definitely settled by the rapid deliv ery of these shafts from a quarry in Baltimore county, in the State of Maryland. Twenty of these columns have already been delivered in single pieces. Three of them are finished, placed in the building,and crowned with their beautiful capitals; a considerable portion of the superincumbent en tablature is erected, with a portion of the ceilings, thus giving an earnest of what these stupendous porticoes are to be when finished. There will be one hundred columns in all, supporting entabla tures and marble ceilings, deeply panelled and enriched alter the ornate manner of the Corinthian order. Nine more of monolithic shafts are now in hand, and there appears to be no question that the enterprising contractors will be able to deliver them as rapidly as they can be wrought and placed in the building. Each of these monolithic shatts weighs, when finished, above thirteen tons. The foundations for the massive pile of steps which are to form the approaches to the north and south wings are constructed, and the whole work of the exterior appears to be rapidly approaching completion. The finish of ihe interior of the building has also been prosecuted with vigor during the past season. The marble skirtings of the four grand stairways have been entirely finished, and the ornamental sky-lights which crown them, and which are all composed of iron, are completed with the exception of the glazing, which is to be of stained glass. It is to be hoped that this also will be done before the meeting of Congress. The past season lias bepn one of activity on this great work, and we sincerely hope that Congress may furnish the means to prosecute it without hin drance, until the whole shall be finished on the magnificent scale upon which it has been projected. —National Intelligencer. TUE METHODIST EPISCOPAL AND TIII: METHODIST PROTESTANT CHURCHES OF VIRGINIA. —On Thursday last in tho Virginia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Dr. Smith, from the Committee to respond to the address from the Messenger of the Methedist Protestant Church, (Dr. McGwigan,) presented a report and series of resolutions, which were laid over for consideration. The report sets forth ihat there is a strong and mutual desire for union between the two branches' of the Methodist family in the South; —that the cause of the former alienations have, to a great ex tent, been removed by what has since transpired,— that the still existing attachment of the Methodist Protestants to their system of lay delegation, is the only remaining barrier on their "part, and the ex tent to which the M. E. Church, South, may be willing to remove it, the committee are unable to say. The report points to the system of lay-opera tion, which, to a considerable extent, has already been established in the Virginia Conference, and the growing tendency in the same direction, as lacts which would perhaps justify such expectations on the part of the Protestant Methodist, as to af ford them a present satisfaction. If they should be content to act on the basis of these facts and expec tations, they will be gladly responded to; or if thev have any distinct proposition to submit, and for which the assent of the General Conference may be necessary, the Virginia Conference will in accord ance with its declared sentiments, and desire for this Methodist union, giveeff'orts for the promotion of the object on lair ond just terms. 7At the special election in Clarke county, Virgin ia, on Monday last, for a delegate to the Legisla ture to supply the place of A. M. Earle, Col. B. Morgan, Democrat, was elected over Maj. H. M. Nelson. They both ran as anti secessionists. The vote was 224 short of that polled on the day of the Presidential election. Messrs. Thornton, YVard & Co., American mer chants at Manchester, England, from whom a com promise of 15 shillings in the pound was accepted in 1857, voluntarily paid the remaining 5 shillings on the 3d of November, thus discharging the whole of their obligations in full. A large dry goods importing house of Philadel phia wiites to a Norfolk, Va., firm as follows: "YVe shall move our house to Charleston, S. C., or Baltimore, Md. Business here has completely sus pended. YY'e have thousands of dollars out and cannot collect one dollar." The steamship Montgomery, which arrived at Savannah last week, brought 180 boxes of Sharpe's patent carbines, 1,800 in all, and 40,000 conical ball cartridges, for the State of Georgia. They came from Hartford, Connecticut, and were forwarded immediately to Miiledgeville. McNair's Young Ladies Seminary, near Summit, Miss., was burned on the morning of Monday last, and one of the pupils perished in the ffamef.

SECESSION SERMONS IN NEW ORLEANS. NEW ORLEANS, NOV. 29. —Thanksgiving Day was devoutly observed in this city. An immense concourse assembled to hear Dr. Palmer, of the Presbyterian church, deliver his eloquent aud thrilling discourse in favor of secession, which deeply moved the people. Dr. Leacoek, of Christ's church (Episcopal), picturc-d the unchristian aggressions of the North, and spoke of the hand of God moving to protect his ordained institutions. Intense emotion pre vailed. Abolitionists are daily arrested, 'there is im mense excitement, and the secession feeling mo mently increasing. Disunion is inevitable. MATTERS AT NEW ORLEANS. NEW ORLEANS, NOV. 29.— There has been rather a better feeling in commercial circles during the past few days, and produce transactions were some what increased, but there is still observable an un der current of distrust which time alone can heal. \V e all feel that the North should do something to restore confidence at the South before it is too late. Concessions, that would cost the North nothing, could be made which would diffuse harmony through the South in twontv four hours, and im part in all the avenues of trade a hopeful and buoy ant feeling. And until this is done the prospect ahead must grow worse and worse. ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING—SPEECH OF MR. MEM MINOR!!. CHARLESTON, NOV. 30. —The banks to-day dis counted moderately, and much relief was experi enced by the business community. News of enthusiastic independence celebrations in this and neighboring States is pouring in by erery mail. A palmetto tree was raised to day in Columbia, amid rejoicings, salutes, cannon, the Marsellaise, &c. The palmetto is not found up the country, and this was the first erer brought to Columbia. Another immense meeting to-night, at Institute "" ..IS—..- Mammmrop Fnrmc-lj- Commissioner fo Virginia, and others. Mayor Macbeth presided. Memmingerdelivered a master ly speech, He counselled coolness above all things, and said if an unauthorized attempt were made to take Fort Moultrie, the garrison were in honor bound to defend it; but when Carolina, as a retir ing partner of the Union firm, formally claimed the forts as her share of assets, then . if not granted, let the Governor say to the young men of Charles ton, take those forts—(wild applause)—and he doubted not in twenty-four hours they would be in possession of the rightful owners. Those forts were ceded to the governmant by the State to pro tect citizens of the State. To turn their gtns against the people of one of those States, when act ing under authority of their State, would be trea son. He said he was opposed to undignified haste in secession, but supposed that about three days after the convention met secession would be con summated. All that he conceived was necessary for this end was to repeal the ordinance by which the State consented to be a member of the' Union. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by bursts of applause. Messrs. Hanckel, Richardson and McCraby also spoke. At the conclusion of the meeting another demonstration was announced for to-morrow night, from the Charleston Hotel. 

SOUTII CAROLINA ORDINANCE OF SECESSION. YVe find the following in the Charleston Mercury of Thursday: AN ORDINANCE to repeal the Ordinance passed in Convention, on the 23d day of May, 1788. Wlurcas, The Constitution of the United States was adopted in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, ensuro domestic tranquility, pro vide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to our selves and our posterity. And whereas it has ceased to effect any one of these objects, it is now the interest and duty of South Carolina to repeal the acts by which she en tered into the Union. Therefore, we, the people of the Stato of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the Ordinance passed by us in Convention on the 23d day of May, 1788, whereby the Constitu tion of the United State of America was ratified; and, also, all acts and parts of acts of the General Assembly of this State ratifying amendments of the said Constitution; and, also, the words, "and of the United States," contained in the IV. Article of the Constitution of this State, and in the amend ment thereto ratified on the Gth day of December, 1834; and, also, all acts of the Congress of the United States, and all acts and parts of acts of the General Assembly of this State made in conformity with and to carry out the said Constitution of the United States and of the amendments thereto, be and the same are hereby repealed, abrogated, abolished and made utterly null and void, and not binding upon this State, its officers and citizens. And be it further ordained, that the Governor of this State do appoint an agent to negotiate with the Federal Government of the United States for the retrocession of all places in this State, which have been heretofore ceded to the United States for the erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock yards, and other purposes, and for the rendition thereof; and for the rendition of any other property to which this State is entitled. And the General Assembly of this State shall fix and provide a suit able compensation for the services of the said Agent. Ard be it further ordained that the second arti cle of the Constitution of this State be and it is hereby amended, by adding thereto a fourteenth section, as follows: Section 14.—The Governor shall have the power, by and with the consent and advice of the Senate, to make treaties, and appoint Ambassadors and Consuls, and all other officers of this State, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be estab lished by law. And he shall have power to fill all vacancies that may happen during tho recess of the Senate,-by granting commissions, which shall expire at the end of the next session, lie shall receive Ambassadors and all other public Min isters, and shall commission ail the officers of the State. And be it further ordained, that the General As sembly of this State shall forthwith elect two dele gates, who, together with the delegates now com missioned to represent the people of this State in the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, shall go to Atlanta, in the Common wealth of Georgia, or to any other place to which they may be invited by the delegates from other States desiring to form a new Union Confed eracy with this Commonwealth, and there form with them a Congress: And shall then and there propose to said CoDgress to adopt as a temporary form of government, "The Articles of Contedera tion" adopted by thirteen States on the Bth July, 1778, except the first article, and the "style" there in mentioned, wherever it afterwards occurs; and the fourth section of the sixth article; and so much ul the ninth and tentli articles as requires the "as sent" and "consent" of nine States; and the elev enth article, and the whole of the thirteenth article, saving the first sentence thereof.

And be it further ordained, that the General Assembly of this Commonwealth shall forthwith enact all such laws, and take all such measures as may be necessary to carry into effect this ordinance, and secure the welfare and safety of the Common weal:!) of South Carolina. TIIK REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON. YVASHINOTON, NOV. 30.—Letters from Charleston, S. C., per cxpresss, received to-night, speak of South Carolina as out of the Union, and that the North can mako no concessions which she will accept. To say the poorer classes will not suffer, say the writers, would be absurd; but the wealthy will assist the distressed. But how will it be with the North? South Carolina, taking the lead, will be follow- eil by Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, tbon come Virginia, Maryland, Arkansas, Louisi ana and 1 exas, forming a mighty Southern Con federacy, having for immediate acquisition the bordering Mexican States and the gem of the An tilles in perspective. Direct trade will be opened with Europe, and it need not create surprise if the next steamer at Charleston from New V r ork, expected hourly, will, as soon as her cargo is discharged, be sent to Liv erpool direct with passpngers and cotton. A gentleman in Georgetown, South Carolina, has paid five hundred dollars for Minie rifles to equip a company, and has presented a large piece of ordnance, imported from Europe, to one of the artillery companies. ( A lady imitating that brave and patriotic lady, Rpbecca Mntt, of revolutionary fame, has present ed a company in Charleston with a large amount. The Charleston military companies hare en gaged C. Metzler van Eeklen, one of Louis Napo leon's experienced disciplinarians, as instructor. Companies are drilled every night and are mak ing every preparation in case they meet with trou ble or interference. Judge Magrath will be presented with a costly silver sot on his return from Greenville. He is likely to be the next Governor of the State, or the first President of the Palmetto Republic. The report that the South Carolina railroads are about discharging a large number of hands is ex aggerated. The usual number dispensed with at. this dull season in the State will go, and no more. Too South Carolina banks have plenty of coin, and their suspensions are from prudential considera tion alone. The Charleston Courier of the 2Sth, (conserva tive) says that Gov. Gist's message will meet with general approval and acceptance throughout the State. Washington, Nov. JO.—Reports from KEN tucky are favorable to union, hut coupled with the proviso that the North shall furnish better guaran tees for good faith for the future, and repeal all sta- antagonistic to the constitutional rights of the South. The latter considerations are attached to all resolutions adopted at union meetings lately held in Kentucky. A large number of members arrived to day, and are scattered about equally among dill'orcnt hotels. The universal expression is that things are dark and glnomv, with no gleam of sunshine yet. Mr. Boulignv, representative from New Orleans district, goes for union. 

SPEECH or HON. JAMES OUTIIttIE DELIVERER AT LOUIS VILLE ON THE 26TH OP NOVEMBER. Mr. Guthrie appeared upon tbe stand and took a seat beside the chairman and was vociferously cheered He ro3e and said, in substance, as fol lows : FELLOW CITIZENS: We have been called here to take into consideration the alarming condition of our country North and South. Now for the first time in the history of America has a political panic arisen—a panic that is striking down the fortunes of the first men and depriving the laborer of his wages. No consideration of the character of the individual presiding over this meeting should weigh in the momentous question we hare met to discuss and consult upon. The election of a sectional President by a sec tional party of one section of country was not the groat grievance which we have to complain. It was the organization of a sectional party at the North unfriendly to the institutions and interests of the South. But what is the election of a sectional President with an antagonistic Senate and House of Representatives ? He cannot appoint an officer without the sanction of one, nor receive an appro priation of public moneys except through the other, and by their consent. Should the election of a sectional President stul tify the progress of a country like ours, a country whose progress is without a parallel in history ? With the election of a single man, what have we to fear ? [A voice, "everything."] 1 say we have a great deal to fear if we fail to do our duty. But we have nothing to fear if we are true to ourselves and to our country, if we arc ac tuated by the same sentiments that iilled the breasts of our Revolutionary sires. We have a strong minority of friends in the free States—an 1 array of sympathizers and allies, who havegallantiy fought our battles, and now stand in the breach with us. \V bile we denounce the aggressions of the North, is the South nothing to blame 7 Are our skirts tree from tbe causes of this impending calamity? lias tbe South presented an unbroken front with her Northern allies to the enemies? Have we al lowed the conservative people to rally to the sup port of a conservative man? We have much to tear il divided, but nothing to dread if we are uni ted. Here, on the south side of Ohio, a middle State, with the free States on the one side, and the South upon the other, what have we to gain out of the Union, and shall we be driven or forced into an tagonism with either section ? Wo naturally take sides with those whose interests are identical with our own, but we wiil not fight the battles of South Carolina while she is safe home in bed. [Cheers.] When we appeal to those border States, Indiana, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, shall we say they will not listen, that they will not rouse up, and the con servative spirit rally and say to fanaticism South, and to abolitionism North, "Withdraw youruncon stitutional acts; we will work for you with heart and soul; and the remedy for these evils is within, and not out of the Union." Shall this glorious co venant ol our liberties, the Constitution, be aban doned at Ihe first alarm? Lincoln was elected ac cording to the constitutional forms by a sectional minority, because they were united and we were divided, and shall wo then pull down this glorious fabric? Rather let us say to the North, "Retrace your steps;" and to the South, "Slay your hand; the remedy for your grievance is in, and not out of the Union." ine omy man ol tne Revolution who wa3 un faithful was from the North. Benedict Arnold rests under the scorn of the world as a traitor to his country. The greatest of patriots, George Washington, was from the South, if there are going to be traitors to liberty, let them be from the North; let ns stand by the precepts of Wash ington and his noble compatriots, anil rebuke sec tionalism. But let us be calm, temperate, and discreet in ae tion. Let not this glorious nation, that, in its in fancy, with but 3,000,000 people, bearded the Bri tish lion, he divided in its greatness, with 30,000,- 000 people; and let us not he alarmed and fly, be cause of the election of a sectional President, from the Constitution under which we have been pros perous and happy. Reward's doctrine of the "irrepressible conflict," a battle between two systems oflabor, was fallacious. There was no system ot labor so well adapted to the South as ours, and that argument against slavery cannot stand. The Constitution defined the rights of States.— It did not mean that you shall invade your neigh bor's privileges and rights. Such was not its lan guage or intent. If the North will mind its own business, and the South attend toits own concerns, we of the middle States will make an appeal, and rise np and stand between them, and have the laws respected. And we say to our Southern bre thren, let there be no ill blood; stay your hands, we have a great stake in this Union and this Con stitution. Wo have marched together under the stars and stripes, the flag of Union, and we will ever march under one flag. To the sundering of States, and war, and mur dering, aand plundering of each other, is the fesst we are invited to—so we say to the North, retraae your steps; arise, you men of conservatism, anil put down fanaticism North and South. What we do let us do calmly, coolly and deliberately, and let our nation be harmonious and consistent. The meeting was an immense demonstration, and participated in by leading men of all parties. 

LETTER OF HON. ALBERT RUST, OF ARKANSAS. The subjoined is an extract from a letter of Hon. Albert Rust, of Arkansas, to a member of the Leg islature of that State, on the exciting topics of the day: I believe, first, that from the adoption of the Fed eral Constitution to the present moment the South ern people have never had less cause to complain of our Government and threaten its overthrow than they now have. If the most experienced and en lightened statesmen of other countries could wit ness the universal prosperity enjoyed by the people of our own, and at the same time the fear, if not the conviction, which is almost as universal, that the Government to which we owe so much of it, is on the brink of disruption, they would be driven to the conclusion that a general lunacy bad seized upon the minds of the American people. I recog-riize the election of Mr. Lincoln, by less, perhaps, than one third of the votes of the United States, aided by the intrigues of Southern disunion ists, as no justification for a thought of revolution. Elected under the form 3 of the Constitution, those who would resist or defeat by force his inaugura tion would commit the highest crime knowu to our laws. No one who ha 3 read the debates upon the Con stitution and the cotemporary political history of our country will maintain, I presume, the constitu tional right of a State to secede from the Union.— Such a pretension is, in my opinion, an insult to the memories of the wise and patriotic sages who Iramed the Constitution. Our first remedy, under the Federal aggression, as in the case of the Mis souri Compromise, which was pronounced by the Supreme Court otjyfie United State.3 as a nullity, is an appeal in this same Coui t. This failing us, our only resort is revolution. To do this, whenever an aggression is attempted by the Federal Govern ment, 1 am ready to commit myself. Whatever moral inlluence 1 may be able to exert will he in favopof the inauguration of the elected l'resident and the enforcement of the constitutional laws of the United States after his election. in conclusion, I will say that all I am, and have, and hope for, are identified with my adopted State and I am ready to involve them in her destinies. 1 believe that if tho opinions and wishes of nine tenths ot the people of Arkansas are reflected by her representatives at Little Rock and in Wash ington, her course in the present political crisis will he temperate and conservative. Il l stiould he mistaken, and, in opposition to my humble hut hon est and earnest counsels and remonstrances, her ac tion, through her constituted authorities, carrying out the will of her people, should he different, 1 will yield to it a mournful acquiescence.- Respectfully, your obedient servant, A. Rest. 

SECESSION SENTIMENTS —BANK SUSPENSIONS. SAVANNAH, Dec. Judge Eugeuius Nesbit, for merly one of our most conservative citizens, now advocates immediate secession. All the Savannah banks suspended specie pay ments this morning. SESF.SSJON MEETING AT MEMPHIS. MEMPHIS, Dec. I.—A large and excited meeting was held here last night, when resolutions were passed to accept the present as an irrepressible conflict, calling on the Governor to convene the Legislature, and advocating a State Convention and assuring the Southern States that Tennessee will stand by the action of a Southern Convention for weal or woe. A 

SUGGESTION. A correspondent of the National Intelligencer suggests that a commission of six of the best men of the country ho appointed to visit the South Caro lina Convention and endeavor to bring about some form of settlement of the troubles between the North and the South. He says: General Winfield Scott; Edward Everett, of Mas sachusetts; James T. Brady, of New York; Wm. C. Rives, of Virginia; D. W. Voorhecs, of Indiana; Dr. Wm. 11. Mercer, of Louisiana, and Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, would conciliate the au thorities and the people of South Carolina; com mand their respectful treatment and consideration; ensure the wholesome influence of the sober second thought of the entire South, and restore hope, con fidence and amity to the whole country. PRICK TWO CENTS IFram the Philadelphia Ledger of Saturday.] A Sad Disappointment. — A Wife kept from Join ing her' Htteband.— -Persons who were at the depot 0 I ennsylvania Railroad Company, Eleventh and Mar Ire t streets, on Wednesday evening last, witnessed a curious scene—a mother and father preventing a daughter from taking the train in or der to join her husband at St. Louis. The wife has, for some time, been separated from her hus band, on account ot alleged improprieties on bis part, and the lady and her two children have been residing with her mother and father in this city while the husband started for St. Louis, from which place he wrote to his wife to meet him. Nothing lotli, the wife made her preparations, and a3 she (i ew opposed to the reconcilia tion, she was quiet and secret in all her move ments. Money was, of course, the principal oh ject needed to carry out her purpose, and, accord ingly, she helped herself to a sum that was laid away by her father. With this she procured clothing and other articles to be taken to St. Louis to assist her and her husband in going to house keeping. Everything was getting along swimmingly, and the journey was looked upon as accomplished, until, unfortunately for the lady, she was made the victim of another's blunder. On Wednesday afternoon, as the last item of her purchases, she bought, in Spring Garden street, a bonnet, giving in payment a $lO note, out of which she was to have received $2 change. Instead of this sum being handed to her, the milliner gave the whole of the $lO in small change, retaining nothing for the bonnet, ine mistake was not discovered until an hour after the lady left the store, and then the milliner, having gathered from her customer her name and proposed place of destination, hunted up a directory, and thus found several persons ot the name given, and she started on a tour of dis covery. After visiting one or two places which did not prove to be right, she at last bit upon the mother of the lady, who at once suspected tbat her daughter meditated flight. She at once noticed that she had not been home all day, and it was ar ranged that the eleven o'clock train for Pittsburg should be watched. A policeman, from the Fourteenth ward station house, was called upon to act as a "scare crow," (no criminal charge had been made against the lady) ami with several friends, as well as strangers, who desired to witness the discomfiture of theladv, who was flying to meet her husband, the party started for the depot, and a short time before the train was ready to start, the desired person made her appearance with her children and trunks.— When she saw the party assembled to greet her, her joyous look gave way to one of despair, and, without a word of complaint, she accompanied her parents home, vowing at the same time, that sho would yet be off to join her husband, who, no mat ter what his faults might be, bad always been kind and affectionate to her and the children. The mis take in regard to the purchase of the bonnet was altogether unknown to the lady, she being for the first time, at the depot, aware of the tact that too much change had been given her. THE KANSAS TROUBLES. WARSAW, MO., November 30. —A meeting of the people of Benton county was held yesterday at the court house, Mark L. Means acting as Chairman, and Thomas Murray as Secretary. L>. C. Hallow, James Atkinson, M. L. Means, and James C. Barkley, the committee for enrolling and forming a volunteer company, reported eighty-live members, and it was daily increasing. Judge Hallow was elected unaniin<?uslv. The following resolutions were adopted amid the greatest enthusiasm: Resolved, That we, in common with the people <f Li border counties, hail with feelings of the greatest safi faction the prompt and energetic action of Governor It hurt M. Stewart, in sending troops to defend the hom and firesides of the border squatters, at a time when w were wholly unable to do 'o ourselves, f<>r want of arm and Ammunition. Resolved, That wergardthc duty of every law abiding citizen, who feels a pre per respect for the supremacy of the laws and a regard for individual rights, not only to hold himself in readiness to turn out at a moments warn ing, but to give all the aid and assistance to tlo troops now in the field fur our protection in his power to do. Resolved, That when a country is threatened, as this is, by bloodthirsty villains who boldly proclaim their inten tons, not only forcibly and illegally to take our property, but who actually hang up, in broad daylight, in view oi their distracted and helpless families, for no offence under the heavens, our best citizens, and with newly furnished arms from Northern factories, shipped clandestinely to Kansas, prowl over the country, and breaking up all the peaceful relations of whole settlements, turning out gov ernment officers and sheriffs, and chasing away all the law abiding citizens, that we feel proud of the course of our Governor, and also proud toclaim the citizen soldiery of St. Louis, Bonneville, Jefferson, and other military or ganizations of our State, as the bulwark of our safety in time of need. Resolved, That we are glad that President Buchanan has at last seemed to arrive at a proper sense of his duty, by despatching Gen. H irney to Southern Kansas, with instructions to take Montgomery, dead or alrve. Tom Murray left here this morning for the head quarters of the army, and on his return we will have late and reliable news. f From the New York Herald. ] THE
