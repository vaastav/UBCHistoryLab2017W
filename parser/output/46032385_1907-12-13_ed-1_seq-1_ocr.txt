WASHINGTON LETTER COMMENT ON CURRENT TOPICS HOME DEPARTMENT WHETHER COMMON OR NOT NEWS OF THE WEEK STRANGE! The Wall Street Journal says: "It Is no conclusive argument against federal licenses for interstate corporations that the idea came first from William J. Bryan." Now that is a strange concession on the part of a great paper likojtyio. Wall Street Journal! Would the Journal ser iously undertake to convince its intelligent read ers that the fact that Mr. Bryan endorses a proposition is not sufficient justification for the men and women of America to rise and organize for the defense of their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor? oooo DEEPLY INTERESTED The St. Louis Glohe-Democrat, referring to the president's message says: "But those who read it from beginning to end will find that the national government touches them and touches the rest of the world at more points than they ever dreamed of." It" is because so many men have failed to appreciate their deep concern in government that the republican party has won its victories. Some who have habitually voted the republican ticket seem to have regarded the national government as an affair to be given to the republican party to use as a plaything. The country is to be con gratulated that men are at last awakened to the important part they must play as citizens. 

OOOO NOT YET The Pittsburg Gazette-Times (rep.) explains that when Mr. Roosevelt said: "In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter (tariff revision) is immediately after such (presiden tial) election," he did not mean that tariff re vision would be made by the present congress, whose term expires March 4, 1909. In the opin ion of the Gazette-Tinies the president meant that this tariff revision should be brought about some time later. Did the editor of the Gazette-Times over look the fact that the president did not mention any particular presidential election? Perhaps he meant after the presidential election of 1912 or 191G or 1920. At all events, the men who provide the republican party with its campaign funds, with money wrung from the people through a republican high tariff, know that, whatever Mr. Roosevelt may have meant, the "tariff will not be revised in the public interests go long as the republican party is In power. v I - !

'WOLF f V1 --" & "??? 2Jlli wtlfffMm wMzEmM SPEAKING OF "NATURE FAKING!!" The President's Message b The president's message contains a number of recommendations, the most Important of which will be considered at this time. Ho a3ks for "either a national incorpora tion act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in Interstate commerce .National on certain conditions." Thero Incorporation is a wide difference between "National incorporation" and a license. National Incorporation Is desired by the railroads in order to get rid of state regulation, while a license system properly limited would not interfere with state regulation. National in corporation would 

SUBSTITUTE a national rem edy for a state one, while a license would simply ADD a national remedy to the state remedy. As a matter of fact, wo do not need either national Incorporation or a license system to control railroads Congress already has plenary power to regulate interstate commerce, and congress can without either national incorpora tion or license authorize the interstate commerce commission to ascertain the value of the rail roads, it can" prevent the issue of watered stock and it can provide for the reduction of interstate rates. No new systems are needed to secure all the federal control of railroads that may be needed. So far as railroads are concerned the license system is unnecessary and national incorporation not only unnecessary but not to be thought of. It would be a gigantic step to ward centralization and full of peril. The peo ple should resolutely refuse to surrender the. power now vested in the state to control com merce within its borders. The president suggests national charters or, license for large interstate commerce corpora tions. He prefers national charters but would, as a Monopolies second choice, favor licenses if national charters arc not deemed advisable. Here again the two systems should be kept distinct. Wo do not need to charter interstate commerce cor porations but wo do need a license system which will prevent monopoly. The president has at last drawn the line at monopoly and in so doing has accepted the democratic position. In the . democratic national platform of 1900 the private monopoly was declared to bo Indefensible and intolerable and the license system was suggest ed as a Temedy. In speaking of monopolies tho president says: "No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or Interstate commerce that Is formed for the purpose of, or whoso operations create, a monopoly or general control of the production, sale, or distribution of any one or mor of tho prime necessities of life or articles of general use and necessity. Such combinations aro against public policy; they violate the common law; the doors of the courts are closed to those who are parties to them, and I believe the con gress can close the channels of interstate com merce against them for Its protection." This is exactly the democratic position and the demo- ' i (idUi-.ijii:AM,--T :- uHMMnL,m i....ifc
