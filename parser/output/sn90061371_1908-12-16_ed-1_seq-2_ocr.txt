Rockville, Conn., has the distinction of being the first town to arrest an air ship for disorderly conduct. Some one has reported seeing a sea serpent off Newport, but maybe, after all, it was Jnet the back bone of winter wiggling Into place. In prehistoric times, says a Chicago lady lecturer, woman was mentally the superior of man. Is she arguing that something has happened since? The simplified spelling board wants us to Bpell It "det." Of course that makes it easier to spell, but not any easier to get out of a Bpell of It. A man In Chicago has been ordered by the court not to speak to his wife for two weeks or allow her to speak to him. Which one was the plaintiff ? The daughter of Lombroso Is com ing to this country to study our pris ons. We may be thankful, after all the other fulminations against it, that she isn't coming to study our society. All the world is ready to admire the taste of the man who fell in love with a young woman and married her because she thanked him when he gave her his seat and when she turned and sat down "her waist and skirt did not separate." A Philadelphia man left his son-in-law 50 cents with which to buy a rope to hang himself. The beneficiary will probably forego the bequest rather than comply with Its conditions, but It is certainly a terrible tale to come from the City of Brotherly Love. Prof. D. C. Jackson of the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology has been retained by the Massachusetts highway commission to make a report regarding the telephone situation with special reference to the practicability of a reduction in rates and a higher efficiency of service. The official denial of the Abruzzi-El-klns engagement will shatter a ro mance In which two continents were deeply Interested, and many will re fuse to give up the hope that the path of true love may yet be smoothed for the royal lover and the beautiful American girl of his heart. The recent refrigeration congress In Europe has reminded a student of his tory that Francis Bacon made the first experiments in the use of snow for the preservation of meat. The people of New Zealand, who have been largely dependent on refrigerated meat, have shown their appreciation of Bacon's discovery by erecting a statue of him suitably inscribed. A minister recently read a paper be fore a Congregational church confer ence In Boston in which he called at tention to the fact that In the mem bership of 56 churches In that vicinity only one child to each church was born during the year. His conclusion was that Congregational families are ceasing to perpetuate themselves and that Puritan stock is dying out. Presi dent Roosevelt ought to look Into this. At the recent dedication in Bath of a tablet to Edmund Burke, Whitelaw Reld spoke In behalf of Americans in honor of their best friend in Great Britain. Burke has become almost a national hero in America, and it was 'he who phrased moBt eloquently many principles that are part of our tradi tion. His "Speech on Conciliation" is .a difficult piece for schoolboys, but it ought always to be a part of the pre scribed reading of young America. The Ohio-MlssisBlppi coal trade, which persists to-day, is one of the greatest single movements of cargo in the world. From Pittsburg to New Orleans is 2,000 miles, all downhill. Coal in 1,000-ton barges is rafted into fleets and towed down this distance by powerful steamboats at a cost of less than 75 cents a ton, against a railroad rate of about four dollars and fifty cents from Pittsburg to Mem phis for 43 cents, against a rail rate ,of:2.70. The president of the University of Illinois has announced that dismissal will in future be the punishment of hazing, which he denounces as a vio lation of the right of Individuality, provocative of public disorder, in its milder forms nonsensical, and in its coarser forms vulgar, brutal, always demoralizing and sometimes danger ous. Hence, he says, the university cannot .countenance or tolerate it. Such a stand in the opinion of the In dianapolis Star generally Imitated, will soon end the practice. A Chicago burglar broke into a hos pitalpltal and took everything but the patients' temperatures, we presume. Our referendum among the leading personalities of this country on the question, "What Is your opinion of the great men of Europe and America?" has resulted as follows: Washington and Napoleon ane the greatest favor ites, after whom come Hannibal, Cae sar and Charles XII. of Sweden.

"President Roosevelt never shoots in the air," said a member of congress Saturday to another who was asking if there was any thought that the president had bullets as well as powder to fire back at the house and senate if they should rebuke him in a resolution sav age enough to bring a quick fire re sponse. The belief is that the president has material which is contained in offi cial but unpublished reports, which, if made public, would cause conster nation in some fairly high places. It is not to be conceived that Roose velt wants to use this material if he has it, but, for the thousandth time, it must be said he is a fighter, and will hold that self-defense does not consist merely In parrying. One of the most prominent repre sentatives said Saturday that he had no doubt at all that there could be a response from the White House to any censure that congress might in flict, and that he believed some men would be hurt.

GETTING $52,000,000 FOR MOST OF ADDITIONAL APPROPRI ATION WANTED FOR RIVERS AND HARBORS. ALSO COAST DEFENSE NEEDS Organization of Militia Force of 350,' 000,000 Recommended Increase Last Year Was Nineteen Thousand. Washington, D. C. In his annual report Secretary Luke E. Wright of the war department estimates that an increase of $52,000,000 in the appropri ation for the coming fiscal year will be necessary, principally for improve ment of rivers and harbors. The ex penditures lor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908. were $130,706,447.99, and Secretary Wright's estimate for 1908-9 is, in round figures. $189,000 000. The appropriation for 1907-8 was $137,635,847.20. The increase asked lor is largely for river and harbor work, and other public work of a civil character, for which purpose about $24,000,000 is asked. Of the balance, about $10,500, 000 is an additional estimate for the support of the army, military academy and the militia. For military public works, such as fortifications, arsenals, military posts, etc., the estimates call for an increase of $17,800,000. Secretary Wright especially recom mends an addition of 612 officers to the army, and also approves a policy for the elimination from service of all officers who fail to maintain the requisite standard of efficiency. Both of these propositions were before con gress at its last session, and will be strongly urged this year. Strength of Army.

These various items in connection with permanent military plants call for increased appropriations of $18, 868,927. of which amount about 80 per cent is asked for coast defense works, for which about $9,500,000 is required for the United States and $5,400,000 for the insular possessions.
