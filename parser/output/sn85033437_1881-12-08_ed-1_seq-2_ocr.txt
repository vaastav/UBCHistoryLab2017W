LET THE QUESTION BE DEIDED. A year ago, when the Legislature met. it was found that the House of Representatives was nearly equally divided between the two political par ties, and it was evident there would be a hot contest between the Kepub lican3 and Democrats as to which party should organize the House. And it was still more evident that a fierce contest was about to take place between the parties over the election of a United States Senator. The fact that the United States Senate was equally divided, and that the result of an election in Tennessee would pro bably decide which political patty should control the Senate, intensified the interest in that election, and at tracted the attention of the whole country to' the contest. Now, our readers will remember tint there was a contest from Polk County as to whether Foute, a Re publican, or Stewart, a Democrat, was entitled to a seat in the Legis lature. In a political point of view all could see how important it was to the two political parties as to which of these men should be seated, and seated t early enough to partici pate in the organization of the House of Representatives and the election of a United States Senator. It will be remembered that the case went to the Supreme Court on a petition for a mandamus, and that the court came promptly to the front and advanced it upon the docket, taking up the case which had been cut and dried for the purpose, put ting aside all other suitors, many of whom had been begging for years to have their cases tried and their rights adjudicated. It was taken up with out delay. The court.decided, not only to take it up at once and out of its place? but with the least possible tie lay decided that Stewart was entitled to a certificate of election. He got his seat and voted with his party in the election for United States Senator. Now it is not our object to especially criticise this action of the Supreme Court, though we are prepared to say that there -are a many good lawyers in the State who were surprised at that de cision, and who still believe that the executive authority of the State are under our Constitution given the ex-' elusive power of settling who are en titled to certificates of election, and upon failure or refusal to settle that question, that the Legislature alone has jurisdiction of the question. Nor have the legal profession ever been able to reconcile the decision made by that court in the Foute-Stewart case, with a prior decision made by the same court on a similiar question. Again the Supreme Court is in ses sion at Nashville. There is upon the docket a case involving the execution of the laws passed at the last session to settle the State debt. No c ise was ever before a court in this state where so much that was ma terial to every citixen of the State, especially to every tax-payer was at stake. The .interest on the State debt as it now stands is about four teen hundred thousand dollars per annum, in round numbers. The car rying into effect of the law passed to settle the debt, or, in other words, the taking up and decision of the case now pending before the Su preme Court, if decided one way, will reduce the amount of interest one half, or about seven hundred thousand dollars per annum. The State gets a uew loan, or rather further time on her debt and gets the rate of interest reduced from eix to three per cent. Nor is this.alL We learn that there is now about two millions of dollars collected from the people by taxation, which wnen levied by the Legislature, was intended to be ap plied on the new three per cent debt, which they had made possible. This money is scattered throughout the State in a number of banks owned by private individuals. "What sort of security has the State against the loss of this large sum ? We con fess we do not know, but hope that the proper authorities are giving the matter rigid attention. This money is not on special deposit. It can, and no doubt is, being used f or speculations. Now, if our Supreme Court fails to take up and decide this case, then it must wait and take its place on the docket, which means that it will be two or three years, if not longer, before it will be decided. Moreover, the amount of tax to be levied and collected next year is fixed by law, and fixed on the same basis as now col lected. This will increase the de posits, possibly double them, .before the case can come regularly before the court. True,- this will allow a few individ uals to get very rich, speculating, handling and manipulating the mil lions wrung from the people by taxes and intended to be paid on their debt, but how much of it is to be lost ! How many b nks which are now depositories are to " sus pend ?" How much fraud, specula tion and corruption is to grow up before the settlement of tie State debt case is decided, no man can tell. Should a " financial crash " come in the meantime, or even a "stringency in the money market," it needs no prophat to tell that the loss sustained by the failure of Butler's Memphis bank a few years ago, was a mere bagatelle compared with what may be possi ble in the future. Painfully apprehensive, the peo pie of Tennessee are watching and waiting to see what action their Su preme Court will take in this case. The honor, the credit, the material interests, the millions on deposit, all and more are involved in their ac tion. Let them not say after the precedent furnished in the Foute- Stewart case, that this is a political question only, therefore they will not advance and decide it. Let them ia the face of threats to turn them out by a constitutional con vention, discharge their duty and leave the consequences to the people of Tennessee. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Owing to the lateness of the hour when the President's Message was received yesterday morning, we had no opportunity to comment upon it. The verdict of the country will be that it is one of the ablest State papers that has ever emanated from the White House. No paper of a similar character has ever been writ ten, that was more universally read than this will be. It is no disparage ment to say that President Arthur went into office under such circum stance?, that a great many good men looked with deep concern to his course and policy. His whole bear ing, from the sad nineeteenth of Sep tember, we may say the second of July, when a terrible calamity brought him prominently before the country, has been such as to win the confidence and esteem of the people. His in. augural address inspired confidence throughout the land, and the people were preparedto see in his first mes sage to Congress a creditable state paper. But we undertake to say that he has more than met the expecta tions of his most sanguine suppor ters. If his message may be taien as an index to his administration, the country will never have reason to say that the Republicans at Chicago made a mistake when they nominated him for the Vice-Presidency. He . has a clear, frank, vigor ous way of putting things, which is most admirable. He. gives forth no uncertain sound on any question, but makes himself thor oughly understood on all and by all. His clear cut style in stating propo sitions is something absolutely re" freshing in a public man. 1 e can not be misconstrued, as he leaves no room for doubt as to his" meaning. jWd while we admire his style, his soundness on public questions is no less worthy of approval. On finan cial questions he dodges nothing, but places himself fairly and square ly upon the platform upon which he was elected The state ment of his foreign policy leaves no room to doubt that it will be bold and at the same time prudent arid discreet. His expressions in re gard to Indian affairs show that cn this vexed and difficult question he is humane and practical. His . sug gestions touching the Mormon question are pointed and practical. He sweeps away the cob webs be hind which civil service reform is too often obscurely discussed and ap proaches the subject in the light of common sense. It is an admirable paper in every respect, and no intel ligent man of any party, will have any doubt after reading it, that Pres ident Arthur is endowed with the ability to successfully administer the affairs of the Government. Gen. Hood blamed Gen. Cheatham for tke loss of the battle at Franklin, and Gen. Cheat ham says it was Hood's fault W happened to be thereabouts, and our opinion has been that it was Schofield who caused these Confederate Generals to loe the battle. .' ' - A 

IEBTOK'S STRANGE DEATH. Clutching Hi Iteristoad to Keep Persecat Ing Officers From Taking It. Wilmington (Del) News. In a broken voice, Mrs. A. H-Jilc-Glinchey said that on the 16th inst., at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, while up stairs attending her husband, who was ill with fever, she was called down by a strange voice. Upon going down she found the constable in the house. He had clambered over the fence and gotten in through the kitch en door. He said to her : " I have got you at last." . He then unlocked the front door and let in Constables Hickman and Dillin. Mr. Pritchett levied on the goods down stairs, even to the playthings of the child, and as he was about going up stairs 6he stopped him with the exclamation : ';For God's sake don't go up there ; you will kill my husband." The conversation was carried on in a loud tone of voice, and every word was heard by the husband in the room at the head of the stairs. She detailed the goods, including the bed upon which her husband was lying. As she did this she remarked: "Why, you wouldn't take that, would you?" and he gruffly replied : "Yes, I can take that bed, and if you don't get the money in two hours I will take everything from the house." When she went up stairs after they had gone, her husband, who had heard the conversation between her and the officer, exclaimed, despair ingly: "Maggie, it is all up now; they will take everything, and what will become of you?" He soon after became delirious, and remained so until he died. In grief-stricken tones the poor woman told of his ravings; how he would clutch the bedstead to prevent its being taken from under him.
