Tht President's message WM presented to the Senate and House, today by bis Private Secretary, Mr. Glossbrenner. In the House, the meftsage was read by Col. Forney, the Chief Clerk, and in the Senate by the Secre tary. After attending to the great commercial, agricultural and other material prospects of the country, the President asks why is it then that discontent now so extensively pre vails, and the union of the States, which is the source of all those blessings, is threaten «d with destruction? The long continued and intemperate interference of the North ern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States has at length produced its natural effect. The different sections of the Uniea are now arrayed against each other, and the time has arrived, so much deplored (bythe Father of bis Country when toatiie geographical parties have been formed. This does not proceed solely from the cftaim on the part of Congress or the Terri torial Legislatures to ezcludo slavery from the Territories nor from the efforts of the different States to defeat the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. But the immedi ate peril arises from incessent and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the North for the last quarter of a century, which has produced its malign inllncnces among tho slaves, and inspired them with vague notions of freedom. Hence a sense of .security no longer exists around the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile in •urrection. Many a matron throughout the South retires at night in dread of what may befall herself and children boforc the morn ing. Should this apprehension of domestic danger extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the mass of tho southern peo ple, when disunion will become inevitable Self preservation is the first law of nature, and no political union, however fraught with blessings and benefits in all other respects, can long continue if the necessary conse quence be to render the homes and firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure. Soonei or later thehave bonds ofsiyh. a union must be severed. It is my conviction that this fatal period has •ot yet arrived. After referring to the incessant agitation against slavery at tho North, for the last twenty-five years, both by the press and the people, and asserting that the time of Con gress is occupied with violent speeches on this never-ending subject, he remarks, how easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever, and re store place and harmony to this distracted country. This can bo done by letting the Slave States alone, and permitting them to manage their own State affairs, as they on ly are responsible before God for slavery exiating among them, and with which the North has no more right to interfere than with tho similar instotions in Russia or Bra xil. The President still relies on tho good ssnss and forbearance of the people, alleging Mr. Buchanan refers to the feet that the President's province is net to make but to execute the laws. It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession, that the 8taies are denied equal rights with the oth er States in the common territory. But by what authority are these denied? Not by Congress, which has never pesesd, and 1 believe never will pass, sny act to exclude shivery from these territories, and certainly not by the Supreme court, which has sol emnly decided that slaves are property, and like all other property, their owners have a right to take them into common territories, and hold them under the protection of the constitution. The anticipation that Con gress msy pass some lew obnoxious, is no good reason for dissolution. The- President reasserts the power of Con sacred rights of property are secured by the constitution. The most palpable violations of the con stitntii n«l duly which have yet been com vnitted consist in the acts of different state legislatures to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law. It ought to be remem bered, however, that for these acts neither Congress or any President can justly be held responsible having been passed in violation of the federal constitution, they are, there fore, noil and void. It will be the duty of the next President, as it has been my own, to act with'vigor In executing the fugitive slave law again« conflicting enactments of ftate legislatures/ We are not to presume in advance that he will violate his duty, which would be at war with every principle ef iuatice. Let us wait for the overt act. J'he Fugitive Slave Law has been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement of the present Adminis tration. Let us trust that the State Legis sssaxes frill repeal their unconstitutional and sfceeajans acta.

This leads the President to obseite that the election of any one of our follow ckiaena to the office of President does not, of itself afford just causefordissolving the Union. The late election having been held in stiict conformity with the provisions ef the consti tution, »«4JMtify a deUraniaatiea to destroy this very constitution. Reason, justice and a regardforthe constitution, all require that we shall wait for overt and dangerous acta en the part ef the President elect, before resorting to such a remedy. contracting Th President then enumerates the pow ers conferred on Congress by tho federal government, and that these powers may be effectual, it also possesses exclusive right to levy and collect all import duties sad ether lazes, and has adopted effectual means to restrain the states from Interfering there* with. In order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against state enactments, the laws of thea United States, which shall be made in pur suance of the Constitution, and all treaties made or which shall be made under the au thority ot the United States shall be made the Supreme laws of the land and the Judg es in every Court shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws,of any state or territory notwithstanding. The government created by the constitution, and deriving its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several states, has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all states, in the enumer ated cases, that each one of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the United States, but reserved to the ststes respectively or to tho people. To the extent of tho del egated powers, the constitution of the Uni ted States is as much a part of the constitu tion of each state', and is as binding on its people as though it had been texualiy inser ted therein. This government, therefore, is a great and powerful government, invested with all the attril utes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends. It may be asked, then, are the people of the States without redress against the ty ranny and oppression of the general govern ment? By no means. Tho right o( resist in on the part of the governed against the oppression of the government cannot be denied. It exists independently of all con stitutions, and has been exercised at allthe periods of tho world's history. But this distinction must ever observed, be that this is revolution against an established govern ment, and not a voluntary secession from it by virtuo of an inherent constitutional right. In short, let us look tho danger fairly in tho face. Secession is neither more not less thin a revolution. It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution butand still it is a revolution. What in the meantime is the responsi bi'ity and the position of the Executive? liecussion, is bound to take care that the law be faith fully executed, and from this obligation ho cannot be absolved by any human power. But what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part has been rendered imprac ticable by events over which he could have exercised no control? Such at the present moment is the case, throughout the State of South Carolina, so far as tho laws of the United States, to secure the administration ofjustice by means of the federal Judicary, are concerned. All tho federal officers with in its limits, through whose agency alone those laws can bo carried into execution already resigned. We no longer have a District Judge, a Distrct Attorney or Marshal in South Carolina. In fact, the whole machinery of the federal government, necessary for tho distribution of remedial justice among the people, has been demol ished, and it would be difficult, if not im possible, to replace it. The only acts of Congress on the statute books, bearing on this subject, are those of February 28th, 17'Jo, and March 3d, 1807. These authorize the President after he shall have ascertained the Marshal, with his potst comitatw, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case, to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid him in performing this ser vice having first, by proclamation, com manded.the insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time. This duty cannot, by say possibility, be authority exists to issue process and where there is no Marshal to execute it, and where, even if there were audi an officer, the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him. Congress alone has powertodeckle whether the pres ent law cannot be amended so astocarry out snore effectually tW eh/seta of tho COB stituttou. The revenue still continues to be col lected as heretofore at the custom house at Charleston, and should the collector resign, a successor may be appointed to perform this duty. It is not believed that any attempt will be madetoimpel the United States from its there by forces but if in this should prove to be mistaken, the officers in command of the forts have received orders to act strictly on tho defence, In such contingency the responsibility for conse quences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants. Southernproperty In reference to recognising a seceding State as an independent government by the President, he says it would bo a naked aet of usurpation on his part, and it is his duty to submit to Congress the whole question, in all its bearings. The probability of an emergency soon arising when Congress will be called on to decide the question whether it possesses vvu|nl DMv ICllltflll mi Union, authorises him to express the opinion that no such power has been delegatod to Congress, or to any other department of the federal government. It is manifest that there is not among the specific and enumt-r ated powers granted to Congress, and it is equally apparent that its exercise is not neces«ary and proper to carrying into exe cution any one of these powers. The Presi dent declares that, to make war upon State, is at variance with the spirit of the Constitution. After having conquered a State, how are wo to govern it? We could not govern by despotic power, nor could we by physical force compel its people to elect a senator and representatives, and all other duties ap pertaining to a independent State. The fact is that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of the people, it must ore day perish. The President invokeshis countrymen to pause before attempting to destroy the for any human power to save the Union.

By such a catas trophe the hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the world would be destroyed and along night of leden despotism would enshroud the nation. Our example for more than eighty years would not only bo lost but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government, The slavery question like everything, human, will have its day. I firmly believe that it has already reached and passed the culminating point but if in the midst of the existing excitement the Union shall perish, the evil may then become irrepara ble. Congress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recomending to the Legislatures of tho several States the reme dy for existing evils which tho Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation. The President proposes that an explana tory amendment to the Constitution be adopted .by Congress, for tho final settle ment of the true couaiructions of the Con* stitution on these specific points. He pro poses— First. An express recognition of the rights of property in slaves in the States where it now exists or may hereafter ex ist. Second. The duty of protecting the rights of slaveholders in the common territories throughout their territorial existence, and until they shall be admitted as States into Union, with or without slavery. Third. A like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave, who haswithered escaped from one State to another, delivered up to him. Fourth. The validity of the fugitive slave law, enacted for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State laws impairing this right are violations of the Constitution, are consequently null and void. Such explanatory amendments would, it is believed, forever tcrminato existing dis and restore peace and harmony among the States. The President then discusses our foreign relations. Our relations with Spain have been com plicated, by the refusal of tho Senate to ratify the conventionforthe adjustment of the Cuban claim so called. The President reiterates his recommenda tion for tho acquisition of Cuba by a fair purchase. With the exceptions of Mexico our rela tions are generally of a satisfactory charac ter. In relation to Kansas the President says, the desperate band recently assembled under a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion of the territory, to resist the execution of the laws, and to plunder the peaceable citi zens, will, I doubt not, be speedily subdued, and brought to justice. lie recommends a Pacific Kail way, and congratulates the country upon the appa rent diminution of the slave trade. In view of the destitution in Kansas he recoinended to Congress that if any consti tutional measure of relief can be devised that the subject should bo duly considered.

STATE BEFORE UNION. Judge Story gives a graphic picture of what the States were before the adoption of the present Union, and what they would likely be again, is it should be dissolved. "The most opposite commercial regula tions ox'uted in the different States and, in many cases, and especially between neigh boring States, there was a perpetual course of retalitory legislation, from their jealousies and rivalries in commerce, in agriculture, or in manufactures. Foreign nations did not fail to avail themselves of all the advantag es accruing to themselves from this suicidal policy, tending to the common ruin. And as the evils grew more pressing, the resent ments of tho States against each other, and the consciousness thst their local inter ests were placed in opposition to each other, were daily increasing tho mass of disaffec tion, until it became obvious that the dan gers of immediate warfare between some of the States were imminent. "Dut the evil did not rest here. Our foreign commerce was not only crippled, but almost destroyed. Foreign nations im posed upon onr navigation and trade just such restrictions as they deemed best to their own interest and policy. All of them had a common interest to steal our trade and to enlarge their own. They d"d not fail to avail themselves, to the utmost of their advantages. They pursued a system of the most rigorous exclusion ot our ping from all the benefits of their own com merce and endeavored to secure with a bold and unhesitating confidence, a monopo ly of our. The effects of this system of op crations, combined with our political weak ness, was.soon visible. Our navigation was ruined our mechanics wore in a state of inextricable poverty our agriculture was and the little money still found in the country was graduUy finding its way abroad, to supply immediato wants and a state of alarming embarasment, in that most difficult and delicate of all relations—the re lation of private debtors and creditors— threatened daily an overthrow even of the ordinary administration ofjustice. Severe as were the calanities of the war, the pres sure of them was far less mischevious than this slow but progressive destruction of all our resources, all our industry and all our eredit." Will not all these evils be frightfully ag gravated after the Union is dissolved, and to which we must add the incalculable cal amities of civil war.

Columbia, Dec. 5.—During tho discus sion in the Legislature, yesterday, on estab lishing an ordinance bureau, Mr. Rhett said there had been several years in Charles ton eight of the largest size Paixhan guns, which might perhaps be used in taking the Forts. Mr. Marshall said the Stole had 322 light infantry, 50 cavalry, 8 artillery, and 62 rifle companies, making 121 battallions, 56 regi ments, 14 brigades and 4 divisions. Mr. McGowan said the total military force of the State was 65,000. The House passed the bill to provide an military force, without opposition. It authorizes the Governor to call into ser vice 10,000 volunteers. It will be taken up in the Senate to-morrow. The Presidents message is here. It does not create much remark. The people were prepared for the views expressed in relation to secession beforehand and are taking such steps as they deem necessary to meet what ever exigency may arise. The election of Governor will not take place till Monday.
