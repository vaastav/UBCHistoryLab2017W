Poitofflco as teoond-olasi matter THURSDAY, DECBMBBR (1. 100?. SECRETARY WILSONS REPORT The nnnunl report of the Depart? ment of Agriculture wiiH looked for ward to with nn unusual Interest, this year because of tbo prominence or Iho department enmn Into on account of the agltntlon leading to (he adopt? ion of the meat Inspection and pure food laws, both of which the deaprc ment Is expected to enforce. The annual report of Secretary Wilson states that about 1,300 experts have been lidded to the force of tho bu? reau of animal Industry and Inspect? ion is now made regularly In about ...Jt?00 bouses. Aj\ this report how ov\in..t8_. .(or the fiscal year which ended June 30? and the new laws wer,e not enacted till very nearly that date, tho Secretary Is not nblo to Bay much about, their operation. Ho, however Improves the opportu? nity to make some general defense of the criticisms to which Iho I department was subjected because Its j, own Inspectors had not reported long ^ before upon the conditions In the 1 packing houses, which caused such Van outcry when they wore laid bare. J\ Ho says tho law gave the depart- j hi n'cnt no authority to control tho, V sanitary conditions or tho packing hoUscs or to prevent the use of chemicals as preservatives. Its au-1 thdrlty was limited to ante-mortom 1 us?r cot km and inspect Ion of t he corcasB Immediately ufter slaugh? ter. The explanation Is a good one as fas as It goes, hut it must be said that If the department made onu vig? orous report, giving even a hint at, the conditions in tho packing house-. I It might have secured Its extension of . powers and larger appropriations long before It did. Congress might iemore a general suggestion that mu;a money would be desirable. But It could not have Ignored any statement of fact? which would have aroused tije country as did the Nelll-Reynohls report. An examination of the report how? ever, will show how he happened to let the packing house evil escape his notice. It is because his heart is In another part of the work. Wilson is a teacher and scientist. What he delights !s to tc-.c'i the farmer how to raise crops success . fully. .Tltfe introduction mf new methods, crops, methods of increas? ing yields, the testing of new soils to? the purpose of learning what crops are adapted for them and what they need to bring better results the utilization of waste lands, the conduct of experimental farms?these >}-' are the lines of work to which Mr. -Wilson has given the best thought of ;;', his best years. No one could have been found to have done It better. He has endeavored to put American ' agriculture on a scientific basis, and to a great extent he has succeeded. He has carefully given an impetus to methods which will revolutionize tho Industry in time. Secretary Wil? son's work for the farmers has been a great work, well worth doing and . well done. THE MEN OF THE NAVY The statement that -more than 93 per cent of the enlisted men in the United States navy are native born American citizens will be recoived (with a little surprise andmuch gratl fixation, ami may encourage horn* for the fulfilment of the prediction that In the near future all men of that service will he or that descript? ion. There has been a wide spread Impression that u considerable pro? portion of the men, perhaps from a fourth to a third, were of allleu birth ami It Is known that In some other na\les. notubly the British) such con? ditions prevull to an extent which causes some disquitudo to critical observers; or course. It goes without saying that all men or tho navy should bo citizens of the United Hintes. It Is not essential thut they should he native born citizens, but It Is desirable, portly because of Hie character and quality of the men thus assured to the service and part? ly lo have a service which appeals BUCCOBSfuUy to the best classes of (he population. Conditions and life In tho navy have changed greatly within the memory or men now living. Formerly In a wooden sailing vessel, or In one with sails and auxiliary steam power, such us prevailed down to a generation ago, the enlisted men were sailors In the old meaning or V u -word. Now the ship Is u Healing machine of metal, Instinct with steam and electricity, and the crew is composed of engineers and electricians. It Is gratifying lo know that present day conditions are ""at least as attractive as those of old and that nntlve born American cil iy.c-ns, who seek and who desire tho best classes or employment, can be found to fill I ho places In the navy. It ought always lo be so. and the naval service should be a favorite report of men of character and wortli. The enlisted riion should be able lo feel that?like the recruit, in the French or Gorman army?be will he a belter man morally ami physically at the end of his term of service than he was at the begin? ning. Ills mechanical education and training, the disciplining of Iiis mind and disposition, and (he exrerlcimo and observation of the world which he acquires should all be of lasting value to him. There Is to be found nowhere a worthier type of American inunhood than tho officers of the navy. Whether 11 will over he poss? ible for enlisted men generally lu ho elglble for promotion to ofllclnl rank, oven to (he extent that It Is in I he army, may be questioned. There is sotnethhlng to bo said on each side. But at least tho enlisted men may be kept worthy ot the officers. WHO 

BEARS THE BURDEN? Indlscusslng the fact that the var? ious Increases In the wages of rail? road men will foot up nearly a hun? dred million dollars a year, the New York Sun asks the question, "Who will pay?" and answers it as fol? lows: "It Is a very curious and Interesting situation. wjherea.8 in (he case of the coal barons natural laws could not be prevented from Intorvontlng, tho general public, Including the very poor, who In the columns of the press are tho only real consum? ers of coal, paid all the expenses. The peace and welfare demanded by the disinterested newspapers were promptly 'forthcoming and public sympathy was wholly assuaged at public cost. If tho Interstate Com? merce Commission makes a whole Bale reduction of railroad charges at a time when the railroads have felt compelled to Increase the wages of their men to such an extraordinary degree, wi;at Is to be the result? 'How Is the public k> be made to perform Its customary duty and foot the bill? It Is not easy to see; and yet noth? ing If moro certain than that In the long run the 'burden will de? volve on the public. The pl'l ol confiscation Is of oxeccding bitter? ly sb and hard, hard Indeed, to gild." Not necessarily. It may bo that when the sugar trust, the coal trust and the various other combinations which have been holding the rail? ways up for rebates are forced to pay regular rates, tho Increased re? ceipts may reach a figure almost large enough to take care of high salaries of some of the sons of great railroad financiers who get paid for that fact rather than for any services performed In the op? eration of the railroads. ? IN THE HOUSE OF HIS FRIENDS" "Decent :ncii and women every? where must stand aghast at tho Dona Oilman murder In Dayton. Crimes or this tort are altogether I too frequent. If a few of the beasts I who perpetrated them could be caught and summerlly be ushered out of the world, whose air they have no right to 'breathe and whose soil they pollute with their footsteps, there might be fewer tragedies of this dreadful character In the fu? ture." ?No, kind reader, tho foregoing is not a quotation from the columns of the Corslcana (Tex.) Courier, nor is It a red-hot editorial shot from a Georgia contemporary. It Is the palm and unbiased opinion of the rock-ribbed lime* Starr, staunch and rock-rlbed upholder ? of Republican <!()>?!lines. Including the ones which essentially fallow an enforcement of tin- vengeance-dictated war amend? ments. Can It he. that a grout white light Is beginning to strike tho vin lon of our negrophlre cdnteninora rles of the North? So r.ir Hh we can recall the Times Star and tin? Atlanta newspapers are about the only ones in the country which openly espouse the lynch law method o*. dealing with even those who com? mit tho crime against womanhood. Can It be that the time will come when the 'South will have to adopt resolutions of censure concerning the treatment: of the negro "In the house of his friends?" SOUTHERN FAIR IN THE NORTH Tho Clnclnatl Cham bor of Coiii-j nicrco has launched a movement to bnvo some time during 1!)()7 "a Southern Fair," at which shall bo, exhibited tho products of tho field factory and farm of the South. The promoters of the sehemu say that their Idea of the fair is to educate tho people of tho North of the great 'Possibilities of the South, and that it would lead to immigration and the Inclining of more capital. There is no doubt but that the South is lest' understood in such agricultural slates as Iowa and Nebraska, than it Is elsewhere, Southern men who have lo travel through that sect-, ion are always impressed with tho ignorance and prejudice by tho worin j lest people, -which is not to he ob-. served In the Eastern or Middle states. If properly conducted there is no doubt that such an exposition would ho of great bonolit to the South. It' would attract attention to the mill? ions of acres of laud that can bo( purchased at one-fifth or one-tenth the prices that prevail in the Central West and would possibly stop to an : extent the migration of farmers to | the new country recently opened in Northwest Canada. And then ever) agency that leads to a more friendly understanding 'between the sections Is praiseworthy. It Is a certainty that If the plans of the people of Clnclnatl are consumated the peo? ple of the South generally would aid in milking the fair a success that the promoters desire. It tooK a long time to get an official denial of the story that Cas:i tro was dying. Hut the fact that U'i aspirants for the presidency of Venezuela have appeared In the last six weeks, was proof enough that. Castro was still In the Held. I Since the prleo of tapioca Is go? ing up you can make your own pud? dings out of corn meal. Not so much for the reason it Is cheaper, but be? cause It Is so much better. Reports that Congress will not do much Is not. surprising. Senator elect, Jeff Duvls Is not .vet ready lo clear the decks for action. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE .A Hoosovolt document Is habit? ually characterized by little moral disquisitions of obvious and undis? puted truth. In this one, as in otners, thore Is a liberal sprink? ling; of easy platitude.?Richmond Times Dispatch. Taken as a whole, the message Is a most Interesting document. It may not lend to much legislation at this brief session of Congress. I but it. sets forth admirably. from the president's point of view, "the state of the Union."?Washington 1 Post. Tho message is characterized throughout by- that courage with which tho president habitually faces public questions.

President Roosevelt's message read on yesterday before the two branches of Congress is an unusually Interesting document of Its kind. It has the distinctly Rooseveltian merit of bold nnd vigorous pro-i ncuncement. Mr. Roosevelt Is rarely! a dodger. Whenever undertaking to deal with a subject, he does so in| no hultlng or composition to evade treatmont of any question of nnt-1 lonal concern, however embarrass-' Ing or delicate in hearing it may I prove to be.?Lynchburg News. To sum Up. this message Is note-) worthy for its great length. Its vigorous and easy style. Its candor, its emphatic reiteration of former views as to the Intelligent restraint of aggregated wealth, Its plea for! less technicality In legal procedure,! Its failure to say anything about I tariff revision, nnd Its aggressive defiance of tho State rights doctrine '' In the case of California and her Japanese residents?Norfolk Land? mark. We respectfully submit that the president gets himself In a t.mgr.j and trips himself up In dealing with the necessity of currency elistlcity.

Through the whole message there inns the spirit of Increased central? ization or power in the Federal Gov? ernment, even to school matters In California and divorces and marriage* In all the states. On the latter sub? ject ho reads another homily on race .suicide. Since Hamilton, there hn* been no such Federalist as Roosevelt. He would doubtless chee. fully suggest the surrender of all State's rights to the general Gov? ernment, or rule them by treaties or laws of Congress, leaving only the remnant of police powers upon the throne of the once .sove-v'un commonwealths. ?

His advocacy of greater control of corporations engaged In Interstate commerce as a means of avoiding government ownership, his advocacy of "death duties" Tor the limitation or overgrown fortunes Ills advocacy of an Income tax, or a Federal license to corporations and the use o f the licensing power to squeeze water out of capital stock, as Mr. Bryan expressed it?all these things and others in the message would have been considered radical a few years ago. And now Mr. Roosevelt can advocate these meas? ures without any inconsistency with Iiis position at the head of the con? servative parly of the country.?Tlal timore Sun.
