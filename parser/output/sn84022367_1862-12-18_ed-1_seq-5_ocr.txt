Yesterday morning when daylicht appeared the kfiomy wemed astouished that our army had cro."1! the river. We reti.'rn"J without loaing a single man or a Run. l"ho pickets it the contending armie being pratet only by a few yards, rendered it neowary that everyih.'tig on tmr part ahould be cotiductexl with caution. About nine o'clock yesterday forenoon the miemy advanced their skirmishers along thoir entire line. ftld by noou had . established tlieir pickets near .!: I'ank of the river. Our army has be..' considerably reinforced 8iiie tiit battle. ' It is Ibe opinion of military aien that Men if we luJ succeeded in taking the first rte of the rebel works, the opportunity lor slauiru- ter by the rebek wo'ild fiave been fitr gfeater than previously. ' We had a large number of dead 011 what was regarded ad neutral ground, and as won as it was known that otir forces had evacuated the city, tho soldiers of the enemy commenced robbing thi lifeless bodies. On Monday the pickets of both artiiie front ing the left wing, mutually agreed uwn an ar mistice among themselves, and freely inter mingled with each other, exchanging their dead friendR mil comrades who lav on neu tral ground. During this time a general of our army rode by and put an end to these proceedings. The result was, that both jwirtiea immediately com- meuccd nnng, and nine or our men were killed After the General had left, the friendly demonstrations of our pickets were renewed, and butternut and blue uniforms Ireeiv minded. About this time General Franklin dispatch ed a tlag of truce, which the enemy immedi ately recok'iiizfd, and tlie cxchatico of dead bodies was resumed, and continued until com-ple'ed. lesterdav Genenil Lee sent a nag ot tnn' to General ijurnside, asking him to detail men to bury his dead in front f General Sumner's division. This was dune. The wounded, with the exception of those. whom the em'iny obtained, have all leen brousrht to this side, and are loins' sent to ashuifrton. Our entire armv is uow eneamwd on the same ground which tLv previously occupied Headquarters Army of the Pottomac, December 17. The weather is cold with it north est wind. Last niirht the enemv increased their intrench- ments on the terraces in the rear of Frede ricksbnrg and threw up ritie pits near the riv er, on the left. In the city to-dav their hattalbon drills were visible to the naked eye. On the plain no movements of importance have taken place to-day.
