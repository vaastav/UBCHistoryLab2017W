Cljt S^trbsta&ra Register. J. w. & H. L. SNYDER, Publisher!, SHEPHERDSTOWN, W1?T VIRGINIA. Friday, Decenber 1?, MM. The opponents of Senator Camden have not yet named their candidate for the Senate. Is it because they have none, or because they have too many ? ? ? ? Wk call attention to the advertisement of the Whenling Register in another col umn. Everyone who can should take that paper, for it gives all the State news and is sound in its Democracy. ? ? ? A school has been established in Phil adelphia to teach a new-fashioned walk for young ladies ? said to be a cross be tween the waddle of a dnck and the strut of a turkey gobbler. It's English, you know. ? ? ? Quite a number of Republicans have recently been removed from government offices to make room for Democrats. The administration is beginning to crawl, as it were, in the right direction. We hope soon to see it making vigorous strides. ? ? ? Public opinion against the present extortionate tariff of this country is steadily growing, and the day will soon come when the people will demand a reform in this matter. Mr. Randall and his high-tariff followers are fighting against fate. ? * * The President has been suffering re cently from rheumatism, and numerous old ladies have been sending him cures for the trouble, while an express wagon has been kept busy hauling to the White House the various nostrums of the patent medicine men. ? * ? Pook pater familias will have a hard siege of it now for a few weeks. He will not only have to buy lots of pres ents for his family, hut will have to fur nish the money that they will need to buy others presents with. But Christ mas comes only once a year. * * * Tuesday whs only the second day of the session, but Senator Ingalls found opportunity to offer a bill to increase all sorts of pensions. We shall confi dently look for some of his fellow -dem agogues to offer a bill pensioning every member of the Republican party. ? * ? The last session of the Forty ninth Congress commenced at Washington on Monday, with a full attendance of Sen ators and Representatives. All of the West Virginia delegation were at their post. Xo business of any importance has yet been started, and it is not prob that real work will he begun until alter the Holiday recess. # * * It is stated that Mr. James G. Blaine, Jr., has secured a position as editor of the Pittsburg Times. His father will consequently be sur? of the support of at least one t)aper in the next campaign. It would be a grand scheme, though, if he could only fur nish enough nous to give an editor to each paper in the United States. * # * President Cleveland has been re cently issuing some popular Democratic papefs, and they are making an im pression in his favor. But if he would only go to work in earnest and turn the rascals out ? big and little ? he woul I create such a flood-tide of enthusiasm among the Democrats that he would he placed in the Presidential chair two years hence with a grand rush. ? A KATiiER sensational article was pub lished in a Cincinnati pa|>er last week, accusing Superintendent Peck, of tin* We9t Virginia penitentiary, of blocking brutality to the inmates of the prison. It is evident that tlie facts ? if there are any facts? are greatly exaggerated, and Mr. Peck's friends deny the statements altogether. The fact that the charge* are brought by a discharged assistant is calculated to give them a " fishy" appear ance. An investigation, however, oan do no harm. ? ? ? Tim work of cleaning away the old buildings on the site of the new national library at Washington is progressing but work on the new structure will not begin before next, spring. It is to he hoped that an architect will be allowed to make the plans for the library build ing, for tlie latest government effort ? the new pension office ? was evidently not planned by any intelligent architect.. The building's general appearance is that of a hip-roofed house set on top of an old-fashioned Virginia baru. ? ? ? The Tradesman publishes a compila tion of new industries started in the Southern States during the quarter end ing December 1. They consist of '25 blast furnaces, 65 railroad companies, 131 wood-working establishments, 18 electric light companies, 73 foundries, mills and maehine shops, 59 mining and smelting companies, and 36 tlour mill*. Of these West Virginia gets 1 blast furnace, 1 railway company, 13 wood working establishments, 66 foundries, and 5 mining and smelting companies. ? * ? Wk commend to our farmer frh*nds the reading of President Cleveland'* message to Congress. The principles he advocates are a? sound as a do iar, and his utterances on the tariff and Uxa *ion are especially sensible. In this onnection he say*, "O ir f*rin*n, too, and those engaged directly and indirect ly in supplying the products of agricul ture, see that day by day, and as often as the daily wants of their households recur, they are forced to pay exce>sive and needless taxation, while tluir prod ucts struggle in foreign markets with the competition of nations, which by allowing afreerexchangeof productions than we permit, euable their people to sell for prices which distress the Ainer lean farmer." Ldier <r?? WmHtKOTON. Dkc, 7, 1888. Mtttrs. Editor*.? The opening of Con gress yesterday took place In the pret ence of gre at aggregations of people, not withstanding the un propitious weather. Besides the Speaker, and one or two other*, your district Representative in the House was honored with a desk-top covered with complimentary bouquets.. The attendance of members was unusu ally full for the first day of session. A thinning out of the crowds followed the reading of the President's Message, which contains nothing specially strik ing. He favors tariff modifications; is againot excessive mintage of silver : re news his preference for arbitration in I he labor troubles between masters and men. and sticks with characteristic te nacity to hi# civil service confession of faith. As to District matters he sug gest* the reduction of our District laws to a uniform digested code; the Im provements of our bridges; the exten sion of the police powersof the Commis sioners; the confinement of the rail roads in the city within better restric tions, and the erection of suitable build ings for the accommodation of the several blanches of the District govern ment. The invitations of last year to citizens to express their Ideas on District matters before the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, are this year renewed, and will quite likely be made good u?e of. This opportunity is a val uable one not only to the citizens but to the Senators themselves, who no doubt get many a valuable hint from those who will be sure to feel when and where the shoe pinches. Though of the same nature as the lion's mouth in the city of Venice, it is of a milder type and under safe control. After several months vacation with good pay all the time, Congressmen in both Houses ought nt.w to lay themselves out in good i earnest to give the country a just equiv | Hlent. Sunset Cox is a member of the House in PullUer's place. He wa6 cor dially cheered. The press comments on the Presi dent's Message are generally commend atory. The N. Y. World of to-day I speaks welfof it, but remarks on Mr. ! Cleveland's habit of dissociation with the party of which lie in presumed to be ; the head. Mr. Carlisle, the Speaker, said that lie had not been invited to hear the Message in advance of its delivery, which seeins to be something contrary j to previous practice when the Speaker 1 of the Houte is of the same politics as the Executive, it lias been the custom with Presidents in the past to be with and of the leading lights among those designated by the particular names they respectively wear. A large and destructive fire broke out about half-past 1 o'clock on Sunday morning in Herzog's theatre on D street close to ninth, in the large and showy building also partly occupied by Spen cer's Business College, it was burnt out completely and it took fourteen hours' work of the Fire Department to make an end of the burnnig. Losses on defective insurance and in the stores underneath may amount to $150, U00. No lives were lost but several escapes were very narrow. Mrs. Spencer had to be very nimble to save her life. Two snowstorms have tilled our streets with perhaps six inches of snow, but at present the appearance is fair overhead weather. But compared with the storm swept far \\ est, we are indeed blessed. Public attention is called to the hor rid Voudoo proceedings in Hayti in which murder and cannibalism are so in excess that the interference of civilized people, as the United States and the British government in Jamaica, is loudlv invoked. The worst features ot I African barbarisms on American soils. The publication of the Memoirs of the late Gen. Geo. B. McClellan brings up gome of the most exciting events of the Intersectional War. In respect to Hal leck, McDowell, and Secretary Stan'.on he is the very contrary ot "mealy mouthed." Stanton is his especial dis like. He snys t lint Stanton did all he could to gaiu his confidence in order to get him to take prenistiire and false iii>p< mihI thereby seal his ruin, ihis was before Stanton became Secretary, for afterwards he was a changed man. He nlleges that take East and West to. get her and the losses by disease, more than 600.000 inen were unnecessarily sacrificed for the sake of insuring the success of a political abolition party. He says that Stanton during their earlv acquaintance used to abuse President Lincoln, his administration and the Re publicans. He was in the habit of speaking of Mr. Lincoln as the "origi nal gorilla"' whom ?he African explorer might have easily got in Springfield, Illinois, without the trouble of going to Africa for. Stanton pretended >o be against the Abolitionist* whilst he was secretly furthering their policy in every war. McClellan's memoirs ig a clear per contra to several previous histories of the war. Sergeant Amiss has been appointed to the vacant lieutenancy of the late Richard Arnold, so that there will be no step backward. The Commissioneis adhere to their decision. The news from Europe is that Ger many, as shown in Von Moltke's late speech, will insist on France's disarma ment, or fight. It is thought that Ger many, Austria, Italy and England are united in their European policy. Yours, &c., Jadis. (?really Excited. Not a few of the citizens of Shep herdstown have recently become greatly excited over the astounding facts, that Several of their friends who h*d been pronounced by their physician* as in curable and beyond all hope ? suffering Willi tliut dreaded monster Consump tion ? have been completely cured by Dr. King's New Discovery for Con sumption. the only r?*med3' that do*** ,-ointively cure nil thro.it and lung dis eased.

The Firm Keen Twinge. As the aea*on advances, the peine and aches by which rheumatism makea itself known, are experienced after every exposure. It Is not claimed that Hood's 8arsapHrllla is a specific for rheumatism? we doubt If there Is. or can be. such a remedy.? But the thousands benefited by Hood's Sarsaparllla, warrant as in urging other* who suffer from rheumatism to unite it before the flr?t keen twinge. The Prealdrx'a gin? go. The Pre?ldeot*? message to Congrew it a comprehensive pap*r. dUciiFsing with special e*rne?to*?i and force the leading questions of the'day. inch as the necessity of tariff" reform, the interests of labor as a Sec ted by existing federal taxation, and the suspension of the coin age of sliver. After adverting to our ! peaceful relations with foreign coun- j tries, the Chinese question, the bene- j ficlal change effected bjr the Columbian . government in erectiug Panama into a federal district, the unsettled state of the Canadian fisheries question, the propriety of strengthening our intima cy with Hawaii by renewing the exist ing treaty, our moral right and duty to assist Liberia in conserving its integri ty, the issue of extra territorial jurisdic tion raised by the action of Mexico In the Cutting case, the complaint of the government of the Netherlands in re gard to our special tariff iiupo6t upon Sumatra tobacco, the Samoan Islands protectorate, our commercial relation with the Spanish Antilles, the interna tional copyright question, and the re vision of laws affecting the consular ?er- ; vice, the President proceeds to the tils- . cussion of our several national prob lems. The revenues of the year ended June 30. 1886, shows an increase of $13,- . 740,020.68 over last year, there being an increase of $11,434,084.10 from customs and of $4,407,219.04 from internal reve- ; nue, and a falling off in other receipts of $2,092,274.36. The expense of col lecting both customs and Internal rev enue have been $646,000. The total or- j diuary receipts were $336, 439, 7^7. U6, j and the total ordinary expenditures i $242,484,138 50. The expenses were I $17,788,797 less than the preceding year, ! and the surplus was $93,956,588.56, tin i I increase over the year ended June 30, , ' 1885, of $30,492,817.29. For theeurrent . year the estimated surplus will be ; I ninety millions. The income of the ; j government is declared to be now more i j than ever in excess of public necessl ties. The application of the surplus to | j the extinguishment of the public debt ; would retire all the public indebtedness j which can be now called iu in less than | a year. When this is done, either the j surplus must be withdrawn from circu- ! latiou and hoarded in the treasury or we i inu?t engage iu wasteful public extrav i agance. The worst phase of the existing | system is the perversion of the relations between the people and the govern j ment. When more than is needed to psy the debts of the government and to provide for its economical administra tion is collected, "such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of the ! fundamental principles of free govern j ment." The President says that those J who toil for daily wages are beginning to underitand that capital is sluggish j till it springs into activity touched by ! the hand of labor, and gains the value j which enables it to bear the burden ot federal taxatiou, and they have begun to thoughtfully inquire whether in these circumstances, and considering the tribute they constantly pay into the public treasury, they receive their fair share of advantages. There is also a suspicion abroad, adds the President, that the surplus indicates abnormal bus iness profits, which, under I He system which produces such surplus, increase, without corresponding to the people at large, great fortunes which are j not the natural growth of a steady, plain and industrious republic. I The burden to which the agricultural ! interest, the most important of nil in the country, is subjected by the increased cost of living caused l?y the tariff, while its products have to compete abroiu. wiiii crops raised by less expensive methods, is pointed out. The laborer will gain by every reduction In the cost of living which does not involve a re : duction in the amount of work or rate | of wages. The larger part f our reve j ones will have to be collected from cus toms. Keeping in view all these consid erations, the President recommends iliat the increasing and unnecessary surplus of the national i.icoinc annually accumulating be released to the people by an amendment ;o our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life ami give freerentrance tosucli imported materials as bv Amer ican labor liny be manufactured into marketable commodities. The total coin age of silver dollars since the passage of the Bland bill has been $247,131,349. Ol | iliis amount at the present time the peo pie hold either in colli or silver cerfili cates $166,873,041. The recommenda tion of last year that the coinage be suspended is renewed upon all the grounds there set forth, rcinforced by the significant increase in our gold exportations. li. treating of army ami 1 navy affairs the President reiterates the absolute necessity of better harbor d?> lenses, and the hope is expressed that effective steps will be taken in that direc tion immediately. It is also suggested that the army and navy contracts might he so united as to give encouragement to domestic manufacturers to enter the business of producing gun steel and armor plates. The reports of the Post office Department show that the present rates of postage will ultimately euttice to sustain the service, although our peo ? pie enjoy now both cheaper postage, proportionately to distance, and a vaster and more costly service than any other nation on the globe. The Preeident suggests that, as distinguished from a grant or a subsidy, whatever outlay may be required to secure additional postal service, requisite and proper and not otlierwiseattainable, with the Argentine Republic and the empire of Brazil should be regarded as within the legiti mate compensation for such service. The extension of the free-delivery sys km is recommended. The erection oi one or more national penitentiaries for the confinement of persons convicted by tlie federal courts is urged, and it is suggested that by employing the con victs in government work they could be m tde self-supporting and at the same time not be brought into undesirable competition with frea labor. The rec- j ommendations made last year for an ; alteration in the organization of federal courts is renewed, as is the suggestion j that a change be made in tb? manner of compensating attorneys and marshals. Considerable space in the message is davoted to a discussion of the Indinn question and the presentation of addi tional argument* in favor of the com mission suggested in the last nft*ssage, ; which should be able to put in opera- j lion differeut methods of Indian mail- j agement adapted to the different phases of development in which the different tribn* are, wlili the ultimate object of allotting to them all lands in severalty and bringing th*m into the onis of our citizens. The energetic efforts of the land department under the present ad ministration have succeeded in restor ing to the public domain two million seven hundred and fifty thousand acres of land wrongfully Appropriated, and almost as much more is now in litiga tion. The aggregation of public lands in large holding* by persons, many of whom are foreigners, iaeonimented upon as a serious evil. It is reeom?aeu?led that the pre-emption and timber culture acts be repealed, and 'hat the homestead law be so amended as to make the re quirements of residence and cultivation much more strict. Ilestrietions ijpon the alienation of homestead rights until after patents have been issued are also suggested. Much has been done to se cure the removal of unlawful fences from the public domain, but much still remains to be done. The report of the commissioner of pensions shows a net increase of more than 20,000 pensioners during the year,* and the President points out the injus tice done by indiscriminate pension leg islation. The plan suggested by the Secretary of the Interior and approved bv the government directors in the Pa cific railroads for a change in the method of paying the indebtedness of those roads to the government Is referred to with the comment that the "only mat ters" to be considered are the situation of the government as a creditor and the surest way to secure the payment of the principal and interest of its dobt. Federal legislation upon the subject of railroad rates for interstate commerce is suggested in t lie liglit of t lie recent decision of the Supreme Court as a sub ject worthy of consideration. Upon the question of the relations of labor and capital the recommendations in the special message of last year that the labor bureau be given powers to arbitrate in cases between employers and employees voluntarily referred to it are renewed, and it is declared that after law has dor.e all that it can "much more remains to be accomplished in the reinstatement and cultivation of a true American sentiment which roaognizes the equality of American citizenship." The work of ',he department of agricul ture is favorably commented upon and the extension of its function suggested. The application by Congress of swell legislation as the constitutions! limits will permit to the extinction of the | pleuro-pneumonia among the cattle of I several States is recommended. It is stated that the continued opera: tion of the law relating to the civil ser vice has added the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness, ami the cheerful and ungrudging sup port of Congress is invoked for the re form. An increase in the salaries of | the civil-service commissioners is rec ' oin mended. The plain duty of paying the unpaid claims of the depositors in the Freed men's Savings and Trust Company is called to the attention of Congress, and the message closes with certain recom mendations relating to the local affairs of the District of Columbia.?
