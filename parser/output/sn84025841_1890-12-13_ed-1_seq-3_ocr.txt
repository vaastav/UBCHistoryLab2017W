P I Washinoton, D. C., Dae. 8, '90. I From our Regular Correspondent. I Th*-? President is devoting a con? siderable portion of his time to & < areful an?l comprehensive conaidera tion of our present financial system, which he, in common with many ??ther profound thinkers, believes tnt* cuuutry has outgrown. That something is needed he has long agu .mo convinced, but just what mat sc. met tiing la and the best way to obtain it is \\ bat has not been de? cided. It wns l**ecnuse no decision had been ur rived at that neither the President's message nor Secretary Wiudom's annual report contained any specific recommendation on this subject. Whether the President will later send a special financial mes? sage to Congress or will, with aid of a Senator and a Representative, em? body the result of his thinking in a \n he simultaneously introduced in tb* House and Senate is as yet Rroblematical. But something must e done soon, for the clamor for ra money becomes louder and louder every day, and the believers in a free and unlimited courage of silver, who constitute a majority in Congress, are growing more and more restless. The adoption of a resolution con? demning the Federal Election bill by the Farmers' Alliance convention, at Ocala, might have disconcerted the -republicans somewhat if it had not been followed by the positive infor? mation that the whole business was put up in this city at a conference of Southern democratic Senators. As it was, it attracted no more atten? tion than would the same resolution passed by any other democratic con? vention. CongTe-aS hrs lost no time to speak of in its first week. The House luis passed the International copyright bill, the regular annual pension ap? propriation bills, and several others of minor importance, while tho Sou ate is working Hway at the Federal election bill in a wav which indicates that 1H91 will still be very young: when that measure, slightly modifi? ed, shall have become a law of the land. Senator Stanford has introduced his bill to loan Government money to farmers at low rates of interest upon mortajragps upon their real es? tate. He asked that the bill be al? lowed to lie upon the table until he shall have submitted a few remarks upon it. The Senate Finance com mittee made an unfavorable report upon this bill at the last session, but Mr. Stanford insists that the more thought he devotes to the subject the more he becomes convinced that it is a sound constitutional and practical method of supplying the national need for a sound circulat? ing medium. ? tfmmge has yet boon made in the S-'m!ti*r*!sr ' . tbe Fv.vral election bili, aud none will be made until the democrats be? gin to resort to flllibustoring. The republicans have nt) desire to pre? vent their opponents exercising every legitimate right in discussing this measure, but they propose to allow no extended fillibustering. There ia au interestitTg rumor float - ing around the Capitol to the effect that the democratic Senators hui decided not to flllibuster against a final vote. This may be taken with a Brain of allowa ure, in fact several of them. Secretary Noble has been looking pretty closely into the business of the pension office of late, and one of tlie results is that a bill prepared at hia request has beeu introduced in the House by Representative Bel knap, of Michigan, reducing tie fee of pension attornies for obtaining increases of pensions from $10 to $1. This has raised a howl among the pensiou attornies, whose fees for the month of Noveml>er for innv pension ca^es alone amouuted to $80,000. Secretary Noble says there is no need for an applicant for an increase in pension to employ an attorney and that it is little short of robbery for an attorney to exact a fee of $10?for the nominal service performed in such cases. Mr. Noble is understood to be considering oth? er changes in the methods of doing business with the pension office that will be beneficial to the country and to the deserving pensioners. The country has long ago become convinced that Mr. Blaine is one of the ablest, if not the ablest Secreta? ry of the State we have ever had, and the correspondence in the Bar rundia affair, which resulted in the recall of minister Mumer, just sub? mitted to Congress, adda another proof to the st: ready ex? isting of Mp. Ll'.*!*.,,-/* aptitude in deaiiug with complicated interna? tional questions. Democratic Con gressmen vies with republicans in complimenting Mr. Blaine for his management of this matter. Ex Governor Pacheco, of California, has been nominated Minister to the Central America States to succeed Mr. Mizner. The House Census committee has practically agree upon an appor? tionment bill making the member? ship of the House 350, an increase of 24. Senator Pasoe on Saturday prc sented to the Senate the protest of the convention of the Conger larc bill. It is a bill as a substitute foi the lard bill.
