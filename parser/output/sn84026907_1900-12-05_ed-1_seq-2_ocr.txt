The Lexington Dispatch Burned April 25th; rebuilt July 19. 1894. G. M. HARjfAN. Editor and Publi*b*r. - o r* LEAimxlU-d, o. o., WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1900. Mr. M. H. Witt, one of the priu<i pie agitators of the movement fo annex a portion of Cjogaree towrBhip to Richland county was ia town Monday in the interest of his schemeHe visited the Auditor's ifiiee to a;certain the amount of the toxab'e prope-ty in the area proposed tcriltory to be cot, and also to fiud out the number of inhabitants therein residing. We are informed that the territory he is after lies within the following lines: Beginning at the mouth of Double branches on ibe Saluda rive); thenc* the said branch to be the line as far as Double Branch church; thence in a straight line to the Dortbeast cor ~A?b r?/-j TV fi qd QtT U1 lilt) llBUt Ui iauu nuu"M o> the Green H:ll tree'; tbence in b straight line to the southwest corner of the said G.een Hill tract; Ibence to a corner on the Arthur place; tbence in a straight line to the Con garee river just btlow the government lock?; thence to the point of beginning, CoDgaree and Saluda rivers being the line. He cannot take any' ten itory on this aide of the Double branches by reason of the Constitu ionai prohibition, being less than eight miles from the court house in this place, and if the western limit of the town is the starting point within the meaning of the Constitution, it is doubtful if the Double branches and cous'deruble territory beyond can be inc'uded in the lines. From the jtil comer in this place to the new city hall in Columbia is exactly twelve miles?the twelve mile post having stood at the Main 6treet entrance to the State House grounds. Bui Brookland has uot be?n annexed yet and there is ''many a slip betwixt the cup and lip " The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Kentucky Jim Crow Car law in an opinion handed down in the case of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad versus the State of Kentucky, Jurtiee Harlan filed a d'ssenting opiD ion. Another car load of insane United States soldiers from the Philippine islands passed through El Paso, Texas, on December 3rd on their way to Washington. The prevalence of insanity among the soldiers is attributed to an intoxicant brewed by the natives and to exposure. The short session of Congress convened in tbe city of Washington last Monday. The message of President McKinley was read in both houses. It is an able paper and the President deals with measures o' public interest iu a clear and concise manner. The report of Ibe istbumin canal commission j-jst submitted, ssys that, "the most practicable and feasible route for an iitbmain canal, under the control, management and ownership of the United States, ie that knowu a? the Nicaragua route " The coet of digging tb6 ditch is estimated at $156,378,238.

Thie program was rendered iu the eoort house on Thanksgiving Day before a number of the patrons and fiienda of the Institute. Similar exercises were usuaMy held in the Institute builJing, but the attend aDce has increased so much in thr last year or so that it is now almost too email to accommodate the pupils much less visitors. It would be ustli'ss to attempt anything like a description of bow each pupil arquitted himself, Lut it is suficieut to say they all did well Mrs. E B. R >tf, who was la:^ t year e'ected instructor of mus e foi ti:e msututf, assisieu id iraioiog the pupil* in the song*. Mr*.

Prof. E J D:eher, a vrtei d Before purchasin, . aix- _ , teacher, wa? iatrodaced aDd spoke j intelligently, interestingly and some i times humorously for more than half an hour. This address was replete with good advice which was *a kr\ I vrrn iccidcu uj an picmiiii. ah to iu be hoped that bis timely remarks will be heeded by many. This was a blight cherry, pleasant day for the little folks as well as fbe grown up ones The smaller ones were taught lessons of loyalty to government, obedience to parents and reverence to G .>d. The older ones had these lessons, which tbey learned in childhood, impressed more thoroughly upou thier miuds. It is a good thing for parents to come out and see what his sou aod daughter is doing. I', is a means of encouraging both child and parent. Spring Hill Sparks. To the Editor of the Dispatch: The bealih of our community is very good at this writing. Ojr people are still rowing rnoie and more wheat and oats. Mr. E1 L Eleazer is iu Columbia now working for W. S Pope k Co.

Jacobs made a business tiip to Lexington last week. Wishing much success to the Dispatch and its reader*, I am yours truly, J ybn DjoIJ. Pity and Beauty The most beautiful thing in the world is the baby, ail dimples and iov. The most pitiful thing is that same baby, thin and in pain. And the mother does not know that a little fat makes all the difference. Dimples and joy have gone, and left hollows and i'car; the fat, that was comfort and color and curvc-all but pity and love-is gone. The little one gets no fat from her food. There is something wrong; it is either her food or food-mill. She has had no fat for weeks; is living on what she had stored in that plump little body of hers; and that is gone. She is starving for fat; it is death, be quick! Scott's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil is the fat she can take; it will save her. - The genuine his this picture on it, take so other. |flP| If vou have not tried it. send JSMEgS for free sample, its agreeable flBH> taste will surprise von.
