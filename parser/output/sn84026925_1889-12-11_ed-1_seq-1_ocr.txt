It was a cruel blow, aud it took all his manhood to rise up under it. His associates at the office of The Dawn showed the best side of their natures. They were kind and considerate all through this trying time. Although the story of the fraudulent mining company and the suicide and its attending incidents were the sensation of the hour, they printed as little of it as possible, and kept Rush's name out altogether. He had no sooner returned to Now York and settled down to work again than Archie Tillinghast called upon him and by his gentle and manly sympathy sealed their friendship with a seal that nothing could ever break. He also brought kind words from Bessie Archer and her mother and an invitation from Mr. Archer to spend the following Sunday with them. Rush was sincerely touched by these expressions of sympathy, for he almost felt himself ostracized by the disgrace that had befallen him; and the finding of Uncle Lightfoot Myers' card at his lodgings one day did more towards convincing him that there was something worth living for, after all, than anything that had happened since his disgrace, for it showed a kindliness of spirit on the part of a mere acquaintance that he had-no reason to expect. A short letter from Aunt Rebecca, who of course had heard nothing of the tragedy that had cast so deep a shadow over the life of her young friend, announced that she and Helen would sail from Liverpool on the 1st of September, so that they were nearly due In New York at the time Rush received the letter. With what conflicting emotions he read this announcement! A few weeks ago it would have thrown him intd an ecstasy of delight; now he buried his face in his hands, and his thoughts were not pleasant thoughts. Would Helen look upon John's conduct as disgracing his brother? Would she think there was crime in the blood of the family, and turn her back upon him? . "I could not blame her," said Rush to himself, "for it would reflect upon her to be seen in the company of the brother of John Hurlstone, the swindler and suicide." And his strong frame quivered withagony. ? There was no relief from his thoughts but work At his desk in The Dawn office Rush could forget the frightful past, and he thanked God for work that must be done. The 11th of September came, and he knew that the Germanic was to arrive that day. He would not go down to meet it, but would wait for Helen to take some steps that would end his sus?Whot !f noimf Vianrd frnm pcuoo. " UUW U HV "V.V. -vW w ? ? her? He almost believed that he would take his life, as his brother had dons. Archie Tillinghast, who divined what was going on in Rush's mind, went down to the steamer and met Helen and told her what had happened. His heart was with his friend in his trouble, and his recital filled Helen with sorrow. Her beautiful brown eyes swam with tears. Ah, if Rush might have seen them! "Poor boy! poor boyP said die; "I long to see him, to tell him how deeply I sympathize with him." . "Have him round at once, Helen.

She is simply superb. Her trip has done her a world of good. Stick to it, old man; she is too great a prize to lose. I believe I am half in love with her myself." "I know you mean well, Archie, but your tone does not lB|?monize with my mood. Ofcfcan't feel very gay when I know that my chances with Helen Knowlton are slimmer today than they ever were and that any balance there may have been on my side of the ledger is now against me. The prospect is not pleasing, and I wish I were dead." "Nonsense, Rush! I'm ashamed of you. You aro not talking like a man. I begin to think you don't deserve so fine a woman. Why should you fly to the conclusion that she will turn her back upon you because you are in trouble? You have no right to do her so great an injustice, and I believe she would be hurt to the quick if she knew you thought 60 poorly of her." "You forget, Archie," answered Rush, sadly, "that I am not an accepted lover of Helen Knowlton. If I was, I should expect her to stand by me through thick and thin. I am only a friend, a new friend at that, and I have my place in her regard still to win. Whether I am successful or not depends upon myself. If I can prove myself to be everything I should like to have her believe me, well and good; but I have got to fight my way inch by inch, and for many reasons my claims are not strong enough to give me an instant hearing. My success is a of timA and fortunate circum II stances." I "i suppose what you say Is bo," said I Ax-chie, pacing the room excitedly, "but, > by heaven, it is a strange law of nature!

I "After all, how are they to know?" [ asked Rush. "Every man thinks he is the right one. Look at the men who have loved Helen, for instance. I won't say 3he has given them any encouragement, but they have loved her just as truly all the same. I heard only the other day ot a man who loved her with an honest, sincere love. He was a lieutenant in the army. He only met her once, and then as only one of a dozen who were presented to her, but lie saw her many times on the stage of the Academy. He believed there was no hope for him. He was stationed at Governor's Island, but he asked to be sent out on the frontier, sc that ho nought run a chance of being 5Y SIEGE. ig Journalist's ExperiMew York. ay, Philadelphia, Pa., and Published by the American Press Association. killed. He was transferred as he requested, and, whenever there was a skirmish with the Indians, put himself in the front of the fight One day he was rewarded; a bullet hit him in a vital part and he died on the field. A friend of mine, an officer in the same regiment found him dying, and asked him if he had any message he wanted delivered. Yes,' said the dying man; 'cut a lock of hair from my head and take it to Helen Knowlton, and toll -r that I loved her;' and with these words upon his lips he died. My friend took his penknife and cut off the lock of hair and delivered it as requested. Helen was very much afI fee ted by the incident - mmeiiiber me man at an. now, wuw shall say this poor fellow was not the right man, if only he and she had known it? Certainly he loved her with an honest love." "True indeed," answered Archie, still pacing the floor?"true indeed. The whole subject seems to be involved in mystery. I don't know, after all, if another war maxim is not to be applied to affairs of tho heart: 'To the victor belong the spoils.' But while we are dealing in glittering generalities I am forgetting the object of my calL Here is a little note Helen scratched off for you on the dock." And Archie handed the card to Rush, who took it eagerly. "Did she know?did she know everything when Bhe wrote this, Archie?" "Yes, old man?everything." "I will go, then?God bless her!" It seemed an age to Rush before it was time to go to Helen's house, and, although he was impatient for the hour to come, hia heart beat high with excitement and his cheeks were pale with nervous dread when he rang the front door bell of the little house in West Twentieth street How strangely familiar the drawing room looked! Everything was as it naa been the night before she sailed. A faithful servant had kept the place open and in order while she was gone, and it seemed as fresh and bright when she got back as though she had never been away. Rush noticed the delicate odor of violets that hung about everything that belonged to Helen, and it brought her as vividly before his eyes as if she stood there in all her loveliness. He had not long to wait before she did stand before him in her bodily presence. She came towards him with both hands extended. "You must excuse my neglige, Mr. Hurlstone, but I didn't want to keep you waiting, and?I wanted to see you. Aunt Rebecca will be down in a few moments, but she is so busy with trunks that she can't come at once. Sit right down here on this sofa and tell me how you are and how you've been." "I needn't ask you how you are," said Rush, at last finding voice to speak. Seating himself beside her,3i&?t?garded her with undisguised adn^f^tion. He might well think her lovejjjf ^fess prejudiced eyes would have agreed with him thoroughly. She had been helping Aunt Rebecca with the trunks, and had donned - femsawraE afi gs&aftgp neck and sleeves with dark fur. The red upturned point of a gold embroidered Turkish slipper peeped out from beneath her gown and gave the only bit of color to her costume. Her brown hair was done up in a careless classic knot on the too of her head, and she looked as though she had just stepped out of a frame and it would take very little to make her step back again. Nothing could be kinder than her manner to Rush. Her object seemed to be to make him fprget himself and his troubles, and she talked about everything of interest she had seen. Rush followed Jrt:r vaguely; for he could not shake orf the load upon his heart. The mor? she talked and the more beautiful she looked, the worse he felt. Among other things, 6he asked him if he liaa < seen anything of Uncle Lightfoot Myers while she was away. He replied that he had not seen him, but that Mr. Myers had left his card at his lodgings. "I wonder if he is in town now. When was it that he left his card?" Rush ran over in his mind all that awful time. He remembered his feelings when he found the old gentleman's card, and the recollection was more than he could bear. "It was only a few days ago," he managed to say. "I had just got back from home." And, with this memory fresh in his mind, he buried his face in his hands. His frame 6hook with suppressed sobs and the hot tears forced their way through his fingers. If you are inclined to call this an unmanly exhibition, you must remember that his nerves were strung up to a high pitch, that ho had gone through a great deal during the past few days, and was not master of himself. Helen regarded him with feelings of the most profound pity. "Poor boyl" 6he said, softly. And taking his hot head between her cool, soft palms, she kissed him gently on the forehead. CHAPTER XXIL ^^ERHAPS v ou mav 1 mumt'U until ? ui uau ^aou ' The opera season would not begin unj til the middle of October, but Helen conI eluded to stay in New York to look after ! some costumes and rehearse some new roles. Hush began to think that fate was kind to him at last, for nothing could have been more delightful than his afternoons at Helen's. Though neither Hush nor Helen were sentimental, as the term is usually interpreted, they were both very fond of poetry. Rush had read ; more than 6he had, and it was his delight | to lead Helen through this path of literature. She was devoted to Mrs. Brown>' ing's sonnets from the Portuguese. Rush had gone through that phase, and led her on to the sonnets of Shakespeare and of Dante. The latter they read in the original, Helen reading an? Rush asking questions when he did not quite understand the Italian. It really was an ideal time, and Rush, being uncertain of the future, wished that it might last indefi- i nitely. But of course this wasn't to be expected. It was soon over, and poetry < gave way to contracts, Mr. Maxmann's visits growing mere frequent as Rush's I grew more rare. I However, Rush found himself at Hel- i en*8 house as often as he could hope to 1 be there. It really seemed as though he 1 was necessary to her. His attentions i were constant, but not annoying, and i she 60on began to realize that he was in I love with her. At first she didn't like i the idea at all, because she thought it i would break a pleasant friendship. Any- I thing beyond that seemed to her out of : the question. He was ehtirely too young, though he was a dear, good fellow and * J u: TT7U~? Biiu watt very iuiiu ui iuul vv nen but? saw that he had apparently no intention of declaring himself, and that their relations remained just -ea^they -had been aU n* I,- nerserr aown to the old way, and almost made up her mind that , a touch of such a feeling as Hush's added a piquancy to friendship. Things went on this way all winter; but one day in the early spring Rush walked in upon her with a telegram in his hand. He looked excited, but not particularly happy. "Here is a dispatch from my chief," 1 said he, "ordering me to London to re- 1 organize The Dawn bureau over there. < It is a big thing, as far as business goes, but I can't say that I feel like leaving < New York. I shall be guided by your i advice. What shall it be?"' ] Helen hesitated a few moments and 1 then said: "If you wish me to tell you what I be- ' lievo would be for your best interest, I 1 should say at once, 'Obey the order.' If i I went by my own feelings I should say, 1 'Stay at home,' for I shall miss you very 1 much." 6 "Then I shall go, both because your i judgment in the matter is sound and because I shall be so flattered to have you miss me. Our chief orders by cable and he expects his orders to be obeyed almost in the same manner. I shall have to sail to-morrow." "To-morrow!" "So the order says. Well, I suppose I had better let the folks at home know it and make such arrangements as are necessary and be off. I shall be around in the morning to say good-by, but this evening I shall have to devote to the office. There will be a thousand and one things to attend to. If there is anything I can do for you on the other Bide, command ma To be executing your orders, though three thousand miles away, will afford me the greatest delight." And so Rush talked on for half an hour, unable to tear himself away, though well aware that it was high time for him to be off. The next morning he was at the house again. Helen was taking her late breakfast when he came in, dressed in her prettiest morning gown, and looking like a bit out of Watteau as she sipped her tea from a Sevres cup and patted the head of her pet greyhound. Helen was not one of those young women who think it vulgar to eat. She had a healthy appe- tite, and was fond of good eating; but she ate very daintily, and had a way of fixing her food before 6ho began eating that made it particularly attractive. The presence of Rush did not in the least interfere with her appetite. She was very how fnnn nrjd she brewed ?' usually call -English Wfast bul, WJ Rush called nectar.

He had been very gay, nervously f so, up to this point; but now his courage | failed him, and Helen, too, showed signs r low spirits. She told him she was going to miss him; but she had no idea how c much she would miss him when she t spoke. t "I must give you something to remem- ^ ber me by, for if I do not you will forget f me over there among those pretty Eng- ? lish girls." And she looked about her for i something appropriate. "Ah. here is e just the thing," she said, going to her 8 writing desk. "Watch seals are coming c into fashion again; here is a curious old ~ one that belonged to my grandfather; he [ sealed all his love letters to my grand- { mother with it 1 don't know whether g I ought to give you an heirloom, but | then 1 feel as if you were one of the fam- ^ ily?a younger brother, or cousin, or f something of that 6ort See, isn't it odd?" j And she handed the seal to Rush. ] Ho ovnminoH tho riirlntm *L"nrlrtiinn. Qjfj JBJ which Helen Mr/ touched Iiu s h ' s brow made him kSSSgS&JJ contrary, it made ? imt ver7 un^aP" py; for he knew that if she had loved him as he loved her she would no more have kissed him than she would have put her hand in the fire and burned it off. It was a kiss of friendship?a sisterly kiss?any 6ort of kiss except the kiss of love; and Rush Hurlstone's heart sank into his boots. He felt more hopeless at that moment than at any other time during his courtship. His interview with Helen, however, did him good. It nt least assured him of her friendship; and friendship, by careful cultivation, mignt oecnangea into something warmer. West Hastings had not returned from Europe yet, and Rush had the field al' most to himself, for it was early in the season, and the men whom Helen knew were mostly out of town. He himself was at her house every day?not exactly 1 as a caller, but more as a brother. It i was to bring her a book, to show her ? something in the papers she might not have Been, to try over a piece of music with her; there was always some good excuse. Helen was more than glad to have him, partly because she liked attention, and partly l>ecause she liked a bright man with whom she could be on sisterly terms. Rush's hours at The I Dawn office were such that his time was his own from noon, when he got up, until 9 o'clock in the evening, when 1 he was due at his desk, where he re. I 1?J ill n ...? ship, and then turned the seal to the ] light. It was not only old fashioned, it was pretty. The stone was sardonyx, [ and the Intaglio represented a dove fly- < ing with a letter tied around its neck, j Underneath was the legend, in French, , "From thy true lover." Rush blushed to ] the roots of his hair as lie read it, but ( Helen, who had forgotten what the inscription was until she saw him blush, t pretended not to notice. Taking the seal , carelessly from his hand, she fnstened it , on his watch chain. , "There." she said, "let that be your j talisman.

( "You couldn't have given me any- ( thing that would please iue more." said ] Rush, recovering from his embarrassment "For you to care to give me any ( parting gift is of itself flattery enough; ( but to give me a thing about which there is such a pretty family sentiment Is be- ! yond anything I had a right to expect. j You may be sure that I will never part ? from this talisman.

"Indeed no," she answered him ban- , teringly. "What a scrape I would find . myself in with my French maid! Be- , fore two letters were sent you would ( find paragraphs in the newspapers about it. No, indeed, my friend; no practical jokes at ray expense." I Rush felt that his time had not come < yet, so there was nothing left for him to do but to leave a good-by message for Aunt Rebecca, who was at the Academy ( of Music, harassing Maxmann, say goodby to Helen and take himself off. "Well," said he. rising, "the best of friends must part. I little thought when , I bade you bon voyage last spring that ( in a few months I should hear the same words from your lips. I shall be aw- ' fully homesick, there's no doubt of that; but if you will occasionally drop me a i line, if it's only a business letter, I shall bo supremely happy." ( "You know .* am a poor correspondent," answered Helen; "but you can rolieve your homesickness by writing to me. I love to get letters, particularly such interesting ones as you will be sure to write; only don't seal them with that seal." And she laughed a merry lauglL "You must tell me everything about your business, for 1 am very much in cerestea in your success, sue auueu, taking his hand. "Whatever success I have had, or am to have. Miss Knowlton, is duo to your encouragement. The kind words I have had from you, and the desiro I have to make make myself worthy of your kindness, are an incentive that few young men have when they begin the work of their lives," said Rush, with a touch of sentiment in his voice. "It's very amiable of you to say so, and I should be very pleased to kno'"* that any word of mine had been of help or encouragement to you; but i think you over estimate the encouragement you have received from me. Not that I am not deeply interested in you; both Auut Rebecca and I liked you the very first day wo saw you. You aroti partio uJar favorite of my aunt's. I won't say what I think of you," 6he added, with a smile; "it might make you vain." So they said good-by, and in a short time Rush was on board the steamer bound for Liverpool. Archie Tillinghast came down to see him off, and brought a pleasant message from the Archers? Bessie and alL They congratulated him on his foreign appointment, and hoped that it was but the stepping stone to better things at home. And so Rush sailed from New York. He was a good Bailor, and enjoyed every hour of the voyage, rhere were not many people going over, but those who were proved to be agreeable traveling companions.

Rush learned afterwards that tiis chiefs good humor and accessibility m this occasion were a lucky accident, it another time he might have been unapproachable, but on this particular ifternoon something had happened to put him in a good humor and Rush got ;he benefit of it. John Gaspar Plummett was a peculiar nan He was the son of a verv able father, and had inherited a fortune and a lewspaper. As a young man he had been rery wild, and at forty he was not tamed :o any great extent. His exuberance of ipirits showed itself in the conduct of his japer. He got up the wildest schemes md generally carried them out with success, thus making The Dawn the best mown newspaper in America and the jest known American newspaper in Europe. Plummett, without being handlome, was very distinguished looking. 3e had a tall, aristocratic figure and bore liraself with a great deal of dignity. It ivould bo impossible for a stranger to jass him in the street without turning iround and saying to his companion, if le happened to have one, "Who is that listinguished looking man?" He was ?ery particular about his dress, and had i style of his own that his friends tried & imitate; but, as few had such a figure, he imitation was not suocessful. Peojle who knew Plummett slightly fancied hat his wild schemes were without uethod, and that he was a haruin-scarmi sort of fellow, who did everything lit or miss, and whose business was at oose ends. On the contrary, he always mew what lie was about, and he had a rtwnr tiAn/1 hnoinnea \Jl A? IICUU lUi UUOIUCOO. Although he was seldom In New York, le watched his pr.percarefully and knew vho wrote e*"jry article in it. He had >een looking closely after Rush ever ;ince he came upon the paper, and was rery much pleased with his work. When le found that his London office was not nanaged as he thought it should be, he it once made up his mind that Rush vas the man to reorganize it. And he eroved to be right. In a general way he old Rush what he would like to see lone, but he did not give very minute instructions, as he wanted to see what he young man would do if left to himt?wu vimi go vi vnc lUtCl^Zi lepartment in New York, Rush knew its hortcomingsand had a plan mapped out or its improvement.

Eis brightness ind sincerity of purpose made him a jreat many friends among the public nea of England, and he succeeded in jetting some important interviews out of hem. In the matter of foreign news he cept The Dawn hours ahead of any other ^ew York paper, and everybody interested in newspaper work said that Rush Eurlstone was a journalist of mark. For two years Rush stayed in London. [Vo busy years they were. In all this ;tme he had not seen Helen, but he bad leard from her occasionally. She did lot hesitate to tell him that Bhe missed lim, but 6he did not tell him how much ihe wished that he was back In New Jfork. If Rush had planned his absence is a ruse he could not have planned a iiore successful one. The man who Inrented the proverb, "Out of sight, out of aiind" didn't know what he was talking lbout. "Out of sight, never out of nind" would be nearer the truth. Helen lad never thought so much of Rush as luring his absence. I can't say that he thought more of her, for I do not see fiow that would have been possible. Helen*8 life was a busy one, too; but still she missed Rush almost as much as though 6he had been an idle woman. He was not a man to be taken out of a young woman's life and not be missed. Rush heard occasionally from Archie nilinghast, who sometimes spoke of Helen, but more frequently of Bessie Archer. Bessie was getting to be more like her Did self, and Archie began to hope, as ihe now had no crackbrained agitators Dn her visiting list. She had tried wood carving and amateur photography as a pastime, and now Bhe was amusing herself by trying to hatch chickens with a patent incubator. Rush was very glad to hear this, for ho had feared that Bes 3ie, in her craving for something that society could not give her, might fall again Into dangerous company. lie did not know her. The lesson she had learned lasted her a lifetime. At the end of Rush's two years in London Mr. Plummett sent for hira to come over to Paris, where he was living in great style. Rush crossed the channel, and hurried on to Paris to learn a piece of important news. The managing editor of The Dawn was getting too old to do his work satisfactorily, so Mr. Plummett concluded to retire him on a pension and offer Rush the vacant chair, with a salary of ten thousand dollars. This the young editor was only too well pleased to accept. Armed with his chief's orders, ho returned to New York by the first steamer. None of his friends knew of his coming. He hadn't time to write, and he thought it hardly worth while to cable, me trip noma was as uneventful as the trip over had been, but Rush's sensations were immeasurably different. Before ho had been sailing away from Helen, now ho was sailing to her; and when tiio vessel reached quarantine he mado a rough calculation to see if he would not gain timo by swimming ashore. He concluded, however, that he would bo taken for a thief or a lunatic if he gavo way to any such impulse, and so remained quietly on board until the vessel arrived at her dock. Again he had to restrain himself, for he wanted to drive direct to Helen's house from the steamer. Instead, he drove to the Brevoort, which was his headquarters for some timo to come. New York had never looked 60 attractive to him as it did on this October morning. He saw plainly enough where it fell short of London's grandeur; but there was a homelike look about the place that waa very grateful to a mj^n who had been. away tor two years. Even the strangers in the streets looked like old friends. Rush had learned from a daily paper, brought on board the steamer by the pilot, that the opera season would not begin for a fortnight, so he knew that Helen's time would be comparatively unemployed. He also saw by the same paper that "our distinguished prima donna, Miss Helen Knowlton," had arrived ,in town from Saratoga, and was occupying "her charming little house in West Twentieth street.n He first sent a telegram to his mother, telling her that he had arrived, and then he set about unpacking his trunks and preparing to call upon Helen. He divested himself of his traveling clothes, and after a refreshing bath, arrayed himself in the lat<r>t style of -English afternoon dress, and sallied forth. Before he started out he looked at himself in the long mirror in his room and congratulated himself that he appeared at least ten years older than when he left. The reason for this was largely attributable to the imposing Vandyke beard and mustache ho had grown during his absence, which n*' . but were exceedingly becoming. ?Arrived in sight of ,Helen's house, Rush felt his heart beating like a trip hammer; but it almost stood still when he got to within twenty feet of the door, for there, slowly coming down the front stepB, was the hated West Hastings. Hakings was so much occupied with bis own thoughts that he did not see Rush. The expression on his face was one of undisguised surprise. He looked as though it were impossible for him to believe what had happened; but whether bo could not realize his good fortune or his bad, Rush was unable to decide. He mode up bis mind, however, that ho would know before he left Hden's house, and end the suspense he had been living in for the past five years. He had had no such thought when he left the hotel, but the sight of West Hastings aroused all the jealousy in his nature and made him fully alive to the fact that he was occupying a very uncertain position. His mind was now fixed, and he rang tie door bell with such a determined. pall mat tne little bell tinkled for several minutes, and the old man servant who had been so long attached to Helen's service forgot his dignity for once and came running to the door. He was as much pleased as surprised to see Rush, and ushered him unannounced into the drawing room, where Helen was standing, apparently lost in thought, before the wood fire that crackled on the hearth. Irdeed, she was so absorbed that she did rot hear Rush enter the room, and he had the pleasure of gazing upon her In all her lovely ununconsciousness. A long sigh escaped from her lips, and, as she raised her eyes, she saw Rush advancing towards her. A look of terror passed over her face, and she gave a low cry of alaim. "I hope I have not frightened you," said Rush, taking her hard; "but I was so lost in admiration that I did not dare to speak and break the ctarm."

But how you have changed I You look older by years than you did when you went away."

It is the first sign that old age is creeping or. But tell me what this means?why are you home?

"My departure from the other side vas sudden; I didn't know until forty eight hours before I sailed that I was to come. Tho chief sent for me to meet him in Paris. There ho told me he wanted me to become managing editor of The Dawn at once; so I hurried back to Hew York by the first steamer. "Managing editor of Tho Dawn! You take your honors coolly. That is as fine a position as a journalist could have. I congratulate you; but I am not surprised. From the way I heard people 8p<jak of your work in London, I was prepared for anything." "People were very kind to speak well of my work If they had only known my incentive, however, they would have wondered why I didn't do better. But enough about me; tell me about yourseu; that is a much more interesting subject. You looked sad as I entered, and you breathed a deep sigh. Has anything gone wrong? I wish you would make me your confidant; you must know that I would not only share any of your troubles, but take the burden of them upon my own shoulders most oheerfully." A troubled expression passed over Helen's face, and yet with it there was a little twinkle in her eye, as though something amusing had happened. "I saw Mr. Hastings leaving your door as I entered. Had you said anything to make him very happy?or very unhappy? His face wore a most peculiar expression." "I don't know whether ho was happy or unhappy in his mind. The only sensation 110 expressed before me was one of surprise." And she smiled at the thought. "You will forgive me if I ask you a question point blank. I have a feeling that Mr. Hastings made a proposal of marriage to you this afternoon. Am I rinrVit:?" Riml Rush, as auietlv as a man could when very much excited. "Mr. Hurlstono," said Helen, rising, "you forget yourself. Your question is Impertinent." "No, it is not impertinent. No man who loves a woman as I love you would ask her an impertinent question. I must be answered once and for all. Every one says you are engaged to Mr. Hastings. Is it true?" Rush's heart beat so hard and fast that it almost choked him. His eyes were fixed intently upon Helen's, as though he would read every thought that passed through her brain. She hesitated a moment before answering him; and then Bhe said, slowly, in a low, soft voice: "No, I am not engaged to Mr. Hastings. I havo never been engaged to him, and I never shall be."

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, - The message of President Harrison to the Fifty-first congress was read before both houses of that body on Tuesday of last week. It is said to be the lengthiest message of any president, and the reading of it occupied one hour and thirty-five minutes. It is compared in many respects to his inaugural address, and like that paper it is verbose to conscientious detail in pointing out the conditions which prevent the country from being prosperous and happy, even though a remedy for the national ills may not be given. The message starts out with a lengthy review of the relations of this government with foreign nations. With all nations we are at peace. questions 01 a serious character that were likely to arise in 1887 in reference to the Samoan islands are now in course of amicable adjustment. On the question of extradition the message says : "A just and equitable enlargement of the list of offenses for which extradition may be claimed and granted is most desirable between this country and Great Britain. The territory of neither should become a secure harbor for the evil-doers of the other, through any avoidable shortcoming. In this regard a new treaty on this subject between the two powers has been recently negotiated and will soon be laid before the Senate." "Within our own borders," says the message, "a general condition of prosperity prevails. The harvests of the last summer, were exceptionally abundant, and the trade conditions now prevailing seem to promise a successful season for the merchant and manufacturer, and general employment to our working people." . The financial condition of the country is reviewed. Disbursements and receipts in the treasury from all sources show as now on hand an estimated surplus of $43,678,883.01, which, the president thinks, is more likely to be increased than diminished when the actual transactions are written up. in reference to tnis surplus of public funds, he says: "The existence of so large an actual and anticipated surplus should have the immediate attention of congress, with a view to reducing the receipts of the treasuiw to the need-of the governlection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary burden upon our people, and the presence of so large a surplus in the public vaults is a disturbing element in the conduct of private business. It has called into use expedients for putting it into circulation of very questionable propriety. We should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our funds, beyond the requirements of the sinking fund." The president recommends a tariff revision, and on this subject he says: "The necessary reduction in our public revenues can, I am sure, be made without making the latter burden more onerous than the larger, by reason of the disabilit ies and limitations which the process of reduction puts upon both capital and labor. The free list can very safely be extended by placing theron articles that do not offer injurious competition to such domestic products as our home labor can supply." On the question of the internal tax on tobacco, he says: "The removal of in4ni*nol fov ntmn 

WAIT 1/1 VIXV/ lUlViliUi VCV^V U|/VI1 tvviivw nvu?u relieve an important agricultural product from a burden which was imposed only because our revenues from custom duties was insufficient for the public needs. If safe provision against fraud am be devised, the removal of the tax upon spirits, used in the arts and in manufactures, would also offer an unobjectionable method of reducing the surplus." In reference to the money in circulation the message gives the following figures: "The total amount of money of all kinds in circulation on March 1,1878, was $805,793,807, while on October 1, 1889, the total was$l,405,018,000. There was an increase of $293,417,552 in gold coin, of $57,554,100 in standard silver dollars, of $72,311,249 in gold certificates, of $276,619,715 in silver certifiaites, and of $14,073,787 in United States notes, making a total of $713,916,603. There was during the same period a decrease of $114,109,721) in bank circulation, and of $642,481 in subsidiary silver. The net increase was $599,224,193. The circulation per capita has increased about five dollars during the time covered by the table referred to. The total coinage of silver dollars was on November 11,1889, $.343,638,001, of which $283,539,521 were in the treasury vaults, and $60,098,408 were in circulation. Of the amount in the vaults, $277,319,946 were represented by outstanding silver certificates. Leaving $6,219,577 not in circulation and not represented by certificates." On the question of silver coinage the president speaks at lengtn, tne conclusion of his argument being that silver is largely an American production and our legislation should be such as to protect its value. The Terry-Field rase demands presidential recognition, and referring to that affair, he says: "The assault made by David S. Terry upon the person of Justice Field, of the supreme court of the United States, at Lathrop, California, in August last, and the killing of the assailant by a deputy United States Marshal who had been deputed to accompany Justice Field and to protect him from anticipated violence at the hands of Terry, in connection with the legal proceedings which have followed, suggest questions which, in my judgment, are worthy of the atten tion of congress, i reeomnienci inui more definite provision be made by law, not only for the protection of federal officers, but for a full trial of such cases in the United States courts. In recommending such legislation I do not at all impeach either the general adequacy of the provisions made by the State laws for the protection of all citizens or the general good disposition of those charged with the execution of such laws to give protection to the officers of the united States. The duty of protecting its officers as such, and punishing those who assault them on account of their official acts, should not be devolved expressly or by acquiescence, upon locid authorities." In consequence of the increased business now in the United States supreme court, the president says: "The plan of providing some intermediate courts having final appellate jurisdiction of certain classes of ques tions and cases has, I think, received a more general approval from the bench and bar of the country than any other. Without attempting to discuss details, I recommend that provision be made for the establishment of such courts." He also recommends that the sala ries of all district court judges now below $5,000 be raised to that amount. Of "trusts" and trade combinations, the president says: "Earnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of those combinations of capital commonly called "trusts" is a matter of Federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy competition and to monopolize th6 production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation." Referring to the report of the postthat document not"dnly"exfil0rt8~ffie operations of the department for the last fiscal year, but contains many valuable suggestions for the improvement and extension of the service, which are commended to your attention. No other branch of the government has so close a contact with the daily life of the people. Almost every one uses the service it offers and every hour saved in the transmission of the great commercial mail has an actual and possible value that only those engaged in trade can understand. The saving of one day in the transmission ot mails between iNew York and San Francisco, which has recently been accomplished, is an incident worthy of mention. The plan suggested of a supervision of the postoffices .in separate districts that shall involve instruction and suggestion and a rating of the efficiency of the postmasters, would, I have no doubt, greatly improve the service." The pensioning of United States soldiers in the late war is discussed at length, in which the general features of the pension laws are defended, though the president says there are manifest inequalities in the existing pension laws that should be remedied. Reviewing the civil service law, the president concludes: "The reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advance until the present law and its eaual administration 'are well established in the confidence of the people. It will be my pleasure, as it is my duty, to see that the law is executed with firmness and impartiality." The president discusses at some length the railroad mail service of the country and makes suggestions and recommendations for improving its efficiency, omitting, however, the first and most important of all, viz.: to appoint only competent men to the position of postal clerk. All the "rating" and tracts that brother Wanamaker can destribute among the "coons" in a year for supposed faithfulness will not increase their ability. mi. _ .1 ^ - i? 1 J i ne prescient iavors national uiu iu education and says : "The interest of the general government in the education of the people found an early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropriations from the common resources, for the support of education in the new States. No one will deny that it is of the gravest national concern that those who hold the ultimate " control of all public affairs should ly to' 'direct tmrr detetthTTTfc"?ii tem. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form the constitutional power of congress to promote the education of the people is not seriously questioned. I do not think it can be successfully questioned when the form is changed to. that of a direct grant of money from the public treasury. Such aid should be, as it always has been, suggested by some exceptional conditions. The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, the bestowal of the suffrages which soon followed, and the impairment of the ability of theStates wliere these new citizens were chiefly found to adequately provide educational facilities, presented not only exceptional, but unexampled conditions. That the situation has been much ameliorated, there is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happily increased, but a great work remains to be done, and I think the general government should lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grows chiefly out of the condition and needs of the emancipated slave and his descendants the relief should, as far as possible, while necessarily proceeding upon some general lines, be applied to the need that suggested it. It is essential, if much good is to be accomplished, that the sympathy and active interest of the people of the States should be enlisted, and that the methods should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local taxation for school purposes. The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us. They were brought here in chains and'held in the communities where +ho\r urp nnw ohipflv found, bv a cruel slave code. Happily for both races they are now free. They have from a standpoint of ignorance and poverty which was our shame, made remarkable advances in education and in the acquisition of property. They have, as a people, shown themselves to be friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptations of tremenduousstrength. They have their representatives in the national cemeteries where a grateful government has gathered the ashes of those who died in its defense. They have furnished to our regular army regiments that have won high praise from their commanding officers for courage and soldierly qualities, and for fidelity to the enlistment. In civil life they are now the toilers of their communities, making their full contributions to the winding streams of prosperity which these communities are receiving. Their sudden withdrawal would stop production and bring disorder into the household as well as the shop. Generally they do not desire to quit their homes, and their employers resent the inteference of emigration agents who seek to stimulate such a desire. The Republican message appropriately closes with reference to the black man and the ballot, in the following words: "Hut notwithstanding all this, in all parts of our country where the colored population is large, the people of that race are, by various devices, deprived .of any effective exercises of their political rights, and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the union is wronged. It has been the hope of every patriot, that a sense of justice and of respect for the law would work a gradual cure of these flagrant evils. Surely no one supposes that the present can be accepted as a permanent condition. If it is said that these communities must work out this problem for themselves, we have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Do they suggest any solution? When, and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he, in fact, to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law ? When is that equality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors, to be restored ? This generation should courteously face these grave questions, and not leave them as a heritage of voe to the next. The consultation shjuld proceed with candor, calmness md great patience, upon the lines of justice and humanity, not of prejudice or cruelty. No question in our country can be at rest except upon the firm base of justice and of the law. I earnestly invoke the attention of congress to the consideration of such measures within its well defined constitutional powers as will secure to our people a free exercise of the right of suffrage and every other right under the constitution, and laws of the United States. No evil, however deplorable, can justify the assumption either on the part of the executive or of congress of powers not granted, but both will be highly blameable if all the powers granted are not wisely and firmly used to correct these evils. The power to take the whole direction and control of the election of members of the house of representatives is clearly given to the general government. A partial and qualified supervision of these elections is now provided for by law and in my opinion this law may be so strengthened and extended as to secure on the whole by a lawmaking an tTifc b?oC&Se3"bi such election into federal control. me colored man snouid oe protected in all of his relations to the federal government, whether as litigant, juror or witness in our courts, as an elector for members of congress, or as a peaceful traveler upon our interstate railways." miscellaneous grading. AS OIL 

VOLCANO. Petroleum, or "rock oil," according to the present theory of its origin, is a distillate from the remains of marine life, both animal and vegetable. It sometimes finds its way to the top of the ground and forms springs, as does water; but it is more frequently held down, at a great pressure, by hard, impervious rocky strata, lying above the oil-bearing beds; and when in such cases a hole, or "well," is drilled down to it, through the superincumbent mass, it gushes up with great force. Within the last ten years the "holy land" of the Parsees has become the seat of a vast petroleum trade. Baku is now a grand kerosene oil refinery. The industry is not yet as fully developed there as in our own oil region of Pensylvania. Pennsylvania has nearly thirty thousand oil wells, against five hundred at Baku. But the Ave hundred. Baku wells are discharging as much petroleum to-day as tne thirty thousand American wells. At Baku the oil is nearer the surface ofthe ground than in Pennsylvania. American oil-wells average nearly fifteen hundred feet in depth, while in Baku the average depth is scarcely six hundred feet. In America, too, the diameter of oil-wells is but about five inches, while those at Baku are rarely drilled less than a foot in diameter. The discharge of oil and gas from some of the wells at Baku nas been so profuse and violent that a mere statement of the facts seems too marvelous for belief. These facts, however, come to us well attested. In one case where a well was being drilled, the auger, or drill, at a depth of Ave hundred and seventy feet, suddenly penetrated to the oil strata and was blown bodily out of the shaft with tremendous violence. With a roar that could be plainly heard at a distance of two miles, the gas blew off for some minutes, and uiusibi'iui. 1 1 u?" The derrick which had supported the drill was seventy feet in height. The jet of oil and sand blew away the top of the derrick and rose two hundred feet above it. All efforts to check the discharge by blocking the shaft proved useless. Long plugs, and even huge stones, were blown aside like feathers. Throughout September and October this geyser continued to disgorge oil at the rate of nearly two millions of gallons a day. Pools and lakes, broad and deep enough to row boats on, were formed on the adjacent plain, and a good sized brook of petroleum flowed from them down to the sea. The sand which was vomited forth with the oil accumulated in huge drifts, burying the neighboring derricks along with several shops, tanks and other buildings. The sand and oil drifted first to one side and then to the other, according to the direction of the wind, and a vast mound was formed, having a saucer-shaped depression, or crater, at the centre, whence the jet issued. This central orifice, or crater, constantly obstructed by the sand, presented the appearance of a wildly seething caldron, which it was dangerous to approach. All the fires in the vicinity were extinguished, to prevent explosions and conflagrations. Thus, day after day and week after week, this oil-fountain continued to play, presenting, it is stated by those who saw it, a truly grand and memorable spectacle. It is estimated that not less than five hundred thousand tons of oil were spouted forth during the months of its unrestricted flow, nearly all of which ran to waste! In America this crude oil would have been worth at least five millions of dollars; yet the unfortunate company that drilled the well, beiner quite unable to control it, was ruined by the damages which it occasioned to its neighbors. Unwittingly a monster had been let loose which no one could capture or curb. * The Russian government was at last appealed to for assistance, and two imperial engineers visited Baku, to see what could be done to this end. They were able to devise nothing which succeeded, however, and it was not until late in December of that year, when the geyser had spent its full violence, that a resident engineer succeeded in fixing a cap of boiler iron over the mouth of the orifice and effectually "gagging" it.
