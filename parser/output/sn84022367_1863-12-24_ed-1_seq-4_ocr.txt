THE RUTLAND WEEKLY HERALD: THURSDAY. DECEMBER 24. IH68. THURSDAY, DEC. 24, 1863. , Tins Next Opposition Move It is ataled by the Washington Correspondent f the Chicago Tritun that the next move f the opposition is to be a general assault pea Uie Now England Slates and capit alist, la addition to their wordy attacks poa New England, which they have be fore attempted with no very encouraging aoecess, they will charge that the capital ists are e xclusively benefitted, while the laboring classes are impoverished by the war, and thus . frighten the latter out of their support of the government in its prosecution. As, upon the success of this war for the preservation of democratic government against an aristocratic rebel lion will depend the very existence of the people's rights, this attempt, if made, will of eourso be as futile as all the un patriotic schemes of copperheads. llow much reliance is to be placed up on the report that this is the next thing ou the opposition programme, we will not un dertake to say. We notice, however, that attacks upon New England are being re newed! n tue shape, just now, of com plaints regarding the chairmanships of the standing committees in Congress, and es pecially in the Senate. Tho Albaay Ar. gas says that there are thirty-three stand ing -committees of the Senate, and that "New England interests" have more than half the chairmanships. This is only an exaggeration of a down or so, as to the number of the committees, which is doing pretty well fertlw Argus. The Rochester (N. Y.) Democrat estimates that accord ing to their numbers the New England Senators should have about one-third of the chairmanships. They get something more than that proportion, because so many them are seuior Senators. It is almost an invariable custom in both Houses of Congress to give the older and snore experienced members the first places on committees. Canadian Reciprocity. Ten years ago what is known as the " Reciprocity Treaty " with Canada w6 ratified. The " reciprocity " has proved to be essential ly one-sided. Under its terme most Ca nadian productions have been admitted free of duty , into the United States, but not so United States manufactures into Canada. The treaty was expected n least to secure us some gratitude and good will on the part of Canada f Qf ,hig one-Bed, unreciprocated " re jiprocity But of all peoples, the Car adian8 have been the most hostile to up t durjg our na tional calamity . ' The t- rescue ol jjjg murdering . pirates of tne Chesapeake by the "blue-noses" 0f Halifax is the latest exhibition of th provincial jealousy and atrtd with "hicTi our northern neighbors, generally, regard us. The treaty with Canada, fceen a failure both in a busi ness, and friendly point of view, and will ieubttess be speedily terminated. ...;-,:i' The Monitors -Under recent experi ences, the conviction is being reached that while the Monitors are far in advanee of anything else afloat for harbor attack and tkifense, they are not cmHy unfit for -ocean Navigation, but are by no means proof against flirts supplied with the improved guns of die present day. The reported Dismasts to thk Ironclads. The New York Tribune's Washington correspondent says that the paragraph, ostensibly telegraphed from Fortress Monroe, purporting to give ex tract from Richmond papers of the 19th with rogard to the disabling of the Iron sides and twe of the monitors, never came over the wires from Fortress Monroe, nor has any Richmond paper of the 10th beeu received there. So General Cutler tele graphs ; adding that he believes the whole story to be a canard. JGiSfT" The New York Tribune notices the rumor that a peace convention is to be held in that city as Boon as the necessary preliminaries can be arrang.nl, at which Chief Justice Taney will be nominated for the Presidency, and Thomas II. Sey mour of Conn., for Vice President. The Tribune thinks Jeff. Davis and Horatio Seymour will be unwarrantably neglected by such an arrangement. Richt to the Toikt. The Missouri Democrat, iu an article headed " Immedi ate and Gradual Emancipationists," says : " Some obscurity is minds of people abroad as to the real differ'.?" between the parties above named, in the S.t f Missouri, would, perhaps, make a won? of explanation necessary. The difference j is easily stated. Tho immediate eman cipationists want to get rid of slavery as soon as they can the gradual emancipa tionists want to keep slavery as long as they can. The former desires emancipa tion from choice the latter are willing to take it when they can't help them- j The immediate emancipationists have the upper hands in Missouri, and afte-. long(Tering it seems that they are d 0 to be themselves emancipated from tne military control of Gen.

The prospe . . j.uisoun win iaKe eraancip and those Republicans who grumble about his irascibility of disposition, are those who fear his honest exposures of humbugs. There is no discount on Thad Stevens. JTjC It seems that Colfax is not the first editor elected to the Speakership, as has been stated. Gen. Banks was a newspaper man. At one time he con ducted a paper in Woburn, Mass., at another time be edited a paper in Wal tham, Mass., and was afterwards associate editor of the Boston Daily Times, when that paper was one of the Democratic organs of New England, and before llan toul and Banks .broke with that party am! struck hands with the Free Soilers of Massachusetts. engine at the time of the explosion, Was so much injured that he is not expected to recover.

' ; The only thing to be regretted by Ver: TOonters is that in this fair their State made a comparatively meagre show. Vermont has done very much in other ways for the benefit of . the sick and wounded soldiers, but she was behind her sister states in this instance. Judge Bas se, nevertheless said, in his closing ad dress, "We owe especial thanks to the citizens Of New Hampshire and Vermont. They have beeu as liberal of their beunty. as they kave i heretofore been lavish of their blood.." ' ! ''' CougreMlonal lnrideula. The editor of the Chicago Journal, writing from Washiugton, mentions an amusiLg scene in the House of Represen tatives when the election of Clerk took place. After Etheridge, the old Clerk, had done all he could or dared to do to prevent the organisation of the House, or throw the control into the hands of the Copperhead minority, Mr. Mallorv, of Kentucky, had the impudence to appd I to the iHayitaHumtjf of the Lmon mem bers to induce them to vote for the said Etheridge ; whereupon the veteran, Thad. Stevens, of Pennsylvania cold, sarcastic, and able rote slowly from his seat and said: "Mr. Speaker Such Itvily is un leconiing this House," and Thad. s?t down. It was the ablest speech in its tjftcts thus ar delivered. The other day the double-dyed Copper head and rebej sympathizer, Senator Pow ell, of Kentucky, insolently took the Sen ate to task because ha and the other oppo sition Senators were not consulted in the formation of the committees, and in the oonjj of the discussion which ensued, Mr. Re treatea the " Democrats " with the following bit of history. It must have made their ears tingle : Mav I be allowed a word, sir t 1 uo not know what the question is; but 1 think if there be a member here who has a riplit to speak ef the experiences ot be ing in a minority of this floor, I am that man. I have been here ior many years ; and I think it is within a very short pe riod that ever I, or anybody with whom I ever acted, was consulted in regard to the formation of the committees. I remember on one occasion I think, sir, you will re member the same a list of committees were reported here, got up I do not know how, and I was omitted altogether trom any committee, and so wa3 my excellent friend on the lefl (Mr. Sumner), and so was the distinguished gentleman who now stands at the head of the Treasury of the United States. We were omitted alto gether, and on instituting some little in quiry of the Democratic oligarchy that ruled the Senate as to why it was done, were politely intormed that we did not be long to a healthy political organization, and therefore we had beeu left off the com mittees entirely.' But, sir, finally my health got so, politically, that this same party did put me at the tail end of the Com'mitiee on Private Land Claims, loud laughter where 1 served without remon strance or reproach. A Washington correspondent of the New Hampshire Statesman says Emerson Etheridse was recently introduced tq Bru tus J. Clay, of Kentucky, inrt immedi ately began to denounce the government. Mr. Clay, after hearine his tempest a few moments, replied: " Well, Mr. Etheridge, this is pretty rough. Before the war, when I was a democrat, I used to bear of you down in Tennessee as an abolitionist. You must have lately changed your views." This was somewhat wilting to the retiring clerk, who supposed he had got a man after his own heart. He plucked up cour age, however, and went into another ti rade. Mr. Clay thereupon, with calmness mingled with manifest indignation, rising to his full hight, interrupted : "Well, sir, this is our first meeting. Your language, sir, seems to me atrocious, and all I have to say to you is, that when men talk thus down in Kentucky, we regard them as se cessionists, and treat them accordingly." 

THURSDAY, DEC. 24, 1863. General Order No. U. STATE OF VERMONT. Adjutant awi Jntctor Geuerar OtHct, ) Woodstock, Dea 1, 1803. Official information having been receiv ed, that men mustered into new organiza tions will be credited in reduction of the quotas under the call for 300,000 volun teers, it is ordered s follows : ' 1. The selectmen of the several towns in this State will not allow this information to interfere with their effort to fill their quotas for old regiments, as assigned iu General Order No. 2, dated November 2, 1863, but will proceed, with all due dili gence, to fill their quotas as heretofore di rected.

Every effort will be used by the Governor of the Stste to secure for the men of the regiment the same government bounties and all the advantages which are receivad by recruits for other regiments, and it is confidently expected and desired ' that the several recruiting officers for the regiment, and the selectmen ot the several towns, will promote the filling of the regi" raent as soon as is practicable ; and, when mustered, although it should be subseouent to the fifth of January, the men will be credited to i'ne towns from which they en list; towards their deficiency of the draft, or under ay" lurther call which may be made t-V rdr of Ilia Excellency, J.

In this case all the members of the Brigade will hav? a furlough of thirty days and will then probably spend another month at their rendezvous in reorganizing their regiments before they return to the field.
