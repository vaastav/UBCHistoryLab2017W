The discussion commenced soon after the national election and at. present Is occupying the attention of everyone who Is at all Interested In politic. Naturally the principal Interest rests in the question ns to who shall he the nominees for mayor. It Is probable on the democratic side that there will be no one to contest the renomlnallon of the prene.it mayor, James R Martin. Mayor Mart'n Is a candidate for re nomlnaMon and the member of his party generally declare he has showed himself an executive of unusual and vigorous ability.
