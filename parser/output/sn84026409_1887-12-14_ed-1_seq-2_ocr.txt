In more ways than one it is one of the most remarkable document of the kind ever sent to an American Congress. It is short and confines itself strictly to the one topic that of reducing the public revenue. All other question are excluded as of minor interest or im portance. Of all the messages that have emanated from the White House there has not leen one do openly out and out hostile to American capital and lalsir as this. Not one that has so decidedly at tacked the American system of manu factures. He would let the entire system of internal revenue stand and would reduce the surplus by a broad, w holesale slaugh ter of the Protective dut ies. He declares that the internal taxes affect nothing but luxuries, and aims his whole blow at the tariff laws. He would place wool, iron ore, coal and luiutxr on the free list and would greatly reduce if he did not alto gether abolish the duties on manufac tured article that are imjiorted anil come into competition w ith our ow n American manufacture. Hie President has placed liimsvlf and party fairly and squarely on Free-trade and bravely throws down the gauge of tattle. He is to be credited for bis courage in attacking Protection and of inviting battle Is taeen American in dustry and its opponents, between the friends and the enemies of American manufactures, between the policy of Pro tection and of atisolute Free-trade. It is very questionable whether the Piesident will be able to carry w ith him a sufficient number of hid party in Congress to secure legislation in accordance with his recom mendations. Should he do so it would Jiossibly result in his defeat for a re-nomination. His message, in all human probability will tcure the election of a Kcubliin to be his auivessor. The country is not ready for Free-trade just vet. A KVMBERof important cabinet changes were made by the President last wreck. Lucius Quintius Curtius Lamar, Secre tary of the Interior, was nominated for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and his place is filled by the transfer of W. F. Vilas from the office of Postmaster jeoerl. Don M. Pie kiiidon. of Miebi ia has been appointed to fill the place vacated bv Mr. Vila and Charles a Fair child, of New York, has been appointed Secretary of the Treasury. Mr Fair child has been discharging the duties of Secretary of the Treasury for some unie past. The nomination of Lamar will probably I confirmed, as be was for mally amem1.r of the Senate, althongh there are grave objections to it. He was , jKoesMonist of the most pronounced type and the following is the way Sena tor Ingalls sized him up in a conversa tion held Friday. He said : " I presume Mr. Lmar will be confirmed, a be if no wone than many other appoiot mtuta the President has beerc compelled to make in the iutcrwu of lei's party in the South. Mr. Lamar b.a been intimately and prominently connected with political affairs for nearly thirty year. He never has been admitted to practice a the Bar of the Su preme Court. He was only classified as a lawyer, never having seriously engaeed in the practice of the profoeion. In Congress before the war lie was the most vwieiu. truculent and malevolent of all the secession leaders in his avowed hostility to the Fniou ami his advocacy of the constitutionality of slavery and secession. Having been the confidential friend of Jefferson Davit and the Diplomatic aelit of the Confederacy, at theclsise oftlie war he elixapir d fnim public aflairs and became identified with a provincial institution of learning in Mi.-is-sippi as nominal Profirtsor of Law. It is not known that he ever appeared in court in the interval between the death of the Confeder acy and his re-entrance into public life, ex cept t defend murderers and assassins w ho were charged with violating the election laws and overthrowing )y blood and riot the silitiial rights of the freedmen of the .South. Mr. Lamar entered the Senate a the heneficiary of tire most brutal and inhuman conspiracy which ever disgraced hnmaiiity. It was suljsequc-iitly known as the Missis sippi plan, and was the invention of his quondam colleague, the present Senator, Mr. ti.-ore. Mr. Ucinar's Iitical simvrity is illustrated by Lis declaration in the Senate that Jefferson Davis would occupy a niche in history by the side of John Hampden and fieeinre Washinirton.and his intellc-tual dex terity is evident hy his eulogy of liarli- Sunnier in the North and John C. Calhoun in the Smth. lie re presents everything had in the past, dangerous in the present, and ominous in the future." 51k. Larva km rank at the bar would never have made him a Supreme Court Judge. This is the testimony of many w ho are familiar with his professional ca reer, and who declare that his actual le gal experience has been inconsiderable. Mr. Lamar's still rcliellious sentiments, as exemplified by his angry denunciation only two wears ago of those who dared to call Jefferson Davis "a traitor," do not piiit to him as a man to Is intrusted a ith the devision of matters growing out of the late war, and his responsibility for Mississippi repudiation is not reassuring as to the stand he might take upon similar questions. It remains to lie seen wheth er personal and social influence, and Sen atorial good-fellowshsp, will make his way to confirmation easy. AVir York Tri tium: Mr. Blaikk is a private citizen, at pres ent traveling in Eurcqie. The President of the United States after dome months of incubation, delivers a stump speech on the tariff, in place of the annual message which bis official duty requires. Twenty four hours after its publication in this country there come from Mr. Blaine in Eumie a reply so thoroughly American in spirit, no keen in its comprehension of American interests and needs, so accurate in facts and so crushing and- complete in its argument, that leading papers of the jiarty which supports Mr. Cleveland do not dare to place it before their readers. His friends see that the reply w ill kindle the enthusiasm of millions of Americans for the policy of the Republican party, and for the strong leader who so swiftly and surely represents American interests and American thought. Mr. Cleveland's message not only divides and dismays his friends, but delight the London newspa pers and the British manufacturers. The fatal blunder of Mr. Cleveland was In attempting to make the people take it for granted that duties for the protection of home industry must lie removed or lowered, in order, to diminish the reve nue. The people know Wtter. Mr. T.laine, three thousand miles away, tells the President that taxes on tobacco and on spirits used in manufactures can be cut off, and the tax on whiskey applied to the defense of seaports, and that it is simply inexcusable to retain internal war taxes for no better purpose than to de prive home industries of the legitimate measure of defence which a tariff ade quate to raise the needed revenue would give. Coast defence, so ably and elo quently urged by Mr. Tilden, has never lieen fairly considered by Mr. Cleveland, and may easily be forgotten by a Presi dent w ho values British commendation, courts British favor, and considers Brit ish rather than American interest. lrotecticn for home industries has not been directly a-ailed by any lresident except Mr. Cleveland since James Bu chanan went out of office iu disgrace. It remains to be seen whether Iresidcnt Cleveland can w ith safety rely upon tlie influence of importing agents and foreign manufacturers, even in New York and New Jersey, to uphold him in trying to break down the tariff which basso grand ly developed and now defends American industry. A". J". TVihuur. Cincinnati Fldelioy Bank Scandal. CinsKATi, Dec. 8. The Krufuirer to-day published fac-simile cipher letters which purport to have been sent while in jail by ex-Vice President Harper, now on trial, to Miss Josie Holmes, his former exchange clerk. The letters are as ardent as those of any lover could be. Ill the first one he in structed her about what she should say in her testimony.

Hopkins aim Charles was correspond! iikI. kind to Harjier and be came his messenger to carry letters to and front Miss Holmes. While performing this office lee began to suect thai Harjier was arranging to shirk upon his father the re sponsibility of all transactions with the grain Iwokem. and young Hopkins, m plaee Har per witliin his power, conceived lice design of coliccaling the letters and delivering ver bal nxitsatre only. In the Court room to day Harper gave his usual polite attention to his wife, and showed but little trace of trou ble. His wife?, however, rat like a statute, as though oblivious to her surroundings. Tlierr is no doubt of tlee authenticity of the letters, and they place in the true light the relation between the ex-banker and his fair c-lerk. The proowution to-day closed it evi- lence in the case. Edward M.

CAPTURED BY CHICAGO. The National Republican Conven tion Will Be Held There. WisHiifiTcx. Iec if. CLicago, fr the third timti. has won the contest for the Re publican National Convention priw. Three ballots we re required to determine the mat ter, but the victory of the Windy City when it was won was decisive. Juas-1. IS, was determined as the date. The committee met at the Arlington hotel. Chairman Jones, in calling the meeting to order, said : "GnKTLKXes of THE ( 'ow aiTTEK : As sta ged ill the call, this meeting is for the pur pose of selecting a lime and place for hold ing theiext Rejiulelk-an National Conven tion : al. to consider such other matter as may be brought before it" AS everything connected, however re motely, with tiie government of this great country is important, our action to-lay may have far-reaching results.

'We may congratulate ours-lv on the improved prospects of the Rejiublican parry since tlie National Committee met in this city four years ago for the aame purpose that we are now asse-miiled. At that lime the majority against the Kejmblican lrty in the North at the last preceding general State elections counted up into the hundreds of thousands. The great Btates of New York, Pennsylvania and Olsio had Democratic tMiveniors. New York's was elected by nearly 2oO.WO plurality, which was reduced for the same candielate at the Presidential election to less than, Liu". " Though by accident the Itemocratic par ty have the Presidency and the prestige of success, the signs are auspicious for the elec tion of a lb-publican President in 1HSS. The momentum acquired by i years of the prev alence of Republican principles has not yet lost its force, and the material interests of the country are still prosiering as the rewult of Repuhlie-an industrial legislagation. Re cent utterances, however, imlicate a deter mination to end this prosperity by adverse legislation forced upon the country by an administration hostile to American indus try ; and also indicate the necessity of the return to power of the Republican 'arty in the National liovernmeiit so that American industry, wool growing and sugar raising, equally with iron making and textde pro duction, may have continued prosierity, and the employes constant employment and continuesl gesid wages, such as American workmen should receive.' c hic aii's rsrL Men.

This proposi tion was finally amendc-d, and as adoptee! allows Dakota and Washington Territory each four contingent de-legates in addition to the two legular de-legates. Tiie chairman and secretary of the committee were then instructed to prepare the call lor the conven tion. A reepiest from the National Republi can League of Washington to be iermitted to do campaign work in the Southern Slates under the direction of National Commiltec, was graiitcsl.

He asked of the committee some recognition of the cause of labor. He wanted them to further the views of his or ganization for a hich protective tariff, a strong navy, more coast de-fenses, interna! improvements and compulsory education. He asked the enfranchisement of the w hite slave. On motion of Mr. Conger, of Ohio, the hearty co-o-ratiou of the committee was Virted to the men whom Mr. Callainie represcnte-el.

WHAT BLAINE SAYS. Hie Views on Cleveland's Extraor dinary Message Repeal the To bacco Tax but Let That on Whiskey Remain. The Paris correspondent of tbe New York Tr'Jj-me cables a report to that paier. giving the views of Mr. Blaine on the President's message. Mr. Blaine said to the Tribune representa tive: ' I have been reading an abstract of the President's message and have been especial ly interested in the comments of the London papers. Those paiers all assume to declare the message is a free trade manifesto, and evidently are anticipating an enlarged mar ket for englUh fabrics in the United States as a consequence of the President's recom mendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." ' You elon't mean ai-tual free trade without duty?" queried the reporter. " No," replied Blaine. Nor do the Lon don paiers mean that. They simply mean that the Prcsiilent has recommended what in the United Statcae is known as a revenue tariff, rejecting the protective fenture as an object and not even permitting protection to result freely as an inejideiu to revenue duties." " I do not know that I clearly comprehend that last point," said the retainer. "I mean," said Mr. Rlaine. "that for the first time in tlie history of the United States the President recommends retaining the in ternal tax in order thut the tariff may be fonvel elown even be-low the fair revenue standard. He recommends that the tax on tobac-co be retained, and thus that many mil iums annually shall he levied on a domestic produirt which would far better come from a tariff on foreign fabrics." " I favor the rejieal of the toiiai-co lax," said Mr. Klaine, "and I would urge that it 1m- clone tit once, even before the Christmas holidays. It would, in the first place, bring great relief to growers of tobacco all over the country unci would materially les-eii the price of the article to consume rs. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The Pres ident calls it a luxury, but it is a luxury in no oilier sense than tc-a and coffee an' luxu ries. The only excuse for such a tax is the actual necessity under which the govern ment found itself during the war and the year's immediately following. To letaiti the tax now in order to destniy the protection which would incidentally flow from raising the same amount of motley on foreign im iorts is certainly a most extraordinary poli cy lor our government." ' would you advise the refieal of the ,'. !. -key lax also, Mr. Blaiue?" No 1 would not. Other considerations (ban those of financial administration are to Ik- tiiken in account with regard to wT.ike-y. Thee is a mora! side to it. To chca(M-ti the p'.e of whiskey is to increase tiie consump tion enormously. There would be no sense iu unriug tbe reform wrought by hixh li-ci'i.M- in other State's if the- NatioiiMl tinvern-ini-itt neutralises the gesid etVec-l by making whiskey within the ivach of every one- tit :!0 evil's a gallon. Whiskey would he every v. ben' distilled if tlie surveillance of the gov ernment were withdrawn by the remission of the tax, and illicit sales could not then lie prevented even by a policy as rigorous and searching as thai with which Russia pursues the Nihilist. It would destroy high license at once in all the States. Whiskey has elone a vast deal of harm in the United Suites. I would try to make it to do sonic gesnl. 1 would use the tax to fortify our cities on the scsihoanl. ltT view of the powerful letter ad dressed to the Ilcmocratic iarty on the sub ject of fortification by the late Samuel J. Tilden iu lotvi, I am amazed that no atten tion hits been ("aid to the subjec t by the lVnusTutic administration." Further, Mr. Itlaiue informed the Tribmit representative that he would maintain the tax on whiskey " so long as there was any whiskey to tax, and when the National (iov ernmcnt would have no use for the money I would divide the tax among the Fesle-nil Union with Ihe -cilic object of ligbti'liing the lax on real estate. The houses and farms of the whole country ay too large a pro(ior tion of Hie total taxes. If ultimately relief could be given in that dins'! ion it would in my judgment, lie a wise and hciiefiecut pilicy." Presidential Nominations. Wasiiinoton, Dec. 7: The President se-nt the following nominations to the Senate to day : Lucius y. C. Lamar, of Missippi, to lie As sociate Jusiiie of tlie Supreme Court of the United Slates.

Sigournery Iltiller. of Massae-hnse-li, lo I Second Comptroller oftlie Treasury. James W. Hyatt, of Connecticut to be Treasurer of the United Slates. " Senatorial courtsey." which has usually led to the compliment of a confirmation without reference lo a committee when a Senator or ex -Senator has been nominated to any other onii, has never prevailed in resjwetto nominations lei positions of the bench of the Supreme Court. The last case preceding that of Mr. Lamar was that of Mr. Conkling. who had been out of the Senate a much shorter period than that of Mr. Ijiniar. Mr. (inkling's nomination was sent lo tbe Judicat-y Committee and reported hack. He was oonlirnusl by the Senate and then de el i lies 1 the citrice. It in probable tllat the nominations sent to the Senate will not lie formally laid before the body until the com mittees are formed. Mr. Dickinson will be the youngest mem ler of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet. He was tiom at Auburn, N. Y.. in 1843. His father went to Michigan when Don was a small boy. The new p.istmasteT General was educated at the Stale University at Ann Arbor, graduating iu IsCjG. Three years later lie received his diploma from tlie law school and began lo prae-tiee. He look into partnership with him ancrtlier Dickinson (Julian C), who was no kin whatever to him. The two prospered and separated, but Don held together the large business. Tie firm is now Dickinson, Hosiner ct Thurber. Mr. Dickinson is said to be worth half a million, and Mrs. Dickinson, who was a Grand Rapids girl, has a fortune of tlfrMMU in herown right. They have only one-child, a little irirl three years old. Remarkable Faith Cure. Toleihi. O., Iec. 8. The faith cure peo ple are holding cnia ded meetings here daily.

A Mr. Andrews has been restored and arose and walked last night for the first time in two years. David Wynn walked yesterday for the first time in years. Another was the case of Mm. George Stahl, who could not walk, but who was healed by nutk. Press Comments on the Message. Cleveland X.r (Rep ): The Dunoe-ratic party has uot. since tbe war, dared to come out so oieiily in favor of a reduction of the tariff. Omaha fUpuMic-i Rep.; :" There is no statement in the message favoring taritJ for revenue only that lias not been met by con vincing connter statements.". St. Louis Rf)mMcitn (Dem.): The Presi dent's message means business. Mr. Ran dall must fall in or full out. He can do either be pleases, but he must do one or the other. ; ' ' Detroit Tr ibui (Rep): Thanks, Mr. Cleveland, lor the issue you bave raised. On that issue the Repul!ii-an fKirty will gla.lly do battle iu 1 and win in every Northern State. .- , New York San (Dem.) : It is a bold thing to do. and the President deserves credit for the plainness of his speech. Nobody can accuse him of hedging, of haggling, or juggling with words. New Orleans Stoic (Dem.) : In short, it is a sound, healthy Demcjcratic document, and outlines the plan of campaign by w hich the Democratic President must be elected next year. Kansas City Journal (Rep.): The Presi dent's message is a confession, in three col umns, of the iiieroiupetency of the party which is now responsible for the management of the government. Philadelphia Surth Ameriran (Rep.) : Tlie country now knows exactly where Mr. Cleveland stands, and if it doe not approve of his position, it also knows just what to do when the proper time arrives. Atlanta VotutitutUm (Dc-ni.) : That a man of prscticai common sense like Cleveland should walk into such a trap is surprising, but he has not walked in without a protest, as his reference to the Chicago platform shows. New York i'leainc Jtut (Mugwump) : Mr. Randall and his handful, who have fought every change in the tariff, large and small may now go over lo the enemy. There is no more room for them in any party which sustains Mr. Cleveland. Hartford GitimtU Rep.) : It is a free trade argument all the way through, and while he hyporcritically liegs that free trade and pro tection be drop(ied fr uit discussion, the fact remains that every argument he makes is directly an argume-nt for free trade Boston TruiWT(Re p.) : His grossest blun der is whrn he says that "the question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant." The vital issue is free trade versus protection. The President has rendered one imirtant service in that he has made this issue dis tinct.

New York 77in (Mugwump) : If the pro tee:tionist in the Democratic wrty carry out their own desires, or to do what they have continually de-dared that they would do, Mr. Cleveland has done the one thing by '. which he could imperil the pnreiect of his 1 own renomination. ' Atlanta Gmrtitution (Dem.): The message oftlie Preside-nl conererns itself solely with I the tariff question, and he discusses almost exclusively from the standisiint of lire'r ' Bill Morrison, of Illinois, who was let at j home by his esteemed constitutcni.-' ou ac- count of his extreme views, i New Orleans Tunrt-I'tmncrat (lli-m.1 ; We do not agree with the Peresidenl in regard to the non-reduction of the tobacco tax. It ; is true that tobacco is not a necessity, but j the tax is troubleseome anil burdensome lo the agricultural pnslucer, and cost of its collection is considerable. lndianaiolis Jcncmet; Politically, the mes- sage is a terrible arraignment of the Demo cratic party. 1 he Democracy have lor sev eral years had control of the House of Repre sentatives, where alone revenue measures can orginate. They have neither amended the tariff nor made any honest effort to do so. Cincinnati CommerrUil Gazette (Rep.): The Republican party would reduce the revenue. Mr. Cleveland's recommendations, while attacking American industries, would in crease the revenue. Thus, while home lalsir would be impoverished, there would be an increase rather than a reduction in the revenue. Louisville Courier Journal (iK-m.) : To the party itself the President's message makes clear that in 1SH8 it will be tariff reform or nothing. No wonts could have be-en spoken which will so effectually sevtirethe harmony which so many de-ire as the clear, bold, emphatic declaration of iarty principle anil party purt,se coming from the President. New York Trihunr f Rep.) : Credit is due to the President for making the issue boldly and distinctly, so that no man ran hereafter claim, with a show of reason, that the the ories and aims of ultra opisirients of pro tection have not ill him a zealous advocate. On the issue thus presented, the ieoilci csin not dcciele I'Si soon, and upon their decision will large-ly dcieud their future prosx-rity. Philadelphia Vi(Rcp.): Mr. Cleveland has fixes! the isisitioti of his party, anil there is no escaie from it. Few even of tiiose who fully agree with him would have ventured as far as he has gone, hut now that he has plunged into the abyss the-y must follow him. The small band of Democratic protec tionists are left stratide-d and homeless, but the Democratic party must go with the President . New York I'rat (Rep.): Upon the whole the message is a declaration in tivorof tariff for revenue only, and as such it must be re garded. If Mr. Cleveland is U be the nominee of the IVmocratic party in ls.s.sthe protection and free-trade issue will lie clearly drawn. His utterances are those of a free trader, his arguments are in the same line, and to put his proposals into execution would destniy American, industry, turn our home market over lo foreigners, and reduce tlie compensation of those who labor for a liv ing. Anarchist Most's Sentence. New York, Dec. 8. Johann Most, the An archist, who was convicted of misdemeanor, was arraigned in the General Sessions Court to-day. His counsel, Mr. Howe, argued for a new trial, contending that Most had not been cxinvictc-d on any fair evidence, but that an unfair prejudice had been instilled into the case. Assistant Distrii-t Attorney Nicoll said in reply that he heis?d Judge Cowing would not subvert all precedents of law by reviewing the verdiert. Judge Cowing said he would deny the mo tion, hut that he would grant a certifieate lo the Supreme Court in Uener.il Term, when the whole case might be bean). When Ihe Clerk of the Court asked Most what be had to say why sentence should not be pronounced on him Most appealed lo the Judge te use his discretion in setting aside the verdict and protested his innocence, say his conviction had been brought aiiout by perjury and prejudice. Judge Cowing'sonly reply was: "The sentence of ihe Court is that you be confined in the penitentiary for a period of one year without the fine." A Pistol In the French Deputies. Pakis, Dec. 10. M.

THREE IMPORTANT DECISIONS. Validity of the Prohibition Law In Kansas Affirmed. The first opinion was read by Justice Matthews, and was conc-nrred in by all the oilier Justices except Harlan. It sustains the position of Ihe State of Virginia in what is familiarly known as the "coupon case." and reverses the position assumed towards Slate authorities' by tbe Circuit Jud:e Bond, w!m caused certain of them to be imprisoned for disobeying; a restraining order forbidding them to bring suits for the collection of taxes in casus where tenders have been made of lax receivable coupons cut from Sta'e Kinds. The Supreme Court in other words, now decides that the Federal power cannot be legally exercised to prevent tlie State of Virginia from pursuing any course she may choose with regard to her State debt, which was a contract made, not by individuals with individuals, but by outside individuals with a State. The imprisoned officials are, therefore, discharged ; and the effect of the decision, in the second place, upon the debt question, will undoubtedly be to settle that question finally and forever. The English creditors will now probably accept the set tlement offered them hy the last Legislature of Virginia, and thus end this vexatious matter. The other decision was of yet greater im portance, sustaining, as it did, the constitu tionality of the prohibitory law of Kansas. It will be remembered that this was regarded as a test case, involving the right of a State or other community to pass laws calculated to break up an established business, like that of liquor selling. It was claimed on be half of the liquor interest, that in coses where liquor seller's business had been in terferred with by such laws, they were entitled to compensation, and that proh ihi tory laws were unconstitutional, because they abridged the liberty of the citize-u and destroyed his property without due cause. The Court held that the right of determining w hat measures are necessary for the preserva tion of the public morals, health and sat'ety had therefore been vested in the States by the constitutional right given them under the police power to regulate their own in ternal concerns. The State of Kansas bad a right to prohibit the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away the projierty oftlie brewers. It simply abated a nuisance. The preqierty is not taken away from its owners ; they are only prohibited from using it for a siecific purpose which the Legislature de clared to be injurious to the comniiity. If the Supreme Court hail sustained this claim it is hardly possible to estimate the- conse quence. The damages due to liquor sellers in States where prohibitory laws have been already enforced would have probably mount ed into hundreds of millions of dollars, in volving many communities and States in prospective bankruptcy ; the Prohibition party would have been given its coup cle grace, and there would have been othei im portant and far-reaching coiisequcneses. lint the Supreme Court, it apjwars, decides the other way. It says Justices Harlan de livering the opinion that a State, in the exercise of its police power, has a right to 1 suppress the liquor traffic, if it considers that tartlic subversive of public -aceor morality j and that in that case the iarties whose bust- ; ness is injured have no claim to damage or j conqiensation. This will undoubtedly rank ' in future as a notable elecisiun and prtce- i dent. j In the case of William H.

Literally Roasted Alive. WliKELl.xei, W. V., lhf. !. John llaer ty, an employe of the Wheeling Ceiniiwny's steel p!mit, met with an a.rideiit this morn ing, which, wliile Icavini; liim with a slentle-r hold ttsin life, wus of the most horrible na ture. Hagjwrty is a shear man, and stciKsl t-Kt close to a pair of mils just us a white hot icteel ingeit had been passeel between tlie-m. He wus knocked, down and the ingot, from which little rivulets of melted steel were tricking, slid across his Is sly. Huggerty was not noticed however, mid the inpit was reversed anil again asse-d through the mils, resting as licfore upon the Hsir man's body. It was then that he wus first seen, hut not until lie hud placed his naked battels against the hot metal, and attempted t push the irntit from him. When re'inoved the hones were sticking through the flesh, which was litterully fried and was hanging from him in shreds. At Ida Ml knee, where the prolmdhif; Isine come in remind with the igneit, it is burned lo a brown color. His iUmuIi is a question of but a lew hours. Another Plea for Weston. Hakkisri:ku, IV, IVo. 8. An application to the Pardon I'ounl for a rehearing in ti.e rase of Milton Weston was filiHi to day by Mayor Mcf'allin ami Colonel Uniy, of Pitts burg. The reasons given are dial the im prisonment Weston has siilli-rcd is sufficient punishment, and that al the former hearing opponents of the application gave as a rea son against pardon thai Weston shonM have been convicted of a higher grade of crime than involuntary manslaughter, whereas the finding of the jury should lie taken as conclusive on that point.
