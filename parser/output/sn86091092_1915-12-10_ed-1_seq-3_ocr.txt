The Tribune is in receipt of a copy of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Caldwell with the compliments of Judge S. Ben Dunlap. The ordinanc es were revised and codified by Judge Dunlap. They are in convenient form and indicate that Judge Dunlap de voted considerable time and work to the codification of the ordinances. It work greatly needed and well done. The code was printed bv the Caldwell News. The printing is equally well done. In fact the whole job is done in a workmanlike manner by both as to codification and print ing. Judge Robert N. Dunn returned to his home at Couer d'Alent city this week after holding a two weeks' term of court in Caldwell for Judge Bryan. Judgje Dunn is one of the best known nost popular jurists in north Ida ho. He is frequently mentioned as a probable candidate for justice of the supreme court to succeed Judge Sul livan. As he is well known over the state, and respected wherever knowp he is as strong a man as could be sug gested. His numerous friends throughout the state trust that he will be a candidate. It is estimated that the present program for the expansion of the navy, if undertaken a year ago, would have cost $40,000,000 less than the amount that will have to be expended now. It was Just a year ago that President Wilson, in his message to congress, orally delivered saidi- "But who shall tell us what sort of navv to build? Let there be no miscon ccption. The country has been misin formed. We have not been negligent of national defense." The possibili ties of preparedness as a campaign is sue had not then occurred to Mr, Wil son, and lie temporized. Verily, De mocratic procrastination is the thief of public revenues. Oregon Trail Entertainment. By marking the Old Oregon Trail, the loyal people of Idaho can most fittingly connect our historic past with the present. The construction of Arrowrock dam by the government, which has been give world-wide publicity since its completion, is a beautiful monument to the present, but the past has no monument, as yet, to its memory. v s C.J.

The Pocahontas Chapter of the D. A.

We are pleased to announce that two of our popular and talented ma trons, ^Mrs. W. J.

It is hoped that the spirit of patriotic and civic appre prication which prompts the giving of this entertainment will meet with similar response from the citizens of Caldwell. The program to be rendered by Mrs. Ross, Mrs. Scatterday and Mrs. Case is as follows: The State Press Comment If some men could lift themselves to more elevating habits of thought and speech, their power to help make the world better would be greatly in reased. Their precept and example would have a greater influence for good on the young people growing up round them.—Rathdrum Tribune. The New Freedom from time to time has called attention to the activi ties of the Republican bosses in put ting up a ticket, but it remained for the facts to leak out through The Caldwell Tribune, from which we re print an editorial in this issue.

This is the season of special edi tions of newspapers. The first com ing to the attention of The Tribune is that of the Idaho Republican, pub lished at Blackfoot by Mr. Byrd Trego. The Republican of last week was handsomely illustrated and well written. It was a credit to its pub lisher. Democratic Stamps. A stamp tax on checks has never been used in America heretofore, ex cept when the country was at war. We are for it, though, if more money is needed to replenish the pork bar rel, notwithstanding precedent. It is a very direct method of taxation, everybody knows he is being taxed, and some may like that.—Moscow Star-Mirror. Courting With One Hand. President Wilson is some courter. He can do it with one hand tied be hind him and attend to his official du ties at the same time. The Ferdinand Enterprise says: That The Caldwell Tribune and several other hide-bound partisan papers who can see no good in Jesus Christ, or anybody or anything else save the Republican party, are accus ing President Wilson of doing too much courting and neglecting his of ficial duties. If those quill smearers had as much honesty in their political carcass as is contained in an electric light meter, they would have to admit that Woodrow Wilson is capable of courting with one hand and still be able to; and has done and does more official duties than any Republican in the long presidential wind-row." Getting Us Mixed. The Tribune has great respect for the Grangeville Free Press, a leading Democratic newspaper of north Ida ho. We fear however that the Free Press may get us in bad. It is gener ally charged that The Tribune is not as partisanly Republican as it should be. The Free Press credits The Tri bune with the following which we are conviced. belongs by rfghts to our contemporary, the News: "We occasionally hear something 1 said about the savings made by Gov ernor Alexander, and he is often taunted with not having made that saving of a million dollars.

Out of respect for Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, deceased, the wedding will be a very quiet af fair. Only the immediate relatives of the happy couple will be present. Advocates Running Water. "If I were asked to name what, in my opinion, is the most desired utility of modern life, J would not name the railroad, nor the tlephonc, nor the electric light, nor the auto mobile, essential as they are, but I would name running water in the house. This conduces more to clean liness and health and comfort than any other improvement that modern civilization has brought us. It can be had, too, woith little cost. There is not a farmer of moderate means * * * who cannot with economy have running water and sewers in his home, and this would contribute more to the health and comfort of his family than any other improvement. The house fly and the mosquito are deadly enemies of our people. With running water and screens, any home, however humble, can be clean and comfortable and healthy, and the peo ple who live in it will be cleaner, more comfortable and more healthy."— Governor Locke Craig, of North Caro lina, October 19, 1915.

BOISE'S REFORM WAVE. of (Lincoln County Times.) The city of Boise, the capital Idaho, is just now experiencing great deal of undue notoriety through a reform crusade that has been start ed as a result of some revival meet ings recently held there, and the mat ter has gone so far that steps are be ing taken to recall the present mayor, on the grounds that he has shown favoritism to influential citizens of that city who have been caught in the drag-net but who were allowed to es cape on account of their prominence. Every law abiding citizen welcomes any reform movement that is carried on in a dignified and proper manner, but when professional reformers are imported to carry on the work, as has been the case in Boise, there is al ways trouble to follow. As a rule these modern so-called reformers will stop at nothing to bring about some prosecutions, and in Boise they have even gone so far as to deputize a member of one of the churches there who is blessed with a wife and daugh ter 14 years of age, to go to a certain rooming house and take up his abode for the night and with monev furnish ed by the city government to not onlv buy beer but to also purchase the downfall of a young girl doing cham bermaid work at this same rooming house. The plans were all nicely laid for the imported reformers to swoon down on the place and at the pro per time, but the plan failed and when the officers arrived, thev found their church member alone in the room. The evidence that has been intro duced in the trial of some of the pro prietors of rooming houses as report ed in the Boise papers, has been most disgusting, and indicates that there is nothing the Boise reformers will not do to bring about the ends sought. The homes of innocent persons have been raided under the plans concoct ed by the reformers, who, if the pa pers report it correctly, are more guilty than many of those brought be fore the courts. It is charged that the mayor has been responsible for much of this, and if this is a fact is it any wonder, that there should be a general demand for his recall? The so-called reform wave has stirred the city from end to end and is causing a stench that is not only disagreeable to the capital city, but its fumes extend throughout the en tire state. 

"PERK" PERKING. (Pocatello Tribune.) George W. Perkins—"Perk." as he is affectionately called bv his inti mates—is going up and down the land trying to "perk" up the Progressives and declaring that Missouri and other states will certainly put a presidential ticket in the field. Evidently Mr. Perkins does not face with equanimity the sad prospect of being a leader with no one to lead. His pronunciamen toes regarding a Progressive presi dential candidate, etc., fall rather fl..t in view of the unanimity with which the Progressives have decided to re turn to the faith of their fathers. Mis souri itself shows striking evidence of this. In 1912 Missouri gave Mr Roosevelt 124,000 votes. Last year the largest Progressive vote cast in the state was for senator. It number ed 27.000. 'President Wilson's state shows strikingly the passing of the Progressives. In 1912 that party cast 145,410 votes in New Jersey; in 1914 it cast 21,235, and in 1915 it cast 6,903. Neither can Mr. Perkins find much comfort in the showing of Iiis party in Massachusetts. In that state the Progressives cast 127,000 votes in 1913. a total of 32,000 in 1914, ami only 7, 000 in 1915. The Progressive party may put a presidential ticket in the field but it looks now as if the nominee must be George W. Perkins. the nominator George W. Perkins, and the main voter for the nominee George W. Perkins. 

WHAT IS LUXURY? (Wallace Press-Times.) An eastern newspaper recently pub lished the ideas of several people as to what their dreams of luxury were, livery one has some pet vision stored away in the back of Iiis head as to what would be the ideal thing to have or do in order to enjoy life to the ut most. These expressed ideas were as varied as the personalities back of them. A magazine editor wanted a desk eighteen feet square and ;i whole pail full iff pencils—not to mention a bar rel of green ink. He reminded one of Kipling's "They shall paint on a ten league canvas with brushes of comet's hair." One man wanted all the good music he could listen to. One man wanted silence. One wanted a yacht, one lots of books, one lots of trousers. An organized charity graduate want ed just to indulge in an orgy of reek less and extravagant giving—to set a bum up in style and watch the fun. One person was wise enough to say lie had luxury already. What he wanted was just plain, everyday com fort. Luxury, apparently, for most neople is what they haven't got. F.ven that last man wanted the luxury of being free from luxuries. The article con cludes, "Money, of course, is the basis of luxury, but there are many luxuries that money cannot buy—-the gift of appreciation is one of them." Which is very true. And all of which recalls the fact that the late Grover Cleve land said a luxury for him would be a ALPHA Gasoline Engines DISPLAYED BY THE DE LAVAL COMPANY At The Idaho State Fair ARE NOW IN STOCK AND FOR SALE WITH Idaho Implement, & Grain Co.

Neal, postoffice inspector for this district, seems to have been call ed upon the carpet for some of his re cent political activities. Inspector Daniels of Denver was in Boise this week making investigations. He had with him an article flipped from the I.ewiston Tribune detailing some of Inspector Neal's political activities in behalf of the nomination of John M. Haines for governor in 1912: his drive to secure appointment on the public utilities commission as a result of his political work; his bitter fight against Governor Haines two years later be cause of his failure to get the appoint ment he desired; and his recent move to switch Captain E. G. Davis from his candidacy for governor to that of attorney-general. Special Inspector Daniels called on a number of the prominent men of the community, es pecially those mentioned in the Tri bune article, but gave no intimation as to what his report would be. He spoke of Inspector Neal as a govern ment official in high terms and said he had recently rendered valuable ser vice to the government in running down cases in Alaska. The inspector is in Portland at this time so that his side of the case could not be secured. Inspector Daniels said that to him he acknowledged that the Tribune article was correct in all particulars. It is the impression here that some one interested has tiled charges against Inspector Neal. Who this is is not known here. It is rccaUed that Governor John T. Morris™ filed charges against him in 1912 for his .'.ctivitv in behalf of Haines that an investigation was made at that time, and that the matter was dropped later by the department. Such is the statement of "Nora Marks" Lewiston Tribune correspond ent at Boise. Pete Orcutt, editor of the Orofino Republican, should take notice and paste the same in his scrap •book beside his accumulated evidence of that "damnable political machine of President Wilson," built up through the postoffice. If President Wilson even desired to build up a so-called political machine lie would not-have to invent any new creation but would have available the old but perfect Republican model with complete working plans left by the recent Republican administration and which they are now itching to get back in power to he able to put thing in operation again.
