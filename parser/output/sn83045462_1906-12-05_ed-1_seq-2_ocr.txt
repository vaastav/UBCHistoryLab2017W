DEMOCRATS BACK OF HIM Should Aim to Push Bills Favorable to Inheritance and Income Tax. THE LAND IS BROTHEBS CALL Two of Them Are Representatives in Congress and a Third Postmaster at Porto Bica. The President received congratulations today upon his message from many congressional visitors. Among them was Representative Hinsliaw of Nebraska. "I congratulated the President on his message," said Mr. Hinshaw, "and told him that in the main I agreed with him. I do not agree with him on two problems, however. I am not in favor of ship subsidies or of currency reform at this time. I am a member of the committee that has been dealing with the ship subsidy question. In the last session of Congress no vote was ever taken on the measure In the committee because Representative Grosvenor, chairman of the committee and favorable to ship subsidies, knew that the committee was a tie and that the bill could not be reported. I do not know whether any of mc mt-'iuLH-ra ui tue cummiuee nave changed their minds. As to currency legislation, I think we have sufficient money to conduct the legitimate needs of the country. Such legislation is especially desired by Wall street speculators, who want to expand credits for speculative purposes." Democrats Back of the President. A half-dozen or more democratic senators and representatives paid their respects to the President today. Among these were Representative Underwood of Alabama. He said he believed the democrats should lose no time In trying to enact at this session of Congress the in heritance tax and Income tax views of the President. "As long as a republican President stands on a democratic platform I am with him." said Mr. Underwood. "The democrats should do everything in their power to push bills favorable to inheritance and income tax legislation. If they wait for a republican House and Senate to do It. there will never be any law dealing with these subjects." President Roosevelt's visitors today inDonfoenri+ath-ofi Pharloo flnrl Prpfl

The prominence of the Landis brothers, two of whom are In Congress and one a federal judge, has induced the friends of Walter Landis to urge him to get ready to become the first United States senator from Porto KlCO. Want an Extra Session. Representative Brick of Indiana talked briefly with the President today, but the presence of a large number of visitors prevented him making an important suggestion to the chief executive. That Is, that an extra session of Congress should be held Immediately after the regular session for the purpose of revising the tariff. Representative Brick is described as a red-hot revisionist and favorable to early actfon. Representative Crumpacker is said to be of the same opinion. Mr. Brick represents one of the largest manufacturing districts in Indiana, and his stand is explained only by the fact that he considers that there is strong revision sentiment in that state. Labor on the Isthmus. President Roosevelt had a conference today with Charles P. Nelll. commissioner of labor, and Edward A. Moffett of the Civic Federation In New York, relative to labor conditions in Panama, and especially salaries paid to trained men. Mr. MofTett has visited the Isthmus on several occasions. Many complaints have reached the President and Commissioner Nelll that wages on the isthmus are Inadequate. The President has decided to look care fully Into the complaints. In his special message to Congress on the Panama canal he will give the wages paid to workmen of all classes on the Isthmus. After this message goes to Congress he will have Commissioner NeiU and Mr. Moffett to hold conferences with the principal la&or leaders of this country and report to him as to a ?

Adams and Sawyer were convicted of taking part In the mutiny on board the schooner Henry Berwind, In which four or five persons, including the captain of the vessel, were killed. Kxtenuating circumstances were urged on behalf of Adams and Sawyer, on ttie ground that the guilt for the crime rested chiefly on a man. Scott, who was tried, convicted and hanged. The President once before refused to commute the sentence of the men, but strong pressure was brought to bear and he changed his mind.

Proposed Investments In Colombia. One direct outcome of the recent visit of Secretary Root to South America Is the dispatch to Bogota, Colombia, of Mr. W. T. S.

He will sail from N>W Tork Saturday on the Atlas line steamer. WAGE RAISE DELAYED MEN "WANT MOKE PAY AND LESS HOURS. CHICAGO, December 5.?The Tribune today says: The railways of Chicago contemplate making Increases in the wages of the employes in the immediate future, which In the aggregate will make all increases made on the railroads of the country In the re cent past seem sxnaii uy cumpanson. aa* vances are expected to be given between now and January 1 which will make the combined Incomes of the 450,000 employes of these lines from J25.000.000 to $30,000,000 greater In 1!K)7 than In 1906. The only thing that may prevent the proposed advances between now and the end of the year is inabi'ity of the railroads and their trainmen to reach an amicable agreement. The engineers, conductors, firemen, brakemen and other trainmen have asked both for 10 per cent advances and for an eight-hour day. Railway officials indicate that they are willing to give the 10 per cent Increase, but mat tney are not wining to grant tne demand for an eight-hour day, and their present disposition is to withhold the wage advance until the eight-hour day demand is withdrawn. They believe the trainmen will yield after the ground for the denial of the eight-hour day is explained to them in conference, then the wage advance will Speedily follow. Railway operating offlcia's say the reason for declining to grant an eight-hour day to trainmen is that it would either make necessary wholesale changcs in the arrangements of their divisions or heavily Increase their operating expenses in other ways. 

WITHOUT THE CIRCLE DISTRICT UNABLE TO HAVE WORK DONE AT O. P. O. A halt has been called on all the District government's printing at the government printing office, due, it is said, to a recent ruling, and the Commissioners have notified Secretary Tindall to discontiniip Rnndintr mattpp tn flip nrlntinp' r?f fice to be printed until further notice. In an act of Congress last year K wa? specified that the District government was not an executive department, and could not, therefore, be treated as such. Being so classed, the Commissioners are unable ' to receive from Congress an appropriation for printing, as Is done In the case of the various executive departments, and which was formerly done in the case of the District. However, the Commissioners will confer with the necessary committees of Congress to have the question of an appropriation for printing settled, and in the meantime the printing of _all matters for the District will be postponed. Heretofore the Commissioners have supplied the necessary paper, and have paid generously for the press work, but everything else was free of charge. But things are amerenc now. a lime worn was aone for the Commissioners several weeks ago at the public printing office and the Commissioners were much surprised when the public printer presented them with a bill for everything connected with the work. Although they were aware that they were not included in the class with the executive departments, and that no appropria-. tion had been allotted fer the printing, the Commissioners were of the opinion that th-e printer would do the work on credit until they had received some kind of an appropriation from Congress during the present session. Tho nlihtlf* nrlntor'o Hill wn o unexpected, but the Commissioners looked upon the amount as exceptionally steep, despite the guaranteed high class of the work. An official of the executive office said that the bill was much higher than would have been the case had the work been given to any ordinary job printer in the District. This cfteck on the District's printing means the delay In getting the annual reports of the various heads of departments In the District set In type. It Is estimated that the printing done by the District in the course of a year amounts to more than $15,000. 

TARIFF REVISION MOVEMENT FOB. A SPECIAL SESSION FOB THE WOBK. There la a movement afoot, backed by the Massachusetts delegation, to call upon the remibllcan members of th? Knnsa tn consider the question of tariff revision. This movement is in direct line with the sentiment in some parts of the House for a special session of Congress to consider tariff revision, taxation. Income tax and measures of this kind. Representative Butler Ames of Massachusetts, in talking with a Star reporter today, made the following statement on the subject. "For two years I have stretched myself and worked for immediate tariff revision, and I believe now is the time to revise the tariff. We should at once hold a caucus of the republicans of Congress to give a concrete expression of our determination to immediately revise the inequalities present in our tariff law, to give all possible notice to the country at large by fixing the kind of revision which should be immediately after the 4th of next March and to determine the best method of proceeding, whether under a special rule to treat only those schedules which are manifestly too high and so a burden on the country generally, or whether to open up the whole subject. "The older and consequently the more conservative republican members of Congress* are opposed to revision. This Inertia of hoary tradition, this disinclination to any change of existing conditions must be overcome by the push and energy of the | younger and more progressive members of our party. "It is characteristic of those wedded to tradition to accept without protest what is. It is equally characteristic of progress to push on with the vigor, the hope and the enthusiasm of new blood for better things. The one cries, 'Let well enough alone;' the other, "Make well enough better." While experience, age and tradition must often go hand In hand, even they admit that the tariff must be revised some time or other; but they counsel leaving It alone until pub He opinion becomes so outraged that a democratic House and Senate make the revision. The shortsighted traditionlsts admit that under the very best conditions that any revision will be accompanied by some financial unrest and suspense. They counsel not a revision by the friends of protection in the heyday of republican prosperity, when the necessary disturbance to the financial and commercial world will be least appreciable, but to recommend a postponement of action until revision Is made by the enemies of protection at a time and in a manner such as to induce the wildest fluctuation and disturbances in our prosperity and credit. "It is not good business judgment to delay the time of making needed changes or improvements in the machinery of a mill until prosperity ceases and hard times begin, nor does the thinking man wait for & thunder storm to break before patching a leak in the roof of his house, nor can it be that the lessons of the past election are to be lost or misinterpreted by the former Atanfl nut nf tha Unites " Mrs. Babcock Improving. Mrs. Babcock, wife of Representative J. W. Babcock of Wisconsin, chairman of the House District committee, is improving slowly, and, according to attending physicians, her condition is as good as 1 could be expected following such a serious operation as Mrs. Babcock underwent day before yesterday. 

PAID MOM VOTES State Manager of the Mutual Makes Startling Statement. DIRECTED TO HIRE MEN Ihey Were Wanted to Work for the Administration Ticket. AFFIDAVIT OP PACTS IS PILED Wages Came Out of Policyholders' Funds?May Be Equivalent to Grand Larceny. NEW YORK, December 5.?Though President Charles A. Peabody and other officers of the Mutual Life Insurance Company have repeatedly declared that not a dollar of the policyholders' money was beinE used In electioneering for the administration tlckst, sworn evidence to the contrary was received yesterday by Samuel Untermyer, counsel for the International policyholders' committee. This evidence was In the form of an affidavit made by Thomas C. HIndman, managing agent for the Mutual Life in Tennessee, with headquarters at Nashville. The evidence is regarded by Mr. Untermyer as conclusive. Mr. Hindman's affidavit shows that !n fourteen days he spent $1,425 of the policyholders' money paying the men he hired to solicit votes for the re-election of the Peabody ticket. The $1,42.') represented work done by twelve men from October 10 to October 29. The campaign for votes made by the Peabody management did not fully get under way until November 1. The fact that $1,425 was spent In a comparatively small state in fourteen days for salaries olnna (a ro rrd rrJ oe ln/1lnatin<v *V?r?4- Sn ??w?v vt>u>uvu uo xuutvakiiig %-uu.i mi mo forty-flve states several hundred thousand dollars belonging to the policyholders will be spent by the Peabody administration during the sixty days of the campaign. Every dollar so spent, according to the international policyholders' committee, is an illegal diversion of the company's funds and amounts to grand larceny. nr. .tunaman's Amaavit. In his affidavit Mr. Hlndman, who will probably lose his position with the Mutual Life for his admissions, states that on October 1 he was visited by D. E. Dudley, a managing agent of the company, who directed him to make liberal advances to his principal subagents and get them to canvass for votes for the administration ticket up to December 18, the final day of the election. The affidavit then says: "He Insisted that I allow to a number of my principal agents whatever commissions they should earn under their contracts. in addition to navinor to them and to such other persons as I might select straight salaries and expenses until December 18, or until Christmas If necessary. "At that Juncture he handed me a printed 'single-shot' ballot for the administration ticket only and a return gummed envelope addressed to the company, saying that a liberal supply would be forwarded to me for use in the campaign through my agents, and sure enough a day or so later I received from New York a large wooden box containing about 10,000 of them, transportation charges prepaid. "He outlined also a plan by which my agents would be expected to daily forward to my office cards indicating how the policyholders solicited by them had voted, if at all. These details were explained In my private office first to me alone and subsequently at my suggestion to my cashier and my assistant cashier and my book "On the second morning after his departure, that is, on October 3, I telegraphed him, In care of the company's office in New Orleans, that those of my agents to whom I had submitted his original proposition on" the basis of advances or loans refused to perform the services he outlined unless paid reasonable compensation in addition to being allowed their expenses." Gets Authority to Pay Salaries. Later telegrams passed between him and Vice President George T. Dexter, the executive officer In charge of the agency force, and on October 13 he was visited by Agency Supt. W. H. Wootten. The affidavit says: "After Mr. Wootten and I had thoroughly uiav^uaocu mo circumstances auendlng Mr. Dudley's visit he unequivocally authorized the plan outlined by the latter, giving me i carte blanche authority to employ agents and other persons on salary or guarantee and expenses to electioneer for votes as aforesaid until December 18, or up to Christmas If I deemed it advisable." Regarding the Instructions he received from Mr. Wootten as mandatory if he wished to retain his position, Mr. Hindman hired men with the company's funds to solicit votes for the Peabody ticket. Each man employed was given a buncne of the "single shot" (Peabody) ballots. All of the Incidental expenses of a campaign were defrayed out of the company's funds. On this point the affidavit says: Expenses Charged to Companv. "These gentlemen, as fast as they called at the office, were given Instructions by my cashier, who shipped to them by express at the company's expense single-shot administration ballots and other literature. Including stamped return gummed envelopes addressed to the company. Tue cost of those stamps and that expressage? much larger than It would otherwise* have been?was charged to the company In my regular report for last month, and it has been accepted and approved and never questioned nor disallowed.

SENATOEFULTONTALKS HIS COMMENT UPON THE RECENT CHARGES AGAINST HIM. Senator Fulton ot Oregon spoke with emphasis today to a Star reporter as to the charges made against him in a current Issue of a magazine. Coming out of the White House today Senator Fulton was asked by a Star reporter as to these charges. He said: "I suppose this was the only thing that could be resorted to that might hurt me. No charges could be secured that would result In any Indictment against me, and the consequence Is that a bunoh of lies is turned loose. This method of warfare, though, appears to be a popular one, and X under BLtiiiu is lu oe pursuea as to omer senators and representatives who have failed to bow the knee to the pure and holy patriots who find good only In themselves. Letters Were Stolen. "I am not ashamed of anything I did In relation to the Oregon appointments. One thing is to be said. I have never resorted to stealing letters or roDDing the United States mails, and I think It about time that the government authorities should make an investigation as to how letters to me should have gotten Into the possession of the author of the article. The man who Is in possession of stolen property and does not give an explanation of It stands In a very peculiar light. The letters published In the article were addressed to me htr Tnhn U T-Toll "j wuitii aa. axu.1i uiiu v/iiaii^a m: v/nirj and related to the appointment of a United States attorney. I do not remember to have ever seen the letters. "X have no recollection of having: read them before, but If they did come to me they have been stolen from my flies, as I have not been able to find them In the flies of my correspondence. If they were not stolen from my files they were stolen from the United States malls, as I do not believe the authors of the letters (rave them to anybody. "I think It Is due the public that where a man Is charged with corruption the facts upon which the charge is based should be free from dirty work. Without such freedom the charges should not receive proper weight." Interior Department Press Bureau. In connection with the appearance of attacks on Senators Warren and Clark. It Is known that some powerful Influences in the Senate, men personally and politically close to the President, have told him that they do not approve of what they call the "press bureau operating In the Interior Department" to show up the alleged uncleannena of miblic men And the IrwomintlhlB purity of some of the officials in the department. The President was told that this sort of thing was getting to be irksome to senators and representatives with reputations as clean as anybody in the executive departments. The Pr< 4 lent has Ions known of the bitter feeling against Secretary Hitchcock on the part of a number of western senators who had business with the department In connection with land matters, but he has supported Secretary Hitchcock In his in ucpcuucnt-c ui an MunLitai iiiuueilut* s ill acjilIng with affairs connected with the public lands of the country. As Secretary Hitchcock will shortly ko out of office it was supposed that there would be an end to the criticism against him and his methods, but there appears to have been a fresh outbreak which will likely not result in any change in the program that SecretaryHitchcock shall remain in his present position until the time for his retirement. 

DISMISSAL OF OFFICEBS. The President Asks Congress for Greater Power. The President today sent a special message to Congress urging legislation giving the executive authority upon hU own lnitlativA and resnonslhiHtv tn dlcmlca onv officer whom he thinks unworthy to remain In the service. The law at present provides that la time of peace no officer tfhall be dismissed except In pursuance of a court-martial or In mitigation thereof. This provision the President wants repealed. Illustrating- the necessity for the legislation desired, the President cites the case of a naval officer, whose name 1* not given, but who was accused of "Indecent and disgusting behavior." He was convicted, but the court, to his surprise, the President says, did not sentence him to dismissal. Lake Erie Dividend. NEW

Gillette, who last night was found guilty of the murder of Grace Brown at Big: Moose Lake, today received a telegram from his mother, Mrs. F. S. Gillette, of Denver, Col. The mother urged her eon to have courage niir! tnmt In fV>d. ndrtintr that she had wired to his attorneys to appeal the case. She promised that she and his father would be at Chester's side when his next trial took place. "Guilty of murder In the first degree" was the verdict of the Jury last night In the case of Chester Gillette, charged with the 1 murder of his former sweetheart, Grace Brown, at Big Moose lake, July 11. Sentence will be pronounced Thursday morning, to which time court adjourned . after the Jury had reported. Former Senator Mills. Gillette's counsel, before adjourn- I ment announced that when court reconvened at 10 o'clock Thursday he would move to have the verdict set aside. The Jury* which had deliberated for five hours, sent word at 11 o'clock that a verdict had been reached. A moment later they filed into the court room and at 11:16 o'clock an officer who had been sent for Gillette returned with the prisoner. No Sign of Emotion. Pale and a trifle nervous, apparently, Gillette faced the Jury, and when Marshal Hatch, the foreman, declared that a verdlot of guilty In the first degree had been found, the youthful prisoner gave no sign of emotion. A few moments later, when his counsel had announced his purpose of making a formal motion that the verdict be set aside, and the Judge was dismissing the Jurors, Gillette bent over a nearby table and, picking up a pencil, wrote something upon a sheet of paper. He then folded the Daner carefullv and nlaced It in his pocket. Immediately afterward he was taken from the court room back to his cell In the jail. It was learned that the Jury had some difficulty In reaching an agreement and six ballots were taken before the twelve men agreed. Up to that. time the Jury had stood eleven for conviction and one for acquittal. A Merciless Arraignment. The day's session, until the Judg-e's charge, had 'been taken up by District Attorney Ward, who described the friendship of Gillette and Grace Brown and their companionship up to the time of thel girl's death. For the first time during the trial the youthful prisoner broke down as he was mercilessly scored by the prosecutor. For some time he glared defiantly at the district attorney, but when the latter read abstracts from the letters sent v.,r u:~ *l, ^ .?i IU VIIIICllC -UJ Ills o VTvv I U1C pi ISUilCi burst Into tears, and at times throughout the remainder of the session sobbed convulsively. When the jury went to its room and Gillette was led. back to his cell he asked the deputy, "Are the doors all locked, sheriff?" Apparently he feared violence, but there was no evidence of any intention of violence on the part of the big crowd that swarmed the courtroom. After supper the courtroom filled quickly and many remained long, hoping to witness the return of the jury. The Judge's Charge. In his charge Judge Devendorf said: "To all concerned this Is a case of great Importance. You have no right to be influenced or controlled by anything but the evidence as it has been presented to you and the law governing: It as given to you by the court. Tou have no right to permit either sympathy or favor with one or the other party to sway your Judgment. "None of us was present on the 11th of July, when It is said this crime occurred. The evidence that Grace Brown lost her life at Big Moose lake admits of no doubt, i But there is no testimony on the part of the people as to an eyewitness, as to what occurred at the fatal moment, other than the defendant, to detail the last scene in the alleged tragedy. But all evidence Is more or less circumstantial, whether consisting of factB which permit the inference of the guilt or whether given by an eyewitness. "Gentlemen, evidence is not to be discredited or decried because It is clrcumotnntlol T# mntr rtffan Via mrwi?A rnl In 1.1a oiaiiiiaii xi ma.j uiicii uo uivi o evidence than direct evidence. "Something has been said with reference to the motive. Proof of motive of crime Is not indispensable or essential to conviction. While a motive may be shown as a circumstance to aid In fixing a crime, yet the people are not required, to prove a motive. Motive Bests With Jury. "The motive In this case Is said by the people to be because of the relations that existed between this man and this girl. Now, whether the situation in which he irafl fnrniQhe/1 a mnflra for him to commit this crime rests with the Jury to say. "X say to you, gentlemen, that I know of no law?In fact, there Is no law?that requires that a defendant should be present at the autopsy or that he should be represented. He has no particular right to be present; In fact, he cannot be expected to be a witness. This Is not an Issue In the case and Is not to be considered. "It was further said by one of the counsel that If every graft In Herkimer oounty could be investigated, the first thing he would Investigate in that regard would be that of the physicians. If there is any graft going on in Herkimer county that should be presented to the court In proper time and in the proper place. Undoubtedly, the physicians called would be paid by the county for their service* the same as all the other officials, the same as the defendant's counsel." The Judge then touched on the question oi me crime ana uuer saiu: "If the Jury finds that Grace Brown Jumped overboard voluntarily and that the defendant made no attempt to rescue her, that does not make him guilty." Ridiculed Defense. In his argument District Attorney Ward ridiculed the argument of State Senator VYOla* r\f <?nitneAl frti* tha ^ufanoa "Mr. Mills," he said, "made statements to you yesterday that were most helpful to his client, but, remember, he was not under oath. ' The defense," continued Mr. Ward, "said there was a physician at the Qlenmore who had seen Grace Brown's body and that the Jury would bare the benefit of his attendance. "I>ld you? He was here In Herkimer, but not In court. WhyT It was Just another of the counsel's sly moves." The district attorney described Gillette's life In Cortland as outwardly correct, but actually culpable, a* shown by the wrong he had admitted he had done Grace Brown. Gillette, Ward sold. "wanted to stay In Cortland In aociety. He never intended? never for a moment?to take Grace Brown anywhere except to her death. He concocted a plan to rid hlmaelf of her?*, crime far less than his first to rob her of virtue. The girl received her death blow, I am sura, with a grateful heart out there In the woods." Passages from Miss Brown's letters were read, showing that she chafed under neglect. Mr. Ward said: "Had he promised to marry her? He ? had to. or she would have shouted his Infnmv to the winds tn Cortland, for under lier beauty she was a true American, standing on her rights. Cruel Blow in Letter. "He did not strike Grace Brown anymore cruel blows on Big Moose lake than he did In this letter," said Mr. Ward, as he read one missive In which Gillette told tha girl not to be discouraged, "to have a go.,a time, to go away with her parents and not to worry.' . "The cool, clever, courageous scoundrel." me iiruwcuar aeciared. ?aid on the nt,ind that he asked Grace Brown to go with him I on Decoration day. He lied. Me was olt with a ?lrl to Skaneateles lake that day. A man can be drilled into a long story to cover guilt, but the lie will come out." Mr. Ward described Utllette as an unmitigated liar. v "His counsel says the prosecuting lawyers are liars, the witnesses are liar*, the doctors are liars?all liars, except that augel of a boy." Reading the letter In which Grace Brown aaid: "I said 'No' so many times, but the world will never know It," Mr Ward s.tld: "The world does know It, little girl, even If you had to sacrifice your life beneath the fangs of this monster to let tile world tind It out. There was never an impure thought | In this girl * mind. She Was Innocent ih? , uay sne <lled as wlien she was born." The trouble taken by Gillette to conceal I his identity when he wan away with Grac? Brown was commented upon by the district attorney. Gillette Shed Tears. I While Mr. Ward was denouncing Gillette. the youthful prisoner broke Into tears. Mr. Ward said the correspondence Of Gillette and Miss Brown revealed four tilings?that h? 1"nr.' - " ? _ _ iivt IU jcave coriland, so her condition would not become known there; that he promised he would > come for her and take her away to a distant point to marry her; that she must keep secret the fact that Chester Gillette was going away with her, and that she expected to go away and keep house. "They tell you," said Mr. Ward to the jury, "that he carried his tennis racquet to give an impression he was on a vaca uon. But the balls were In the?euit ease, anil he planned to have a good time on Seventh lake and Ingratiate himself with those girls. It is necessary for a liar to have a long memory. ThinK of those two tennis balls convicting him of that lie." Mr. Ward said that Gillette "swore Grao# Brown was the only girl he ever loved. She cried, 'I am all alone; don't you wish you were all alone?' That cry would hava brought a real man 600 miles; but that rat disappeared at the lake with another sweetheart. She tried hard to please him, and he tried hard to seal her lips forever. "Her spunk caused her death?caused him to stun her on shore with a blow, and put her in the lake. She wrote; 'I will come on Saturday.' and the spunk in this sealed her fate. He knew she would come.'* Gillette's testimony on the witness stand was denounced as a Carefully rehearsed tissue of ffllsphnrtds Tlift tilor, vtll Grace Brown had been deliberately thought out and the water chosen because of the defendant's skill as a swimmer and boatman. ? Third Course Murder. "Gillette," said District Attorney Ward after the noon recess, "had three courses open to him. One was to leave Cortland and the girl, to open the doors of the poorhouse for her; but to do this he would have to leave his pleasures and go back to the railroads. He did not want to. Another was to marry her?to become an hnnOot trArlfln?rmon onH n rsvrwt huoKM?/l?

What course did he mean to take when he urged secrecy and kept silent as to his plans? He meant to tnke the course he did take?seal the lips of the girl forever. "He knew If she died In a strange way. If she disappeared, the authorities of Cortland county would call on Chester Gillette to learn how. when and why. He thought he could fool people, could make a straw man, leave that girl with an unknown man on the lake, that people would say tliey could not find nis Doay, and inai ner j'aients would hush up their disgrace for the sake of her sisters." AlthouKh he had registered under fictitious names prior to tha death of Gracs BrBown, once Miss Brown was dead, counsel said, Gillette lost no time In resuming .< his own name, under whloti he registered at Arrowhead, and the same day he carved 1 his Initials and the date upon a rook.
