SIAXS 2 is Alabama.—T nere is nothing to disturb the relations of confi dence and good will between Alabama and her sister States, and she baa bo controver sy with the tFeaeral Government. On the contrary, the people and the State goverc mect are in earnest accord In support of every measure that tends to promote the welfare of the entire people of the Union ? and to maintain the honor and credit of the genera! government. Within our borders there is no lack of the means ot comforta ble subsistence, and in many respects we are blessed with abundance; peace and con tentment prevail, and a new and growing prosperity strengthens the hopes of the people and gives them courage in their efforts to utilize all the rich and bountlfu. resources with which nature has endowed this beautiful land.—[Governor Cobb's IB augural Add r ess. Ix the bihob which comes from Wash ington that the Republican *>d Democratic managers have becom* so fearful of each other that political investigations are likely to be stoppied, by mutual content, be true, it will be regarded as a confession of fraud by each, that ia likely to deepen the con tempt which reflecting persons are hardly able to conceal for popular government.

No honorable man can with complacency contemplate the proceedings by which, a-tively on the part of one party, and per tniseively by the other, fraud was seated in the highest office in the country. But that is history which cannot be affected by in vesUgation. •• The only question that is ncdacided is the guilt or innoeenee of Hayes or Tilden, and that is of vital interest to the whole people. If Mr. Hayes rewarded ballot sniff ers and forgers ef returns with positions of honor sed profit, knowing their guilt he 1* as guilty as the worst of the criminals who made his false return: snd If Tilden ecu ceived, participated in, or assented to the frauds In Oregon and the South, he is as guilty as the guiltiest of the Hayes elecoral thieves.''
