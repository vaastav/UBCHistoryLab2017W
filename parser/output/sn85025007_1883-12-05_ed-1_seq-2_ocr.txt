ALEXANDRIA, YA. WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC KM HER A mono' TDK bills introduced in the Senate yesterday was one providing fur the re moval of nil disabilities imposed by the Mtli amendment to the Constitution. The disa bilities referred to prevent those who hav ing previously taken an oath as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of a State legislature, to support the Constitution, and afterwards t ><>k the part of the South in the civil war. from holding any ollice, civil or military, under either a State or the national govern ment-. There are but few men subject to these disabilities now, and us t he experience of the world shows that the obliteration of the memories of civil wars is wise policy, it is hoped that the bill alluded to may be passed us soon as practicable, so that the statutes pussid under the amendment may be swept away, and not be allow ed to stand, as Senator Edmunds de sire-, to -how "which si<h' was right/1 The exbo-s of Virginia, unless a change has come over the spirit of his dreams since the lust Congress, will vote against it, but his colleague can hardly do so. and there are supposed to be enough liberal minded and patriotic republican Senators whose votes with those of the democrat4 will be sufficient to carry the bill through, lint whether successful or not the attempt should be marie, and should t>< u rgei I euerget i ca 11 v.

Ins statement referred to is more indicative of his prejudice than of his sincerity. Thk Pkksiwsnt, in his message, says, that in a communication he sent to the last t 011 m'ess he recommended that, all excise taxes he abolished except those on whiskey, and that substantial reductions bo made in the revenues from customs, and that helms now no doubt th at still further reductions in both those means of raising revenue may be wisely made. Now the President is Un representative of the republican party, and if he talks in this revenue reform style, what reasonable grounds of complaint can his party have against the majority of the democrats in the IT. S. House of Represen tatives, who have just eleeled as their Speaker a man who talks in precisely the same style? The <;kani> .irttv of Danville, which city has a Mahonc judge and Mahone court olli eers who draw the grand juries, have agreed with the committee of forty, with tho news papers of that city, and with the deniociatic State committee, in ti tiding that the icccnt riot there, instead of being a premeditated a I lair, as tho Mahoneites say, occurred without the slightest premonition ; that if was brought on by the negroes, and that but for the stand taken by the white people the lives of hundreds would have been sac rificed. This finding the ex-boss's morning Washington organ terms "brazen moral idiocy and unutterable mendacity." But the ex-boss and his organs would call while black to serve their ends. Ex Gov. Lewis, ia a recent letter to a friend, says: "Mv advice has no weight with the rulers of the Keadjustei* party. My friends have been slaughtered right and left, and I some times think the Moss is trying to provoke me to leave the party, but as plunder, nor self agciamlizemcut, was no part of my aim when 1 helped to form the party, I tlo not mean to leave until it suits me, and I never mean to be kicked out by auy ring, some of whom came into ihe Coalition, after suc cess was assured." This corresponds with what Mr. Lewis told some of his friends in Washington last Monday, as reported in the Gazette's cor respondence from that city of yesterday's d ate. The PkEsiuknt, in his annual message, j seut to Congress yesterday, says : " I his j Government remaius firm in its conviction j that, the rights of its citizens should be in 110 wise affected by their religious belief." ; And yot. in another part of the same nies- ] sa<ie, in reference to the Mormon citizens of j the country, he recommends the suppression j of their territorial government, and that. a| commission appointed by Congress take control of them. The President must be a disciple of ex-Commissioner llaum of the i internal revenue bureau, who saysamodern politician can't atl'ord to be consistent. Judge Charles E. Stuakt, of this city, has been chosen Speaker of the House of: Delegates, aud bis fellow citizens will rejoice at the honor thus conferred upon him. Judge Stuart, though comparatively a I young man, has had parliamentary experi | euro, is possessed of ability, has good judg i meat and quick perception and will, we ! have no doubt, make an excellent presiding ? ollicer, acceptable to all the members of tlie ! lloii-e. He h to be congratulated upon his i elevation. The 1'itresident has given further evi dence ofhis intention of being for Mahone because Mahone is for him, by using the privileges of his annual message as a means for raising a boom for the ex-boss's Florida canal scheme. But the effort of Mr. Arthur to help Mahone's canal will be just as vain as will bo thai ofMahone to give Mr. Ar thur the vote of Virginia in the next na tional republican convention.

The ;ir?i>Hcants for tho otliccs at the (lis posal of the United States House oi" Rep resentatives are increasing as the delay in the <li.Ht ribution of those offices is prolonged. It has been stated iu this correspondence that the number was twenty for each office. ll is said this morning that instead of tweuty the number is one thousand. The offices will be apportioned?that is, it is said they will be?according to the ratio of democratic representatives the States respectively have hi the J louse, so that only a small number crimes to any one State,and for that the mem bers are harassed almost to death. It was the , intention to retain several of the more efficient republican employees iu addition to the old soldiers. Inil the pressure for their places will probably bo too great for their friends to overcome. . . As regards the Senate's officers, it is said this inoVning that some of the democratic Senators have la-en informed by their re publican colleagues that no changes will be made lt>r some time at least. The reason oi' ihi-, il e> understood, is that after tho President pro tempore, the next officer to b<- c lee led' is the Secretary, and that the republicans are aware that the attempt to elect .Mr. (lothaul, their favorite for the place, will be opposed by the democrats, probably, wh >n reduced 10 an extremity, i?y dilalin v measures, and that they don t want to bring on a .-tpiabble, at least sosoon in t he so-sion, and lor so small a cause, and one that euunot well be defended. In tin; Senate to-day there was another Hood of bills, the large majority of which will never be lieard of again. Key. l>r.

Objection to Mr. Mayo's right to be sworn in should have been made before he look the oath, ll was too late to object to-day or vesterday, and was so said to be by democrats as well as republicans. There are so many democrats in the House that they not only (ill all the seats on their side of the chamber, but run over and occupy about thirty seats on the repub lican side. In the drawing for seats yester day Mr. Harbour got a very good oue, on his side, but ween ex-Senator Eaton aud Mr. i'attoii, of Pennsylvania. The live Mahone ites from Virginia set on the republican side. There is but one negro in the House, O'llara, from North Carolina, a light mu latto, and his desk, also on the republican side, is adorned each day with a beautiful bouquet. There are two ex-Senators in the House, Messrs Eaton, of Connecticut and Kellogg, of Louisiana, bul they are of lefs account t han many of their colleagues. The House adjourned before one o'clock to-day, having previously adopted a resolution to adjourn to-morrow until Monday. The general impression about the Presi dent's message is that it. is a plain statement of the allairs of the country, which was pre pared no better than could have been done by any clerk in the executive department. < >uito :i party of Warrcnton democrats were here last night on their way to Rich mond to do what, they could to help Mr. Sheppard in his contest for tho position of Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The election of Judge Stuart, of Alexan dria, to the Speakership of the Virginia House of Delegates is thought by Virginia democrats here to be an excellent thing for the party as well as for the State. They think the Judge is one of the rising young democrats of the State, and that he is des tined to make his mark in national politics.

VIRGINIA'S CONTESTED ELECTION. In the House of Representatives yester day after a further recess until three o'clock Mr. Tucker, idem.) of Virginia, offered a resolution referring to the Committee on Elections, when appointed, the certificates and all other papers relating to the election of the Representative from the First dis trict of Virginia, with instructions to report at as early a day as practicable, which of the rival claimants 'Mr. Mayo and Mr. Gar rison) to the seat has the prima facie right thereto reserving to the other party the privilege of contest ing the case on its merits. The President's secretary at live minutes past three appeared and presented the President's Message. The consideration of Mr. Tucker's resolu tion was then entered upon. Mr. Calkins, (rep.) of Ind., conteuded that the prima facie right had already been set tled by the swearing in ofMr. Mayo. Tho previous question having been seconded, Mr. Iveifer, of Ohio, spoke in opposition to the resolution, contend ing that, should it he adopted and Mr. Har rison allowed his prima facie right to the seat, Mr. Mayo would be deprived of all power of contest. This was a plan by which a man already sworn in could be unseated on a prima facie case and forever deprived of the right of contest, and the House should hesitate before it undertook to put any gen tleman in that position. Mr. John S. Wise, (Malioneite) of Va., asked his colleague whether there was any question as to who has the prima facia title to the seat. Mr. Tucker?I will answer my colleague ?yes. Mr. Springer, of Illinois, said that he un derstood that Mr. Garrison had made a con test as to the prima facie right to the seat as well as to his right on its merits. I'nder the constitution the House was the judge of the election of its members, but it was necessary, in the first instance, to give to some other power the granting of certifi cates. Now that the House was organized it was judge of everything which pertained to the right of a member. It was gettiugto be too common for returning boards, in the States indiscriminately to t hrow out whole counties (as was done iu this case) in order to accomplish a partisan purpose. The House could not be stopped from inquiring into the legallity of this proceeding as well as into the merits of the case finally. Would the House allow a returning board to usurp the authority of the House and disfran chise whole communities in the granting of prima facie, certificates? If there ever bad been an arbitrary exercise of a quasi judi cial power by a returning board it was iu this ease. Mr. J. S. Wise said that the assumptions made by the last speaker were based on facts which were not in the record, and his conclusions reached to the point ofdeeiding h case before trial. The only case from Vir ginia in which the question of returning boards was raised was in the case of Piatt against Goode, when Piatt was elected, but Ooode piven a seat by a democratic House. It therefore came with a bad grace from tlie other side to make a statement that the frauds of returning boards were becoming too common in Virginia. Mr. Mayo, (Malioneite) of Va., declared that, the certificate which allowed him to he sworn in was identical with that, presented by his colleague (Mr. Tucker.) He asked in common justice thai, the House shouM deal with his case fairly. squarely and justly for he should be sorry to have to say thai lie belonged to a body of men whoso far forgot what was right as to decide upon a case in advance merely because be belonged to the minority. Mr. Calkins appealed to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tucker) not to establish a precedent which would endanger every man in his seat. After the t'lerk of the House had put a man on the roll and he was sworn in the prima facie right was re? <iiljiiilicuhi. On the suggestion of Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, the matter was allowed to go over until lo-dav. 

PROCEEDINGS OF CONT.KESST0 DAW BEN AT K. The Senate was called lo order at noon. Arter prayer by the Chaplain and the read were presented and referred to the appro priate committees when appointed, awl a number of bills were introduced and appro priately disposed of. HOUSE. Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, called up (he resolution ottered by him yesterday refer ring to the Committee on Elections the papers in the Virginia contested election easo of Garrison vs. Mayo, with instruct ions to that committee lo decide upon the prima fticir right to the seat without prejudice to the linal decision on the merits. In support of his resolution Mr. Tucker said that all preliminary proceedings of the swearing in of members under the law of Congress de pended on the regularity of the certificates presented by each member. It was some thing preliminary to organization. But when the members were sworn in. the House was organized, and for the first time, was actiug under the Constitution, which gave it the right to judge of the elec tion of its own members. The democratic party would do justice in these coutested election cases, and his action was not prompted by any desire to do injustice to Mr. Mayo. Mr. Buckner, o( Missouri, offered a reso lution referring Mr. Tucker's resolution to the Committee on Elections when appoint ed, with instructions to report on the legal question involved therein. Adopted. On motion of Mr. Randall, of J'enna., it was ordered that when the House adjourn to-morrow it be to meet on Monday next. Mr. Jones, of Alabama, submitted the customary resolutions announcing the death of Thomas II. Herudou, of Alabama, and out of respect to the memory of the deceas ed the House, at 1 ?.-JO, adjourned with the? understanding that no business will be transacted to-morrow. VIRGINIA NEWS.

General Hill lost an arm in the war, Mr. Sullivan a leg, and Mr. Cottrell an arm. The Mahoneites met in the Senate cham ber, hut their caucus was a failure, being slimlv attended, leading men of the party being conspicuously absent. It is under stood that one feature of t heir programme will be to anticipate the Democrats in the introduction of popular measures, which they w ill claim as coalition measures. The caucus nominated Mr. K. F. Banks, of Nor folk, for speaker of the House, and I*. If. McCaull, for clerk. V J IIG I XIA 1.Eli1SLATI"KP.. (S|'<-ci:il His,mltl. to tIn* Ai.rxAN'uui \ Uazkttk.) Richmond, \'a , Dec. ?The Legislature assembled to-day at 12 o'clock noon. In the Senate Lieut Gov. John F. Lewis, presided. The House was called to order by P. If. MeC'aul, the old clerk. The ollicers nominated by the democratic can cusses last niglit were elected in both bodies. taking the appointment of the.standing com mit tees out of the bauds of the. president and giving them to that body. \\ hen Mr. John L. Hurl,one of thedemo cratic Senators from Pittsylvania offered to qualify, Grim, Malioneile, from Page, opposed it, and offered the evidence in the con tested election case of William K. Sims, the Mahoneitc claimant, as the reason why he should not be permitted to do so. Presi dent Lewis decided that Hurt had the cer tificate, and that he had no right to prevent him from qualifying, whereupon Mr. Hurt qualified. There were L\"? democratic Sena tors who answered to the roll call and ten coalitionists. There were three absent Senators on the coalition side, and four vacancies in the House to-day. Horsford Anderson, Malioneile member, from King William, voted for Stuart, the democratic nominee for Speaker. i he House elected all of the democratic officers who served at the session of 1S77-S.

GOVERNOR'S M ESS AGE. (Sjx-rial ili*|>:itcli to tin; Alcxnu ?lriii[C?AZKTTE.) Richmond, December 5-3 p. in.?The Governor's message was sent to the two branches of the General Assembly late this afternoon. Tn iL the Governor points out the defects in the Kiddleberger acts in reference to the State debt, and suggests certain remedies, which he believes will make that settle ment of tho debt practical and save tho troubles likely to occur under the present, law. The Governor also calls attention to (he manner in which the public funds arc dis tributed, and suggests that the Legislature should give the Executive con tr ol over these matters so as to prevent any loss to the State by a failure of the banks in which such deposits are kept. The Governor says that all of the public institutions of the State have been well conducted duringthe past two years,and calls attention to the oyster interest and the in justice done by the boundary liue establish ed between this State and Maryland. The Governor says he will send in anot her message on the same subject, in which he will ask for more scope and money to protect the oyster interests of this State. After drawing a picture of the prosperity of the people of this State, Gov. Cameron in his message, refers to the Danville affair of Nov. od, to which he calls attention, with out any desire to be partisan, hut says the fact that several persons were killed there,at that time, and for the good name of the Commonwealth as well as to punish the of fenders, the affair should be investigated. He has very little to say on the subject and what he does is intended to appear conser vative. He calls attention to the railroad combi nations and asks the Legislature to cease the trouble by proper legislation. The message throughout seems to he un usually calm and dispassionate. Both houses adjovrned at 12 p. m. G EX. MA HONE REQUESTED TO RE SIGN. [Special to the Gazkttb.! Richmond, Dee. 5.?Mr. Thurman, of Bedford, democrat, offered a joint resolu tion in the Senate t his afternoon requesting Senator Mahone to resign his seat in the Senate, as he has grossly misrepresented the people of the Stale, and has heeu con demncd by the vote at the last election. 'J'he resolution lies over under the rules. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. In addition to the brief synopsis given in yesterday's GAzette, the President in his message stajes that peaceful relations exist with all foreign nations, but at the same time he recommends in case of war with any foreign power, that immediate steps he taken for the creation of an interior coast line of water ways across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampiou Roads, between the Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river, and through Cape Cod. Commercial treaties have been made with Servia, Roumania, Corea and Madagascar; legations have been establish ed in "Persia, Corea and Siam, and it is re commended that the interests of American citizens resident or trading in Bulgaria and the Central American States be eared for by the presence of consular representatives ol the United Slates. Reference is made to the Brazilian export duty on cotlee, and to the penalties for technical faults applied to American vessels and cargoes in the Antilles and the suggestion is made that retaliatory measures applied Lo Spanish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto liico might not be barren of good results. Attention is called to the work of the International African Association in the Congo valley, and Congress is reminded that iL may be come advisable Ibr us to co-operate with other commercial powers iu promoting the rights of trade in that region "free from tbe interference or political contiol of any one nation.*' No large reduction of revenues i* advised. Congress is reminded that a tarill' hill has been recently passed, the results of which are not yet sufficiently apparent to warrant a further modification til the tarill or internal revenue laws. He states, how ever, lhut the legislation referred to has cut down lhe income of the government some fi 1*1 v or sixty millionsof dollars. The surplus ol revenue over expenditure, which the I'resident estimates aL ?00,01 it), it is re commended should be spent in rehabilitat ing the navy and providing coast defenses. The suggestion of the Secretary of the Treasury as Lo the proper method of per petuating the national bank system is ap proved. It. is accordingly recommended that the tax of 1 per cent, on the circulation of the unliotuil banks be repealed, and that the amount of the circulation allowed on bonds deposited for security be increased to ? in per cent, on the market value of such bonds. With respect to the disposition to he made of trade dollars, the President recommends that the trade dollar be ac cepted by the treasury and the mints as bullion at a small percentage above the cur rent market price of silver of like fineness. Approval is given the Secretary of the Treasury's plan for the consolidation of certain customs districts, and it is added i>v the reduction of' m*?rnal revenue districts, recently perfected, their number number has been reduced from I'Jt! to So. The President urges the reconstruction of the navy aud the building of plant for the manufacture of heavy ordnance, and points to the overflowing condition of the treasury as a fact that renders the present the proper time for the inception of so great ? work. Attention is called to the growth of the of postolliees from l(!,23I in 1S82 to in 

ISS-'J. The recommendation is made that the rate of postage on drop let ters, which at present is two cents where the carrier system is established and one cent elsewhere, be made uniform by reduc ing it everywhere to one cent. Reference is made lo the long-mooted proposition that the government should assume the same control over the telegraph that it has always exercised over the mail, but the President is unable to accord his approval to the project. It is suggested that the govern ment should be authorized to exercise some sort of supervision over interstate tele graphic communication. Congress is invited to consider the impor tant question whether Federal aid may not with propriety be extended to public pri mary education in parts of the country where the percentage of illiteracy is high. The failure of the anti-polygamy legislation of March, 1SS2, iseited, and the recommenda lion is made that Congress repeal the act upon which the existing government of Utah depends, assume control of the Terri tory, and establish in authority a commis sioil with powers lining it to deal effective ly with tiie Mormon problem. The ques tion of regulating interstate commerce is presented for consideration. The right of railway corporations to reasonable profits is conceded, but Congress should protect the people from injustice. The effects of the civil-rights act in the short time during which it has been in operation are pro nounced beneficial. The act passed by the Senate at its Inst session regulating the pres idential succession is recommended to the favorable consideration of the present Con gress. 11 is asked t hat the Executive be em powered to veto particular items of an ap propriation without impairing the validity of other items which meet his approval. The President calls attention to the re peal of the French statutes which forbade the importation into that country of Amer ican pork products, and notes the refusal of the German government to investigate the matter.
