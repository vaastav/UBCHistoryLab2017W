PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Cleveland Believes That Tariff Re form Should be Pushed. HEARTILY INDORSES THE WILSON BILL The "Work of Departments Reviewed A Message lroini"l on the Hawaiian Ouestion. Washington, De. 4. Following ia President Cleveland's message read to both houses of congress: To the Congress of the United States: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their considera tion such legislation as he shall judge necessary, is fittingly entered upon by copftmending. to the confess a careful commendation of the detailed statements and well supported recommendations con tained in the reports of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive tfcork of the government. In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is'conslstent with its purpose, I shall sup plement a brief reference with the con tents of these departmental reports by the mention of such executive business and incidents as are' not embraced therein, and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. 

DEPARTMENT OF 8TATE. Our Foreign Relations. While our foreign relations have not at all tltaea during the past year been en tirely free from perplexity, no embarrass ing situations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice which, joined with consistent firmness, characterizes a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor having accepted the of fice of arbitrator of the Ions standing missions boundary dispute, tendered to the president by the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has beeu my agreeable duty to ' receive the special envoys commissioned by these states to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their respec tive governments. The outbreak of do mestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United States alert to watch the interests of oar citizens in that coun try, with Which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now, and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The struggle being between the established government, which controls the machinery of administration and with which we main tain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief sea port and lacking as it does the elements of divided adminis tration, I have failed to see that the in surgents can reasonably claim recognition as belligerents. Thus the position of our Government has been that of an attentive ut impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impartial neutrality in such a condition Of affairs as now exists I deemed it neces sary to disavow in a manner not to be misunderstood, the unauthorized action Of our late naval commander in those waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian admiral, being indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanc tion to the local insurrection. The vexatious question of so-called le gation asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chile by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving in his official residence two persons who had failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pend ing, growing out of a former abortive dis turbance. '1 he doctrine of asylum as ap plied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedent, and when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and strife. Unier no circumstances can the representatives of this government be permitted under the ill-defined fiction of extraterritoriality to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in""the countries to which they are accredited. A temperate demand having been made by the Chilean government fur the correction of this conduct, the minis ter was instructed no longer to harbor offenders. Chinese Registration. The legislation of last year known as the Geary law, requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to resi dence in the United States, and the de portation of all not complying with the provision of the act within the time pre scribed, met with much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon - the advice of eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional, the great mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its validity, in good" faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its E revisions. A test upon proceedings by abeas corpus was brought before the su preme court, and on May 15, 1893, a de cision was made by that tribunal sustain ing the law. It is believed that uuder the recent amendment of the act extending the time for registration, the Chinese la borers thereto entitled who desire to re side in this country, will now avail them selves of the renewed privilege thus af forded of establishing by lawful pro cedure their right to remain, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deporta tion may to a great degree be avoided. The Anialapa Incident. Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Amalapa because her captain refused to deliver up a passenger in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, ur minister to that country, under instructions, pro tested against the wanton act and de manded satisfaction. The government of Honduras, actuatod by a sense of justice and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly diaavowed the illegal conduct of its othcers and expressed sincere regret for the occurrence. The reproduced caravel, Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian exposition, has been presented to the United States in token of amity and in oommamoration of the event ic was de signed to celebrate. I recommend, that in accepting this gift, congress make grate ful recognition of the sincere friendship whioh prompted it. Important matters have demanded attention in our relations with the Ottoman porte. The firing and partial destruction, by an unrestrained mob, of one of the school buildings of Anatoly college, established by citizens of the United States at Marso van, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, not withstanding the complicity of some of its officials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was followed by promises of repara tion and punishment of .the offenders. In demnity for the injury and permission to rebuild was given, registration of the school property in the name of the Amer ican owners was seettred, and efficient pro tion guaranteed. Information received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive American woman engaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordictan was followed by such representations to the porto as resulted in the Issuance of orders ior the punishment of her assailants, the removal of a delin qaent official, and the adoption of meas ures for the protection of our citizens en gaged in mteioa and other iawful work in that quarter. The Hawaiian Question. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our gela tions with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just Drior to the installa tion of the present administration the ex isting government of Hawaii had been sua denlv overthrown and a treatv of annexa tion cad been negotiated between the pro visional government of the islands and the United States and submitted to the senate for notification. This treaty I withdrew f or examination and dispatched Hon. James H. Biount of Georgia to Honolulu- as a ; special commissioner to make an impar tial investigation of the circumstances at tending the change of government and of all the conditions bepring -upon the sub ject, of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examination, Mr. Blouiit sub mitted to ms his report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional gov ernment of Hawaii had Dsen subverted with the active aid of oar representative to that fcove rnmenfc and through the in timidation caused by the presence of au S2S3 pavaj force of the United States. Which was landed for thSt purpos at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed, it seemed to me the only hon orable course for our government to pur sue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to re store as far as practicable the status exist ing at the time of our forcible interven tion. With a view of accomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing but of any changed condition brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has re ceived appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no information of the ac complishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional ad vices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to congress, to gether with all other information at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and present a history of all of the material events leading up to the present situation. 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Condition of National Finances. The secretary of the treasury report that the receipts of the government fiom all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, amounted to fct51,716,5ei.94, and its expenditures to $459,374,674 29. There was collected from customs 1205, 355,016.73, and from internal revenue f 161, 027,623.93. Our dutiable imports amounted to 1421,856,711, an increase of (52, 453,907 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $444,544,211, a de crease from the preceding year of $13,455, 447. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $7,147,445.32. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $847,665,194, a decrease of $182,612,954 from the preceding year. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting to $108,680,844, and exceeding the amount exported dur ing the preceding year by $58,485,517. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was $9,875,130.88, an increase over the preceding year of $2,033,053.09. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the gov ernment for the year ending June 30, 1894, will be $430,121,365.38, and its expendi tures. $458,121,365.38, resulting in a de ficiency of $28,000,000. On the first day of November 1803, the amount of money of all kinds in circulation or not included in treasury holdings was $1,718,544,682, an increase 'for the year of $112,404,947. Esti mating our population at G?,426,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273, and silver bulliou, which was purchased at a cost of $123,261,553. Silver Fnrchases. The purchases of silver undr the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, aggreeated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces which cost $45,531,374.83. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the first day of November 1893, was 163,674,590.46 fine ounces which cost $155, 930,940.84. Between the first day of March 1873, and the first day of November, 1893, the gov ernment purchased under all laws. 503, 003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of $516,622,948. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July, 14, 1890, number 36,087,285. The seignorage arising from such coinage was $6,977,093.39, leaving on hand in the mints 140,699,760 fine ounces of silver which cost $126,578,218. Our total coinage of all metals during the last fiscal year consisted of 97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was $30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,343, 715 in silver dollars, $7,217,220.90 in sub sidiary silver coin and $1,086,102.90 in minor coins. During the calendar year 1892 the production oi precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1,596,375 fine ounces of gold of the com mercial and coinage value of $33,000,000, and 58,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $59,750,000 and of the coinage value of $74,989,900. It is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion,- amounted to - $1,213,559,161, of which $597,697,685 was gold and $615,861, 484 was silver. National Banks. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year end ing Oct. 31, 1893, with a capital of $11,230, 000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquid ation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, 86 re sumed business and 7 remained in the hands of bank examiners with prospects of speedy resumption. The total number of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October, 1893, was 3,796, having an aggregate capital of $695,558,120. The net increase in the circu lation of these banks during the year was $36,886,972. The recent repeal of the pro vision of the law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the government as a feature of our monetary scheme, has made an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that th ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far-reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this time precisely what condi tions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any. supplementary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, ap pear to be essential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial perturba tion, time is necessary for tha-re-establish-ment of business confidence. When, how ever, through this restored confidence, the money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and business. In pursuit of this object we should reso lutely turn away from alluring and tem porary expedients, determinedT to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this s ab ject instead of being injurious will in crease the probability of wise action. Monetary Conforence. The monetary conference which assem bled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to the 20th day of November in the present year, for the considerations just s tat ad and the fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to be expected upon the reassembling of the conference, led me to express a will ingness to have the meeting still further postponed, it seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the president to invite other nations to such a conference at any time when there should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an international agreement on the subject of coinage. 1 desire also to earnestly sug gest the wisdom of amending the existing statutes in regard to the issuance of gov ernment bonds. The authority now vested in the secre tary of the treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as it should be and the bonds authorized are disadvantageous to the gov ernment, both as to th i time oi their ma turity and rate of interest. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, re ports that during the List fiscal year there arrived at our ports 410,793 immigrants. Of these, 1,063 were not permitted to land under the limitations of the law, and 577 were returned to the countries from whence they came, by reason of their hav ing become public charges. The total ar rivals were 140,034 less than for the previ ous year. The secretary in his report gives an ac count of the operation of the marine hospital service and of the good work done under its super vision, preventing the entrance and spread of contagious caseases. The ad monitions of the last two years touching our public health and the demonstrated danger of the introduction, of contagious diseases from foreign ports has invested the subject of national quarantine within creased interest. A more general and harmonious system tLan now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere and constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the in vasion of diseases and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe, add greatly to the safety of oar people. WAR 

DEPARTMENT, n.iot Tear Far the Armr, The secretary of jar repcrtstis.t tia strength Of the army on me soin Cify oi September last was 25,774 enlisted men and 2,144 officers. The total expenses for this department for the year ending June SO, 1823, amounted to $51,966,074.89. Of this sum $1,692,581.95 was for salaries and contingent expenses, $23,877,828.35 for the support of the military establishments, $6,077,033.18 for miscellaneous objects and $30,518,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes $15,296,876.46 for river and harbor improvements and $3,266,141.20 for fortifications and other works of defense. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was on the 31st of Octo ber of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of the army detailed for the inspection and in structions of this reserve o" our military force report that increased, interest and marked progress are apparent in the dis cipline and efficiency of the organization. Neither Indian outbreaks or domestic violence has called the army into service during the year, and the only active mili tary duty required of it has been in the department of Texas, where violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were promptly and efficiently dealt with .by the troops eliciting the warm approval of the civil and military authorities of both countries. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Some Changes Recommended. The report of the attorney general con tains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the department of justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. I cannot too heartily indorse the proposition that the fee sys tem, as applicable to the compensation of United Statas attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United States com missioners, should be abolished with as little delay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the busi ness of the courts, booh civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of justice will allow. The system is therefore thoroughly I vic ious which makes the compensation of court officials depend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper evecutive of the law and private gam, which cannot fail to be dan gerous to the rights and freedom of the citizens, an irresistable temptation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If in addition to this reform another was inaugurated which would give to United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of mis demeanors, especially those .coming under tne internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made towards a more decent administration of the criminal law. I also heartily join with the attorney general in recommending legislation fix ing degrees of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction as has been done in many of the states, authorizing writs of error on behalf of the government in cases where final judgment is rendered against the sufficiency of an indictment or against the government upon any other question arising before actual trial, limit ing the right of review in cases of felony, punishable only by fine and imprisonment, to the circuit court of appeals and making spe.dy provisionifor the construction of such prisons and reformatories as may be necessary for the confinement of United States convicts. POSTAL AFFAIRS. Deficiency Dne to Free Mail. The report of the postmaster general j contains a detailed statement or the oper ations of the postoffice department during the last fiscal year and much in teresting information touching this im portant branch of the public service. The business of the mails indicates with abso lute certainty the condition of the busi ness of the country and depression in financial affairs inevitably and quickly reduces the postal revenues. That there is a larger discrepancy than usual between the postoffice receipts and expenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing striugency which has pre vailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmas ter general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was esti mated by his predecessor that the defi ciency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be a little over $1,500,000. It amounted, however, to more than $5,000,000. At the same time and under the influence of like anticipations, estimates were made for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $872,245.71, but now, in view of the actual receipts and expendi tures during that part of the current fiscal year already expired, the recent postmas ter general estimates that at its close, in stead of a surplus, there will be a deficiency of nearly $8,000,000. The postoffice receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $75,896,933.16, and its ex penditures to $81,074,104.90. This post office deficiency would disappear, or be im mensely decreased, if less matter was car ried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of postoffices in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year. Forty-two free deliv ery offices were added during the year to those already existing, making a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free de livery on June 30, 1S93. Ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has not been accorded them on account of insuffi cient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary or justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller communities than are now designated. The railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but It is the especial instrumental ity which puts the smaller and way places in the service on an equaiity in that re- fard with the larger and terminal offices, his branch of the postal service has there fore received much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it is grat- J uying so Know lasi ib is m kuuuiwuu oi high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to agree with the postmaster general that there is room for its further improve ment. There are now connected with the postoffice establishment 28,324 employes, who are within ihe classified service. The head of this great department gives con clusive evidence of the value of civil serv ice reform, when, after an experience that renders his judgment on the subject ab solutely reliable, he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system it would be impossible to conduct the vast business intrusted to him. 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. Satisfactory Progress In Cons traction. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his department during the past year and ex hibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. He presents a satisfactory account of the progress which has been made in the construction of ves sels, and makes a number of recommen dation, to which attention is especially in vited. During the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions call ing for vessels to protect American inter est in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras. Argentine aud Brazil, while the condition of affairs in Honolulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these calls upon our navy, it became necessary in order to make np a sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering sea under the modus vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain to detail to that service one vessel from the fish commission and three from the revenue marine. Progress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as was an ticipated. There have been delays in the completion of un armored vessels, but for the most part they have been such as are constantly occurring, even in countries having the largest experience in naval ship building. The most serious delays, however, have been in the work upon armored ships. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to deliver armor a3 agreed. The difSculties seem now, how ever, to have been all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. As a result of the experience acquired by shipbuilders and designers, and material men, it is believed that the dates when vessels will be completed caa now fce estimated wii.li reasonable aecur Rcr. Great guns, rapid firing guns, tor- peaoe3 ana "powuer" are- being "promptly supplied. . Since 1SS5 congress has at each Bession authorized tha building of one or more vessels and the secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommeuds the author ization of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in favor of con sistently pursuing the policy we have in augurated of buildiaa up a thorough and efficient navy, I cannot refrain from the suggestion that the congress should ca.-e-fully take into account the number of un finished vessels on our hands and the de pleted condition of our ti-easury in consid ering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new work. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The Subject of Pensions. The secretary of the interior has the supervision ot so many important sub jects that his report is of especial value and interest. On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an increase of 89,944 over the num ber on the rolls June 30, 1892. Of these, there were 17 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3,882 survivors and wid ows of Indian wars, 2S4 army nurses, and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the war of the rebellion. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pensioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pensions on account of death and disabilities not chargeable to army service was 4.591,555. . The number added to the rolls during the year was 123,634 and the number dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions allowed during the year amounted.to $33,576,549.98. This includes arrears or accumulation between the time, from which the allowunce of the pension date3 and the time of actually granting the certificates. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disabilities not related to military service yet as a re quisite to its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicants from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support. The execution of this law in its early stages does not seem to have been in ac cord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute and since that time this con struction has been followed. The dis covery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gig mtic frauds, the commissioner suspendea pay ments upon a number of pensions which seem to be fraunulent or unauthorized penuing a complete examination. This I understand is the practice which has for a long time prevailed in the pension bureau. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently; put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in which pensions have their origin. Every fraudulent pen sioner has become a bad citizen, every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pensioners rob the peo ple not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of the war, who fought for the preservation of the union, ought to inspire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their well known fraudulent pensioners, and recent devel opments by the bureau established appall ing conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By. no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be ac cused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. The sum ex pended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893, was $156,740,-467.-14. The commissioner estimates that $165,000,000 will be required to pay pen sions during the year ending June 30, 1894. Our Indians number about 248,000 and taost o them are located on 161 reserva tions, containing 86,116,531 acres of land, about 110,000 of these Indians have, to a large' degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in several territories have fcen al loted to many ot them. The law pro viding, that except iu especial cases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian agents, it is hoped, will prove a successful experi ment. The Public Domain. The vast area of land which, but a short time ago constituted the public domain, is rapidly falling into private hands. It is certain that the intention of the govern ment to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy homeseekers is often frustrated through speculators. Yet it is difficult to thwart their schemes. The recent opening to settlement of the lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an irea of 6,500,000 acres, notwithstanding the utmost care in framing the rvguia tions governiig the selection of location And notwithstanding the presence of United States troops furnished an exhibi tion, though perhaps in a modified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence, and the fraudulent occupation which have ac tompanied previous openings of public lands. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these outrageous incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change iu the laws on the subject and I hop9 his recom mendations in that direction will be favor ably considered. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. Secretary Morton's Economic Policy. The report of the secretary of agricul ture will be found exceedingly interesting especially to that large part of our citi zens intimately concerned in agricultural occupations. On the 7th day of March, 1893, there were upon its pay rolls, 2.430 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demand of the people for economy in the administra tion of their government, the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the elimination from the pay roll of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affairs of the department. During the first quarter of the present year the ex penses of the department aggregated $345, 976.76, as against $402,021.42 for the cor responding period of the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1893. The secretary makes apparent his intention to continue this rate of reduction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,280 than thosa of the present year. The regulations of 1893 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the last year, and the largest stock yards of the country have been kept free from infec tion. Occasional local outbreaks have been largely such as could have been effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle. While contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal tuber culosis, a disease corresponding and more dangerous to human life than pleuro pneumonia, is still prevalent Investiga tions have been made during the past year as to the means of its communication and the method of its correct diagnosis. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending: June 30. 1892. attained the enor mous figure of $800,000,000 in round num bers, being 78.7 per cent oi our total ex ports. Of pork products the total exports were $84,000,000, of which Great Britain took $53,000,000. In Dreaastuiis, cotton and minor products, like proportions sent to the same destinations are shown. - A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination will show that in almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ire land absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, $28,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over $25,000,000; of beef products of all kinds, our total exports were 28,000,000, of which Great Britain took $24,000,000. " From a small beginning, the seed di vision of the department of agriculture haa grown to its present nnwieldiy and unjustifiabiy extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $06,543.61. The re mainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was expanded in paiiing them up and dis tributing them. It surely naver could have entered the minds cf those who first sanctioned appropriations of public raoney for the purcuas; of sew and improved varieties cf seeds for gratuitous distribu tion, tcTAt from this wouI3 grow Targe ap propriations for the purchase and distribu tion by membsrs of congress of ordinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings which are com mon in all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtainable atlowprices. Under the sanction of existing legisla tion there was sent out from the agricul tural department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage seed to plant 19, 200 acres of land, a sufficent quantity of beans to- plant .4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7,800 acres sufficient cu cumber seed to cover 2,025 acres with vines and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant 2,675 acres. The total quan tity of flower and vegetable seeds thus dis tribute i was contained in more than 9,000, 00Q packages and they were sufficient if planted to cover 89,596 acres of land. In view of these facts this enormous ex penditure without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipat ing a consummation so manifestly in the interests of good administration, more than $100,000 has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30. 1894; and the secre tary recommends that the remaining $35, 000 of the estimate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varie ties of seeds, and these be distributed through experiment stations. Thus the seed will be tested, and after the test has been completed by the experiment station the propagation of the useful varieties and tue.rejection.of the valueless may safe ly be left to the common sense of the peo ple. The Civil Service Law. The continued intelligent execution of the civil service law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent extension of its limitations .and regulations to the em ployes at free delivery postoffices, which has been honestly and promptly accom- Elished by the commission, with the earty co-operation of the postmaster gen eral, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. I am, if possible, more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law not only in its effect upon the public service, but also that it is even more important in its effect in elevating the tone of Dolitical life generally. The course of civil service reform in this country instructively and interestingly illustrates how strong a hold a movement gains upon our people, which has under lying it a sentiment of justice and right, and which at the same time promises bet ter administration of their government. The law embodying this reform found its way into our statute book more from fear of the popular sentiment existing in its fa vor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and it has lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert and open hostil ity of spoilmen and, nothwithstanding the querulous impracticability of many self constituted guardians, beneath all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it. there underlies this re form a sturdy conimou-sense principle, not only suited to this sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be absolutely essential to the most successful operation of their gov ernment, if not to its perpetuity. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the character of this reform, as well as with its best enforcement, to oblige the commission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other depart ments. There ought not to be such a condition in any department that clerks hired to do the work there can be spared to habitual ly work at another place, and it does not accord with a sensible view of civil ser vice reform that persons should be em ployed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devoted to en tirely different work in another depart ment, I earnestly arge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the com mission, be regularly put upon its roster, and that the system of obliging the com missioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other departments be discontinued. This ought not to increase the expense to the government, while it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the efficiency ot the com mission. Economy in public expend iture is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those intrusted with the coutrol of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless re sources, the familiarity of our people with immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of money should be in some manner to their immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. At this time when a depleted public treasury confront us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life and when enforced economy' is pressing upon the great mass of our countrymen, I desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that con gressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an apprecia tion of the condition of the treasury and a Sympathy with the strained circumstances of our fellow citizens. The duty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to tha task now in hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the peo ple's burden of federal taxation. 

TARIFF REFORM. Botb an Opportunity and a Datr. After a hard struggle tariff reform is di rectly before us. Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as botb an opportunity and duty; an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizens, a duty imposed upon us by oft repeated professions and by the em phatic mandate of the people. After full discussion, our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have con fided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. If there is anything in the theory of a representation in public places of the people and their desires, if political officers are really the servants of tiie peo ple and if political promises and profes sions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will l.e sheer recreancy. Nothing should inter vene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform -is accom plished by wise and careful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal txition, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close ou - eyes to the fact that conditions have grown np among us, which in justice and. fairness cll for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergen cies of our government actually demand. Manifestly if we are to- aid the people directly through tariff reform one of its most obvious features should be a reduc tion in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and substan tial, seen and felt by thousands wno would be better fed, and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts shen Id be the willing benefactions of a government .whose highest function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not leas closely related to the prosperity and well being of our people is the removal of re strictions npon the importation of the raw materials necessary to our manufacturer. The world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. Interests of labor Involved. This cannot ba while federal leglslaticn through the imposition of high tariff for bids to American manufacturers as cheap materials as these use! by tbeir competi tors. It is quite obvious that the enhance ment of the price of our manufacture.! products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for thes pro ducts within our own borders to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor are csrtainly, though indirectly, involved in this feature of our tariff systera. The sharp competition and active strug gle anions our manufacturers to supply the limiu-d demand for their goods, soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills aod factories, a discharge of employes, and di?tte3 in the homes of oar wcrXiEriitn.

A measure has been prepared by the ap- Eropriate congressional committee em odying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly sub mitted for legislative action. It is the re sult of much patriotic and unselfish work and I believe it deals with its subject con sistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions permit. I am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation, added to existing in ternal revenue taxation, will in the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The committee after full consideration and to provide against a temporary defi ciency which may exist befoie the busi ness of the country adjusts itsslf to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain cor porations. These new assessments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they have the further means of being such as can be remitted without unfavor able business disturbances whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer ex ists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the sug gestion that its success can only be at tained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of their willingness to sub ordinate personal desires and ambition to the general good. The local int rests af fected by the proposed reform are so num erous and so varied that if all are in sisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion, my intense feeling of re sponsibility impels me to invoke for the manifold interests of a generous and con fiding people the most scrupulous care, and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our be loved country.
