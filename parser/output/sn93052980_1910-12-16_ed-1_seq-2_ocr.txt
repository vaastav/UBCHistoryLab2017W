From vow on, until the location of the county high school is finally settled, the people are to be bombarded with peti tions and arguments in favor of one or other of the proposed locations. The decision rests first with the county board of education acting as a high school board. This board is or ganized and ready for business. It requires a unanimous vote of the board to permanently locate the school. Failing to agree on this pomt — and there is little hope for any other outcome — the board may decide upon a temporary site by a majority vote. The board is composed of five members, so that three can fix the temporary location, and refer it to the voters to determine the permanent location at a special elec tion called for that purpose. The decision of the board as to the temporary location will be a decided advantage in the special election. We understand that each place contesting for the honor of having the high school must be prepared with the offer o f a site. This is probably designed to insure a suitable site at a fair price, andjnot to be construed as re quiring the site to be free of charge to [the taxpayers who have voted for the establishment of the school. The latter interpretation seems to be entertained by not^a few, but in our opinion is demoralizing and out 'of joint with the prin ciples of law and justice. Among the arguments trotted out to induce the board to settle the matter finally by a unani mous vote for Sutter Creek it is urged that the county would thereby be. spared the expense of a special election. The same argument might be used with equal force in behalf of any other proposed location. But the bare fact of saving the cost of a special election is worthy of no consideration what ever when opposed to the honest conviction of the board as to the most suitable place from the viewpoint of accommodation and accessibily to the greater number of likely pupils. : It is rumored that subscriptions are being solicited from individuals to influence the selectiou of the site by hotding out a fat purse for the building and equipment of the school, thereby offering relief to the general taxpayers from the whole or part of the burden. This course might not be objection able after the location has been settled, as a grateful appre ciation of the residents of the successful locality. But to adopt this method beforehand seems to us a vicious and corrupting policy unworthy of being countenanced [in any public cause, and particularly reprehensible in a high school movement. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Taft's first message to congress will [serve to al lay any apprehension in the public mind as to liklihood of any disturbance of business interests by a tendency toward extrein.e radicalism, He is fully abreast of the demand for a pause in the eiiactment of laws intended to further curb the big coiporations in their activities. He recommends the enforcement of existing anti-trust laws, and ascertaining defi nitely the effect thereof, before proceeding to place any more laws on the statute books on this subject. He is also opposed to any attempt at a general revision of the tariff at this time, leaving modifications to be made, one schedule at a time, at the recommendation of a permanent tariff board, after an impartial and scientific investigation. The present tariff, notwithstanding the- severe and in a great measure un just criticism to which it has beeu subjected, has worked fairly well in practice. It has largely increased the revenues showing that was a revision downward in [accordance with the declaration of the platform of the last/ republican na tional convention. At the same time there has been no seri ous disturbance of business on account of the changes; show ing that the measure is wisely framed both from the stand point of the consumer and manufacturer. That it may be improved upon is not doubted, but the president believes that this can be better accomplished by amendment by the tariff board thau by the drafting of a new bill covering the whole field. ' Another strong point is the recommendation for the prac tice of strict economy in all branches of,,the government, without impairment of efficiency. As emphasising this mat ter, under the administration of the present postmaster-gen eral a saving of fifteen million dollars has been effected in one year. And the president favors the same rigid economy applied all along the line. All through, the message is a conservative and business like document. It creates the impression that a statesman of the highest order is at the head of the government, under whose guiding hand all the vast interests of the nation will be zealously safe-guarded.
