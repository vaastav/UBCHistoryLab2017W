Socorro s airead v possessed of as gd a telephone service as any city in the land can boast of, and she will soon be blessed with a strictly up-to-date electric light and power plant. The Gem City has had a pretty hard row to hoe for many years past, but she is now beginning to feel the stimu lus of more prosperous times. Thk first issue of the Las Ve tas Weekly News reached the Chieftain office this week. The News is edited by a news paper man of a good many years exeriencr, who affords in this first issue of his paper the best possible evidence that he knows a god thing in the news paper line when he sees it. Tin: New Mexico School of Mines, located at Socorro, is second to no other educational in stitution in the territory in point of efficient, practical service to young men in atten dance. The School now has more advanced technical students than ever before. In fact, the institution was never before in as prosperous a condition in all res pects as now, and thos; respon sible for this pleasing state of af fairs don't care who knows it. It is estimated that by the first of April of the coming year New Mexico will contain over 3K),000 inhabitants, or a gain of a!out M) per cent, since the 1900 census. Judging from as reliable information as can be gathered, this estimate is not overdrawn.' So says the Santa Fe New Mexi can, anu me iNew Mexican is in a better position than any other paper in the Territory is to have accurate information on that sub ject. Three hundred thousand is a gratifying figure, but still there is room. aocoRKO, expects great goou from Max Kirchman's Bohemian colony project, and there is good reason to believe that she wil not be disappointed in her expec tation. Mr. Kirchman is a sue cessful business man and, natu rally enough, he has undertaken this enterprise in a perfectly busi ness-like manner and apirit. lie expects to add two or three thou sand to the population of Socorro county within the next five years and especially to bring about many improvements in conditions in this city. lie has already received and will continue to re ceive abundant encouragement. Tho.sk opposed to joint state hood have repeatedly and post tively asserted that those in fa vor of that kind of statehood are in a very small minority while those in favor of joint state hood have just as repeatedly and just as positively asserted tha those opposed are mighty sraal potatoes and few in a hill. Now however, President Roosevelt has said in his message thathe isinfa vor of joint statehood. Governor elect ILigerman had already made a similar declaration, and Dele gate Andrews will at once intro duce a joint statehood bill in con gress. It is altogether possible, therefore, that the people of New Mexico and Arizona will soon have an opportunity to count noses on this important question, and we hall then know where the ma jority really lies. Thk Fifty-ninth congress con vened Monday noon. The ses sion promises to be one of the most interesting as well atone of. the most important for years. opular interest will doubtless be centered mainly on legislation ooking to the regulation of rail road rates and the control of life insurance companies, while mea sures to promote the construction of the Panama canal will hardly be second in interest and impor tance. The president will use all his great influence, both poli tical and personal, in behalf of such legislation and the popular sympathy which he already com mands will be intensified by the common conviction that he will be opposed' by certain great but unsavory corporate influences. The proceedings of the session will be intently noted. Hon. Frank W. Parker, asso ciate justice for the third judicial district, can hardly escape re-ap pointment at the expiration of his present term of office. If the hearty endorsement of the people of the district is all that is re quired he certainly can notescape, for it is extremely doubtful whether a baker's dozen of voters could be found in the entire dis trict who would not prefer Judge Parker to anybody else for the position which he has already filled for two terms so acceptably. The respect which Judge Parker commands and the popularity which is his are easily accounted for. Everybody who has ever come into contact with him in his official capacity has been im pressed with his ability, hisimpar tiality, his sincerity, and his un failing courtesy. These qualities command respect and esteem al ways, and at this particular time they afford the best possible rea son for the movement in favor of the re-appointment of Judge Parker.

'Some weeks ago during the severe winter weather both my wife and myself contracted severe colds which speedily developed into the worst kind of la grippe with all its miserable symptoms, says Mr. J. S. Egleston of Maple Landing, Iowa. "Knees and joints aching, muscles sore, head stopped up, eyes and nose run ning, with alternate spells of chills and fever. We began us. ing Chamberlain's Cough Reme dy, aiding the same with a dose of Chamberlain's Stomach and Liver Tablets, and by its liberal use soon completely knocked out the grip." These tablets promote a healthy action of the bowels, liver and kidneys, which is always beneficial wtien the system is congested by a cold or attack o: the grip. For sale by all drug gists. Oaaton Abroad. While King Alfonso of Spain was riding with President Loubet through the streets of Paris a bomb was thrown at him. There upon, says the New York Times, the following discourse took place: "Whom are they after?" quer ied the Spanish monarch. And the president replied, in the choicest Parisian: "After you, my dear Alfonse." 

SAMURAI AND JIU-JITSU. Tha Moat Wonderful System of Ath letics In tha World. More than 2,500 years ago there sprang into existence in Japan an order of knights who were known as the samurai. To them was imparted all the learning, the po lite breeding and the forms of su periority that mark the gentle man. They were skilled in arms and versed in the arts of war, for they were the emperor's fighting men, and none but they were al lowed to bear arms. As there could not always be war on hand, and as it was con sidered beneath the dignity of the samurai to go into any ordinary callings, it came about naturally that these little knights found much idle time on their hands. Being men of war, they turned their attention to athletic feats. One among the samurai con ceived the idea of learning by practice the location of every sen sitive nerve and muscle in the body. After that he discovered all the joints of the bones that could be seized in such a way as to give momentary power over the muscles of an adversary. He practiced with his fellow samurai, and thus by degrees was devel oped the most wonderful system of athletics known in the world. The Japanese call this work jiu-jitsu. The deft pressures ap plied in the practice of jiu-jitsu produce only momentary pain, but do not really injure the muscles or nerves. In all other things the Japanese are the most polite peo ple in the world. So it follows that even in their fighting they have developed a humane yet, ef fective method of. self defense. They do not strike out with the clinched list and seek to bruise, as do the Anglo-Saxons in their boxing contests. A knowledgeof jiu-jitsu enables one almost instantly to convince his opponent that it is useless to tight. There are now schools of jiu-jitsu everywhere in Japan Every soldier, sailor and police man is obliged to perfect himself in the system. A Japanese po liceman, possessed of the art, has been known single handed to re duce to submission and to take to the police station four sturdy sailors of a foreign Asiatic squa dron. St. Nicholas.

Somewhat Different. "This question whether a word should have its adverbial or its objective form seems to me to have little to do with the sense Now what is the difference be tween talking loud and talking loudly?"

A NARROW ESCAPE. Dramatic Climax to an Exciting Will Contest Caae. ' The conversation turned óh th'é momentous effects of trifles at times when they were least ex pected to have any influence at all, and this reminded Mr.Tliómp son of an episode in his own prac tice as a lawyer.". . .

Moore, pastor of the Baptist church of Harpersville, N. Y., will interest you. He says: "I suffered agonies, be cause of a persistent cough, re suiting from the grip.
