THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1899. that ths Insurgents are, as he predicted a few days ago. at the end of their resources from a military point of view, and are melting away before the rapid advance of the American troop3 at all points. His ca blegrams were as follows: "Fifty men of the navy and fifty men of the army, transported by the navy, took laoas on the 10th inst. General Young, with Man!, followed next day. lie reports that Howse, with Penn's battalion of the Thirty-fourth, followed by a portion of the Thirty-third Infantry, had passed north to Ptddlng. east of Laoag. Marsh's battalion . of the Thirty-fourth was at Cayan, prov- ince of Lapanto. on the 7th inst. The Third Cavalry was along the coast and in thi mountains pursuing the enemy. Young states his extreme northern force passed over the mountains, driving the insurgents under General Tino, who was badly wounded, killing fifty and wounding many, lie made large captures of rilles and prop erty, with ail insurgent transportation, and released all the Spanish prisoners in that section, to the number of alxmt two thou sand. Our casualties were two wounded. Our troops are still pursuing the remnant of Tlno's command. "March's battalion of the Thirty-third it-ports from Cayan. Lepanto province, on the 7th Inst., that he has destroyed Ag uinaldo's bodyguard, killed General Grego rio Pilar, received the surrender of General Concepclon and staff, killed and wounded tlfty-two insurgents, released 573 Spanish prisoners, including 150 friars, and captured considerable property. His loss was two killed and nine wounded. "My Information is that Agulnaldo has disguised hh individuality, abandoned his troops, and is hiding In the province of Benguet. "Admiral Watson informs me that the province of Cayagan surrendered uncondi tionally to Captain McCally, of the New ark, on the 11th Inst., all arms being sur rendered. Major Batchelor Is ninety miles uth of Apparri, with his command in pood condition. Navy will take supplies to Batchelor in launch at once. This sur lender doubtless includes the province of Isabella. General Bates, at Zamboanga, reports affairs there satisfactory. Nearly all rilles surrendered. MacArthur, at Bayombong. reports that he holds as prisoner of war Mabinl, the ablest of insurgents and found er of the late government." ADMIRAL WATSON'S DISPATCHES. The naval account of the operations of the ships In Luzon is contained in two cablegrams from Admiral Watson, at Cavlte. They follow: "Burwell reports that the Wheeling landed a naval forte and a detachment of triKjps, Kaiser commanding, sixteen miles northwest of Laong, and attacked the city yesterday, releasing 1.500 Spaniards. Am holding, at the request of General Young ao casualties. "General Tlrona, commanding the Fili pino, unconditionally surrendered Aparri .nd Cayagan province to Captain McCalla, of the Newark, on the' 11th of December. Princeton and. Helena, at present In the river. AH arms and ammunition surren dered. Tlrona surrendered from patriotic motives, to prevent further bloodshed. He was appointed civil governor by McCalla, subject to the approvalof Otis. The He lena, was dispatched up the river wit! stores for Batchelor's troops, ninety miles south of Aparri. Aparri and Lugana light bouses relighted." The secretary of war regards' the Infor mation conveyed in General OMs's dis patches to-day as the most important that has come to hand for months past. The capture of Mabinl. reported by MacArthur, from Bayombong. is especially gratifying. It Is believed the Filipino leader wa? try ing to make his way across country from Eenguet, where he had been obliged to part company with Agulnaldo a fortnight ago, to the east coagt of Luzon. The mem bers of the Philippine commission now In Washington declare, without reserve, that Mabinl was the head and front of the In surrection. Agulnaldo was only a figure head. Mabinl was the brain and directing power behind him. He is a paralytic, an old man, but of extraordinary ability and his counsels were always conclusive with the Filipinos. He was concerned In the first up rising against the Spaniards. For a short time he wavered upon Agulnaldo's breach with the Americans, but finally cast his fortune with the Insurrection and was president of the Council. He was also the financial strength of the movement, as. without his backing, Agulnaldo would have had no credit. Next in Importance to the capture of Ma binl, in the developments of the campaign, was the bold stroke of Captain McCalla, of the Newark. In capturing the whole prov ince of Cayagan. With MacArthur holding the province of Isabella adjoining, nnd Young's holdings on the opposite or west ern shore of the upper peninsula, the American forces are now in technical occu pation of the whole northern end of Luzon, from a point Just north of the Gulf of Lln gayen. McCalla posted at the port of Aparri. the only good port on the northern end of the Island, commands the greater part of the whole length of the Rio Grande, affording entrance by boats to a full third of the interior of the Island. It Is up this river that Captain McCalla is send ing steam launches carrying supplies to Major Batchelor. The latter officer, with a few negro sol diers of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, has Just completed one of the most daring marches connected with the present cam paign. Detaching his little force from Mac Arthur a week ago, he drove straight through the center of the island north ward, cutting loose from his communica tions and bound to reach Aparri, or be cap tured or killed In the attempt. Captain Mc Calla's advices' indicate that he has suc ceeded, being now within touch of the navy on the north shore. r.ate3s report lrom the southern archi pelago has allayed the apprehension ex cited for the security of things there, growing out of the agitation by the mis leading publications of Important insurgent victories. Altogether the advices con tained in to-day's dispatches have given great satisfaction to the officials of the War Department.

When seen to-day in ref erence to tne allegations made at Manila by Colonel Julio del Rio, a Spanish officer, and Senor Ilarael Roselo, a merchant, Capt. Coghlan said: "Why, It Is ridiculous talk ing of our having made any concessions. There was absolutely no necessity for any. I was ordered to capture the island and did not lose any time In doing It. I sent an officer ashore and immediate and un conditional surrender was made to him. We took, I think. 635 prisoners, more than that number of Remington rllles, a quan tity of ammunition, pistols, swords and several cannon. I did not go ashore and never saw Col. Uel Rio. Senor Roselo or any of the prisoners other than through my glas on the ship. In consequence I could give them no personal assurance as to the future, neither did I empower my officer to make any stipulations and I never heard of him so doing. In conse quence there was no violation of any agree ment. "Instead of sailing away on the even of the 7th and leaving the garrison prac tically unarmed and permitting the in surgents to frequently fire upon the town, we simply moved about three miles out of the bay and anchored. We were always In view of the town, with our searchlight playing upon it. We had not then taken the arma of the Spaniards and I had no tified the insurgent commander that he must not Interfere and my instructions were obeyed. When I was ordered to place the prisoners on board the Insurgent boat Filiplnas it was done on the morning of the Sth by my men and in our small boats. No assurances whatever were given the pris oners as to their care or disposition. We did not have to." Captain Coghlan states that he never re ported that the German cruiser Irene slipped her cable upon the appearance of the Raleigh and oncord In Subig bay, al though jome such rumor gained circulation.

SOLDIERS WELL T II KATE D. Putnam County Dor Write off ill Life In the Philippine. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. GREENCASTLE. Ind.. Dec. 13.-In a let ter to his parents in this county Ernest L. Macy. of Battery B. Sixth Artillery, gives some Interesting Information concerning the treatment of soldiers In the Philippines and his and other Americans' opinions of Agulnaldo and his band. He says: We have plenty to eat and have a good place to sleep, as I am working In the ar senal and do not have to go out on the rlrln? ii'ie only to take the ammunition to the men in the rifie pits. Several of the boys have received letters from their friends, asking if it is true that they are nearly starved and mistreated other ways. To such questions we have only the one answer to make and that is that we would Just as soon soldier here as anywhere and our treatment !s Just as good herfc as It was in the States. "If those fellows that are trying to make heroes out of 'Aggie and his iollowers would only come over here ar'i let them get their clutches on them I guess It would soon cure them of some of their false im pressions. The Insurgents as a whole are a set of uncivilized barbarians. They care no more for human life than we would for a dog's; care no more for their word than If truth were unknown. They are too lazy to work and 1 think that is one of their causes for taking up arms, as It gives them licence to ravage the country and carry off what they can and burn what they can't carry. It is no use to say we can't whip them for we will whip them and before many months roll around, and then we will have one of the most fertile islands on the globe. A to the native Fil ipino he is quick at Imitation and I think that after he comes In contact wltu the civilizing inlluence of American government for a few years ami comes In nodal contact with the American citizens, they will soon learn to adopt their ways. And if he don't make a good citizen he will, at least, make a better one than he Is now or ever has been. Those that have been in our lines since last spring have be come quite Americanized. I have charge of about twenty-five natives and Chinese and I now like the natives lots the best." Xo One Will Father the Story. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.-CoIonel Long, the quartermaster In charge of army trans portation at San Francisco, who was re cently instructed by Quartermaster General Ludington to investigate the report pub lished in certain newspapers that Major John A. Logan. U. S. V., had been killed by his own soldiers as an act of revenge, reports to the quartermaster general by telegraph to-day that he has mailed a re port of the result of the investigation. Col. Long says that Koppitz, the freight clerk who was alleged to have made the allega tions, denies officially and positively mak ing any such statement to a newspaper representative or to any other person. "Captain Coulllng can find no one on the ship," says Colonel Long, "who made such remarks, and is satisfied. If made, it was by fome irresponsible party." KEENLY CRITICISED. Von BneloTT Speech by Ruwnian Press and Politician!. ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 13.-The speech of the German minister of foreign affairs. Count Von Buelow, In the Reichstag yes terday Is keenly criticised here both by the press and public on account of what are regarded as pronounced declarations In favor of German hegemony and their gen erally warlike and threatening tone. The Novoe, Vremya and other papers take a more favorable view of Count Von Buelow's speech. The Novostl says: "The speech confirms the general belief in the peace-loving policy of Germany." The Herald says: "Russia Is as con vinced of Germany's sincere love of peace as of her own. Count Von Iluelow for the first time in history alluded to the re lations between Russia anu Germany as Germany's security In Europe." Miquel Defends the Emperor. BERLIN, Dec. 13. In the Reichstag to day there was a continuation of the budget debate. Dr. Von clique!, the minister of finance, replied to the criticisms of the Emperor's Hamburg speech made by Dr. Lleber, the Centrist leader. He said the speech had found a patriotic echo in the hearts of millions of Germans and had also been a warning against the excessive growth of party politics. The speaker said he was not responsible for the speech. This was a case In which the Emperor needed no counselor. The navy bill as announced was not beyond the financial strength of Germany, and the Centrist?, he asserted, would ultimately admit the necessity of it. McKinley's Sentiments Cheered. ROME; Dec. 13.

Princeton Men Held to Court for Criminal Practice City off Frank lin Grants Railway Franchise. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. MUNCIE, Ind., Dec. 13. The Muncle po lice are In a quandary and gamblers hold a position of uneasiness since the recent de cision of Mayor Tuhey in the disposal of some cases resulting from raids by the po lice. There were three arrests and a great amount of furniture was taken. In one prosecution, on the charge of operating a gambling room, the accused, John L. Svel gart, was found not guilty, and1 the peker, crap, faro, roulette and stud poker tables returned. In two other cases there were convictions, one of the men pleading guilty to being the proprietor of a gambling room, but the furniture secured at his place was returned, because the prosecutors did not see it in use and could not testify in a man ner that warranted its destruction. Ac cording to the opinion of Mayor Tuhey, it Is necessary for the police to burst in doors and catch the men playing cards or other games for money or chips which the police know have been purchased with money. In other words, It Is almost impossible to con vict gamblers In Muncle. On the other hand, the several raids that were made caused some of the gamblers to ship their furniture to other towns, and others have closed their places and are afraid to re sume business. Muncle never has been so free of gambling houses as now, but sev eral clubs are being incorporated with the secretary of state, f Action at Law Decided. Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
