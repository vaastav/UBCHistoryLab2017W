Journal and Post combined. RECONSTRUCTION, The appointment of a Joint Committee of the two Houses of Congress on Reconstruc tion, and the reference to such Committee of the credentials of the members elect from Tennessee, indicate that the American people as represented in Congress, Intend to exert their proper Influence over the w hole subject of reconstruction. Tennessee has more plaus ible claims for Immediate admission than any other Stale. In the Eastern part of the State the majority of the white population were loyal to the Union throughout tbc war. That portion ofthe Stale has elected members to Congress who personally would make worthy and respectable representatives. In the divi ded condition of the State during tbc war Us white population rendered some sup]>ort to the Union, though a great deal more to the rebellion. The present effort at reconstruc- stmcUon was begun under the Governorship of Andrew Johnson, nnd the President's do* sire that the Government of that' Stale shall l»c hcldto he already fully reconstruc ted, and that its. representatives shall be admitted, is well known. Tet by an emphatic vote, including,all the Republicans la the Senate, except Cowan, Dixon, and Doolittle, and by the uuanlmous rote of the Republican majority Jn the House, with only a dissenting squeak from Mr. Raymond, Congress passed the Tennessee credentials to the same com mittee which will receive those from the other Slates, the Joint Committee on Recon struction. All this is on emphatic contradic tion of the President’s statement in his mes sage, that It now only remains for the seceded States, having voted for the Constitutional Amendment, 16 resume their places Id the Union, while Congress will judge merely of the regularity of their certificates of action. This attitude of Congress Is sound. It rep resents the loyal people of Hus country ex actly. It will afford Congress time to mature its own plan of reconstruction, and to come forward in solid phalanx In favor of a policy will eh shall represent the interests of the whole people of the South, and of the coun try, and not merely of the late rebels. Something more than mere delay in the business of reconstruction is necessary on the part of Congress. Their course will fall to satisfy the country If it tends merely to stave off the issue. What justice and statesman ship demand, what the late elections demon strate that the people demand, is not so much a postponement of reconstruction for its own sake, as that subversion and overthrow of the President’s partial and one-sided .mode of reconstruction In reference to the voting basis, which restores rebels to power through out the South and dooms a whole race to peonage or bondage, until wiser counsels or a bloody revolution shall wrest from their op pressors their fair share of political rights. Every Republican victory at the last election Is a verdict in favor of extending the suffrage in some form to some portion of the foar millions, who embrace a third of the popula tion and nineteen-twentieths of the industry, morality, loyalty and republicanism of the Southern people. In this matter President Johnson’s point of departure was wrong, and every step he has since taken has only made tbe wrong more manifest and glaring. He assumes that even In States where two-thirds of the citlzcnsure colored, they are to have no rights except those which the political minority choose to confer upon them. This is an undemocratic blunder and will convert the South into another Jamaica, a scene of slow torture for the black man and of continued despotism and terror to the white. It will condemn the South to hopeless poverty, crime, and vio lence. We do not ask that any Ignorant, de praved, panper whether black or white, shall vote. Bat we do ask that intelligent, moral, sell-supporting men of whatever color shall not be excluded by law from any avenue to influence or usefulness to which their abilities and the votes of their fellow-citizens would raise them. We demand this in the name of the principles of the Republican party and of the Declaration of Independence. Weaskit as the proper fruit of the war, the completion of the work of emancipation. We ask it In the name of the martyred Lincoln, as he ex pressed Ids convictions in his letter to Gov Bohn and to Gen. Wadsworth. To do this it will be the duty cf Congress, If need bo, to Join issue with any earthly power that desires to make the issue, and try the matter out as a question of power. But the cod will never be attained If Congress merely dallies with and postpones the Presi dent’s plan. Do Congress need further light upon the question ? Most more “black codes ” be passed, in all their hideous atroc ity, more freedmen massacred, 'more rebels elected to office at the Booth? Must more Legislatures grant bounties to rebel troops while rofusiDg them to loyal soldiers ? Most more petitions be sent up for the lives of liv ing traitors, more church prayers refused even to the President who champions their equality? Must more be tendered to living rebels, or more mono* men Is erected to dead ones? Most more arrogance be displayed by the haughty rebel minority In South Carolina and Mississippi in overriding the rights of the loyal majority and disfranchising them utterly in the Courts and at the ballot box, except where the Presi dential edict, behind which glitters the mem ory of a million of bayonets, compels some re luctant compliance with justice? If Con gress desire more of all this let them wait; but while they wait events will crowd past them, and the opporlinity lor justice without revolution will be gone. Our thirty-seven States will once more Join hands over the crater of our volcano and await Us next ex plosion. If Congress is so profoundly pervaded by an absence of Independence, vigor and states manship, ns to write itself down the mere recorder of the preferences of the executive, then it will allow reconstruction to proceed on the basis already tried and found wanting- If not, end wc believe U will not, it will take a nc%r point of dopariuro, wmeu” shall be in hurmeny with the genius ofßopublican in stitutions. It will do this by maturing in its Joint committee on reconstruction, a general enabling act for those districts of the South in which State governments fonnerlv existed, whereby they shall be constitution ally governed so long as they remain in a ter ritorial condition, by a Governor lawfully ap. pointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and by a Territorial Legislature elected by such portion of the population as the enabling act shall permit to vote. The majority of all the people of the South and Us entire lo\nl and anti-slavery population lavor this course to-day. Heretofore the President Las treated the question of re con . struction ns a military one, over which he alone as Conimandcr-in-CMef of the Army and Navy-had Jurisdiction, and to which the constitution and laws of the United States and the powers of Congress did not apply. He has appointed Governors of States wlthont {ikying their confirmation by the Senate, and has substituted his Presidential proclamation lor the enabling acts by which Congress Lad previously directed the formation of State governments In territory where none existed. But let Congress'adopt the sound doctrine that State governments, must . be con* structcd In tho, same manner as the State governments of every State, since the original thirteen, were constructed, viz: by the Joint action of Congress, as ex pressed in an enabling act. or an act of admis sion,and substantially the whole people of the territory seeking a State government. When wc adopt this doctrine we strike the hard pan of constitutional law and precedent, and the coarse U plain before us. THE 

9USSOI7BI-REGISTRY LilT. The passage "by both booses of the Mis souri legislature, of the new Registry* Law is the final triumph of Radicalism in that State. It puls an end to •ballot-staffing. It confronts every wonld-bc-votcr with the test -oath prescribed ia the new Slate constitution, and makes him in name if not in heart lovah. In its general features it is copied vcrylclosely from the Kcw Fork Registry Law, bat In its operations as adopted In Missouri, U does more than open Ibe Bsl to the easy puMiha&c of a false oathr* Any voter can challenge the right to • register on' any grounds, Including that of disloyalty, the- challenge to be de cided upon by a Board of Registry to be up ]H>intcd by the Governor and the County Courts. Some of the machinery is new, and may not work snoothly, bn tin IU Betting nr, and in whatever modification it may receive, ?. sufficient assurance la given that the adher ents of extinct rebellion and slavery in Mis souri have a narrow field for xnhehUT, end none at all lor success. , . t BOSTOK AXD XU It WEST. Boston capital has done a great deal for the West, In developing our railroad system and giving us generally our start in life. But Boston has come latterly to remind us of the thrifty fore, busy in establishing his sons in their new homes, for which he la pleased and careful to eld them in securing all the modern appliances and utilities,' the "good bid soul himself jogging along at the ancient home stead in the same narrow fashions, with which he set out, a generation ago. It pleases him that his sons shall have Concord wagons; for himself wooden springs and wooden axle trees have become second nature. . Year after year the Boston people have been tubing of avenues to the West, and trade from the West. They have dined end. wined on the topic. They have buOt miles on miles of rail road through sparsely settled and remote re gions in the name of it.. And yet they have not got it. The trouble is, that twenty-five years ago they came to the conclusion that as far West as the New England frontier the Tfork was done for all time- Sec the Western , Railroad and die, was the State motto, home ; aloft by a State director. Trade from the West has seen the Western Railroad, and it has died, or at least season after season of it has been strangled by huge piles of delayed freight, New England bound and hopelessly cm borgoed for weeks In the very season when Boston should be the most ready to receive the trade of the West, in the movement of fall products. There arc numerous railroads leading into Boston, but they arc pnrely local attain, with about the same idea of a Western mission as' the hucksters' carts from across the Mill Dam that make dally trips to Pancnll Hall Market. They have, indeed, their “ connections,” and go through perhaps twenty or fifty mites fur ther than their own lines without change of cars, but the leat is attended with so much trouble, and they are continually In so sad a muddle about division of freight receipts, that they prefer, as a general thing, to sol emnly dismiss, to fresh hands and cars, every few score of miles, the Boston rocking-chairs, shoe-boxes, and other goodly Boston notions* thdr city affords lor shipment. What a Bos ton commercial journal of excellent sense calls the “Western Railroad Malady,” has held fast upon the entire railroad system oi Massachusetts and New England. The local facilities are adequate. We bear no com plaints of trouble in the connections between Boston and Berkshire, or the White Hills. It U only when inquiry is made as to how the demands of Western trade arc met, that a lamentable answer, or no answer at all, comes bock from shippers of freight to the New England seaboard. Let Boston merchants and all others inter ested In the prosperity of that city, give this matter that kind of attention that will work a change. One change would help greatly—a change of management. A first class, well equipped road like either of the Michigan roads, would take the place and quadruple the efficiency of that dallcst of concerns, the Albany road, besides reaching some form of adjustment with the Boston and Worcester that should cause the Albany route to resem ble less than it docs now, a man with a wood en leg. A New York State road in the same locality would have finished long ago the double track. No management but the pres ent one of the Western could have ever sat down, at the end of four year's war, waste and wear, io wait for freight cars to become cheaper before replenishing their rolling stock. There is yet another plan in discussion, for giving an enlarged Boston connection with the Grand Trunk Railroad of Canada, to send freight and travel through without the present Portland detour. This new line, by Conway, N. H., would stand to all other ex isting routes os the hypothcnusc to the two sides of a triangle. This connection is the more Important because,just.at this time, . the Grand Trank Is at work in earnest lor new connections with Chicago by the Port Huron and St. Joseph route across Michigan. But whatever way it is to be gained, and the more ways the better, Boston, by bestirring herself can meet her own ardent wishes con cerning Western trade and find the West, in Us eagerness for competing routes, quite as , ardent. We have written this in a kindly spirit, as kindly as that which has, la time past, helped Boston to do so much for the development of the West, In both cases a spirit of self-interest. . What the West needs now .is ample and numerous routes to the sea. She can fill them oIL Her trade leaves the region beyond the lakes in several great trunk lines, to which others ore to be added. Other dries, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, .have made straight and clear the path forfrclghtto thdr warehouses and docks. It Is only when freight reaches the New England railroad system that it finds itself straightened, sent -into circuit ous and .provoking roundabouts, or heaped for weeks in freight depots before it can be moved at all. It Is this that has given trade between Boston and the West congestive chills, and a six weeks congestion at Albany, not now ended, is a fresh but not unusual in stance of the distemper.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT HAILI7AY CONNECTION. Our readers may remember that English capitalists arc largely Interested In the rail way line running Northwest from St. Paulin the direction of Pembina. It is understood that they have a controlling interest in It, and in fact are furnishing the money to build it. Their object Is to reach the settlements of the Hudson Bay Company and ultimately to extend the road up the valley of the Laakat* chawan and across the Rocky Mr»nnt»>>n« to the Pacific. The long winter embargo upon the navigation of the Mississippi, and the low water often virtually stopping navigation for several weeks if not months during the sum mer, have induced these capitalists to under take the early contraction of the railroad down the Mississippi to Winona. An agree ment on the part of the Northwestern Rail way Company to have their line extended to Winona by the time the road from SU Paul should reach that city was signed a few days bincchy Hon. Wm. B. Ogden in New York. Thus anothermost important railway en terprise will be completed within a year or two. The English capitalists represented by C. J. Brydges, Esq., manager of the Grand Trunk Railway, Mr. Walkin, member of the British Parliament, and others,have an aban donee of capital to complete their part of the ecu tract as hist as it can be profitably done, and their immense interests In the Northwest w til urge them forward as rapidly as possible. The Northwestern road can, of course, do all it undertakes,and we may therefore now look fur the opening ofltslincto St. Paul and also to Omaha at an early day. We need not speculate upon the valnc of these lines to the business Intends of this city and of the entire Northwest. The subject has often been dis cussed in these columns, and onr readers can fully appreciate their innK)rtance. ITALY. The second Parliament of the kingdom of Italy has just been opened at Florence, by Motor Emanuel, in a speech In which be an nounces that all attempts to effect a recon ciliation with the Pope of Rome had failed, an announcement that was received with tre mendous cheering by the 450 deputies of the regenerated nation then present. They evi dently feared the evils of concession far more than tne lading terrorslof the expiring Papal power. The sovereign declared that “the people of Italy must rid themselves of such remnants of the past as hinder the plenary development of its new life,” and that “therefore the segregation of the church from the Stale and the abolition of religious cor-' potations have to be discussed.” This statement also was received with furious applause. At last, therefore, after fifteen centuries of Papal tyranny, the representa tives of rc-unlted Italy are assembled in the Hall ofthe Fire Hundred at Florence, the main question before. them being tbe sever ance of the Chorch from the Slate, through out that stronghold of priestly despotism. This necessarily includes the secularization of the property of the church, and its control by the State. Ultimately It tends to freedom of religious thought and to entire equality of sects, leaving each sect to be sup ported by the voluntary contributions of Its own adherents Instead ol by taxation. How soon the Italian revolution will extend to the Eternal City and oblige the Pope to confine himself to hb priestly functions while the people shhli govern the city and incorpo rate It Into the Italian Kingdom, remains to be seen. The work of Italian regeneration still goes on, though less rapidly than under the bold strides of Garibaldi and less vigor ously than when guided by the wisdom of Caronr. But if the separation of church and state and the abolition of religions corpora tions shall be accomplished by the present Parliament, Italy may be regarded as re deemed. The cold breath of winter has "suddenly smitten the habitations of the poor, and the prices of fuel aud provisions are so high that many ! families In the city ore not; only on the verge of suffering, but are actually In distress at this moment. -The poor we have always with us, but we have not always the biting frosts, the chilling blasts, the high prices, the scant resources of the present sea son. The cal! for public charity is pressing, and should be answered promptly and liber ally. The Citizens’ Belief Committe com mence their canvass of the city to-day to pro cure subscriptions for this purpose. • Let those who hove warm fires anu comfortable meals and happy homes, against which the blasts of December beat In vain, or only heighten their 'enjoyment, open their hearts and their purses to this appeal, remembering that he who glveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord. 

FROM TTASHDfGTON. CongreMand (be jßreatdent on Zlecon- Ktroctlon. [From our own Correspondent.) Wasotkotok, Dec. 9.1865. No question is more frequently and press ‘ugly asked here at this time than this: “Will there be any antagonism, likely to develop into serious difficulties between the President and the Republican majority of Congress.ln connection with the reconstruction ques tion?” The paragraph in the message, In which the Executive distinctly'refers'the sub ject ofthe admission of members elected for both houses from the rebel States to Con gress, and expresses his willingness to accept .its decision, is certainly-assuring. It should allay all public apprehensions on Ibis score at least for the present. It is true, that as Con gress is the proper end solo authority to pass upon this issue, the President deserves no particular credit for the part of the message referred to. Still it argues well for the future, that, although he Is anxious for on early, entire re-establishment of the seceded States >in the Union, by their representation in Con gress, bo docs not urge his wishes in this re !spcct upon the national legislature. Ills dis j position to leave the utmost freedom of ac tion to Congress in the premises Is farther provedby bis advice, given through the Pro visional Governors, to the members elect from the South, to stay at home until the question of Ibelr admission Is finally decided. This he did In order to save Congress from the em barrassment and pressure that would be ex perienced from the personal pressure is Wash ington of a hundred or so applicants for ad mission. But the admission of representatives from .the South Is only one of the easy subjects, bearing npon reconstruction, to be acted upon by Congress. The legal and political regula tion ofthe status of the freedmeu is another, In regird to which complete accord of the Executive and Congress can hardly be looked for. Yet the impression of the Republican members, who have discussed his reconstruc tion policy with the former since the opening of the session, is that he will not make a de cided issue with Congress in any event. It would hardly avail him much to do so. For, although there are in both Houses some mem bers elected os Republicans, that are ready to endorse all or most of tbe President's recon struction reasons, a careful canvass, has es tablished the fret, that they ore not numer ous enough to clog legislation in case of an open rupture between the President and the radical majority. THE 

HOUSE RESOLUTION FOR TUE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN. . The telegraph has informed yon of the Re publican Senatorial Caucus npon the Honse resolution for the Special Committee of fif teen. One of the principal objections raised hi the caucus against the House resolution was,, that, if passed in its original form, it wonld require the signature of the President to render It valid. However, by thesnbstltu tlon of a roneurrmf resolution, not requiring such signature, the Senate caucus does not intend to express a want of confidence in the President, though Us action Is liable to that construction.

MEXICAN EXPRESS COMPANY. * It will be remembered that during last spring certain enterprising Americans applied for and succeeded in obtaining permission from the Emperor Maximilian, to organize and operate an express company, on the American plan, from the United States to Mexico, and within the territory of the “Em pire.” If lam not mistaken, this company is one of the speculative concerns that M. Romeo, the Mexican Minister, officially de nounced some time ago, os hostile to the Juarez Government and the Interests of the Republicans in his country. Notwithstand ing M. Romeo's denunciation and warning to tbc public, the Mexican Express Company has been organized and commenced business- Its proprietors, with admirable shrewdness, have lately made a very liberal offer to Mr. Clarence Seward to enter tbclr service, and become connected with tbe management of the company. I understand now that the gentleman has accepted their proposition. That pecnlia- Inferences will be drawn from this (act, seems very natural. MB. SUMNER AND THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Senator Sumner was the least satisfied with the President's Message'among his colleagues. He intended to open upon that part of it relat ing to the reconstruction question. Immediate ly after It was read, bnt was persuaded to ab stain for the present from an arraignment of ,the "President's policy. He now'saysthat he regrets having yielded to tbe remonstrances of his tricods, and will in all probability em brace the opportunity offered by the discus sion ol the Honse resolutions for the Commit tee of Fifteen, to say what he meant to say last week.

THE LIST OF REBEL BOND HOLDERS SO. 2. The second list of the English holders of the rebel cotton loan,'printed In the New York papcis, was Tarnished, like the' first, to the associated, press by the State Department. It Is said, that it is the fruit of efforts made by our diplomatic agents In England and France since the correctness of the one printed some three months ago was disputed by Jmpli. catcd parties. OIL INTELLIGENCE. A 150»Barrel Well Struck at isotb* well, Canada, by « Chicago Company. A splendid “oil strike ” at Bothweli, Can ada West, deserves to be made public, as the lucky owners are all citizens of Chicago. A well located within two miles of the railroad station at Bothweli; is now yielding 180 tolso barrels per day, of on excellent quality of oil, which Is selling readily at the station for eleven dollars per barrel In gold, equal to six teen dollars In greenbacks. The Company pay the proprietor of the land a royalty of one-fifth of the product of the well; bat this leaves them a clear profit of. upwards ot sl,6ooper day in greenbacks! The history of this successful strike—the biggest yet made in Canada—is as follows: Last spring, after the war had closed, CapL Frank Lester, son of onr well known citizen M. W. Lcrtcr, Esq., manufacturer of . Lester’s popu lar house furnaces, concluded to examine the oil regions about Bothweli, In Canada, and see what chance there might be in the petro leum line, for on enterprising young man to earn an honest livelihood. A few weeks investigation satisfied him that the “surface indications’* would Justify the cost of looking under the “sand rock” for a deposit of the nnctuons field. .He found a piece of land that could be leased, on which was an aban doned well. It appears that a Scotchman, the year previous, had sank a well andetnxck oil, bnt he either had not bored quite deep enough or did not understand how to manage it. At all events, he allowed the well to cave In and fill up with sand for want of tubing. Bnt before it was ruined five or six barrels exuded from the month of the well and flowed into a hole dug to re* ceive it. But the Scotchman neglected the' well, and it filled up. His lease of the land from the owner soon afterwards expired, and his claim was at on end. It was this tract of ground that Captain Lester concluded to lease for a term of years. He wrote to his father to come there and see him about It. Mr. Lester was in no particular hurry how. ever, but at lost went over to Bothweli, and oftcra few days examination concluded to close the bargain, which required bnt a small cash payment, and a royalty of pnc-fiflh of the product of the wells that might be sunk on the land. A company was at once formed, consisting of himself, his bod. Captain Lester, his son-in law, A. W. Hall, of the Burlington Railroad, and another gentleman, working for the same company, whose name we forget. Captain Lester contracted with some Canadian parties to sink him a well, paying them so much a foot and a fair price for the engine and other improvements when the Job was completed. The work was commenced in August, and four weeks ago the sand pump brought up oil at the depth 0f237 feet. The well was sunk a few feet more and tubed, when a pump was put in and oil began to flow. The first day’s pomplng brought up thirty barrels. For the next week the oil obtained was Impure or “ sooty.” A fortnight ago this impure stuff was all pumped out, and the good oil was obtained In large quantities. The first day 130 barrels, the next ISO, the next 140, and ever since the average yield of the pump has been 130 to 140 barrels, although as high as 170 barrels were obtained In one day. There are no indications of exhaustion or decrease. The first week’s products sold at the station at eight, dollars per barrel in gold; the second week’s for ten; and lost week’s for eleven, which Is equivalent to sixteen dollars in American currency. The cost of trans porting the oil to the depot is hat thirty cents per barrel In coin, the distance being but two miles to haul it, aud the cost of working the pump and attending to the well is button dollars per day. The clear profits of the company amount to ten thousand dol lars per week. This well may be considered equal in value to a five hundred barrel well in Pithole, on account first, of the superior quality of the oil; second, of the high price petroleum commands in Canada; third, the exceeding cheapness of transportation from .the well to the depot—being but onc-tcnth as much as. the cost for hauling oil to the railroad from the Pithole wells; fourth, the freedom from taxation. The American wells must pay one dollar per barrel, while the Canadian wells pay nothing; however It Is expected that the Canadian Parliament will levy a tax this win ter on petroleum. The Lester Company are sinking two more wells on thdr property, feeling sangnlne that oil in profitable quantities will be obtained from both. The great luck of this Company will cause other Chicago Companies to bold up their heads and hope for “strikes” before Spring. A great deal of money has been ex pended by Chicago parties in purchasing leases and lands, and in boring for oil in the Bothwcll District, and thus tar the returns have been rather indifferent. But few of the wells have been sank to the proper depth, and better fortune may be in store to reward their enterprise and expenditure. It Is estimated that twelve hundred thou sand dollars in gold have been laid out by American parties daring the post six months, In the vicinity of Bothwell in search of petro leum. The Lester Company are getting back 100 per cent a week on their Investment- If the others do half as well, their, opera tions will prove quite remunerative. FBOM EUBOPE.

The New Vico President of the Board of Trade—The Question of Reform— Xbc Idoasacre of Nccroes In Jamaica —meeting of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Shareholders. [From Onr Own Correspondent.) Losdon, Nov. 25. THE NEW MINISTERIAL APPOINTMENTS. If we may judge by the changes made In onr cabinet since the death of Lord Palmer ston, Earl Rnssell Is honestly bent upon the In traduction of a genuine reform bill, that is in'other words, of a considerable extension of ibe suffrage. The real Liberals of this country were at first frightened by the ex-cathedra as sertions of such aristocratic organs of the press as the TimMand Morning Post, and looked for the entrance upon office of Messrs. Lowe, Horeman and others wbo, during so many years, had been the ready and willing tools of Palmerston in strangling reform ; but tbc result thus for, ‘has caused an agreeable surprise to the country. The most notable addition Is the appointment of Mr. Goschen, one of tbc members of the city of London, to the office of Vice President of the Board of Trade, a position for which he Is especially sailed by his know ledge of commercial affairs and his writings on financial not for thesealime. Mr. Goschen Is new.vexynewj to public life. He entered Parliament only two years ago os one of the four members for the city of London, and during the short period he has sat In the House of Commons has so satisfied onr bankers and merchants of his legislative ability that, at the last general election, be was returned at tbc head of the polls. He is only thirty-four years of age, and it Is no small proof of his talents and standing in the community that after two short years of public life, he should be offer ed on important position In the Government. Mr. Goscbcn has no aristocratic connections; he Is a man of the people and a consistent, outspoken Reformer. . Ills appointment is a pledge to our country and the world at largo that the administration Is determined upon a policy of peace, retrenchment and economy, and has given Earl Russell a renewed popu larity and great Increase of confidence which must greatly strengthen the ministry, for Mr. Goschen possesses the foil confidence of our manufacturing, trading, commercial and financial classes. The next chance on the slate is the substi tution of ilr. Chichester Fortcscue for Sir Robert Peel as Secretary of State for Ireland. This Is killing two birds with one stone, for It gets rid of a bad officer and gives us tne In fluence of a good one. Sir Robert Peel could not possibly have been put into a more un likely position than that of Irish Secretary. Bh Is onr George Francis Train, a capital speaker, lull of wit and anecdote, dashing, smashing, crashing generally; but ho Is also vain, hot-headed and tyrannical; and, there fore, a most unlikely man for Ireland where conciliation is tbc only proper policy. Tbe Irish bate him, for he has snubbed their lead ing men continually; until our press gener ally bos been compelled to assert In speaking of uls late office, Inal any change must be for the better. Mr. Chichester a young man, is an experienced public func tionary. He vacates tbc office of Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, which he has held since 1857, (with an intermission of only a few months,) during which time he. has earned golden opinions by his official management and his ability in the House of Commons. Moreover, he Is an Irishman, and his appoint ment, therefore, to the Irish Secretaryship mayjproperly be regarded as an evidence of tbc Government's desire to pacify the sister kingdom, and to remove those objections which were inseparable from the tenure of that office by his obnoxious predecessor. The appointment Is a good one, but I do not put n as equally good with that of Mr. Goschen. Mr. Forcstcue Is on aristocrat by birth and position; he is the fourth husband of the Countess of TYaldcgrarc, one of the leading members of the nobility and fashion ; ana his rise Is very greatly due to tbe necessity ot paying some court to her ladyship's class and connections. Still It Is a good appointment, .and will immediately strengthen Earl Rus sell's administration. Those two appointments arc‘taken from what I should tenue the upper and middle class of the Liberal party. A third office Is given to a representative of the “radicals,*’ or lower class, m the person of Mr. William E. Forster, the member for Bradford. It is almost superfluous lor mo to inform your readers of the antecedents of this gentleman, for next to John Bright and the lamented Richard Cobden, there has been no man in England who has stood op so bravely and so wisely for the North and against tne slare power as Mr- Forster. He has good, sound blood in his Veins, for bis fatherwas a mem ber of-the Society of Friends .during fifty years and died on on anti-slavery mission In yonrState of Tennessee. Next to Mr. Bright, be stands the foremost man in our real liberal party: and Earl Russell performs a worthy and wise act In offering him the Under Secre taryship of State for the Colonics. Such an appointment is particularly good at the present time,' when the remnant of oar old Slavcocracy in the West Indies is seeking to reduce the colored population to their former condition of servitude: and it leads us to anticipate, moreover, that the Government is seriously preparing for a great advance in freedom both In our colonics and at home. -, Wcare led by Mr. Forster’s appointment to look for Mr. Bright’s acceptance of office; and the fact of the aristocratic organs of the press attacking him almost dally forces us to Infer that such an offer wUI be made, U it has not been made already. 1 have no information, os yet, in reference to tliiff point; and I believe nothing will be known definitely about it until the turn of the new year. This much, however, is apparent: Earl .Bussell has not placed him in the.. hands of your enemies, but is courting the eld of your friends; and your readers may anticipate with reasona ble confidence that every trouble affecting the relations of our two countries will ultimately be settled to the satisfaction of both parties concerned. lam qoitc confident that Messrs. Groschcn and Forster would not have accept ed officcunder anything short of this under standing; and that Mr. Bright would not show himself so friendly to the Government unless he knew that the policy maintained by Lord Palmerston toward the United States would be pacifically modlfledby his successor. 

AFFAIRS IN JAMAICA. ' The ruthless massacre of the negroes in Ja i maica is stirring up the minds of Englishmen .to an unwonted degree, notwithstanding the ; diabolical efforts of such papers as the Times, Morning Pott, Herald and Standard to seduce ■ public opinion to the side of the tyrannical planters. You ore so mnch nearer than our selves to tho West Indies, that it would be useless for me to attempt any information as to what Is transpiring in that much belied colony of Jamaica; but I can give your read ers certain facts in regard to the negro popu lation there which will be useful to them when discussing tho question of negro suf frage. We made labor free by our act of eman cipation, but tee did not free the laborert. You do not free any men whom yon keep in an in ferior position, whom you allow to be lega ted for by a proud and wealthy minority, and whom you force to obey laws by the strong arm of authority, without permitting them to have any voice in the framing of those laws When our land owners, planters and agents In Jamaica found themselves deprived of the coercive power of .slavery, they resolved to evade the laws by importing coolie laborers to work their plantations. This system bos existed in full force for many years past, some of the first men In onr Parliament and aris tocracy being shareholders in the system of coolie importation, a system which is nothing else than slavery under a now form. v Thc ne groes in Jamaica arc driven from off the land; they are despised, hated and wronged by their proud white lords, and it is not in human nature—white or black—to stand that. Talk about atrocities; why there arc no people under heaven who have to answer for more cold-blooded cruelty and fsr-rcach ing tyranny than my own countrymen; and It comes with bad grace from us to speak of the barbarism of the negro, whom formerly we whipped and now shoot in cold blood. Now, ifyour Southern States copy the exam ple of England in reference to tho colored people of the erst rebellions “Dixie,” they must have the same results. If thev cannot force them to work on the plantations on their own terms, they (the planters,) will do the same as ours in Jamaica. They will Import their labor from Europe and elsewhere; but at the same time, they will have a constantly increasing black population ever ready for deeds of vio lence and bloodshed. Your planters cannot stndy the island of Jamaica too closely. It seems almost as though Providence had set down that bland near your coast that you ml"ht take warning from tho evils which curse her. Your act of Emancipation of to day is no better, no fuller, than ours of years gone bye; onrs n** foiled lamentably because ft has not done full and . complete Justice. Will your short sighted conservatives doom their country to be a magnified and intensified Jamaica I 1 believe not, emphatically not. Your late elections satisiy us here that Amer ica is honestly bent upon freedom to all; and you are evidently too clear-sighted, too logi cal, to allow any remnants to exist of that old slave-power which has caused the mightiest convulsions of modem times. THE ATLANTIC AND GREAT WESTERN RAIL- ROAD. I attended the meeting of the shareholders of the above company last Thursday alter noon, and now feel more than ever satisfied that the relations of our two countries arc on a secure and friendly bads. Some four or five hundred of the leading capitalists and business men of this Metropolis were gathered together in the large hall of the London Tavern, and no better representative man could have been placed in the chair than Sir Morton Pcto. Those of your readers who bold stock In the Atlantic & Great Western Railroad, will be more likely to seek for in formation upon their concern from the official reports of tue company than from anything I cod coy to them; but I moy at on oTcnfa bo permitted to testify as to the tone perrading the meeting, and the potato in the speakers’ remarks which particularly interested me. Every man who addressed the meetin". and they were an Englishmen, was most laudato ry of your country, and accrued to strneelo to find expressions • of commendation for your ncspitality, your prospects and resources. Mr. Forbes, the chairman of one of our principal continental railroads, called particular attention to the wonderful resources of your Western Stales, telllne his hearers that Ohio alone had a (treater aiSvial area than thowholo of the United Kingdom. Another speaker advised his audience to ducc emigrants to seek your country in preference to NewZcsland and other of onr colonies; and athlrJ Interested the meeting highly-by reading a number of statistics besr ing upon your produce, which most present evidently thought somewhst romantic. I in formed yon in my last letter that onr opta . radl “ ll f, - changing towards the United States, and since attending thla meet ing I- am more than eyer eatlsiledofthe fact. Onr commercial claascs dnnng the late con test were generally on Iho side of the rebel lion, hnt all that feeling Is now changed: and this meettagof the Atlantic .fcGreaitWckern Eallroad is.wlthontdonhl, the turning point in the relations of the two countries. The only stumbling block In the way ol onr complete friendship, is the liabilities'of certata S6uth era States; for those liabilities cause distrust amongst bur capitalists, who would otherwise regard America os the most remunerative field for investment. Were some satisfactory ar rangement entered into without delay, such an one na was lately proposed by onr commit tee of Southern bondholders, you would •shortly have an influx of capital Into the United States unprecedented in the history of any country. Our business men arc looting westward, but they are terribly afraid of State repudiation. John Bonn, Jc. 

FROM BELCIV7T. Health of Kins Leopold—Political and Leghdalive Affair*—A Petition for . Permission to Aid IQaxlmlllau—Mex ican News Tb roach Bclglc Channels —Statistics or Journalism Abroad. ' [Correspondence of the Chicago Tribune.] Bbcssels, Nov. 28,18G5. i The great preoccupying care of our people is the state of health of our dear monarch. Sad rumors arc again in circulation and the the Queen of England has sent her first phy sician to Ardennes (tbe hunting palace of the King) to consult Leopold and his physicians about the now relapse, which wo hope will he of not very great severity. King Leopold who is known to be, after his son, the Count of Flanders, the first hunter in Europe, had been, through his two.years 1 sickness,dc. prived of the sports of the field. This year, having been rather better during tbe summer and trusting too much In the strength of his constitution, he would not listen to the pre scriptions of his physicians, who begged him to keep as quiet as possible, but left last week for his hunting seat in the forest of Ardennes. It is the over-fatigue of that journey which was tbe cause of tbo. relapse. | Tbe trip of the King has been taken by the Conservative party as a political play, show ing to tbe country that Leopold la in opposi tion to tbe Liberals, representing a majority of the people, and that his intention was to be absent, so that he need not make a speech from the throne. But this was not the case ; and to prove U, it can he stated that a royal nomination has keen given In Ardennes, by which Mr. Jnles Bara, one of the warmest parthans of the actual ministry and a mem ber of the majority, has been appointed Min ister (Secretary) of Justice in the place of Mr. Zesch, whose resignation has been accepted. The nomination of Mr.' Bora is a proof that Leopold is always the same intelligent King, moving with the party who has the confidence of the country, and knows perfectly well what choice to make in the moment when difficulties are thick about him. Onr new Sec retary is the most bitter enemy of the two extremes—the Red Republicans and the Black Conservators. Ho is one of those who wish to follow the progresses of the times with an as sured step and withont fear of political and financial troubles. I The day ensuing the appointment of Mr. Bora was the legal opening of the legislative session of 1865-46. One of the first objects on the order was a petition of a great number of subaltern officers and soldiers of our army, asking permission to leave tbe ranks.to go to Mexico to defend there the cause of Maxi milian. ITbe discussion was brief, os tbe country in general had given her voice against the intervention. One of lh« deputies wrtipdaeu to lay the petition on the taole, but onr Secretary of Foreign Afi'aly® Mr. Charles sojw, »uat IhlswoulS be a censure addressed to the signers of the petition, and that be thought that - there could be no fault In the love of the children of the country lor the daughter of our mon arch. The Chamber accented the idea of the government, and the first proposition was re jected, and another to refer the petition to the Bureau of Information has beeu accepted, i TheS last mail from Mexico brought us the information of a new victory of the Bel gian corps, 200 soldiers of the Princess Char lotte Legion having defeated the corps of Gen. Diaz, composed of 2,600 men. Porforlo Diaz, who was a prisoner in the hands of the Imperialists and who escaped a few months ago, tried to take tbe city of Morelia duriogthe absence of Col. Vandcr missen of the Belgian cavalry. • The absence of the chief gave hope to the Jaarists that the rcelstoucc would not be as energetic, and tbe absence of the cavalry assured them in alt cate a retreat without having to fear a pur suit. On tbe 12th of October, In the after noon, tbe attack took place. Through the carelessness of tbe authorities nobody sus pected the presence in the vicinity of more than 2,000 enemies, nearly all on horse. The parllas of the city were guarded only by the avant posts, composed of a few soldiers who understood that Instead of falling back they bad to keep the positions as long as possible to prevent the surprise of the gairison. They fell nearly all on the place of honor, but the Juartsts lust nearly three hours time, and when they entered into tbe city the resistance was organized on all points.' During two iCwFfc Diaz tried to find a vulnerable aide by .which uC conld bo able to expel the Belgians, but bis attempts‘Were all - counteracted and finally be was obliged to fall back. ; This and a fewlelters written by tbe heroes of Eacambnro and Loma to their families are the only news we have received frpm Mexico since my lost correspondence. Our liberal population hope that thelegis latirescselou of the United States, which will be assembled very soon, will order President Johnson to accept a more energetic policy in tbe Mexican question. i The declaration of the closing of the ports of Chill by the Spanish Admiral Poreja has produced here the greatest excitement. The liberals of Europe sec. in It a now attack on their principles. I believe that the governments of Emopo will oblige the Cabinet of Madrid to recall Perula, and to arrance the compli cation with Chill without the interference of war. The Chamber of Commerce of Bruasclls (an official institution,) has invited the members of the other chambers of‘he kingdom to have a re-onion to discuss what is to be done in the Chilian case. ; In finishing, I will communicate to your readers some very interesting statistics. In the year 1804, Belgium, with a population of nearly 5,000,000 ot inhabitants, amfon area of 12,000 square miles, possessed 318 newspapers. Brussels alone has more than GO publications: dally 125,000 to 150,000 Journals are sent to the provinces and foreign countries by the post-office at our capital, and over 100,000 by the different offices of the provinces, so that we have at least 225,000 gazettes leaving daily tbe cities of publication, or 81,000,000 ayear; and il wo odd on that sum tbe 20,000,d00 of periodical publications, we arrive at an ag gregate total of 100,000,000, or 200,000 reams of Paper, IbercamcontalnlngSOOshcete. Alter .Belgium, where through the great liberty of the press the greatest number of journals arc published, comes the United States, then •England, France, etc, It has been remarked, andf sustained by my investigations on the subject, that the movement of journalism Is nlwaysln proportion to the liberty of each ,conntry. In Switzerland, indeed, the press has not the importance the political constitu tion of the country (republic) seems to assign her, bnt the canae of it Is that in Switzerland great apparent liberty veils a great nnmber of little servitudes.

PROM ITALY. Opening of tbo Italian Parliament—A ■ Travelling Capital—Coming to Borne Victor Emanuel on Debt and Taxes— The Pope, and the Austrian Question . —Financial Matters—The Cholera at Naples. (Correspondence Chicago Tribune.) Flouesce, Italy, Nov. 23. OPENING OP PARLIAMENT. The opening of the Second Italian Par liament on Saturday last was a brilliant spec tacle. The Florentines had an opportunity of contrasting favorably their new position as the Capital of the whole Peninusula with that doubtful honor which accrues to them as the chief city of a Grand Duchy. These crowds of deputies, senators, generals, am bassadors, and prefects moke a flue picture of national strength which they represent. But ;forall that we are not too happy. The Capi tal has spoiled us, and made our cheap, hap ,py home a new and expensive Florence. A CAPITAL OX ITS TRAVELS. | Temporary capitals will be the death of us. Turin built one, enlarged as If the capital •were a permanent Institution, and the Gov ernment encouraged the delusion by spending :large sums in public works. The ministry' ■was enlarging and repairing the Chamber of : Deputies, at tnemoment when they announced ;that they had decided to remove to Florence ; six months before. Florence is declared another temporary .capital, hut the Government builds and en larges as If It Intended to slay hero forever. : The people sec what the Government is doing, : and imitate it. In fact It would be Impossi ble to convince a Florentine that the capital jWlll ever go to Borne. Perhaps It will not; but it Is very certain that nobody knows, and (the ministry Is just as ignorant as tbe rest of ns. The force of events and tbe will of the { ltalian people must be left to settle that ques , tiou, and what ephemeral ministries think is 'of little moment. Tbe people want to go to Rome, and they may yet befavoredby events. THE KING’S ADDRESS. The discourse of tbe Crown Is, like other doc uments of Its kind, rather vogue and high sounding. Still there are some very clear and precise sentences. One of them assures ns that we are in debt and must pay more taxes. We knew it before, but the endorsement of the fact by the King may sweeten the un pleasant truth forborne of us. Another tells us that the ncgoUaUous with the Roman Court failed because they could not be suc cessfully carried on, and the Pope required a sacrifice of our national honor. We knew that, too, but many of us believed that our honor suffered a little in the undertaking of negotiations at all. Wc do not recognize a King In Rome anymore than you did a Presi dent in Richmond: but treating with the Pope Implied as sort of recognition. 1 The address further informs us, in a vogue way, that we should be ready for a fight with Austria. This falls la with a remark of the Ring at Naples, the other day. He told a committee of operatives that; we could only go to Venice by bloodshed, and that he was ready to sacrifice his own life lu the conflict. Wo bear that this language has evoked diplo matic necstions at Paris, Berne and "Florence. This miiht look as If a war were really brow ing ; bu; there is no other sign of It in all Eu rope, sad I attach no Importance to theso royal declarations except as they Indicate that Victor Emanuel Is just as Impatient as bis people over the equivocal position in which the French and Austrian occupations place us. ' • • . ‘ <nr« vrVlvria The finance question Is the mosfcserious one to come before the new Parliament. We pay forty millions of dollars per annum for Inter est upon our public debt, and the greater part of this sum goes out of tbe country. Wo have two immense armies, both of which are idle consumers. Tbe soldiers are the heavier drain, but the civil employes provoke our Im patience as well as exhaust our money. Ido not suppose that -your Washington bureaus are models for a businessman; bat it is safe to say that ten men are employed at Florence to do what one does at Washington.' It is true wc pay small salaries, bat thcnoarclerks live, and their deficits are in some way eked out of our pockets. Men will not starve when their noses arc so near the public crib. It is curious, however, that while every one clamors for a reduction of the civil army, nobody is agreed with any other body as to irhere tbe cupping off of heads should begin. If It is reported that a- minister has resolved to diminish the force in a eeitaln bureau, there Is at once a cry of pain la half tbe Jour nals. It is demonstrated over and over again that these poor clerks will bo houseless and homeless if turned oat of office. 'Should tbe minister try another bureau, the same protest would din his cars. It is a little funny to read in one colnmn of a newspaper a philliplc against the extravagance o! the civil list, and in another column a demonstration that A, B and C, clerks In a particular bureau, have a right to live at tbo public expense. A KEW TAX OK BREAD. The Minister of Finance proposes to levy a new tax. It Is to be paid by the millers, and is a capital invention for getting a chip from every slice of bread eaten In the Kingdom. It is an old and favorite tax in Italy. In tbe first place, it is sure. The millers take the tax out of the consumers, and have no Inter est in fraud, and, besides, can be easily watched. It is not like a high tariff on silk, which would lead people to wear calico; everybody will eat just as much bread as If there were no tax. Then it bears equally on everybody—a’poor roan will pay just as much as a rich one—and that commends it to our rulers. The rich make a noise when they are taxed; the multitude arc voiceless and do not elect deputies or edit newspapers. Id most countries, finance ministers try to get taxes from those who are best able to pay them; the traditional system here reverses the rule, and the mill era’ tax is pre-eminently a tradi tional one. ; In all our cllics, local government is chiefly supported on this some principle. A tax is levied at the gates on all the staple articles of Ibod, and each citizen pays taxes according to the size of bis stomach and not according to the length of his nurse. This oilroi system Is a relic of the middle ages and the millers 1 tax is a twin brother. There will be o fierce opposition in-Parlia ment ; but 1 think It will bo enacted. We cannot agree to save money by reducing ex penses ; wc must levy more taxes to put a stop to the increase of the public debt, t The discourse of tbe Crown further informs ns that wo arc to take possession of the ec clesiastical property and assume the colonies of onr priests. This Is the best part ot tbe address; for it indicates that the Roman negotiations arc really ended for the present, ana that wc arc disposed to manage our affairs without too much help from Pom. In May last tbo church confiscation or ap propriation law was withdrawn from Parlia ment to gratily a pious desire of Louis Napo leon /or an effort at reconciliation between Rome and Italy. The return to appropria tion b a good sign. • Portentous despatches have filled the airfor a week. “ A great reduction of the French army is to take place. 11 The mountain has bronchi forth its mouse, and we ore now in formed that the French army for IS£6 will consist of leu thousand less men than it has at present! If that does not secure (bo peace of Europe somebody must be 44 spoiling for a fight.” THE CHOLERA. Cholera continues at Naples. There has ' been an Increase during tbe past week, and 1100 cases are reported as having been devel oped, In and around the city, yesterday. This Is a small number for a population of half a million, but it is rather remarkable that the disease should present tbe character of an epidemic so late in tbe year, Speuo. KEKTyCKY

(From Oar Own Correspondent] KBAJiEroiTT, Ky.. Dec. 8, 1863, the legislator*. . The Legislature of our State convened in this city on Monday last. The Conservative party, having a large majority in both Houses, were very much troubled with numerous and sundry “martyrs for the cause,” in the per sons of anxious office-seekers; and yon would have thought, from the earnest and persistent efforts made by each candidate, that tbe whole success of the party was owing to each one’s self-sacrificing devotion “to the cause of Conservatism.” The great (?) party, which is made up of the “odds and ends of all creation,” who, for the sake of office, have combined together, was very uneasy as the time for the “ caucus” drew near, and whis pci s were heard from every side that concessions would have to be made by some of the discordant elements m order to secure the “spoils.” But those' of ns who have watched the course of this party, had no such Idea as that there would be any very serious-trouble, although we knew that the rebel element was very bold and defiant, and were demanding that they should have the lead in arranging affairs. We knew that the spoils—the “loaves and fishes of office ’’—would have a very harmonizing effect upon the party, whenever It got into Us icccet conclave; and that, however much (hey might quarrel aud bluster outside, os loon as the doors were closed there would be a balm shed abroad that would heal every breach. Aud so It proved; for, so soon as they were in caucus, they became “perfectly satisfied that whatever was done was lust the thing.” They therefore made all their nomi nations, and of course elected their nominees. And, 1o! and behold, the rebel element was only permitted to have one representative in the offices of each House, viz.; the assistant clerk of the House and the doorkeeper of tbe Senate. The rebels growled and grumbled, but have commenced consoling themselves with the Idea that they will have hotter luck next time, and secure to their share the elec tion of a United States Senator, in the person of the Hon. Lazarus W. Powell. TQB SENATORS HIP. ' And, speaking of a United States Senator, I will remark that it seems as though several gentlemen would be willing to undergo mar tyrdom if they could but secure so desirable a prize. The candidates arc "as thick as hops.” Among the most prominent are the Hon. Garrett Davis, Hon. Lazarus W. Powell, Hon. Robert Mallory. Hon. Joshua F. Bell. Hon. David Mariweatbcr, Lieut. Got. R. T. Jacob, Col. Frank L. Wolford, Hon. John M. Harlan, Hon. W. H. Wadsworth, Hon. Aaron O. Harding, and a long list of others “ too numerous to mention.” The Hon. Garrett Davis is very destrou* of being ‘‘indorsed by his State,” |and is doing everything ini his {tower to secure that end. And each one be ieves that be alone coaid represent the dear people just as they desire to be represented. Each one has his warm partisans who arc equally of the opinion of their principals, and so there Is a continual state of feverish excitement kept up among the brethren.” Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau was some time since nominated as the Union candidate, and the Union men -will vote for him In a body,- not with any hope, however, of electing Mm. He Is too true a patriot to suit Conservative taste, and they win never consent to see him a Sen ator from Kentucky by their assistance. The election Is set. by law, lor the Sth day of the session, which would he next Tuesday, the 12th Inst., bat the Conservatives have deter mined not to go Into the election until some lime in January, If then. TOE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. : The Governor’s Message, which Is a very able paper, presents the financial affairs of the Slate as In a very favorable condition. The State debt in 1859 was some 15,479,244. After expending 13,268,234 duringthe war (a part of which has been refunded by tbe Gov ernment.) her debt is now only some $5,254.- 340. Showing a redaction of some $200,000 in the debt,notwithstanding the large amount expended for the support of the war. The State has also furnished ont of an enrolled militia, white and colored, of 133,493—50 me 63,075 white soldiers, and 20,438 colored soldiers, making an aggregate of 84,413, which 4s a very fair record for a State which has been environed with as many troubles as she has, and particularly with slavery to contend 'against. A DIGRESSION, j And now for an explanation of onefact. and jthat is in regard to the unconditional Union tvotc of last August. The returns show that there were some 42,800 and upward votes n"cd for the amendment. Those votes were ved, in a great measure, from the soldiers who hadjnst been mustered out and arrived at ,homc. The balance of the 63.975 white sol diers were cither dead or (with some excep tions) had removed from tho State. Very few of tho soldiers from Kentucky voted against that, amendment. TUB CONSTITUTION AX AMENDMENT. j But, to return from this digression, the Gov ernor again urges upon the Legislature the im portance and even necessity, for Kentucky to adopt the Constitutional Amendment, and thus range herself with those States who have hot been asleep os to the mighty strides taken by the car of progress. ’ SOLDIERS' COMB. ! lie urges tbe purchase of a home for dis abled soldiers of Kentucky, and suggests the “Harrodsburg Home," now owned by the Government, as the most suitable place. XEGRO SUFFRAGE. ! He opposes negro suffrage on the ground of the reserved right of a State to prescribe the qualification or Its own voters. He favors an amendment of oar code o! laws to moke them 'suitable to the new exigencies of the times. TUB POLITICAL ASPECT. The plans of the Conservatives hare hardly ' unfolded themselves sufficiently to allow any . one to judge of them with any certain degree 'of accuracy. But enough la known to enable me to say that they have determined to va cate the seals of every Union man that there is the slightest ground upon which to base a charge^oT“military Interference.” Buttbelr : triumph will be but short-lived, for these gentlemen will be returned to their places by Increased majorities. THE PUBLIC DECT. From indications I am Inclined to believe that they will favor, cautiously at first, the repudiation of the public debt. JEFF DAYIS.

FEOM ST, LOUIS. Pawoffß of (be Beslttry law by both *Branchc« of tbe Legislature— Inci dent* of tbe Struggle—Stale KCallroad Topics. [Correspondence of the Chicago Trftmoe.l - Sr. Loaa, Deo. n. ' The Registry Law passed the Senate yester day. It Is the law called for by the now con stitution, and which had previously passed the lower House. It went through that body a tew days ago like a sky-rocket. The bill was previously discussed In a Radical caucus and perfected to suit the views of tbe Radi cals, and then suddenly sprung In tbe House as a substitute for tbe original bill drawn bv Hon.C.D.D.Valk.oftbiscUy. Tbe Conserva tives were struck dumb. They only number ed a handful! nil told, and could not muster - either courage enough or tact enough to make .a decent fight. A half dozen resolute men could have worried the House terribly before tbo passage of such a bill, bit the Con servatives In this bad neither pluck nor parliamentary skill equal to the emergency. They were graciously allowed the privilege of offering a few 'amendments all of which were speedily voted down, and finally the inevitable tyrannous previous question was ordered. Tbe hill passed a first and second reading. Then tbe Conservatives breathed freer and among themselves thought tbe Radicals had gone as far os they desired that day. They were accordingly speechless with astonishment, when a Radical moved to frirtber suspend the rules andpass the bill to Us third and final reading. The votes in the House nearly all stood about 90 to 20. and only three or four pretended Radicals finally voted in tbe negative. A preliminary skir mish took place on the question in the senate on Friday and revealed the strength ot the Radicals in that body, to be more than suffi cient to carry It through whenever desired. Tbo biU was therefore made the special order for to-day, and passed with a rush, the Conservatives being very blue because they could not stave it off longer. This registry bill is in effect a bill to pre vent perjured rebels from voting. Its main features are just tbe same as the New York registry law, but the additional clauses are fn accordance with tbe terms of the new con stitution, requiring all voters to take the test oath. The boards of registry are to bo ap pointed by the Governor and the county courts. Tbe taking of the test oath docs not prima facie entitle a man to the right to have bis name registered, but no man can vote whose name Is not registered. Any voter can challenge the right to register on any ground, including that of disloyally. There is some doubt about the ability of the boards to take testimony upon a question of loyalty In such a manner as to do exact Justice to a man wrongfully charged with disloyalty. The time allowed for regis tering is too snort togive theßegistryßoards time to go Into on investigation. But the whole thing is an experiment, and may require and probably wUI require additional legisla tion ncrcaflcr to make It perfect. The rebel sympathizers are more effectually excluded from the elective franchise under this system than by any which bos been tried or pat into practice during tbo rebellion. They must not only swear themselves loyal, bat prove U. Perhaps tbo most arbitrary feature of tills stringent law is the power given to the Boards to refase to register upon facts within their own knowledge. RAILROAD HATTERS. ! The sale of the Southwest Branch or the Pacific railroad Is not opposed by the railroad company, ns many supposed It wonld he. On the contrary, the company was rather desirous than otherwise to get the rood off their hands, as It docs not now pay running expenses, and they have derived all possible benefit from the several million acres of land pledircd to < the road in the Southwest by. mortgaging the same to obtoin funds for building the main line for the sum of 110,000,000. The Fremont party was identical with the Dickinson party lately mentioned, and itls said they {bond the affairs of the road In such shape that they ore disinclined now to purchase. This was to be the first link in the grand road lately talked so much about to go through to Texas. A bill has passed one branch of the Legislature already for the appointment of a commission to sell this road and make a contract with the Pacific Railroad Company to run the trains from the junction of the Southwest Branch to this city. The Missouri Pacific Railroad Is an 0 _ lehiog success thus early in the hlstor* n f«»« compjetlm.

The road now building between Kansas SllT and - rxi en£ \on. of the main raclfic to Topeka, are unportont feeders for this road. In the spring three trains a day will be run each way. both making close con* ncctlons eastward—thus spoiling the placards circulated in St. Joseph by the Chicago, Bur* llugtou & Quincy road, that passengers for the East via St. Louis have to lie over oil night.

The Counterfeit One Hundred Dollar Compound Interest-Bearing Notes. | From tbe New Vork Herald, 10th.] It Is stated in a Washington despatch a few days since, that there was reason to believe (bat the government authorities had been successful In ferreting out and securing the original plates from which the celebrated counterfeit one hundred dollar interest-bear ing notes—seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars of which are now in circulation —were Srinted. and that tbe authors of this stupen ous scheme to defraud the Treasury of tbe country were well known, and would soon be arrested and receive tbeir well merited reward. Subsequent examination, in this city and Brooklyn, bos resulted in confirma tion of this supposition. . An officer of the Department came to New Torklastweekto see what had been done and was about to be done in regard to the case. This officer was Edward Jourdan, Solicitor of tbe Treasury. He held a secret session of detectives at tbe office of a well known law firm on Nassau street, where he had Mr. R. R. Lowell, the Chief of the New York force, before him, with several others, and a lengthy and critical examination of the wonderful fraud was entered into. He was welt satisfied that Mr. Lowell had done well, with the counterfeiters In this vicinity. Itls cow * thought that one result of this interview was the capture of the plates, paper, ink, presses and machinery ol the opera tors and its transfer to Washington, never again to be used by illegal manufacturers of paper currency. The property, it is under sicod, was round in the city of Brooklyn. Tbe principal actor in the preparation of the plate, and tbe one who worked directly upon the Treasury Department at Washington, nias probably made his escape from aB terrestrial punishment. He wossuddcnly attacked with a virulent disease, which ended his life ere be conld be brought to trial, and even before he was snspcctcu of his crime. All the parties concerned In the crime are known to the de tectives, and will soon be brought before the proper tribunals for trial. An interesting history Is connected with the Slate from which the backs of these one bun red dollar notes are printed. It cannot all be given at present, hut will'bo tmreDed be fore the courts. It is sufficient to say that a former employee of tbe department was se duced by the counterfeiters, and became their most efficient ally and confederate. It was through his agency and that of a wo man who figures somewhat in the affair, that the successful Imitation of the bock of tbe bill was accomplished. Some of the most skilful engravers in the country were engaged In producing the plate for tho face of the note, which, with only one or two very Im ?ortont variations, was also a copy of the rcusury Department’s genuine article. Then the new banking institution went into opera tion, and for a while did a thriving business. The result, os has been stated, was the issue of seven hundred and filly thousand dollars In the new currency before the trick was dis covered and the game exploded. ILLINOIS ITEMS. The Quincy Whig gives details of a most distract ing suicide which occurred in that city on Tuesday, Mrß.Fage, adanebterofMaj. Gen. Ben. M. Pren tiss, while at the bouse of ber father on the morn ing of that day, appeared rums daily downcast and sad. She finally told some of the people In the boose that she was going into the bach yard, and that they need not look for her soon. Before leav ing, she took the precaution to draw down the win dow certain near the door when she went out. As she passed a colored woman In the hack yard, she told her that she was going to make way wlthher- EClf, and left directions for her burial. The colored woman supposed she was joking, and took no no tice of It. The lady not retiming for some time, search was instituted, when her lifeless body was found In a cistern scar tbe stable. No reason Is as ‘signed tor the melancholy act. Tbe Cairo Democrat claims that W. H. Green’s majority for Circuit Judge Is about 1,030. Wc leant from tbe Peoria ITatlonal Democrat that bn Snnday night Mr. Towers, keeper of tbo county jail In that dty, heard a blow upon the sash of tbe window of the jail. Be seized a revolver as speedily as possible and opened the back door of the kitchen. As * the door opened, three men were presented to view, one of whom' made a rush for him and presented a re volver, which missed fire. Hr. Towers fired on the instant, when the assailant fell, and sbonted umnr der.” In the meantime Mr. Towers, thinking be bad“Bared”lhe first, sent a couple of shots alter" the others, hut probably missed them, and they pasted out by tbe front gate. ■ On' turning for tbe wounded one, he was going over the fence in the rear of the iai), and there were half'adozenmore 'on the outside who seemed to be accomplices, bnt .they all scattered. Soon after another was found 'in the yard by tbe watchman of tbe Jail, hot he got off without Injury, although some shots were fired at him. . ■\Ve learn from the Belvldera AdtfrtUer that while a little dsaghter of <l. Bigelow,, and another little girl nameo Mary Styles were playing on the Ice on tbe river, they broke through holding each other by the band. The water was about ten feet deep. Hr. George Tattle, who was near at band, eaw the occurrence, dashed Into the water and suc ceeded In rescuing the Styles girl, bat the other ’sunk, and her body was not recovered until an hour after. Daring Burglary—An Iron Safe' Car ried off. [From the St. Louis Democrat, lltb.J One of the most daring robberies that has come to our notice for a long time, was com mitted on Saturday night between seven and Tiinw o'clock. Ignatz Weckerman keeps a saloon and boarding house on Morgan street, between Fourth ana Fifth, and Is In the habit of receiving from bis boarders and transient customers such valuables as they wish to de posit for safe keeping. He had a small iron safe In his bed-room, over the bar-room, • which was chained to the floor to prevent re moval. The bed-room was always kept lock ed, and was considered secure from burglars. In tbts safe Mr. 'Weckerman had some 17,000 in money, besides valuable papers worth $2,000 more. Of this sum. about $3,000 be longed to Mr. W., tbe rest to boarders. On Saturday night the doorof the bedroom was broken open by means of chisels, the staple fastening the chain to the floor was drawn, and the safe let down Into the alley outside, and carried off! All this was done noiselessly, and without attracting attention, and no' one suspected anything wrong until pbout nine o’clock, when Sirs. Wockermeu vert to the bedroom and discovered that it had been broken open and the solo carried 07. This robbery was doubtless committed by persons who were familiar with the promises, and the supposition Is that several parties were concerned in it.' The safe vas a small one weighing about two hundred pounds, and’lt was probably handed down from the window to some one who had a wogonlatho alley ready to receive It. at tVcckerman, on discovering the rob bery.* Immediately eavo notice to the police, and olfored a reward of toOO for the recovery of the contents of the safe. The detectives are on the track of several suspected persons, and w© have no doubt that the perpetrators of the act will be arrested and brought to jus tice. The thieves were probably not ‘pro fessionals. ” but men who had become fami liar with the premises, and the proper time to do the work. THE MONEY CHANUEUS 5 TEMPLE. Formal Opening; of tbo Board of Bro kers’ New Building;, at New Tork. [From the New York Herald. 10th.] The old Stock Exchange at 23 William street proving insufficient tor the demands of business, the Board of brokers removed their headquarters yesterday to the new building, located at Nos. 11 and 13 Broad street. This magnificent building was opened yesterday for the first time for the transaction of the business of the Exchange. The edifice Is of white freestone, and fronts fifty feet on Brood street and eighty-fonr feet on New street. It is one hundred and fifty fectia depth and four stories in height. The style of architecture is the Corinthian, and the marble Is of the pur est white. Over the entrance, which is nine teen feet wide, is a beautiful projecting porti co, supported by handsome pillars twenty inches in diameter. At each side of the en trance is a window seven feet six Inches wide and nineteen feet'hlgh. On the first floor there is a large room, which extends from Broad street to New. This Is marble-floored, and finished in a very rich although simple style. A wide staircase leads to tbe second story, in the rear of which' Is a room in which the - business of the hoard will henceforward be transacted. This room Is very handsomely furnished with about three bundled black walnut upholstered chairs, with a black walnut rostrum, and a large table of tbe same material. Tho floor is made of oak and black walnut strips. Eight large windows afford ample light. The room Is Onr-four by seventy-five feet, and is thirty four feet in height. On tho upper floor there arc various rooms intended for committee meetings—there being in addition to the principal business room about a dozen apartments, all of w*hich will be devoted to the uses of the board. > In the cellar there is a vault for the deposit of securities. This is one hundred feet long and thirty feet in width, it contains a large number of safes, arranged in blocks of free stone, lined with Franklinite Iron, and is in laid with steel plates, rendering it absolutely burglar-proof and fire-proo£ With tbe most Improved tools used in cat ting stone and drilling iron a man could not penetrate the sides of this Immense safe In twenty-four hours. Each broker will be charged a yearly rent for the privilege of de positing his bonds, stocks and other securities, it Is expected that a handsome revenue will be derived from this source. The building is fire-proof throughout, and will bo heated by steam. It Is estimated that when completed the building will cost nearly three-quarters of a million of dollars. The first floor wDI not be occupied by the open Board for the present. It Is a largo and magnificent structure, hot a great deal of room Is wasted, and the or* rnngi-ments do not come up to the expecta tions ot the brokers. The lower hall, which will probably be open to the public at some fixed price. Is certainly very tine, and reoJiv the best part of the whole affair. The for the meetings of the Board will ha*'* k« draped, as the vibration la too to henr anything.

Several neat ond appropriate ad urcsscs were made by some of the members. They whiled away a portion of the time In singing until the great feature of the occasion —the banquet—was being prepared In the banquet room. Thither they adjourned and Eartook of a princely collation. Mr. Robert i. Cutting, President, and Mr. George n. Brodhead,* Secretary, did the honors in the most approved stvle. The wine cellars in Broad street (and their name Is legion) seemed to be completely emptied for the occasion, and the usual hobnobbing and inco herent protestations of eternal friendship took place. After a short time the t‘aal miles ” began to grow playful and frisky, and knock each other's haw over the eyes with their ppws. At porting the scene was one of unrcslralneujnhth and jollity. There was a bear attempting tP balance himself on bis hind legs, and hugging In ilifi embrace an ill natured ball, who made futile efforts to pu&« out his eyes with his horns. In the opposite end of the room a boll might be seen In a po sition such as matadorc never dreamed of, coiled np on a chair bellowing forth at inter vals, totto voce — We wont go home until morning.” One enthusiastic gentlemen proposed the success and prosperity of the two now Stock Exchanges, but he was promptly pulled down to his seat. Operations ol tbe United States mint for the Tear ending Jone r j;. Wc make the following lntercj.ijgs.atl3. tics from the annual report of the Director of the Mint for tbe fiscal year ending on the SOth of last June. In this are Included the receipts of the branch mint at Son Francisco, assay office, New Turk, and the branch at Denver City. > Gold and silver bullion received during the said fiscal year: Silver $ 1,183,403.23 Gold 81,065,30.74 Total ... *33,318.751.97 From ibis total amount there should be deducted for rudeposlU the following: Cold *1,035,535.93 Silver 1S0&9.80 Total.. $4,283,0033 Making a net total of deposits of gold and silver bullion of #37,082,849.09. The e tire amount of coinage for the same fiscal year is os follows: G01d....'. $53.89(1,099.95 Silver.; 950,318.60 Copper 7,183,830.00 Total .$21819,318.64 At the Branch Mint, San Francisco, the gold deposits were $18,603,818.49; gold coin ed, $18,670,840; silver deposited and pur chases, #540,299.20 ; silver coined, $828,600; silver bars, $145,285.58. The total coinage of gold and silver, $19,141,875.53; number of pieces, 1,775,116. i The Assay Office, In New York, received during the year, In gold bullion, $3,250,360.01; In silver, $320,111.38. Tbe number of fine gold bars stamped at that office Is 3,175; value, $4,917,809.21; silver bora, 1,859; value, $165,008.45: total value of gold and silver bullion, $5,570,871.37. The report of tbe Superintendent of the Branch Mint at Denver, Colorado Territory, represents Its operations os successful and en couraging. The gold deposits amounted to $541,559.04; silver, $7,050.81; total deposits, $548,609.85. The number of gold bars stamp ed were 469; value, $545,363.00. This branch Is engaged lu melting, refining, assaying and stamping gold bullion, returning the same to the depositors in the form of unparted bars, bearing the Government stamp oi weight and fineness. By tbe act of Congress passed March Bd, 1865, authority was given to coin a three cent piece of nickel and copper alloy, os a substi tute, to some extent, of the fractional paper currency. This coin has been Issued and pat In circulation. It Is neat in appearance ami convenient in size. If, In' addition to the already prohibited Lssne of three cent notes, the five cent note of the fractional paper cur rency were withdrawn.or Its circulation limit ed and gradually reduced, the demand for ibis new coin would be much increased- Its increased production and circulation would not only furnish a more desirable currency than paper, but would become a source of larger revenue to tbe Government. From tbe profits of tbe bronze and nickel coinage there has been transferred to the Treasury of the United States, daring the fiscal year, four hundred thousand dollars. ($400,000); and a few weeks after the expiration of the year, the farther sum of one hundred thousand dollars (#100,000), was in like manner trans erred; tbe .fund remaining being sufficient for all the pur poses of this coinage. - From this nickel alloy, a coin of the denom • ioatlon of five cents, and which would be a popular substitute for the five-ccnt note, could easily be made. This suggestion, how ever, is respectfully submitted In view of the probable withdrawal of the smaller denomi nations of tbe fractional paper currency, and apreparative and aid to its accomplishment. This to continue only until the resumption of ; specie payments, or for a fixed and limited period, in a country abounding In the pre cions metals, end with silver generally In ex cess, in time of peace, of all demands for coinage or other purposes, tokens, or coins of inferior alloy should not be permitted to take the place permanently of silver In the coin age of pieces above the denomination of three cents. It tbe nickel alloy coin of five ; cents shall be adopted; temporarily or other wise, provislonshonld be made for Its redemp tion in currency In sums not less than one hundred dollars, and In manner to snit the convenience of the Government, and to pre vent Its becoming troublesome by capricious . use. At the proper time, similar provision should be made for tbe redemption of the three-cent pieces In sums not less than sixty dollars. In regard to the motto for the coin of the nation, •* la God we trust,” It is expected that the issue for the coming year 1866 will be so embellished, and thus present to the ' world at large an unequivocal recognition of the sovereignty of God, and the nation’s trust in Him. Gen. Grant on tbe Last Campaign In misaourl. Gen. Grant’s comment on the lost cam paign in Missouri Is somewhat severe. After Gen. Butler demolishes the Lieutenant Gene ral, as he proposes to do, perhaps Gen. Rose crans will try his hand in a similar enterprise. The report says: “About tbe last of August, It being reported that the rebel Gen. Price, with a force of about 10,000 men, had reached Jacksonport, on bis way to in vade Missouri, Gen. A. J. Smith’s command, then en route from Memphis to join Sherman, was or. dered to Missouri. A cavalry force was also, at the same time, sent from Memphis, under command of Col. Winslow. This made Geik Eoaecrana’ forces superior to those of Price, and no doubt was entertained be would be able to check Price and drive him back, while the forces under Oen Steele, in Arkansas, would cut off bis retreat. On the 26th day of September Price attacked Pilot Knob and forced the pameon to retreat, and thence moved north to the Missouri river, and continued up that river toward Kansas. General Curtis, commanding Department of Kansas, Immediately collected such force* as he could to repel the inva sion of Kansas, while General Rosccruos* cavalry was operating In his rear. “The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated, with the loss ot nearly aU his artillery and trams and a large number ofpnsoucrs. He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas, Tbe impunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the Slate of Missouri for a long time, and tho incalculable mlachiet done by Hm, shows to bow little purpose a superior force may be used. Tturo is no reason why General Eosecrans should n» have concentrated hU forces and beaten and driven rice before the latter reached Pilot Snob, {Tor the Chicago Tribnne.l tub

Independent, 13th.} On Tuesday morning last, at an early hour, as some children were on their way to a neighbor’d bouse, in the southern suburbs of this city, 'while in a small grove, near the road, they came upon what they reported to their father as either a dead or drunken man.' The father, procuring the assistance of Frank Mitchell, Esq-at once repaired to the spot, and found the body of an unknown man lyin» ou lli® back, with a small single barrel revoC ver In his right hand, containing the shell of a cartridge. Deceased bad been shot in the head, the ball entering a little above, and just behind the right ear, passing through the head, and lodging against the skull on the onposite side. The eves and features general ly were so bloated and disfigured that recog nition seemed Impossible. He was about thirty years of age, rather dark complexion, dark hair, grey eyes, and was well dressed. One of his pockets was turned inside out. Every circumstance indi cates that ho was murdered and robbed. P. S.—Since the above was in type, we have learned from Geo. Hewitt, Esq.. conductor on tbe Chicago, Alton «fe St. Louis Railroad, that on Monday night of but week two men come down with his train from Chicago—one a tall, rough-looking customer, and the other an swering closely the description of the man found murdered ia tVUmiogton. Both had tickets for St. Louis, which Sir. Hewitt took op and exchanged for checks. The tallest one used every effort to persuade the other to leave the train .at Joliet, saying he would go no further, but his companion insisted upon going on. Accordingly both came on. The oell-cord being tampered with, tbe engineer stopped the tram three times be tween Joliet and this city, until he was or dered by tbe conductor to proceed and pay no attention to the bell. Mr. Hewitt and others ore positive that the cord was pulled by the taller of these two men. After leaving Wil mington neither of them were seen on the train. On arriving at Dwight a passenger, who bad been in the some cor with chesemen, reported to the conductor tbat be had been robbed somewhere below Joliet, while asleep. * Tbe Bloodhounds In Minnesota. _ . Maskato, Minn, Dec.7,1865. ■Editors Chicago Tribune: I see in your issue'of the 80th ult., some extracts from the report of “ a gentleman of considerable prominence ” to one ot the De partments at Washington. In speaking of Minnesota affairs, he says* that we “ sent south and got bloodhounds to bunt Hie Indiana with; and that the Indiana killed the dogs and ate them.” This statement Is true when so modified as to accord with the following facts: Every dog brought from tbe South to this State, for tbe pmpose of hunting Indians, is yet alive and well. Tbe dogs have not yet been, used In bunting Indians; bat, from experiments. It Is believed that they will give excellent satlsiaction when they ore so used. An Important Invention* Bow to restore heated or wet grain to a condition fit for mining purposes, or for shipment to any part of the world, is a problem that has tested the inge nuity tnd inventive powers of persevering and skil ful men for many years past. Bach succeeding year has added to the necessity foe contrivances of this character. Tbe enormous surplus production of tbe Great West must seek a market at t&e East, and a certain portion of the gram will always need the services of a dryer, at some point of its Journey In the present season, for <Ti«tnnrw | a large of grain received here has become heated, rein]dug in much perplexity and heavy loss. For this rea son, ihe grain dryers in this city have been con stantly employed, resulting in large profits to their owners. Thee© rich rewards bare naturally stimu lated the inventive genius of the country. Amrmj the Inventions now attracting the attention of grain merchants is “Sutton's Patent Grain Dryer and Cooler,” a model of which we have seen. Tbe model represents two round towers of brick work, precisely similar In construction, and m which precisely iitallar operations are carried on, but with entirely different results. Through the centre of each of these towers Is a perpendicular Iron shaft, around which revolve twelve chambers, the floors of which arc perforated, or slotted, lor tbe passage of air. One of these towers Is the gram dryer, and the other is tbe grain cooler, the first being supplied with hot air from a furnace, and tbe other with a constant ennent of cold air. The damaged grain la introduced into the grain dryer by a hopper at the top of the tower, from which it faDp upon the floor ol the upper chamber. The grain ia turned over and over, and hither and thith er, by means of a senes of arms or rakes with oblique blades or conveyors, which gradually sweep it toward tbe centre, where, from an opening around theperpendicnlar shaft, it all upon the sec ond floou Here it undergoes tbesame proceas,but on this floor the grain Is swept toward the outer edge, from whence It falls to the third floor, where, alter the same manipulations, it is moved toward the centre again, to tall to tbe next floor; and so on alternately, until it has travelled the whole scries of twelve floors. From the bottom floor the grain passes into a receiver. One operation is now com plete—the grain fa thoroughly dried—every kernel has been exposed to the same degree of neat, and every particle of moisture U expelled. But there remains one trouble. Tbe grain Is (fry, certainly, bat it is also warm, and therefore not fit for Immediate shipment. Time Is precious, and the Inventor of this beautiful system has provided tbe remedy. Be has expelled the moisture, and cow the watmlh must be expelled also. By a very simple process, tbe grain la elevated from the re ceiver into which it had passed from tho first tower (the dryer,) to tho top of the second tower, (tbe cooler,) from whence ft drops upon the first floor, and b raked and tumbled over over, passim from floor to floor, jnat as It did In the firattowsr, and in this way it becomes thoroughly coot as well os dry. The invention U not an experiment. It has stood the test of practical working. We learn that companies are being formed for the purchase ol the right to use this valuable invention at the pilndp&l ports on the lakes. The patent is owned principally by millers and grain dealers and for warders, who are well competent to judge of its practical value. Mr.J. A. Armstrong, of iheflrm of Crittenden A Armstrong, ot Buffalo, fa the Presi dent of the Company, to whom we refer for farther particulars. Honorably Acquitted. We translate the following from the struts Zti tang of yesterday: Jacob Cohen, the tobacconist, who was arrested •In this city on Sunday, the 3d of December, on a requisition o( the Governor of New York, and who was conveyed.to the city of New York, has already retained.
