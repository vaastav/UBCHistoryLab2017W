The President's Message Tbc portion of tbe mes-age which most , 'cafes us.irol one which will be received with etnDS gratification throughout tbe country, is that relating tj the reform oftbeCiTil Service. Tbe Pre.-ident declares that he ti&i tried to enforce huoMty and efficiency in the Sen ice, and the country will believe him. He declares that every faithlew public ser vant has been prosecuted with all tbc rigcr ,f the law. lie lays the fault of bad ap pointment? where it bslonp, on the CoDgrei menwhot recommendations to public office I c become practically tbe tame as appoint ments. He ecti forth tbe urgent need of a reform which shall correct this abuse. He believe the Civil Service Commission will succeed in dcTieiog a plan which will recure this end. will greatly relieve the executive, heads of detartments and Congressmen, and redound to the true interest of the public. He declares ul he is a man of his word that the ciperiinent " shall hare a fair trial." c believe him, and we doubt not that euch a reform will be the highest glory of his ad ministration. The 1'ro-ident aUo lecomuicnds general am nesty, for all except some of the great crimi nals engaged in tbe rebellion. For this measure the Country is now probably ripe, and wo doubt D'.t it will I adopted by Con grew. He recommends also a reduction of taxa tion, though at tho expense ot a lees rapid reduction of the public debt. He recom mend! protectory legislation for immigrants. He recommends the ital telegraph system. He recommends, of course, the necessary legislation to carry 'into full effect the Treaty of Washington. He declares that Polygamy shall be put down in Utah, while recom mending measures which shall make the re sults bear as lightly as possible on the unfor tunate victims of the Mormon system. He stands firmly by the Ku Klux law and tbc action taken under it. The message is concise, direct and Teadable, anl it will etrengthen the President with the people. The Anti-Grant Party. It ii olii'ious, we presume, to the Free t'reit. that any Republican cn now oppose Oen. Grant's re nomination.vfithout even the thought, much leu the purpose, of re-ergan'uing a new party. The New York Tribune, for iostanct, ie understood to be opposed to the ie-nominatton of Oen. Orant, but if he should be fairly nom inated by the Republican National Convention, the Tribune would not oppose his election. Nothing hit yet appealed to warrant any pro phecy that the candidate named by the next Re publican National Convention will not oomman j the united support of the party. But this not only does not render it any the less import ant that there thould be a full and frank expres sion of oninion and comparison of views bejore the Convention ; it makes it all the more neces iry that such a free discussion should be had. If the action of the Convention is to be acqui esced in, it becomes of the first consequence mat the preferences of all portions of the party ihould be fairly weighed before the candidate is selected, and that the best man should then be placed before tbc people for their saffrases. Monlpelier Freeiuan. Btfore the decision of the National Republi ctn Convention, cf course foil and free discus sion m regard to candidates is in order. Tbe party has a ri?ht to select tbe test man, all thing! considered ; and everr republicin has a perfect right to enjoy, and express, his opinion as to who is the best nan. The Fart; l'atss has intimated nothing to the contiary. The article upon which the J-Vtrmua comments above, had reference, not to any action within the republi can party of men who intend to support the nominee cf the party ; but to the movements, based on the assumption thit President Orant will be renominated, to effect a coalition between the democratic patty and a dissatisfied minority of the republicin rarty to accomplish the over throw of the renlar republican nominee. Such movements are on foot To what extent the New York TYiouns is concerned in them, we do not know. The TYisune opposed Mr. Lincoln's re-nomination, but acquiesced in it, after it was made. It oppored Gen. Grant's nomination ; but acquiesced again. It probably cannot afford to do otherwise than acquiesce ajain , at least in form, if Orant is renominated ; but he is a bold man who undertakes positively to predict the oaane of the TViiunf. Mr. Greeley has been suggeelel ar the candidate of the Anti-Grant Party. Prominent democrats have said they were ready to support him. What he or the 7Vioune woullor would not do, under such Iniluencei, we certainly cannot say. The Free man, we tale it forzranted, will support the nominee of tbe republican party. Hat while it is true that any discussion of candidates not intended to work a division of the patty, is justifiable till a nomination has been foimally made, it is a!so the fact, as it stems to cs, that the great majority of the republican party are not in doubt in respect to their choice. Nor is President Grant's strength as a candidate for reuomination, due to the professed politicians. He cu'a too often across party lines in his ap. pointments, and is tco independent of " slates" and ' rings" to be jersonallya favorite with tbe politicians as achats; and such support him mainly because of his stieigth with the voters. Uii Individual chancer does not awaken much of enthusiasm or o' tbe sentiment of personal loyalty Bat the Republican masses desire for President first cf all an honest man, who will strive to se cure economy, purity and cfCcteccy in the public service. They desire one who, will firmly but not vindictively guard the great results secured by the war against the rebellion, and one who will cot needlessly embroil us with fcreign na tions. It is because they believe Gen, Grant to have sloan himself to be such a man; tecause they believe his mis'.ales to have been honest mistakes; and because they feel that there is a certainty about his fature course in these res pects, which they would not feel with an un tried man, that they sustain him, by State after State, and will sustain him by tteir delegates in the National Convention. Thii cpinion of him Is not that of weak or ill-informed men. The Freeman has expressed its preference for Mr. Colfax, for the head of the ticket. Mr. Colfax has, in other words, the purity of character and purpose, the clearness and strength cf mind, the ability to judge of men, the firmness and the Independence which the freeman deems requisite for the head of the gov ernment. Yet Mr. Colfax, far Utter situated to Judge of the character cf Gen. Grant and of tht way In wbieh it has snitaiced himself under 'the trying demands of his position, than the edi tor of the Fre-man or we can be, and having no personal aim to serve, for he has meet posi tively withdrawn himself from all candidacy for public office, is one of the Heartiest turP... of President Orant George William Curtis. 01 whom the Freeman has a high opinion, is other The number cf such well balanced, hon est and intelligent friends of the President could u:. i;t indefinitely. And it probably does not lessen their number, that the oppesition to hisrenominationis so largely confined to sore headed politicians, aspirants for the presidency, and men, (in none of which classes do we in clude our friend of the Frteaan,) who are so excessively indepetdeat that tbe fact that the majority in one way alwajs sends them the ether way. The Census in Canada- In Canada, as ia the United States, a census is talen once in ten years, and that for 1871 has just been published. Our Canadian neigh bors have little reason to be pleased with the result. They hid confi dently counted on an in crease of 1,200.000 in their population, but the inexorable returns show that it is really but one third that amount. The census for 1SC1 in the provinces of Oatario, Quebec, New Bruswick and Nova Scotia, shows a total population of 

Z,WO.X. That of 1871 in the same provinces, gives the number of inhabitants as 3,481,921, showing an increase of 1 .303. The previous estimate by the Canadians 4,:S3,108. This is a poor show compared with the result of the . ftr 1671 in the United States. In view ! of this exhibit it would be well enough for our ! friends across the line to ask themselves if something is not the cutter These returns do not include British Columbia, with 60,000 population ; Newfoundland with lSU.tKW. anu rineeKiward's Island with 90.000. Taking the entire possessions of British North America, with an area of 620,000 square miles, they include only about 3.751,000 inhabitants. The increase in the last ten years, is least in pro portion in the Quebec Province, and we can icadily believe that it is in greit'measureowing.to a steady emigration from that part of Canada to the United States. Ontario shows a very limit ed increase, in spite of its advantages. While tbe Dominion at large has gained only about 13 per cent, in the decade, the United States have gained about 22 per eeni . in spite of a long and devastating war. Tbe area of Ontario is t .ice tha' of New 1 ork and she has l.G30,(K)0, while that State has 4, 870,000. A hundred years ago, the popula tion'cf the two was about qui'. Compare New EngHnd with Canadi, and a like contrast ii saown. Canada is ten times as large in area, yet barely exceeds New England in population. Another ten years will, at the present rate, put New England ahead. A reason for this presents itself, and. possibly, the Canadians miy find a sati-faetory-answer. Let them meditite. The Dominion his increased in wealth, but exhibits a lanquid growth in population. Hermineearewellworkel; her lumber inte rests prosperous snd her revenue from imports has doubled in tbe last ten years. Yet Canada is unattractive to immigration and even incapa ble cf retaining her own people, who continue to seek homes across the border. Georgia is about to make up a veiy pietty case for the constitutional lawyers to exercise their wits upon. Tbe Governor having resigned and there being no Lieutenant Governor in office, the President of the Senile h taken upon himself gubernatorial powers. But as his term as Senator is about expiring, the question is raised whether, when be eeise to be a Senator, he cm continue to be actiDg Governor by reason of bis former Presidency of the Senate. He claims that ai Pre-ident of the Senate he be comes acting Governor for the full unexpired term of the Governor who has resigned. On the other hand, it is contended that when his Senatorial term expires, hie gubernatorial pow ers, existing only by virtue of bis Senatorial offi:e. must cesse also At this point of the discussion most people would pronounce the dispute " a very pretty .,ntrre! as it stands " But the Georgians app-ar determined to involve the question to the utnost limit of legal jwsi bility. The legislature pai'tJ a bill ordering a new election for Governor, which the acting Governor vetoed, on the grcund thit be ie him selfmide Governor by the Constitution. The bill has been peed over his veto, however, and the election will be held, when the question must at once come up whether the acting Gov ernor or the Governor elect is the constitutional executive. But lest some possible eomp'icition should te avoided by accident, the legislature in serted a clause in its bill directini thit the newly elected Governor shall be inaugurated on the day following his election. Now it is almost impossible to know on the day followin; of an election who the successful candidate is If the inauguration be postponed to await returns, the question whether a later inauguration is legal or not, must present ilself ; and in trying to install the Governor elect on the day presonbed, it is ju-t possible that the wrong man will be put in office, which would raise two or three more knotty issues. The lawyer" if Georgia are in luck, certa;nly. VsaiMOSTiEs ox the Iloisx Comxitties. Ver mont his certainly no reason to complain of neg lect of her representatives in the allotment of the House Committees. As the places on the committees fill over a hundred short of enough to go twice around, not every member can be placed on two committees. Yet each of our Vermont men have places on two important com mittees, and Judge Poland is on three. Two chairmanships also fell to Vermont Mr. Smith retains his place on tbe committee on; Banking ai Currency, and is also on the committee on Mines. Mr. Willard is third on the important com mittee on Foreign Affairs, and ie chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary and 1812 Ten sions. Mr. Willard was complimented by being among tne number whose names were canvassed in connection with the committee of Ways and Means. Judge Poland susceeds Mr. Shellabarger, is chairman of the Select Committee on the enforce ment of the laws in the insurrectionary States, lie is also on the committee on the Revision cf the Liws, and on tlu committee on the District of Columbia. " II.sTOKT Rekiis Irssxr." " Thssh; is Noruiso New Uxbb tbs Sps." We read that at the late election in the city of New York, Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhtill presented her te'f at the polling booth ami tendered her vote, which was refused. And we further read that the aforesaid lady wis, or pietecded lo be, highly ir.digmnt ibereat ; and thit wttiin divers oiler women proceeded in like manner. Now this phase of " women's rights " is not by any means a afm thing ! Hear old Samuel Duncan testify : ' He was a Polltlerke in an election for Knights of Shire, for ye Countie of Buffolke, at Ipswich, Old England, which l ginne there upon Monday, October 10, this present year 1610," c. .Memorandum "Upon Tuesday morning some women came to be sworn for the two fore said Knig'aL", and Mr. Robert Clerke did take some of them ; but as soon as Mr. High Sheriffe had intelligence cf it, wee had worde brought to the table where Sir. Clerke and mysilfe wrot, that Mr. Sheriffs would have us take no wo men's oath. And so we refused the rest of the women after that notice frcm Mr. High Sheriffe. And when Mr. High Sheriffe cattup tht boakt, hi catt out the women out of the general lumme." The foregoing is a fragment from the records of the ejections which resulted in the " long Forliament," Oiiver Cromwell, etc. A. D , 1640. " There were women in tkote days.' It Tuc Message is Wasuixuton. Washington specials say : Toe President's message seems to have given satisfaction to all republicans, in cluding those who are regarded as anti-idminis-tration. Even tbv Democrats speak cf it as a document full of good po-nte, and so far do not find much finlt, except with the clause referring to the Ku-Klux operations. The allusion to the Mormon difficulties and the determination expreised to execute the laa, meets with great approval. Mr. Hooper, the Utah delegate, say. the President's handling of the Mormon question is cot as severe as he ex pected,acd he finds no fault with the President's recommendation. Mr. Hooper will introduce in the House, and ask its immediate passage, a bill allowing an appeal to the Supreme Court in all criminal cases tn Utah Territory. With tbe passage of such a bill Mr. Hooper is confident that the Mormon, already convicted will be cleared. William Wells Reynold., of Brandon, has re ceived a patent for a machine for graduating scale beams. Alexander S.

The isnort of the Seoretary of the Interior shows that Ihe grants ot lanus ior me u,UF ment of our railway sjstem have added ersen tially lo Ihe pro-pcrity of the country. At the close of last year there were 1.1,000 miles of railroad, completed, projected, or In process cf construction, under an impetus given by tie government gr.nts. About ;400.000.000 worlh of government linds have been given to com panies in constructing these railroids. Aecord- 1 ing to the usual estimates of tbe increaiea value 1 of property by the introduction of railjiads, these lines have added 51,500,000,000 to the wealth of the nation. The new regions opened 1 to settlement by these railroads have attracted upwards of a million of immigrants. This new i populition have, by their industry, created tew i wealth. Doubtless railroads have in tome in 1 stances misused tbe gifts of land glinted them ; but as a whole, the people and Ihe sections traversed by the new roads have resped sub stantial benefits that far outweigh tbe Ics'ei by irregulirities or the abuses of trust.

Several persons were viinly asked to become his sureties, and at last, at mid night.Connolly was forced to admit that futther search was useless, and reluotintlantly consent ed to be conveyed to jail, ne was kindly receiv ed by Warden Tracy, and provided with a com fortable bed. As if in mockery of his present humiliation, the first object which met his gate rn entering Ihe jail, was a full-iijsd portrait of himself in the day. of hi. prosperity. Connolly seemed much depressed in spirits, and tooked.in ftct, like a broken-hearted rain. He is stated to have ctied like a child when taken to jail. The New York Times eijs : " Mr. Edmunds did a sensible thing on the opening day of tbe isssion, in introducing to tbe Senate the bill for the civil service reform, originally presented by Mr. Jenckes, of Rhode Island. This bill, al though it twice failed in the House, wis each time refoittd by a special committee, after care ful investigation, which disclosed the most glar ing and shameful evils in our civil service. In now sgain bringing it before Congress, Mr. Edmunds stated di-tlnctly that it aa dene with the expectation that the President would, for his own term, inaogurale a thorough system of re form ; but that he considered it necesiiry to place it out of power of any succeeding Ad ministration to overthrow it." The bill of Mr. Edmunds provides for a Civil Service Commir sion, wi.h the Vice President at its head, whose duty it is tn provide for competitive examina tions, by which all admi'siots to, and promo lioae in, Ihe civil service shall be determined. Tut Gaaxn Dvec Attxis. He U a fine specimen of pbysicil minhooil over six feet in height, very broad shouldered, deep chested, erect, supple and elastic of movement. He re sembles his father, Alexinder. '.hsugh his nose is cot aquiline, and his features are somewhat heavier. His hair, short side whiskers and slight moustache are light brown, and his gen eral appearance is quite German, naturally enough, for he is by blood at leas: three quar ters Teutonic. Only twenty-two, he might resdily be mistaken for a man of twenty-seven or twenty-eight, owing, probably, to a certain seriousness, if not sternnes of expression char acteristic of his family. Aleiis can hardly be called handsome, and there is nothing princely, as the adjective is ideally understood, in his face, form or bearing. Still, he ia well enough, anlhisappearance.cn the whole, prepossess ing. The impression he conveys we sre all conscious or unconscious physiognomists is that he is a young man of strong will, earnest purpose, positive nature and frank disposition, wanting, perhaps, in tome of the sympathies and sensibilities which round and give grace to well-balanced character. In addition to English, which he uses with remarkable purity and fluency, he speaks, I understand, German, French, Polish, Bohemian, Hungarian, Italian and Spanish. He draws well, (he certainly drew well to-day) ; paints tolerably ; is a clever musician, a good shot and a capital swordsman. Being his father's favorite child, unusual pains have been taken with his educa tion, and he is said to have employed his op portunities to the best advantage. Schastox sotSiskikQ. -A letter frcm Scran ton dated cn the 24th. shows that the reported sinking of that town, caused by the working cf a coal mine under it, has been greatly ex aggerated. These are declared to be the fact. : Years ago a large plot on the outskirt. of the city was purposely robbed of all its pillars and support, with a viewcf sinkim the entire sur fsce. Acres cf this ground have fallen during 10 years past snd become quite solid. The re mainder of this plot must fall in time. There are not half a dozen buildings in tbe whole tract, and these are cheap frame temments, built with the knowledge that Ihe land was ex pected to cave. The main portion cf Scrantca is not undermined and never will be. The tame writer says that the damage by the sicking of the Oxford mine at Hyde Pa.k has likewise been greatly exaggerated.

Ihe total number of letters exchanged, dur ing the year, with foreign countries was 20, 25,910, an increase of 1,30,620 over the number reported for lb70. Of this number, 10,461 ,88 were sent from, ani 9,83 1,M8 were received ia the United Statts.

Noticing the project for establishing an Am erican line between ThilaJelphia and Liverpool, Mr Cresswell remarks : " A reasonable com pensation for conveying the mails, in excess of the postage receipts, is probably the enly gov ernment aid needed to insure the permanent es tablishment of this or any other similar line of American ocean steamers; and, in my judg ment, the granting of such aiJ, in connection with proper legislation to encourage the con struction, by American buUlers of first-class iron Bteamshipe, is the most simple, economical, and practical methl of establishing American lines of ocean steamers, and advancing the gen eral commercial prosperity of the country." The total appointments in the department during the year number 8370, and the total number cf employes is now 43,9S4. During the last fiscal year the number of money-order offices in operation was 2070. On the3Istof July, 1871, 37C additional money order offices were established, so that the whole number of such Sees is at present 2132; the number of domestic mrney-ordrrs issued daring the year was 2.151.7C4, the aggregate value of which was S42.1G4. 118.03 ; the number of such orders paid was 2,121,661. amounting in value to c 6 1,7 0-3, GO 7. 03 ; to this sum is to be adied the amount cf orders repaid to the pur chasers, S321.CC0.23 ; total of payments, S42. 027,330.31.

I gratifying to bo able to itate that during the past year succe-s has generally attended the efforts to execute all laws found upon the statute books. The policy has been not to enquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent, and to enforce them accordingly. Ihe past year has, under a wise Providence, been one of general prosperity to the nation. It his, however, been attended with more than us ual chastisement in the leas of life and property by storm and file. These disssters have served to call forth the best element, of human nature in our country, and to develope a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations, which goes far toward alleviation Ihe distresses occasionel by the elements. Ihe benevolent who hive so generously shared their meanj with the victim, of these misfortunes, will reap their reward in the cousciousnes. of hiving performed a nooie act, and in receiving the grateful thank, of men , women and children, whose suffering, they have relieved. rut iseait or 

WASIIISOTOX. i The relations of the United States with foreign I powers continue to be friendly. Tbe yfar has .n .ntr..l ..,. in witnessing two creat nations, speaking one language and haying one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbitration, dis putes of long standing, and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloody and hostile con flict. An example has thus been set which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of men now msinttined to settle the dispute of na tions by the biyonet and tbe broad sword. I transmit, herewith, a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded, since the adjourn ment of Congress, with Her Britanic Majesty, and a copy of tbe protocols of the conference of tbe commiif ioners by whom it wis negotiated . The treaty provide, methods of adjusting the question, pending between the two nation.. Various questions are to he adjusted by arbitra tion. I recommen 1 Congress, at ao early day, to make the necessary provisions for the tribunal at Geneva, and for tbe several commissions on tbe part of the United Slates called for by the treaty. His .Maje-ty tho King of Italy, the President of tbe Swiss Confederation, aud His Msjesty the Emperor ef Braid, hav each con sented, on the joint request of the o powers, to name an arbitrator for Ihe tribunal at Geneva. I have canted my thanks to be suitably expressed for the leadinew with which the joint request has been compile! with, by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these imfortant position. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the governments, and has consented t. act as' the arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Britain. Tbe contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard, as between themselves, certain principles of public iaw, for which tbe United States have contended from the commencement of their history They have also agreed to bring these punciples to the knowledge of the other mant tme powers, and invite theui to icc-de ti them. Negotiations are going on as to the form by which the invitation is to be ex.er.ded to the other Dover.. 1 recommend the legislation nec essary, on the part of the United States, to bring into operation the article, of the treaty reining to tne fisheries, anl to the other mat- 1 ters toucbtnc the rsiationsoi .ne tnneu oiaies States toward the British Nortu American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legis la'ion shall be had cn Ihe part of Great Britain ai I her 1. -crtons.

It ha 1 been male tbe agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington, between p'enijotentiaries of Spain and tbe alhel Siuth American republics, which has resulted iu an arm.stice, with the reasonable afltmrance cf permanent peace. The intimate friendly relations, which have so long existeJ, between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of tbe third son of the 1 mperor is a proof that there is no desire ou the part of his government to diminish the cjrdiihty of these relations. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on onr side we share the good wishes cf that government. The inexcusable co r e of the Russian minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall and to decline to longer receive th functionary ss a diplomatic representative. It was impossible, with self respect, or with a jast regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Sir. Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse with this government after his personal abuse of the government officials, and his persistent interference, through vinous means, with the relations between the Un:ted States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, this government has been relieved of further inter course with Mr. I'aucazy and the masagement of the affairs of the Imperial Legation has pasted into tbe baud of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable. j WAS. With Japan, we continue , maintain most intimate relations. The cabinet of -the Mikado has, since tbe close of the last session of Corgress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance, in several de partments of the government, ani I have reason to thinK that this Meet ion ia due to an appre ciation of the disinterestedness cf tbe policy which tbe United States has pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to main tain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is to disposition on tbe part of this government to swerve from its established coarse. 

THECOEBUS Dl rFCULTIEJ. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbaric treatment of our shipwrecked sailors, on the Corean coast, I inetructel our Minister at Pekio to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea, for securing tbe stft'y and humane treatment of such mariners. Admiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with a suffi cient force to protect him iu cae ot need. .V small surveying party wis sent out, but, on reaching tbe coast, was treacherously attacked at a disadvan ag Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology for the in sult, but neither came. A force was then land ed, and after au anuous march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts front which the outrige had beea committed were reduce! by a gallant assault and were destroyed. Uav.ngthus punished tho criminals snd having vindicatel tbe honor jf the flag the expedition returned, finding ir impracticable under the circumstances to conclude tbe desire l convention. I respect fully '.eferto the correspondence relating thereto, hereivith submitted, and leave the subject for su'.h action as Congress may see fit to take. MEXICO ASP SOUTH AMERICA. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable laws, establishing what is known as the Free Zsoe, on the frontier of the United States. It is hoped that this nay jctte done, and, also, that more stringent measures will be taken by that Republic for res training lawless persons. And I hope that Mex ico, by its own action, will soon relieve this gov ernment of the difficulties experienced from these causes. Our relations with the various republics cf Central and South Amerioa continue, without exception to be cordial and friendly. I recom- mend nni action, by Conircss, rejarfinc he , overdue installments, unier the award, of the , Venezuela claims commission, of 1668. me in- , ternal dissensions of this government Fre" ' to juitification'for the absence of effort to meet tbeir soicmn treaty obligations. i The ratifieatioi of the Extradition Treaty 1 with Nicaragua has bceu exchanged. It is a j sut'jsct tor congratulation tnat me great i-mwv of JJrazit ha. taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Ojr relations with that empire, alwajs cordial, will natural'y De made more so by this act It is cot too much to hope that the government cf Brazil may hereafter find it for its interest aa well as intna. 1 sically right to advance towards entire emanci- ' pation more rapidly than the present act con .emrlates. The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found iu the elevation and edu cation cf its laborers. It is a subject for rsgret that the reforms ia this direction uhich were voluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spun, have not been carried out in its West India colo nics. The law. and regulations for the appa rent abolition of slavery in Cuba tad Torto Bico leave most of the laborers in bondage with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their employers. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that oituens of the United States, or persons claiming to beciti ress of the United States, are large holders iu foreign lsnds of this species cf property, forbid den by the fundamental law of their a'leged country. I recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning of or dealing in slaves or being inlereetel in slave property iu foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mort gagees, by the citizens of the United Statos. It is to be regretted that the disturb? 1 condition of the Island of Cubioontinues to bj a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a protracted itruggle in such a close proximity '0 our own territory, without apparent prospects of au early termination, cannot be other than an object cf concern to a people who, while abstain ing from interfering in the affairs of other pow ers, naturally desire to see every other country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, I'.berty and the blessings cf free institutions Our naval commanders in Cuban waters havo been instructed, iu case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and pro perly of bona fide American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag, ll n- hoped that all pending questions with Spun (trowing out of tbe affairs m Cuba, may be adjusted m the spirit of peace and concihatioj wbich has hitherto guided the two powers in their treat ment ot such questions. To give importance and add to the efficiency of our diplomatic rela tions with Japan and China, and to fur her aid in retaining the good opinion of thee- people, and to insure to the United Sta'es it. share of the commerce destined to flow between these na tions and the balance of the commercial worlJ, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four An-erican youth, in each of those countries to icrve as a part rf the official family of our Ministers tuerr.

I oail your attention to the pruvij..'iis ut the act of Congress, appro -ed Marr': 11. l ', which discontinues promo'icns iu:he staff jps of the army, unless provided for ry law I rtv cjtnmeud that the number in each grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the num- i ber in any graie falls below the nuc.ber o Bxel, tbe vacancy may be filled by pro mot -on fro&i the grade below. I also recommud that when the 1 office of Chief of Corps becomes vacated, the place 1 may be filled by a selection fron the corns in which tbe vacancy exists. TIIE HVV UEinKTAai; T. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an 1 improvement in the number and efficiency cf the , naval force, without material lucrease m 'he expense of supporting it This .s due to te j policy which has been adopted, au i ia be: ig ex tended as fast as onr material will aclmitc', using smaller vessels for cruisers at the several stations. By this means we hare been enabled so jcupy, at 1 once, a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently the ports, where the presence of ; onr flag is dftirable, and generally to discharge j raoretffisiently the appointed du.it of the navy tn time of pesos, without exceeding the number , of men, or the expenditures authorised by law. 1 During the past tear the nvry has, in addition to its regular servioe, supplied the men and , officers for the vessels of the coast service, and ' has completed tbe surveys authorise.! by Con gress, of the Isthmus cf larien and Tehnantepec, j and under like authority, has sent out an ex- j pedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of tbe north. The ' S3ggestiona of the report, as to the necessity for I increasing aud improving the materiel cf the ! navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the persone! of tbe service to a peace stan Jard, by the gradual abolition of certain graies of officers, the red r.c tion of others and the employment of ' same ia tbe service cf the commercial marine, are well considered and deserve the thoughtful at tention cf Congress. I also recommend, that all i promotions in the navy, above the raak of 4iptac, be by selection .instead cf seniority. This course will secure, in tbe highest grades, greater efficiency, and bold out incentives for young officers to improve themselves ia the knowledge of their profession. The present oost o: maintain ing the navy itself, compared with that of the preceeding year, anl the eitimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying report of the Secretary cf the Navy. tde rodT orncc department. The enlarged receipts cf the Post Offise Depart ment, as shown by the acoompaoyin report of the Tcstmaster-General, exhibit a gratifying in crease in that branch of the public service. It is tbe index of the growth of education, and of the prosperity of the people elements highly conJucive to the vigor ani ability of a Repub lic. With a vast territory like ours, much of it rparselj populated, but requiring the service cf the mails, it is not at'pre&ent to be expected that this department can be made self-sustaining i but a gradual approach to this end, from year ia year, is contUectly relied on, anl the day is net far distant when the post-jf5ce department of tbe Government will prove a mash greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The sugges tions of the Postmaster-General, for improvement in the department presided over by him, are earnestly recommenled to your special attention. THX 

POSTAL TELEQRAril RECOKHFJTDD. And especially do I recommend your favorable consideration of the plan for uaiting the tele graphic system of the United States with the postal system. It is believel that by such a course, the cast of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, if n;t better rendered with further a Wantage by exen 1 isg the telegraph through portions cf the ccun try where private eaterprhe will not construct it, Cqmmsrce, trade, anl above all, the efftpt to bring a people widely separated into a com- munity of interest, are al ways benefitted by rapid intercommunication. Education, the ground work of republican institutions. Is encouraged by increasing ths facilities, together with speedy news frcm all parts of the country. Tho desire to reap the benefit of such Improvement will stimulate education.

In private life, services demand compensation equal to the services rendered. A wise economy wonld dictate tbe sime rule in the Government service.

Mc.e thfcu s:x years having elapsed since the last hostile guu was fired between the armies then arrayei against each other, one for the per petuation, the other for the destruction, of the Union, it may wcil be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the fourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not exclude tbe ballot, but only imposes the disability to bold o&ke upon certain chuses. When the purity cf the ballet is se cured, the majority are sure to elect officers re flecting the views of the majority. I d not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were, before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take an oath to support the cos tutu tion, and admiting to eligibility those entertaining ths same views, bo,t 0 k standing a their communities. It tnaj be said that the former violated an oath which the latter did not. The Utter did not have it in their power to do so If they bad taken this oath it cannot be doubted they would hive broken it, as did the former class. If there are any qret criminal!, distinguished above all ethers, for the part they took in opposition to the Government, they might, in tbe judgment of Congrets, te excluied from such amnesi j.
