The ": total product of Barley., in the United States and Territories in 1860 r was 15,825,998 bushels.": Barley .is said to be more widely distributed and more generally "used' than ' aDy other grain ,:and an important , article of food for man in remote times. . Pliny speaks of it as the first grain cultivated for nour - ishment It is adapted to hot and cold climates. : It is not . known where it Originated, j The plant is said 1 to grow wild Sicily and tbe interior of Asia, . and a common species is said to occur 'In a wild state in some parts of the - United States. ' " ''-' The barley cultivated in this country ' is of two species, the Htolgare and the H distichon.'' A third species is culti- - "valed - in Europe, called1 the 1 1I 'Xenas- - tichon, or Fall and Winter barley. It was sown in -Palestine in 'Autumn and reaped' in the Sping. At the the . Passover the. Hebrews frequently used barley bread. It was aisoj used es food for cattls. It is principally-cultivated in the United States for the purpose of ' manaiactoring beer, it is more pro- ductive than any other, kind of grain. ; It succeeds well in almost any bind of ' The climate of the United States is aid not to bo very well adapted the . production of a superior article of bar ley.'j It requires a moist climate, con vz seqaently the EDglish barley is superior to oura L ..i.. it'. ! .;. "i . There is quite a' contrast in regard to the production of barley in the different States.' compared with that of other grain. : California -ranks second small- , ,'est in the production of Indian corn in 1860, the 11th in wheat, and 4th in rye, find' 4th 4n Oata and first fa 6arley, hav ing produced in 1860, 4,418,426 bushels of barley. 'Next in. order is New York lr producing 4,186,668 bushsls.i Ohio is third, and Illinois is fourth in order. The increase in the production ot bar ley in the New England States, in I860, "was 300 per cent.; producing in' 1860, 1,199,119 bushels, Maine having ' the largest increase, being 500 per cent. , The increase in the Middle States was about 33 per cent. ' New York produces ever 85 per cent, of the barley produced in the Middle States. rj-M Tbe increase in the Western States over that of 1850 was more than 600 pet' cent ; The Increase IrfHHnbia was j. 1,000 per cent, and in Iowa about 1,800 per cent. The increase in the Southern States' was nearly 400 per' cent , pro" "ducing ;, 19,930 bushels in 1860 to, 56,132 bushels in 1850. r i " ViO It will be seen that the prodaction of Barley in' the Southern States, is very Ismail, ' The single State of ; Maine pro-, ''dncca nearly four times as much as the " entire Southern States. It is also worthy B of notice tliat Cillforiia produces nearly all the Hnts j tiwduced in Jhe Pacific State's " ",' ' I " "" ' j ,31 LTve production of "barley .more ' (ban keeps up with the increase of population. The produot in 1860 is more than twice that ol-1850- to each person. It" was mora than doable - in the New England States, nearly. four times as great in the Western 'States, and about five times as great in the Paoifio States. In the M die States the increase has fallen below t the increase of population. . B.j -'"-''- From the N.Y. Tribune. f;;Bcport of the Secretary; Jf the ., r , Interior.

The report of the Secretary of the Treasury we priut in full elsewhere; in this column we present a synopsis of its most important statements of fact and opinion, including the three Jopifs of Currency, Public Debt, and Revenue, and pursuing the order in which they are treated by Mr. McCulloch. I. The Currency The key to tbe policy which the Secretary advocates may be found in the declaration of his belief that tbe authority of tCongress to make the obligations of Congress a legal tender resides outside of the Constitu tion, and that the inflation which has followed npon the necessary exercise ?f that authority during the war is preju dicial to both public and private inter ests. While, therefore, he does not advocate the repeal of the legal tender acts, ncr believe it possioie to reauoe the volume of the currency by violent measures, be is of opinion that those acts should be regarded asonly -ted-? porary, and that the work of retiring the notes which have been issued uodaY tbem should be commenced without d$ lav. and carefully and persistently con tinued nntil all are withdrawn.- ; The rapidity of the process will depend npoh the ability to dispose of securities; .The specific measures recommended -are as follows: f- "ir ',; First: That Congress declare that the compound interest notes shall eease to be a legal tender from the. date of their maturity. These notes were . intended to be a security rather than a circulating medium, and such a declaration.-? Con gress would be neither injurious tQ;the public nor an act ot bad fattnltor the holders. . r c, C : o j , " Second: That the Secretary be author ized in his discretion to sell bonds of the United States, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding six per cent.rand -redeem ab'.e and payable at such periods as may be conducive -to the interests of. the Government, for the purposes! retiring not only compound interestnotes but tbe United States notes. u Th amount ' which the Secretary es timates as necessary to be retired in or der to bring the currency within proper limits 'is" from one hundred to two hun dred millions;, iui addition to -the com pound notes, tbe amount of which latter, Oct. 31. was $173,012,141; all' dae in 1867 and 1868. The total-Taper circu lation of Jhe Unfttd -States at that date was $704,218,038', to &(hioh rshould be' added : fati.OUU.OUO, -,the: -estimated amountot compound, interest- notes actually v in circulation. The total i likely tc be still i further increased by the issue of notes to tbe National banks now daily, going On, and destined 'tor con tinue till the limit of $300,000,000 an thorized by law shall Save been reached, ai it will be at no distant date As but $185,000,000 of National Bank notes are included m tbe estimate of $7a4y 218,038 20, there remain $115,000,000 to b added, and the aggregate amount of circulation wiu then be $849,213, 038 20t"tIf the recommendations of .tbe Secretary in regard, tc contraction be fully carried ut by -retiring $200,000, 000 of United States notes .and the $30,000,000 of compound interest notes actually . In circulation, there will -still remain a total circulation of $019,218, 038 20, even supposing that no exten sion of the amount of National Bank notes now authorized to be. "issued be granted by Congress. It is, perhaps, in view of these , or similar calculations that the Secretary adda to his suggei tions ths remark that neither . the amount of n t action; nor tbe time that will be required to bring up the currency to: the specie standard can now be esti mated with artydegr6e of accuracy, The.firtt thing to.be done is to establish the policy of contraction. : '-r II.

W Awaits, fbe report of the 'special corn mission expected early in f P' senoiorM In reference to the i Southern States, tha. Secretary recom mends that tbe collection of taxes ac cruing before the establishment therein of revenue offices be indefinitely post poned; that sales of property for direct taxes be postponed till the States have an opportunity of assuming those taxes, as the loyal States did; and that all transactions invalid for want of stamps be legalized so far as lies in the power of Congress. For a great variety of statements and suggestions on other points the report itself may be consulted. Beport of the Controller of the vurrcuij. The Hon. Freeman Clarke presents a compact statement of tba year's work, which m present in full. - The report is accompanied by about 140 pages of sta tistics relating mainly to the condition of National Banks. - Since the last re port, ztii new banks have been organ- zed, and 731 State banks converted Into 'National.- Whole namber of Na tional banks to Nov. I, is 1,601, of which 679 were new, and 922 conversions from State institutions. Two banks have failed.' The result of the conversion has. been rather id diminish than to increase tbe circulation. The National bank notes in circulation Oct. 1, were $17!, 321,903; State banks,. $78,667,575; le gal tender .and fractional currency, (04,584,658. Including bank notes not issued, the whole amount of the nouinal circulation .at that date was $1,083,452,233; from which the Con- troller makes large deductions in order to arrive at tbe actual circulation. Na tional bank notes not delivered to banks are $109,152,945; legal tender held by banks, $193,094,365; compound interest notes, mostly held in investments, $121, 314,195; currency in U. S. Treasury, $56,236,440; ..altogether, $499,323,097; leaving the actual circulation 94bU,oV 229. It is recommended that as tbe most efficient means to curtail expansion, a system of compulsory redemption at tbe financial centers be adopted. Tbe em ergency which required an irredeemable paper -earrency no longer existing, re sumption of specie payments should en sue at the earliest possible moment. As one step toward it, the tariff should be -- . . . so aojaeieu as io discourage inorainaie importations;-increasing-the tanfi as gold and foreign exchange recede in price. Internal taxation at the same time should be simplified. In . addition to $120,000,000 from the tariff, the Con troller s 'estimates are $100,000,000 on bisky. malt" liquors, " and domestic ines; $15,000,000 on tobacco; $125,- 000,000 on cotton; $15,000,000 from stamps ;1$20.0OOlOOO from licences; $10,- 000.000 from premiums on surplus of goldi ih'fbe aeregate $405,000,000, a sum probably $100,000,000 in excess of expenses, the whole or part ot which could bo to tbe yearly reduction ot tbe debt.-, . By restricting the Internal Reve nue tax to a few articles the cost of its coUecUou would be greatly diminished, and dissatisfaction with the law be abat ed. The Controller protests warmly against all schemes of State taxation of National securities as a violation of public faitb, and proposes the transfer of the bureau which he administers from Washington to New York, as demanded by. economy nd convenience.. Beport of the Postmaster-General. The Postal Department has been again .more than eelf-suBtaining during the bacal, year ending June 3U, lsua, tbe revenue being $14,556,158 70, and the expenditures $13,694,723 23, leaving a surplus ot abi,4JU4Z. lhe service uas bea a per caat more costly and .17 per,cept more- proaucuve than tne pre vious Tear, iue average denciency tor the past 24 years has been $1,283,023 61 per annum? wbicn bad to be met by special appropriation, .lhe estimates of ithaO'tAP 1866 and 1867 contemplate a' deficiency, f $1,207,457,- which is more'than provided- for- in unexpended appropriations.

American steamers the whole of. the postage of letter carried, and to foreign steamers the sea postage Only, tbe latter amounting to an -aver age of z,y7U per trip last year. The advantages of such competition rather than subsidizing national steamers are clearly set forth.

The law requiring the advertising in the newspaper of largest circulation it is found is very expensive, and discretion is urged in its stead.
