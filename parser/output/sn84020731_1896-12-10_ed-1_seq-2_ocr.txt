The PensioD Bureau spends more money than any other one department of the government. The annual expense now of pay ing off those who "saved the union" amounts to one hundred and forty million dollars, and 'still they come" is the cry; In his annual report recently the Secretary of the Interior says that "when we consider that 970,078 persons are receiv ing assistance from the gov. ernment to the extent ot $140, 000,000 per annum, tne impor tance of the Pension Burea and the necessity for the exercise of care and discretion in the con duct of the business are appar ent." He adds that the policy has been to make the pension list a roll of honor rather than to 6ave money for the depart ment. It is all right to pension those who risked their lives to save the flag of the union. They should he pensioned. But it i now 32 years since the war closed and still there are over nine hundred thousand on the pension "rol? of honor." If all this number arc old soldiers and their widows every man, wo man and child in the south must have "winged a yankee." In 1866 the number of pension ers on the list were 120,722 and in 1890 just 3t) years later there are 970,678: an increase of 45,950. New names are to be ing added every day while it is only now and then that one is reported dead. Those who re ceive pensions must live to a "ripe old age." THE FniEXDS OP CCB. DISAP- POINTED. The annu.i message of Presi dent Cleveland was read in Congress Monday. It was very long and confined about eigb teen thousand words. The coming of the message has been looked forward to with much interest by the peo ple of this, and almost all other nations, and more especially by those whj are interested in the fearful war that is now being waged in Cuba by the patriots, on one side, who are seeking to throw off the yoke of oppres sion, such as has scarcely ever been known in the world's his tory, and by the Spanish gov ernment on the other, who are Keeking to bring the noble, brave people back into submis sion. The message is a fcad disap pointment to those who have a friendly feeling for the Cubans and that means a disappointment to the majority of the Ameri can citizens. It was hopad that Mr. Cleveland would, for the sake of suffering Lumanity, re commend that the government of the United States interfere at once and put a stop to the awful and merciless butchery that is now being carried on in Cuba by Weyler, "the butcher," under the direction pf the Spanish government. But he did not re commend any such a thing. The bloated Wall Street shark, who ha disregarded every other will and df ire of the American peo plj oxcept the desires of the trust) has now disappointed tb m again. He starts off by saying that "the insurrection io Cuba still continue with all it perplex ities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress1 has thus far been made towards the pacifica tion of the Island or that the situation of affairs at depre cated in my last annual mes sage has in the least improved." He then dwells at length upon the condition of affairs in Cuba, the American interests at stake there and then says; "When the inability of Spain to deal successfully Willi the In-1 surrection has become manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is exinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishmen' has degenerated into a etr -which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of bu man life and the utter destruc tion of the very subject matter of conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obliga- gations to the sovereignty 01 Spain will be superceded by igher obligations, which we nan naraiy nesitate to recog uize and discharge." In one paragrah he acknowl edges the inability of Spain to put down the rebellion; he speaks of the terrible crimes that are now being committed there and then a little later quielty asserts that we will in terfere when it is apparent that Spain is powerless to re-estab lish its government and when the war has degenerated in "noalocc aarrifir-fl nf human life." Ia the name of humanity what does he consider a "useless sacrifice of life ?" If it has not already reached that point, when, in his opinion, will it "degenerate" to that depths? How many more thousand of innocent women must be out raged; how many more helpless laborers roust be murdered be fore the time for this govern ment to inteifere has come ? Concluding what he has to say about the Cuban war, Mr. Cleve- laud says: "A contemplation of emergea cies that may arise shoul-i pl.Jnly load us to avoid their Citation, either throuch a careless disre gard ol present duty or even un undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of teeliDg. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the congress that a time may ar rite wheu a correct policy and care for our interests as well as regard for the interests of ether uations and their citizens joined by consi-Iv-alious of huraau. y and it desire to see a rich and fer tile country, intimately related to us, saved from complete devasta Hon, will constrain our govern ment to such action as will sub serve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to uba and its inhabitants an op- wrtunity to eujoy the blessing ol u peace." Again we say the message is a sad disappointment to the Amer ican people. We hope congress will take a different view of the matter and recognize the Cubans as belligerents at once. 

UKOVKK AGAIN. President Cleveland's message has relieved the situation with those papers hunting for some thing to comment on, and with some them of the relief was great. The part of his message which has attracted most attention, and the ambiquity of which has been so differently construed, is that which relates to the Cuban uestion,uppermost in the Amer ican mind since the result of November 3d was made public. Though Mr. Cleveland has learned the English language to perfectly he can use words to conceal his real meaning, and though on the Cuban question "he wires in, and win out,'' 'till you are in doubt v.jether the hand that made the mark, knew what it was about, yet it has received notice from high authority across the "salt pond." The St. James Uazette.of Lon don, a leading English political journal, has this comment: "The condition in Cuba undoubtedly gives the t'nited States the right to call upon f";-.ain to enforce her authority speedily, or acknowl edge that her Inability to sr y press anarchy has deprived her of her right to be considered as governing the Island. Other European papers ex press the opinion that the pres ident will defer toy action In the matter shifting the re fponsibilitjr upon the other fel 'ow, Maj. McKlnley, a rather delicate intimation that be will adhere to bit tactics daring the. war, and get a substitute when ever there is appearance 01 danger ahead. Summed up, the concensus of foreign opinion seems to be that Grover is act ing more for tne protection of Spain's honor than the fair fame of the United States. The Clerk In Contempt. Oxford, N. C, Dec 7 (Special to News and Observer) In the matter of appoiutment of two county commissioners, as provid ed by the last legislature, Judge Graham today fined J. M. Sikes, clerk of the court, two hundred and fifty dollars, and sent him to jail for contempt, there to remain until he should purge himself of the contempt .... i The facts briefly are that the clerk refused to certify to the Judge that the requisite number of electors and free holders had signed the petition, and a rule was served on him Saturday re quiring him to appearand show cause why he should not certify as required by law. Having ap peared and answered therule, the Judge adjudged his answer insuf ficient and directed him to make the certification, it being proven to the court and the clerk that the required number had signed tne petition. inecicrK tuen re fused to certify as directed," and he was adjudged in contempt Application for writ of habeas corpus was made to Judge Mc Iver, and he granted the writ re turnable before Chief Justice Fair- cloth in Raleigh Tuesday. Judge Graham then appointed W. L. Lvon and G. B. Royster the two commissioners excel lent appointments. The popu list-republican board declined to recognize the appointees of the Judge; thereupon counsel pro cured an injunction from Judge Mclver enjoining the commis sioners from doing any act and requiring them to appear before Judge Graham' December 14th, and show cause why they should not permit Lyon and Royster to qualify. Prosperity ! Mexico. Tne Asnevme citizen says: "Prof. J. M. Tiernan was in town yesterday and today, re turning to Salisbury this after noon. He is just from Mexico and on the way to Chicago to buy mining machinery. Prof. Tiernan is engaged Io gold min ing about 90 miles from the Pacific in Mexico, and will re turn thetce In about three weeks. His interests there are continually growing more im portant and prosperous, and re quire alt his time. He reports Mexico as the most prosperous country on earth today, and says that money is, if anything, too plentiful there. Capital is pouring into the country, labor is well remunerated and silver dollars form the sola current fund cf the people." Hia Portrait XntllaMd. Chicago, III., Dec. 7. The picture of President Cleveland which hung In the rooms of the Cook county Democratic Club has ueen cut to pieces. The erpetra tors of the deed are unknown. It is rapposed to be the result of the strife between the gold and silver wings of the party which reached its height at the annual club election yerterday. The picture which was one of the largest and finest of the president in existence was painted in Buffalo and brought to the National conven tion ot by the Buffalo Demo crats, who presented the portrait to the Cook county democracy. KaM for CalM. Kasas Citv, Mo., Dee. 8 The Board of Trade bxs unanimously adopted the following self-ex. planatory resolution: "Ws respectful! ask the president and congress ct the United States to acknowledge the Independence of the Cuban republic and grant them mate rial assistance to stop the cruel war that If being waged upon the people f Cuba. We oelieve that the war being waged upon them Is mora merciless thao the persecutions of the Armenians by the Turks." " An Exulting nido. Thiscanyou was named by the late Lieut Frederick Schwartk a in honor of Gen. Nelson A. Miles, who had beeu instrumental iu sending him on his trip to the Yukon in 1883. The river, which has beeu about 300 foot wide sud denly contracts to about a tenth of that width, aud, increasing its velocity to twenty miles an hour, rushes with terrific force through a canyon with absolutely perpen dicular walls a hundred feet high. The canyon is only three-quar ters of a mile loug, aud at its low er end the river spreads out into a series of rapids, culminating three miles below in the Ahite Horse, There are two ways of passing this canyon, one by portaging over the hill on the east bank and the other by boldly running through We had seen both ways of passing Miles canyon, one requiring four days and the other two minutes. We three looked at each other in an inquiring sort of way, and then without a word walked down to where the Nancy Hanks was moored against the bank. All took their places, kneeling and tacing the bow, McConnell in the stern, Mattera amidships and I forward. The oars were placed on board, and each of us used an ordinary canoe paddle. . I must confess that I never felt sicker in my life than as we shoved away from shore and steered for the entrance. It was all over so quickly that wi hardly knew how it happened Barely missing the big rock at the mouth of the canyon, the starting we heard a cheer from the rocks above, but we did not dare to look up. By franctic paddling we kept in the middle and from the canyon walls. The sensation was akin to that of riding a bucking broncho. There was not a dry spot on one of us when we got through, and the boat bad taken on so much water that she nearly found' ered before we could bail her out. But a great weight was off our minds, for Miles Canyon, more than all other thiogs, is dreaded by Yukon travelers. Scribners' Magazine Methodism's Beginning. St. Louis, Dec. 8. An original copy 01 the first printed "Rules for the Society of the People call cd Methodist" was unearthed yes terday in this city. It was pub lished by John and Charles Wesley over their own signet u res, ia 1743, and contains the first nucleus of the literature of the Methodist Church, which now numbers over 5,000,000 members iti the United States, worshipping iu 63,000 religious edifices of their own. The circular is of four pages and is falling to pieces with age tnd handling. The paper Is yel low and the print unreadable in places from the stabs of time. Although most of the pronouns in the document are la the first per sons singular, it is signed "J. and C. Wesley," the date is May 1, 1743, and at the bottom is. the imprint: Printed "by Cordeaux, 14 City Road, London. Will F.mbarraa Grow. Washikctox, December 8.
