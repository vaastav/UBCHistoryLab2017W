'N THE RAILWAY WORLD. A General Reduction in Freight Rates Reported from Chicago to the Missouri River, Which, It Is Now Claimed, WiU Result in the Loss of $10,000,000 Annually. Gen. McNulta, the Wabash Receiver, Evidently Bound to Hake Things Lively. The meeting of the general managers of the Western roads has resulted in a general reduction of rates which will extend from Chicago to Missouri river points and up and down the river from Sioux City to Council Bluffs or further. This is ■ general sweeping reduction to take effect probably January 1. but pos sibly as early as Dec. 30. This result has been brought about by the railroad companies themselves, of their own vo lition, and with no other pressure ex cept that exerted among them selves. The rates were for the first five classes 90. 75, 59, 35, 30. They are now reduced to -.-», 00. 40. 90, 25, and so^ou to the lowest class, which is about 10 per cent. The estimated loss Of the roads in consequence of this re duction is placed at $10,000,000 annually, and every dollar of this sum comes out of the net ear-nines. The Illinois dis tance tariffs are already arranged, the lowa representatives are busily at work getting their distance tariffs En shape so as to harmonize with the new reduced through rates, and Chairman Midgley has issued a call for the Missouri inter ested roads— Chicago « Alton, Burling ton. Hock Island. Missouri Pacific, Han nibal A: St. Joe. Milwaukee & St. Paul, Wabash and Fort Scott and Culf— to meet at Cliicago Wednesday next to take up the work. in speaking of this widespread reduction the Chicago Times declares that "the trouble has been pre cipitated on the lines by their own greed and their anxiety to get business from Eastern roads on a pro rata that has ended in costing them $100 for every dollar gained by the interchange. It does not make a tuppence different which road was primarily responsible: whether it was the Wabash, which for six months made a 13-cenl lower rate from Toledo to St. Louis than from Chi cago, and then suddenly discovered that it was a crying injustice to this city; the Rock Island, which held Daven port's and Rock Island's interests above that of all the remainder of the line: the Burlington, which is charged with secretly prorating while maintaining a virtuous outward appearance, or any of the others. First or last, they cuddled the Eastern roads and allowed them to make the through rates and ignore the Chicago termini. New they are about to reap the harvest, and the crop is a bad one for them." Cutting Wabash Rates. Chicago, Dec. 9.— Delegations of prominent merchants, manufacturers and shippers from Springfield, Quiney. Jacksonville, Decatur, HI., and Hanni bal. Mo., were in Chicago to-day to thank Gen. McNulta, the receiver ofthe Wabash railroad, for a reduction of the state tariff rates, which will take effect Dec. 90. After several addresses had been made by the delegates, giving to (Jen. McNulta the honor for the coming relief of the commerce of Illinois and for the outgrowing benefits in adjoining slates and in other roads throughout the Northwest, the general repned,reaffirm ing his intention of cutting down the rates from 10 to 39 per cent, the average reduction being alwnit 90 per cent. Shortly afterward the general sent offi cial notices of this reduction, to take effect Dec. 20. to the Chicago & Alton, Chicago. Burlington & Quincy. Illinois Central and Chicago & Rock Island rail roads. Dulutli & iron Range Docks. Special to the Globe. Him i Minn., Dee. o.— The Dulutli * Iron Range road has just let to Brad fey & Hani* rd. Duluth lumbermen, a contract for 70,000 linear feet of piling for tin* new ore docks to be built this winter at Two Harbors. There will lie 1.000 feet of extentsion. 500 on each dock, about doubling their capacity. The entire structure is to be as firm as it is possible to make it with timl»er and iron. C. L.

CURRENT COMMENT. A great many people think that a K slngger." as A boxer is now denomi nated in the West is a sort of a human bull-dog. A large photograph of Tommy Warren is on exhibition at a Nicollet avenue sporting goods store, and it was curious to note the comments of the ladies, who from their habit of raping into store windows, of course noticed it. Tommy is a handsome little fellow and the photograph which showed him in stylish attire, drew out exclamations of surprise and admiration. "Why. I al ways supposed they looked tough." was the" comment of about two-thirds ofthe lair critics. The severe sentence that Loir Murray received lor his alleged assault upon Miss .Sylvester has created considera ble sympathy in his favor, and a fund is already being raised for the purpose of securing him a new trial. There is a general impression thai certain Influ ences were brought to bear against him: that witnesses were spirited away, and attorneys prevented from defending him. The chances are that a strong effort for a second trial will be made. William Welch yesterday delivered another invective "against ("en. Viias, Attorney Erwin and others whom he re gards as being his opponents in the libel suit against him. There's one thing about Mr. Welch— he is always interesting and invariably contributes home spicy newspaper reading when ever lie speaks. _____ SORTS. It is truly remarkable that Mayor Ames, Engineer Rioter, and Aid. K. M. Johnson should disagree upon the man ner in which the city work should be performed. The trio have always worked together* with such harmony(?). It is astonishing that Mayor Ames and Aid. Johnson should not agree. A fit companion for the famous "llawkshaw"' McKeirna, of Pillsbury's administration, is the recently discov ered in -Young Cyclone the Dectec tivo." The enterprising and sensitive Jour nal reporter who published that personal card in substantiating an alleged inter view with the eminent J. K. Ward, may perhaps have rioted that Tollefson's money box has not been recovered. It is seldom that Charles Balms goes running, but when he does be wants big game. It must have been an interesting Fight to see Col. .lames Fairman. the art ist, mixed up ma row over a dog light yesterday. There are men in the City who would have given a good deal of money to have seen the affair. According to the gentlemen who went to Washington to put in a bid for the national convention, crow is pretty good eating under some circumstances.. Col. Charles Johnson will, it is said, remove to Chicago in the near future. "-Strifes me," said a gentleman from Tennessee yesterday, as he surveyed the muddy streets, "that you have pe culiar weather here. One "day it will be so cold that frost will gather on your stoves: next day It rains, and you have to wear a rubber coat. The third day it snows, aud the next day it's warm enough to wear a straw hat and a linen duster. I'm coming here to live soon." It is now about the season when the young wife begins to think of making mince pies, and sends to the grocer's for three pounds of mincemeat for two pies. SOME SURPRISING EVENTS. That a man has actually been an ested for leaving his hatchway open so that pedestrians might fall in and be either killed or maimed for life. That the dress-parade Republicans did riot get there on the convention enterprise. The way the town has "limbered up. so to speak, and the fact that the highly moral Republican grand jury has de cided to let the saloonkeepers rest for a while. That an apparently energetic effort is being made to prosecute the venders of adulterated milk. That the severe sentence Murray re ! ceived is occasioning a revulsion of pub j lie feeling. That Minnesota should have mid : summer weather at this time of the ; year. That Rev. Co Lightly Morrill has kept j himself in a condition of comparative I quietude for several days. That the .Star-News does not attempt i lobe a little more original in its meth | ods. That a little fault has been found with I the actions of the police commission of i late.

SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: SATURDAY MORNING DECEMBER 10, 1887. THE STATE OF TRADE. Regular Weekly Review of the Commer- cial Situation. LEGITIMATE TRADE ACTIVE. Speculation in Products Takes a Down ward Agitation of the Tariff. New York. Dec. 9— R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade will say: Legitimate trade continues fairly active for the season, though embarrassed in some branches by the fluctuations in speculative markets. Speculation in products after a few days of wild ad vance, has taken a turn downward, as the natural result af enormous sales to realize. With rapidly expanding cur rency money is generally easier than a week ago. though rates are still high at many points, and complaints of slow collections do not diminish. Agitation of the tariff question already begins to cause revision of calculations for the future in some departments. The sharp decline in real estate speculations and prices, at some Southern and Western points, tends to check developments there, and .subject investors to some financial strain. Large sales of Besse mer iron at $18.50 are reported, and a sale of steel rails, netting J3l at mill, has been made. Buyers still are back ward, but brokers "openly offer below i*?*'.-.'. Virginia pig iron. No. 1. is offered at 130 for delivery where freight is $1.20, and some Alabama iron for future de livery at low prices. One Thomas turn ace goes out of blast, and the i.ehigh strike causes some embarrassment. Coal has declined about 81; orders slackening. Woolens do not improve in demand, and heavy goods open, in some cases, below last year's prices, so that manufacturers arc not encouraged to increase their purchases of raw wool, which appears rather weak. Raw cot ton has declined an eighth, but goods are held at recent advances. The boot and shoe trade is large and promising, with exceptionally good payments and cheaper material, but there is complaint that competition cuts down prices too far. Leather is weaker, but tanners reason that after seven years' decline prices are low enough. The movement ot freight westward shows an increase of 15,000 tons for November, and east bound shipments are increasing, but the bank exchanges of all cities outside of New York begin to fall below those of last year. The decline at all cities last week was 14.3 per cent, and outside New York 2.0 per cent. At most inte rior points trade is reported fair for the season, but collections are "slow and have to lie forced" at Atlanta, slow at Detroit, fair at Memphis and Omaha, and rather better at Kansas City. Money at Chicago is in unabated de mand at 7 per cei\, and operators bid 8 lor funds to carry products at interior towns. Eastern bills are quoted! at par, bank balances at New York having been drawn as low as is convenient. Though the money markets are on the whole easier.the pressure at speculative centers continues. The treasury has paid out for the week ,000,000 more than it has taken in, and since July 10, has increased the aggre gate circulation $53,000,000. Exports from New York for five weeks are 7 per cent below and imports •*> per cent above those of the same week Inst year. Wheat speculation reached 30.000,000 bushels on Tuesday, and 105,000.000 for the week, and prices advanced sharply.only to close a shade lower than a week ago. Corn and oats gained 3'*c for the week and oil is unchanged. Coffee has advanced Jt'e, and the excitement in metals has lifted copper l.c, ami tin nearly 1 cent per pound, but the reac tion in pork products takes prices a lit tle lower than a week ago. The aver age risk in food products since July 1 was a shade over it) per cent on Tues day, and it-is questioned whether the legitimate effect of a partial failure of crops has not been fully realized in prices, but the increasing supply of cur rency still tends to keep speculation active. Stocks have been weaker since congress met. though holders look for a better demand in January, when yearly dividends and profits come to be in vested. The total business failures for the United States and Canada this week were 254; corresponding week of last year 274. BAD FOR BLAINE. Anything But Favorable Com ments on the Unofficial Mes sage. New York, Dec. 9.— commenting on Mr. Blame's message the Times says: "This, then, is the sum of Mr. Blame's policy; and as lie is the leader of the Republican party at present it must be taken as the policy of the Re publicans until they repudiate it. It is not a policy they can go before the peo ple with. Tliere is too much common sense and too much every -day old-fash ioned honesty in the United States yet for the voters to be trapped by so reck less, so shallow, and so dangerous a scheme as this. They know that they are enormously overtaxed. They know that the surplus taxes are a constantly increasing peril to their business ami a steadily heavier drain on their resour ces. They will not follow, the leader who would tax them only to squander, and who would throw their money out of the treasury windows rather than lift the most onerous of the tariff duties on the materials of American indos- i ties.*' The Tribune says: "Mr. Blame. in Europe speaks as an American. "Mr. Cleveland in America speaks as a Brit ish manufacturer, anxious to be ad mitted without any charge to a share of the best and largest market in the world. Americans who make that mar ket have to bear the expense of self government in the natron, the states, the counties, cities and towns, and es pecially in the school districts, where competent American voters for the fut ure are trained. Without contributing a cent to these expenditures, British manufacturers want to share in that market and to break (town American industries by their competition, their large capital and their under-paid labor. Mr. Cleveland appears as the attorney for the British interest in this contro versy, and Iris words move Mr. Blame to indignant protest.'" The World says: "The Maine states man's interview is in fact a proclama tion that Mr. Blame consider-- himself to be the chosen champion of protection and that he is ready to enter tire presi dential lists again" as such. The fact that Mr. Blame had not read the full text of the president's message must serve as his excuse for misrepresenting its purport. Mr. Blame is behind the | times on this question. The people of this country are bent upon stopping the surplus, instead of squandering or di viding it. They believe that the only honest place, as well as the best place, for every dollar not needed for the le gitimate expenses of the government is in the pocket of the man who earned it. President Cleveland stands for this purpose. Mr. Blame comes forward as the champion of the opposite idea. The Democratic party could not ask for a better issue.*' The Sun says: "If Brother Blame entertains such loose notions of the re lations between the federal government and the states.it strikes us that he would j be a conspicuously unfit person to in- j trust with the nation's financial affairs." Chicago, Dec. The Tribune this morning, commenting editorially on Mr. Blame's reply to President Cleve land's message, says: "Mr. Blame, as 'might have been ex pected, has presented high tariff from a partisan 'mint of view, as an opposition issue to the president's views mi tariff reduction. We have a long and appar ently very pleasant winter before us In which to discuss this question, and it is a question which must be settled en tirely upon its Merits and not upon po litical considerations. So far, therefore, a- Mr. Blame seeks to make it appear as a party issue, lie will fail. It is a sufficient explanation of Mr. Blame's interview that he i- I Pennsylvania!!. He was brought up in an atmosphere of ultra-protection. He has sat at the feet of the high-tariff Gamaliels of that state and imbibed, their doctrines. Like all Pennsylva nians. Republicans and Democrats, he believes in enormous duties on imports . for the purpose of coddling the mill tosses and protecting the so-called 'in fant industries,* which long ago came of age and ought to be able to go alone. Every Pennsylvania!! believes that the protective system promotes his interests, and that in promoting his interests jt j enhances the general good of the public. It is almost needless to say that Mr. Blame, as well as other Pennsylvania Republicans in taking this position,. makes no account of the precedents #f. 1857. of 188*2-88, or of the platform, of 1884, which explicitly declares: 'The Republican party pledges itself to cor rect the irregularities of the tariff and i to reduce the surplus.' They even: fought the small reductions of 1883.: The Blame interview will have to stand upon its merits, and it will be indorsed or condemned in accord ance with the value of the argu ments set forth, and the public jiutg ment will not be influenced by the dis tinguished name behind them. It is the weakest ground Mr. Blame has ever yet occupied, and no national party can expect to go into a presidential cam paign on that issue, no matter who may be its leader, and win. It is in a posi tion of direct hostility to the report of the tariff commission and to the Repub lican platform of 1884. Upon this ques tion, therefore, we beg leave to differ from Mr. Blame, as he differs from us. Freely acknowledging his right to his own belief, as a Republican we claim the same right as such another, free to state our belief, that in leading the co horts of the coddled state of Pennsyl vania with his lieutenants — Kelly. Cameron and McPherson— he will find that Pennsylvania is but one state, and that there is a large army out side its borders who do not propose to be levied upon any longer for its benefit. "The surplus question must be settled in some way. and in a different way from what it has been settled. It can not be settled in accordance with the Blame idea."

CHOLERA. Dr. Ranch Thinks the Louisiana Authorities Have Not Taken Proper Precautions. Spuing fiki.i). 111. Dec., 9.— Dr. Ranch, secretary of the state board of health, upon learning that the Alesia had arrived at New Orleans with GOO immigrants from the cholera-infected districts of Italy, had the following telegraphic correspondence with Dr. Joseph Holt, president of the Louisiana state board of health : "Is there any truth in the report that the Alesia has'arrived at New Orleans from Palermo with over COO passengers from the cholera-infected districts of Italy?'' To this President Bolt made a reply as foi lows : "The steamship Alesia left Palermo Nov. ii. with 014 immigrant passengers and an English surgeon on board. Clean bill of health : no ease of sickness on voyage ; vessel exceptionally clean. Arrived at quarantine Dec. 4: detained three days. Extra careful disinfection of every article of baggage, ship ap parel and entire vessel. Reports from surgeon, captain and from \\ ashington indicate no cholera in Italy during past month." On receipt of the above Dr. Rauch sent the following reply: "Regret that you did not detain the Alesia and passengers longer. Twice has cholera been introduced into this country, via New Orleans, at this season of the year. No reliance at this time on the reports of the surgeon, captain and Washington authorities in regard to the existence of cholera in Italy during the, past month. Why was the Alesia sent, to New Orleans instead of to New, York?" A Religious Festival. Ei. Paso, Tex..
