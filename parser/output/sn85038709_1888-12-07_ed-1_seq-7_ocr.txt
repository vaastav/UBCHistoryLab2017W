SYNOPSIS OP THE MESSAGE. The president's message opens with n re minder trat this session of congress wid mark the close of a century of constitution al existence. Ho reminds congress that the constitution was the chart of guidance laid down by the fathers of the country, and that departure from It means failure of our institutions. Ho draws a bright picture of the country's growth, but says that "upon more carelul inseetiou wo tind the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unrerauner atlve labor. A crowed and constantly In creasing urban popui tiou suggest the im jHwerishment of the rural sections and dis content with agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's simple and laborious Hie, joins the eatror chase for easily ho juired wealth, and so economic conditions have becorno difticult of solution. We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no long er solely a reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from tho discriminating favor or tho govern meut und are largely built upon undue ex action from the masses of our people. Tho gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening and classes are rat idly form mr, one-. comprising the very rich und H)werful, while iu another are found the toiling poor. "As we v.ew tho rchlevement of aggre gated capital, we discover t lie existence of trusts, (v.mbina ions and nnwoHe, while the eiti'en is struggling far in the rearer is trampled to death beneath an iron heeL Corporations, wi ich should 1? the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the ser vants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters. Still, conpratulatingour aelves ujoti the wealth and prosperity of our country, and complacently contemplat ing every incident of ch miro inseparable from these conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire, at tho present stage of our progress, how the bond the government made with the people has been kept and ierforiiied. lustcad of It it. i ing the tribute drawn from r.ur citizens to tho necessities of its 1 economical administration, the government persists in exacting from tho substance of the jKOple midions which, unapplied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation a Id to the extortion atd tho danger attending the diversion of the cur rency of thocoun'ry from the legitimate channels of business. Un ier the same laws by which these results are produced, tle government jtermits many millions more to be added to the est of tho living of our peop e and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profl s of a small but p iwerfui m'nority. The people must still be t:ied for the supiort of the government under the operation of tariff laws; but to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened be yond any useful public purposes and for the benefit of a favored few, the government, under pretext of an overcise of its tax ng power, enters gratuitously into partnership with thc favorites, to their advantage and to the in'urv of a vast major! v of our people. This is not equality before the law." After the prelude the president argues that such conditions are injurious to the nation, making the government an instru ment for private gain; and he says that the farmers and laborers will see only too soon that they are being tixed under un unjust theory of taxation, without compensatory favor. When this discontent and the self ishness of the beneficiaries of protectee tariffs are rralbed. we will realize that the beneficent purposes of our government are endangered. "Communism Is a hateful thing, and a menace to pe:ico and organized government. Hut the communism of com bined wealth an I capital, tre outgrowth of overweening cu i id ty and selfishness, whic h inaiduously uudermines the Justice and in tegrity of free institutions. Is not less dan gerous than the communism of oppressed poverty, which, exasperated by Injustice and discontent, attacks w.th wild disorder the citadel of rule. "There are oopla who propose that the government shall protect the rich and that they in turn will care for tho laboring poor. Any intermediary t.etwoen the people and their government, or the least delo ration of the care and protection tho government owes to tho humblest citizen In the land, makes the boast of free institutions a glit tering d dusion, and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless imposi tion. "A Just and sensible revision of our tariff lnws should be made for tho relief of those of our countrymen who suffer under pres. ent conditions. Such a revision should re ceive the support of all who love that Jus tice and equality duo to American citizen ship; of all who realize that in this Justice and equality our government finds its strength and it power to protect tho cit renand his projierty; of all who believe that the contented competence and comfort of the m ny accord better with the spirit of our instttntions than colossal fortunes, un fairly gathered, in the hands of the few; of all who appreciate that the forbearance, and fraternity among our people, which recompense the value of every American interest, are the surest guarantee of our national pro-jre-s, and of all who desire to ;e the products of American skill and in genuity in every market of the world, with a result ng restoration of American com merce" i Paternalism of government Is strongly d YKunced, and the pietext of the wealth of the government being sufficient excuse for extravagant expenditure combated. In thui class of false theory comes pensions granted on no other ground than the appli cant's need, pr vate relief bills, etc, wbieh have oon-jc-ted congressional work and prevented con (deration of really import ant pubi c at airs. Among tho business so avoided wer measures for the relief of tho supreme court; for United States prisons; for an equitable land law; and for revision of the pension laws. Furthermore, under plea of servinir the public good, there has been great laxity in observing the parti tions that divide proper fields of federal and stato legislation; and closing this por tion of his message, he quotes Andrew Jackson's peroration on the constitution. The president argue then on the neces sity of tariff reform boing patent to all and says it should be honestly met and effective ly remedied. A plan should be effected, fair and conservative toward existing in dustries, but which will reduce the oost to consumers of the necessaries of life, while It provides for our manufacturers the ud vautiige of freer raw m.iterbds and permits no injury to tho interests of Amorican la bor.' Dealing with tho stato of the union, the president says foreign relations havo been strengthened. Tho international questions which still await settlement aro all reason ably within the domain of a capable nego tiation, and there is no existing subject of dispute between tho United States and any foreign power that is not suKcentiblo of satisfactory adjustment by frauk diplo matic troatmt-nt. "The questions between Great Britain and the United States relating to tho rights of American fishermen under treaty and International comity in tho territorial waters of Cauada and Newfoundland, I regret to say, aro not satisfactorily ad justed." He recites tho diplomatic history of those disputes. Ho then goes on and says: "Having essayed in tho discharge of my duty to procure by negotiation the settle ment of a long standing cause of dispute and to remove a constant menace to tho good relations of the two countries, and continuing to be of tho opinion that tho treaty of February last, which failed to receive the approval of tho senate, did sup ply u satisfactory, practical and final ad justment upon a basis honorable and Just to both parties of tho difticult and vexed questiou to which it related,' aud having subsequently and unavalliugly recommend ed other legislation to congress, which I hoiHMl would sofllco to moot the exigency created by tho rejection of tho treaty, I now again iuvoko tho earn est and Immediate attention of tho congress to the condition of this Important question as It now stands before them and the coun try, and for tho settlement of which I am deeply solieitlous. Near tho close of the month of October last, occurrences of a deeply regretable nature were brought to my kcowled.'o which made it my painful but imperative duty to obtain with as little delay as possible, a new personal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the government of Great Britain. "Tho correspondence in relation to this lncideut will, in due course, be laid before you, and will disclose tho unpardonable conduct of tho official referred to, in his in terference by advice and counsel with the suffrages of American citizens in tho very crisis of tho presidential election near at hand, and also in his subsequent public declarations to Justify his action, suieradd ing impugnment of tho executive and sen ate of the United States, in connection with important questions now pending in contro versy between the two governments. "The offense thus committed was most grave, luvolvlng disastrous possibilities to tho good relation of the United States and (irout Britain, constituting u gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domestic affairs and essential aoverignity of the government to which tho envoy was accredited. Having first fulfill ed the just demand of international comity. by affording full opportunity for herma;es ty's government to act in relief of tho situa tion, I considered prolongation of the dis cussion to be unwarranted, and thereupon declined to further recognle the diplomatic character of the jterson wboo continuanco in such function would destroy the mutual confidence which is essential to tho good understanding of tle two governments, and was inconsistent with the welfare and self respect of the government of the United States." A survey of the Alaskan boundary is recommended. An arraugement with (ireat Hritain looking to the removal of obstacles to tho humane relief of shipwrecked bailors on tho great lakes is suggested. Tho relations with France on the im press'ngof American ritiens into its mili tary serviie, and the relations with Samoa and China on the restriction act. are retold. Tho convention with Japan is still in prog ress. A consular coui t in Con a is recom mended. Our r. preventative in Haytl has been instructed to abstain from interfer ence in the revolution now en there, while due precautions for the observance of neutrality laws have been taken. Sub marine telegraph connection with Honolu lu is recommended. A precise location of the Mexican boundary lino is urged tr avoid future complications. Claims of American citizens against the foreign gov ernments have been amicably settled. Tlie president theu takes up the question of naturalization, deal ng with It thus: "With the rapid in reuse of immigration to our shores and tho facilities of modern travel, abuses of the generous privileges afforded by our naturalization laws call lor their careful revision. Tho easy and un-gu-irjed manner in which certificates of American citizenship can be obtained has induced a cla-s, unfortunately large, to avad themselves of the opportunity to be come absolved from allegiance to their native land, and yet by a foreign residence escape any Just duty and contribution of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus, while evading the duties of citizenship to to United States, they may make prompt claim for its national protection, and demand its Intervention in their behalf. International complications of a serious tiatuie arise and tho corres pondence of the state department discloses tho great number and complexity of tho questions which have been ra.sed. Our laws regulating tho issue of passports should be care tully revised, and tho insti tut on of a central bureau cf registration at the capital is again strongly recommend ed. Hy this meaus full particulars of each case of naturalization in the United States would be secured and prcrly re corded, und thus many cases of spurious citizenship would te detected and unjust responsibilities would be avoided. "The reorganization of the consular ser vice is a matter of serious iniortanoe to our national interests. The number of ex isting princ pal consular officers is believed to be greater than is at all necessary for the louduct of the public business. It need not be our policy to maintain more than a moderate number of principal officers, each supported by a salary sufficient to enable the incumbent to live in comfort and so distributed as to secure convenient sujer visiou over a considerable district, I re- 1eatthe recommendations heretofore mado y mo, that the appropriations for the maintenance of our diplomatic and consular service should bo recast; that tho so oalled notarial or unofficial duties which our ro resentatives abroad are now permitted to treat as personal erquis tes, should be tor bidden; that a system of consular inspec tion should be instituted ; and that a limited number ol secretaries of legation at large should be authorizd." The preparat ions for a centennial of the inaugura ion of Washington, to be held at New York, aro adverted to. The message then goes on to deal wHh the rejKrts of the various departments, heretofore sent out by the press. The sur plus in the treasury is put at f 

I04,(MM),IKK). The money saved bv purchase of Imnds not yet due is put at I J7,lti.,0i0. At first sight this would scorn to be a profitable and sen sible transact. on on tho part of the govern ment, but as suggested by tho secretary of the treasury, thesurplus thus oxpenddfor tho purchase of bouds was money drawn from the people in excess of any actual need of the government, ami was so ex pended rather than allowed to remain In tho treasury. "If this surplus under tho oieration of Just and equitable laws had been left In tho hands of tho people. It wou'.d havo teen worth in their bus noss at least six per cent ier annum. Deducting from the amount of interest upon the prin cipal pnd p-emium of these bonds for the time they had to run, at the rato of six per cout, the saving of two er cent mado for tho people by tho purchase of such bonds, the loss will appcarto I e V,7M,u0. "With regard to silver coinage, tho see retary of the treasury recom mentis the sus pension of the further coinage of silver, and in such recommendation I earnestly concur. For further valuable information and timely recommendations, I ask the careful attention of the congress to the sec- ' retary's report." Tho reiorts or the war department are given In abstract and tho recommendations concurred In. The death of (Jen. Shorldan is spoken of thus: ''The doath of lien. Sheritlan in August last was a national affile! Ion. Tho army then lost tho grand estof its chiefs; the country lotn brave and experienced soldier, a vlso and discreet counselor aud a modest and sensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his ersonal association will never fail to p y deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career; but they will cherish with more tender jienalbility the loving memory of his simple, generous and considerate nature." The movement for the return or mo Apa che prisoners to their reservations is spok en of as a dangerous and ill-judged piece of philanthropy. Tho report or the secretary or the navy is given In abstract and the recommend itions approved. The same disposition is made of the postmaster general's report, published to day, and recommendations made of legis lative readjustment of much of its machin ery. The president favors Mr. IMekinsou's rlan to place the erection or postofnoo build ngs in the hands of the department, on a basis of business dono. Much legislation, reasonable and proper at tho time it was made, is out of date to day, and should bo revised for the benefit of the postal estab lishment. The work of the department of Justice Is related, special attention boing called to tho prosecution, in Utah, or offenders against anti-polygamy laws, and tho opinion is ex pressed thut under such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws, and tho advance of Ideas opposed to the forbidden practices, polygamy within tho United Statos Is virtu ally at an end. Secretary Vilas' report has onof'a4uro called attention to, that relating to public lands "We have no excusu for tho v.o'a tlon of principles cogently taught by reason and example, nor for tho allowance of pro texts which have sometimes exposed our lands to colossal greed. Laws which open tho door to fraudulent acquisition, or admin istration which perm ts favor to rapacious seizure by a favored few of expanded areas that many should en'oy. aro accessory to offenses against our national welfare and humanity, not to be too severely condemned or punished. Our doar experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment of measures of legislation which will confine tho future disposition of our remaining agricultural lauds to the uses of actual hus bandry and genuine homes. Nor should our vast tracts of so-called desert lands he yield ed up to the monopo'y of corporations or grasping individuals, us appears to be much tho tendency under tho existing statute. Tho lands require but tho supply of water to become fertile and productive. It is a problem of great moment how, most wisely for the public good, that factor shall b furnished. I cannot but think it perilous to suffer either these lands or the sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies." Legislation for tho adjustment of stato grants is recommended, in trie equal Inter est of the nation, tho states and tho set tlers. The failure of the Sioux land treaty is related. The number of rensionors added to tho rolls during the fiscal year ended Juno 3), iss. is vo.23, and the Increase of pensions was granted in 45.7i cases. The names t lf,730 pensioners wero dropjied from tho rolls during tho year for various causes, and ut the close of the year tho number of persons of all classes receiving pensions w.is 4.72.r.V. Of these there wero MV survivors of tho war of 11'. 10,7.j7 widows of tl.oso who served in that war, 1(',(ki soldiers of tho Mexican war and 5,101 widows of said soldiers. One hundred and two different rates of tensions aro paid to these beneficiaries, ranging from F-i to $410 M jer month. Tho amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was $7.",(7, Nil i3. being an increase over the preceding year of :.OS.MiO 27. 'I am thoroughly convinced," tho presi dent says, "thut our general pension laws should be revisod and adjusted to meet as far us possible, in the Jigt.t of our experi encc. all meritorious cases. Tho fact that 01 different rates of pensions aro paid cannot, in my opinion, bo mado consistent with Jus tico to tho pensioners, or to tho govern ment; and the numerous private tension bills that aro passed predicated upon tho imperfection of the general laws, which. while they increase, in many cases, existing inequality and injustice, lend udditional force to tho recommendation for a revision of the general laws on tho subject. "The laxity of tho ideas prevailing among a largo number of our ieop:o regarding jmnsions is becoming every day more marked. Ihe principles upon which they should bo granted are in danger of being altogether ignored, and already pensions are often claimed becauso the applicants aro as much entitled as other successful applicants, rather than upon any disability reasonably attributable to military servico If tho estab.ishment of vie ous precedents bo oont.nw d, und the grunting of pensions bo not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant considerations. and if the honorable name of veteran un fairly becomes by these means but another term for one who constancy clamors for tho aid of the government, there is danger that injury will bo dono to tho fame and patriotism of many whom our citizens all delight to honor, and that a prejudice will be aroused un.ust to meritorious appuca tion for pensions." Tho work of tho agricultural bureau is related,andco-opcrat;on with the states rec ommended. The adjustment of the relations between the government and tho railroad companies which have received land grantst and the guaranty oi me puonc crouii in aia oi wo construction of their roads, should recoive early attention, and be treated as a puro!y business proposition. After making reeom mendutions relative to the District of Col umbia, tho president concludes as follows: "The consciousness that I have presented but an imperfect statement of tho condition of the country and its wants occasions no fear that anyth;ng omitted Is not known and appreciated by the congress, upon which rest the rcs)onsibility of intelligent legislation in behalf of a great nation and a e mflding people. As pubiio servants, we shall do our duty well 1& wo constantly puard the rectitudoof our intentions, main tain unsulied our love of country, and with unselfish jmrpose strive for tho public good." iuovEK Cleveland.
