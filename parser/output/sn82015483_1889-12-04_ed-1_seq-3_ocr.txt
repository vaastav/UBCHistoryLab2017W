Judge Wing's Argument for the De fense la Followed, br nr. lagtaant's Address In Behalf or tne Prosecution Ksinae Creates a Scene la tne Court Room. - ; . - Chicaoo, Deo. 3. Judge Wing resumed his argument in the Cronia trial this morn ing. After touching upon a number of minor points he took np the question of the canse of death, stating the law to be that the canse mnst be proved In accordance with the terms of the indictment, else a conviction oonld not follow. In this ease- it. was charged that Dr. Crenin died from the effeots of the in fiiotion of wounds and contusions on the head. The speaker went on to argue that this allegation was not proved, and that the experts in their testimony conld not say that the nature of the wounds on Dr. Oronin's head and face were snoh as to necessarily canse death. After Judge Wine had sharply criticised the testimony of the microscoplsts for the prosecution he closed his address and Mr. Ingham took np the argument on behalf of the prosecution. Attorney ingnam opened the afternoon session with a review of the events of the Carlson cottage. Everything was, he said, arranged for tne reception of the doctor at the cottage. The difficulty was, how was he to be gotten theiet The ice man had told the doctor that he would be called for by a man bearing his card. He said nothing about telephoning, a much speedier means. This was the contraot, and it was suoceasf nl. As for the hiring of the white horse that was very simply explained, Dlnan had supplied the police department for years with horses, and Conghlin knowing the liveryman's natur al retioenoe with police work had hired the none from .Dlnan tor his friend Smltn. -4 The attorney said the conspiracy moluded more men than those on trial, but, to the disappointment of the audience, hs men tioned no names. The acts of the conspiracy, he declared, were not buried forever only be cause, as in all large conspiracies, the heart of one man failed him. The accomplice who had been entrusted with the charge of bringing a boat to carry the body out into the lake was terrified and unable to carry out his part. The conspirators were there fore compelled to . dump the body into a sewer. It was their intention to take the dead man's clothing to - a foreign shore. there to be found on an unrecognizable body, but the failure of the boatman thwarted them. The speak er then attacked the alibi of O'Sullivan. The men who had furnished it with life were men whose livelihood had depended on the pros perity of the iceman, and it was but natural that they snonia aeeire to assist mm. xne attorney then referred to the part taken by Kunze in the conspiracy and asked why it was that the suspect admitted to a witness that he expected to be arrested in connection With the Uronin murder. Bed in the face, Kunze sprang from his chair and shouted in answer, "Beoause Coke told me." Two bailiffs tried to quiet him, but he kept on his feet for a moment, and raising his hands on high ha exclaimed with great earnestness: "uod knows 1 am innocent, Mr. Insham ended his address with a brief admonition to the jury to do Its duty.

The Galena and Eearsarge, Uncle Sam's old timers, sailed for Hayti on their secret mission this morning without the trim and haughty Dolphin. The Dolphin bad not received sailing orders when the time for departure came and will remain behind. The old Kearsarge looked first rate. The Galena flew Admiral Gherardi's flag fgom her masthead. Both ships had housed their mainmasts and foremasts previous to departure In order to pass under the Brook lyn bridge without scraping the lowsr cables. The first port the fleet will make will be Cape Haytlen. Then, Admiral Gherardl said last night, the ships will stop at Port au- Prlnoe, where the admiral, as a representa tive of the United States, will confer with Minister Douglas and President Hyppolite. The following three or four months will be spsnt by the cruisers among the West Indies. Thence they will sail northward. The main object of this oruise, it is said, is to make arrangements with the Haytien government for the establishment of a coaling station at Mole at. Hionoiaa. When the Galena waa last in Hsytlen wa ten her offioen wen royally entertained by a Mrs. JUatton, an American lady at Cape Hay tien. The offioen have planned a surprise for her in the shape of a silver bowl they have purobasea to present ner. The fleet should arrive at Cape Haytien by Sunday. If the Dolphin sails to-morrow she cad overtake the Kearsarge and the Galena be fore they get to Caps Usytien.

WASHINGTON NOTES. A Statement ot Estimates, Appropria tion and Expenditures ror the main tenance or the . Government for 1890-91 The Republican Senatorial Canons. Washington, Deo. 3. The clerks of the committees on appropriations of the Senate and House have prepared a comparative statement of estimates, appropriations and expenditures for the maintenance of the government for the fiscal years 1890 and 1891, from whloh it appears that the net in- oreass of the estimates for 1891 over those for.the current year is $20,867,168, and the net Increase of the estimates for the next year over the, appropriations for this year Is $38,093,112. The total estimates of regular and permanent annual appropriations for the next fiscal year are $496,843,315, while the total revenues are estimated at $450,414,337, showing an "excess of estimated revenues over estimated appropriations next year of $43,071,1)22. Tne net surplus for the pres ent year is placed at $53,532,611, or $9,961, 489 more than the estimated surplus for the next fiscal year. This prospective decrease in the surplus is stated, too, without ref erence to the possibility ot the enact- men of a river and harbor bill. for in estimates submitted by the Seoretary of the Treasury there Is a notable omission of the ordinary provision for river and har bor Improvements. or the preservation ot existing works the snm of KS37.UUO Is asked, while the report of the chief of engineers saya Xoo.ora.oou can De prontaoiy expended next year in these improvements. The statement above quoted differs materially from that prepared by the Treasury department asd exhibited ia the book ot estimates just issued for the reason that the postal receipts and revenues are differently treated by the treas urer and the appropriation committees.

After a long debate lasting from 10 o'oloek to after 4 o'olook a resolu tion passed to pay (250 a share for the stock from the surplus of the company. The syn dicate of directors, who have held the con trolling interest in trust since last spring, at once sold it in accordance with the terms of the trust to the company and it stands now in the name of Inauranoe Commissioner Fyler, who as trustee of the policy holders, will to-morrow eleot fifteen directors, all of whom mnst be participating policy holders. During a debate Vice-President Holeombe read a letter reoently sent by him to Insur ance Commissioner Fyler in which in the name of all the directors he offered to submit to legal tribunal the question whether divi dends heretofore paid atockholders in excess of six per cent, were legal, and if illegal to refund them at onoe. The law authorising the purchase of stock gave no power to the insurance commissioner beyond certifying that the price agreed to be paid did not im pair the company's surplus, and he testified this fact as to this purchase. Amendments fixing the price of the shares at $50 and $150 were lost. The final vote fixing $250 was passed yes, 4,151 policy holders with S7, 74o, 4U7 of insurance; no, 03 policy homers with $101,700 of insurance. ID It. GLADSTONE'S SPEECH. He Inspires His Hearers at Han- cnester With Enthusiasm His Ex position, or tha Liberal Policy Less Crime In Ireland Than in Est land. London, Deo. 3. Mr. Gladstone inspired great enthusiasm into his hearers at Man Chester by his definite exposition of the Liberal policy to-day. - He said Ireland is the leading question of the day; and that the Tories would have been converted to the Liberal view of the subject by .-this time but for. the - dissendent Liberals. The split in the Uberal party, he Baid, would not' have oe surred except for tha personal animosities of some toriea and their allies - who desired more to form " a national party than to do political jastioe. He severely arraigned the unionist leaders on this point. There was, he said, less crime in Ireland than' in England. He was of opinion that the country had dearly expressed the desire that there should be a change in the administra tion of Ireland, and the Liberals might loox to the f utnre with confidence. He was oheered with great spirit. Mr. Gladstone quoted the recent speecnes of Lord Salisbury and the Marquis of Hart ington sa evidence that the Unionist party is now formioe plans in anticipation or a de cisive defeat when the time shall come for a general appeal to the nation. He conducted oy giving nis warmest tnanxs to the comrades who had stood by him in a time of adversity amounting to discomfitnre, bating no jot of their confidence in a noble effort oa behalf of a noble and generous people.
