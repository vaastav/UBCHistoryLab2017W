Ooosiderable space is devoted to the fi? nances of the government, while il lake many pages ti repeat eubstint'a'.ly what Mr. Roosevelt has n id on former occa? sions in regard to corporations engaged in interstate commerce. Among other things he sugge-ts that telegraph and telephone companies be made subject t the intersta'.e commerce commishion.

He regards tht visit of the United S ates fleet to the orient as of far-reaching importance, and dwells at length upon tbat incident in the history of the country. Tbe re? mainder of tbe message is consumed in a resume of sundry nna'ters concrroing tbe nation's interests. As a whole, tbe document is aoeee'va'ive in tone.

President R tosevelt waa the pedagog? ue and the subject was deforestation. lu h s annoal message which he laid before Congress he drove home his conservation policy by means of ta'f tone reproduc? tions of pbotogrsphs showing the shock? ing results of timber waite iu northern China and eastern Asia, all taken by a special a .rent of the agricultural der art mevnt. Birren mountains and plains of sand and gravel, which several centuries ago had been among the most fertile spots in the world; regions flooded by ibe destruction of the forests, bottom lands buried by wtste, once broad and Jeep rivets converted Into insignificant waterways, and wLole regions, originally wj-rden sittled and clesred, bat ruined years ago, were depicted in a scries ol ten views with appropriate explana? tory notes by the president.

Instead of being in the bole, the Fidelity Fund? ing Company bas a surplus of $400,000 over its liabilities, and the statement Gilroy nakes to the eflect tbat I am n -ii ing tbe books of the concern, is a all hood. All tbe loans that I ever nate to Catholic institutions or to indi? viduals were upon the best of security." Kier-tn acknowledged tbst tbe company at issued life insurance against the lives of prier sand nm s.and that mortga ges|had been taken on j roperty belonging o Catholic churches, but he added that in no cases bsd the amount leaned ex ceded more than 50 percent, of the ap? praised value of the property on which the loan was made. He denied that heavy bonuses were ever charged for 1 ians made to the company by any woka or financial institutions on co lateral belonging to tbe company.
