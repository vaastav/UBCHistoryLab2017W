ANTIPOLYGAMY Aj BND EENT I It is a long time since an antiMor mon petition was presented in congress but one was yesterday It came from West Virginia and was presented by Representative Dorr of that state The gist of the petition is that the Mormon church is engaged in an active propa ganda and that its missionaries are making a good many converts in West Virginia that the victims of this conversion are mostly families of girls and the petition takes this as prima facie evidence of the nefarious inten tion of the Mormon church to secure political control in the western states that such an institution protected by I the state constitution would be as much of a standing menace to the In I tegrity of the Union as was the slave power of a former generation The I petition closes by asking congress to propose an amendment to the consti tution declaring the practice of poly I gamy a felony punishable by the laws of the United States I It is a pretty safe prediction that so far as congress is concerned nothing will come of it though it will probably I cause some comment in the press and may call forth some remarks from some of the pulpits of the land noth ing more will come of it The old issues that racked this state for near half a century and that more or less disturbed the nation for the time settled should same have been I I there be a revival of them in one form or another they would be state issues not national That the question of church influence in politics will come up occasionally everybody in Utah ex pects but that the church has any gran scheme to control the inter mountain states will receive no cre dence in Utah And if it had any such scheme how would an antipolygamy amendment to the constitution prevent it This West Virginia petition shows that the people of that state who signed it havent advanced nearly so much in the past decade as have the people of this state The nonMormons of Utah are not worrying in the least about polygamy why should the peo ple of West Virginia TRYING TO SERVE TWO MAS TERS The Salt Lake Tribune is about the only paper in the country that pre tends to be a friend of silver which also pretends to believe that the Mc Kinley administration is friendly to sil ver The paper or person that can make such pretensions must be troubled with mental strabismus Fri day the Tribune said We believe the president meant some thing significant when in his message he said the American commission l were not yet ready to report we be lieve if the matter had been consid ered settled that before now Mr Wolcott would have been heard from in the senate More there are outside causes at work In the campaign ol LS96 the statement was repeatedly made that the WilsonGorman tariff would oe ample to raise all needed revenue under normal conditions but that ven I a higher and perhaps better adjusted tariff would not avail until the finan cial basis of the country was broad ened Even the unexpected and nat ural advance in the price of wheat this year has not broken the fore 0 that statement The president must see this so must some at least of his advisers Again the winter is upon I the country and notwithstanding the shouting of good times in certain quar ters the calls for charity will be just as loud and persistent during the next few months as they were during the corresponding months of last year What the president said in his mes sage about the American commission ers not being ready to report was sig nificant and it signified an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of that portion of the people who still give I allegiance to the Republican party and yet retain a belief in silver It prob ably signifies something else to the Tribune and it should give its read ers the benefit of its interpretation especially as it i < = engaged in the task of holding up the hands of the ad ministration in its efforts to do some I I thing for silver Secretary Gage has laid his plan for reforming the currency before the house committee on banking and cur rency and he declares his first great object is to commit the country more thoroughly to the gold standard No one will contend for a moment that this plan is not the presidents Being his what becomes of the belief of the I Tribune that the president meant I something significant when in his mes sage he said the American commis sioners were not ready to report Isnt the Gage bill considerably more sig nificantMhan the phrases of the mes sage And what was the Tribunes I comment on the Gage bill Absolutely nothing though it had this to say of his definition of bimetallism Secretary Gages definition of bimet allism as meaning the gold standard puts us in mind of the old proposal of the white man to the Indian in di viding their hunting spoils which was Ill take the turkey and you take the turkey buzzard or you take he tur key buzzard and Til take the turkey Gages definition is new but the prin ciple is old And whose definition of bimetallism is this It is the definition of the Mc Kinley administration promulgated by its official financial spokesman The McKinley administration sending com missioners abroad to ascertain Euro pean sentiment on the subject of in ternational bimetallism merely that it may say the pledges of the St Louis platform have been fulfilled and hold ing out some false hopes in the presi dents annual message is offering to the silver men and bimetallists of the country nothing but turkey buzzard And still the Tribune is constantly trying to make out that the McKinley administration is yet going to serve out turkey to the bimetallists It should reconcile its editorial page of one day to its editorial page of the next and likewise learn that It can not serve two masters at the same timethe people of the silver produc ing west and the McKinley administra tion I 

PROFESSOR JORDAN PROTESTS I It is really amazing that any member of congress is so small and mean spir ited that he could seriously propose that this great government should enter upon the task of exterminating the fur seals simply because it has thus far been impossible to arrive at any understanding with Great Britain for the prevention of pelagic sealing Yet Representative Johnson of South Dakota has made a proposition look ing to the immediate killing of all seals on the seal islands as the readiest way In which to prevent friction between this country and Canada Against this proposition Professor David Stan Jor i4i = dan nreside of the Stanford univer sity enters a strong protest It is scarcely necessary to point out that this course of action would not accom plish the desired end says he As the animals are never all present at one time on the islands a remnant would be left which in time would revive the herd and with it the whole ques tion In the meantime every objection which has been urged against pelagic sealing would be justly chargeable against such a slaughter It would be necessary to lie in wait for the females and kill them as they came ashore on land to give birth to their young or to provide them with nourishment The young must be slaughtered wantonly or else left to starve The proposition is an abominable one without a single redeeming feature To slaughter the fur seal herd our selves because its preservation is beset with diplomatic difficulties in which the fault has not all been on one side would be a confession n of impotence un worthy of a civilized nation It would transfer to the United States alone and for all time the odium for the de struction of the fur seal herds I There is a manly ring about this lan guage that should make Representa tive Johnson blush when he reads it The course he suggests reminds one of the disputes that the Indians used to have among themselves over the di vision ot captives after a successful raid when being unable to agree among themselves they tomahawked their prisoners The Johnson proposi tion isnt one whit more civilized For congress to authorize such a thing as Representative Johnson recommends would be to authorize the putting of an indelible stain upon the countrys name Professor Jordans protest he being I a recognized authority on the seal I I question cannot fail o have much weight Decency if nothing else would forbid favorable consideration of I Johnsons proposition 

BIMETALLISTS AT THE MKIN LEY SO3 Human nature is t ul and hence it is that children L on people are so easily deceive it is I better to be deceived oo than to be always suspicious o jbody suspicion grows quite as rapidly as jealousy and hence it is not well to I give it undue encouragement But there is a form of suspicion that may be termed nothing more than a com I mon sense caution and which when properly exercised prevents a too fre quent repetition of the same deception It is this trustfulness of human nature that has caused so many bi metallisits to believe that the Mc Kinley administration would do some thing for silver They have hoped and hoped and yet have never seen their hopes realized They have looked upon this Inove and that as the be ginning of the fulfillment of their hopes still every move has proven to be but hope deferred Their expecta tion may be compared to that of Sancho Panza when as governor of Bardtaria he sat down to a feast fit for a king and each time he prepared himself to enjoy the choice viands be I fore him they were instantly removed I They were used to tantalize and deceive I him and at last he was content to go I away asking only a quart of barley for Dapple and some cheese and a loaf of bread for himself Everty time the bimetallists have sat down to the McKinley political board expecting that the fair promises for silver would be realized the McKinley administration has given them a look at them and then removed them as not being good for them And yet some I II I I of them persist in sitting at the board I I when they should know that they will not get even a bit of barley for Dapple and a piece of cheese and a loaf of bread for themselves Isnt it about I time they got up and did a little rustling for themselves It is the only I way they will ever get anything SENATOR RAWLINS AND AN NEXATION The other day the New York Herald placed Senator Rawlins among those who would vote against the Hawaiian annexation treaty According to a Washington dispatch to the San Fran cisco Examiner of the 17th inst the senator was wrongly classified He is reported as saying I favor annexation The islands are capable of selfgovernment I have seen the evils of territorial govern ment I do not want to see the islands governed by a policy similar to that followed by the powers of Europe Now is the accepted time If we miss the golden opportunity today we are I sure to be thrown into a war in the future We need the islands The peo ple of this land are of a colonizing disposition The islands do not lie so far out in the Pacific but they can be reached by this influence We are I stretching out now We must have I them I have no fears on the score of annexation It is best for the islands best for us We believe this is the first public an nouncement of his position on the question of annexation that Senator Rawlins has made Democrats are di vided on the question the party not having made any official declaration on the subject and it is to be regretted that there is no such declaration The senator will not have arrived at any conclusion on the subject without first having given it full and careful con sideration We trust that when the time for considering the treaty by the senate comes he will insist on having it debated in open session GOV ADAMS COMMITTEE RE PORTS The committe appointed by Governor Adams of Colorado to investigate the recent Indian troubles in the vicinity of Lily valley Routt county has filed its report The report is a complete vindication for the game wardens and a correspondingly complete condemna tion of the Indians The report says the Indians were the aggressors that when they learned the game wardens were looking for them they dropped their game and in turn started to look for the wardens that had the game wardens not dropped into the Indians camp before they were aware of their presence the ward ens would have met with disaster at the hands of the Indians and the story of the conflict would have bpen that whites instead of Indians had been killed This may all be still most people will take it with a very generous I amount of salt The presence of I squaws in the camp is sufficient tp re j I ute any testimony to the effect that I the Indians had started to hunt the game wardens J The report may be regarded by the game wardens and their friends as a highly satisfactory vindication but to others it will have very much the ap pearance of a whitewash if for no other reason than that it is so lauda tory The report of the government officers on the reservation will now be awaited vltll much interest That it will differ very materially from that of Governor Adams committee goes without say ing I ngIt It looks as though the day of Prince Bismarcks dissolution were not far off He has been one of the forces of the century When we shall be no more it can be said of him that yesterday he might have stood against the world but it will not be said that there is none so poor as to do him reverence Comptroller Eckels has been telling the people what a great nations weakness is Why does he not supple ment this information by telling what a great mans weakness is It is two years ago Friday since Mr Cleveland sent his famous Venezuelan message to congress That message is the guarantee of his permanent fame In American
