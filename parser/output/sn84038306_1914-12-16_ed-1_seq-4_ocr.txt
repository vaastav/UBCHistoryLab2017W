There were some cheers for quite a number of the things contained in President Wilson's recent message to congress, but the only passages of the message •which elicited generous applause from nearly everyone with in the hearing of his voice were those which announced a policy of opposition to thr maintenance of a large standing army la this country. At sucli a time as this, it is inex pressibly fortunate for Americans that they h.we ft chief executive, who can look above the ruthlessness of present conditions and see an im mutable law, a law of last resort, which enables riglu to finally win supremacy over might. There ip a power at Tork In the universe which makes go ^d tb» "V vine promise that "the mee. shall inherit the earth". This may seem strange to the un thinking person, who imagines that the animal which possesses the greatest capacity to rend and tear has a great advantage in the strug gle for life over all weaker animals In- support of th's higher law take lions and lambs for illustration. Are there not a great many more lambs the world than there are lions' In the primal forests, before man's struggles for existence began, why did not the lions eat up all the lambs? Are there not a thousand lambs alive today for every lion? In the struggle for life are not lambs far in the lead of every animal "red in tooth and claw"? Some may say that the docile ani mals are more numerous because man sides with them. But is it not probable that in the beginning man kind subsisted largely upon animal flesh and slaughtered the least de fenseless first' Be jt^at as it may, nature is at war with every fighter. The animals that are fierce fighters are slow breeders* And the nations that maintain large standing armies $nd engage in destructive wars do so at the expense of their own na tional life. Nations bullded upon' great stand ing armies are illusions, for assur edly they who strive to live by the sword will die by it. History is an unbroken record oE the failure of fighting nations. Ath ens within 70 years reducsd a thou sand cities and countries to sub je tton, but the Athenians found the beginning of their end at Syracuse. •Persia was checked at Marathon and beaten on the sea at Saiamis and her dream of a world empire vanish ed. The Greeks and the Romans sought to establish world empires by force of arms, but nature's immutable law was against them, the same as it was against Napoleon at Water loo. During the years which stand just behind the present time, Russia and Germany and France and Austria built the most ponderous military ma chines in the history of the wor.d. Some of their enthusiasts may have dreamed of achievements similar to those of Cyrup, Xerxes and Alexand er, but if they did their dreams are now changed to funeral hymns for their kind. The Federal government may in crease our navy and help the states to organize their militia forces, but it does not want a big standing army. 

PROGRESS IN FINANCIAL INDE PENDENCE. "Secretary McAdoo's annual report for the Treasury Department deals with a period more trying to the finances of the Nation than any oth er which has arisen in twenty years. It is able to show an emergence from the crisis which promises for the Na tion greater financial stability and strength than has ever been known before. At the outbreak of the great war we were owing Europe some $45, 000,000. This demand debt has al ready been either paid or composed. We have so far absorbed the im mense amount of foreign-owned American securities thrown back here in the panic of approaching war that our Stock Exchanges are pre paring to resume business with few or ino restrictions. We have gone through a heavy gold drain to Europe from these causes and come out with a loss to the Treasury in gold of only f88,6oO, 000, and no loss at all in gold to the country at large. And for the first time in thirty years we have an annual Treasury report which, Instead of crying out alarmingly for banking and currency reform, can dwell upon it as a great fact most satisfactorily accomplish ed. I '-:.||-frf "The road at last lies clear and firm before business,'' and these are some ot the particular reasons why It can be entered upon ywith an abounding confidence.'' iSS TArr ADVANCM SOUND 9U0GE8 TIONS. Assumption by oongresa of author ity to prevent states from violating, by laws or by lawless violence, Unit ed Stateg treaties would do more to prevent the possibility of war be tween this nation and another than increasing the army and navy, for mer President William Howard Taft declared in an address recently. "The only real possibility of a war that I can foresee is the wanton, reckless, wicked willingness on the part of a narrow section of the coun try to gratify racial prejudice and clasp hatred by flagrant breach of treaty rights in the form of state law, or by lawless violence," he said. ''Congress should at once assume authority for the national govern ment to see to it that it cannot be dragged into international difficulties through such blind selfishness, and this Step would be quite as effective as improving our military defenses. Indeed, I think it would be more ef fective to prevent the possibility of war." Congress Should Curb State/a. Congress should delegate power to the national government, to the president and Federal courts. Mr. Taft did not name any state in this connection. While deprecating the ''mild hys teria'' regarding the country's de fenses, Mr. Taft admitted that parts of the army and navy should be strengthened. He would increase the army from 25 to 50 per cent insure the navy enough men to man the re serve vessels, and provide new artil lery, chiefly for coast defenses. No Need for Excitement. "There is no necessity for great excitement," he said. "What should be done can be done in a short time and with no excessive expenditure. "It is said that our coast defenses have no artillery with a range long enough to resist the attacks of some of the naval artillery that could be brought against them. '•This is true, .but I venture to think that an attack upon our coast fortifications out of range of the guns we have in them would not be likely to result either in their destruction or surrender, but that is no reason why with the development of guns of longer range we cannot have enough of them (not man-needed) and have them within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. Need a Few New Guns. "Our coast defenses are otherwise quite complete for the resistance to naval attack, and with congressional provision for the new guns in one appropriation bill can make a suc cessful naval attack upon them en Urely out of the question." The present wa-, Mr Taft remark ed, showed that the day hasjiflit'ar rived when the possibility^of war can be removed by treaty or arbitra -tleti.'"" 

WHAT IS PREPAREDNESS? What possible oujeciion can .Rep resentative uaraner have to the Pres ident's counter-proposal for an inves tigation by the regular committees ot Congress of the country's prepar edness for a defensive war? Much of the credit for any investigation would belong to Mr. Gardner. The President has formally stated that ''there were no facts in the pos session of the executive departments which were not at the disposal of those committees." What more does the Representative from Massachu setts want-' Whatever is done must be done toy Congress. Whatever mon ey is appropriated must be appropri ated by Congress. The final decision as to men and ships and money rests with Congress, and the committees of Congress provide the natural agen cy for investigation. The World trusts that there will be a very thorough inquiry by the House and Senate. Whether the Unite States is prepared to resist the attack of any country that is likely to attack us ought to be known publicly. Whether the Amer ican people have been getting value received for the immense sums ex pended on their military establish ment is a matter that ought to be known too. As for the lessons of the present war, the United States should be ready to 'take the fullest advantage of them. It cainnot be said that Congress has starved the army and navy. The navy appropriations for 1914 were the larg est In the history of the country. The army appropriations exceeded those of the two previous years. In the estimates submitted to Con gress yesterday for 1915 the appro priations for military purposes ex ceeded $256,000,000, which is no mean gum. For many years more than two-thirds of the ordinary revenues ol the United States Government have been expended on war, either past or future. This Democratic Congress has dealt more generously with the mili tary establishment than any Repub lican Congress, yet the demand for new armament and greater appro priations was never .before so insis tent. Part of this clamor is mis chievous and unscrupulous partisan ship. Part of it is sheer jingoism. Part of it is sordid amd selfish. But back of it all is a genuine and1 prop er anxiety on the part of the Amer ican people to know whether the United States is reasonably well protected. The startling rapidity with which the greatest war in human history was brought to an issue by Austria and Germany, the invasion of Bel guim and the sudden disintegration of international law have disturbed the whole country. People want to know whether if we were attacked with as little notice as France and Belguim received we should be in a position to protect ourselves, and the best way to relieve these anxie ties Is through a serious, dispassion ate, honest investigation ot our military establishment by Coiigres.— New Tork World. wmm- 

THINKING DESTRUCTIVELY BILLjONS. (phicago Tribune.) Not many months ago the finance ministers of Europe were, as they admitted, at their wits' end trying to find new sources of revenue for con structive and retormatory purposes. When the British medical profession struck against the social insurance act, because the compensation offer ed the doctors for their services thereunder was deemed to low, Lloyd-George earnestly protested that he could not possibly raise another million or so to pay the doctors more. In Germany complaints were heard 'that the industrial insurance and compensation laws were costing the empire too much money, and that Industry couldn't stand the growing burden. In France proposed and promised reforms were postponed be cause the taxing authorities positive ly didn't know what else to assess. Think now of these things in the light of the war loans and war cred its voted by the parliaments of Europe. The German reichstag, with but one negative vote, has sanction ed new war loans to the amount of $1,250,000,000, and this money will be needed in the spring, if not earlier. The British parliament voted a like sum the other day The counntries at war, with' the ex ception of the little fellows who are being financed by big brothers, are all emphatically "thinking imperial ly,'' thinking not in milllioms but in billions, and thinking of these for destructive purposes only. "The Lon don Statist/ in a stoical if not cheerful editoral, tells the British that the war is costing them a bil lion and a half per annum, and that they will have to pay indefinitely in terest on a new war debt of about $5,000,000,000. It thinks, however, that the money can be raised with out much difficult on fairly moderate terms—say 6 per cent. Well, perhaps it can. But these staggering totals are not likely to be dropped from the sky. Hoarders may jecome investors to a certain ex tent, but the greater part of the money must 'be diverted from indus try, enterprise, commerce, and con structive social reform. The wealth and capital burn© wasted, destroy ed, cannot be used in further pro duction, in extensions and improve ments. The loss is irreparable. The loss is a world loss. Every nation, is suffering and will continue to suffer from it. And the infinite pity, the tragedy, the bitterness of it is that the tremendous and almost inconceiv able losses in life, health, vigor, and treasure are entailed not toy a war for principles, for human rights, for progress, for essential interests, but by a war which even Dr. Dernburg, the able eponent of the German view, describes as "unnecessary, stu pid, and uncalled for7." Must such a war really go on for years? Is there no chance for the still small voice of sanity and common sense in Europe? Your Parents' Diplomas.

Fbr many months our people have read of Antwerp, Namur, Liege, Dixmude, Veraun, Lodz, Belgrade, Przemysl, Cracow and other European towns until them seem like locations in our own county. Who knows where Bridgeport, Ohio is located? Or Blue Rock, or Glotts ler, or unauncey, or New btraitsvillt, or Joe town, or Lathrop, or the tous and other towns, villages and mere ram-shacKle settlements in the great bituminous coal fieid generally known by the regional title "Hocking Val ley?'' Who cares? Who knows how they live, what they eat what they wear what books they read what schools they attend what social conditions sur round them and who on earthi cares? Wholesale liquor dealers at Mariet ta, Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, Louisville, Toledo and Youngstown care aind keep track of pay days— when the men are working. But just now Bridgeport sends out word that twenty thousand children of the region are destitute that Christmas is not for them .the strike of several months, with only forty nine dollars relief to each man for the entire time has brought them to the verge of pinching want. Amd the cause of the quarrel? The men want forty-nine cents the ton "run of the mine", the operators will concede only forty-seven cents. It all means about twelve to eighteen cents on your average yearly coal bill and the railroads and operators swipe as many dollars. To state the brutal truth, the op erators seek to keep, their mein in at least financial clavery, and seek to prevent proper educational and en lightening social influences for their families, because the operators know that they must go on recruiting from this self-same class, that enlightened and independent men will not bear their continuous abuse and that am bitious women who have pride for self, for husband amd their young will not abide the conditions that sur round a bituminous coal camp in the state of Ohio, U. S. A. In the winter the men work at in sufficient pay. In the summer they work enough to pay the rent,—and the operators own the shacks in which they abide—and live, to put it in the idiom of the valley, "on the groundhogs they can catch, on the potatoes and mutton they can lift." No relief has been suggested for them at any time. No Red Cross reg iment invades their localities. No Christmas ship—or Christmas box car—unloads for them. And, as was said before—who cares?

During the first half of the seven teenth century Cardinal Richelieu, the founder of the French Academy, be came offended by the rude manner in which pointed knives were used and thereafter caused his knives to be rounded.

Since the sev enteenth century the form of table knife has remained substantially as nre know it. Vi'V--•'- Oitind1!

The honor able capitulation followed one of the most heroic defenses in the history of warfare. On the death of Charles II. of Spain the French seized Ostend, but in 1700, after Marlborough defeated the French at Ramlllles, it was taken by the allies. In 1740 it was retaken by the French, but restored three years later. In 1756 the French garri soned the town for the Empress Maria Theresa. In 1792 Ostend again fell to the French, who evacuated it In 1703. regained it in 1794 and defeated the English there in 1798. The city was under the flag of Netherlands from 1814 to 1830, when Belgium regained its independence.

She weal in and bought a small library of books. It was brought home and added to our family collection. My wife took the books one by one and dusted them all. giving each a cursory examination. Be tween the leaves of one of them was letter, sealed and stamped, addressed to James Overaker, In a neighboring city, which had not been mailed. I was appealed to for sn opinion at to what should be done with it I ad vised Uat It be taken to the hous6 from which It had coma This was done, but the place was deserted. I then advised sending It on its way through the mall, but since it might be lost I wrote our address on the upper left hand corner. In a week it was returned- My wife then insisted on making a dead letter office of our selves, opening the letter, learning the address of the sender and returning it to her. I say her, for the address had been written in a feminine hand. Before I could stop my wife she had opened and read the letter. "The brute!" she exclaimed, handing the letter to me. The writer was evidently a young girl who had bad a spat with her lover and either had sent him off or he had left her of his own accord. She wrote that she was heartbroken over their separation and had decided to ask blm to come back to her and "make It up." though Sue—whoever that might be—had said she would be a fool to do so. "It looks to roe," I said, "that this 8ue Is the mischief maker in this case. I wonder If she didn't cause the trou ble In the first place." "What makes you think that?" asked my wife. "My most cogent reason is your find Ing the letter In the book. Evidently the writer was bent on posting it. but was unable to withstand Sue's influ ence It was laid away for considers tion as to whether it should be mailed or not—and never mailed. "I am going to send it back to the poor girl and advise her to send it No man could resist such an appeal." "Send It to her without the advice." The letter was Inclosed In an envel ope addressed to the location given, which was the house where the books had been bought with a statement of its finding. I Inferred that the post mnster had been advised of the new address and would deliver the letter ac cordingly. I was right In due time a letter came from the writer of the one returned, thanking me for sending it Her name was Winifred, and this time she signed her full name, Winifred Marbury. She said that she bad sup posed the letter bad been posted. Her cousin, Susan Fountain, bad agreed to post it for her, but had delayed doing so. thinking she (Winifred) might re gret having sent it and the letter had been forgotten. 1 smiled cynically. "Do you doubt the poor girl's story asked my wife. *'I do' not'doubt that she Is more con tiding than bright This Sue. instenefcof posting the letter, hid it in the book. Her explanation Is a falsehood." "I wonder If that Is so? I'll write back and tell this Winifred Mnrbury that she has been duped." "She'll not believe you. If you wish to do some altruistic work find the man and tell him to find the woman." "What woman?" "Sue." "Explain." "Tell blm to get bis girl from nnder Sue's influence. No it's no business of yours. Send him the correspondence If he Is too stupid to perceive where the trouble lies he is no loss to any girl." This got me into trouble. My wife started me on a bunt for the lover. I Anally secured his address, and my wife mailed him the correspondence. Including a copy of the original letter The very next day the gentleman call ed on my wife when 1 was at bus! ness to thank her for having interest ed herself in the matter. He told her that be had been wavering between the two cousins, though be really wished Winifred. He was convinced that Sue bad acted dishonorably In the matter, and he was sure be could con vince Winifred of the truth. Doubtless if he bad seen me instead of my sympathetic wife he would have confined himself to thanks. "You men," she, said to me. "are brutally unsympathetic. If it had not been for me these lovers would have never been reunited." "It it bad not been for my discre tion," I replied, "they would have been farther apart than ever. Sue would have got the fellow, and you would have been hopelessly mixed up In it" "Not at all. If I bad had my way tne matter would have been tettied long ago." I am not in the habit of holding a prolonged argument with my wife, for I consider myself Incapable of breaa Ing down her logic. 1 therefore made no reply to her last statement When cards came to the wedding she said to me: "That couple whom 1 reunited are going to be married. We're Invited to the wedding." "Indeed," 1 replied. -When dow It come off?" "Next week." Round of Pleasure.
