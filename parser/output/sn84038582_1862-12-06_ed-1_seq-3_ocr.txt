'," We publish President . Lincoln's An nual Message as a matter of coarse. The document has not siren the country a tunning surprise, not even created a sen sation for any thing important or unexpec ted it contains. The democratic press generally pronounce it week and wisby- wasby, while the republican papers damn it with faint praise. In short, there is very little in it Our foreign affairs are repre sented as in a satisfactory condition ; colo nization is admitted thus far to hare prov ed failure for want of a tropical country willing to receive the negroes; the public lands hare ceased to be a source of reve nue ; the post office revenue is gratifyingly increased ; and the national debt is swelled to some $800,000,000. This is substantially the Preiident'a report on the condition of the country. The balance of the Message is devoted to a recommendation that the present circulation of the banks be sup pressed, and that a new circulation be fnrnished them by the government, based on government stocks substantially the Illinois stuniptail system ; and to a long and labored defence of the President's pet scheme of "compensated emancipation." It is possible, on a small scale, in a few of the border states, this scheme might be made to work after its constitutionality should be made clear by the adoption of the President's proposed amendments; but as a comprehensive scheme to cover the whole south and the whole of her four millions of slaves, the plan is simply absurd will net bear discussion. The people will never consent to be taxed to pay for 4,000,- 000 of slaves, when, after all the money is paid and the slaves made free, neither they or the south will be bettered by the operation. The omissions of the message are more significant and important thaa its con tents. Particularly significant is its entire failure to even allude, except incidentally, to the emancipation proclamation. This gives the radicals great chagrin, and causes them to treat the message, if not with loud -mouthed condemnation, with what about equal, ominous silence nearly amounting to contempt. t oraase Leland, sa.

Grant's army got in motion last week, and reaching the rebel fortifications on the Tallahatchie, took them after a short fight, the rebels scattering southward. By Monday the bulk of Orant's army was across the river, and moving towards Ab bey vilie, where it was expected they would make a stand; butoa eur advance coming in sight, it was found the rebels Lad re moved and burnt all their stores and re treated further south.' Grant is still pur suing them. A rumor comes up the Mississippi that the second expedition from Helena, under Gen. Hovey, went eastward, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroad near Grenada. -cutting off the retreat of the army now fleeing before Grant Rosecrans has put his army in motion trem Nashville, and as the rebels are aid to be 65,000 strong at Murfreesboro, and well fortified, a' battle is daily expected there. . Gen. McClernand.s expedition is ready to move, and all that detains it is said to be trouble at Washington as to the com mander, Halleck wishing that some West Point man shall be over McClernand. Grant's army, as well as Gen Sherman's, which is also moving son th ward by land from Memphis, are evidently but flanking forces in tidof the main expedition under McClernand. While this expedition is ready at Columbus, it is also certain that a large fleet ia ready at New Orleans' to move up from below and co-operate with it Gen.

The rumor comes in so many shapes, and its truth has been affirmed with such positivenest, both' by Feraando Wood aad the Chicago Timet, that there can be no doubt left of the fact, that the rebel au thorities at Richmond have sent to Wash ington overtures Tor peace. What the precise terms are which they propose, however, bas not transpired, tut the Timet says " they are such an the south could honorably make and the north honorably accept."

TrcxWHEAJ rUiVK, a nic artlela, for sal at gnst last. Halleek visited McCleilan, and finding that the latter asked for 50.CKX) more men to - take Richmond, told him 120,0011 were the urmestthat could be sent, and ordered him to prepare to evacuate. McCleilan took a night to consider on it, and next morning agreed to make the attempt with 20,000 re-inforcemcnts. Halleck thereupon returned to Washing ton, but on arriving there found a despatch from McCleilan saying the enemy had been re inforced, aad instead of 20,000, be must have 35,0OU mere men. Halleck, in reply ordered him to evacuate the position. Against this order McCleilan enters a warm protest, couched in language breathing such a longing, earnest, everwhelming con cern for the success ef the great cause in which he was engaged, that, whatever may be said of him otherwise, that letter must forever satisfy the country of the purity of his motives aad of the unselfish intensity of his patriotism. Halleck, however, was inexorable, and McCleilan ia ordered to move. And here comes in the nub of the report McCleilan, says Hal leck, spent a week in getting ready to move, and nearly another week in reach ing Aquia Creek, while he knew that tbe whole rebel army was marching upon Washington, and there was the most urgent need of every man to reinforce Pope, lie goes further, and says that, even after McCleilan s army reached Alex andria, if tbe various divisions had prompt ly marched out to tbe assistance of Pope, the rebel army could easily have been de stroyed, while the failure to do so, caused all the subsequent disasters. As McClei lan had been substantially removed from the command of tbe army by thia time, the blame for this tardiness to reinforce Pope ia not indeed imputed to the former, but rather to his division commanders. So far from accusing Pope of mismanage ment, Halleck commends bis dispositions, and attributes his failure toothers. Among others, he gives a letter from Pope pro nouncing Sgel decidedly unreliable. He also finds fault with tbe long delay of tbe araay ost tbe Upper Potomac after the battle of Antietam, and impliedly places upon McCleilan r the blame Tor the Harper a Ferry disaster. . , , The report will be read with deep in terest, as giving a full and autheuticaketch of all tbe operations of our armies for the last six or eight months; but as its mam object seems to bare been to Justify the removal of McCleilan,- it ' will doubtless have tbe effect to draw out a counter statement from that officer, and may thus lead to endless and useless if not injurious bickerings and controversy.

The President bas ! so far yielded to the popular will as ex pressed at the late elections, as to order the release of all persons arrested in the loyal States, for discouraging enlistments, ifc. ; and of persons arrested ia the border States for being unfriendly to the govern ment. No formal investigation of charges against such persons is to be made, but they are simply ordered to be "honorably discharged." An intimation is also given, that hereafter persons in the loyal States accused of offences against the U. 3. are to be tried in the regular way by tbe Courts.
