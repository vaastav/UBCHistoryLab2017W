The JUgis and Intelligencer ~FREDERICK W. BAKER, EdTtor7~ .Kfl is has a more extended circulation among tho Intelligent farmers and business men of Harford than any other paper in tho county, tho attention of advertisers is directed to this fact. IJ K L, AIR, MA Friday Morning, • - - December 10,1886. The President's Message. Tho message of President Cleveland, which was read to Congress on Monday, is a lung document but it is replete with patriotism aud good sense. It discusses our relations with foreign countries, with all of which we are at peace; deprecates the cruel treatment of inof fensive Chinese, in the Western States and Territories, and calls attention to the Culling incident in Mexico. THE 

NATIONAL FINANCES. The most interesting aud important part of the message is that which treats of our na tional finances. The showing for the first complete year of u Democratic administration is one of which every man who voted for a change may be proud. The increase on re ceipts from customs aud revenue for ihe last year was $15,841,295.04, This increased revenue cost $640,55299 less to collect than such revenue cost in the preceding year. EXPENSES OF THE GOVERNMENT. The expenses of the government, too, were $17,788,707 loss than last year, leaving a sur plus in the treasury of $93,956,588.56. as against a surplus of $63,463,771.27 at the close of Ihe previous year. Decreased expenses are noted iu every branch of government expenditures except in the pension list. Surely this is a good showing and justifies all that it was claimed would follow if Cleveland were elected. OUR FOREIGN EXPORTS, the message shows, have decreased, particu larly of breadstuffa and provisions. The rea son for this decrease may be attributed as much to our uujusl tariff laws, which drive from our shores the trade of other nations, as to the increased production of food by other countries. These facts afford a reason for the low prices of our farm products. UNNECESSARY TAXATION. The President calls the especial attention of Congress to the fact that our revenues ex ceed our needs and suggests that action be taken to relieve the people from unnecessary taxation. Ho pronounces the accumulation of money in the treasury demoralizing and adds; “When more of the people’s substance is ex acted through the form of taxation than is ne cessary to meet the Just obligations of the gov ernment aud the expense of its economical ad ministration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government.” The message points out the insidious char acter of taxation through the tariff on im ports and asserts that the price added by the tariff to the cost of living is paid by the peo ple as absolutely as if collected by tax-gather ers. Tho laboring man, he says, “is thoughtful ly inquiring whether in these circumstances aud considering the tribute he constantly pays into tho public treasury as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share of advantages,” Mr. Cleveland asserts the fact that the aver age rale of federal taxation upon imports is to-day, in time of peace, hut little less and on some articles more than was imposed during the war when the government needed mil lions to support its armies. 

READJUSTMENT OF THE TARIFF. Iu readjusting the burdens of taxation, however, Sir. Cleveland is far from advocat ing any policy that would suddenly break up large aud important industries which have been built up under the present tariff, but he thinks if the public good requires it they should bo content with fair and cautious con sideration of their interests while the demand of the people for relief is honestly answered. The interests ot American labor should also, ho says, be considered iu the revision of the tariff, not only because labor is the capi tal of our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of government favor, “but for the fur ther and not less important reason, that the laboring mau, surrounded by his family in his humble home, as a consumer is vitally inter ested in all that cheapens Hie cost of living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comlorts and advantages.” A 

WORD FOR THE FARMERS. President Cleveland appreciates tho hard ships of the farmer, iu connection with this tariff question. He says : “But our farmers and agriculturists—those who from the soil produce the things consumed by all—are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned than any otber of our citizens in a just and careful system of federal taxation. Those actually engaged in aud more remotely connected with tbis kind of work number near ly one-half of our population. None labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toll aud no interposition of the government enhances to any great extent tho value of their products. Aud yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables tbem to bring into tbeir homes, and for l Heir implements of husbandry, they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit which, by the action of the government, is given to tbo more favored manufacturer.” He recommends every possible encourage ment by the government to experiments look ing to the homo production, at a low cost, of articles of food now imported from abroad. Mr. Cleveland also says: “The interests of millions of our citizens en gaged in agriculture arc involved In an enlarge ment and improvement of the results of their labor; and a zealous regard for their welfare should be a willing tribute to those whose pro ductive returns are a main source of our prog ress and power.” He also hopes that the subject of pleuro pneumonia among cattle, affecting, as it docs oar food supply, will seriously engage the at tention of Congress. , THE 

SILVER PROBLEM. President Cleveland renews his recommen dation to cease the compulsory coinage of silver, which has accumulated in the treasury vaults to an extent not needed for use as a circulating medium. The message calls renewed attention to the defenceless condition of our seaeost and lake frontier and urges that effective steps he tikeu for their protection. The President devotes considerable space to matters pertaining to our public lands and national forests, and suggests amendments to the homestead laws in the interests of actual settlers. The inequalities in the pension list are also adverted to. “The men who fought side by side,” says the President, “should stand side by side when they participate in a grateful na tions kind remembrance. He renews his recommendation for the ap pointment of arbitrators to settle controver sies between employers and employes He bolds fast to l>i< civil service reform views. The subject, lie thinks, is misuudui stood, but he asks Congress to give il a c >eer ful and ungrudging sii; p nt. The remaining t ipies treated of are the Freidmcn's Hank and t le District of Colom bia. Reassembling of Congress. The second session of tbe 49th Congress began in Washington at noon, on Monday. The Senate was called to order by Us Prod dent. Hon. John Shciman, and the House by the Speaker, Hon. John G. Carlisle. Very little business was transacted except the read ing of tiie President’s message. It was list ened to with attention and thesplendid sh liv ing of economy and good business man ig. - ment under Democratic administration was a matter of congratulation among Damourat io mombors. The President's strong stand In favor of a revision of the t ir ; ff unde a deep impression. Secretary Manning's Report. The report of the Secretary of tlie Treasu ry is an able and interesting document, ami af ords a clear insight into the financial opera tions of the government. Mr. Manning op poses the compulsory coinage of silver and gives forcible reasons why the government revenues should be reduced. He says the an nual surplus in the Treasury in the last seven years has been $125,000,000, of which 

SIOO,- 000,000 a year has gone to pay the public debt and the remainder mostly to buy silver for coinage. Silver dollars to the number of 250,000 are stored in the treasury vaults. By the first of next October all of the public debt that can be paid will have been liquidat ed. Then if the purchase of silver is stop ped and there is no relorm in taxation, $125,- 000,000 will be annually poured into the treasury, which had better be in the pockets of the people. The Secretary does not regard it wise to abolish the taxes on whisky, tobacco and beer, because if the tariff is taken off raw materials our imports will fall very low. He adds; “Whenever we take off the shackles of war tariff taxes on raw materials, such Increased prosperity will follow for employers, and such larger and steadier employment for wage-earn ers, by increasing the sales abroad of our own manufactures, and by whipping our foreign competitors in our own markets, that we shall see our income from imported manufactures dwindle to small proportions.” lie gives the protectionist theory a hard knock. He asserts that American labor is not high because of protection, but because of its efficiency Of our domestic exports last year, amounting to $060,000,000, but 16 per cent, were manufactured products. This, he thinks, does not indicate progress. lie charges protection with our backwardness in commerce, and says the same iniquitous sys tem helps a few thousand employers and has trodden down millions of wage-earners. Ten millions of people are taxed by the tariff that oue million others may reap a profit. The Secretary thinks the boon ofuutaxed clothing should beconferrcd upon the toilers of tie land, and suggests the immediate passage of an act placing raw wool on the free list. “The common daily clothing of the American people need not he taxed,” says the Secreta ry j “therefore it ought not to bo taxed.” — —lt is reported that Mr. A. K. Treadway is to be run ns a candidate for Mayor of Havre dc Grace, by the Knights of Labor. Mr. Treadway is a member of the city coun cil aud belongs to the order. He is per sonally quite popular. Several other promi nent gentlemen, Democrats and Republicans; have also been spoken of in connection with lire office. In the municipal contests in Havre do Grace, heretofore, polities have been ignored, the contest being mainly for good government, irrespective of parly or class considerations. —The recent snow-storm extended over a very wide area. The storm was experienced iu the middle sections of Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, through the Mississippi Val ley, northeastward, and through all the At lantic coast Slates, north of Florida.
