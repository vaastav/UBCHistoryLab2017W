An effort was mado at tho last session of f'ongrc. s to grant a mail subsidy in aid of the new line of steamers now plying be tween San Francisco, New Zealand and Australia, but without success, though im portant aid had been rendered by similar subsidies granted by tho two British colo nies thus connected by stc.im. rs with tho great commercial metropolis of America on tlie Pacific. The chief objection urged against granting this mail subsidy ot the lime tho bill was before Congress, was that the lino was an individual enterprise, and 0* course entirely dependent upon tho •kill, capital and energy of ono man, Whereas a company, properly chartered a id organized, would be permanent in its nature, aud more likely to meet the grow ing demands of commerce in that quarter of the Republic. This objection' has now been overcome, ths property and business of the line hav ing passed into the hands of a corporation organized in New York Stato, called the United States, New Zealand and Australia Steamship Company, of which Mr. Webb ia president, the directors including the Mayor of San Francisco, president and cashier of the Bank of California, and Iho president of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. All the steamers iiud mail con tracts of the Webb line havo passed into tho hands of this company. The many important advantages accru ing to our government from the establish ment of this line of Pacific steamers, will strongly commend it to the benefit of this Subsidy, when tho matter is again pressed upon tho uttentiou of Congress. It is upon the Pacific that we most easily make head way in the rebuilding of our tuarilime in terests as against the commercial advan tages of England, and the fact that both the New Zealand nnd Australian colonies have e_lundt.d aid lo this lino in individual hands, will strongly impress the American miud iv favor of the subsidy asked. Tho question is of vastly more importance to us now, since tho Pacific railroitd, in connection wilh this line ol steamers, gives its au immense advantage over any European government iv reaching tho commerce of those distant regions. Tho success of the Pacific mail steamship line to Japan has demonstrated the advantages we possess for maintaining our ascen dency of the ocean trado of the Pacific. Before that lino was estab lished England held a complete supre macy in the commerco of Japan, by her promptitude in having her steamers on thoso seas. But our line has completely reversed the situation, so that American commerce with Japan now exceeds that of all other nations. Since the line to Aus tralia and New Zealand was established our trade with thoso countries has largely increased. What is now needed is that the permanence and regular running of the liuo should be assured by a mail subsidy. .So the friend, of this great enterprise assert, and there seems to bo great plausi bility in their argument. The policy of the government has been .gainst the granting of subsidies to Atlantio steamship lines, but our ascendency in the Pacific is geuerally accepted as a matter of tbe first importance by our statesmen and public writers, and it is for th a r.ason, and the fact that this newly organized company is now competing with one of the greatest of all the British steamship iut .rests—the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company—that tlie subsidy will bo more favorably considered by Congress. Before the establishment of this line, and that from San Francisco to Japan, Great Britain completely monopo lized the commerce of China, Japan, tho East India islands, and the Indian petiin snla. The Whig complains of tho unexpected turn that affairs have taken in Now Or leans, iv regard to the political muddle which disgraces Louisiana, as similar ones do Alabama and Arkansas. We presume our neighbor has no sympathy with the Warmoth faction in that Stßte, nor with the high-handed proceedings by which they have sought to retain their power. As we look upon the controversy, Warmoth's audacious usurpations are only paralleled by tho weakness of a people, once full of spirit and energy, who could tamely sub mit to them as the Louisianians have. His List despotic a.t seems to have capped the climax, and tha best people of all paitijs in tlie State seem to have united in the summary steps that were taken for his ex pulsion from the position he had notorious ly usurped. As the matter stands, Warmoth has been defeated by the court in his effort to control tho Legislature, and tho decision of tho court is sustained by General Emory and the business interests rf the city, as well as tho cool judgment of the State. The result is that the elcctiou will be prop erly declared, and tho rightful legislature seated. If the people cf New Orleans would manifest n loyal and proper spirit, and consult their own interests by main tabling the laws ruthcr tl.nn jeapordizing them by jumping at every chanco to in crea-o trouble, this Warraolh imbroglio would never havo originated. The nusstio- of the valid!., ef his acts wag brought before tbo Cir cuit Court of tho United State.. Wo tlo not assume to docidc on the tech nical regularity of Judgo Durell _ proceed ings. If he has transcended his powers, tne judicial system opens tho way for a correction cf the error. The Court has simply ovoruled the high-handed measures of Warmoth on a case properly presented to its consideration, and tho part which General Emory has had to perform, in en forcing tho decrees of a federal court, has been an extremely difficult and delicate one. Ilia course seems to have been marked by great temperance and judgment, and no serious disturbance of tho peace has been provoked. It is difficult to exaggerate the evil. which this man Warmoth, whose career is pow near its close, has brought on tho un fortunate State he has so long ruled. Loui siana, under him, has not only been plun dered, but it has been oppressed. Lite and property have been rendered insecure in many parts of tho Stato, and particularly so in tho capital, whero his infltienco has been most felt. The fact that the Electoral College of Louisiana failed to cast its vote for Presi dent and Vico-I'resident on Wednesday last, is urged as an additional reason for tho abolition of tho Eloctoral College sys tem. One State is thus left practically without a voico in the Presidential election, as the voto of the Electoral College would be a nullity, if cast on any other day. The consequencos would have been of tho most serious character if the result of the elec tion had depended upon tho vote of that particular State. It seems that there is no law providing for tho removal of a President in the event of his becoming in sane, and in case of insanity in a President the country would bo in the samo condition as England in the time of Oeorge 111. It is suggested that some remedies should be provided for these defects in our political system, and that there should be some law ful means found for testing the validity of a Presidential election. At present the only remedy against fraud is a recourse to arms. The Tribune thinks it is unfortunate that some of the sensitive and high-spirited Boston newspapers protested against their sufferers by the flre being tho recipients of outside aid. The protest chilled somewhat the generous impulses of tho whole coun try ; none felt like offering relief which might bo considerod obtrusive. But now the Central Committee of Relief are obliged to say that they need $100,000 for imme diate necesgitieß. To be sure, no appeal is made to other cities, but tho committee pointedly intimate that such a course may yet bo necessary, unless the people of Bos ton respond liberally. It would have hurt tho dignity of Boston Bomowhat to re ceive the proffered gifts ; but it would have dono much good to those who wanted to dispense their generosity. The now Jefferson school, at Washing ton, was dedicated on (Saturday. B. O. Korthrop, Esq., Secretary ot the Connecti cut Board of Education, delivered the principal address, strongly condemning the fashion of sending American boys to for eign schools. Prof. Tyndall followed and approved Mr. Northrop's warning against this practice. Mr. Mori, Japanese Minis ter, also made an address, and said the now educational system of Japan embraces eight colleges, 256 high schools and over 53,000 public schools, with compulsory at tendance of all children over six years. Ja >an is doing better than many of the American States. IT is said that a bill will soon be offered in 'he House of Representatives for a re mission of duties ou goods imported by Boston merchants and destroyed in the great fire. Tho bill will be similar to tho one passed in 1838 for the relief of mer chants who suffered in the New Tork flre of 1535. Its principal feature is tho i__u ing of certificates to tho morchants who lost goods for tho amount of duties paid, which are to bo recorved by the Govern ment as payment for duties on goods to bo imported in tho future. The arguments in the case of the great New Jorsey railroad suit were commenced last Thursday, and are likely to occupy the whole of this week. Thus far Chancellor Williamson, for the complainants, and At torney General Gilchrist, for the defend ants, are the only counsel who have been heard. Other lawyers of eminence are to follow in the argument, and the case will hardly be submitted beforo Friday or Sat urday. Senator Ferry, of Connecticut, has introduced a bill in Congross to repeal the iron-clad oath, but it does not remove that oath from the Public Land laws. It is now required in preemption and homestead entries, nnd serves but poorly any just pur pose, and protects no interest of the gov ernment. It is simply an indirect pun ishment for persons who have been relieved of every other disability. Mr. Beck, of Kentucky, it is understood, is preparing a bill which will strike this oath from the Land laws. Senator Sumner is said to be ongaged in preparing a speech in support of his res olution proposing to erase the names of the battles of tho civil war from the Army Register and regimental flags, so as to ob literate mtmories of the past conflicts bo t.veen the North and tho South. lie says t i.-ii all history shows that no country has anything to gain by perpetuating tho recol lections of its civil strifes or the memorios of conflicts between its own citizens. The Indians aro allowed free rides on all the freight trains near their homes on tho Central Paciflo road, tho privilege being granted to secure their good will. They consider themselves to be the only persons entitled to " dead head" rides, and keep a sharp look out for white men who try to evade payment of fare. The Stato Department has not matured any proposition looking to the distribution of the Geneva award among the individual claimants, beyond tbe suggestions of the President's Message. It is probable that j (Senator Morton's bill, with some revision, I will mtM (lit rs.ufr--ieot« of tbe cm».
