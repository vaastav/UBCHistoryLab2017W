^idunaitd gispta. .?:?*u? . . . ? TUESDAY. DECEMBER a, 1878. The Presidents Message. ; As In duty bound, we present to onr readers this morning the President's mes sage in full. WC are gratlflwi to be able to announce that the Pitssldent has not lost his bead, but is the aame advocate of peace ful measures that he has almost always proved hJrosoH to be. Ho eoKnscli no ex treme measures. Ho is still 'moro or less afflicted with necrophobia, but he is not yet a stalwart" by any means. We may de? - scribe tbe message by saying that we are (jflife as well pleased with what it omits to say as with what it docs say. The President begins with an acknow ledgement of the reasons which we have for thankfulness to Providence?full crop?, good health, &c., but in this connection re fers to tbe yellow-fever epidemic. He tclJs us that Congress passed a national quaran tine act last year, and recommends that it be extended so as to take charge of matters which the States cannot well regulate. Tbe President says the recent congres sional elections afforded a practical test of the freedom of tbe negroes to exercise the right of suffrage. He declares that the new amendments gave the South "a large in crease of power"; but in this be is mis taken. The large increase was about twelve members of the House of Representatives, and -none in the Senate. It is entertaining to hear a fanatic on the negro question talk ing as if the enfranchisement of the negroes bad been a benefit to tbe whites of the South and an injury to the negroes. Why, Mr. President, your party forced this ad ditional power upon us. You crammed emancipation down our throats by the sword, and pinned ncgro-snflVage to our Slate constitutions with the bayonet. It was the freeing of tbe negroes? your own act? that gave to us this additional pow er about which our *< northern brethren" arc so fond of prating. We did not ask for it. We did not thank you for it. We shall never be grateful for it. Tbe southern whites were always represented in Congress. In the North the negroes as well as the whites were always represent ed?even before the war; and now because our negroes have been put upon an equality with yours, you keep reminding us of tbe fact. There is nothing more despicable than the spirit which is at the bottom of these reminders; and nothing in them that is uot discreditable to those of the northern pco people who make them. The President finds some outrages upon the negroes in various States, but be names South Carolina and Louisiana as sinners above all others. He names no other States. He says it is for Congress to do whatever is to be done, and that the Executive will do what he can. He will also make a renewed appeal to the courts, and to tne other State officials, to induce thein to correct these wrongs, as he regards them. It is a pity that our northern brethren have so much more sympathy with blacks than with whites. The President has not a word to say concerning the infamous bulldozing done in Massachusetts on the day of the same congressional elections. 'Twas ever thus. The northern fanatics cry over the negroes in (he South, and persecute their own laboring, classes. By the way, we are glad to learn that the President hasn't money enough to pnv the expenses of his efforts to " enforce the rights of citizens," and we hope that Congress will refuse to give him any more. Those minions of Federal power who arc appointed to carry tbe elections in favor of the Republican party might whistle for their money if we had the ability to withhold it. However, the President is still perfectly confident that we of the South are improving, and that all sectional troubles will end before long. Taerc is but one way to end them. Cease looking at and criticising the southern peo ple, and divide the country upon politico economical questions. " Then the whites of the South must divide. They agree upon only one thing? that they must protect themselves from your outrageous interfer ence with their affairs. Upon financial questions they might soon be divided into two parties, both of which would seek the negroes' votes and protect them in casting them. In a word, if the North will mind its own business and let us mind ours, there will be peace. Bnt it is insufferable that northerners should consider it their mission to regulate the affairs of the southern States. Our foreign relations are peaceful. The silver commission reached the gene ral conclusion that both gold and silver should be kept in the world's currency. Glad to hear it. The President has paid England ?5,500, 000 for allowing Yankees to fish in her wa ters ? money which waa collected in the South and elsewhere. Spain announces that the rebellion in Cuba is over, and the President expects au increased trade with th.it rich island. He will send to the Senate a new treaty with Japan. The Chinese Government has established a permanent legation in Washington. The treaty with the Samoan islands being ratified, the island is being surveyed to see il it will mnfce a suitable naval station. Mexico tries to keep the peace with us. She is to have an International Exposition next year. We want to go to it. He tells us about our South American neighbors and the expedition up the Ama zon. He intends to send like expeditions into Africa and the Indian ocean. Every man should read for himself what the President so briefly says as to the Trea sury Department, the finances, and the pos tal affairs of the country. Over $100,000,000 of four per cent, bonds have beepsold. He recommends for thrifty poor people that certificates of deposit as small as ?10 be is sued, bearing 3.00 per cent, interest. Ii so, they will all bo currency. He wants a' year of freedom from financial schemes. The President refers to the reports of.the .Secretaries. pf War, the Navy, and the Inte rior Departments. : Dull reading for most folks. He recommends hew circuit judges, the ? Federal courts being overrun with /busi ness. Hope we'll get rid of Bond. .He touches upon Indian affairs; the Hot Springs; the publictimber-lands, &c., &c. He tells us that our .annual agricultural productions are worth ^3,000,000,000, and that 1524,000, 000 -of them are exported. $To wonder our people want money that is good ?wsy irom -touches upon education; upon ani mals maltreated, in transitu upon railroads ; upon the public library juponthe Smith sonian Institution ; upon that institution's . mu^eaiu: upon the rlyer front; and upon warious District^rf^oJumbip matters; and 60 winds up hi* message. : V/ ' ^ : - -n , - - ?_* Norfolk Virginian opposes the sale of the James River and Kanawhacanalto t5ae R^imond and AJlegjaany Railroad Com aTp sorry to sef this opposition. ; 4 ? |g3?j g |?|||| . ?? / ' '.'O !-?'

TRADE-MARK DECISION". Judge Cadwalader, sifting: in the Circuit Court, this morning gave a decision of great importance, which, it is asserted, will piaeti cally and utterly strip alt trade-marks of the protection of tiieactof Congressof JulyS, 1ST0. The case, was a bill in equity brought by Day & Frick, soap manufacturers, of this city, against P. Walls, another extensive manufacturer, and an injunction was asked to restrain the use of the labels and wrap pers, employed by the defendant on his soaps, describing them in language similar to that registered at Washington as "Bleacher," "Bleaching,7' and with a de vice of a pair of scales an:1 other signs. The defendant, Wall, by Pierce Archer, Esq., his counsel, filed a demurrer to the bill, claiming that the act of Congress was ultra vires and beyond the constitutional power which authorizes Congress 44 to pro mote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries." George Buckler, Esq., counsel for the plaintiffs, relied on this grflnt under the Con stitution. Judge Cadwalader, in rendering a deci sion this morning, sustains the grounds for the demurrer . as filed by Mr. Archer. This decision, it is stated, affects hundreds of thousands of registered trade-marks all over the country, and decides, it is said, that hereafter the court has no jurisdiction to entertain this class of suits, which has here tofore constituted a large portion of the business of the Federal courts, The case is of such great importance that it will proba bly be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States at Washington.? Philadelphia Bulletin , 30 lh. .? - ? We think the question raised by the Slate newspaper as to the legality of the coming session of the Virginia Legislature one in which there is little to be said* in favor of the objection raised by our contemporary. The question is whether the new amend ments to the Constitution with respect to the legislative department go into effect now or not until November, 1879, the pe riod designated by the amendments them selves. We thiyk the amendments, fairly construed, fix that limit as the period for their going into effect. Put" the question is one which has been settled by the action of the Governor and Legislature. The ques tion is emineutly one of a political, not a judicial nature. * It is one of that class of questions upon which the political, as dis tinguished from the judicial branch of the Government, is alone competent* to pass. It has been settled by repeated decisions of the Supreme Court that purely political questions do not fall within the scope of the judicial power. The business of the courts is to determine questions of individual rights, and it is only Incidentally that they exercise, in clear cases, the power to pro nounce an act of a legislature unconstitu tional. When any department of the Gov ernment interprets the extent of its own Jurisdiction, the courts regard that exposi tion of its powers with the highest respect. Here we have the high political organs of our State solemnly deciding that as far as this coming session of the Legislature is concerued that the old Constitution and not the amendments is to govern. If this ques tion should come to a judicial test ween tertaiu no doubt but lhat suc'u will be the view taken by the Court of Appeals.? War reriton Index. In a series of riots at Jackson, Breathitt county, Ky., last week County-Judge John W. Burnett, .Thomas. Liule, and William Freeman, a colored man, were fatally shot. Daniel Freeman, brother of William, was dangerously wounded; The riots originated in an attempt to lescue a prisoner from the sheriff. Fighting has been going' on all the week, and the Governor has been culled on to quell, the-disturbance... -The town on Saturday was still in possession of the mob", but the sheriff's party had possession of the court-house and jail. Picket-firing was going on, and many persons had been killed and wounded. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his re port, treats the silver question more at length than the President, and it is under stood ho makes three recommendations? first, increasing the intrinsic value of the silver-dollar; second, limiting its coinage; third; reducing its legal-tender quality. The Secretary expresses the fullest confldebce in the complete success of resumption under the power conferred on bim by the present laws. He takes strong ground against the trade-dollar, and will oppose giving them a legal-tender quality or their redemption in legal-tenderraoney. .

Qur public credit has. greatly. Improved, and is, perbaps/now stronge&than ever be fore. Abundant; harvests have Rewarded the labdra of Jtliose who till .the soil, our mauufactuHnj? Industries are reviving, and it is believed that general prosperity, which has been so long anxiously looked for, Is at laj>t within our reach. The enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, been interrupted during the past season by the prevalence or a fatal pestilence? the yellow-f ever?in some 'portions of the southern State5, creating an emergency which called for prompt and ex traordinary measures of relief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and at other places on the lower Mississippi soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugitives from the infected cities and towns, and did not disappear until early In No vember. The States of Louisiana, Missis sippi; and Tenuessee- have suffered severe ly. About 100,000 cases are believed to have occurred? of which about 20,000, according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It is impossible to estimate with any approach to accuracy the loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Vol untary contributions of money and supplies in every needed form were speedily and generously furnished. The Government was able to respond in some measure to the call for help by providing tenia, medicines, and food for the sick and destitute, the re quisite directions for the purpose being given, in the confident expectation that this action of the Executive would receive the sanction of Congress. About 1,800 tents, and rations o! the value of about ?>25.000, were sent to cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be fur nished to Congress by the proper Depart ment. The fearful spread of this pestilence has awakened a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administration which shall not only control quarantine, but have the sanitary supervision of inter nal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers the public health, and which the municipal and State authorities are unable to regulate. The national quarantine act, approved April 29, 187S, which was passed too late in the last session of Congress to provide the means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season, is a step in the di rection here indicated. In view of the ne cessity for. the most effective measures by quarantine and otherwise for the protection of our seaports and the country generally from this and other epidemics, it is recom mended that Congress give to the whole subject early and careful consideration. The permanent pacification of the coun try by the complete protection of all citi zens "in every civil and political right con tinues to be of paramount interest with the great body of our p<jople. Every step in this direction is welcomed with public ap proval, and every interruption of Rteady and uniform progress to the desired con summation awakens general uneasiness and widespread condemnation. The recent congressional elections have furnished a di rect ..and trustworthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical establishment of the right of sufl'rage secured by the Con stitution to the liberated race in the south ern States. All disturbing influences, real or imaginary, had been removed from all of these States. ? The three constitutional amendments which conferred freedom and equality of civil and political rights upon the colored people of the South were adopted by the concurrent action of the great body of good citizens, who maintained the authority of the National Government and the integrity aud perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a wise and necessary, embodiment in the organic law of the just results of the war. The people of the former slavebolding States accepted these results, and gave in every practicable form assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuance thereof, should in good faith be enforced rigidly and impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citi zen, without distinction of race or color, should under them receive full and equal protection in person and property and in political rights and privileges. By these constitutional amendments the southern section of the Union obtained a large increase of political power in Congress and in the Electoral College, and the country justly expected that elections would proceed, as to the enfranchised race, upon the same ou'cumstances of legal and constitutional freedom aud protection which obtained in all the other States of the Union. The friends of law and order looked for ward to the conduct of these elections as ott'erinc to the general j udgment of the coun try an important opportunity to measure the degree in which the right of suffrage could be j exercised by the colored people, and would be respected by their fellow-citizens ; but a j more general enjoyment of freedom of suf frage by the colored people, and a more just' and generous protection of that free dom by -the communities of which they form a part, were generally anticipated than the record of the elections discloses. In some of those States in which the colored people have been unable to make their opin ions felt in the elections, the result is mainly due to influences not easily measured or remedied by legal protection ; but in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular congressional districts outside of those States, the records of the elections seem to compel the conclu sion that the rights of the colored voters have-been overridden, and their participa tion in the elections not permitted io be . cither general or free. It will be for the Congress for which these elections were held to make such examina tions into their conduct as may he appro priate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the mean while it becomes the duty of the executive and judicial departments of the Govern ment, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connection iu ?uy last message, that-whatever autfaoritj' rests with me to this ? end 1 shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwill ing .to forego a renewed appeal to the legis latures, the courts, the executive authori ties, and ' the people ol the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance towards bringing to justice the offenders and preventing a repetition of the crimes. No means within mv power will be spared ,to obtain a full andiair in vestigation. of the alleged crimes,- and to secure the conviction and Just punishment of the guilty. ,.t ... : It is to be observed that the principal ap propriation made for the Department of Jiisticc at the last session contained the fol lowing (Clause : " And for defraying tlie ex penses which may be. incurred in the en forcement of ..the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled / An act to amend an act approved May. 13, 1870, entitled An act to cn- ' force the rights, of citizens of the United States tp.

Each Stat?, I every political party; is entitled to the share ? i of power which is conferred by the legal and constitutional suffrage. It is weAKM Hr?srfs? ^*snaas"j?5 formally, submission to the results of the suffrage wilt be accorded loyally and Cheerfully, and all the" departments ol Government/Kill feel the true vigor of the popular will -.thus expressed. No temporary or administrative inter ns of Government, however urgest or wei^htv, will ever displace the zeal of ourpcople in dcfence of the primaryrights of citizenship. They nndcrstand protection of liberty requires the ma nte nance, in .tail vigor, or the manly methods of free specch, free press, and free i su and will sustain the full authority of Gov ernment to enforce the. laws which are framed to preserve these inestimable rights The material progress andwettareofthe States depend on the protection afforded o. their citizens. There can be no peace with out such protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is deeply in terested in the growth and prosperity of all While the country has not yet reached com plete unity of feeling and reciprocal confi dence between the communities so lately and so seriously estranged, I feel an abso lute' assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with increasing force. The powSr of public opinion will override ail political prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, in demanding that aii over our wide territory the name and acterof citizens of the United States shall mean one and tlie same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and re SPOu'r relations with other countries con tinue peaceful. Our neutrality in contests between foreign Powers has been mam ta The Universal Exposition at Paris during the past summer has been attended by larg numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and arrange ment of the contributions of our citizens to this great Exposition was well employed in enenretic and judicious efforts to o\er come tins disadvantage. These efforts led and directed by the Commissioner-Genual, were remarkably successful, and the exhi bition of the products of American indus try was creditable and gratifying in t scope and character. The reports of the United ?tates commissioners, giving its lesults In detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international compe i tion for the favor and trade of the world mav be expected to produce useful and im portant results in promoting intercourse, friendship, and commerce with other na ^ In accordance with the provisions of the act of Februarv 28, 1879, three commision ers were appointed to an international con ference on the subject of adopting a com mon ratio between gold and silver for the nurpos-e of establishing internationally the use of bi-metallic money, and securing hxity of relative value between those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various Governments which had expressed a will ingness to participate in its deliberations. The conference held its meetings in Paris in August last. The report of the commis sioners, herewith submitted, will show its results. No common ratio between golu and silver could be agreed upon by the con ference. The general conclusion was reach ed that it Is necessary to maintain in the world the monetary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection or the use of one or the other of these two metals, or of bot h, to be made by each State. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of ?5,500,000 to pay the award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after correspondence with the Lritisu Government on the subject of the conformi ty of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question tbere bv submitted to the Commission, the Presi dent shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communications upon these points were addressed to the British Gov ernment tbrouprb the legation of tbe United States at London. Failing to obtain the concurrence of the British Government in the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named within the year hxed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds of payment and a protest ajrainst any other construction of the same, iflic correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you. The Spauish Government has official ly "announced the termination ol the insurrection in Cuba, and the restoia tion of peace throughout that island. Confident expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity, which it is earnestly hoped may prove well found ed. Numerous claims of American rftizens for relief for injuries or restoration of pro perty have been among the incidents of lon?;-continued hostilities. Some of these claims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and others are promised early and careful consideration. The treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges has been duly ratified and proclaimed. No questions of grave importance have arisen with any of the European -Powers. The Japanese Government has been de sirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign Powers as relate to commerce, and, it is undeistood, has ad dressed to each of the treaty Powers a re quest to open negotiations with that view. The United .States Government has been inclined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan are found injurious to that people cannot but affect injuriously nations holding commercial intercouse with them. Japan, after a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations o Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which they hold with each other. ^ treaty looking to this end has been made, which will be submitted for the considera tion of the Senate. After an interval of several years the Chi nise Government has again sent envoys to the United States. They have been received, and a permanent legation is now established here by that Government. It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendly relations and removing causes of difference. The treaty with the Samoan islands having. been duly ratified ?nd accepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey and soundings of the harbor of Pago Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occu pation as a naval station if found desirable to the service. Since the resumption of diplomatic rela tions with Mexico correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two Governments upon the various questions which at once seemed to endanger their re lations'., "While no formal agreement, has been reached as to the troubles on the bor der, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has. done much to re move the sources of dispute, and it: is now . understood that a like force I of Mexican troops on the other side of , the river is also making an energetic move ment against the marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength In the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon our territory. Re luctant to assume any action or attitude in the control of these incursions by military movements across the border not impera tively demanded for the protection of the Jives and property or our own citizens, I shalUake the earliest opportunity consistent with the proper discharge of this plain duty to recognize the ability of "the Mexican Government to restrain effectively violations of our territory. It is propos'ed to hold nest year an International Exhibition in Mexico, and it Is believed that che display of the agricultural and manufacturing pro ducts of tho two nations will tend to better understanding and Increased commercial intercourse between their people.

L A uaarat expedition up the-'Araazdn and Madeira rivers has brought back informa tion valuable both for scientific and com mercial purposes. A like expedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to the de velopment ol our foreign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, and baye stimulated to prac tical exertion tbe enterprise of our people. Tbe report of tbe Secretary of the Treas ury furnishes a detailed statement of the operations of that department of tbe Gov ernment, and of the condition of tbe pub lic finances. Tbe ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended Jung 30, 1878, were ?257,703,878.70; the ordinary expenditures for tbe same period were ?236,964,326.80? leaving a surplus revenue for the year of 320,799,551.00. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, actual and estimated, are as follows : Actual receipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1878, 873,339, 743.43; estimated receipts for the remain ing three quarters of the year, 8191, 110, 256.57; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $284,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures, ?73,344,573.27; and for the remaining three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at 8166,755,426. 73? making the total expenditures ?240, 100,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for thc year ending June 30, 1879, of ?24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, estimated ac cording to existing laws, will be ?204,500, 000, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be 8236,320,412.68, leaving a surplus of ?28,179,587.32 for that year. In tbe foregoing statements of expendi tures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking-fund provided for by tbe act approved February 25, 18G2, which requires that one per cent, of tbe en tire debt oi the United States shall be pur chased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking-fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By its terms tbe public debt should have been re duced between 18(52 and the close of the last fiscal year ?518,361,806.28; the actual reduction of the ascertained ddbt in that period has been 8720.0*4,739.61; being In excess oi the reduction, required by the sinking-fund act 8202,282,933.33. The amount of the public debt, less cash ill the Treasury, November 1, 1S7S, was ?2,024,200,083.18? a reduction since the same dale last year of 823,150,617.39. The progress mr.de during the last year in refunding the public debt at lower rates of interest is very gratifying. The amount of four per cent, bonds sold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is 8100,270.900, and six per cent, bonds, com monly known as tire-twenties, to an equal amount have been or will be redeemed as calls mature. It has been the policy of tbe Department to place the four per cent, bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings* whether small or great, in these securities. The Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the law be so modified that small sums may be invested, and that through the post offices or other agents of the Government the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such investments. The best mode suggested is that the De partment be authorized to issue certilicates of deposit, of the denomination of ten dol lars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent, per annum, and convertible at any time within one year after their issue into the four per cent, bonds authorized by the refunding act, and to be issued only in cxchanerc for United States notes sent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert his money into aa iuterest bearimr security of the United States, and the money so received could be applied to the redemption of six per cent, bonds. The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year was ?52,79S,980. The coinage of silver dollars under the act passed February 2S, 1878, amounted, on the 23d of November, 1878, to ?19,814,550? of which amount $4.9S4,947 are in circulation, and the bal ance, ?14.S29,603, is still in the possession of the Government. With views unchanged in regard to the act under which the coinage of silver pro ceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secre tary faithfully to execute the law and to af ford a fair trial to the measure. In the present financial condition of the country I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will be best promoted by ab staining from all attempts to make radical changes in the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be un disturbed by governmental interference with the laws affecting it, and we may con fidently expcct that the resumption of specie-payments, which will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will be fol lowed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity. Let the healing influence of time, the in herent energies of our people, and the boundless resources or our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief from present ditiiculties will surely follow. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the army has been well and economical ly supplied that our small force has been nftiivelv emnloved. and has faithfully per formed all the service required of it. The morale of the army has improved, and the number of desertions hits materially de creased during the year. The Secretary recommends? 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry II. Benner, Eighteenth infantry, who lost his life by yellow-fever while In command oi the steamer J. 31. Chambers, sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers in the South from that disease. 2. Tbe establishment of the annuity scheme for tbe benefit of tbe heirs of de ceased officers, as suggested by the Pay master-General. 3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the records of the War of the Rebellion, now being prepared, for that purpose. 4. The increase ol the extra per tf.iem of soldier-teachers employed in post schools, and liberal appropriations for the evection of buildings for schools and libravies at the difi'erent posts. 5. The repeal or amendment o f tlie act of June 18, 1878, forbidding tbf. "use of the army as a posse comitates or otherwise, for the purpose of executing t'.ne laws, except in such cases and under 3V ch circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the Con stitution or by act of Congress." G. The passage of r. joint resolution of Congress legalizing Jtlie issues ot rations, tents, and medicine^ which were made for the relief of sufferr rs from yellow:fever. 7. That proviso? j be made for the erection of a tiro-proof building for the preserva tion of certain, valuable records now con stantly expose d to destruction by lire. These rer commendations are all com mended to Tyour favorable consideration. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows tti' tt the navy has improved during tbe.last 'liscal year, Work has been done on seventy-five vessels, ten of which have been thoroughly repaired and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress to wo rds completion. The total expenditures o' the year, including the amount appro proprKtedfor the deficiences of the previous year, were $17, 468.392.65. The actual ex penses chargeable to the year, exclusive Of these deficiencies, were 913,306,914.00. or i ?767,199.18 less than tfio?eot the previous year, and $4,928,677.74 less than the ex- 1 pensea, including tbe deficiencies. Tbe es Mm-tea im: J&e fiscal June-m 1880/ are $14,502,33r45^ataeedlng flic"ap ptopriationro! tb&'present year only $33, 94?.75 ; which excess is occasioned by tbe demands of tbe Naval Academy and tbe Ma rine Corps, as explained in tbe Secretary's report. Tbe appropriations for tbe present fiscal year are $14,528,431.70, which, in tbe opinion of tbe Secretary, will be ample for all tbeeurrent expenses of tbe Department du ring tbe year. Tbe amount drawn' from tbe Treasury from July 1, to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544.14, .of wbfeb $70, '980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expendi ture for that period $4,089,503.39, or $520, 899.24 les? than the corresponding period oi the last fiscal year. The report of tbe Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of the opera tions of the Post-Offlce Department. The expenditures of that Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $34, 165", 084.49. The receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order business, and official stamps, were $29,277,510.95. The ?um of $290,430.90, included in the foregoing state ment of expenditures, is chargeable to pre ceding years, so that the actual expendi tures for" the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are $33,874,647.50. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of the Department, was $5,307,052.82. The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are es timated at $36,571,900, and tbe receipts from all sources at $30,064,023.90, leaving a defi ciency to be appropriated out of the Trea sury of $5,907,876.10. Tbe report calls at tention to tbe fact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads for carrying the mail is regulated by law, and that tbe failure of Congress to appropriate tbe amounts required for these purposes docs not relieve the Government of responsi bility, but necessarily increases the defi ciency bills whieh Congress will be called upon to pass. In providing for the postal scrvice the fol lowing questions are presentid: Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be estab lished as will make the Department self-sus taining? Should the postal service be re duced by excluding from the maib matter which does not pay its way? Should the number of post-routes be diminished? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of the postal service? The International Postal Congress which met at Paris May 1, 1378, and continued in session until June 4th of flie same year, was composed of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted a new convention, to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne October 9, 1S74, which goes Into ellect on the lit of April, 1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratiCed and ap proved, by and with the consent of the President, August 13, 187S. A synop sis of this Universal Postal Convention will be round in the report of the Post ' master-General, and the full text in the appendix thereto. In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three countries, having a population of 350,000.000 of peo ple. On the 1st of April next it will com prise foity-three countries and. colonics, with a population of more than 650,000,000 of people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies which maintain organized postal scrvice?, constitute, in fact as well as in name, as its new title indicates, a Universal Union, reg ulatiug upon a uniform basis of cheap post ! age-rates the postal intercourse between all civilized nations. Some embarrassment has arisen out of the I conflict between the customs laws of this country and the provisions of the Postal ! Convention in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this coun try by mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of reconciling the difficulties which have thus been cre ated, so as to do justice to all parties in volved. The business of the Supremo Court, and of the courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such an extent during the past years that additional legislation is impera tive to relieve and prevent the delay of jus tice, and possible oppression to suitor?, which is thus occasioned. The encumbered ?condition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of the Attorney-General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for congressional action. The creation of ad ditional circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a complete remedy, and would in volve an expense? at the present rate of salaries ? of not more than SCO, 000 a year. The annual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner of In dian A flairs present an elaborate account of the present condition of the Indian tribes and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their interests. While the conduct of the Indians generally has been orderly, and their relations "with their neighbors friendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred which were deplorable in their char acter, but remained, happily, confined to a comparatively small number of Indians. The discontent among the Bannocks, which led first to some act* of violence on the part of some members of the tribe, and finally to the outbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on the reserva tion, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of tUe appropria tion:* made by Congress to the-wants of the Indians at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the troop's of the Uuited States, and several engagements, the hostile In dians were reduced to subjection, and the larger part of them surrendered them selves as prisoners. In this connection I | desire to call attention to the recommenda tion made by the Secretary of the Interior ! that a sufficient fund be placed at the dis posal of the Executive to be used, with proper accountability, at discretion in sud den emergencies of the Indian service. The other case of disturbance was that of a band of northern Cheycunes who suddenly i leit their reservation in the Indian terri tory and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their old -hunting-grounds, committing murders and other crimes on tficir way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior it appears that this disorderly band was as fully sup plied with the necessaries of life as the four thousand seven hundred other Indians who remained quietly on the reservation, and that the disturbance was caused by men cf a restless and mischievous disposition among the Indians themselves* Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to the miji- J tary authorities, and it' is a gratifying fact tbat when some of them had taken refuge iu the camp ol the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners, and rea dily gave them up to the oliicer* of the United States; thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at |he council of September, 1S77, had been complied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite in the recommenda tion that provision be made by Congress lor the organization of a corps of mounted ?' Indian auxiliaries," to be under the con trol of the army, and to be used for the pur pose of keeping the Indians on their reser vations, and preventing or repressing dis turbance on their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indiana ?>y withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employ ment under the Government, it being a matter of experience that Indiaus in our service almost without exception are faith ful in the performance of the duties as signed to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army in tho ac complishment of a task fur which its nu merical strength is sometimes found insutli cient. But while the employment ot force for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is ot occasional necessity, and wise preparatiou should be mad? to that end; greater reliance must bo r>t??^,i ? i and clvlllz ,'ng agencies {opr ^ boma?c H?ttonof wWt,i, n.

From the organization of the Govern ment, the importance of encouraging. ! r all possible means, the increase of "iir agricultural productions has been aekn ??' lodged and urged upon the atN-nt [ t Congress and the people as the -uiv-i nil readiest means of increasing our su! *t tial and enduring prosperity. The words of Washington are a< op; i ble to-day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said: '? It is not to be <1 ?> r U 1 that with reference either to ludiv: " national welfare, agriculture i> of pn::. ry importance.

The great preponderance of i la _'i k ;? - turnl over any other interest in the l'id.\d States entitles it to all the eon.-uic.'V. ^ claimed for It by Washington.
