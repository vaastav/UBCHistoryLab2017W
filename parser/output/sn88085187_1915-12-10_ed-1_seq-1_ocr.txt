Copyrighted, 1915. Peace voyages like that upon which Mr. Ford and his companions have embarked are an indication of a growing desire that something shall be done. The question Ift! not whether Mr. Ford's plan will meet with immediate success —time only can answer that question. The real question is whether it deserves success, and to this question every one who desires peace must answer "Yes." It can do no harm—it has already done good. It has started people to talk ing about peace here and in Europe—that is so much gained—and it has ex posed to contempt the sordid interests that ridicule all talk of peace. Then, too, there is an inspira tion in the esrnestness and un selfishness of a man of large ■wealth who is controlled by his heart Instead of his pocketbook. Health and safety to those w'.io sail; they are in search of some thing more precious than the golden fleece. Success attend them! One phase of the subject has not been sufficiently con sidered, namely, the RIGHT of the neutral nations to bring moral pressure to bear upon the belligerents to state the terms upon which peace ran be restored. The Hague convention expressly declares that an offer of mediation shall not be regarded as an unfriendly art. On the con trary, It is specifically cn oonraged on the ground that humanity, as a whole, is in terested in stopping a war. But the right of the neutral nations to urge peace rests on the ground of material interests as ■well as on the ground of human ity. They are bearing burdens of taxation which would not be necessary but for the war; do mestic questions are being subor dinated to Issues raised by the war; every neutral nation is in danger of being dragged Into the war and some are almost forced Into it. In each nation the financial vultures who live on the woes of their country are using the war •san argument in favor of in creased expenditures on prepar edness. Whyshould the nations at war obstruct the highways of the world, Interfere with neutral trade and endanger the lives of those who travel? All the neutral nations suffer, and those who •uffer have a right to complain. The president proposed mediation immediately after the war began, but that was 16 months ago. I regret that he does not see his way clear to make the offer again. The smaller nations wait on this nation and I fear the president has been deceived as to the wishes of the people. There are big corporations In pis country that are financially interested in the continuance of the war—corporations that sell ammunitions at an enormous pro fit and corporations that float war loans at a high rate, and tUese corporations speak through metropolitan newspapers. The masses have no voice ex cept as they speak through offi cials elected by them or through petitions. They should communi cate immediately and frequently with their representatives. In politics the fesr of the peo ple Is the beginning of wisdom; the people can ' easily control congress if they will only speak to congress In sufficient numbers.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 10. —Instead of the stereotyped re port such as the war department customarily sends to congress, Secretary Garrison today startled official Washington with a mes sage which In vivid language holds up to ridicule the advocates of non-preparedness. "There are those who do not feel free to base their conduct upon a consideration of facts or conclusions of rea son, because of their inter pretation of Divine injunc tion," says Garrison in his statement of the Wilson Mili tary policy. "They do not believe in re sistance to physical! force; and those whose consciences are so convinced surrender life and all that they i In.-it.li and love at tho behest of the aggressor. "This attitude concerns the individual and him alone. Hlnre it does not assume to be based upon fact or reason. It cannot lie dealt with on that basis. It cannot be made the general rule of conduct. "There are others concerning whose charity of vision we are not advised, and concerning whose soundness of reason we are not informed, because the at titude which they take is admit tedly not based upon either vision or reason. They are those who predict that war will never come to this country, and assert that - Talk o' the Times - Twenty-one days, then DRYERNELL! We merely quote the sporting editor.

"There are others among us who are too intelligent and clear sighted not to see the facts and to realize their significance, but who counsel inaction because they mistrust themselves and the na tion." Garrison goes on to assert that a reasonable preparedness is real ly a preventive of militarism, and that It Is in keeping, and not counter to, the nstional tradi tions. Following a detailed argument to back up these statements, he outlines the army plan recom mended by President Wilson in his annual message. If the Continental army plan does not succeed, he adds, some form of compulsory service will be made necessary. A Critical Area, This
