Rawlings, Baptist Preacher, and Alf Moore, Negro, Pay Murder Penalty FORMER'S SONS TO HANG FRIDAY The Case of the Murderers Has Pre sented Many Unusual Features, the Double Crime Resulting From a Family Feud Between Preachers Two Children of One Killed. Valdosta, Ga., Decemlber 4. J. G. Rawlinse and Alf Moore, tlhe latter a negro, were hanged here today for the murder of Willie and Carrie Carter, in July. 1905. Both stepped upon the scaffold without a tremor. Rawlings, ln his last statement, de clared tha^ he had told the truth, that his sons had no connection with the crime. Moore also declared that he had told the truth, again insisting that Mlllton Rawlings had fired the fatal shots. Valdosta, Ga., Dec. 4.—The crime for which J. G. Rawlings and Alf Moore, a negro, who were hanged today, pre sented unusual features. Rawlings and W. L. Carter were neighbors, twelve mil^s from here, and both were Baptist ministers. Several years ago a dispute arose as to the line between their respective farms. Litigation and bad blood resulted. Carter was wound ed by a shot fr»m ambush, and had Rawlings arrested on a charge -of at tempted murder a few days later. On June 13, 1905, a night attack was made on the Carter home. Two of Carter's children were shot, just outside the house, and shots were fired without ef fect at Carter and his wife and an other daughter. One of the wounded children informed his parents that Mil ton and Jesse Rawlings had shot him. He died next day. After shooting the children,, thevaltacking party attempted to set fire to the house, but were fired upon and driven off without further casualties. The coroner's jury found the crime had been committed by Mil ton and Jesse Rawlings and Alf Moore. The Negro Confessed Plot. The negro confessed, telling of a plot which had been planned by the elder Rawlings, for the murder of the en tire Carter family, and burning ^their home. J. G. Rawlings, elder, took no immediate impart in the crime, having gone to Valdosta to avert suspicion. The trial, which lasted two weeks, re sulted in a verdict of dfeath for the elder Rawlings, his sofes Milton and Jesse, and Moore. A third son, Leonard Rawlings, who was given a life sentence as an ac complice, then began a flight for life. Every legal expedient has been resorted' to causing the day of execution to be postponed from time to time, as each successive temporary advantage was gained by the defense. Sons to Hang Friday. The cases of the two Rawlings boys who are under sentence to be hanged Friday will come before the board of pardons Thursday. Sentence oC death has been passed upon Rawlings five times, but there now seems to be no dolibf that the long legal fight is over. All effort was made to save the fath er because he was not actually a mem ber of the party, but he made no plea for mercy. He said he wanted to be hanged, and that he would "meet the judge in hell." He asserted thatj he and his boys had been "tried by a set of illiterate degenerates." FUEDISTS KILL EACH OTHER. Two Men and a Woman Die in Fight Over Land Claiim.
