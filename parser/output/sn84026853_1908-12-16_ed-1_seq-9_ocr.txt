White House, Washington, Dec. 1, 1908. 1 My Dear Mr. Foulke: I have re- j MivoH vmir Ifittpr nf t.hfl 29th ultim') t and have read it in conrection with ] your previous letters enclosing ( quotations from the Indianapolis J News, a paper edited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The News states in one of ^ its issues that probably some of thr f documents dealing with the matter t have been destroyed. This is false. Not one has been destroyed. !t states that the last documents were t sent over in June of this year, the object of this particular falsehood being, apparently, to connect the matter in some way with the nomi- ^ nation of Mr. Taft. As a matter of fact, the last papers that we have received of any kind were sent over to us in May of 1904, and they have ^ been accessible to every human being who cared to look at them ever ^ since, and are accessib e now. * f * You quote the News as stating ^ that "the people have no official b knowledge concerning the Panama Canal deal." The fact is that the t( people have had the most minute t official knowledge; that every im- ^ nnrtant stpn in the transaction and every important document have been g1 made public in communications to e. Congress and through the daily J preBS, and the whole matter has been tj threshed over in all its details agaiu and again &nd again. * * The fact has been officially pub- aj lished again and again that the . Government paid $40,000,000,000, ? and that it paid this $40,000,000 di- ^ rect to the French Government, getting the receipts of the liquidator appointed by the French Government to receive the same. The United States Government has not the slightest knowledge as to the particular individuals among whom th<i French Government distributed the sum. This was the business of the French Government. The mere suu- ^ position that any American received ^ from the French Government a m "rake off" is too absurd to be discussed. j It is an abominable falsehood, and it is a slander, not against the American Government, but against the French Government. * * * * The President's brother-in-law was ^ involved in no scandal. iur. Del i- * van Smith and the other people who " repeated this falsehood lied about the President's brother-in-law; but r( why the fact that Mr. Smith lied should be held to involve Mr. Robinson in a "scandal" is difficult to understand. Th? scandal affects no a< one but Mr. Smith; and his conduct a has been not merely scandalous, but lc infamous. Mr. Robinson had not the w slightest connection of any kind, sort a or description at any time or under any circumstances with the Panama a matter. Neither did Charles Taft. * fi * * tl So far as I know there was no a syndicate; there certainly was no 's syndicate in the United States that a to my knowledge had any dealings V with the Government diroot'y "or ;! indirectly; and, in ismuch as there i was no syndicate, Mr. Taft naturall*' t could not belong to it. The New<j n demands that .Mr. la'i 3ppoal to v the evidence bv vhich it m'-ans r what it rail5? "the records." * * * \ All of three documents that pos- 1 ?essed any importance is illuxtrat- t ing any featu-e of th? transactions i have already boen made public i There remains a grer.t mais of iocu- * msnts of lit'le or no importance which the Administration is entire ly willing to have published, uu; which because of their mass and pointlessness, nobody has ov^r creJ to publish. Any reputable man can y hav? full access to these do<u- ? ment,s. * * * * < Mr. Delavan Smith is a conspictt- j ous o.ffender against the laws of 1 hones'v r>nd trut lfuln'"-?, b it U'; i does not stand ??Ione Tie occupies, i for instance, rhe same evil eminence with such men as Mr. Laffan, of the New ?>rK Sun, oditoiia'* of whose ^ paper you or others have from time i to time cailed to my attention, just | as you have called to my attention : these editorials of the Indianapolis News. Of tbe editorials thus sent ; me there Is hardly one which does not contain some wilful perversion o;" the truth. fMr. Roosevelt quotes for an example his re *ent statempnt in reply to a NVw York Sun storv, entitle:! "Roo.-ev^lt and Prarie Oil," and tu^n continue.?:) The fact is that these particular newspapers habitua'ly and continually and as a matter of business very form of mendaci'.y known to man from the suppression of the truth and the suggestion of the false to the lie direct.

TEDDY USURP POWER HAD NO RIGHT TO TEAR DOWN BUILDING. Col. Brownwell Claims He Cited Fact . of Lack of Authority, Roosevelt Giving Direct Order, Anyhow. Washington, Dec. 11.?Attention was called today to the fact that the J utterances of the President in re- < cnrH tn the action of Congress In * o- - - - ? ? ? ? limiting the use of the secret service c force 13 not the only action of the * executive that is considered by mem- r bers as objectionable. It became known today that the 3 jub-committee of the committee on c ippropriations, having in charge the ^reparation of the legislative, execu- 1 ;ive and judicial appropriation bill, ' ias been investigating the raising c )f the old Pennsylvania station thaj 0 vas located on the Mall until the ^resident had it torn down. ^ That the committee failed to ex>unge its inquiries about this action J rom the printed hearings is taken o indicate the temper of that com- ^ nittee toward the executive. When Col. Bromwell, military aide B o the President, and superintendent if public buildings and grounds, ap- v leared before the committee ReprcentatlveBurle9on, of Texas, asked C lira if he had not requested an apropriation last year for a watch- S lan for the old -depot. "I think so," replied Col Brom- e1 rell, "but I have not had any oc- B ation to use it, because I have torn own the railroad station." ei "What? Torn down the railroad G tation!" exclaimed the Texas memer. C Col. Bromwell explained that he sre down the building on the writ>n order from the President o? the C nited States. 'Do you know of any law on the N tatute books that authorizes any icecutive officer to sell any of the C. roperty of the United Staites of lat character, real estate?" inquir- fo I Chairman Tawney, of Minnesota te "No, sir," replied the Presidents ide. "I called the attention of thr- F Igher authorities to that fact, and received the order to tear the D uilding down." Replying further to the chairman D: ol. Bromwell said that he knew <f d immediate necessity for its re- Di oval. The committee also went into an Di camination of the government ofsials to ascertain what right the tr jmmission on country life appoint1 by the President, had to use the Di anking privilege, as it claimed was. ?ing done.

WILL GET EVEN The Wounded Religious Fanatic Swear Vengeance on Officers HE PLANS REVENGE On Police of Kansas City, Who Shot Him In Street Row?A Pltablo Story of Fanaticism and Superstition Told by One of the Dupes of the Holly Rollers. Kansas City, Dec. 11.?"I am not going to die. I am going to get well and live to kill a few more policemen." That is the assertion of Louis Pratt, self-styled "Adam God," th(. religious fanatic, who is lying in the jeneral hospital, seriously wounded in a battle between his followers an t ;he police Tuesday night. As a result of the fight Pratt's 13-year-oJd daughter, Lula, and Policeman Alber O. Dalbow are dead md two other policemen are in a :rltical condition. James Sharp, known as "Elijah I," and who was the real leader of he little band of religious enthusiists, is still at large. Shortly after the shooting ^Tueslay he walked Into a saloon, laid lown his revolver with the remark, i am satisfied; I give up." As there was no policeman present nd no one seemed inclined to take ilm into custody, Sharp waited a Qoment, then picked up the weapon, eloaded it and walked out. He has lot been seen since. Mrs. Pratt, with two of her young laughters, spent Tuesday night in he matron's room at police headuarters, but Mrs. Sharp, who flreu wo of the shots that struck Policeian" Michael Mullane, was confined a the city jail. "I've been in trouble before," said Irs. Pratt, " and If I can be killed or righteousness sake I shall be ternally happy." . Mrs. Pratt bemoaned the death of er other daughter, Lula, aged 13, ' fho was shot during the second tage of Tuesday's battle when the 'oman and her children pulled off i a rowboat in the Mississippi river nd attempted to escape. At the hospital it was said that 1 atrolman Mullane had small hance of recovery, but that Sereant Patrick Clark's condition was ] lightly improved. A. J. Selsor, the y-atander, who was hit by a stray 1 ullet, also is expected to get well. Mary Pratt, the little 11-year-old Ister of the dead girl, displayed the ame remarkable coolness shown by J er leaders when questioned by the olice. She did not cry when told f her sister's death. Mrs. Pratt, in a statement to the , ssistant prosecutor, told of the; , and's work. "Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, ur leaders," said Mrs. Pratt, "were ' ? oo Artnm flnri Rve and' uunu vv uo ? 'e believed their teachings. It was I evealed to Mr. Sharp last summer hat our meetings were not to bei iterfered with again. We armed i ' urselves. 'If the police attempt to 1 rrest you, shoot,' our leader said.: 'hey cannot kill me. I'll live for- 1 ver.' The first I heard of thai rouble Tuesday was when Lulu and lary came running down to the boat nd told me that the shooting was oing on. "Then the officers came and wantd to take us away. I got my rlflo own ofT the wall, told Lulu to got , gun, and we all got into a skiff hat was tied to the houseboat. 1 at in the bow with my gun in m^ land.

The officers began shoot ng at the boat. We drifted up to he bank and when I saw blood oa Lulu's ear I knew she was shot. Then Mary and I go out and hung )n the side of the boat until thev captured us." Mrs. Mellsf.a Sharp, a slender woman of middle age, whose statement tvas taken by another officer, detailed the occurrences leading up to Tues lay's fight and then told of the wanderings of the band. "I was horn In Mount Grove. Mo , 37 years ago, on a farm," said Mrs. Sharp. "I married Sharp, a farme.-, twenty years ago and we went to Arkansas. Later, we went to Oklahoma and took up a claim. We had no religion then. About six years ago my husband came home one night and said he did not think wo were living right. "Ho had bad a revelation of the faith of God.

We sold our farm and gave the money away to people who needed it, and started on the march. Since then we have traveled through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.
