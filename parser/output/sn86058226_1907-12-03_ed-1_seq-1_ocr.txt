LOCAL LIGHTING PLANTS ARE NOW MAKING MONEY. the Richmond Light, Heat & Power company has again come forth with a proposition to purchase the Richmond Municipal Lighting A: Power plant. This unexpected move was made last evening at council meeting, when i K. Lane, manager of the Richmond Light, Heat & Power' company, and At torney Wilfred Jessup, who represents the company, presented the following communication to council, copies of which were given to all the council men, city officers and newspaper men: November ilOth, RR7. To the Mayor and Common Council of the City of Richmond, Ind. Gentlemen: The undersigned is in terested in the operation and financial success of the Municipal Light plant in your city as is no other person or cor poration, for the two evident reasons that not only are we the second largest tax-payer, but we are likewise the only competitor of said plant. That our position may in no wise be misunder stood, we at once acknowledge our de fcire to purchase the city's plant, pro vided satisfactory negotiations may be carried through. We would be wil ling to accept a new franchise, safe guarding the city and the public as to rates for current that, may be charged In the future. Our desire to purchase Js inspired by reason of the fact that under present conditions of competi tion, this company is not, from the electric end of its plant, operating pro fitably, although operating, as we be lieve at a lower cost than the city's plant, with conditions more favorable ! legal advertising for the infant news to that-end. The existence of more ; paper and requested Mr. Cheeseman than one corporation furnishing the fame public utility leads to a duplica tion in the development of the plants in serving the community, and pre vents either plant from earning suffi cient interest on its investment to jus tify future extensions, which would be beneficial to the city's future growth. Therefore we request and petition that for the purpose of establishing a basis for further negotiations, and ar riving at an appraisement of true val ue of the plant, and for the further pur pose of accurate knowledge on the part of the city's officers, a firm of competent chartered accountants and electric engineers, trained in municipal investigation and satisfactory to both tne city and ourselves, be retained by the city to make such examination and appraisal, and to report at the earliest opportunity. The expenses incident to the same this company agrees shall be added -o any purchase price hereafter establish ed, should we purchase. And should ii sale not be consummated, we agree to reimburse the city to the amount of such expenses. THE 

RICHMOND LIGHT. HEAT A; POWER COMPANY, , v GE0RGJ2 BULLOCK, President. After the communication had been read, a motion was adopted to have a committee of three councilmen ap pointed, to consult with the board of public worKS in regards to the propos ed sale of the municipal plant. Mayor Richard Schillinger appointed the com mittee on contracts and franchises to represent the council in the matter. Councilmen Henry Deuker and Matt Von Pein, tried to be excused from this committee, but Mayor Schillinger in sisted that they serve. It is probable that the board and the contracts and franchise committee will make a re port to council at the next meeting. Although it is not set forth in the communication, the officials of the Light, Heat Ar Power company have stated that in the event the city agrees to dispose of the muuicipal plant to luuuollb regarding where the that company, a franchise naming the!raoney is to oome from to build the smallest possible rates for lighting and "tw contaSlon ward adjacent to the power, will be accepted.

Whether the citizens of Richmond ine Tuesday Afternoon at the hnmo rf desire to continue to operate the mu nicipal plant, or to abandon it, re mains to be seen. Friends of the plant argue that it has been an entire suc cess, and that it would be bad policy to sell out to the competitive company. Enemies of the municipal plant, point out that the money the city has ex pended in building, repairing and re modeling the plant, far exceeds the benefits the citizens have derived from it, and that the opportunity presented by the Richmond, Light Heat At Power company for the. city to rid itself of -j white elephant, should be taken ad vantage of. Before the municipal plant could be disposed of, it would be necessary to consult the citizens of Rienruond. !f the board of publicworks and the council committee on contracts and franchises report in favor of the sale ot the municipal plant, council will in all probability order a special election so that it can be definitely learned whether the citizens favor the sale or the retention of the plant. A Paper Is to Be a Democratic Organ and Will Be A Weekly. FIRST ISSUE ON DEC. 6TH. EDITORS ARE O. H. DOWNEY AND E. P. SHOCKLEY EFFORTS TO LOCATE OFFICE OF NEW CON CERN FRUITLESS. Richmond has a new newspaper. It is called "The Wayne County Demo crat." The editors are O. H. Downey, and E. P. Shock ley. Just who these gentlemen are or whore the office of the new newspaper, which is to be published weekly, is located cannot be learned. The first intimation the workers on the two Richmond daily papers re ceived that there was a new newspap er ia the field, was this, morning when W. K. Cheeseman, trustee of Center township, showed a letter and circu lar he had received from the editors of the Democrat. The letter solicited to contribute an article on the new depository law, so that it could be published in the issue of December 6. The circular stated in bold type that Richmond was at last to have a Democratic paper. It was to be devot ed to the interests of the county, and that a special department for the city of Richmond would be included. Near the end of the circular was the state ment that the Democrat was to be published in the interest of The In diana Anti-Salary Grab League, what evert hat is. It. stated that Mr. Shock ley was president and Mr. Downey secretary of this league. The vice president, according to the circular, is W. A. Weiser of South Rend. The Democrat is opposed to the creation of an official class and long terms in public office. The letter and circular were in spots soaked in coal oil which 's evi dence that the member of the Demo crat editorial staff who prepared the same, has been making use of the midnight lamp. All efforts to locate the office of the new newspaper and its editors were fruitless. It is re ported that the paper is to be publish ed outside the city.

Washington, Dec. 3. Washington presents a busy scene today. Natio nal lawmakers are hustling hither and thither, however always taking time to whisper into the ears of eager friends the contents of their pet meas ures. Every one is on the quivive ov the contents of President Roosevelt's message. Its probable effect on the country at large was the predominat ing note struck in all conversation among law makers to Jay.' The meeting of the Sixtieth con gress Monday resembled a social func tion rather than the gathering for the transaction , of important business of the country. The only thing lacking was the boquet of flowers on the desks of members. The most import ant business transacted was the re election of Joseph G. Cannon aa speaker of the house. Uncle "Joe" won over John Sharp Williams, of Mississippi, by a vote of 207 to 134. The senate and house met promptly at the noon hour. The renate adjourn de at 12:37. So great was the demand for an op portunity to see the National legisla ture started in its work that the gal leries of the house were reserved for the families and friends of members, with very few places left for the gen eral public unprovidel with tickets. In the senate the same condition pre vailed, except that a larger space was kept for those who came without tick ets. Early in the day the capiiol was fill ed with spectators and in all the cor ridors leading to the gallery entran ces there were lines of men and wom en extending for long distances, and many of these people stood for two hours in a vain hope of gaining ad mission, as the more fortunate should become wearied in watching the pro ceedings and give up their places.

DISCUSSIOH The City Council Does Much Talking But Takes Lit tle Action. DECIDED POLES MUST GO. MAIN STREET WILL BE CHANGED FROM ITS FOREST LIKE AP PEARANCESTUDY AND DEVJ KER HAVE SPIRITED CLASH. At council meeting last evening thre was a long discussion on the Main street pole ordinance. There was more talk than action. Council man Deuker started the discussion by stating that it was his understanding that the pole ordinance was now in force. He wanted to know if such was the case, why the ordinance was not being enforced and why the city, which was effected by the ordinance through the municipal plant, had made no ef fort to comply with its terms. Con trary to a statement made Monday by President Merrill of the board of pub lic works. City Attorney Study did not submit a communication on this ques tion. When questioned as to whether he thought the ordinance was legal Mr. Study stated that he thought it was, inasmuch as he had drawn it up by or der of the council. Mr. Study stated that he also was cf 0 A C WAS the opinion that the ordinance should attorney should be censured because h be enforced. A discussion then arose said council was careless in givins? us to whether tiie additional time away public franchises.

The ma-j the clerk inform the effected corpora jority of the councilmen favored the tions to remove their wood poles from immediate enforcement of the ordi- j Main street. - nance. j . j Mr. Study stated that w hile he was i of the opinion the pole ordinance was enective and fair he believed that in the event an effort was made to enforce it, complications would arise owing to the fact that on June IS, I'.KXi, the council passed an ordinance compelling j telephone companies to either place their wires underground or on poles removed from Main street. In this or dinance minimum and maximum rates were established. Mr. Study stated that this ordinance discriminated against the Central I'nion company, and because council had attempted to usurp the authority of the board of public works and" establish rates in this ordinance he did not think It was "worth a snap of his fingers."' Mr. Study stated that he saw no reason why the city, the street car company and the Light, Heat & Power company couia not get togetner ana, in compli ance with the pole ordinance, erect a joint line of iron poles on Main street. He stated that the Li-;ht, Heat & Pow er company was willing to enter into such an arrangement with the city and that the street car company could be forced into it in the event such a course was necessary. Councilman McMahan took a rap at the board because the city had made no effort to comply with the pole ordi nance. Mr. Study explained that the city had tanen no action because the city did not own any poles on Main ; street. This statement was disputed by Mr. Deuker who said that when the pole ordinance, when it was passed, de- veloped the fact that it would cost the city in the neighborhood of $1.S00 tojger. patrol driver, who for nearly a j remove its poles from Main street, j year has been on sick leave, tendered; 'After a consultation with Mr. Merrill.! his resignation Saturday.
