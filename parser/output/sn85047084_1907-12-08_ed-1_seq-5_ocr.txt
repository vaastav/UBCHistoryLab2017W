The Great Seal of the South African Republic is not to be sold by auction after all. The protests raised in South Africa against such a course, backed up, no doubt, by the Transvaal government, have led the colonial office to intervene, and it is now certain that the seal will pass into possession of the crown. The seal, it is stated, has been, for some time past, in the possession of a quartermaster sergeant who was en gaged in the late war. According to his own account, he obtained it from a Boer, who was in the act of burying it. Quite recently the soldier sent the seal to this country to be disposed of, and the announcement of the sale created great interest. The seal is in the form of a circular steel matrix, and is 2 inches in diam eter. In the center are the arms of the South African republic a lion couch ant in the top left hand corner of the shield, an armed Boer in the opposite corner, a wagon in the lower half and an anchor in the center space. The arms are surmounted by an eagle, and are flanked on either side by three flags, while below is the motto: "Eend raeht maakt Magt," ('XTnion makes strength"). There is a circular in scription, "Government Zuid Afrika ansche Republiek," round the edge of the seal. The seal dates back to 1SS4, the date of the convention granting the inde pendence of the republic, and was used to ratify the measures passed by ths legislature, as well as to seal official communications between the Trans vaal and Great Britain. It was im pressedfor the last time upon Mr. Kruger's ultimatum presented to the British agent at Pretoria on October 9, 1899. . - Five thousand three hundred and eighty-seven copies of Picturesque Ho nolulu were sold over the counter in the Advertiser office yesterday.

My friend ; "Woolley printed an essay oa Honolulu's political iniquities the other day which was warm medicine. I agreed with every word of it, premise, advice,-conclusion and anathema but for some reason or other it made me mad. This set me to analyzing myself. Why should I grow angry over a statement I know to be true, which I had made myself with no rhetorical skill to compare with Woolley 's, and which was intended to help a local cause which has been mine for years? Was I jealous of Woolley ? Xp, not that. From sueh an infirmity I felt myself free, but yet that article made me grit my teeth. Then it suddenly dawned on me why. I was a Honolulan, bred in the bone and tatooed in the flesh, and Honolulans, as a family, always get mad when a stranger comes and mixes in their quarrels and tells them, what he thinks of them. The trouble with Woolley as a local reformer is that he is too new. Some of his predecessors in the Anti-Saloon work were also too new and they made so little progress the first year that they did not stay through a second. Hatter, the great detective, ran up against the same clannishness. When he eame, one-half of this community was in arms against the other half; and the other half was accused of the direst sort of offences, Hatter was employed to look these misdemeanors up and he got together a lot of first-class evidence. But no Honolulu jury would convict, no matter how strong a case Hatter might make. It wasn't because doubt of guilt was raised; it was simply be cause our people didn't want any stranger to come down here and hound any of our f ell ow-eitizens- to jail. We would willingly do the hounding ourselves and we knew that the jail fairly yawned for leaders of the opposition but we wouldn't stand for Hessians. Ministers have had the same difficulty. Lots of good men have queered themselves because thev sailed into been- here long enough to stop calling the group the Sandwich islands. The late Judge Estee'made the same mistake. But none of these people eve went for us with the verbal fluency, the epigrammatic sting and the shrewd discern-. ment of John G. Woolley. And that is the reason I am certain that his per sonal work here will be of no avail. Judge Whitney finds that Hawaii county is rotten with graft. It is a Home Rule county, so no one neied be was unkind to him when she put him on Oahu in the midst of a Republican majority, though he may, counter on misfortune by moving to Hawaii himself. He would be a star of magnitude there; and as the roads are longer on the volcano isle and require more men to work on them, he might retire, a few years hence, with a competency. 8 . "What have you in that package!" asked the customhouse officer. of the new reporter, as the latter was leaving the wharf whence the Siberis. was about to sail. "It's a steak; what did you think it was?" asked the new reporter. "It doesn't make any difference what I think," replied the customhouse officer, "the question is what is in the package." "I'll give you a roast for that,',' retorted the new reporter, and with this parting bon mot the incident closed. SMALL (Continued from Page Four.) CAPTAIN DREW New.

TOWSE The demand for an market has never made itself felt, but there is a demand for such an auditorium on the Aala park site. That is the great meeting place of the people and any-, thing that can encourage the people to come out there into the fresh air ought to be helped on. The evening band concerts in Aala park and the Saturday and Sunday baseball games are making business poor for the police. If we had an auditorium there for the people why let them. That 's their business, . , ' COMMERCIAL NEWS. (Continued from Pare Four.) Announcement has been made by the. Haiku Sugar Co., whose stock had sold at 127 1-2, that it will discontinue its monthly dividend beginning January 2. Heavy expenditure for improve ments the past season is given as the reason. As Haiku has been paying one and a half per cent, monthly, the suspension of dividends comes with the force of a shock. It is reported that Hindu laborers, driven from town to town in the Northwest by labor agitators, wiH be shipped to Hawaii. A few more la borers from the Philippines are under stood to be on their way to these is lands. Japan is announced as now willing to submit to American exclu sion of Japanese laborers, but wheth er a compact of that kind will include Hawaii remains to be seen. In the meantime the Spaniards and Portu guese introduced this year, to the round number of five thousand, are by all accounts both satisfied and giv- mg satisfaction on our sugar planta- tions. A special meeting of Kihei Planta tion Co. is called for December SO to consider a proposition to sell its prop erty on a basis wThich will net the company $500,000 clear of all outstand ing debts. Kihei's paid-up capital is $2,500,000, so that the proposition means a realization of one-fifth the par value of stock. Last sale of the $50 shares was at 8.50 and 9 is the present asked price. The few shares of stocks reported sold the past week evidence a sharp J decline In the choicest. Transactions were as follows: Waialua ($100), 20 at 61; Ewa ($20), 5 at 22.75, 10 at 22.50. 60 at 23, 50 at 22.12 1-2, 5 at 22.50, 170 at 22; Oahu ($20). 25 at 23.62 1-2; O. R. & L. Co. ($100), 5 at 93; Honolulu Rapid Transit ($100), 20 at 50; Haiku ($100), S at 125; O. R. & L. Co. 6s, $2000 at 100; Cal. Refinery 6s, $2000 at 98.50. Dividends announced on December 5 were: Onomea (San Francisco), 20 cents a share; H. C. & S. Co., 65 cents a share; Pepeekeo, 1 per cent.

R. P. Schwerin, president of the Pa cific Mail Steamship Co., at the din ner of the naval architects in New York lately, said that the failure .of the government to support its mari time industries was fast driving the American flag from the Pacific as wtil as the Atlantic. He intimated that the Pacific Mail directors would not sanction a continuance of business under present conditions. The com pany would not apply for a renewal of its charter, which expires on April 15 next, and would go out of business on that date. Willis T.
