WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. The presi--Jeut's message delivered to congress is in utile and exhaustive doeiiment of some lS.'sitj words. We give below the main features: "At the out.-oing of the old nnd the in foming of the new century you begin the i.isl session of the rifty-hixth congress ith evidences on every hand of individu al and national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength nml increasing power for good of republican institutions. Your countrymen will join with you in felicitation that American liberty is more firmly established than ever before and that love for it and the di termination to preserve it lire more universal than, nt any former period of our history. "Ill our foreign intercourse the domi nant question has been the tr iitnient of tlie Chinese problem. Apart from this our fruitions with the powers have been Itap- I'lie president then rehearses the origin and growth of the recent disturbances in I China, the lighting at Tnku, the siege and relief of the legations at Peking ami the licciipation of Ticn-tsin and outlines the irwlky of the I'nited Stales as follows: Ol'K 

POLICY IN CHINA. The policy, of the 1'uited States through all this trying period was clearly announced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers dated duly S proclaimed our attitude. Treating tlie condition in the north as one of virtual lunrchy. in which the great provinces of (tie south ami southeast had no share, e regarded the local authorities in the latter quarters as representing the Chi csp people with whom we sought lo re Biain In peace and friendship, Our de clared aims involved no war against the Chinese nation. We adhered to the legit imate ollice of rescuing the imperiled le gation, obtaining redress for wrongs al ready suffered, securing wherever possi tic the safety of American life nnd prop erty In China and iceventiiitt a spreud of toe disorders or their recurrence - As was then said, 'Hie policy of the goveiuuieut of the tuited btates is to rek ft anlntlott tvhlch may ViritiR about permanent anfety nnd peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial nnd adminis trative entity, protect all rights guaran teed to friendly powers by treaty and in tornntionnl law and safeguard for the world tho principle of equal nud impar tial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire.' "Faithful to those professions which, ns It proved, reflected the views nnd pur poses of the other en-operating govern ments, all our efforts have been directed toward ending the ntioiiialons situation In China by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our legation nnd its dependents was accomplished we withdrew from Relive hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Peking as a channel of negotiation nud settlement, a course adopted by others of the Interested powers." The president then apenka of the prom inent part tnjicn by the ITniled States nt the l'aris exposition and of our amica ble relations with l'rnnce, Germany and Great It i It n In and refers to the Satuoan sett lenient as follows: "The settlement of the Snmonn prob lem, to which 1 adverted In my last mes sage, lias accomplished good results. I'eace nnd contentment prevail in the is lands, especially in Tutuila, whcie a convenient administration that has won the confidence and esteem of the kindly disposed natives has been organized un der the direction of the mimnnndcr of the I'lilted States naval station at Tango-Tango." The Alaskan boundary question Is nr-xt referred to. The growth of Jnpnn is commented upon, as is also our thriving commercial intercourse, with Mexico. After speaking of tlie international arbi tration movement the president turns to the subject of an iuterocenuic canal. He says: "The all Important matter of nn Inter occnuie canal has assumed a new phase. Adhering to its refusal to rcojien the question of the forfeiture of the contract of the Maritime Canal company, which was terminated for alleged noncxeciition 111 October, IS!)!), the government of Ni caragua lias since supplemented that ac tion by declaring the ho styled Kyre Crngin option void for nonpayment of the stipulated advance. Trotests in relation lo these acts have been tiled in the state department and are under consideration. Deeming itself reliovcd.froin existing en gagemunts. the Nictiyigua government shows a disposition r deal freely with the canal question either in the way of negotiations with the I'nited States or by taking measures to promote the wa terway. "Overtures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the auspices of the I'nited States are under consider ation. In the meantime the views of the congress upon the general subject, in the light of the report of the commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various trausisthminn ship canal projects, may be awaited. "I commend to the early attention of the senate the convention with Great Britain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and lo remove any objec tion which might arise out of the con vention commonly called the Clayton Hulwer treaty." Our relations with Spain and Turkey are next treated, and then follows a statement of the gratifying liiiiinci-il con dition of the country, with comment up on our increasing foreign trade, the growth of manufactures and ngriculturul production. Ucganliug the internal reve nue the president says: "I recommend thut the congress at its present session reduce the internal reve nue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with Spain in the sum of 810. 

OUO.IHHI, This reduction should be secured by the remission of those taxes which ex perience has shown to be the most bur densome to the industries of the people. "I specially urge that there be included ill whatever reduction is made the legacy tax bequests for public uses of n literary, educational or charitalJe character. "American vessels during the past three years have carried about ! per cent of our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, not the greatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steel industries, the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade and our steadily maintained expenditures for the navy have created an opportunity to place the I'nited States in the tirst rank of commercial maritime powers. "Hesides realizing a proper national as piration, this will mean the establishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a distinctive national industry, expand ing the field for the profitable employment of labor nnd capital. It v. ill increase tlie transportation facilities and reduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the interior to the seaboard for export; and will strengthen an iirni of the national defense upon which the founders of the government and their successors have relied. In again urging immediate action by the congress on measures to promote American ship ping nnd foreign' trade I direct attention to the recommendations on the subject ill previous messages. THK TIU'ST EVIL. "In my last annual message to the con gress 1 called attention to tlie neei ssity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to exist In connection with combinations of capital organized into trusts and ngain invite attention to n' dis iission of the subject at that time, which conoliidid with these words: " 'It is apparent that uniforniily of leg islation upon this subject In the several states Is much to be desired. It Is to be hoped that such uniformity, fotidded In a wise and just discrimination between what is injurious ami what is useful and necessary in business operations, may bu obtained nnd that menus may be found for the congress, within the limitations of lH constitutional power so to supple- nient an effective code of slate legislation ns to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the aula tarv rules to which I have referred. " 'The whole question is so Important nud farreai hing that 1 am sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every utilise of it will have the studied deliber ation of the congress, resulting in wise and judicious action. "Restraint upon such combinations ns nre injurious and which me within fed eral jurisdiction should be promptly ap plied by the congress. THE PHILIPPINES. "In ni.v last annual message I dwelt nt some length upon the condition of affairs in the Philippines. bile seckbig to in) press ilium you, that the grave responsi bility of the future government of thoso Islands rests with the congress or tlie United States, I abstained from recom mending nt that time a specific and tiual i .'I iim.-tti ' actually held by the 1'nited S form of government for the territory Slates forces 1 ami i which us long as Iusur insurrection con tinues the military nrni must necessarily be supreme. 1 stated my purpose, until the congress shall have made kuowu the formal expression of Its will, to uso the authority vested lu me by the constitu tion nnd the Btatntes to uphold the sov ereignty of tha I'nited States In those distant Islands ns in all other places where our ling rightfully floats, placing to that end at the disposal of the army (i ml navy all the means which tlie lib erality of congress nml tho people have provided. No contrary expression of the will of the congress having been made I have steadfastly pinsued the purpose so declared, employing the civil arm as well toward the ncconiplishmcnt of pneificn tion and the institution of local govern ments within the lilies of authority and law. "Progress in the hoped for direction has been favorable. Our forces have successfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the organized forces of insurgents and carrying order and administrative regularity to all quar ters. What opposition remains is for the most part scattered, obeying no concerted plau of strategic action, operating only by methods common to tin" traditions of guerrilla warfare, which, while Ineffect ive to niter the general control now es tablished, lire still sulii.ieiit to beget in security among the populations that have felt the good results of our control ami thus delay the conferment upon them of the fuller measures of local self govern ment, of education and of industrial and ngriculturul development which we stand ready to give to them. "lly the spring of this yenr the ef fective opposition of the dissatislied Tn gals to the authority of tlie United Slates was virtually ended, thus opening Die door for the extension of a stable admin istration over much of tlie territory of the nrchipelngo." The president then speaks of the ap pointment of nml instructions to thu I'liilippine commission nnd the proclama tion of amnesty and says: "Later reports lioni the commission show yet more encouraging advance to ward insuring the bcnelits of liberty and good government to tlie Filipinos in the interest of humanity and with the aim of building up an enduring, self support ing niul self administering community in those far eastern seas, 1 would impress upon the congress that whatever legisla tion may be enacted in respect to this Philippine Inlands should be along these generous lines. The fortune of war h.ns thrown upon this nation an unsought trust which should be uusejfishly dis- harged and devolved upon this govern ment a moral ns M as material respon sibility toward these millions whom we have freed from nil oppressive yoke. I have on another occasion called the Filpinos 'the wards of the nation.' Our obligation as guardian was not lightly as sumed. It must not be otherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benelit those who have come under our fostering care. Il is our duty so to treat them that our Hug may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and the fertile zones of Mindanao and Negros than it is nt home; that there, as here, it shall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlighten ment and progress m every avenue of development." The situation in Porto llico nnd Culm receives extended treatinetit, anil the president renews the recommendation made in u special message of Feb. 10, IS! I!

There is no room for fur- j ther rcifortioti here. "It must be apparent that we will ro- ' quire an army of about (10,000 and that during present condition iu Cuba and the Philippines the president should have ' authority lo increase the force to thu present number of uni.ooo. included in this number authority shouli be given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taft commission be lieves will be more effective in detecting ami suppressing guerrillas, assassins and lndroncs than our own soldiers. "I favor the recommendation of the secretary of war for the detail of nlhVcra from the line of the nriny when vacancies occur iu the adjutant general's depart ment, inspector general's department, quarteni'iister's department, subsistence department, pay department, ordnuuee department and signal corps. The rapid growth of the postal service is next touched upon and extension of ru ral free delivery urged. The etticiciicy of the navy is briefly i-poken of, and the re cent armor plate settlement receives fa vorable comment. Pensions, territories, the twelfth census and ngriciiltiire each receives consideration, ltc apportionment of representation according to the census returns is recommended. In closing the president says: "In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger It invites of ex travagance iu government expenditures und appropriations, and the chosen repre sentatives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish nn exuiuple in their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbands for the future. In this era of great business activity and oppor tunity caution is not untimely. It will not abate, out strengthen, contidiffce; It will not retird, but promote, legitimate industrial and commercial expansion. "Our growing power brings with It temptations and perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be use 1 to invite conllicts nor for oppression, but for the more effective niainteniuice of those principles of equality- and justice upon which our institutions nnd happi ness depends, Let us keep always iu mind that the foundation of our govern ment is liberty; its superstructure, peace."
