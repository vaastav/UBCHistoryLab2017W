GETS IT FROM THE PAPERS. In No Other Way Does President Elect Know That lie Is Elected. Mr. McKinley will have to learn from the newspapers that he has re ceived a majority of the electoral votes and has been duly and formally elected president of the United States. When a $900 government clerkship is filled, the appointee receives a notice from the civil service commission. A member elect of congress is given a certificate by the secretary of the state in which he lives. A postmaster, after being con firmed by the senate, is given a commis sion. But the citizen who is elected to the highest office in the gift of the American people receives no notice, no certificate, no commission. Several years ago, after the uncom fortable experience in 1876, congress passed an electoral law, setting forth in much detail the procedure for the recep tion and canvass of ballots oast by the electors. These electors meet at the state capitols and prepare the returns. Three sets of returns are forwarded from each state to Washington. Thay are guarded with great care. On the ap pointed day the senators march over to the house, and, in joint session, with much formality, every step iu which is directed by law, the returns are can vassed. Then the vice president an nounces the names of those chosen for president and vice president for the term beginning on the 4th of March. With that the formalities end. There is no provision for any notice to the two men found to be elected. When Mr. George F. Edmunds was in the senate, he hud a good deal to do with tho drafting of the elaborate law under which the electoral votes are now canvassed. He was asked ono day how a man elected to the presidency was go ing to find it out. "By reading the newspapers, " was the reply. As inauguration day draws near a committee of senators and representa tives is appointed to have in charge the arrangements. This'rXjmmittee usually has some correspondence with the presi dent elect to learn his personal wishes regarding the programme. Nothing, however, iu the form of au official state ment of the canvass of the returns is sent to the president elect. When the proper time comes, Mr. McKinley, having read in the newspa pers that be has been elected, will go to Washington. He will call upon Presi ii t Cleveland. An hour later Presi nt Cleveland will call upon Mr. Mc Kinley. These calls will take place a day or two before the 4th of March. On the morning of the 4th President Cleve land will come to the hotel again, take Mr. McKinley in au open barouche be hind four black horses and ride with him to the senate wing of tha capitol. There, in tho president's room, the com mittee of arrangements will inoet the president elect and the president to es cort them to the senate chamber. That will be the first official information Mr. McKinley will receive that be is to be come president of the United States. All of the information that ho has had to guide him up to that moment will have been derived from the newspapers. Ten minutes later Mr. McKinley will put his hand on the open Bible and be sworn by Chief Justice Fuller. That act will make him president of tho United States. Without a scrap of paper to show his authority he will enter upon ; da ties as president. The act of President Cleveland in call ing for Mr. McKinley and escorting him to the senate is one of courtesy only. President Cleveland will learu that Mr. McKinley is to be his successor in the same way that Mr. McKinley will through the newspapers. It is within the memory of many now living that a president declined to perform this act of courtesy and that a president elect made his way aloue to the capitol to be re ceived by the senate and sworn. Presi dent Andrew Johnson refused to go with General Grant. It seems singular that with nil of the elaborate electoral programme there should bo no provision for au official notification of his election to the presi dent elect and that with ull of the cere mony of inauguration there should be issued no commission, no proclamation, to give official information of a change of administration. St. Louis Globe Demoorat A Famous Krigand. The famous brigand Tiburzi of Italy, vnn was recen tlv killed by the polioe, bad been a brigand for 40 years. For a long time he was the real ruler of a large district. He imposed taxes upon the population and in return guaranteed public order. Every on paid willingly, and there were no longer robberies or crimes of any kind. He constituted him self the local polioe force. At the elec tions of 1893 be took over the politioal arrangements of the district In fact, he became the grand elector. He brought out bis candidate, instructed all his sub jects to vote for him, and the result was a magnificent viotory. In the last few months he frequently paid visits to Borne, Florence, Paris and other cities for pleasure. The police who killed him owed their triumph to the treachery of one of his bandit companions. Bishop Keane. Miss Fannie Whelan of Washington is the treasurer of a fund now being raised by prominent Catholics in Wash ington and Baltimore, to be presented to Bishop Keaue, who is at present the guest of Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell of San Jose, CaL "It is a well known fact," aava the Baltimore American, "that when he shook the dust of the Catholic university from his feet, and with pained and sorrowful heart started for California, where he is now, he wag practically penniless. Bishop Keane's income has been dispensed iu charity these many years. He cared nothing for money, 6ave when he could get it for the advancement of the university, for which he collected hundreds of thou sands, and when be could relieve some destitute case which might be brought to his notice."
