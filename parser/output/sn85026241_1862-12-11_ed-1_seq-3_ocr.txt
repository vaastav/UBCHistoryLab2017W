[From the New York Tribune.] Tn the stormy era In which it has pleased God to oast nur lot, it is well that a country so tried ss ours should have one among its leaders in whose integrity, patriotism, and uncalctilating devotion to the noblest ends, all may and doennfiiria. .That man is Abra ham Lincoln. To disparage his abilities, criticise his rhetoric, pmnotinue him too fast here or too slow there, may not be diffionlt; but thore lives no loyal American who dis trusts his earnest dosirie to servo and save the Union. Whon faction. Meaning to stop just short of treson. affirms that the War lor tho Union is only prosecuted for the aggrandizement of contractors and Jobbers that those whoiuot esrtie.tly snpport the Fedeml Unvernmuiit areiiite hs responsible ior tho lldlielhon as tho-e who fomented inaua-urated. and still uphold it it is con fronted by the presence in the foreground of one msn who refused to the last to believe Treason, Disunion and Civil War to be seriously nunmscd wlio, in hia Inutiitusl. condescended to (.lead with the architects of ruin anil entreat them to pause in their mad career who hesitated to shod blood, even in vindication of rightful, essentia authority, until absolutely forced to do so by the cotisoirators for Disunion conimnen- ciug the tray and who, IVouf that moment to the present, has been unxious only to secure a return, at the earliest possible mo ment, to the mild sway of Law, Order, and reace. Mr. Lincoln's Message discusses many top icsof Brave interest, and embodies many im portant suggestions; but the interest of one subject therein canvassed overrides all others, and his expose will be hailed with heartv annroval or simrrfcd with execration aa the reader substantially agrees with or diasents trom his judgment on tbis point. Essentially, the President sees and pro claims that Sliii'erti Aim liecomethe imoliica- blf foe of the American Union, nnd thnt tlte Slave l ower mutt die in ortler tniit tne Re public may live. Ane this is. so obviously, so glaringly true, that th historian will have difficulty in realizing that it was ever gravely disputed. It seems inoredible that human audacity should be equal to the task of misrepresen ting the President's position, "Is he not pledged to prosecute the war to the sole end of restoring the legitimate authority of the Constitution and Union?" Most certainly he is; and that is just what ho is doing. It is preoisely and only because the Slave Power is the chief, the fundamental obstacle to such restoration, that he is compelled to grupple with it in mortal encounter. It is Slavery nothing under heaven but Slavery that unites the lower counties of Mary land ves, and of Delaware also in bonds of lively sympathy with the Confederate traitors, while a great majority of the peo ple of those States, living unuursod by the daily clung of human fetters, aro and ever have been loyal. It is Slavery, and nothing else, that makes the Old Dominion a den of treus in, while Witt Virginia, on the con trary, having few slaves, is stunuhly loyal. It is Slavery whioh reverses the poles of Tennessee, making her Kastern division a oitadel of Unionism, while Middle and West Tennessee are cankered with treason. Sj in Missouri, every oounty wherein Slavery wn predo ninant has swarmed with gurrillus and -ent in y into toswli tho Ritui armies win e iis Krue-Liibor communities rally in stiiiutivtdy under the old flag. Hence, healthy amount of Unionism in Northern Alabama and Mississippi, but none is per ceptublo in Southern; hence Unionism struggling to thosurfuue in Western Texas, Imt oowed and dumb in Eastern; hence Unionism outspokeu in New-Orleans, Mem i ill is. Nashville, but none to SDeak of (among Whi'es) on the great plantations whnraby - tb,nae ouiee - aro stirrouuad.-r- Who can misread those undeniable facts? Were Slavery dead to day, we might to morrow mutter out of service every Union soldier, and still the Union would be oer tuinly and speedily restored. Leave Slav ery where this Rebellion found it, and you may kill and bury every man now in the Confederate armies, with every one who could be induced to serve in those armies, and still tho Uuion would soon bo again assailed, and must ultimately fall unless its mortal foe should be killed first. Secession is in the blood of the slaveholding caste, and will never be' expelled while Slavery remains. "Blmll uol the Mlf-ssme mnlil Frodiic Hie H'-miiih men!" Slavery has been thirty years reaching the conclusion that she is unequally and in juriously yoked with Free Labor in our Re public that her interests suffer, nnd mutt suffer, from the partnership. She has summoned all her resources for a life and death struggle she has violently severed the ligament that bound hor to tho Free States she may be temporarily coerced into submission, but never reconciled to lovaltv. Ihe South niuy easily here claim ed to sincere Unionism the Slave Power never oan be. io it, the Union must ever be a loathed memory, a symbol of humil iation ; while by the renovated South it will bechertshed as her beueooent deliverer from the hideous nightmare that so long tottered and paralyzed her. the union may r.nd will be saved ; the Slave Power might be : both together never can be. Whv is it that the ODDonents of the President's policy do not meet the real is sue, instead of inventing and interposing another ? He would gladly have restored tho Union as it was : but that was not pos sible, lie might as well be required now to fill a bushel basket with the dew of last Fourth-of- July morning. He oan only save the Union by throttling its ' arch-enemy ; and they who insist that he shall not do this, really desire that he should fail, let the country no to pieces, and trust to their future incantations to resurrect it from the witches caldron into which its mangled re mains will have be on oast. The question is not between saving the Union in one way and another, but between savins it in the practicable way pointed out by the Presi dent, or not saving it at all. He urges Emancipation that the Nation may be . saved : he does not and never did seek to divert the War for the Union into a War for Emancipation. He simply proposes to save the country by the shortest, easiest, surest way, and let slavery abide tne oou sequenous Winchester Surrendered to the Federal Troops-A Skirmish with the Rebel Cavalry.
