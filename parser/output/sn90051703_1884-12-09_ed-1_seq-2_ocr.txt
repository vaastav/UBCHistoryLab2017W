Ii- the papera are mi index to th sentiments of the people, Socorro i convulsed with joy over the incorpo ratio 1 1 decision of Judge Hell. Till', press of the southern part of the Territory speak most cheerin gly of the mineral out-put and prospects that section. New .Mexico will event ually he the greatest mineral produc ing state of the Union. What prominent Democrat (?) was it in Santa Fe who .said he would spend $1,500 to heat a certain Demo crat on the county ticket at the late election, because the latter had been a consistent opposer of the ring foi years ? Nl'-'VKR was man or official more universally and thoroughly despised than Axtell is in this community; in fact we might say the feeling is shared by nine-tenths of the people of the Territory certain lv where he and bis acts as judge arc known. A LADY of New Haven advertises for a husband, Offering her heart and $50,000 for the right article. Come west, dear holy, where you will find any quantity of noble, vigorous man hood suffering for just such a dicker. Heart not so essential as form and "figure" $50,000. A SPECIAL from Santa Fe ii, forms us of the burglary of the auditor's office Sunday night. As we predicted shortly after the election of Cleve land, tires, burglaries, etc., would be in order in public offices, and they have commenced iii .Santa Fe. Wt will have more to say of this tomor row. Nkah Simla Hita, Socorro county, siiys the Bullion, a prospector named Williams died the- other day from the effects of a bite inflicted by a skunk, The malady partakes of hydrophobia, the victim dying ;i most horrible dearth. This is the third instance we have heard of in the Territory within live years. IJkdri the head ol' "Th Reunited IT 1 ,1 ftl . i r nion win appear an article ironi Hon.

It will undoubtedly treat. of the result Of the late election, a viewed by the south and as affecting thai section politically and finan cially. 1 1 will he an Interesting paper CopYJNd our article of the othei morning, wherein we stutetl we had information from Wasnington to the effect lh.it Axtell wonlil he dismissed shortly, the Silver City South west Sentinel adds : We trust, Webb, that all this is true, ami iiiat the territory is to be re lieved of this incubus at last. If he goes, we wiM he ready to give you full credit lor the overthrow of the dema gogue. Fvks President Arthur is accused by some of the papers as being not much of a Republican, if Mr. Blaini represents the "grand old party," as its organs and leaders claim, there is certainly very littlo of the organisa tion left, and Ke OOUld blame no man, not even the president, from denying party fealty. When "Me and Jack" went down the Republican party was i ngulfed with lliein. It is stated that in the Cerrillos dis- trlol tWO-thirds of the present loca tions will he abandoned on the 1st of January. Mack Range, True, and why. Not because 1 1 1 tL leOtiOH is wanting in mineral, bul booause oi the outrageous decision of Axtell, that a patent issued on agri cultural land known to be mineral holds and the mineral passes with the patent a decision so ridiculous as to shame any one of less bra.rn impu dence and supreme VSttitjF than Ax tell. The mluen Of thai section as n elaSS are poor, not able, to cope with the Santa Fe gang backed by Axtell on the bench, hem e had rat her aban- Jon their claims- upon aomeof which i hooeansls of dollars and years el' toil mve been expended than wage this unequal legal warfare. Thus his asinine or vicious ruling in this case has cost Santa Fe county many valu able citizens and much wealth, de veloped and undeveloped. This pois onous human parasite, either as a eitiienoran official, paralyses every healthy, material interest and Indus try With which he conies in contact, and it is a matter of wonderment with all w hy the administration or the Al mighty permits him to afflict this ei an v other community. We freely give space to the follow ing card from Mr. Knaebel, concerning the land deal in which lie was sought to be defrauded out of his portion of the profits in the transaction. We were certainly informed that Max Frost had a "working" interest with fíov. Sheldon, hut would not even de him an injustice (there is enough against him that is true) in refusing to correct the impression ; while, as for Dr. Long well, knowing him to bl very avaricious we can still see how Sheldon might have imposed upon his confidence and informed him that the arrangement was perfec tly satis actory to Mr. Knaebel. At any rate, since Mr. Knaebel returned to Santa Fe he has probably become more fa miliar with the facts, and the follow ing is published in justice to all : Santa Fk, Dec. ti, 1S.S4. Editor Gazkttk : While deeming it improper to discuss In the news papers the merits of my equity suit now pending against (overnoi Shel don, I feel it my duty to inform you that in your recent article on the sub ject, you are in error in your reflect ions against Col. Max Frost, and in the statement that 1 aver that he and Dr. Longwell wore parties to the al leged fraud. So far as 1 am informed Gov. Sheldon is alone responsible for the attempt to exclude me from the benefits of a business transaction which originated with me and in which I considered him in good faith as my partner, Respectfully, Jno. H. Knai: ni:!. On yesterday morning's train, pro ceeding eastward, was ex-United States Surveyor General Atkinson. Il is possible he has been called to Washington for a sett lenient, as he has been reported behind as an official to the amount of several thousand dollars. He will not fly so high at the national capital as this time last year, when on for reappointment, nourishing recommendations from the gang at Santa Fc, hacked by Frost's laudatory editorials in the Review and Chairman of the Territo rial Republican Committee Hrceden's personal efforts. More of the crew will travel the same road, but nota few will switch ofr at Penitentiary villc. Though somewhat "independ ent" in our mode of worship we be lieve that is the fashionable thing In Las Vegas now we still have an abiding faith In the wisdom and power of an all wise being, and confidently look for matters to "even up" right rapidly in New Mexico. The Lord certainly made a good beginning in "downing" Blaine and Flkins. Grani county's hoard oi commie sioncrs have at last taken definite action looking to the collection of taxes from the Southern Pacific rail mad. Judge Bristol, about a year ago, it w ill he remembered, rendered a decision that under the six years exemption act of the legislature of 178, railroads constructed within the Territory after the passage oí said act could not be held liable for laxes during the time fixed for said exenip tion. This decision was affirmed by the supreme court of the Territory and there the matter has retted until recently. Grant's commissioners have determined to appeal to the su preme court of the United States and have placed the management of the ease in the hands of Mr. S. M. Ashen felter. The progress of the suit will he watched with no little interest, as its final determination will materially interest all roads now operating in .New Mexico. Mr. Ashenfelter is to be congratulated upon the compli ment paid him by his selection as at torney in so important a suit. Tin: live stock feature of the New Orleans exposition will be on a scale ef grandure and liberality that char acterises other departments of this world's fair. Forty-two thousand dollars have been set apart as premi ums for live stock, divided as follows: Horses, $12,000; breeding and dairy cattle, $li,000 fat stock (cattle, sheep ad hogs), 1(),(HHI, sheep 5,600; hogs, $','A); poultry and pet stock ró.miO, and dogS MM0, This liberality in premiums ought to and will make the live stock department a very at tractive feature of the show.
