At rai MiBTtito of the Judiciary Com mittee of tbe llonee of jepreientatlrei. yesterday, a bill to repel tba tennre of ofllco act was nnantmouily screed npoo. aad wt'il be reported early next week. Tbe Imprg. slon seems to be that the liouie wltl puis tbe bill, bat It Is much mora doabltyl la tbe Senate, notwithstanding the President's re commendation. Bali op Quakteruastik's Storis. An extensive sale took place a few days since at Armory sqnare, under the direction of Capt. V. O. Thorn,... military etorekoeperi 83,000 knit shirts being disposed of, at an average price or 30 cents apiece. A large lot of con demned stores, eonslsttog of old harness, Umber, Ac., was also sold, tbe former being disposed of at very small prices, and the latter at an average of 3 . cents per foot. It axsweb to an Inquiry from an asses sor, Commissioner DeUoo says that distillers and brewers can sell at place of mannfactnro so long as they sell la original casks or packages, to which tha tax stamps are af fixed, without payment of tax as liquor dealers, bat there le no other provision at lowing such, exemption. A rectifier of his distilled product cannot sell without paying tax as a liquor dealer. Till fbibsjis of tbe lata Sonator Keiicu den have Indicated tbe names of the Sen ators whom they desire should deliver eulo gies, and the order la which they should speak, aa follows i Morrill, of Malae, to an noaoce tbe death of tho Senator, to be fol lowed by Morrill, of Vermont, Anthooy, Trumbull, Williams, Howard, and Davis. In tbo House tha death wilt bo announced by Mr. Peters, of Maine. SscnzTABY Fish and Mrs. Fish gave their first public reception last night, tbe Invita tions being by card. There was a large and brilliant company. Including Assistant Sec reUry of State Davis, aevoral prominent officers of the army and navy, Senators In Coogress, foreign utuiet-wa ana tbelr wives, and Secretaries Bonfirell. Belknap and Post master General Creawell, General Horace Porter, and numerous strangers la Washing ton. The ladles' toilettes were brilliant, aod fashion had a. fair display. It was a pleas ant occasion. Tai srsTEir or sioxALixa Invented by General Myers, and Introduced by blm Into tbe army, was found eo servlccable-dorlng tbe war that It has since been made a part of tbe Instruction of cadets and midship men. The same signal service by flags during tbe day and by torches at night Is nsed by both services with dohers for eecrot communication between tbe two. There Is also a field telegraphlo drill, with trains which carry every appliance for erectlog portable Unas of telegraph at the rate of three miles an hour, and then working It. A vert modest bill was that Introduced la tbe Home yesterday by Mr. Wells, of Missouri, " Donating to tbe city of St. Louis for a i-rk, the land oa which tbe United States arsenal now staods." The bill con templates that the Government shall grant, relinquish and convey this laud la feo simple to the city, for a park forever, and, In con sideration of this grant of the Government, tbe city Is to erect on tho proposed park a monument to tbe officers and soldiers of the United Statce who fell In the late war WbethV this statue Is to be made of clay or gold. Is not specified. If St. Louis Is to have the capital, tbey should at least give some security that the monument fbould be a re spectable one. Retoimchuejct CoUafiTTBB. The .Re trenchment Committee Is not likely to re port on its summer examination till after the holiday recess. Their Inquiries resulted in a recommendation to Secretary Boutwell which he at once adopted. They foundtbat great frauds were undoubtedly being com mitted oa the shipment of goods from .New Tork to San Francisco, by way of tbe Isth mus, through the regulations respecting seals used on packages, and Senator Tatter son, for the committee, advised new regula tions of entirely different characters from those la force, aad these were at onco drawn up and have quite recently been promul gated. They will withdraw great tempta tions and unquestionably result In consider able saving to tbe Government. Tub House Committee on Indian Affairs hare ascertained that in almost every in stAnao where treaties are made with the In dians, not only the Government but tho In dians are outrageously swindled by tbe officers making the treaties and controlling the disbursements of money under them A bill In view of these facts will be reported by the chairman, prohibiting tbe making of treaties In the usual manner la tbe future. Tbo committee believe that many of tbo trea ties now In operation are Improper, and tbey will endeavor to havo the Secretary of tbo Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs authorized to annul as many of the existing treaties as practicable. It Is proposed that Congress take the matter la hand, and pro vide for the maintenance of the various In dian tribes. Tub Mohxx Order 8tbtim as a Pehsion Aoest. Theeuccese whlcn has attonded tbe use of the mooeyordor system of tbo Tost Office Department in the remittance of money for tbe payment of fees to the Patent Office has naturally led to tho Inquiry why tbo syttera is not equally applicable la tbe remittance of small amounts by the Govern meat to its creditors. It has been urged that tbe system is peculiarly applicable to tbe payment of pensions to invalid soldiers, widows, orphans, Ac , as tbo payment being made In tbe 'Immediate vicinity of the resi dence of tbe pensioner, thero would bo far less opportunity for frauds, more certainty of tbe identity of the Individual, and less risk of the Government being Imposed upon by false Impersonations of the death of tbo real pensioner. It would also render wholly practicable more frequent payments, which 

WASHINGTON.' D. 0., SATCRDYDEOEML'aBft are very deslrablsj and It would save to tho Government the quarter of a million of dol lars now paid aa salary and expenses to the agents of the bureau. It Is sUUd that Gen eral Botler, Mr. Orth and others warmly favor an adoption of the plan, and that the former gentlemaa will, In a day or two, In troduce a bill for that purpose. The Wexklt ItsruBLicAK for this week Is jnst the paper to aaadto your friends. It contains the reports of the Comptroller of the Currency, Commissioner of Intersil Rsvenne, Secretary of tbe Interior and Post master General. Also a full report of the National Labor Convention, Including the address on tbe Itelatlons of tbe Colored Peo ple to American Industry, and the report of the Committee on Platform.

ALIKVATB TlTLC TO ClTT REAL pRorERTT. In July, 1805, the Military Mayor and municipal authorities of tbe city of New Orleans leased certain wharves and piers to tbe New York Mall Steamship Com pany for the term often years, at a rental of $8,000 per annnm, payable lu monthly In stalments, with the privilege of erecting such buildings, Ac., as should be necessary la re spect of their business. Upon the reinstate ment of tbe civil city government an ordi nance was passed, in April, 1800, repudiat ing tbo lease held by tbe steamship com pany, and directing the city surveyor to re move the building which had been erected oa tho leased property) and under that au thority tho Improvements were demolished. Oo the day of this proceeding tbe steamship cqmpany commenced this suit In the United States Circuit Court to restrain tbe city gov ernment from any further acts hostile to their uso and possession under tbe lease; and tho Injunction was granted. Imme diately after the city commenced suit la tbo State Court to reitrala the company from further use and occupancy, aad from the further erection of bulldlegs, Ac, on tbe property) and thereupon tho company filed a supplemental petition, setting forth tho ac tion of the city la instituting suit, and pray ing an Injunction restraining further pro ceedings therein, and the commencement of any similar action. Tbo Injunction was granted, and also an order directing tbe city to discontinue their suit, or to show causo why proceedings should not bo had as for a contempt. Tbe mayor filed a sworn answer to this motion, disowning any Intention to disregard tho injunction order of the Circuit Court previously Issued, and jtt ting that the order was served oa blm alter tbe building had been removed; also setting forth that the ob ject of the suit commenced by the city was to prevent any further erection or build ings by the company, and to preserve gener ally tho ifafu ijuo of affairs. His answer on tbo merits, subsequently filed, denied tbe authority of tbe military mayor and authori ties to bind, Incumber, or allenafti the real property of tho city beyond tbo period of tbelr official existence, and claiming that all the acts done by them ceasod to be of any force and effect unou tho restoration of tho government of tho city to the muntclpal authorities elected under tbo laws of tbe State. It vtas alleged further that tbe lease was void becuuio none of the formalities prescribed by law and tbe ordinances of tbe city had been compiled with. A supple mental answer prayed that the lease "might bo annulled and set aside. Upon tbe trUl tbo Judgment sustained tho lease, and In junction was issued restraining tho city from further luterferenco with tho rights of tbo company, under It, during Its term. From that Judgment appeal was taken to tbo L lil ted States Supremo Court, and the causo now comes on to bo heard. The court suggested that the Jurisdiction failed, the case having been brought up by writ of error Instead of appeal. The casa was dismissed. L. Janln and . A.
