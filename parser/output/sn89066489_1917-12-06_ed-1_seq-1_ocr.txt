VOL. XL. BUTLER, vi SOURl. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1917. NUMBh 8 CONGRESS IN SESSION Sentiment Favors Declaring War on Enemy Aliens. ' Washington, Dec. 3. War atmos phere pervaded the Capitol today when the second session of the sixty-fifth Congress the war Congress opened at noon. In Senate and House the uppermost thought was the vigorous carrying on of the war with all the legislative force Congress can give it. On both sides of the Capitol the prospect of an early declaration of war against Austro-Hungary and the other Allies of Germany, so as to make a clear-cut issue with the Cen tral Powers, was bruited. Democrat ic and Republican leaders, united in favoring quick action by Congress that would align Germany's allies as enemies of the United States. Congress did no legislative work on .its first day. After the usual per functory preliminaries, committees were appointed by Vice President Marshall and Speaker Clark to in form the President Confess had come together and would await his message. This the President will de liver in person at 12:30 o clock to morrow. , The Senate session lasted exactly 14 minutes, adjournment being taken then on motion of Senator La Fol lette, out of respect to the memory of Senator Husting, who was killed in a hunting accident six weeks ago. The House took a recess for half an hour Soon after getting together, so that the joint committee might-1 fonnally notify the President. Upon the re turn of the House committee, the House adjourned until tomorrow. . Of the 67 Senators present, not one ..- appeared to have any definite idea as to the war program Congress is to undertake. Democrats and Repub licans alike said there would be no coherent idea for legislative work un til the President's message had been delivered. Everywhere the opinion was expressed that Congress would attack the war problems with tbe one aim in view to win the war. Huge war schemes, involving the expendi ture of billions of dollars, will be taken up with this spirit predomi ' nant.. i That a strong sentiment exists in Conn-ess for -a declaration of war ' against Germany's allies was evident in talks with , various benators. Three outstanding reasons were ad vanced for this: 1. A-general sentiment throughout the country to carry on bitter war fare against Germany and the coun tries fighting with it, so as to make war against the common enemy. 2. It would afford the means of classifying as enemy aliens the sub jects of not only Germany, but its al lies and in that way enable the Gov ernment to protect itself against se cret spies. 3. Unity of action in the Interal lied Conference now tn progress in Paris. Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was outspoken in favoring a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria.
