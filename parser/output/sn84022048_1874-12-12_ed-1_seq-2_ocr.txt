THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE!. Tbongh oar telegrams remained ob stinately mate reapeeting the eontenta of the President' message, we last night received a copy in one of our exchanges, and in another column publish a brie! synopsis of lha subject discussed in that document. It appears to be a plain business-like statement of the condition of the national - affairs, which,, though length; bom the importance ol the mat ters referred to, is a very interesting snd readable document. The President takes strong gronnds on the resumption of specie payments, and very truly ssvs, that the matter may be put off, bat that such procrastination ia not only crim inal but useless, for the day will come when a return to cash payments must be made, simply because from th de cline of national and individual credit nothing else will b taken in tha liquid' ation of all obligations, whether public or private. Tha faot is, that the Frew- dent had to accept the formula of the lamented. Greeley, and in effect says, though he does sot use the words of his I great rival: "That the way to resume is to resume." Daring the last Presi dential campaign, the great Journalist was hooted by his enemies for his lack of financial ability, and those wiseacres said that if he were elected that national bankruptcy would follow. Now we see, that In two short years, bis competitor is recommending the very conrse that Greeley advised. But no matter where it comes. or from whom, specie payments are daily becoming more and more a necessi ty , and the President shows his good sense and foresight in sdvising that immediate steps be taken to provide for the change. On the condition of the (Southern States the President does not take so satisfacto ry a position, though his remarks appear candid, with au evident endeavor to look at those embarrassing questions coolly and fairly without reference to party bias. In this tha President's observa tions appear In favorable contrast with most of the officials and politicians who support those villainous carpet baggers. The former sction of the President in tne Louisiana ense is what troubles him and though he persistently defends hii action, it is easy to sea that if he had ths matter to manage over again, he would never have taksn the coarse he did. The President then takes up the subject of foreign relations and makes a very satis factory showing. In discussing the tariff he appears to visibly lean to the side of one for revenue and not for pro tection. Referring to the Indian affairs, he says that the policy has been success ful. We suppose be meant successful in causing the massacre of the settlers and letting the murderers Joff soot free, we know of nothing else in which it has been successful. The President also ad vocates the establishment of liberally paid lines of mail steamers and other means for the revival of American com merce. Taking the messsge as a whole, though totally void of all pretentious language or hifalutin, and having but few merits as a literary production, still it is very creditable to its author, and shows that after all, he does think about something else besides smoking cigars, trotting horses and receiving gifts. Ts Chicago Tribune, now edited by MerjJill, aays: The return of tha Democratio part to the control of th Government will ne cessarily involve th pecuniary recogni tion oi the rebellion, th complete com pensation oi th people ol the Bonmern States for all their losses and damages caused by th Union armies, th assump tion of the rebel States debts, and such a general accumulation of debt as will double th taxes and mortgage the Unit ad States for ths next two eeoturie. To all of which it may be safely re plied, that if any inch idiotic folly is at tempted by th Democratio or any other party, that its leas of power will b so remarkably short that they will b out before they well know that they are in. Ix the German Bsichstag Prince Bis marck makes us of th following re markable language as to ths osusos that precipitated the Franco-German war: I am in possession of conclusive evi dence that the (Ecumenical Council was cut short on account of the Franco-German war. It would have been vary dif ferent had the French been victorious, I know from th very best sources that Nanoleon was d reeded into th war. very much against his will, by Jesuitical in fluence. At the eleventh hour he de termined on peace, and kept his resolu tion half an hour. Ultimately he was overpowered by persons representing the Vatican. j Yf gather from our telegrams pub lished this morning that the Proctor. Houlton libel suit has been compromised. It is further said that Beecber is very in dignant that he did not have an oppor tunity to testify. That is too thin. We have no idea that the man wants to go near th witness box, and if be does, it will be very little consequence, for under existing circumstances he could expect no on but his deluded congregation to give any credence to his testimony. In Washington it has been decided by s full bench of judges, that the grand jury who indicted the safe burglars were illegally chosen, consequently the indict ments against Harrington and Whitely are nullities. Wa thought so. It will be as difficult to punish th criminals in that shameful business as it would be to set fire to a block of ioe. 

XLIII CONG BESS. ITI. Dec. Bill intro- ' Anothkb railroad robbery has oc curred. This time it was at a place called Muncie, in Kansas, where th ex press car was entered and Wells-Fargo's safe robbed ot 927,000 in dust, coin and greenbacks. The Governor of Kansas offers a reward of $2,000, the Railroad Company $5,000, and Wells, Fargo & Co. $10,000, for the robbers. Thr New York Court of Appeals, reversed the ruling of the lower court refusing the motion made by Beecber'S counsel for a bill of particulars. The defendants in that suit never intend that it shall come to trial if they can help it. Jonathan Stcbobs, one of the oldest, best known and most respeoted of New Tork merchants, died last week at the ripe old a&e of seventy-three. For forty years he had been a leading member of the merchants of New York. HoroUTON, who pretends to represent California in Congress, but is nothing more or less than a Congressional rail road attorney, is about to introduce a bill to extend Government aid to the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Cen tral Pacific has already got its claws Into th Southern Pacifio and wants another road to be built by the people's money and then presented to the company, whioh would immediately consolidate with the Central Pacifio, and then there would be another instance, of tha people being robbed and deprived of that prop er competition which is the only means of keeping these monster corporations in anything like decent behavior. The scheme very plainly shows the ear-marks of that precious institution, the Contract and Finanoe Company of the Central Pacific. Tan earthquake throughout Mexico was much more severe than at first re ported. A great many buildings were destroyed and lives lost. At Vera Cruz much damage was done as well as in the interior. . Carl Schtjbz recently cave a lecture st Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in which he advocated the addition of art culture to the course of training adopted in the public schools of the country.

Houiihton. from the Committee on the Pacific Railroad, reported a bill pro viding that the railroad bridge of Omaha and its arjoroaches on each side of the river shall be operated as a part of the continuous line ol the Union Pacifio Railroad, and requiring half yearly re ports of the monthly receipts of the tolls and charges or tne onage to oe made, Houghton was pretty thoroughly cross questioned as to the intent and effect of tne bill, ana bis explanations lasted till the close of the morning hour, when the bill went over. Bills introduced: By McCrary to ex tinguisb the Indian title to the Black Hills reservation. Bv Holman. to substitute United States notes for issues of the National banks. Bv Beck, to prohibit Senators, Repre sentatives and Delegates in Congress from acting as counsel or otherwise in suits or proceedings against the United States. On motion of Rand ill, there being no objection, the House proceeded to the consideration of the bill, and after the adoption of an amendment omitting from the penalty a provision disqualifying offenders from holding office, it passed without objeotion. Cronnse introduced a bill tor addition al representation from Nebraska. By . 11. nooeris, proposing an amendment to the Constitution providing that Congress shall not make anything but gold and silver a legal tender. By Mernam, for tree banking. By Page, for inquiry into the Coolie traffic. By Randall, repealing th increase of tbe President's salary. The House went into committee of the whole on general calendar, and took up Kelly s bill for tbe exchange of green backs into 3.05 convertible bonds, and Kelly addressed the House at length on favor of the bill, and was followed by Butler in support of the bill. During his remarks he said the Republican party was held responsible for the distress that had been brought upon the conntry; when the war olosed bsd a party at the head of which were capitalists and at the foot negroes, with not much affilia tion between them. Laughter on tbe Democratio aide. Butler remarked that their was no occasion for their laughter; the Democratic party bad old big bond holders for its bead and Irishmen for its tail, snd there was very little affiliation between them. kiwi mr maUm Curat)!!. Wy., Dec. 3. Professor O. C. Marh and bia seientin party arrived here laat evening from tne "bad lands south of th Black Hills.

Th latter stopped th party twice when on their wsy to th "bad lands," attempted a night attack on their camp, and other wise molested them.- the explorations were made under great difficulties, but resulted in important discoveries. About two tons of th remains of extinct tropi cal animala were collected, among tbem many new to science. This collection goea to Yale College and will soon be described by Professor Uarsh.

Jcst as we thought, the riots at Yicks burg had been precipitated by the oarpet baggers and negroes. It appears that ths sheriff was soting without bonds, the supervisors would not take any action in the matter and the usual amount of ras cality was at work. ' Both parties be came inflamed, tha negroes marched on Vicksburg, tbe whites resisted and the trouble commenced. That is tbe whole affair in a nut shell. A tebeible inundation occurred at St. Petersburg, caused by a remarkably high tide, which rose nine feet above its ordinary level. A number of the poorer inhabitants have been driven from their homes and are being provided for at the publio expense.
