Tlio Usual Annual Itnlew of 1 ho AfTiihx T t ho Country, With a Discussion of the Now TarllF, and a Strong Plea In Behalf of Free and lion est Elections. The 5tst Congress reflsseinbletl on Xton- day for Its short or clotting Hussion, and has a large attendance in both hrauches. Af ter the transaction of preliminary liusiness a committee was ajipointed to wait upon the I'leniilent and inform him that Con gress wuh In sesHlon ami ready tu receive utiy coiiuimtiication that tie might have to make. In reunse the annual iiieNsage 1 was sent in and duly read. The document opens Willi tlie customary alluninii tu tlie orderly und peaceful way in uhich the af fairs of the government have been con ducted dunntr tlio tiast year. Then follows the usual (Ji8Cussionof our foreign relation! with tegard to wliuh tlieie is nothing of especial liitetest or importance. It it stated that the Nicaragua canal piuject, uudur the control uf Auiericuu ciliens. H inak lug uooil ptoKress, and tlmt all the nrelim- iimi ) opeiutiouo have been c uupleteil wTtfi lu the piescilbed time. t,'ongi atul ittous are ex preset d over the coi dial relation?' which exist helweeii thii countrv and our sister republics uf Kianre and AlfXK'ti. Proceed lug to our liuaitcial interests it is stated that the revenues ol the govern ment from nil soutces for the llcil year ending June ;10, Ism I, were $lti:I,U(M.lJ4U - )), and the total expenditure lor theaiue period are $;S5S,OI4t5S4.5J The surplus tor the year, including the amount applied to the sinking fund, was ilO."i,:mil!m.0:t llie receipU for l!til weie MfMMO .1U:I.7U, ami the expenditures 15,?;i'd,S71 in exrem of those of lMg'J, The cuftioms receipts in creased yd.i.yi'J.bH, ami the receipts from internal revenue $U,i,r.ll q'.I, while on the side of expenditures, that for peuriiuii was lll.llliJT.'i il(J in excettof tliepreceil iug year. lit alluding to the new law for the in creased coiuiifu of silver the President notes with i egret the fact that It has not nad the anticipated elTect in enhancing the price of silver, but that on the contrary Iheieliah lecently lieen u mai ked deidiue hi its price. There has leeti a coiisnlera ble increase in the amount of silver which, tlie government has been able to get into cliculatiou. dt will require seveial uioutliH )et to determine what will be tlfu perma nent t-fTert of the recent silver legitlatiou I he tr (Torts of the secretary of ttie treut- I ury tu increase the volume of money in j circulation by keeping down tie treasur j jturplus to the loweht practical limit, have been unremitting and in u very htgli de gree successful. Tables presented hy him. i show ing tlie increase of u.u ey in circulation I durimr the last two decades, and espei'iall) j the tat le showing the iiicreasedurmg the 111 month he haw administered the aHairs ol ' thedepirtineut.ure inteieftiuguud instruct ive Ihe 1'reHitent notices with greul pleasure tlie statement of the secietar) that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal ear nearly $12,(MJ!,0m thit the cost of col lecting this larger revenue was less by $110, (UT than for the same purine in the pre celling )ear. The percentage of cte-t of collecting tlie customs revenue was less fur the last liscal year than ever Iwfure. Ilrief allusions are made to the various department rejiorts, ami the statement is made that every jwHsitile elTort has been used to exjteflite business under the new disability pension act The expenditure under this new law- will not. It is believed, exceed the ehtimates made before its enact uieut. This liberal enlargement of th law should suggest a more careful tcrutin of bills for secial relief loth ns to the cases where relief is granted and as to the amount allowed. The increasing numbers and influence of the lion-Mormon opulaliou in I tali are observed w it h sat il net ion Allusion i made to 1'iesidetit Woo-lrull' deliverance advising the Mormons to refrain fiom con trading plural mai riages, hut attention ts called tu the fact lhal he does not reimunce ihedoctiine of oi)gamv, but simply re fraius from teaching it because the law i against it. On this point Mr. Harrison forcibly sas- Now, it is quite true tint the law should not attempt to ileal w ith the faith or belief of any one . but it i ijuite another thing, and the only safe thing, sn to ileal w ith the territory of Utah as that those who believe iolvgamy to te rightful shall not have the pow er to make it law ful, Pftx'eedmg to the atfairs of the depart ment of agriculture the message says it will be foil d that the efforts of the depart ment have been intelligently nud zealously j devoted to the promotion of the interests intrusted to its care A very substantial improvement in the market prices of the leading products during the year is noticed The price of w beat advanced from 1 cents in October, lbMI, to$l.U0J in October, Corn from Jll cents tu 50 cents , oats from 111 cents to 4It cents, and barley from 'id cents to 78 cents. .Meats showed ii sub stantial but not so large an increase. The export trade in h e animals and fowls shows a very large increase The total value of such exjiorts for the vear ending June HO, 1 s'.'i, was $:l:l,lMXJ,0(K),"and the in crease over the preceding year was over lo.lHHI.lHH). Nearly 'ilXl.WX) more cuttle and over 45, (MM) more hogs were exerted than in the preceding year. The expoit trade in beef and nnk products ami in dairy products was very largely increased, the increase in the article of butter atone be ing from I5,501('.ti4 jHiunds to J,74S.(48 pounds and the total increase in the value of meat and dairy products exported be ing $;J4,(M)tll0a This trade so directly helpful to the farmer it is believed will be yet further and very largely increased when the system of inspection and sanita ry supervision now provided by law is brought fully into operation. The law relating to the civil service has been executed by those having the power of opH)intment in the classified service with fidelity and impartiality and the ser vice lias been incieaMitKly hatufactory The report of the commission shows a large amount of gitod work during the ear with very limited appropriations. President Harruon congratulates Con gress und the country upon the passage at the first session of the 51st Congress of au unusual number of laws of very hinh im 10 tance That the result of this legisli lion will be the ijuickeniner and enlarge ment of our manufacturing industries, larger und better markets for our bread- Imparts Healthfulness to the Bread. The Royal Baking Powder possesses a peculiar quality, nf possessed by any other leavening agent. It provides bread, biscuit, cake, muffins or rolls which may be eaten when hot without inconvenience by persons of the most delicate digestive organs. Yeast, and all baking powders that produce the leavening gas by fermentation, as is well known, destroy a portion of the nutritive elements of the flour, and particularly those which are the most healthful and the greatest aids to a perfect assimilation of the food. With most persons it is necessary that bread raised with yeast should lose its freshness or become stale before it can be eaten with safety. The same distressing results follow from eating biscuit, cake, pastry, etc, raised by the cheap, inferior baking powders that contain lime, alum, phosphates or other adulterants. The Royal Baking Powder leavens the food most perfectly by purely mechanical means without changing or impairing any ci tlie elements of the flour. Thus the hot roll and muffin and tho delicious hci griddle-cakes raised by the Royal Baking Powdei are made as wholesome and digestible as warm soup, meat or any other food. I stuffs nnd provisions both at home ami abroad, more constant employment and better wages for our working people, and an increased supply of a safe currencv for the transaction of business tlie President lias no doubt The general trade and In dustrial conditions throughout the country during the year have shown a marked ini provetnent. For many years jirior to lbXS the merchandise balances of foreign trade had been largely in our favor, but during that year and the year following they turned against us, It Is very gratifying to know that the last fiscal year atfain shows a balance in our favor of over 

0S.0O0.(KK), The figures show that an increase in the volume of business was very general throughout the country That this larger business was being conducted upon a safe and profitable basis is shown by the fact that there were itOO less failures reported in October, IH'JO, than in the same month of the preceding year, with liabilities dimin ished by about 5,000,X)0. The value of exports of lnmestic merchan tis-f during the last year was over Jl 15,000((XK) greater than the preceding year and was inly ex ceeded once in our history. About $HH), 000,000 of this excess w as in agricultural products The production of pig iron ul wojs a good trautfe of general prnterity is shown by a recent census bulletin to have been &VI per cent greater in I Sill) than In ltWU, and the production of steel 2110 per cent greater. Thr New Tarlfr Mm. Prom this point the President proceeds to the discussion of the new tariff law and its probable cHct upon the business of the country. This is the etseutial part of the message and we quote in full : "The apprehension that our tariff may again and at once he subjected tr import ant general changes would undoubtedly add a depressing itilluence of the most se rious character. The general tariff act has only partially ifmie into operation, some of Us important provisions being limited to take effect at dates yet in the futured. The general provisions of the law have been in force less than 00 days Its permanent effects upon trade and prices ure still largely conjecture It is curious to note that the advance, tu the prices of atcl'S w holly unaffected by the tariff act was by many hastily ascribed to that act Notice was not taken of the fact that the general tendency of the mai kets was up ward from influences wholly apart from the recent tariff legislation The enlarge ment of our currency by the silver bill un doubtedly gave an upward tendency tit trade and had a market effect upon puces b it this natural effect of tlie silver legisla tion was hy ninny erroneously attributed to the tariff act There is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject of tariff re vision shall be again opened before this law has had u fair trial. It is quite true that every taritl schedule is subject to ob jections. No bill was ever framed, I sup pose, that in all of it rates and classifieu tions had the full approval even of a pirtv caucus Such legislation is always and necessarily the product of compromise ms tu details, mid the pfeeut law is no excep Hon Hut in its general scope and effect I think it will justify the support of those who believe that American leLridutiu should consei v e and defend Aiuei ican trade and the wages of American work men. The misinformation as to the terms uf the act which has been so widely di semiuated at home and abrojtl will be cor rected by experience and the evil auguries as to its results confounded by the market reports, the savings banks, international trade balance, and the general prosperity of our people. Already we begin tu hear from abroad and from our custom houses that the prohibitory effect upon imjMjrta tions imputed tu the act is nut justified The imjiorts at the port of New York for the first three weeks of November were nearly S per cent greater thau for the same pen d in Ihfilt. and 20 per cent greater thau hi the same iieriod uf Aud so far from beiug an act to limit exorts I confidently believe that under it we shall secure a larger and more profitable partici pation in foreign trade thau we have ever enjojed, ami that we shall recover a pro portionate participation m the ocean carry ing trade of tlio world. " The criticisms ol the lull that have come to us from foreuu sources may be well re jected for repugnancy If these critics really believe that the adoption by us of free trade or of tariff rates having refer ence solely tu revenue would dimmish the participation of their own countries tu th commerce of the world, their advocacy and promotion hy speech and other forms of organized effort, of this movement ainotnr our people is a rare exhibition of unselfish ness, and on the other hand, if they sin cerely believe that the adoption of a pro tective tat ill W)licy by this country inures to their profit and our hurt, it is noticeably strange that they should lead the outcry against the authors of a jtolicy so helpful to their countrymen, and crown with their favor those who would snatch from them a substantial shate of a trade withother laud already inadequate to their necessities 'There is no disMsition among any of our people to promote prohibitory or retaliatory legislation Our jiohcies ure adopted not to the hurt of others but to secure for our selves those advantages that fairly grow out uf our favored position as a nation. Our form of government, with its incident nf universal suffrage, makes it imperative that we shall save our working people from the agitations aud distresses which scant work and wages that have uo margin for comfort always beget Put after all this is done it will be found that our mar kets are open to friendly commercial ex changes nt enormous value to the other great powers. "From the time of my induction into of lice the duty of using every power and in tluence given by law to the executive de partment for the development of larger markets for our products, especially our farm products, has been kept constantly in mind, and no effort has been or will be spared to promote that end. We are under no disadvantage in any foreign market, except that we pay our workmen better wages thau are paid elsewhere better ab stractly, better relatively, to the cost of the necessities of life. I do uot d )ubt that a very largely increased foreign trade is accessible to us without bartering for it either our home uiaikei for such products of the farm and shop as nur own people can I supply or the wages of our working people , In many of the products of wood ami iron ' and in meats and b refldstulTs we have atl vantages that only need better facilities of intercourse and transportation to secure for theni large foreign markets, The reci procity clause of this tariff act wisely and effectively opens the way to secure a large reciprocal trade iu exchange for the free admisoion to our ports of certain profits. "The right of independent nations to make p?cial reciprocal trade concessions is well established aud does not impair either the comity due to other powein, or what is known as th "fuvnred-iifitlon clause," so generally- found in commercial treaties, what is given to one for an adequate agreed consideration cannot be claimed by another freely. The state of the revenues was such that we could dispense with any import duties Umhi coffee, tea. hides and the lower grades of sugar and molasses. That the large advantage resulting to the countries producing ami exporting these articles by placing tliem on the free list en titled us to expect a fair return in the way of customs concessions ujhjii articles ex iHtrted by us to them, was so obvious that to have gratuitously abandoned thin opportu nity to enlarge our trade would have been an error There were Imt two methods of maintaining control of this question open to Congress To place all of these articles UKin the dutiable list subject to such treaty agreements as could be secured, or to place them nil presently uftun the free list, but subject tu the leinqMwitiou of specified du ties if the countries from which we roceiv ed them should refuse to give tons suitable reciprocal benefits. This latter method, I think, prossegspR great advantages It ex presses in advance the consent of Congress to reciprocity arrangements affecting these products, which must otherwise have been delayed and unascertained until each treaty was ratified by the senate and the necessa ry legislation enacted by Congress 'Kxperience has shown that some trea ties looking to reciprocal trade have failed to secure a two-thirds vote in the senate for ratification, and others having passed that stage, have for years awaited the con currence of the house and senate in such umdifications of our revenue laws as were I necessary to give effect to their provisions. We now have the concurrence of Itoth houses in advance in a distinct and defi nite off-'r of free entry to our sirts of specific articles The executive is not re quired to deal in conjecture as Uj what Con gress will accept. Indeed, this reciprocity provision is more than an offer. Our part of the bargain is complete . delivery has been made, nnd when the countries from which we receive sugar, coffee, tea und hides have ! pla'-ed on their free lists such of our pro j ducts as shall be agreed uou as an equiva ' lent for our concession, a proclamation of that fact completes the transaction, and in the meantime our own people have free sugar, tea, coffee and hides. "The indications thus far given are very hopeful of early and favorable action by the countries from which we receive our large inqiorts of coffee and sugar, and it is 'oiifidently believed that if team commu nication with lhes countries can be prompt ly improved and enlarged, the next year will show a most gratifying increar.e iu our exports of breadstuffs and provisions as well as of some iitqiortunt lines of manu factured goods " Havitu: thus candidly and fully discussed the tariff question, the President reminds Congress that many important measures await its attention, and that to properly consider and act Uniu them will require all the time which is available before the end of the session as fixed bv law He stroni;- ly urges the encouragement und develop ment of steamship lines, and through them I of our trade with other c luutues, by every legitimate means lie endorses the propo J sition of the Pan American Congress for the establishment of uu international Amer ' lean bank, to facilitate money exchauges between the nations of North aud South ! America represented iu it The enactment of suitable bankrupt aud copyright laws is recommended The President also urges anew a subject on which he s(wjke strongly iu his message of last year the enactment of legislation to compel uuiformity iu the use of safety freight car couplers in order to put an end to the frightful stciifice of life and limb which goes on year after year under the present system a sacrifice w Inch amounts to 2000 lives and 20,000 young men maimed annually Some action by Congress is recommended to prevent the control of the water supply of the arid regions of the far West from falling into the hands of individuals or monos)lies which will have the pow er, if unrestrained, to make those who occupy these lauds entirely subservient to their will und dictation. With regard to the question of postal telegraphy, iu which Postmaster-General Wuiiamaker is a strung believer, the Presi dent says he sees no reason w hy th govern ment should own the telegraph hues any more than the railroads; but it does seem to him quite practicable for the government to contract with the telegraph companies, us it does with the railroad companies, to carry at specified rates such communica tions as the senders may derdgnate for this method of transmission, and he recom mends that such legislation le enacted as will enable the post-otlice department fairly to test by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph. Fire uuil lloticM Illrriioiia. The message closes with au outspoken discussion of the vital question of a free vote and an honest count in national elec tions, and this we quote in full : 'lf any intelligent and loyal company of Ameiican citizens were required to cata Ijgue essential human conditions of nation al life, 1 do not doubt that with absolute uuauiiuity they would begin with 'Free and hone-, t elections.' And it is gratifying to know that generally there is u grow nig and non-partisan demand fur better election laws. Hut against this sign of hope and progress must le set the depressing and un deniable fuct that election laws and meth ods are sometimes cunningly contrived to secure minority control, while violence completes the shortcomings of fraud. In my last unuual me-suge I suggested that the development of the existing law pro viding a Federal supervision of congres sional elections offered an effective met hoi 1 of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law has manifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesome re straints and penalties w ill be useful in all. The constitutionality of such legislation has been allirmed by the supreme courts. Its probable effectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is made to it. tt has been denounced as if it were a new exercise of Federal power and an in vasion of the rights of the states Nothing could be further from the truth. "Congress has. already fixed the time fur the election of members of Congress, It has declared that votes for members of Con gress must be by written or printed Iwllot; it has provided for the appointment by the circuit courts in certain cases, and upon the petition of a certain number of citizens of election supervisors, and made it their duty to supervise the legistratiou of voters con ducted by the state oflicers, to challenge persons offering to register, to personally inspect ami scrutinize the registry lists aud to affix their Hames to the lists for the pur pose of ideutifi 'ation and the prevention of frauds, to attend ut election aud remaiu w ith the boxes till the votes are all cast and counted ; to attach tu the registry lists and election returns any statement touching the accuiacy and fairness of the registry and election, and to take and transmit to the clerk of the house of representatives any evidence of fraudulent practices w hich may be presented to them. The same law pro vides for the appointment of deputy United States mar&halls to attend at the j tolls, sup port the supervisors iu the discharge of their duties, and to arrest persons violating tlie election laws. The provisions of this familiur title uf the revised statutes have been put into exercise by both the great po litical parties, and in the North as well as iu the South, by the filing with the court of the petitions required by the law. "It is not, therefore, a question whether we shall haven Federal election law, for we now have one, und have had for nearly 20 jears, but whether we shall have au ef fective law. The present law stops just short of effectiveness, for it surrenders to the local authorities all control over the certification which establishes the prima facie right to a seat iu the house of repre sentatives. This defect should be cured, Kquahly of representation ami the purity of the electors must be maintained or every thing that is valuable in our system of gov ernment is lost. The qualifications of an elector must be sought iu the law, not in the opinions, prejudices or fears of any cIibs, however pouerful. The path of the elector to the ballot Itox must be free from the ambush, of the fear and the entice ments of fraud; the count wj tl ue aud open that none shall gainsay it Such a law should be Impartial. It nhould give the ad vantage to honesty and the control to ma jonties Surely there is nothing sectional about this creed, and if it shall happen that the penalties of laws intended to enforce these rights fail here and not there, it is not because the law is actional, but le rausp, happily, crime is local and not uni versal. Nor should it Ihi forgotten that every law, whether relating to elections or to any other subject, whether enacted by the state or by the nation, has force behind ft. The courts, the marshal or constable, the jiosk? vomituluH, the prison, are all and always behind the law. "One cannot be jiutly charged with un friendliness to any section or class who seeks onlv to restrain violations of law mid of personal right No community will Hud lawlessness profitable. No community can afford to have it known that the oflicer who are charged with the preservation nf the public peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves th prttduct of fraud or violence. The magistrate is then without respect and the law without sanction The floods of lawlessness cannot be levied and made tn run in one channel The killing of a United States marshal car rying a writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting and suggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against life or property But ft is said that this legislation will revive race animosities, and some have even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible they may be supplant ed by intimidation and violence. If the firo posed law gives to any qualified electo", y a hairs weight, more than his equal in fluence, or detracts by so much from any other qualified elector it is fatally impeached. Hut it tlie law is equal aud the animosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors have been accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as for them selves, then these animosities ought not tn be confessed without shame, and cannot be given any weight in discission without dis honor No choice is left to nie but to en force with vigor all law-s intended to secure to the citizen his constitutional rights, and to recommend that the inadequacy of such taws be promptly remedied. "If to promote with zeal and ready inter est every project for the development of its material interests, its rivers, harbors, mines and factories, and the intelligence, peace and security under the law of its communities and its homes, is not accepted as sufficient evidence of friendliness to any state or section I cannot add connivance at election practices that not only disturb local results, but rob the electors of other states and sections of their most priceless political rights. In 4'onrliiiaii. "The preparation of the general appro priation bills should be conducted with the greatest care and the closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appropriations should bf adequate to the needs of the public service, but they should be absolutely free from prodigafity. I venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining for the con sideration of the inqortunt legislation now awaiting your attention offers no margin for waste. If the present duty is dis charged with diligence, fidelity, and cour age, the work of the 51st Congress tiny be confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people.

VMIMUSTS HdO.U TO WW. Tlir Woutlrrfnl (Stonlh of I In Itimr VUliiL'--. The Ikhi ruing towns of the West always attract the man who likes rush ami hurry, business and grow th It has been my privilege to visit tlmt jtortion of our coun try and see for myself the bustle of a west ern towu. Perhaps my education had been defective, but I must confess that it did uot suit me, I liked the bustle aud uoise of business but there was a general air of incompleteness which I did not like. As a consequence I was homesick. I came back to Vermont and determined to stay here In some respects it is a slow-going old state, yet in others it has plenty of stir for a loug life and peaceful existence. Glorious are the grand old mountains and glorious are the people. In many ways iiarre is a western town in everything but location. It is booming ; no other word expresses its growth. Kike a mushroom it has sprung up in a night, but it is destined to stand forever for it is founded on granite. The first -formed rock of the eons agone is its foundation and its wealth. As long as these hills yield their riches so long will Barre flourish like the young bay tree and be an honor and a won der to herself aud the state. Ten years ago this was a town of 2700 inhabitants; now it numbers nearly if not quite 7000. A major portion of the growth has been iu the past five years. Still it continues to grow. 'There will be no limit to the growth when once the stone becomes known. Old Barre was nut different in any essen tial particular from the scores of villages scattered all over the state. It had good educational and religious privileges and a moderate amount of manufacturing, still it did uot change iu uny important way from year to year, and shared iu the vicissitudes of other parts of the state. New Barre has risen Phonix-like from the old. It is a booming, bustling town, crowded with foreigners who are seeking work or homes. As a rule they make de sirable citizens, but some had better have stayed at home thau to have come here stir ring up discord aud strife. Iarge new blocks are goiug up everywhere and new streets are being laid in all directions, The hillsides are blooming as the gardeus of tunes gone by, and all along the sides of the hills are perched dwellings varying from a mansion to a small cottage. Beau tiful gardens and law us, aud elegaut resi dences greet one at every turn. Nothing like it has been seen iu Vermont since the first settlers came and began their homes along the valleys aud the rivers. It has been impossible for the buildings of the tow n to keep pace with the unprece dented growth in (Herniation. As a conse quence one finds room at a high premium. Stores are tucked into all sorts of back cor ners, or way out of the line of general bus iness enterprise because there was no room for them nearer the centres, Some of the most imortaut business places are forced back until they are almost lost in the maze of alleys and the crooked back streets. This is nothing aguinst the town. Indeed, some of the new blocks are models of streugth and beauty, while all are solid and substantial. Along on the meadow s are immense sheds fitted w ith machinery for cutting ami pol ishing the stone quarried on the lulls four miles away. Year by year the covered space is added to so that later the whole level portions will be roofed in and used as workshops for the cutters and polishers. The machinery used has much of it been invented since Barre became known as a producing centre of valuable granite. The growth of the knowledge of working the stone has, in a measure, been coincident with the development of the industry in this town. In fact Barre workmen have, in one way and another, contributed in a great degree to the present knowledge of working and using the stone. The nationality which has contributed most to the development of the quarries is the Scotch. They are everywhere and they make good citizens in the main. From them Americans have gained a larger part of their present knowledge of the granite business. It has been their strong shoul ders which have borne the heat and burden of the day, and it has beeu their cutters and polishers who have made Barre granite famous for elegance and utility. All honor to the Scotch. Let us have more of them, till all our hillsides echo their rich, musical brogue, If one were to find any fault with Barre it would be with the wretched condition of her streets. Sending annually thousands of paving blocks tn distutit towns and cit ies it would seem that she might spare suf ficient to put her own streets in proper shape, or at least make them passably de cent Now they are ull mud worked into the consistency of thin mortar by the con stant passing of heavily loaded teams. It is well nigh impossible to find a crossing which is passable. Concrete pavements are being laid in some parts of the town, but there is doubt as to their permanent utility under the heavy traffic uf the town, and iu the end, doubtless, granite pavements will have to be put in. Barre proper is not the only village in the limits of the township. There is Web bterville, a hamlet located up ueur the quar ries, which is growing fast, and by aud bv will rival some of the more pretentious vil lages, A boarding-house is there, accom modating a large number of quarrymen, and a collection of smaller houses. The general appearance Is neat and tasteful. There are iu addition to this, a number of other collections of houses which might be called villages, and some day they will claim that distinction with au nhurance that the claim will stand. These little vil lages accommodate the woikmeii better than the larger one. Today the land is va cant ; to-tnorrow there are houses in proc ess of erection, and next week there is a full-grown village smiling nut from among the stones and knolls, It U Al.i.itKK The rlwlit way to cute catarrh, Is to eradicate tlie hIhoii from the Hlximms tuhil which causes tlieuuuutse, by taking Hunt's KarsaiMrilla I)ysHapsla In Us worst form will i ietd to the use of Carter's I .title Serve pills aided by (letter 1 Jver Pills.
