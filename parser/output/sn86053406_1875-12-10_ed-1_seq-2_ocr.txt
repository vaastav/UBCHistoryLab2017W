HERALD AND MAIL. With Supplement. Friday nftrnlng, Uee.10, 1873. This from the Chicago Times: "In the population of Tennessee, there are two dogs to every man; and this fart goes a long way xowaru accounting lor the hitherto unex plained popularity of Parson Brownlow's paper." Boss W . SI. Tweed has escaped from prison in New York, where lie has been oon fined several years. He was allowed to visit his wife, accompanied by an officer. Tweed was allowed to go upstairs and converse with his wife several minutes, but he never returned, and made good his escape. The democratic House of Represents tives wisely chose for their Speaker, lion m.k.. Jvorr, or Indiana. He wag warmly supported by Southern Representatives. In the Liemocratic Cations, there were four can muaics, iverr, Knndall, Cox and Saylor. On the third ballot, the vote stood: Kerr. e Randall 63, Cox 7, Snyler I. On motion of Randall, the nomination was made unani mous. Hon. Geo. M. Adams, ex-memlerof Congress from Kentucky, was nominated for Clerk. John J. Thompson, of Ohio, was nominated for Sergeant-at-Arms on the first ballot. L. H. Fitzliugh, of Texas, was nomi nated for Doorkeeper. He was Hergeant-at-Arms for the Confederate Congress. James Htewart, of Va., was nominated for Post master. Rev. J. L. Townsend, of Washing ton, an Episcopalian, was nominated for Chaplain. Of course all these nominations were equivalent to election, and the candi dates were all elected on Monday. Mr. Kerr's election will give the Democratic party prestige Is fore the country. Let Congress act as wisely in everything else it does, and we may expect to elect Bayard, Hendricks, Tilden or some other good Democrat for our Centennial President. Gen. N. B. Forrest lias joined tbe Cum berland Presbyterian Cburch. Gen. Babcock, Grant's Private Secre tary, has been indicted by the grand jury at St- Louis, for complicity in the whisky frauds and swindling the Government. The No P opery and Forced Educaticj portions of the President's Message mean that he is a third term candidate, and is appealing to what he deems religious prejudices. This will not win with sound Protestants. II. 1. Itiddle is the Democratic candi date in tiie 1th Dist. ict for Coogress, to fill a racancy. V. M. Woodcock is the Republican candidate. The full Demo cratic majority in the District is 10,000 Election next week. T...:,it n .1 1 icmuciii vioiii snys luai inia IS Ins last anuual message before his successo 18 elected. Why did he not say this is his last annual message? Because he expects to be a candidate for the third term. Ihis is exactly what this sentence means. A Bill has been introduced in the Sen ate to aid the Texas Pacific Railroad. We are opposed to Government aiding the road, but if the aid is given, we hope the Southern members will see to it that it secures a Southern road to the P cifie, and not merely a St Louis and Pennsvl van: a ltoad with a Southern name. Is the gauge to be the Southern 5 feet or the xSortherii four feet and eight and a ha mcnes- i ins may be an important mat ter. President's ITessaga. President ('r.-iut'.s message to Congress is very lengthy, but not specially interest ing. His remarks on education and tax ing church property probably have more significance than any other portion of his message : As we are now about, to enter upon a second ecntenniul, commencing our man hood as a uat.ou.it is well to look bick upon the past and study what will be best to preserve end advance our future great ness. From the fall of Adam for his transgression to the present day, no na tion has ever been free frem threatened Hangers to its prosperity and happiness. We should look to the dangers threaten ing us, and remedy them so far as lies in onr power. He are a republic whereof one man m as good us another before the law. Under such a form of government it is of the greatest importance that all should be possessed of intelligence and education enough to cast a vote with a right understanding of its meaning. A large association of ignorant men cannot for any considerable period oiTer a suc cessful resistance to tyranny or oppres sion from the educated few, whether di rected by the demagogue or by priest . raft. Hence the education of the masses becomes of the first necessity for the pre-s-rving, because they have secured the cr jatest good to tbe greatest proportion ol n.o population of any form of govern-m-nt yet devised. All other fonts of K'ernment approach it just in proportion he general diffusion of education aud i d'pendeiice of action. As tbe piinia .. rep, therefore, to our advancement i . 1 tht has marked our progress in I.- past century, J snugest to your car tM consideration, and most earnestly re.. nmend it, that a Consti'iitional A.-..vldinent Op submitted fo the Legisla tors of the several States forratificatinn mAng it the duty of each of the several rSsrasto establish and forever maintain t public schools, adequate to the ed-k-j i nof all the children in tbe rndimen fM branches within tin ir respective lim i... j. espctjve of sex, color, birthplace r religion, forbidding the teaching in said a of religious atheistic or p;gan ! -, mid prohioitin.'i the granting of a y hool lunds or school tuxes, or any p-r. .hereof", either by legislative, intiniv ein.' or otherwise, lot- the benefit of any et- r object of any nature or kind what- vr, 1.. connection with this important -ues ti-'-, I would als. call vonr Attention in tfc .oiponance ot correcting an evil, that it permitted to continue, will probably 0 great trouble in our land before tV-close of tbe nineteenth century. It ia the accumulation of vast amounts of 'taxed church property. In sr0. 1 brieve, the church property r.f tbe United fVtes which paid t.o lux, municipal or RMe, amounted to a bout S-'-ll.lH 0,l!(l0; in 3 '60 the am. Mint bad doubled: in 175 it is about $l,httMHM.oi 0. '. l'.lOO, without eheck, il is sale to say t !i;s" prop. rty will reach a sum exceeding !?:'..l('.( '0.000. I' vns' a sum reccivicii all the protec tion rid beaehts ot (l e-.-r itii'Mit, without bearing its proportion (f the burden and expenses ot the sa tn, will nt be looked upon aciiuiestvn'.iy by tbo.-e who have paid taxes. In a growir.g country where real estate enhances so rapidlv witb time, as in the I'ni'ed Slates, "there is scarcely a limit to tbe wealth tl at mny be acquired by corpot allot, s, religious or Otherwise, allowed t retain real estate without taxation. The contemplation of o vast a property ;s here alluded to, without taxation, may lead to sequestra tion, without constitutional authority, and possibly bloodshed. I would suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation, c"i uipting only the last resting place of tbe dead, and, possibly with proper restrictions, church edifices. A Patriotic Speech. Hon. L. (. C. Lamar, of Miss., was made chairman of the Democratic Con TTfus, which assembled Saturday in the Jlall of Representatives, to nominate candidates for Speaker, ("let k and other fficers of the Ilou.-e. Mr. I.atrar, on raking the chair, made the following mag nifieent speech: lie said they bad been ;iven this most important branch of I lie Government, because the people were dissatisfied with tbe uial-aduiimstration ol tbe civil ser vice, and he hoped they would show by their course ihey method the trust. He declared the public taith should lie feerved inviolate, and that the United (Hates ought to maintain a currency, which should b? r s grod us that of any ation in the world. He expressed the desire to sec nil cortuptions uncovered, od full protection t f lav accorded to ev try one, without regard to race or color. He closed with a glowing tribute to the nag ot tbe republic. bit. Lamar concluded bis eloquent speech as follows: The people demand at our hands . sweeping and thorough re form in the civil service, which shall be conducted io a spirit that will secure the appointment to places of trust and re sponsibility, tbe honest, tbe experienced, and the capable, lhere is also an im perative demand that a vigilant examina tion be ".ade into tbe administration in the public revenue ot the country, that all the public accounts shall be scrutinized by us, and corruption be ferreted out, and wrong-doers, no matter how high or how low, shall be fearlessly arraigned and fulful exposed and punished. One ot the most pressing demands upon us is to perfect and adopt such a system of taxation as will bring in the required revenue with the lewest restrictions upon commerce, and with the least burden to the people, and tbat the burden shall be equitably distributed and killtully adjusted. U ing to the exigencies of one of those in ternecine conflicts incident to the life of almost every country, also a pernicious system ot legislation, our people are suf fering from the evils ot an irredeemable currency. In meeting and grappling difficulties of this vital and perplexing question, it will be your dnty to take care that nothing is done which would impair the good faith of the country, or tarnish the public honor, or lower or dis turb the credit of our government, but we are to remove those obstructions which bar the- progress and check the prosperi- ty ol the American people. It is our du ty as Democrats, it is the daty and glory of the Democratic party while it controls this house, to see that the national cur rency of the Democratic republic is made equal io that of mnj nation on the earth, and that the grandest aspirations of the Democratic party and iti crowning glory will be to restore the Constitution, to re store its strength and authority, to make it the protector of every section and State in tbe Union, and of every human beiDg of every color and condition in the land. Apprehension and distrust of one part of the nation for that portion of the South ern people arrayed against the authority of the Federal Governmeut in the late war, would be an element of disturbance to the American- Union, but has rniinlj dsiappeared, as is evinced by your elec tion, and in its stead has grown a more fraternal feeling which regards us of the Southern States as fellow-citizens of a great nation. On the other hand, tbe people of whom I am one, are here to d:iy by their chosen representatives to honor any draft which the American nation may draw upon their patriotism or their faith in the glory and beneficence of American institutions. Applause. The experi ment which has been introduced among us. based upon the confidence in the working of a local self-government, and intended to solve the difficulties connec ted with the recent social and political transformation, shall have An Open Field and Fair Play, and no hindrance shall be placed in the way of its rigorous development and its ample success. Ap plause. J We want a Government that we can love and rerere and serve from the motives of reverence and love. We hunger for a patriotism which Ehall knit all the people together ia a generous, lov iug brotherhood. Let us not torget that the great victory of last fall which brought us here was not achieved alone by D. mocraticjvotes, but with the co-op erating eflorts of independent patriots and unselfish men of all parties, tired and alarmed by the increasing evils resultiug from corruption and mal-administi&tion Reforms are urgently needed Let us wisely make them. A renewed prosper ity is everywhere urgently desired. Let us secure it by removing unjust discrimi nations, by imposing rigid economy, by restoring a sound currency, by (ecuring the rights of all States and all the peo ple. Tennessee State Eon&s.

TES1TESSE FAS1IESS TO THE J OKI. Call for a Convection of Breeders. The Breeders of Improved Stock of every variety are Earnestly invited. The KuralKuu. Tbe price of lands in Tennessee, to ne-her with tbe radical change- in tbe system of labor, making a complete rev olution in the agriculture ot t lie coun try, and tbo stringency of mouelary liiatteiB, awaken us to the necessity tf finding some better mode ot converting our labor, money and utuds into profit and prosperity. Our s is a lau-J eminently adapted to stock, grain and grass; but we have found that it does not par to raise, ban- die and feed the ordinary stock of the country known as scrubs: hence it be liooves us to loon about lor a more prof- ltible sort, ana to learu tee most sue cestui nioilo of feeding, caring for breemiii: and the general management otsiiv.li. Jtierefore, alter consultation with mativ ot our best farmers and stock owers, we are solicited to make the announcement that a convention of breeders of improved stock of every va riety will be held at Nashville, ihe sec. nd Wednesday Id 1-eouary, attlieKu- liAt. si x oflice, under the Maxwell House, to consider such topics as are ot interest and for tbe improvement of the lovers of tine stock. We have seen tbe immense r6vinue from this source which flows into thr borders of our sis. tor Slate, Kentucky, annually. More than bait a million of dollars worth ol line stock have been sold in tbe Blue tJiHHs region within the last few weeks; and iu her footsteps most or the W es tern SiHtes have followed closely, leav ing Tenness' e in the background, groan ing over her lailure in cotton. These States, most of llieiii have had conven tions Unit have In en most successful Kss-tys have been read ou the manage ment, breeding, etc., ol cattle, horses. sheep, swine and poultry. Discussions have arisen upon tbe relative merits o different breeds and different families of particular breeds. By this means we become a brotherhood, and, knowing vtat each oiner nave, point t tie custo mer to where it can be found. There aro advantages innumerable in a convention, end it is a matter ot vast importance to every breeder of improv ed stock in ihe State of Tennessee. We inherit the most fertile soil, the most delightful climate, the grandest scenery and the purest water upon the earth." Yet these rare and beautiful en dow merits aie us yet left in a latent state. Let us shake off lethargy, aud open our eyes to the rich fields all about us. Let every breeder come, and let hi m be not afraid to speak bis thoughts. Let us uoite and work en masse to pro mote the stock interest of our country, and thereby add wealth to its farmers. Lei hs build up a market and a charao ter for imprnv ed sioik, and direct tbe attention of tbe world to Tennessee for the finest specimens of breeding ani mals. This can be done; we possess ad vantages nowhere else to be found, but we must bavo knowledge, system, labor love and unity All these should be lound in a convent! n. We earnestly beg of you to meet us at the Knui, Svs oflice, Wednesday, February, tub, 1S75, at 10 am. We prom ise our most cordial hospit ality. It now teims quite probable that lion. W. C. Whitthorne will be named as Chairman ol the House Committee on naval affairs. This will be a deserved compliment to one of the ablest men n the House. The position will give him a national reputation. Convening of Congress. The American. The Fofty lourth Congress convened Monday under very favorable auspices. The interest in the occasion was very great, and a large crowd was ou baud to witness the opening ceremonies some to pick any olhcial crumb tbat might be iy ing around loose- Mr. Kerr was elected Speaker by a strict party vote, and the other fficers of the House, nominated in democratic caucus, were all duly elected If the Senate Mr. Key was sworn in and took his eeat. There was a breezy debate in tbe House over the interminable Lou isiana question, which developed some thing of partisan bias on both sides, but was finally disposed of, as we think, very propeny. Ex-Speaker Blaine presented the case on his 6ide very strongly, so strongly, indeed, that he earned the House wi h him. The Louisiana usurpa tion of two years ago was one of tbe greatest outrages ever perpetrated, but as there was since a compromise agreed to by both parties in that State, which was evidently intended to be inal and effect ual until the next election, it is not tbe part of wisdom now for Congress to seek to undo that compact. Louisiana, like Mississippi, will shake off her oppress ions, and, like Mississippi, she will do it in the regular way, at the ballot box. The Democrats are starting out with mod eration, which augurs a great deal better than if, as in the case of .Republican ma iorities of former Congresses, partisan promptings were ueeueu tuiuuu iuiuo and thin. Slavery Preferred. From the Pulaski Citizen- Somewhere about the year 184 i Judge Wm. E. Kennedy ot Maury county, long since deceased, entertaining doubts as to the propriety of holding "human souls in bondage,'' as Wended Phillips would say, concluded to manumit his slaves, and send them by installments to Liberia. Hav'mg arranged with the colonization society, he called up thirty of his slaves to counsel them, and give them his part ing blessing. Among the thirty was Cy rus, a blacksmith, end a good one at tbat, who hesitated, and seemed to have some misgiving as to the pleasuie of being eat en by President Roberts' cannibals. Nor would he consent to go, until his master agreed that be might return in case be shouldn't like his African home, and re turn to be a slave for life. The new made freedman with this understanding set sail for his far-off Ethiopian home. In due time the trusty ship measured At lantic's watery waste, and dropped anch or at an African port. Having remained perhaps for a year, amid Libeiian jun gles, he became disgusted with gorillas, and the revolting savagery of his new made friends in human shape, he began to sigh for "tierce blood hounds, the cruel lash, and galling chains," with which "uncle Tom's cabin'' fired the northern heart. So, bidding adieu to the king of Dohomie, he bent his eager gaze to the sun set shores of the "land of the free and the home of the brave.'' His gallant ship stood out to sea, he waved a long auieu to Afric s golden strands, and in lormignt 8 time, neara the " toe line in the quiet waters of N. Y. harbor, Acd what then? The precious boon of freedom was still his own, and as was natural he was loath to give it up. So he bethought him of swee Oberlin, (Ohio,) the region of goats' milk, and good old "Western Kesarve" and the paradise of the sable fugitives irom cruel southland. I hither went tbe returning exile, and cast in his lot among the original projectors of the fW mous under-ground K. R. Glad to meet the "man and brother." All went lovely for a time. But Cyrus soon learn ed tnat nis new friends would : skin a flea for his hide and tallow," and that they demanded the "bricks without the tiles," and he sighed by reason of the hard bondage, and wished for a Moses to lead him away from this modern Egypt, while he sang in his heart, ' though his lips moved not 'Away down upon the Swanee River, Far, far, away, Dare's where my heart is tuniin ever, Dare's where de old folks stay. All "round de whole creation, Sadly I roam. Still loimin lor de old plantation, And for de old folks hi home." And with this he gathered up what these, "men of Jericho'' bad left of his substance, and turning to his old Tennes see home, with a face swarthed by the hot suns of Africa, and as to mach soured by the Ohio cheese, he caught up the last stanza of Sambo's favorite lyric-- "All de world am sad and dreary, F.tiery where I roam, Oh! dai kies how my heart prows weary, sighing for de old. folks at home." On and on he came, and by and bv. the Louisville stage halted at the old "Nashville Inn. Her cargo of passen gers, Cyrus among them, was transferred to the double decker ot Price, 1 homas and Hough, bound for Columbia, with Uncle Tommy on the seat, the best four in hander that ever drew a rein or crack ed a whip. Cyrus never was gladder to see his daddy, than he was to hail "Uncle Tommy," and his four bouncing bays. He felt that he was almost home. Away they went, and e'er the "blazing sun was set," gazing from the upper deck of his Tray c oath, lie descried the distant crest of Mount 1 arnasus, clothed in the roautle of azure hue, overlooking Columoia, and in goodly viewol tbe old plantation home. ll;s feeling ma3T be better imagined than described. He had lied the burning suns and scorching sands of African Saharas, escaped tbe dangers of the wide, wide sea, and the perils among ialse brethren, and reported to the old folks at home, a slave for life, but a wiser man. I yrus is still living in Maury, a skillful artisan and a respectable citizen. Centerville (Ga.) Advocate: On Mon day last, while some laborers on the plan tation oi" Mr. J. Rowland were engag ed in felling trees, some two or three hun dred yards north west of his residence, they were attracted by a pile of rocks which lay upon the ground, east and west, and in Eouiewhat ol giave-likc shape and dimensions. J hev at once resolved to investigate, and laid aside their ax-sfor the more entertaining labor of scattering the rocks right and left. At the bottom, and lying upon its back, was the skeleton of a man. The smaller bones were en lirelv gone dissolved into dust; but the skull, n portion of the pelvis and bones of Die limbs were distinct. An ordinary car ving-knife, much rust-eaten, a fiat, lor eign looking brass button, and a bar of lead rested with the dead. A few rusty nails were found, also, which would indi cate that the sepulcher had once contain ed a cofbn. The most reasonable deduc tion is, in our opinion, that the deceased was a Confedeiate soldier, and met his death in defense of his flag. Atlant1 Herald: Yesterday a number of persons from Henry county came up to the city in carriages and wagons for the purpose of taking the cars for Louis iana, which they intend to make their fu ture home. Among the emigrants was a young country lass of about sixteen sum mers, who, with her parents, was taking leave of her native State for the far West. There came with them as tar as the city a youth of some eighteen years, who was in love with a girl. As soon as the com pany arrived at the car shed, he and his sweetheart paired off in one corner of the saloon, where for one hour be poured out his heart's true sentiment in language and acta which none but a youthful lover can use under such circumstances. Fi nally his bursting bosom could contain no more and it slopped over in loud and agonizing '"boo-hoos" that would have done creuit to a yearling calf, then, wringing his hands and rocking to and fro, would plead iD an inaudible tone for her hand and heart, all the time crying as if his heart would break. Tbe girl appear ed calm and unmoved. CozTixUiTantecL
