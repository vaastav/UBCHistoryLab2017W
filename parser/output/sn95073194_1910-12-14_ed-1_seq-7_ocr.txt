ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For tification of Panama Canal Lead ing Topics Discussed--Has Little to Say About Tariff. Washington, Dec. 6. Economy in government affairs is the keynote of President Taft's annual message read before both houses of congress today. The message approximates 40,000 words and is one of the longest ever submitted by a president. Conservation of the public domain, Bhip subsidy, fortification of the Pana ma canal and the continuation of the present tariff board are the leading subjects touched upon. He also re views the work of the various gov ernment departments and concurs in recommendation, tending toward the bettering of the service, made by sev eral of the members of his cabinet.

On the subject of conservation lie de votes considerable space to forest, coal, oil and gas. phosphate lands anil water power sites. As to the reservation of foieM lands he says: "The law now pro hibits the reservation of any more forest lands in Oregon. Washington. Idaho. Montana, f'olorad.i and Wyoming, except by act of congress. I nm informed by the dep.n tment of agriculture that the gov ernment owns other lract.s of timber bind in these states which should be included In the forest resertes.

Ship Subsidy.

"I am afraid to go near Sharp's house or to meet him: he has such a vicious dog for a pet." "Hut you must remember that Sharp cons'ders himself such a cynic he wouldn keep any other dog than a biting kind." Department of the Interior. Seymour Did you visit the depart ment of the interior while you were In Washington? Ashley I guess so; I was in the cafe where the congressmen eat. tion unable to avail in international mari time business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial In tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff. In the space devoted to the tariff the president says: "The schedules of the rates of duty In the Payne tariff act have been subjected to a great deal of criticism, some of It just, more of It unfounded, and too much misrepresentation. The act wa3 adopted In pursuance of a declaration by tho par ty which is responsible for It that cus toms bill should be a tariff for the pro tection of home Industries, the measure of the protection to lie the difference be tween the cost Vif producing the Imported, article abroad and the cost of producing It at home, together with such addition to that difference, as might give a reasonable profit to the home producer. The basis for the criticism of this tariff is that in respect to a number of the schedules tho declared measure was not followed, but a higher difference retained or Inserted by way of undue discrimination In favor of certain Industrie and manufactures. Lit tle. If any. of the criticism of the tariff has lieen directed against the protective principle above statnl; hut the main body of the criticism has been based on the at tempt to conform to the measure of pro tection was not honestly and sincerely adhered to." The president also refers to the appoint ment of a board of experts to Investigate the cost of production of various articles int hided in the schedules, of tlse tariff, and concludes: "Whether or not the protective policy Is t'l be (ontiniieil. and the degree of protec tion to be accorded to our home Indus tries, are questions which the people must decide through their chosen representa tives. Hut whatever pulley is adopted, it is cjeir that the necessary legislation :-lonld lie hasetl on an lmiiartl.il. thor ough and continuous studv of the facts." Recommends Parcels Post. The adoption of tli parcels post Is again adopted. On tills subject President Taft says: "With respect to the parcels post. I respectfully recommend lis adop tion on all rural delivery routes, and that II pounds-tln international limit be made the limit of carriage In such post. The same argument is made against the parcels post that was made against the postal savings bank- that It is Introduc ing the government Into a business wh!cl: should tie conducted by private persons nnd is paternalism. The postofllce depart ment has a great plant and a great or ganization, reaching Into the most rpinuN hamlet of the I'nlted States, and with this machinery it Is able to do a great manv things economically that If a new organisation were mtvssary it would Ua impossible to do without extravagant ex penditures." Department of Justice. Discussing the affairs of the department of justice, the president says: "I Invite especial attention to tli prose cutions under the federal law of the so called 'bucket .shops.' and of thos .schemes to defraud In which the use of the mail Is an essential part of the fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which have kavt-d ignorant and weak members of the public and are saving them hun dreds of millions of dollars. The viola tions of the anti-trust law present per haps the most Important litigation b--for the department, and the number of cases Hied shows the activity of the govern ment in enforcing that statute. "In a special message last vear T brought to the attention of congress the propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen eral law providing for the Incorporation of industrial and other companies engaged In interstate commerce, and I renpw my lecommendatlon in that behalf." Th crying need In the I'nlted States of cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying Judicial procedure and ex pediting final judgment Is pointed out and action looking to correction of these evils is urged. The prerldcnt recommends an increase In tli" salaries of federal Judges. Postal Affairs. In regard to postal matters the pres dent points with pride to its present effi cient management ami the recent reduc tion In" the deficit. The present unre stricted franking privilege comes in for comment with a suggestion for the adop tion of better tiuthods for its regulation. Abolish Navy Yards. The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by the secretary of the navv which he recommends for adoption, and continues; "The st cretary of the navy has given pwiir.il i vamlnatlon to every navy yard, and h:.s studied the uses of the navv yr.rds with rtforence to the necessities of our fit et. With a tleet considerably It ss than half the size of that of the Hntish navy, we have shipyards: more than double the number, and thci are several of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern mehinory. which, after Investigation the secretary of the navy believes to be entirely useless for naval purposes, lie asks authority to abandon certain of them ami to move their machinery to other places, where It can be made of use." Speakit.g of our "foreign relations the president savs- "Purine the past yenr the foreign relations of the t'nited States have continued upon a basis of friendship and gootl understanding. "The year has Iwoti notable as witness ing the pacific settlement of two imp r lant international controversies before the jiermanent court i f The Hague.

President Taft makes a few recommen dations lor changes In the Interstate com merce law and says: "Kst ept as above. I do nit recommend any amendment to the int-rstate com merce law as It stands. I do not invr recommend any amendment to the anti trust law. In other words, it seem-: to me wiai me exi-simg iegisl ition with n ft rence to the regulation of corpora tions antl the restraint of their business has reached a point w litre we can stop for a wlille antl v.-!tr..s the effect of the vigorous execution f the l-jxnt of the statute ! ooks in restraining the abuses which .ertainlv did xist and which roused the public to dtn-.and reform."
