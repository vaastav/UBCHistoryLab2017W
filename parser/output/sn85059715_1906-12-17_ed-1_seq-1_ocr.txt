Antohny GRAFTON POLITICS ANDJTOW RUN Form An Interesting Topic* For a Traveling: Man Who Scores 44The Rambler" There. A Telegram reporter has this bit of news from a traveling man concerning the way politics are run down in Grafton. Here is the story i CJ?ICU IU IUC i cyui lci . "I had some work down In one corner of Taylor county which required me to remain there over two Sabbath days. I was stopping at a small farm house In a turn of the road and one of the most isolated places on earth It appeared to tne those two long Sabhath days. I naturally looked up something to read and on ' thorough search T found some school books, two farm journals and the Grafton Leader. It was always troublesome for me to become interested in school books and so I began on the Weekly Leader. I soon became very much taken with an article over the name of 'Rambler.' In which he was roasting the Grafton mayor and council for many misdoings and especially the mayor for having connection with and protecting certain indicidaals and street shows. In the next issue which T found contained a column and a half scoring the mayor on various matters and in particular T remember about being implicated in some speakeasies along with the chief of police. I concluded, therefore, that Grafton muftt be a pretty gay town and its mayor a fine fellow and made up my mind to stop off there on the first opportunity. A short time ago I was coming In from the east one Saturday evening. My train was late and I admit T had one treat ahead and felt pretty tough. When T awoke it was late and my head feW Hke I~ had just been knocked over the ropes. My bottle was empty and water ttinted like quicksand going down my throat. It ait once began to wonder where T could get a tip to quench the thirst when 'Rambler's 'press artides came fresh In my mind and I decided to hunt up that dolly mayor ras usual Ending icene and began to give Abies a >!ece or her mind In emphatic and ndlgnant expostulation. The mag- , striate would not stand for such ibuse of the prosecuting witness ( ind he ordered the woman out of ( :onrt. She went outside bnt in a , ittle bit she had her head through ( he door and offered some more e Gratuitous Expletive. j Thereupon the magistrate ordered i ter taken to tail by Constables Lyon > md CotTmnn for contempt of court, t She was released after a few hours' r tay In the bastlle. o At the conclusion of the hearing t Nonstable Coffman handed to the ourt a warrant against the prosecutng witness .which had been Issued it the Instance of Minerva Gum, of lorthvlew, charging him with atempting to evade the payment of a Ii card will of $3.00. Robey was tak- u n to Jail to await a hearing before b he magistrate Tuesday. . b .O #7i ; - '.. . ^S TRIAL PROGRESS * .?: ? Ldghtner, Hark Koblegard, D. W. Clausson and Llojrd Kennedy. Prosecuting Attorney Will E. Morris and James W. Robinson, represent the State .and Charles C. Coffman and E. G. Smith the defendant. with Judge Charles W. Lynch trial Judge. The first witness was Benjamin Cottrlll. who testified that Rodgeway and Scott had a discussion In the engine room over the diameter of a valve, Scott contending it was 1 1-4 inches and Ridgeway saying it was 1 1-2 inches. Then they went np stairs to the ware room to have James Connors decide the matter. Cottrlll followed them and as he arrived Ridgeway called Scott a damn liar and the latter turned and hit Ridgeway with the valve, inflicting a fatal wound. Cottrlll's evidence did not seem especially strong for the State. of Grafton. Wihen I got on the streets the church bells were ringin gand people both old and young were going both up and down In droves, evidently to church, and the town seemed as quiet as a country village. I walked up and down and finally bumped into one of the police. T asked to see the mayor and was lead through a hall and up stairs but we failed to find him. In answer to the officer's questions If r had lost something .etc., I told my business and was told the only way T could possibly get a drink was to consult a physician and get a prescription and that was a doubtful case. Piqued at this disappointment T then asked the officers where all rue speakeasies ana last places were located which the mayor had been reported as harboring and I went on to explain where I had got my information. To my surprise I was informed there was nothing of the kind in the town nor had not been since the present mayor had been in office. I was further informed that this writer 'Rambler* was simply a scape goat for a gang of politicians who had been rooted out and was taking this way to try to make the citizens believe, if possible, that the other side was as corrupt as the fellows they had turned out. I went back to my hotel, gathered by grips and got out of that town on on the first train swearing that If the Grafton Trader had a wider circulation that "Tom Pepper's renown as the biggest Mar that ever lived would melt away like dew before a June day sun.* " '

TELLS OP HIS VISIT TO CANAL Recommendations, Among Which . Ta To Contract It. . IBy Aasocitiad Press.} WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 17? A special message was sent by President Roosevelt to Congress today on the Panama Canal. President Roosevelt relates the history of his visit, where he went, what he did and the observations he made of the work on the canal that has already been done. Each daV from 12 to 18 hoars were spent in going over and Inspecting all there was to ibe seen and In examining various employes. Work of the French. "At the outset." he says, "I wish to pay tribute to the amount of work done by the French Canal Company under very difficult circumstances. Many of the buildings they put up were excellent and are still in use, tho, naturally, the houses are now getting out of repair and are being used as dwellings only until other houses can be built, and much of the. work they did in the Culebra cut, and some of the work they did In ' digging has been of direct and real benefit. This country has never made a better investment than the $40,000,000 which it paid to the French Company for work and betterments. including especially the Panama Railroad. "An Inspection on the ground at' the height of the rainy season served to convince .me of the wisdom of Congress in refusing to adopt either a high-level or a sea-level canal. There seems to be- a universal agreement among all people competent to Judge that the Panama route, the one actually cnosen. is mucn superior to both the Nicaragua and Darlen routes." The President then tells of the preliminary work being done on the ranal. of The Successful Sanitation, the hospitals and their treatment, of bis finding the health showing to be remarkably good, and of the diminution of. mosquitos due to scientific extermination. "The first great problem to be solved." says the President, "upon the solution of which the success of tthe rest of the work depended, was the problem of sanitation. This was from the outset under the direction of Dr. W. C. Gorgas, who Is to be made a full members of the commission. if the law as to the composition of the commission remains I unchanged." 1 He tells of the Improvements In ' Panama and Colon, dwells on the ( Colon water supply and Colon's | pavements, tells o fthc established police system of the zone, and describes the care of employes. He states the quarters are good and satisfactory, the food Buppltes good snd that there Is no cause for com- | plaint about either. He dwells on f Chinese and other labor and states | that In the main the commission will have to rely for the ordinary mskliled work, partly upon color- ( sd laborers from the West Indies , snd partly upon Chinese labor. The American workers on the isthmus | ire the highly paid skilled meehan c"' ' 1 Confident of Ultimate Success.
