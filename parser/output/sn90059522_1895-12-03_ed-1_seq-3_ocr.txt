Andrew Antonson was accidently shot in the neck last evening by a com panion named mander Severson, in a lodging house at 205 Nicollet avenue. The ballet entered the neck just above the collar bone, penertating th*=" flesh some six inches. Antonson's condition last evening was cons ld red very criti cal and he may not survive. It seems that Anton and Severson with a companion named Gilbert have been working for the past three years in Sherburn, Sherbun county. They had saved up considerable money and arrived in the city yesterday on their way to the old country. They stopped at a lodging house. Last evening ail three -v re sitting talking and Anton son was exhibiting a revolver which he had based. Severson took the re volver to examine when it was acci detally discharged. Dr. S. M. Moultou was summoned and dressed Antonson's wound, mak ing him as comfortable as possble. The three have plenty of money and remained at the lodging house last night. If the injured man's condition is not improved he will be removed to the hospital today. Set-king- Hoyt's Suceesror. The deacons of the First Baptist church held a meeting last night to talk about a successor to Dr. Hoyt. They did not discuss any names in connec tion with the vacant pastorate, but devoted their time to praying for di vine guidance in the selection of a leader. It seemed to be their opinion that they will experience considerable trouble in getting a minister imme diately. Dr. Hoyt's resignation came when they were unprepared, and they do not know where to look for a new pastor. It is feared that a new pastor cannot be selected until next May, at the earliest. Died Without a Warning-. "Scott}-" Williamson dropped dead about 10:10 last evening in Green's London lodging house at 11 First ave nue north.

An autopsy will be performed today to determine the exact cause of death. Decided Not to Resign. Last Sunday forenoon Rev. Kincaid, of the Andrew Presbyterian church, notified the congregation that he was net going to leave them. After having talked th*- matter over with the session of the church, he had decided to reject the call from the First Presbyterian church of Lincoln, Neb. The decision of Rev. Kincaid affords great pleasure to the. members of his congregation, as ■well as to his many other friends with in the city, all of whom have vigorous ly objected to his leaving this field. The ladles of Andrews church are to tender the pastor a reception as a token of their appreciation. The event will take place next Wednesday evening at the church. Dad Ne*jvs for Cn-.li. The first Republican campaign club in the state was organized Saturday night ar.d started under way with great enthusiasm. The club is to be known as the Allison Republican Club of Min nesota. By the name it will be readily understood that William B. Allison, of lowa, will be boomed, and to his "ris ing star" the members pledge their faith. The paramount object of the club is to aid in the nomination of the "Western man by all fair and honorable means and to give him its hearty sup port after the nomination and during the campaign. Gave Up the Cash. TJpon the strength of a demand from Inspectors Howard and Doyle, Julius Johnson, a Bridge square employment agent, y-esterday gave William Becker man $80 -in cash. Beckerman Is a stranger in the city and hails from North Dakota. He told Supt. Smith that a "friend" whom he met on the street Saturday induced him to go to Johnson's place, where he was led in to some kind of a betting game. He Was separated from $100 of his money, and. when he complained, was given back $20. Later he reported the matter to the police, and Johnson gave back the balance. Minneapolis Humane Society.

DAY Of TRAGEDY. JUST ONE YEAR AGO OCCURRED THE MURDER OF CATHER- : INE GING, FOR WHICH HARRY WILL DIE NO ACTION YET TAKEN BY THE GOVERNOR IN FINING DATE. jj4 v GETTING THE GALLOWS READY. Sheriff?.". Reuuisitions Honored Hay*,vard Parts With His Weapons. '.- .*.-— ' One year ago tonight the body of Catherine Ging was found lying on the lonely Excelsior road in a pool of blood. One year ago Claus Blixt, engineer of the Ozark flats, incited by a stronger mind, fired the fatal shot. A year ago Harry F. Hayward the arch-plotter, was craftily con triving to cover up his connection with the murder for which lie now languishes under sentence of death. In -ill probability the anniversary of Hay-ward's crime will be signal ized by the issuance of the death warrant, which will give the sheriff of Hennepin county final-, authority, to execute the sentence of the law. Yesterday afternoon the elery of the supreme court mailed to Clerk , Dickey in Minneapolis the "man-, date" and "remittitur," signifying '. that the supreme court had made final disposition of the case. For some reason the papers did not reach the clerk's office yesterday, and will be delivered early this morning. Clerk Dickey will imme diately forward to Gov. Clough no- \ tice that all legal requirements and j proceedings have been complied j with. There is every reason to be lieve that the governor will imme diately issue the death warrant to Sheriff Holmberg. . -:_:,' '■'".. J PETITIONS FOR CLEMENCY have been coming to the governor in large numbers, many of them from, distant cities and states. Many of them have been from women, as is usually the case, and some of them quite well written. John Day Smith j is still circulating his petition, and has not presented it to the govenor. He will probably be a caller at the I executive rooms today. The peti tion of the Minneapolis physicians | has been presented, including separ- ' ate communications from several ! prominent specialists, relating to the [ existence of insanity in the Hay- j ward family. Gov. dough's mind is ; made up. and he is fully determined | to let the law take its course within j a reasonable time. It is certain that I he will not indulge in delay be tween the receipt of Clerk Dickey's ! message and the signing of the war- | rant. Some time this afternoon the \ sheriff's office will probably receive the warrant, fixing the date for Fri day, Dec. 13, or some date very near it. The sheriff will at once direct preparations for the final act of the tragedy of Excelsior road expiation. There was some discussion yesterday as to the proper legal form to be ob served under the circumstances. It is thought by some that the remittitur should be issued by the supreme court to the attorney general, but the statute does not bear out this interpretation. The message of the supreme court is to the lower court, announcing that the decision of the lower court has been affirmed, and returning the case for "further pro ceedings." SHERIFF'S FEES. The county commissioners yester day allowed Sheriff Holmbeig's bill of $50 for the gallows and $15 for the trap. There was some discussion among the members of the board as to the sheriff's fee for the hanging. There is no fee now prescribed by law, and if they wished, the com missioners could compel the sheriff to perform the disagreeable task for nothing. It is understood that the next legislature will have a bill up for passage fixing the fee at $250, and j this sum found favor among the commissioners. Hayward has begun the partition of his property by bestowing the fam ous revolvers on Inspectors Howard and Doyle, of the police force. The. 3S-calibre Colt's, with which Biixt fired the fatal shot, he gives to How ard, while Doyle gets the Rerringer. Last night he penned a letter to Frank Nye. which is as follows: Mr. Frank M. Nye: Please let Mr. James G. Boyle have my revolvers that were in evidence in the Ging murder case. (Signed) —Harry Hayward. Dated Oct. 8, 1895. The order was O. X.'d by Mr. Nye and passed on to Clerk Dickey, who is custodian of such treasures. Mr. Dickey thought he ought to have an order of the court, and accordingly ! went to Judge Smith, who said there ! was no reason why they should not go into such hands, and his signa ture was added to the document. Harry was not visited by his moth er yesterday. She was almost pros trated by the visits of Saturday and Sunday, and told the jail authorities Sunday that she would not teturn yesterday. Father Cleary made Har ry a short visit yesterday, and was his only caller during the day. TO SAVE HAYWARD. Minneapolis Physicians Sign a Petition for Clemency. Gov. Clough yesterday received a long letter from Dr. W. W. Williamson, of Minneapolis, in which he reviewed at some length the history of the Hay- I wards, pointing out that for several generations there had been insanity in the family, and drawing attention par ticularly to the evidences of it in Harry Hayward a<nd his father. Accompany ing the letter was a petition signed by several physicians of Minneapolis, among whom were Dr. Zier. who it will be remembered introduced a bill at the last session of the legislature doing away with capital punishment alto gether. Other physicians who signed the petition asking for clemency were: H. H. Kimball, Halvor, Sucre, H. W. Brockens, M. P. Yandernerch. Frank Burton, R. J. Hill, W. A. Jones and Charles Simpson. Besides Dr. Williams' letter and the petition there was a leter attached, which had been written by C. K. Bart lett, of Minneapolis, and formerly su perintendent of the St. Peter hospital, to John Day Smith, suggesting that the governor appoint a commission to examine into the history of Insanity In the family. He cites two cases where this has been done, one that that of a Chaska boy, during Horace Thomp son's reign as governor, where the sen tence was changed, and that of a man THE PAINT PAUL DAILY --GLOBE: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER J5, '1895.- ] at Fergus -Falls, convicted of murder ! during Gov. McGill's administration, where the sentence was not commuted. j The governor was not at the capitol i when these communications were re ceived, so no action was taken on them. The papers in the Hayward case were j sent yesterday afternoon back to the clerk of the district court of Henne* pin county, and the case wil probably be certified by him to the governor to day. CRIMINAL. LIST. ~ ' The New Grand Jury Will De Chart-red by Judge Jamison. Judge Jamison will this morning charge the new grand jury. The last one cleaned up all the work to within 1 a few days ago, and there is very little for them to do at this opening session. There are two charges against George | Baird, who yesterday went to Still j water, and a larceny charge against SI Lyons. These are the only jail cases, ; and there are only three held under , bonds. They are Andy Feeley and John Williams, charged with grand > larceny In the second degree, and | George Ellsworth, assault in the second ' degree. These three will answer to | their names before Judge Jamison to ! day. ! The criminal calendar numbers thir ty-two cases. It will be called this j morning, and appearance will be made j by the attorneys, with whom the dates [ for trial will be arranged. j John Benske will be the first name ' called. Benske is said to be in Europe. He is out on his personal bond, which j will probably be defaulted. George M. ; Bur-batik will also be looked for in vain. i He rests under an indictment for jury ; bribery, and his bend was defaulted | April 2. Hans Ansland, a partner of George Johnson, who went up for ninety days for petit larceny a few days ago, is under indictment for grand larceny in the second degree. His bond was also defaulted Nov. 14. William Lynch, burglary in the third degree, is next on the list. He is in dicted for the same offense jointly with Thomas Day, and both are out on bail. An old standing case against Charles Daly will be called, in which the bond was defaulted June 5. Next on the call is the grand larceny case against E. D. N. Whitney and D. L. Savage, the real estate brokers, which has been twice continued, and will be more than usually interesting. The parties are accused of sharp prac tice in selling bank stock for an old gentleman by the name of Mattison. Alexander Drinkwater's name will be called on his indictment for grand larceny. Drinkwater is out on bail. Also Edward R. Harroun, the ex-poli tician from Ramsey county, who will be called on a charge of forgery in the second degree. There are two grand larceny cases against Frank H. Anson, of Excelsior, and one against Kevi Goldblum, the insolvent North Side merchant, charged with obtaining . goods from Wyman, Partridge & Co., while to his own- knowledge he was insolvent. Charles H. Ferguson will be tried on th? indictment by the last grand jury for grand larceny. Theodore Cerpen ski, for burglary, Charles Konola for assault in the third degree. Frank Johnson, Samuel E. Pumpelly, and 'Ernst A. Wyberg will be tried under a joint indictment for robbery in the first d'gree. Christian Knaoss being the complaining witness. Pumpelly is out on bail, but the other two are bid ing their time in jail. Louis Seaman will be tried for offer ing a bribe to a witness. Harry Hazel, the clairvoyant, has a case against him of grand larceny in the first degree, and Walter Fewer is in jail awaiting trial for assault in the first degree on two counts. Two cases were put on the calendar yesterday: Daniel Berndgrcn for driv ingaway a horse without authority, and Otis New, who plead not guilty to a charge of assault in the third degree, and will appear again today. THE FATTED CALF. It Is the Subject of a Hoard of Trade Discussion. Yesterday morning the board of trade gave the question of local stock feeding another airing, "he matter was placed before the board by Dr. C. J. Alloway. of the IP *> stock com mittee. He endeavored to show how Minneapolis was the natural point for the establishment of a great stock feeding industry. It was located in the center of the flax region, and oil cakes was considered one of the best ma terials for the fattening of stock. The feed could here be had at a price many times lower than that charged in Chi cago. Yet almost all stock was trans ported to the latter city and fattened there. The reason was that the local banks did not want to advance money to cattle raisers. This was generally done in Chicago, where the banks con sidered the stock itself as good se curity. Dr. Alloway advocated the holding of a fat stock show in this city for the purpose of showing what results could be obtained. The ques tion was referred to the committee on live stock. A copy of the call for the insurance convention was read by O. B. Clark. The convention will be held at the board of trade rooms on the forenoon of Dec. 17. Two thousand invitations will be sent out. Nilson Williams offered a resolution calling for an investigation of the feasibility of turning the old court house into a market. PEACE IN COMPANY A. Corporal Pearse Elected First Lieutenant. Company A put an end to the late unpleasantness ilast night by electing ■ Corporal Roy earse first lieutenant. | The McWade men, foiled for the third \ time in the man of their choice, com- I bined on one of his supporters and ' elected him, showing about the same strength that McWade had polled all along. Lieut. Col. Bronson, of Stillwater, came over expressly to preside at the election, which passed off very quietly. There were no nomination speeches, but before taking a vote Sergt. Moffet withdrew his name in favor of Sergt. Fruen, who was MsWade's opponent at the last election. Both were candi- j dates of the anti-Wade men, and by a previous agreement the man who I showed the least strength withdrew i and united the forces. The informal 1 ballot resulted: Pearse, 26, Fruen 25. On the formal ballot Pearse had 29 and Fruen 22, and on the motion of Sergt. Fruen it was made unanimous. The new lieutenant has a three years' record in the company, having enlisted Jan. 9, 1893. He was made a corporal Oct. 12, 1894. and last summer at camp acted as sergeant major of the Minne apolis battalion. He is a bookkeeper for Goodnow & Lawther, and a popu lar young man. THE 

LIBRARY SALARIES. The Board Paves the Way for a Redaction. The regular monthly meeting of the library board was held yesterday af ternoon. The actions taken were few in number and insignificant in appear ance; much talk was indulged in, and, seemingly, little or nothing was ac complished. Yet, to many, that meet ing may prove of great importance. It inaugurated measures which may lead either to a general or radical reduction of salaries, or, at least, to a readjust ment of the salary system of the board. A. committee to investigate the matter will be appointed by President Walker within the near future. What started the ball rolling in such a direction was a few words from Librarian Hosmer, asking that atten tion be paid to the fact that Miss Pratt, now in charge of the juvenile department, was paid a salary that must be deemed unreasonably small when the work done by her was taken into consideration. She has been in the employ of the board for more than a year and lias previously served as ap prentice for close to another year. Yet she has only been paid $20 a month. All members present admitted that such a remuneration was too small, but while the majority wanted to give -Mlfs Pratt a raise or 510 a mon-tn, r.. M. Johnson fought hard to have her salary raised to $35 or $40. He stated that other employes of the board were paid much more, although they had not served longer nor were doing more efficient work than Miss Pratt. This statement gave the debate a danger ous twist. A recent report .of the fi nance committee, recommending a cut all along the line, was brought Unto the discussion. When the report was read, It had been voted to lay on the table until a full board was present, which virtually meant Indefinite post ponement. Chairman Cameron, of I that committee, moved that a special ' committee be appointed to take steps 1 tending to a readjustment, instead of I a reduction of the salaries. The motion was eventually passed j unanimously, but President Walker i refrained for the time being to name ! the three members of the committee. j In connection with this vote another 1 one was taken on the salary of Miss ! Pratt, with the result that it was fixed I at $30 a month. I The pay roll for the month of- No ; vem her was passed and warrants or. i der d drawn. At the same time ar j rangements were made to have ' the 1 pay roll for December passed by the j president and the secretary on such '■ time that the employes can lift their ! December salaries before Christmas. II UK!. 

SENT IP. Sentenced to Three Years in the 'Penitentiary.. Judge Russell yesterday sentenced George Baird to three years at hard I labor, at Stillwater. Baird was unkempt and looked j wretched enough a*3 he stepped up to j the clerk's desk to plead to the indict i ment. : He was charged with stealing. ■ a bicycle from the Snow cycle house, I First avenue south. Sept. 13. He plead-, I ed guilty readily enough, and the rea son became - apparent when the court was informed that there were other charges against him pending the action of the grand jury. Baird confessed to having been sen tenced to the reformatory in Wisconsin for stealing, -but stated that the occa sion of his downfall was drink, to which he had been addicted. "Your honor," said he, "may I have a word with you in private?" . Judge Russell turned the man over to Assistant County Attorney Stilson. Beardsley, who talked with him a mo ment. When he returned to the clerk's desk. Baird said, in reply to the court's question as to whether he had anything to say why the sentence of the court should not be passed upon upon him, that he had been employed in the North Star Shoe company's works. At noon one day he was invited to dinner by the folks "who lived in the rear of the building. They had beer and invited him to drink. That was. the beginning of his downfall. They were in the chicken stealing business, too, he said. "Who are they?" asked the court. "Why, it's Mr. Green and his family." Baird gave his age as twenty-one and said that he was a barber by trade, having worked at that for two years. He was sentenced by the court and taken to water in the afternoon. NEW COMMISSIONER. F.G. McMillan Chosen by the Park *.:;:-•*-■ Board. t Late in its session yesterday the park board took up the election of a suc cessor to the late Baldwin Brown. F. G. McMillan was chosen on the thirty seventh ballot. Supt. Berry reported that skating rinks had been opened at Van Cleve and Loring parks and on Minnehaha creek, near the falls. Byron Wolver ton laid a claim -to. about 700 feet of Lake Harriet lake shore, for which he offered to give a quit claim, deed for a consideration. If not. he would erect a pavilion and run a rival attraction. Attorney Rockwood gave it as* his opinion that Wolverton had no legal claim. - '■■-'■- ' - Frank Griggs McMillan, the new member of the park board, was born in 1856 at Danville. Vt. His first pro fession was that of a printer, and in such capacity he was connected with several of the local papers after his removal to this city in 1878. Poor health caused him to look for another trade He then became a carpenter, and later a millwright. Gradually he commenced to do business as a con tractor. At the present moment he has established a thriving business of that kind having built a number of .the best residences in this city. In 1890 he was elected state senator from the Second and Ninth wards of Minneapo lis. He . served during the terms of 1891 and 1893, doing good work and be ing honored with several Important committee positions. Commissioner McMillan has always belonged- to the Democratic party, as did before him his father. Col. Andrew McMillan, of Vermont. He has taken great inter est in the work of the Hennepin County Democratic league and the State Democratic association, and has served as an officer of both these or ganizations. His election yesterday afternoon was received with great sat isfaction by all the members of the park board. 

THREE GO TO ST. PETER. Tito Men and a Young Russian Girl Unfortunate. Three unfortunates were committed to the asylum at St- Peter yesterday, after an examination in the probate court. John Virosky, a native of Si beria, had insanity of the violent type. He was anxious to fight, and wanted to go to Cuba with dynamite bombs. He was also anxious to take the life of his late sovereign, the czar. William Harris, an intelligent man about thirty years old, wanted to go to St. Peter for a month or two-. Some doctors at Independence, 10., had given him medicine which hurt his mind, and once in a while something clicking in his headi started it off in the wrong di rection. The doctors agreed that it must be wheels, and gave him the de- sired commitment. The third case was a most distressing one. a Russian girl, apparently about sixteen years old, who had been em ployed as a domestic at 521 Seventh avenue north. Her body was covered with filthy rags, which Mrs. Wood burn, the night matron, had to tear away. The girl made a stout resist ance, and was with difficulty led from the jail to the court house. She re fused to give her name, pleading that she could not speak English. Trixy Pleaded Guilty. Trixy Horton and her companion were arraigned in municipal court yes terday, on a charge of being loose char acters, pleaded' guilty and were fined $25 each. The proprietor of the house where the girls boarded was served with a warrant charging him with keep ing a house of ill fame. His name is James Bishop and he has been con victed several times on similar charges. Former Minneapolitan Dead. B. E. Messer, one of the pioneers of Minneapolis, died on Monday last at his home, near Washington, aged eighty four years. He was well known and greatly respected by the early settlers as an accomplished teacher and in dustrious mechanic and a public officer. He came to St. Anthony in 1832, crossed the river to Minneapolis in 1853, where he lived until 1862. Holbrook Breaks a. Record. The Minneapolis postoffice has estab lished another record for itself. Last month it rolled up the largest receipts it has yet had during any November and in addition scored a gain of over 20 per cent over last November by plac ing the figures at $44,239.39 __ against 1 $36,909,83 for a year ag*.

" ] All the s- nate galleries, < public and private were filled to overflowing and the outer. corridors were crowded with those unable to gain admission. When the senators began to gather early in the day* there were warm greetings and renewal of acquaintances. Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, and Mr. Teller, of Colorado, were among " the ' first ar rivals. They were soon joined by the venerable Senator Hoar and his Mas sachusetts coll- ague. Mr. Lodge, Mr. Peffer . and Mr. Allen showed special attention to the acquisitions to the Populist senatorial ranks.

SEVEN DIFFERENT DEADLY POI - SONS— A SI RE AND CERTAIN : ANTIDOTE. The poison of the rattle snake is no more deadly and venomous than some that we make in our bodies. Ptoma i n c s are the pois ons generated in the body It self and their deadly quali ties are like those of stryc h n i n c, arsenic, mor phine, etc. The details of numerous murder trials and text bocks on Toxicology teach us these facts. Then there are the poisons that re sult from imperfect digestion of our food. From only partial oxydation of the blood elements. From the waste and breaking down of our muscles, bones, . brains and nerves. Besides these are the disease germs of Typhus, Typhoid, Scarlet Fever, Grippe, Small Pox, Malaria, Diphthe ria and the like. The very air we breathe is full of these germs. The water we drink teems with myr iads of them. We are beset from within and with out, and as if not content with all this, we ourselves add nicotine and al cohol to the deadly list. What Is it then that prevents our sickening and dying from all these poisons? Our Kidneys. They are the scavengers and sewers of the body.

Kmrte Nelson was " today escorted to the vice, president's desk by Senator Davis and received the oath of office. He Is In excellent health and' was warmly greeted by many senators who formerly served with him In the house of j representatives. In the drawing for seats In the house today the Minnesota congressmen were not fortunate in se curing contiguous . seats. It Is gener ally regarded as desirable for congress . men to secure seats near their state colleagues, In order that quick com munication can be had when matters affecting their states are pending. Johnson, of North Dakota, was the first Northwestern member to have a choice. He selected a seat in the sec ond row in front of the speaker's desk. Representative Tawney came next and selected the seat next to Boutelle, of Maine, near Speaker Reed's old seat. -Representative Fletcher was called early In the list and took a seat in the j second row In front of the speaker. A j handsome floral piece was immediately sent to his desk bearing the card of j the secretary of the National Associa j tion of Postoffice Clerks. Representa tive Heatwole selected a seat in. the '■ rear of the house next to the last row, but within easy range of the speaker's : eye. McCleary and Klefer, as was also the case last year, were low down on the list, and did not have much choice of seats. This was also the case with Eddy and Towne. 

REPUBLICAN SENATORS. They Want to .Reorganize, hut • ! Cannot Act Harmoniously. - - WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.— The Repub lican' senators were in caucus for half 'an hour after the senate adjourned-to ! day, but adjourned until Wednesday | without taking any action on the reor- I ganization of the senate. Mr. Sherman was elected chairman of the caucus, , and Mr. Dubois secretary. The discus sion was informal and centered around ' the question whether the Republican senators, having a plurality but no ma * jority of the senate, should attempt a reorganization with Republican officers and the Republican chairmen of com mittees. It was evident that the pre vailing sentiment favored Republican organization, and some strong speeches were made, notably by Mr. Davis, of Minnesota, and Mr. Aldrich, of Rhode Island, urging that there should be no combination or compromise with any element outside the Republican ranks. This appeared to voice the general view of senators and no opposition speeches were made. The question arose, how ever, as to whether the test of strength should be made on securing the com mittees or on the choice of a president pro tempore. In order to present this issue Mr. Hoar moved the appointment of committee on committees to have general charge of a move to secure committee reorganization on Republic an lines. Mr. Hale offered an amend ment for 1 a test on the choice of presi dent pro tern. In the informal dis cussion following Mr. Frye's name was mentioned as the probable candidate for president pro tern. Some senators raised the point, however, that the president pro tern could not be elected while the presiding officer was present and acting under the senate rules. It was finally decided that no vote should be taken at present and Messrs. Hoar and Hale withdrew their motions. The understanding was that a definite line of action would be agreed upon at the meeting Wednesday following the ses sion of that day. The principal reason for the with drawal of the resolution for the ap pointment of a caucus committee by the chair was the discovery of the fact that there .was a large element in the caucus opposed to the selection of the committee by- appointment. It is now understood that when the resolution is renewed it will be antagonized by a substitute providing for the election of the committee by the caucus. ;-7r: . Senator Faulkner, of West Virginia, : said today concerning the organization i of the senate: "We cannot turn the i senate over to the Republicans until i they, have the votes. Even with the ' two senators from Utah they will not have a majority. unless Nevada votes with them, which is expected. Until that time we will have to continue in control." ?250,000 FOR ST.

IXCREASIXG THE REVENUES. Minnesota Congressmen Tell How • It Should Be Done. WASHINGTON, Dec. Several members of the Northwestern dele gation have been interviewed regard ing their opinions as to the best j method this congress can pursue to j increase the revenues sufficiently to i meet the running expenses of the i government. The Minnesota men spoke as follows: Mr. Tawney— l think that the most available proposition at the present time is to authorize the issuance of short term certificates of indebtedness. This would bring immediate relief. We could then take up the subject of the I tariff. lam not in favor of any in crease of internal revenue taxation. Mr. McCleary— We should increase : the revenue and, decrease the expenses. i We can increase the revenue by putting ; a larger duty on barley, flax, butter and I eggs -and other farm products. Bills I along that line should be Introduced I and so framed as to meet the approval , of the president, if possible. Mr. Heatwole— l think that whatever I revenues are needed should be raised ' from tariff on imports, and the amend . ment of certain schedules in the present law would prove sufficient. Mr. Kiefer— should amend the j present tariff law so as to increase the revenue on Imports sufficient to meet the deficiency. Mr. Towne— l believe that the needed revenue should be raised by in_c_ising 1 the customs duties. I am especially in j favor of increasing the duties on wool and other farm products. Mr. Eddy— We need immediate relief, ; and I would not undertake to say what lesrislatlon would provide that relief. It' might bo practicable to raise the revenue from an increased tax on beer.
