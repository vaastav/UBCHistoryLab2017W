The correspondent of the Daily Telegraph at St. Petersburg n a dispatch dated Dec. 10, eent by way " Kj'dtkuhnen, East Prussia, sends an interview with Count Witte, in which the premier indicates that Russia is con fronted with the alternative of a revolu tion or violent coercion Though the count lias not abandoned hope, he is not sanguine, nd if forcible repression should become necessary he will, according to the , correspondent, resign his task to other hands. Questioned by the corcrsjtondent as to the genesis of the revolutionary movement, Premier Witt attributed its rapid development to the great auton omy of the universities and the high schools, where the revolutionary forces, hitherto doomed to secrecy, found asy lum and sanctuary and absolute freedom for discussion. Further, when this free dom became license,- society still looked on with stolid in li (Terence. After reviewing the situation up to the manifesto uT Oct. 30, Count Witte said: ' "Cletyrty the vast changes which the v, .fWHffesto heralded required time and pa tience to carry out j but what happened was utterly unexpected. Sections of the community nay, whole classes went to work systemmatically to anni hilate their own means of livelihood and to ruin themselves and the whole nation, Social jmstinets seemed to have became atrophied. Instead of uniting to pre serve order, the people quarreled among themselves and attacked the government. "The only people who acted in their own interests were the revolutionists. They knew what they wanted. They chose the most effective means to attain it, and they are capable of adopting those means even at the price of heavy sacnlices. REJECTS THE PROPOSAL.
