LONG LIST OF DEFICIENCIES. Itfsry Mo««* Hriuga Mass UsSis sort —Cleveland'» tslm VI« w.. Washington, Dec 3 —The message of President Cleveland to the members of the second session of the Fifty-third congress was read In the houae by Clerk Kerr and In the senate by Secretary Cox. The reading began at t :30 and con sumed about two hour*. Following Is the message In full: Ml «sags to the congress of the United Statea: The assemblage within the nation'! legislative hall of those charged with the duty' of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free people. Impress Ively suggests the exacting obligation and Inexorable responsibility tnvi Ived In their task. At the threshold of nuct. labor now to be undertaken by th< of the United States and In tin cong «•■charge of an executive duty enjoin»: by the constitution. I submit this com munlcatkm, containing a brief state ment of the constitution of our national affairs and recommending such legisla tion as seems to me necessary and ex pedient. The history of our recent dealing* with other nations, and our peaceful re ■ lotions with them at this time, addi tionally demonsfrates the advantage ul consistently adhering to a firm but Just foreign policy, free from envious or am bitious national schemes and character ized by entire bonesty and sincerity. During the past year, pursuant to a law of congress, commissioners were ap pointed to the Antwerp Industrial Ex position. Although the participation ol American exhibitors fell far short ol completely Illustrating our national In genuity and Industrial achievements, yet It waa still creditable, In view of thi brief time allowed for preparation. I have endeavored to Impress upon the Belgian government the needlessnea* and positive harmfulness of its restric tions upon the Importation of certain of our products and have strongly urge«; that the rigid supervision and Inspec tion under our laws are amply sufficient to prevent the exportation from thU country of diseased cattle and unwhole I j some meat. 

BRAZILIAN MATTERS. The termination of the civil war In 'Brasil has been followed by genera) prevalence of peace and order. It ap pearing at an early stage of the Insur recUon that Its course would call for unusual watchfulness on the part of this government, nur naval force In the harbor of Rio de Janeiro was strength ened. This precaution I am satisfied tended to restrict the Issue to a sim ple trial of strength between the Bra zilian government and the Insurgents, and to avert tmmplications which at times seemed Imminent. Our firm at titude of neutrality was maintained to the end. The Insurgents rwelved the encouragement of an eventual asylum from our commanders and such opposi tion as they encountered was for the protection of our commerce and wa* clearly Justified by public law. A serious tension of relations hav lng arisen at the close of the war be tween Brasil and Portugal by reason of the escape of the Insurgent Admiral Da Gama and his followers, the friend ly offices of our representative» to there countries were* m*rel««l for the protection of the subjects of either with in the territory of the other. Although the government of Brazil was duly noUfled that the commercial arrangement existing between the United Htates and that country, based on the third section of the tariff act of 1890, wss abrogated on August 2*. 1894. by the taking effect of the tariff law In fore«, that government subse«|uenUy notified the United States of Its tnten tton to terminate »uch an arrangement on tha first day of January. 1896. in the exercise of the right reserved In the agreement between the two countrle». I Invite attention to the correspondence between the secretary of state and the Brasilian minister on this subject. The commission organized under the ronventlon which we had entered into with Chile for the settlement of the out standing claims of each government against the other, adjourned at the end of the period stipulated for it* contin uance. leaving undetermined a number of American cases, which had been duly presented. Throe claims are not barred, and negotiations are In progrès* for their submission to a tribunal the 17th of March next. RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND JAPAN Friendly Office* of Onr Government to Effect Peace. The new treaty with China wa« signed at Washington and on August IS it received the sanction of the sénat«*. Ratification on the pari of China and a formal exchange are awaited to give effect to this mutually bénéficiai con vention. A gratifying recognition of the uni form impartiality of this country tow ards all foreign states was manifested by the coincident request of the Chin ese and Japan«««- governments that the agents of tbe United Htates should, within the proper limit, afford protec tion to the subjects of the other, dur ing the suspension at diploma tic rela tions due to a state of war. This deli cate office was aecept«-d and a misap prehension which gave rise to the belief that in affording this kindly unofficial proi«M;tlnn «»nr agents would exercise me authority which the wlth 0 drawn agents of the belligerents had ti eroissd waa promptly corrected Although the war between China and Japan Indorse-» no policy of the tinn ed States, It deserve» our gravent con sidération by reason of Its disturbance of our growing commercial Interests in the two countries and the increased dancers which may result to öur citi zen* domiciled or sojourning In the in terior of China. Acting under a stipula tion In our treaty with Corea (the Bret concluded with a western power), I feit constrained at the beginning of the controversy to lender our good offices to induce an amicable arrangement of the Initial difficulty growing out of the Japanern- demands for administrative reform in Corea, but the unhappy pre cipitation of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose, destructive war between the two most powerful of the eastern nations and anxious that our commercial interests In the countries may be preserved am that the safety of our citlsena there shall not be Jeopardised. I would not hesitate to heed any intimation that ous friendly aid for the honorable ter mination of hoatllitlea would be ac ceptable to both belligerents. OTHER RELATIONS. A convention has been Anally con cluded for the settlement by arbitra tion of the prolonged dispute'with Ec uador. growing out of the proceedings agalnat Emllto Santos, a naturalised citizen of the United Htates. Deploring the t In EXTENSIVE FOREIGN RELATIONS. ttawali. Mexico, Nicaragua and Other Nations Touched I pon. Since communicating the voluminous "orrespondence In r«!gard to Hawaii and ihe action taken by the senate and houae of representatives on certain questions submitted to the Judgment and wider discretion of congress, the organization of a government In place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen has twen announced, with evidence of Its effective operation. The recognition us ual In suc-hcaae* has been accorded the new government. Under the present treatise of extradi tion with Italy, miscarriages of Justice have* occurred, owing to the refusal ■ >r that government to surrender Its -*wn subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended convention obvi ating this difficulty have been unavail ing. Apart from the war In which the ial ;nd empire Is engaged. Japan attract» Increasing attention iu this country t>y her evident desire to cultivate more liberal Intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid In furtherance of her tlomesUc affairs and full equality tn the family of nations. The Japanese empire of today Is no longer the Japan of the past and our relations with thi* progressive nation should he mi less broad and liberal than those with other flowers. 

WITH MEXICO. Good will, fostered by many Internats in common, bas marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbors Peace being restored along her north ern frontier. Mexico has asked the pun lshment of the late disturbers of hei tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the In tercourse between the two countrlro Is attested by the fact that during this long period the commerce of each has steadily Increased under the rule of mutual consideration, neither tying stimulated by conventional arrange ments or retarded by Jealous rivalries or selfish distrust. An Indemnity tendered by Mexico a» a gracious act for the murder In 1887 of Lem Baldwin, an American citisen. by a band of marauders in Durango, has lM*en accepted anil Is being paid in tnstai!m«-nta. The problem of the storage and use of the waters of the Rio Grande tor Irrigation should be solved by appro priate concurrent action of the two interested nations. Rising in the Col orado heights, the stream flows inter mittently. yielding little water during ihe dry months to the irrigating chan nels already constructed along Its course. This scarcity Is often felt In the réglons where tbr river forms a common boundary. Moreover the fre quent changes In Its course through level lands often raise embarrassing pirotion* of territorial Jurisdiction. HLUF.FIELDB INCIDENT Prominent among the questions «if the year was the Bluefleltla Incident. In what Is known aa the Mosquito Indian strip, bordering on the Atlantic ocean and within the Jurisdiction of Nicar agua. By the treaty of 1860 between Great Britain and Nicaragua, the form er government recognised the sover eignty of the latter over the strip and a limited form of self government was guarante«>d to the Mosquito Indians to be exercised according to their custom for themselves and other dwellers with in Its limits. The so-called native gov ernment. which grew to be largely made up of aliens, for many years dis puted the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the right to maintain therein a practically Inde pendent municipal government. Early In the past year the efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mos quito territory h-d to serious disturb ances. culminating In the suppression of the native government and the at tempted substitution of an Impractica ble composite administration. In which Nicaragua and the alien residents were to participate. Failure was fol lowed by an Insurrection, which for a time subverted Nicaragua's rule, ex pelling her officere. and restoring the old organization. This In turn gave place to the existing lo«*al government, established and upheld by Nicaragua. Although the alien Interests arraigned ttgalnsDNlearagua In these transactions have been largely American, and the commente of that region for some time has been and still la chiefly controlled by our citlsena. we cannot for that rea son challenge the rightful sovereignty of Nicaragua over this Important part of her domain. Far some months be fore and during part of the time two of our naval «hip* have been stationed at Blueflelda for the protection of all legit imate Interests of our etttaene In Kepterober last the government at Managua expelled from Ha territory 12 or more foreigners, including two Amer icans. for alleged participation in the seditious or (evolutionary movements against the republic at Hiuefields al ready mentioned, but through the earn est remonstrance of this government. ly of ily be a on of I the Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management at their b usine»» Our naval commanders at the scene of these disturbance» by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment, contributed large ly to the prevention of more serious sequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. I regret that In the midst of these currences there happened a moat grave and Irritating failure of Nicaragua Ju* tloe. An American citisen named Wll aon, residing at Rama, tn the Musquito territory, waa murdered by one Ar guello, the acting governor of the town. After some delay, the murderer was arrested, but was so insecurely con fined or guarded that he escaped, and. notwithstanding our repeated demands. It la claimed that his recapture has been impossible by reason of his (light beyond Nicaraguan Jurisdiction. The Nicaraguan authorities, having given notice of the forfeiture of the con cession to the canal company on grounds purely technical and not embraced In the contract, have receded from that position. no con ..1 

SYMPATHY FOR PERU. Peru. I regret to say. shows symp toms of domestic disturbances, due probably to the slowness of her recuper ation from the distresses of the war of 1881. Weakened In resources, her diffi culties In framing International obli gations invite our kindly sympathy and Justly our forbearanec long-pending claims. I have felt strained to testify this sympathy In connection with certain demands gently preferred by other powers. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. The recent death of the esar of Rus sia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government, with hla bereaved fam ily and the Russian people Aa a furth er demonstration of reciprocal friend ship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies The sealing Interests of Russia In Hering sea are second only to our A modus vivendi was therefore eluded with the Imperial government restrictive of poaching on the Russian rookeries and of sealing In waters which were not comprehended in the protected area defined In Ihe Paris award. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian government equality at treatment for our great life Insurance companies, whose o|>eratlona have been extended throughout Europe. Admit ting, as we do. foreign cor|>orattons to transact buslneas In the United Statea. we naturally expect no less tolerance for our own Interests In ample fields of competition abroad. But few cases of Interference with naturalized citizens returning to Rus sia have been reported during the cur t ent year. One Klslmlnakl waa arrested last summer In a Polish province on a reported charge of un permitted renun ciation or Russian allegiance, but it transpired that the proceedings origin ated alleged malfeasance committed by him while an imperial officer a number of years ago. Efforts for hla release, which promised to be successful. Were In progress when his death was re ported. of of ly In val out A do ent the go In pressing con ur own. eon the THE EZETA CASE.

In Com pliance with the terms of Ute treaty. On their arrival at San Francisco such a proreedlhg was promptly Instituted before the United States district Judge, who held that the acts constituting the alleged offenses were political, and dls charg«*«l all of the accused except one Clenfuegoa. who was held for an at tempt to murder.

The unreasonable and unjust fines Imposed by Spain on the vessel» and commerce of the United Statea have de manded from time to time during the last 20 years an earnest remonstrance on the part of our government. In the Immediate past exorbitant penalties have been Imposed upon our v and goods by the customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical er rors of the most trivial character In th«- manifests or bills of lading. In some cases fines amounting to thous ands of dollar» have been levied upon the cargoes or the carrying v Ihe goods In question were entlUed to free entry; fines have been exacted even when error has been detected and the Spanish authorities notified before the arrival of the goods In port. Tbl« conduct te In strange contrast with the considerate and liberal treatment ex tended to the Spanish vessels and car goes In our porta In like cases. No sat •afactory settlement of there vexatious questions ha» been yet reached. Tbe Mora case, referred to tn my test annual message, remains unsettled. From tbe diplomatic correspondence on this subject, which has been laid before the senate it wiHhereenthatthtegovern ment has offered to conclude a conven tion with Spain far disposal by arbitra tion or outstanding claims between the two countries, except the Mora claim, which, having long ago been adjusted, now only awaits permits as stipulated, and of course It could not b» Included in the proposed convention. It waa hoped that this offer would remove the parlia mentary obstacles encountered by the Spanish government tn providing pay ment of the Mora indemnity.

In my last annual message I adverted to the claim on the part of Turkey of the right to expel aa persons undesira ble and dangerous. Armenians natural ised tn the United States and returning to Turkish Jurisdiction. Numerous questions la this relation have arisen. While thi* government acquiesces In the asserted right of expulsion it would not consent that Armenians may be Imprisoned or otherwise punished for no other reason than having acquired without Imperial consent American cltl xenehlp. Three of the assailants of Mias Molton, an American teacher I» Mos aul. have been convicted by the Otto man courts, and I am advised that an appeal against the scqulttal of the re maining five has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officer. CONVENTION WITH VENEZUELA A ctnvsntion has been concluded with Venesuela for the arbitration of a long disputed claim growing out of the aeln ure of certain vessels, the property of citizens of the United States. Although signed, the treaty of extradition with Venesuela la not yet In force, owing to the Insistence of that government that, when surrendered.

In Io at of id of ing of fine the 757 Combined Military' Fore* Necessary to Preserve Peace In my last annual message, I referred briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty aa signally Illus trating the Impolicy of entangling al liances with foreign powers, and on May 9. 1894. in response to a resolution of the senate, I sent a special message and document to that body on the same subject, which emphasised my previous ly expressed opinions. Later occur rences and correspondence In regard to them, which will lie laid before con gress, further demonstrates that the government which was devised by the three powers and farced upon them against their inveterate hostility, can be maintained only by the continued presence of military fore«* and at no sipall sacrifice of life and treasure.

A few days later. Tamasese and his adherents, fearing the ships and the marines, professed submission. The re ports received from our agent at Apia do not Justify the belief that the thus brought about will be of long du ration.

The Presldcat Speak» of Ccatrallilng 1 1 imp« at Big Poets. From the report of the secretary of war. it a pear» that the strength of the army on September 10, 1894. waa 2,135 officers and 26,7*6 enlisted men. Al though this te apparently a very »light decrease compared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been increased to the equivalent of nearly two regiments through the reorganis ation of the system of recruiting and the «xmsequent release to regimental duty of a large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting depots. The abolition of there depots. It te predict ed. will furthermore effect an annual reduction approximating *216.600 In the direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, morals and disci pline of the troops. CENTRALIZE THE TROOPS. The execution of the policy of con centrating the army at Important cen tre» of population and transportation, foreshadowed In the last annual report of the secretary, has resulted tn the aliandopment of 16 of the smaller posts, which was effected under a plan which assembled tbe organisation» of the aame regiment» hitherto widely sepa rated. ThU renders our small force more readily effective for any service which they may be called upon to per form: Increases the extent of territory j under protection without diminishing * the security heretofore afforded to any | , . ... _ • h ™ u » h •*** of *" ' "»'J* ,hr * mhl, ' oa * or lnt *"* U ol ! toc »** u **- , of locality: Improves the discipline, train ing and esprit de corps of the array, beside* considerably decreasing the nwt of Its maintenance. Though the forces of th# Department of the East .have been somewhat In creased. more than three-fourths of the army 1a still stationed west of the Mteolwlppl. This carefully matured policy, which aecures the beat and the greatest service In the Interest of tbe general welfare from the smalt force comprising our regular army, should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary INTERNAL TROUBLES. It ia hardly nerowaary to recait the fact that In obedience to the commands i of the constitution and the law» and as for the purpose of protecting the prop erty of the United States, aiding the proeese of federal courts and removing lawleaa obstructions to the perform ance by the government of Its necessary mate functions. It became neeeeaary In various localities during the year to employ à considerable portion of the regular troops. Their duty was dis charged promptly, courageously and with marked discretion by the officers and men. and the moat gratifying proof waa thus afforded that the army de-, serves that complete confidence tn Its efficiency and discipline which the country has at aU times manifested. The year has been free from disturb ances of Indiana and the chances of further depredations oh their part, are becoming more remote and Improbable. EXPENDITURES. The total expenditures of the war de partment for the year ending June to. 1*M amounted to M4.029.0M.

The appro priations for the current year aggregat ed tK2.42t.112.73 and the estimates sub mitted by the secretary of war for the next fiscal year call for appropriations amounting to t**,S18.*».K. COAST DEFENSE. The skill and industry of our ordnance officers and Inventors have. It la be lieved. overcome the mechanical ob stacles which have heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts. This great national undertaking upon which have entered may now proceed as rap idly as congress shall determine. With a supply of finished guna of large cal ibre already ou hand, to which addi tions should now rapidly follow, the wisdom of providing carriages and em placement for their mount cannot be too strongly urged. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states Is 117.53.7 officers and enlisted men, an Increase or K.343 over the number reported at the close of the previous year. The reports of mi litia Inspections by regular army offi cers show a marked Increase In Interest and efficiency in atate organizations, and I strongly recommend the continu ance of the policy of affording every practical encouragement poaatbie to this Important auxiliary of our military establishment. The condition of the Apache Indians held as prisoners by the government for eight years at a coat of half a mil lion dollars, has been changed during the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity to demon strate thetr capacity for self-support and at least partial civilisation. Legis lation enacted at the late session of congress gave the war department au thority to transfer the survivors, bering 340, from the Mount Vernon par racks tn Alabama to many suitable reservations. The department selected as their home the military lands Fort Bill. Indian territory, where, der military surveillance, the former prisoners have been established In agri culture under to their advancement. In recognition of the long and distin guished military services and faithful discharge of delicate and responsible civil duties by Major Oeneral John M. Schofield, now general commanding the army. It la suggested to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant general In his behalf would be a Just and gracious act. and would permit hla retirement, now near at hand, with a rank befitting hla mérita. of of be the re of 14, of Wi num un conditions favorable a of of of to WHERE Jt'KITCK IN DISPENSED Esdsral Judges, t alon Pacific Keorgsal zatlon and Other Matten. The report of the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme court In overcoming the arrears of Its business and reaching a condition In which It will be able to dispose of the cases as they arise with out any unreasonable delay. This re sult Is, of course, very largely due to the successful working of the plan Inau gurating circuit courts of appeals. In re sprot to these tribunals a suggestion Is made In quarters entitled to the highest consideration that an additional circuit Judge for each circuit would greaUy strengthen theee courts and the confi dence reposed In their adjudications, and that such an addition would not create a greater force of Judges than the Increasing busln requires I commend the suggestion to the careful consideration of congress. Other Important topics are adverted In the report accompanied by recom mendations. many of which have been treated at large In previous messages, and at this time, therefore, need only be named. I refer to the abolition of the fee system as a measure of compensa tion to federal officers: the enlargement of tbe powers of United States commis sioners, at least In the territories; the allowance of writs of error tn criminal caaes on behalf of the United Statee, and the establishment of penalties by congres» in the crime of murder. A topic dealt with by the attorney «serai of much importance la the con dition of the administration of Justice In Indian territory. The permanent so lution of what Is called the Indian problem Is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile, such ameliora tions of present condition» as the exist ing system will admit of ought not to be neglected I am satisfied that there should be a federal court established for the territory with sufficient Judge* and that this court should sit within the territory and have the same Juris diction as to. territorial affairs aa Is now vested In the federal courts sitting In Arkansas and Texas. Another subject of pressing moment referred to by the attorney general la the reorganization of the Union Pa cific Railway Company on a basis equitable as regard» all private Inter ests. and as favorable to the govern ment as existing condition» will permit. The operation of a railway by a «tourt through a receiver is an annoying stale of things which should be terminated on grounds of public and private in terest at the earliest possible moment. Besides, not to enact tbe needed enab ling législation at the present session postpones the whole matter until the assembling of a new congress and in evitably I of the situaUan and could not but be regarded aa a signal failure to sol««* a problem which ha* practically been be of la of auch courte If all of *" ol all tha complications tore the present congress ever rinre Its organisation Eight years ago In my annual mes sag® I urged upon congress aa strongly of of be to of United State« ommendatlon tFM I'M ation of sitae for thaw ta No appropriation has, how» made to carry the act Into etft old and discreditable oondttki It ia not my porpaa* at to repeat the considerations, make an impregnable earn tn f ownership and management by «h» eminent of penal institutions In watch federal prisoners arc confined. 1 simp desire to again urn the former raton mendattons on the subject and to par ticularly call the attention of congre«* to that pan of the report of the aoerw tary of war. in which be statee that the military prison at Fert Leavenworth.
