"T ' A MUk. !-. MBTvlffftwSS'l .J5 4- - ""BBSSW 1 THE ADYEETISER. FAIRBROTHER & HACKER, Publishers. BROWNYJLLE, NEBRASKA THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Washington", December C. Fcilov Citizen of the Senate and Ifctac of Jifp- rettfttatives: I congatulate you on the continued and in creasing prosperity of our country. By the favor of Divine I'rovidence we have been blessed during the past year with health, with abundant harvests, witlfprofitable employment for all our people, and with contentment at home, and with peace and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of the forty fourth election of Chief Magistrate has af forded another opportunity of the people of the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of government from the public sen-ants whose erms of office are about to expire to their newly chosen successors. The example cannot fail to impress profoundly the thoughtful peo ple of other countries with the advantages which the republican institutions afford. The immediate general and cheerful acquisccnce of good citizens in the result of the election, gives gratifying assurance to our country and and to its friends throughout the world that a government based on the free current of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses ele ments of strength, stability and permanency not found in any other form of government. RIGHTS OF THE COLOKEI) CITIZEN. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of citizenship, con ferred ujk)ij the colored people by the recent amendments to the constitution, still prevails in several of the latclae holding states. It has. perhaps, not been manifested in the re cent election to any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots, with the regulations as to thd places and manner of voting and with counting, re turning and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the rights, preservation of all rights the right of sullrage which the constitution expressly confer ujiouour enfranchised -citizens. constitutional amendments. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a lactor m our politics should disappear. They prefer that no section of the country should be uni ted in solid opposition to any other section The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rights amendments to the constitution, is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as tiiese amendments are Hagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the ik'o- ple who placed them in the constitution, as cmltodyiiig the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believes them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act to gether and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is, as to the en joytnentjof the right by every American citi zen who has the rcodisite "qualifications to freely cast his vote and to have it honestly counted. With this question rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the contentions oi the past; i-grnes win lnueeu ne oy-gones, and political and party issues, with respect to the economy and efficiency of administration, internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance, and other import ant subjects will the rect-ive their full share of attention; but resistance to a nullification of the results of the war will unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of the union, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. Jhisdctciiniuation proceeds lrom no hostile sentiment or feeling to airy part of the people of onr country, or to any of their interests. the inviolability oi the amend ments rests upou the fundamental principle of our government, the- are the solemn ex pression of the will of the people of the Uni ted States. The sentiment that the constitu tional rights of our citizens mu-t be main tained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the government of the country. Happily the history of the late election shows that in" many parts of the country where oppo sition to the fifteenth amendment has hereto fore prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether if firm and well considered action it taken by congress. I trust the house of representatives and the senate, will sec to It that every case of violation of the letter or spirit or the lutcenth amendment is thorough ly investigated, and that no benefit from sucli violation shall accrue to any person or party. KIGIITS OF SUFFRAGE. It will be the duty of the cxectitive, with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly nil who have been en gaged in depriving citizens of the rights guar nteed to them by the constitution. It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self protection, which can belong only to a people whose right to universal sullrage is supported by uuiversal education. iopular education. The means at the command of the local and state authorities are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where, before emancipation, the education of the people was sadly neglected, or provided, in the interest of slavery. Firmly conviucc i that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise and com prehensive action by the government of the United States, I rcsiectfuHy recommend that congress, by suitable legislation, and with proper safeguards, supplement the local edu cational funds in the several states, where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship .have been devolved on uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lauds, and, if necessary, by appropriations from the treasury of "the United States, Whatever the government can fairly do to promote free jwpular education, ought, to be done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue, anil social older, prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. In my former annual messages, I have asked the attention of congress to the civil service system of the government My views con cerning the dangers of patronage or appoint ments fur personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience in the executive oliice. and I believe the dangers threaten the stability of the government. Abuses, so serious in tlicir natuie, cannot be tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of the administrative service, as the growth of the country in population increase the number of officers and policemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint ments, promotion and removals establishing a uniform method, having exclusively, in every instance, the attainment of the" best qualifications for the position in question, buch a method alone is consistent with the equal right " of all citizens,, and the most economical and ctlicieut administration of th . public business. ComjHititive examinations, in aid of impartial appointments, have been conduuteil, for some years past, in several of the executive departments; and by my direc tion this system has been adopt ed'in the cus tom houses and post offices of the lamer cities of the country. In the city of New York over two thousand persons in the civil service have been subjected, on their appointments and tenure of place, to the oiK.Tation of published rules for the purpose, during the past two vcars. The results of these practical tests nave been very satisfactory, and have con firmed my ojMiiion iu favor of this svsf em of selection" All are subjected to the tests, and the result is free from prejudice bv personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for the position applied for, the best qualifications at tainat le among the composing applicants. It is an etfectual protection from the pursuit of importunity, which, under any other course pursued, largely exacts the time and attention of appointing ollictjs, to their great detriment in the discharge of other official duties, pre venting the abuse of the .service for the mere furtherance of private or part" purposes, and leaving the employes of the goven ment freed from the obligations imposed by patronage to depend solely upon merit for retention and ajlvanccmcnt,'and, with this eonstantincent- ive, to exertion and improvement, these in valuab'e results have been attained in a high degree in the oihccs wierc the rales lor ap- poiniinent by eompctnne examination have beeu applied." A method which has so approv ed its; If by experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate posi tions under the government I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and enforc ing the highest possible elliciency in the civil service and its protection lrom recognize! abuses, and that the ex- erieuce re erred to has demonstrated the :easibility of suchmeas urcs. The examinations in theVustom homes and postoflices have been l-eld under many embarrassmei.ts and without provision for compensation for the extra J lior performed bv the officers who hsve conducted them, and whose commendable interest in the public ser vice has induced this devot on of time aud la bor without pecuniar' reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be expected, and without appropriation by con cress for compensation, it is not practicable to extend the system of examinations gener ally throughout the civil service. It is also highly important that all such examinations should be c- nducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 1753, of the revised statutes, authotizes the presi dent to prescribe for the regulations for ad mission to the civil service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to "the fi!ness of such candidate, m respect to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability fpr the branch of service into which he seeks to enter;" but the law is prac tically Inoperative for want of the requisite appropriation. I therefore recommend an ap propriation of $25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a commission, to be appointel by the president, fn accordance with the terms ol this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient system of competi tive examinations, and to supervise the appli cation of the same throughout the entire iv II service of the government. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness of those who apply for olhcc, will not only be as welcome a relief to the members of congress as it will be to the president and heads of departments, but that it will greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now inevita bly and constantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between the legislative and executive departments. The most effect ual check upon the perniciom competition of influence and official favoriteism in the be stowal of office will be the sub:-titution of an open competition of merit between the appli 'ants in which ever- one can make his own record with the assuraucethst his success will depend upon this alone. 

POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS OF OFFICE HOLDERS. I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citi zen to express his political opinions and to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as anv private citi zen in the refusal of all demand's upou his sal ary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions against the use of official authority to coerce the polit ical action of private citizens or of official sub ordinates, is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal has been found to be the practice, under what Is known as the SPOILS SYSTEM, by which the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by members of con gress. The first step in the reform of the civil service, must be a complete divorce be tween congress and the executive in the mat ter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that "To the victors belong the spoils," Is in separable from congressional patronage, as the established rule and practice of parties in pow er. It comes to be understood by applicants for office and by the people generally, that representatives and senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective dis tricts and state. It is not necessary to recite at length the evil resulting from this Invasion of the executive functions. The true princi ples of the government on the su'-Jcct of ap pointments to officf, as stated in the national conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American people, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These au thenticated expressions of public opini m upon this all important subject, are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the government Under the con stitution the president and heads of de partments are to make nominations for office, the senate is to advise and consent to the appointments and the house of representatives is to accuse aud prosecute faithless officers. The best in terest of the public service demands that these distinctions be respected; that senators and representatives who may be judges and accus ers should no: dictate appointments to office. To this end the cooperation of the legislative department of the government is required alike by the necessities of the case andb"pub lic examination. Members of congress wil' not be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appointment to oliice until bv legislative enactment, the pernicious practice is condemned and forbidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed defining the relations of the members of con gress with respect to appointments to oliice by the president, and I als recommend that the provisions of section 1707, and of sections fol lowing, of the revised statutes, comprising the tenuieof office act of Mar h 3d, 1SG7, be re pealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil sen-ice in our coun try is one of the higacst and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation of the legislative and executive depaitments of the government, 1 again recommend the whole subject to your considerate attention. THE MORMON QUESTION. It is the iecognlzed duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress polyg amy where it now exists in our territories, and to prevent its extension. Faithful mdzealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it Experience has shown that the legislation upon this EUject to be effective, requires ex tensive modifications and amendment The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Morman sectarian organization, -which up holds poligamy, has the whole power of mak ing and executing the local legislation of the territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries, it possesses large influence over the administraton of justice. Exercising, as the head of the sect do, the local political power of the territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the laws of congress on the subject of poligamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement " Poligamy will not be abolished if enforcement of law depends on those iio practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it The jxiwer of congress to enact suitable laws to protect the territories Is ample. It is u )t a case for half way meas uies. The political iover of the Mormon 6ect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous territories. It is extending steadily into other territories. Wherever It' goes it establishes poligamy ai.d sectarian political jxiwer. The sanctity of marriage and family relations are the comer stone of our American society and civilization, religious liberty, and the separation of church and state ire among the elementary ideas of free institutions. To re-establish the inter ests and principles which poligamy and mor monism have imperiled, and fully re-open to the iutcl.ient au 1 virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part our domain which has been, iu a great degree, closed to general Immigra tion oy the intolerant and immoral institu tion, it is recommended that the government of the territory of Utah be re-organized. A NEW GOVERNMENT FOR UTAH. I recommend congress to provide for the government of Utah by a governorand judges, as commissioners, appointed .by the president and continued by the senate "a government analogous to the provisional government es tablished for the territory of northwest Ohio by the ordinance of 177. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the exist ieg form of local government I recommend that the right to vote, hold oliice, and set on juries, in the territory of Utah, be confined to those who neither" practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that within a few years, the evils which now atllict it will be eradicated, and this territory will, in good time, become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new states of the union. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those o undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipa tion of an early reply fiom the British govern ment t the demand of indemnity to our fish ermen for injuries suffered bv that industry at t orzune uay, in January, i&i!, winch I ex pressed in my last annual message, was disap pointed. Tins answ er was received only In the latter part of April, in the present year, and when received, exhibited a failure of accord betweeu the two governments. As to the measure of the insliore fishing privilege, se cured to our fishermen by the treaty of Wash ington, of so serious a charaete that I made it the subject of a communication to congress, iu which I recommended the adoption of measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this government, in maintenance of the rights accorded to our fishenr.cn uuder the treaty, and towards securing indemnity for the injur- these interests had suffered. A bill to cam-out these recommendations was under consideration by the house of repre sentatives at the time-of the adjournment of congress in June last Within a few weeks I have received a communication from her nia justy's government, renewing cons deration of the subjects, both of indemnity for inju.ies at Fortune bay and of the interpretation of the treaty, in which the previous eorresnondenee had shown the two governments to be at va- riance. Upon loth these topics a disposition toward a mem friendly agreement is manifested bv theiecogmtiou of our right to indemnity for the transaction at Fortune bav, leaving the measure of such indemnity to further confer ence, and by an assent to the view of this go enimentpre-ented in previous correspond ence, that the regulation of conflicting inter ests of shore fishing on the provincial sea coasts, and vessel fishing of our fishermen, should be made the subject of conference aud concurre t arrangements between the two government. I sincerely hope a basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views in the interpreta tion of the "fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which", as the correspondence" be tween the two governments stood at the close of the last session of congress, seemed to be irreconcHnble. ART ANlTrNDUSTRT. In the imtortant exhibition of arts and in dustries which was held last year at Sydney. New South ales, as well as in that now m progress at Mellwurne, the United States have been efficiently and honorable represented. Exhibitors from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, and the participation of the United States was recognized by a special maik of distinction. In the exhibition atMelboume the share taken by our country is no less notable and an equal riifri nf success is confidently expected. The state of tranquility and peace now enjoyed by all the nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. Wc have concluded THE 

FRANCO-AMERICAN TREATT and ratified a convention with the French re public for the settlement of the claims of cit izens of either country against the other. Un der this a commission, presided over by a dis tinguished publicist, appointed in pursuance of the request of boh nations, by his majesty the emperor of Brazil, has been organize 1 and has begun its sessions in this city. A congress to consider means for the protection of indus trial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and in Belgium as delegates. The international commission upon weights and measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your attention to the necessity of an" appropriatira to be made in time to enable this government to comply with its obligations under the metrical conven tion. Our friendly relations with the German empire continue vithout intemiption. PISCATORIAL. At the re ?ent international exhibition of fish and fisheries at Berlin, the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the hasie with which the commission was forced to make its reparations, was extremely success ful and meritorious, winning for the private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class, aud for the country at large the principal prize of houor offere'd bv his majesty the em peror. The results of this great success can not but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. NATURALIZED GERMAN' CITIZENS. There hive been some questions raised be tween the two governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but re t dispatches from our minister at Berlin, sho ! that favorable pro gress is making toward an understanding, in accordance with the views of their govern ment, which makes and admits no distinction whatever between the rights of native and naturalized citizens of the United States. The complaints of molestation by naturalized citi zens abroad never have been fewer than at present. SPAIN AND THE UNITED STATES. There is nothing of importance to note In our unbroken, friendly relations with the gov ernments of Austria, Hungary, Russia, Tur key and Greece. During last summer, several vessels belonging to the Merchant Marine of this country, sailing in nautical waters of the West Indies were fired at, boarded and searched by armed cruisers of the Spanish government The circumstances as reported involve not only the private injury to persons concerned, but all seemed too little observant of the friendly relations existing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remon strance, and the matter is undergoing investi gation by tire royal authorities with a view to such explanation as may be called for by the fact. The commission sitting in this city for adjudation of claims of our citizens against the government of Spain, is, I hope, approach ing the terminations of its labors. The claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with Spain, were submitted to congress for its action at the last session, and I again invite your attention to thfs long-standing question with a view of fina" disposition. At the invitation of the Spanish government a conference has recently beeii held at the citv of Madrid to consider the subjects of the pro tection by loreign powers, oi the NATIVE MOORS in the empire of Morocco. The minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this conference, the result of all the powers represented. The instrument will be laid before the senate for its consideration. The government of the United States has also lost no opportunity to urge upon that of the emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with the humane and enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end to the persecutions which have been so prevalent in that country of persons of a faith other than Moslem, and "especially of the He brew residents of Morocco. CONSULAR TREATY WITH BELGIUM. The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not vet been officially promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the senate of the United States, which occasioned delay, during which the time allowed for rati fication expired. The senate will be asked to extend the period for ratification. The at tempt to negotiate a treaty of extradition with Denmark failed on account of the Danish government failingto insert the usual clause, providing that each nation shouldpav the expenses of the arrest of persons whose ex tradition it asks. TREATIES WITH CHINA AND JAPAN. The provisions ma e by congress at Its last session for the expense of the commission which has been appointed to enter upon ne gotiations with the Imperial government of China, on subjects of great interest to the re lations of the two countries, enabled the com missioner to proceed at once upon their miss-on. The imperial government was prepared to give prompt and ivepeotful attontion to the matters brought under negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such rapidity and success, that on the seventeenth of November last, two treaties were signed at Pekin relat ing to the introduction of Chinese into this country, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trcscot, one of the commissioners, is now on his way home, bringing the treaties, and it is expected they will be received in season to be laid before the senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a con vention for the reciprocal relief of shipwreck ed seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upou congress the propriety of making provision for the erection of suitable fird-proof buildings at the Japanese capital, for the use of the American legation, aud court house and jail connected with" it. The Japanese govern ment, with great generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose a most eligible "piece of land. In my last annual message, I invited the attention of congress in the subject of in demnity funds received some years ago from Chiua and Japan. I renew the recommenda tion then made, that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citizens, should be promptly paid aud the residue re turned to the nations respectively to which they justly and equitably belong. THE 

NETHERLANDS. The extradition treity with the kingdom of the Netherlands, whielfhas been for sometime in course of negotiation, has, during the past year been concluded and ratified. Relations of friendship and amity have beeu established between the government of the United States and that of Roumania, and we nave sent a diplomatic repesentative to Bu charest, and have received at this capital a special envoy, who has been charged by his royal highness, Prince Charles, to announce the independent sovereignty of Roumania. We hope for the speedy development of com mercial relations between the two countries. THE MEXICAN 1IORDER. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet oil tfce bor der between this country and Mexico, would soon become so assured as to justify the mod ification of orders then iu force to our military commanders, in regard to crossing the front ier without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two coun tries. Events proved in accordance with these expecations, and the orders were ac cordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens aud the Mexican govern iuent Subsequently, the peace of the border was again d:sturbeI by a savage baud under the command of Chie'f Victoria, but, by the combined :.nd harmonious action of the mili tary of both countries, his band has been broken up and substantially destroyed. There is reason to believe that the obstacles, which have so long prevented the rapid aud conven ient communication between the United States and Mexico by railway, are on the point of disappearing, and that several im portant enterprises of this charactei will soon be set on foot, which cannot fail to contribute largely to the prop erty of both countries. NEW 

ENVOYS from Guatemala, Columbia, Bolivia, Venezue-J la and Nicarauga have recently arrived at this capuai, wncre distinction and enlightenment afford the best guarantee of the continuance of friendly relations between ourselves and these relative republics. INTER-OCEANIC CANAL PROJECT. The relations between this government and that of the United States of Columbia have engaged public attention duringthe pastvear, mainly by reason of the project of the Inter oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama, x be built by private capital under conces sion from the Columbia government for that purpose. Tiie treaty obligation existing be tween the United "States and Columbia, bv which we guarantee the neutralitv of transit aud sovereignty and property of Columbia in the Isthmus, makes it necessary that the con ditions uuder which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effected, transfonning, as it would, this isthmus 'rom a barrier between the At lantic and Pad 3c oceans, into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the navies and merchantships of the world, should re ceive tne approval oi this government as be ing compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests a the principal power of the western hemisphere. The views which lex pressed in a special message to congress in March last, in relation to the project, I deem it my duty again to press upon vour attention. Subsequent consideration has'but confirmed myopinion"thatit is the right and duty of the united States to assist and maintain such supervision and authority over any inter oceanic canal across the "isthmus that con nects North and South America, as will pro tect our national interest." rEKC. Bolivia avo rnn.T. The war between the .apublic of Chili on one hand and the allied ..-publics of Peru and Bolivia on the other, still continues. This covernment has not felt called upon to interfere in the contest that is within the bel ligerent rights of parties as independent states. We hare, however, always held our selves iu readiness to aid in accommodating their differences, and hav at different times reminded both belligerents of our willingness to render sudi service. Onr good offices in this direction were recently accented bv .ill belligerents; but I regret to announce "that the measures which the ministers of the Uni ted ciaies at cauungu uim uuua were author J ized, to take, with a view to bring about peace, were not a success. In the course of war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all the ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in the protection of American interests. OUR RELATIONS WITH BRAZIL. The relations of the United States with the empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial and their commercial intercourse steadily in creases, to their mutual advantage. The Internal disorders with which the Ar gentine Republic has for some time past been afflicted, and which have more or less influenc ed its external trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may be expected to redound for the benefit of foreign commerce of that republic as well as to the development of its Tast interior resour ces. In the Samoa government King Malietoa, ander support and recognition of the consular representatives of the United States, Great Britain and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquility to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tri-parte local government which has been proposed, the common interests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in their relation to native 'orm of government, and this mav be best secured oy simple diplo matic agreement between them. It would be well if consular jurisdiction of our representa tive at Asia were increased in ex ent and im portance so as to guard American interests in surrounding and outlying lands of Oceanica. The obelisk, CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE, generously presented by the khedive of Egypt, to the city of New York, has -afely arrived II this country and will be erected fn that me tropolis. The commissioner for the liquid ation of the Egyptian debt has lately conclud ed its work, and the government at the ear nest solicitation of the khedive, Lave accedad to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before congress for its information. The commission for the revision of the judicial code of reform lor the tribunal of Egypt is now in session In Cairo. Mr. Farnam, consul general, and J. M. Balcheldon, Esq., have been appointed as commissioners to partake In this work of organization of reform of the tribunal? aud will probably be continued for another period of five years. THE PROPOSED SANITARY CONFERENCE. fn pursuance of an act passed at the last session of congress, invitations had beeu ex tended to the foreign maratime states to join In the saultary conference in Washington, be ginning the first of January". The acceptance of this invitation by many "prominent powers, gives a promise of success in this important measure designed to establish a system of in ternational notification by which the spread of infections or epidemic diseases mav be more effectually checked or prevented. The atten tion of congress is invited to the necessary ap propriationsfor carrying into effect the provi sions of the act referred to. THE NATIONAL COMMERCE. The efforts of the department of state to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United Stites, through the active agency of the con sular officers, and through the dissemination of information obtained from them, has been of unrelaxed interest in these efforts, as de veloped in our commercial communities, and the value of information secured by this means, to trade and the manufacturers of the country, were recognized by congress at its last session, and provision was made for more frequent publication of consular and other reports by the department of state. The first Issue of this publication is now being pre pared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected. 1 lie importance of, and interest attached to, reports of consular officers, are witnessed by the genera! demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed the system of such publications is deserving the approval of congress. A necessary appro priation for its continuance and enlargement, will commend itself to your consideration. OUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRIBS. The prosperous energies of our domestic in dustries and their immense production of sub jects of foreign commerce, Invite, and even require, ac ive development of the wishes and interests of our people in that directiou. Es pecially important is it that our commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, wii h the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, should be direct, and not through the circuit of the European system, and should be carried on in our own bottoms. A full appreciation ef the opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to com merce with Ja jan, China, and the East Indies, with Australia and the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capi tal, a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications of our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct these Impulses to the en largement of our CX 'haiiKPO and of onr carry ing trade, I am sure the wisdom of congress will be ready to supply SUBSIDIES FOR MAIL STEAMERS. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful aud efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that a provision for regular steam postal communication by aid from the government has been the forerunner of the commercial preponderance of Great Britain in all the seas, the greater share iu whose trade is now the desire and intent of our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce have been successful in proportion to their adoption of regular steam postal communica tion with the markets whose trade they sought. jiexico anu tne states oi aoutu America are anxious to receive such postal communication with this country and aid in their develop ment Similar co-operation may be looked for, in due time, from eastern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In respect to foreign com merce quite as much as in Internal trade, pos tal communication seems necessarily a mat ter to demand the attention, and thus pertain ing to the government OUR FOREION COMMERCE AND CARRYING TRADE. I respectfully recommend to your promot attention such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our foreigu co-nmercial exchange and the build ing up of our carrying trade. In this connec tion I Jesire also to suggest the very great service which might be expected In enlarging and facilitating our commerce en the Pacific ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great influence of such means of communication on these routes to navigation in developing aud securing a due share to our Pacific coast in the commerce of the world, needs no illustration or enforcement. It may be, such enterprise, useful and in the end profitable, as it would prove to private invest ment, may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation by congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your careful consideration. And an additiocal.'and not unimportant, although secondary reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable service to the expansion of our commerce, which would be rendered by the frequent cir culation of naval ships in'the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of proper construction and equipment to be of the greatest elliciency in case of maratime war, uugui oe maue constant anu active agents in time of peace, in the advancement and par ticipation of our foreign trade and in the nur ture and discipline of young seamen, who would naturally in some uumbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recog nizing the value to foreign commerce of the active movement of our naal vessels aud the intelligent and patriotic zeal of our naval of ficers to promoting every" interest of their countrymen, is a just subject for national pride. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown by the report of the secretary of the treasury, "is very satisfactory. It i believed the present financial situation of the United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and" value of our re sources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of other country at any period in history. All of our industries are thriving; the rate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed ; vast emigra tion is increasing our population, capital and labor; new enterprises in great numbers are in progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are im roving. REVENUE OF THE GOVERNMENT. The ordinary revenues from all sources, for the ,flscal year ending Juue 30, 1SS0, were (cents being omitted) from customs, $1S6, 522,0G4; from internal revenue, $124,009,373; from sales of public and. $10,110; tax for tax on circulation deposits of naial banks. ti,114,971; for repayment of interest by Pa cific railway companies, $1,707,367; from sink rag fund for Pacific Railway companies, 796,621; from customs " fees, fines, penaltias, &c, Sl,14S,S00: from fees, consular, letters patenta and lands, $2,837,029; fnom proceeds of sale of govern ment property, $232,616; from profit of coin age, etc, $2,792,15; from revenues of the District of Columbia, 1.S09,469; from mis cellaneous sources, $4,099,603; total ordinary receipts, $333,526,610. The ordinray expendi tures for the same period were, for civil ex penses, $15,693,963; for foreign intercourse, -,...,.., ,4 .muiiiuo, ),ij,ii)( ; ior pen s me, including $19,341,022, arrears for pen sions, o6,.ii,l!4; for the military establish ment including river and harbor improve ments and arsenals. $38,116,916; for the naval establishments including vessels, machinery and Improvements at the naw ytjrds, $13,536, vV S mifceUaneous expenditures including public buildings, lighthouse, and collecting thl revenue, $44,535,691; for expenditures on ac count of the District of Columbia, $3,272,3S4; for interest on the public debt, $95. 7575751 for premium on bonds purchased, $2,795,320; iuuai oruinary expenditures $26.,642,957,leav Jng a surplus revenue of f6o,SS3,653,whic i,with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the treasury of $S,0S4,434, making $73,96S,0S7, was applied to the redemption of bonds for the sinking fund of $73,652,900. Of fraction al currency, $251,717; of the loan of 1S5S, 405,000; of the iemporary lora o' $100,000; of bounty land scrip $250,000; of compound interest note?, $165,000,000; of 7-30 notes of 1S64. $520,500; of one and wo year notes $370,000; of old demand notes. $495,000; to'al $73,968,057. The amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,643. There was applied thereunto the sum of $73,904,617, be ing $35973,S73 in excess of the actual require ments, for the year. THE 

AGGREGATE OF REVENUES from all sources during the fiscal year, ended June 30th, 1SS0, was $333,520,610 an Increase over the preceding year of $59,699,420. The receipts thus far of the current year, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to $350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the estimated expen ditures of the year, aud leave a surplus of $90,000,000. It is fortunate this large surplus of revenue occurs at a period when it may be directly applied to the payment of the public debt, which will soou be redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cher ished in the United States than the policy o paying the nation's debt as rapidly as possi ble. THE DEBT OF THE UNITED STATES, with less cash iu the treasury, and exclusive of accruing iii'erest, attaine'd its maximum of $2,756,441,571 in August, 1S65, and has since that time been reduced to $1,SS6,019,504. Of the principal of the debt. S 103,753,100 has been paid since March 1, 1S77, effecting au annual saving of interest of $6,107,593. The burden of the interest has beeu diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of inter est, and the application of the proceeds to the redemption of boudsbearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1S77, is $14,290,453. Within a short period, over $600,000,000 of five and six per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity, not only to fur ther reduce the principal of the debt, but als to reduce the rate of interest on that which yiu remain uupaiu. a can iue aneuuou ui tary of the treasury in his anuual report, and recommend prompt legislation to enable the treasury department to complete the refund ing of the debt which is about to mature. bl'EClE 

PAYMENT8. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to this revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity. The fears that proceeded and ac companied resumption, have proved ground less. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for resump tion, while very large sums of goll bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The increase of coin r notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,399,423. There a'o still in existence, uncancelled, $346,6Sl,0i6 of United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized a? a war measure, made necessarry by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the na tion's existence, required, in the judgment of congress, the issue of legal tender paper mon ey. That it served well the purpose for which it was created is not questioned, but the em ployment of notes as paper monev indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for which they were provided, was not contempla ted by the farmers of the law under which they were issued. These notes long since be came like any other pecuniary obligation of the government, a debt to be paid, and when paid to be cancelled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore repeat ivbat was said in the annual message of last year, that the retirement from circula tion ef'United States notes, with the capacity of legal lender in private contracts, Is a step to be taken in our progress towards a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and" duty of the government and in terest and security of the people. 

SOLVER DOLLAR. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value and giving them legal ten der character, it was believed by many sup porters of the measure that the silver dollar, which it authorized would speedily become, under operations of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were othe supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability of this result, neverthe less were willing to give the proposed experi ment a fair trial witli a view to stop the coin age, if experience should prove that the 6ilver dollar authorized by the bill, continued to be of less commercial value than the standard gold dollar. The coinage of the siver dollar, under the act referred to, began in March, 1S7S and has been continued as required by the act. At the average rate per month to the present time iiasneen 2,27b,492. The to tal amount coined prior to the first of Novem berlast was $72,S47,750. Of this amount $47, 034,450 remain in the treasury, and only $25, 763,291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circulation, and considerable ex pense has been necessarily incurred for the purpose, but its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar, containing 412) grains of silver, has not increased. During'the year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its coinage, the market value of the silver which it contained was from ninety to ninety--wo cents, as com pared with the " standard "gold dollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver dollar has br en SSK cents. It is obvious that the legislation of the last congress, in regard to silver, so far as it was based on the anticipated rise in the value of silver as a re sult of that legislation, has failed to produce the result then predicted. The longer this law remains in force, requiring, as it does, the coinage of the nominal dollar, which, in real ity, is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be forced to ac cept a single metal as the sole legal standard value, In circulation, and this a standard of less value than it purports to be worth in the recognized money of the world. The consti tution of the United States, sound financial principles, aud our best interests, all require that the country shouldhave, as its legal tend er money, both gold and silver coin, of in trinsic value as bullion, equivalent to that, which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The constitution, in express terms, recognizes ijiu gum uuu sihlt as uie oniy true legal tender money. To banish ether of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange, to the disparagement of important interests. The United States produces more silver than anyfother eountry, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals, which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, iu my judgment, contribute to this result if congress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412 grains of silver, and instead will authorize the secre tary of the treasury to coin silver dollar, of the equivalent value, as bullion, with gold dol lars. Tin's will deiraud no man, and willjbe in accordance with'fainiliar precedents. Con gress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver In order to establish it more nea lyin accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two metals. In fi ancial legisla tion every measure In the discretion of greater fidelity in the discharge of securing obligations, has been found by ex perience to diminish the ratio of iuterest, which the debtors are required to pay, and increase the facility with which the .money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidenca in exact performance of monied obligations is established. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The secretary of war reports that the ex penditure of the war department for the fis cal year ended June 30, 15S0. was $39,9 773. The appropriations for this department for the current fiscal year amount to $41,993,630. With respect to the army the secretary invites attention to the fact that its strength is limit ed by statute (section 1115 revised s.atutes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that provisions contained in appropriation bills have limited expenditures to enlistment to 25,000. It is believed the full legal strength is the least possible force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While the enlistment of this force would add some what to the appropriation for the pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than equal to the additional outlay and the efficiency of the army would be large ly increased. The rapid extension of the rail road system west of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of settlers which has poured in upon the new territory, impose on the milita ry an entire change 6f policy. The mainte nance of small posts along the wagon and stage routes of travel is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at pointsselected, of "a more substantial character than those hereto fore constructed will be required under exist ing laws. Permanent buildings cannot be erected without the sanction ofconress, an J when the sale of military sites and buildings has been authorized, the" moneys received re verted to the treasury and could only become available through new appropriation. It is recommended that provision be made by gen eral statute for the sales of such abandoned military posts and buildings as are found un necessary and for the application of the pro ceeds to the construction of otner posts. While many of the present posts are of but light valuefor military purposes owing to the changed condition of the country, their occu pation is continued at great expense and in convenience, because they offer the only avail able shelter for troop. The absence of a large number of officers of line in active duty, from their regiments, is a serious detriment to the maintainance of tLe service. Constant demand for small detae'. meats, each of which should be comminded by a commissioned officer, aud the various du ties of officers for necessary service-away from their commands.- o cawftf a s earftfiin the number acquired company duties. With a view to the lessening of this drain to some ex tent, it is recommended that the law authoriz ing the detail of officers from active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities, be soameud cd as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the army. Attention is asked t3 the necessity of providing legisla tion for organizing, arming and disciplining die active militia of the country, and liberal appropriations are recommended in this be half. Report of the adjutant general of the army and chief of the ordinance touching this subject fully set forth in importance. The report of the officer in charge of education in the army shows that there are seventy-eight schools now in operation iu the army, with an aggregate attendanccof 2305 enlisted men and children. The secretary recommends the en listment of one hundred and fifty schoal mas ters, with the rank and pay of commissary ser geants. An appropriation U needed to supply judge advccntes of the army with suitable libraries and the setary recommends that a corps of judge advocates be placed upoi the same footing as to promotion with other staff corps of the anny. Under exclusive laws, the bureau of military justice consists of but one officer, the judge advocate general and a orps of judge advocates, of eight officers of coual rank (major),with the provision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four, when reduced bv casualty or re.-ignation to that number. The consideration of the bureau of military justice and corps of judge advocates upon the same basis with other staff corps of the army, would re remove an unjast discrim ination agaiust deserving officers, and sub serve the best interest of the ser.iee. THE ENGINEER CORPS. Especial attention is asked to the report of the chief of engineers, upon the conditi in of our nautical defences. From personal inspec tion of many of the fortificatious, the secre tary is able to emphasize the recommendations made, and to state their incomplete, and de fenceless conditions is discreditable to the country. While 'other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on warfare and attacking maritime cities, we have been dormant in preparation for defence; nothing of importance has been done toward strength ening and finishing, our casemated works since our late civil war, during which the great guns of modern warfare and heavy ar mor of modern forticatfons and ships came into use among nations, and our earthworks left, by the sudden failure of appropriations, some years since, in all stages of incompletion arc now being rapidly destroyed by the ele ments. THE MISSISSIPPI AND COLUMBIA RIVERS. The two great rivers of the North American continent, Mississippi and Columbia, have their navigable waters wholly within the lim its of the United State, and are of vast impor tance to our internal and foreign commerce. The permanency of the impo tant work, seems now to be assured. There has been no fixture whatever in the maintainance of the maxi mum channel during the six months ending August the 9th last. Tills experiment has opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, 'upon the permanent success of which, congr itulations may be ex changed among people abroad aud at home, and especially among the communities of the Mississippi valley, whose commercial exchanges float in the unobstructed chaunel safely to and from the sea. The comprehensive improve ment of the Mississippi river and its tributa rie i Is a matter of transcendent importance. These great water ways comprise a system of inland transportation spread like a net work over a large portion of tne United States, and is navigable to the extent of many thousands or miles. Producers aud consumers alike have common interest in such unequalled fa cilities for :heap transportations of the coun try. The channels of coaimunication and in terchange are the property of the nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters and the plainest principles of public interest require their intelligent and careful supervi sion, with a view to their protection, improve ment and enhancement of their usefulness. THE CHANNEL OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER for a distance of about a hundred miles from its mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion serious delays in naviga- onanda heavy expense for lighterage, and '.ounage depth of at least twei'ty feet at low ade 6hould be secured and miintained, to uieet the requirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean commerce !t sub serves. The most urgent need, however, for this great water way is the permanent im provement of the channel, at the mouth of the river, from Columbia river to San Francis co, a distance of over 600 miles. There is no harbor on the Pacific coast, which can be ap proached during stormy weather. An appro priation of 150,000 was made by the Forty fifth congress, for the commencement of a break-water and harbor refuge, to be located at some point between the straits of Fuca and San Francisco, at which the necessities of commerce, local and general, will be best ac commodated. Tlio amount appropriated Is thought to be Inadequate for the purpose In tended. The cost of the work, when finished, will be ven- great, owing to the want of natu ral advantages for a site at any point on the coast betweeii designated limits, and it has not been thought advisable to undertake the work without a larger appropriation. I com mend it to the favor of congress. THE NEW WAR OFFICE. The completion of the new building for the war department is urgently needed,and esti mates for continuing its construction are es pecially recommended, 'the collections of books, specimens, aud records constituting the army medical museum and library of na tional importance. The library now "contains about 51,500 volumes and 57,i0pain' llcts re lating to medicine, surgery and allied tonics. The contents of the army medical museum consist of 22,000 specimens, and are unique in completeness with which both military sur gery and disease of armies are illustrated, their destruction would be an irreparable Toss, not only to the United States, but to the world. "There are tiled in record and pension division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, together with a great quantity of pa pers embracing the original records of the hos pitals oi our armies dunng the civil war. Aside from their historical value, these records are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement of large numbers of the pen sions and other claims, for the protection of the government against attempted frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claimants. These valuable collections are now in the building which is peculiarly exposed to danger of destruction by lire. It is, therefore, earn estly recommended that appropriations be made for a new fire-proof building, adequate for the present needs and reasonable future expansion of these valuable collections. Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof. No expenditure for mere architectural display is required. It is belived that a suitable struc ture can be erected at a cost not to excee I two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I commend to the attention of congress the great services of the commander-in-chief of our armies during the war for the Union. whose wise, linn and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that moment of our conflict to a close. The legislation of the United States contains many precedents for recognition of distinguished'niilitary merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent . the appointment of a captain-general of the anny, with suitable provisions reiatiug to com pensation, retirement and other details, would, in my judgment bo altogether fitting pro ,er, and "would be warmly approved by the couutry. THE NAVY. The report of the secretary o' the navy ex hibits successful and satisfactory management of that department. During the past fiscal year the total expenditures for the year were "$12,916,639, leaving unexpended at the close ol the year, f'J,l41,(Si or the amount availa ble of the appropriations. Appropriations for the present fiscal year, ending June 30. 1SS1, are 15,095,061, and the total estimates for the fiscal vear ending June 30, 1SS0 are $15,953, 751. The amount drawn bv warrant from July 1, 1SS0, to November 1, lSiO, is $5,041,590. The recommendation of the secretary of the navy that provision le made for the establishment of some form of :ivil government for the p. o plc of Alaska is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property fn that territory, except such as is offered by officers of the United States ship Jamestown. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka because of fear that without the presence of national author ity there was impending danger of anarchy. The step taken to restore order has been ac cepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for this method of restraint does Hot, in my opinion, now ex ist If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving our people as at present without the ordinary judicial and administra tive authority or organized local government serious consequence's might ensue. Thelaw provides only for the collection of revenue, the protection of property, and the transmis sion of the mails. The problem is to lpply local rule to a population so scattered and so peculiar in its origin and condition. The na tives are reported to be teachable and self-sup porting, and if properly instructed doubtless would" advance rapidly" In civilization and a new factor of prosperity would be added to our national life. I therefore recommend req uisite legislation upon this subject Th sec retary of the navy has taken steps towards the establishment" 'f naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama to meet the require ments of our commercial relations with Cen tral and South America, which are respective ly growing in importance. Locations emi nently suitable, both as regards our naval pur poses and the uses of commerce, have been selected; one on the east side of the isthmus at Chriqui Logoon, in the Caribean sea, and the other on the Pacific coast, at the bay of Galfito. The only safe har'jors sufficiently commodious on the isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less than 100 miles. The report of the secretaryof the navy concludes with valuable suggestion? with respect to building up our merchant mar ine service service, and which deserves favora ble consideration from ccrgress. THE POSTOFF1CE DEPARTMENT. The report of the postmaster general ex hibits the continual growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal service. Operations of no department of the government, erhaps, represent with greater exactness, the Increase in the population and business of country. In I860 the postal receipts were $S,51S,067; in 1SS0 the receipts were $33,315,479. All inhabi- L tants of the country are having proper mail fa cilities, and naturally watcn tne postoince very closely. This careful oversight on the part of the people has proved a constant stim ulus to improvement During the past year there was an increase of 2,132 postoflices, and the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making an additional annual transportation of 1.0,301,191 miles. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing vear are estimated at $3S,S45,174 and the expenditures at $42,473,932 leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the treasury of $3,620,797. The universal pos tal union has received an aicesslon of almost . all the countries and colonies of the world maintaining organized postal services, and it is confidently expected that all other countries and colonies now outside the union will soon unite therewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the union of form ing, for the purposes of international mail communication, a single postal territory em bracing the world, with complete uniformly in postal charges and conditions of interna tional exchange, for all descriptions of corres pondence. To enable the United States to do its full share in this great work, additional legislation Is asked bv the postmaster general, to whose recommendation especial attention is called. The suggestion of the postmaster general that it would be wise to encourage, by appropriate legislation the establishment of American li jes of steamers by our own cit izen to carry mails between our own p rtsand those of Mexico, Central America, South America aud of trans-Pacific countries, is commended to the serious consideration of congress is also invited to suggestions of postmaster general in regard to postal sav ings. TOE 

FEDERAL COURTS. The necessity for additional provision, to aid in the transaciion of the business of the feder al courts becomes each year more apparent The dockets of the supreme court, and of the circuit court, ingreaternumberof circuits, are encumbered with the constant accession of cases. In the former court and In many in stances in circuit court, years Intervene be fore it Is practicable to bring a case to a hearing. The attorney general recommends the establishment of an intermediate court of errors and appeals. It is recommended that the number of judges of the circuit court In each circuit, with the exeption of the sec ond circuit, should be increased by the addi tion of another judge; In the second circuit that two should oe added and that anintenne diate appellate court should be formed iu each circuit, to consist of the circuit judge and cir cuit justice, and that in the event of the ab sence of either of these judges the place of the absent judge should be supplied by the judge of one of the district courts in the cir cuit. Such appellate cour coublbe safely In vested with large jurisdiction, and circuit de cisions would satisfy suitors, in many cases where appeals would still be allowed to the supreme court. The expense incurred for this intermediate court willbe very moderate. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The increase of the appropriations for the expenses of the department of justice. This rec mmendatlon Is commended to the care ful consideration of congress. It Is evident that the delay of justice, in many Instances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now nec essarily occurs in federal courts, which will in this way be remedied. The report of the secretary "of the interior presents an elab orate account of the operations of that de partment during'the past year. INDIAN AFFAIRS. It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in a more hopeful condition now than ever before. Indians have made gratifying progress in agriculture, herd ing and mechanical pursuits. Many who were a few years ago in hostile conflict with the government are quietlysettllngdown otifarms where they hope to make their permanent homes building houses, and engaging in occu pations of civilized life. The introduction of freighting business among them has been re markably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and remunerative employment and in stimulating thtir ambition to earn their own support Their honesty and efficiency as carriers is highly praised. The organization of a police force of Indians, has beeu equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservation, and in exer-ei-ing a wholesome moral influence among she Indians themselves. I believe with the tecretary of the interior in the recommenda tion that the pay of this force be Increased as an inducement to best class young men to en ter it. Much care and attention has been de voted to the enlargement of educational facil ities for the Indians. The means for this im portant object have beei verv inadequate. A few additional hoarding schools at Indian agencies have been established, and the erec tion of buildings has been begun for several more, but Increased appropriations for this in teresting undertaking are greatly needed to accommodate the large number of Indian children of school age. The number offered by their parents from all parts of the country" for educating in government schools is much larger than can be accomodated with means at present available for the purpose. The number of Indian pupils at the nonnal school at Hampton, Virginia, uider direction of Gen eral Annstrong, has been considerably in creased, and their progress highly encouraging. The Indian school established bv the interior department In 1S79, at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, uuder direction of Captain Pratt, has been equally successful. )t has now nearly two hundred pupils of both sexes, representing a great variety of the tribes east of the Rocky mountains. Pupils in both these institutions receive, not only an element lryEngl sh educa tion, but are also instructed in housework, ag riculture, and useful mechanical pursuits. A si nilar school was established this yearat For est Grove, Oiegon, for the education of Indian youth on the Pacific coast In addition to this, thirty-six Indian boys and girls were se lected from the eatem Cherokecs, and placed in bo rding schools In North Carolina, where thev are to receive anetementarvEmrlishedu- eation, and training in industrial pursuits. The Interest shown bv Indian parents, even among so-called wild tribes, iu educating their children is very cratisving, and gives promise that results accomplished by efforts now making will be of lasting benefit Ex penses for Indian education so far have been drawn from the permanent civilization fund at the disposal of the interior department; but the fund is so much reduced, continuance of this beneficial work will In the future depend on specific appropriations by congress for that purpose, anil I venture to express hope that r . .. . .. -.." . congress will not permit Institutions so fruit ful of good resu't6 to perish for want of means lor their support On the contrary, increase of the number of such schools appears to me highly advisable. The past year has beeu un usually free from disturbances among Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the Utes, by which they surrender their large reservation in Colora"do in consideration of an annuity to be paid them, and agree to settle In severality on certain lands designated for that purpose, as farmers, holding individual title to their land in fee simple, Inalienable for a cer tain period. In this way :ostly Indian wars have been avoided, which, atone time, seemed imminent, and, for the first timeiuthehistory of the country, an Indian nation has given up its tribal existence to settle in severalty and live as individuals under common protection of the laws of the country. THE CONDUCT OF THE INDIANS throughout the country during the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions, have been carried on for two yeare by Victoria and his baud of southern Apaches, has virtually come to an end oy the death of that chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil. The disturbances caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge in British dominion, are also likely to cease. A large majority of his followers nave surrendered to our military forces, and the remainder are apparently in progress of dis integration. I concur with the secretary of the interior In expressing earnest hope that congress will at this session, take favorable action on the bill providing for an allotment of lands ou different reservations In severalty to Indians, with patents confering fee simple title inalienable for a certain period, and eventual disposition of the residue of the re servations, for general settlement with con sent aud for the benefits of In bans, placing the latter under equal protection of the laws oi the country, this measure, together with vigorous prosecution of our educational e forts will work mos important and effective advance toward solution of the Indian problem in preparing for gradual merging our Indian people into the great bodv of American citi zenship. A large increase is reported in the disposal of PUBLIC LANDS FOR SETTLEMENT during the past year, which marks prosperous growth of our agricultural industry, and vig orous movement of the population towards our unoccupied lands. As this movement pro ceeds the codification of our land laws as well as proper legislation to regulate the dis position of public lands become of more press ing necessity, and I therefore invite the con sideration of congress to report the accompa ing draft of a bill, made by the public land commission, which was communicated bv me to congress at its last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desira ble. The attention of congress isagiin asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber lands and the rapid and in discriminate destruction of our forests. Ur gent necessity for legislation tothisend is now generally recognized in view of the lawless character of the depredations committed, and the disastrous consequences which will inev itably follow their continuance. Legslation has again and again been recommended to ar rest this evil and preserve for the people of our western sta'.es and territories the timber needed for domestic and other essential uses. The report of the director of geological sur veys is a document of unusual interest Con solidation of the various geological and geo graphical surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which has heretofore operated upou an independent plan without concert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to all those indus dostries of the country which depend upon the development of our mineral resources. The labors of the scientific men of recognized merit who composed the corps of the geologi cal survey during the first season of theirfleld operations and their inquiries, appear to have been very comprehensive and will soon be communicated t congress in a number of vol umes. The directorof the survey recommends that the investigations carried on by his bu reau, which so tar have been confined to so called public land, states and territories, be extended over the whole country, and that the necessary appropriation be made for this pur pose. This would be particularly beneficial to the Iron, coal aud other mininginterests of the Mississippi valley and of the eastern and southern states. The subject is commended to the careful consideration of congress. AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL. The commissioner of agriculture expresses confident belief that h-.s efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and tea have been encouragingly rewarded. The im portance of the results attained have attract ed marked attention at home, and have re ceived the special consideration of foreign nations. The successfn cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture of our own su gai, would make a difference of many mil lions o dollars annually in the wealth of the" nation. The commissioner asks attention particularly to tin coutinucd prevalence .of the infectious and contagious cattle disease, known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as a cattle-plague, or pleuro-pneumonla. A mild type of tins disease, in certain sections of our country, is the occasion of great loss to our farmers, and sarious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain. The value of meat cattle exported from the United States, for eight months, ended August 31,1SS0, was more than twelve million dollars, and nearly double the value for the same period in '79. Your early attention is solicited to this important mat ter. 

INDUSTRIAL TRAlNlNa Is attracting deserved attention, and colleges for instruction, theoretical and practical, In agriculture and mechanic arts, including the government schools recently established for instruction of the Indian department, are gaining steadily in public estimation. The commissioner asks special attention to depre dations committed on lands received for fu ture support of public instructions, and to the very great need of help from the nition for schools In territories and In southern states. Recommendation heretofore made. Is repeated and urged that an educational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sale of pub lic lands annually, the income of which and remainder of net annual proceeds to be dis tributed on some satisfactory plan to states and territories and the District of Columbl. The success of the public schools of the Dis trict of Columbia, and the progress made un der intelligent direction, board of education and superintendent, in supplying the . duca tional requirements of the district with thor oughly trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifyiug. Acts of congress from time to time, donating public lands to several states and territories in aid of educational interests have proved to be wise measures of public policy, resulting in great and lasting benefit It would seem to be a matter of simple wis dom which has been so fully vindicated by ex perience to the District of Columbia. I again commend the general Interests of the District of Columbia to the favorable consideration of congress. The affairs of the District, as 6hown by the report of the commissioners, are In very satisfactory coudition. 

INCIDENTAL MENTION. The secretary of the interior asks attention to the want of room in the public building of the capitol, now existing, and in progress of construction, for the accommodation of the clerical force employed, and of public records. Necessity has compelled renting private build ings In different parts of the city for the lo cation of public offices, for which a large amount of rent is annually paid, while the separation of offices belonging to the same department, impedes the transaction of cur rent business. The secretary suggests that blocks surrounding Lafayette square on the east, north and west, be purchased as sites for new edifices fo- the accommodation of gov ernment offices, leaving the square Itself In tact; and that, If sucti bulld'ngs were con structed on a harmonious plan of architec ture, they would add much beauty to the na tional capitol, and would, together with the treasun and new state, navy and war depart ment building, form one of the most Impos ing groups of public edifices In the world. 

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. In my annual messages heretofore, and In my special message of December 19th, 1S73, 1 have urged upon the attention of congress the necessity of reclaiming the marshes of the Potomac, adjacent to the capital, and I am constrained by its Importance to advert again to the subject These flats embrace an area of several hundred miles. They are an impedi ment to the drainage of th city anil seriously impair iti health. It is believed, with this substantial improvement of Its river-front, the capital would be, in all respects, one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its pennanent population this city Is necessarily the place of residence of persons from even" section of the country en gaged In . public senice. Many others reside here temporarily, for the transaction of business with the government It should mt be forgotten that the land ac quired will prfibablybe worth thecost of re claiming it, and navigation of the river be greatly improved. I therefore ag.iin invite the attention of congress to the Importance of prompt provision for this much neede I and too long delayed improvement. The water supply to the city is inadequate. In addition to the ordinary use throughout the citvVto the consumption by the government and "is twss sarily vcrygreat In the navy yard, arsenal and" various deportments, and the large quantity that is required for the proper preser vation of the numerous parks and cleansing of sewers. I recommend tide subject receive the early attention of congress and that in making provision for increased supply, such Ticans be adopted as will have m view 'he luture growth or the city. Temjxiray expedients for such purpose cannot but be wasteful of money, and there fore unwise. A more ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my judgement be constructed. I commend again to the attention of congress the subject of remoial fiom their prcsentToca tion of the depots of several railroads entering the city, and I renew the recommendations of my former messages in behalf of the erection of a building for a congressional library; com pletion of the Washington monument, and of liberal appropriations in support of the be nevolent reformatory, and penal institutions of the District.

Setemup's Mistake. BnrllrKton Hawlceye. Mr. Setemup came down stairs to a 10 o clock breakfast with a vacant coun tenance and a backward tendency in his hair that made his two eyes ache. He sat down at the table and picking up his knife and fork, glared in an uneasy wonder at something in the platter be fore him. It had evidently been fried in butter and was intended for food. Mr. Setemup harpooned it with his fork and lifted it up bodily, gazing at it with ever increasing wonder. "What under the sun," he exclaimed at last, "is this thing?" "Well," replied his patient wife with just the shallow of a sigh, "it looks like your new soft felt hat, and that is what I thought it was. but vou pulled it out of 3'our pocket when you came home this morning and said it was a nice porter house steak, and you wanted it broiled for breakfast. Yon needn't give me any ol it; I'm not hun gry." And Mr- Setemup, who was just wild to know what else he said when he came home, and what time it was, for the life of him didn't dare ask.
