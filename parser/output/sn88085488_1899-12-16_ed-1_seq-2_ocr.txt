ifM PRISONER'S HIE THEY ARE HELD AS HOSTAGES >one lime Hern Allowed to ■■•■»*- Otls RSI Sent A«winaldo WSTSISI —He Will He Held Personally He ■nonalble. New York, Dec. 12.—A ipedal from Washington says: Considerable concern has been felt in -I- •ficial circles for some time respecting the fate of the American prisoners still held by the Filipino Insurgents, This is due to an Intimation made by Aguinaldo in a note to General Otis, delivered a month ago. that grave injury might befall the prisoners if recognition of the so-called Filipino republic by the United States were longer delayed. It was in answer to this threat that the president sent a message to General Otis for transmission to Aguinaldo announcing that if the prisoners were maltreated in any manner he and his subordinates j would be held personally responsible. At that time Aguinaldo was believed to be; within the cordon established by the. American troops reaching from San Fabian to Isidro. Considerable concern has been caused by the fact that although a great many Spanish prisoners have been allowed to escape, not a single American has come through the lines. Miller and Waller Won.

ISAMPSON-SCHLEY QUESTION Controversy M to Which Won Sun tiiiKO Victory SIIII Unnettied. New York, Doc. 12.—A special fror Washington says: It is said that the president will soo: send to congress a special message regard ing rewards for officers and men from th Atlantic fleet who distinguished them selves during the war with Spain a"' whose gallantry lias not yet been recog nized. President McKinley has the same Samp son-Bchley matter under serious consider ation. Be is understood to be willing tha a bill should be passed authorizing the ro I vjval of the grade of vice admiral for tin benefit of Rear Admirals Sampson am Schley, tne former to be given seniority of tiie other. It is believed Secretary Long will join in indorsing this solutioi of the controversy. What will probably cause considerabl* criticism among Hear Admiral Schley'i friends is the determination of Secretarj Long to name Admiral Sampson in tin measure he IS preparing, giving th( thanks of congress to the commander-in chief of the north Atlantic squadron ant the officers and men under his command It is not believed, however, that th< president will transmit such a resolution to congress, knowing what determined op position it will meet and the probability that friends of Schley would have his name substituted for that of Sampson and pass the resolution in that form. 

BOERS ON MODDER RIVER. ilctlnicii linn Driven Them From En trenched I'oNition on mil*. Modder River, Dec. —The naval four seven-inch battery again took up a posi tion north of the camp, while the How itzer battery was posted to the southeast on the left of the Boers. Both opened a hot lire with Lyddite shells and shrapnel, to which the Boers sharply responded wjth i dozen guns, thus unmasking their posi tion, which was the object of the British maneuver. After an hour's fighting the Boer guns were silenced. The howitzers learched the trenches and then threw t&ell ifter shell upon the hills, the explosion of the Lyddites causing the whole ground hit an extensive area to rise in the air in lense brown clouds. A Boer long gun ,vas dismantled. It now appears that the Boers intend that the next tight is to take •lace at Magorsfontein. Apparently Spy fontein is not defended or the Boers are .mwilling to unmask their position there. ChlutlßO "Won. Madison, Wis., Dec. —The western football championship goes to Chicago, Before at least 12,000 people the eleven of the University of Chicago defeated the University of Wisconsin by a score of 17 to 0 in a game that for desperate play ng ami clean, scientific football, has prob ably never been equalled on a western jridTron. It was a game between a team which in offensive playing was perfect, with weath er and wind in its favor, and an eleven whose dense play up to today had been compact enough to protect the goal line from all opposing elevens except Yale. But Chicago's mass plays were insisti ble, and though the Badgers fought until they could fight no more through the first half and again in the second half, the Maroon backs plunged through Wiscon sin's line until the ball was carried ovcj the goal line. Only once did Wisconsii have a chance to score, and that oik chance they were unable to avail them -elves of, as with the ball on their owi 15-yard line, the Chicago forwards braee< -.) effectively that on four downs the bal was only shoved forward throe yards, li this respect the Chicago players surprise! their supporters. The defensive play wa far stronger than expected, and eve! when Wisconsin had the ball, which wa seldom, ODea was compelled to kick ii most instances.

LABOR miii;>. Secretary Puttee, of Winnipeg Typo graphical Union, is a candidate for fed eral parliamentary honor. About 150 New York photo-engravers employed in the commercial houses are striking for an increase. The report of the Austrian Typo graphical Federation for 1898 shows a membership of 8,153, distributed among fifteen subordinate bodies. The professors and students of po litical economy in a number of the lead ing universities have taken up the sub ject of union labels and their influence on wages. The Seattle Building Laborers' Union has adopted a new scale of wages, as follows: Plasterers' tenders, $3.50 per day; mortar men, for brick work, $3.00 per day; wheelers and other laborers, $2.50 per day. This scale takes effect January 1, 1900. The American Federation of Labor will meet in annual convention at De troit, Mich., December 11, and it is an ticipated the attendance will be the largest in the history of that organiza tion. Southern unions of all crafts are go ing forward by leaps and bounds, and right in the van may be found Atlanta Typographical Union. Not only has it increased in membership and power, but it has organized a ladies' auxiliary. Even the pick and shovel man is to be "machined" out of his job, as a Chi cagoan has invented a contrivance which will dig a ditch three feet wide and six feet deep, dumping the dirt on either side, at the rate of a loot per minute. The cooks and waiters of Cripple Creek made a demand Monday for an increase in wages in first class restau rants to $25 per week for the former and $17.50 for the waiters, from $21 and $15 per week. A proportionate raise is asked also in second-class estab lishments. Tho second-class restau rants granted the scale at once, but the high class restaurants refused and closed up. We look for complete suc cess on the part of the cooks and wait ers, for they have the support of unit ed labor in their demands. In England, Tom Cronin, general sec retary of the iron and steel workers, defeated a milionaire opponent for city council in Hutcheson. The latter was supported by the two old parties, while Cronin was the nominee of the allied Socialist parties and trade unions. Proceeds from a street fair given by the unions of Syracuse, N. V., will go toward building a temple of labor there. Deposits Falling mi. New York, Dec. 11. —The Financier says: The statement of the Now York Asso ciated Banks ending December 9, proved a surprise in the moderate amount <>i cash losses for the week. It had been fig ured that as a result of the operati >ns with the sub-treasury and the interior at least .«1>,000,000 had been taken from the reserve, and that surplus holdings would show a heavy decline. Yet the total de crease in excess reserve, as revealed by the figures, was only $1,677,175. The act ual loss in cash holdings was $2,675,300, which is to be traced for the most part to one institution. I»ans fell off $695,000, and deposits nearly $4,000,000 the decrease in the lat ter bringing the reserve requirements down about $1,000,000. The British 1..1NN. Pretoria, Dec. 13. —President Steyn, of the Free State, has sent the following de tails of the fight at Stoimbrrg Junction: "The British, with six cannon, attacked the Boers under Swanepool and Oliver and stormed the Boers' intrenched positions on the kopjes. After a severe fight the Brit ish were compelled to surrender. The prisoners are Major Sturges, six officer*, ii".() non-conunissioned officers and men of the Northumbeilands and two ofhYers and about 200 non-commissioned officers and men of the Irish Fusileers. It is impos sible to state the number of dead am wounded British. The lkx-i^ captorec three cannon and two ammunition wig ons.
