The Senate Chamber a Bed of Roses, and its Republican Occupants Conclude to Let Turpie Share it. WA5snmoTON, December 6.-Long be fore noon yesterday, the gallery of the house was crowded to the utmost capacity with spectators drawn together to witness the opening scene of congress. The ladies were in the majority, and their costumes lent an - air f picturesqueness to the chamber. On the floor members congre gatsed and exchanged greetings and con gratulations. There were very few floral dec;irations on the desks of members. The clerk proceeded with the roll call. The house having elected Mr. Carlisle speaker, that gentleman made a speech of thanks for the honor conferred upon him, in which he directed attention to the im portant labors which would devolve upon the present congress, and dwelt with much stress on the imperative necessity of such a moderate and reasonable reduction of the tariff as would guarantee laboring people against the effects of a financial depression, and id the meantime not de prive them of any part of the just rewards of toil. The work of organizing the house then proceeded. 

ANIMATED SCENE IN TIHE SENATE. The senate chamber wore a fresh and tasteful appearance yesterday morning. The floors and galleries were newly car peted, and the desks glistened in coats of new varnish, the odor of which mingled faintly with that of the boquets and gor geous floral devices which enlivened the picture. The senators began to arrive and take their places before 11 o'clock. Sen ators Stewart and Hiscock being the first comers. For an hour before noon the floor was a busy scene. 31embers of both par ties, their friends and the officers of the senate taking this occasion to exchange greetings and compare notes. The chief topic of conversation in the majority was the prospects of a conflict over the admis sion of certain democratic senators elect, and it early became known that the re publicans, in default of any caucus plan of action, had concluded to follow the le:ld of their members of the committee of privileges and elections. There had been formal consultations it was under stood, and they had reached the conclu sion to make no opposition to the admis sion of Turpie of Indiana, but to object to admission of Faulkner of West Virginia, on the ground that there was conflicting credentials from that state. The general opinion was that there would be no dead lock, anl the usuai course of opening pro ceedings would not be broken. DRAWING A LARGE HOUSE. The galleries were early crowded to overflowing. Mrs. Cleveland clad in a costume of dark green, accompanied by Mrs. Gilde and Mrs. Kingsford and sev eral ladies, occupied seats reserved for the family of the president in one of the pri vate galleries. The diplomatic gallery was filled by members of the various leg etations. The front seat was occupied by the Chinese minister, his secretary and his associates. He wore a magnificent robe of light blue satin, and his compan ions were clad as richly, though in more subduea colors. The proceedings of the day were open ed with a prayer by the chaplain, Rev. J. G. Butler. The president of the senate, Mr. Ingalls, then took the chair and call ed the senate to order. He said he would place before the senate certificates of elec tion, certificates of appointments and other important papers received since ad journment. MR. 

HOAR OBJECTS. In swearing the senators elect, senator Hoar made objection to the administration of the oath to Faulkner of West Virginia, until certain questions to which his cre dentials gave rise, could be passed upon by the committee of privileges and elec tions. As a member A that committee he assured the senate that the matter would receive immediate attention from the committee and that if the gentleman were found to have been entitled to his seat, he could enter upon his duties with out unnecessary delay. Senator Kenna said that the course proposed by senator Hoar seemed appro priate, and he trusted would be followed without the formality of a vote. This course was adopted and the call of sena tors elect proceeded. The oath was ad ministered to Mr. Turpie of Indiana, and he was admitted to his seat. All the pa pers in the case were referred to the com mittee on privileges and elections. Glittering Gold. There was a sight in Buckskin gulch yesterday that would have made the old pet p)acer miner's heart leap with joy, The surface had been washed off, and the large cut in the jagged bedrock for over 100 feet was a mass of glittering gold. In places where it had lodged in the crevices it could be picked up by the spoonful. About a pint of nuggets from $20 to $50 in weight were picked up in the forenoon by Charles Dudley, and about 20 pounds of gold had already been taken to the bank which had been scooped out of the potholes. No very large pieces had been found; the largest would probably not go over three ounces. The clean up, which will probably take two or three days yet to make complete, will be by far the larg est ever made in the camp. It is esti mated to reach fifty pounds, or in the neighborhood of $9,000.-U-,nwr de Alene SPIRITED RIVALRY. The Plucky Montana Central Estab lishes Communication with Marysville.

WASHINGTON, December 6.-The World's Washington correspondent says: "The president's message to congress, for the first tima in our history, will discuss but one question.

The Wealthiest Woman in Brainerd Marries a Tramp-Her First Husband Finds Anoth er Wife. BItAINEUD, December 1.-A quiet mar riage of Mrs. Magdalena Schwartz to An drew Robinson, a young man, is the sequel to one of the most romantic experiences of local knowledge. When Brainerd bid fair in the early days to sometime be a town, a thrifty German named William Schwartz arrived direct from the old country and, after prospecting a little, made'a rich discovery of fine clay for brick, just above the city in the river bank. He secured a large tract of land, several hundred acres, which adjoined the orig inal townsite, and also the town plat about the Northern Pacific shops, East Brainerd. He built fine buildings and opened large brick works, with a steam plant, and got rich in short order. But his domestic matters were in a serious shape.- His wife was childless and, whether justly or not, Schwartz became exceedingl3 jealous of his buxom wife and the common hands about the works. and finally after a period of friction which made their quarrel no torious, Schwartz and she agreed to sepa rate. Hie generously gave to her all the property, then worth a handsome sum, and he pulled out to Germany and mar ried a young girl there and brought her at once to this country. lie did not stop here, but went out to Oregon, to build a new home, settling at Corvallis, whence in a year lie wrote that "he was getting on first rate. IIaff got a bouncing baby." Meanwhile Mrs. Schwartz, the first, conducted the old business here, making 1,000,000 brick every year. Schlwartz had laid out a large addition in lots, which were sold off, and the dam of the Mississ ippi Water Power & Boom Company hav ing been located on her property, largely increased it in value, until $100,000 wouldn't buy all her interests here. Last winter among impecunious arrivals from Dakota was Andrew Robinson, a young man about twenty-five years old. He was illy-clothed, without shoes;,his feet wrap. ped in gunny sacks, but borrowing an ax, he walked eight miles through the deep snow to a job cutting cordwood he had se cured. He so spent the winter, and not being a "pusher," when spring came he had netted for the winter's work, besides some better clothes, less than $20. He worked awhile in the spring in a board ing camp at the dam for a little more than his board until Mrs. Schwartz, the owner of the hundred thousand, hired him to chore about the place, Not to probe the processes of cupid-there have been signs that young RIlobison was prospering. He dressed up, grew a full beard, and drove his empicyer daily into town in the fam ily buggy. Two weeks ago she made a trip to Oregon, now supposed to have been to make sure that she was free to wed, and returning she permitted herself to become Mrs. Andrew Robinson. Thus she, at about fifty years of age, secures a husband of about half the age, while he from so distressed a situation as to this world's goods becomes by all odds the richest man, in clean-up money, in Brai nerd. Re'ported Fenian Plots. LONDON, December 5. - The Morning Post declares that certain Parnellites re cently urged the Fenians to murder lord Hartingtou, which they refused to do. The American Fenians then undertook the task, arriving on the continent a month ago for that purpose. These, in concert with a few Irish Fenians, made arrange ments by which the rails on the road be tween Kingston and Dublin were to be re moved in order to wreck the train carry ing lord Hartington and 3Mr. Goschen last week, and in the excitement shots were to be fired into the carriage occu biedbythe English visitors. The scheme was abandoned when it was known that lord Hartington and Mr. Goachen travel ed by different trains. It was next ar ranged to attack Mr. Power's carriage in a lonely lane and murder lord Harting ton, or to carry him into the Wicklow mountains, where he was to be held as a hostage for the release of O'Brien and other political prisoners. The plot mis carried owing to the watchfulness of the police. Extensive Bank -Frauds. CINCIxATr, December 3.-At the open ing of the HIarper trial Mr. Schofleld of the First National Bank of New York ex plained the account of his bank with the Fidelity, stating that the Fidelity's general account showed a credit of $500,000 while their special account showed a deficit of $500,000. He said that it was an agree ment that the special account was not to be drawn upon. Bank examiner Powell, who was the government agent in closing the doors of the Fidelity last June, told his story how he was begged by Harper to pass the examination and was then asked to telegraph the comtroller of the curren cy for authority not to mke an examina tion. He then found the tell tale mema randum cheeks as ccash representing $600,000. Briggs Swift, the president, arid he :never. knew of thesm till then. Harer, when asked for an expahi tioo, *nl e4Rway ln oa 1e , . r; wI~,l54 count clerk, showed that discounts to the amount of $14,208 were made. between January and June, but most of them re mained uncollected. The defense then *rew from the witnesses the statement that W. H. Chatfield, one of the directors of the bank, was the one in whose name their discounts appeared as late as June, 13. W. A. Lewis, general bookkeeper, testified to a letter of advice from a party who had no funds in the bank. Harper took that letter and draft and it appeared in Harper's account with his endorse ment. 

CATTLE AND HORSES. I George Barron Gives Some Sound Opinions Thereon-This is Not a Good Time to Sell-Some Practical Points. George Barron, manager of the Mon tana Cattle Company, gives the Tribune some practical points on cattle and horse interests. "Range prices," he says, "are stronger. Several bunches that could be bought some time ago now can't be bought at all, which indicates that prices will be higher in the spring. People that hold cattle for the next two or three years are very likely to make money by so doing. SMy advice to cattle men would be to hold beef over next year; to sell nothing. The Chicago market is still overstocked and prices are low. There are too many peo ple unloading." RIegardiag winter shelter, Mr. Barron says: "Mr. Floweree is preparing to feed on Dupuyer creek some cattle that he brought from the Yellowstone. In general, peo ple look for a good winter and have not taken any steps to feed their cattle. Very few cattle were brought into the country this fall, but next year the drives and ship I ments may be the heaviest ever known. This is owing to the low price of cattle in general, but the good grass and fat beef of this season will encourage moneyed men to invest in cattle and make large shipments here next year." Referring to bull feeding, he observed: "As regards bull feeding, which now oc cupies attention, it must be said that it would be hard for the owners of large ranges to collect their bulls and feed them for the winter. The cost would be so great that there would not be gain enough in calves to meet the expense. I do not think that there is the'heavy loss of cows i and calves in the winter which some per sons assert. Feeding would not add to the branding." In relation to horses, Mr. Barron says: "The horse market is becoming stronger. I never knew a better time for investing in horses than atpresent, as on the range fresh horses are doing well. The man who raises 1,200 to 1,400-pound geldings within the next few years is the one who + will make money, as he will get as much for one gelding as for three or four steers. Moreover, as horses are hardier than cat- 4 tle, the investment is more secure. As 1 the ranges become overstocked, the cattle I losses will naturally be heavier while losses among horses will be merely nominal." More Clerks Needed. HEoLENA, December 5.-The following telegram has been forwarded to delegate Toole: " The Helena postoffice is closed nearly three hours in the forenoon to al low the separation and distribution of mails; the money order, register and gen eral delivery offices being closed. This entails serious inconvenience and pecu niary loss to the entire business commun ity. It is a public necessity that addition al clerical help be allowed the Helena postoffice." The telegram was signed by many leading publishers, bankers and merchants. Getting to be a "Tough" Town. HELENA, December 3.-S. L. Snyder, a railroad laborer, yesterday made a gun play at Jack Nolan, a gambler, in an up town barber shop. lie was overpowered while about to fire, and instead received a severe blow on the head with a poker in the hands of Nolan. The melee was soon ended by the interference of officers who took the combattants into custody. In the afternoon they were examined by magistrate English, who discharged No lan and give Snyder 30 days in jail for his unbecoming behavior. The Canadian Pacifie. nTchAGo, December 3.-The differen tial allowed by the American transcoenti nental lines to the Canadian Pacific is 30 cents on first class freight from New York, and 25 cents from Chicago to San Francisco.

Sadi Carnot the Successful Candidate, and the Selection Satisfactory to France and Europe. CHICAGO, December 3.-A News special telegram from Paris claims that Ferry is the Panama canal candidate for the presi dency. Ferry, it says, has promised the great financier DeLesseps that if elected he will endeavor to help the Panama Ca nal Company out of its present financial difficulties by getting France either to guarantee a loan to the Panama canal or float a grand lottery. Vast sums of money are said to have been spent in securing votes for him, with a view to future pat ronage. 

TIHE NEW ADMINISTRATION. PARIS, December 5.-President Sadi Carnet was formally installed in the Elysee palace Saturday afternoon and later on received visits from ex president Grevy, M. Rouvier, Peytrol of the budget committee, and other leading politicians.

In Rome, the news papers congratulate the French people upon the the election of president Sadi Carnot. President Carnot has requested the ministry to remain in office for the Tres ent, for the dispatch of public business. 

GERMANY WELL PILEASED. BERLIN, December 5.-Official and di plomatic circles in Berlin were absorbed in today's developments in Paris, but pub lic interest was not at all strained. An unceasing stream of telegrams poured into the foreign office and details of the voting at Versailles were sent without de lay. The election of Sadi Carnot is better received in official circles than would that of de Freycinet or Ferry. The new pres ident is said to be a feeble man and one who would be unwilling to consert to complications which might bring about an European war. It is also believed he will be unable to make an alliance against Germany. His personal preferences are for a neutral, pacific policy, and he will try to govern through a ministry of the same tendencies. A Lord Mayor Sentenced.

The soci ety has only been in eiistence five weeks, and yet has a membership of 10,000. The organizers so far have confined their at tention to business men, but it is thought the laboring men will be eager to ask for application as soon as they become cogni zant of the purposes of the order. Inci dentally, the order aims to secure an ex tension of the school system. San Francisco Makes a Bid.

MI anager Shelby's Report. HELENA, December 2.-General manan ger P. P. Shelby of the Montana Centrals returned Tuesday evening from a trip t9 Great Falls. He says that the bridge over the Missouri and the railroad to Sand Cou lee will be completed in thirty or forty days, when the fuel problem for Helena will be solved. The company there has coal as good for domestic purposes, for steam engines, for smelting as can be had in the western country, not excepting the Rock creek coal in Wyoming. A 200-foot tunnel has been run in the vein on a level, so that there wilLbe no expense for hoist ing or drainage. wlhe vein is 10 feet thick where the men are now working, and is 16 feet in thickness wihere the taking out of coal will begin. Mr. Shelby says a large number of men are at work ballasting and surfacing the Montana Central track and they will be kept at work during the winter so that 1 by early spring the company will have a line upon wh:ch a first-class passenger train can be placed with perfectsafety and with assurance that its schedule time will be run without delay. The Montana Central began yesterday to carry the mails to Rock creek, half way between Helena and Great Falls, and in a few days probably will carry the mail to Great Falls, Fort Benton and all northern Montana. This will be done by an ar i rangement with the present contractor, and the mail will, probably, be carried in closed pouches, the company not desiring to put on any mail cars until the fast pas senger train service is established. Butte's Water Supply. 

BU~TE, December 3.-The committee appointed some weeks ago to investigate the new water supply of the Silver Bow Water c.ompany, as to whether or not it was contamuninated by seepage from the graveyard, made their report last night to the city council. The committee consist ed of mayor Kenyon, Dr. Hough and al dermen Bateman and Owsley, and were assisted in their investigation by lead ing mining men. They sank wells and in other ways determined to their satisfac tion that the water underlying the whole section communicates, and that there is the best reason to suspect that the grave yard contaminates the water. A slaughter house and the smelters in the vicinity also serve to render tbe water unwhole some. The water in the well near the slaughter house and smelter is entirely unfit for use. The committee unhesitat. ingly condemn the new supply. Murderously Inclined.
