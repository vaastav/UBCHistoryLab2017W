ROYALTY'S "DIETS." foreign Rulers' Forcers of Dismissal of Officers. Km word in th English language appeals more rKmerfully to »• Anointed of the Lord than "diet.- , It stand- for those parliamentary Institutions which i>t : esch successive generation are increasing the legislative restrictions upon the authority and th« time honored Prerogatives of the monarch*. The word also constitutes to them an unpleasant re minder that th-y are compelled to humor, not only tne will of their people, but also the caprices of their own royal digestions. Th*se nro for the most part badly damaged. They are likely to be delicate by Inheritance, ana Impaired by the lack of sim plicity in the food and the compulsion to depend upon highly seasoned dishes and gastronomieal masterpieces of culinary artists of Gallic origin, Instead of upon the plain fare with which people occupying _le«s exalted sphere* In life are obliged to be content King Charles of Rumania, whose health Is In an extremely critical condition, has been restricted lor many months past to a diet of milk and crack ers. Emperor Francis Joseph, now In the neigh borhood of eighty year* of age. ascribes the reten tion of his amazing physical and mental vigor to the fact that lie has always been extremely care ful about his diet, and Is now more strict about It than ever. Ha seldom touches anything at the banquets which he gives, rating alone before or afterward, dishes of the simplest description spe cially prepared for him. King Edward. In spite of his reputation as a gourmet, has for the last ten years observed the utmost caution with regard to his diet, to the tyranny of which he renders the mo« complete subjection. Emperor Nicholas and The Sultan of Turkey are obliged to be still more careful about their diet— less, however, by reason of delicacy of digestion than on account of the serious danger of poison. In fact, the Padishah never touches a single dish or bottle of water that does not reach his table sealed, after having been previously tusied by one of the highest and most trusted dignitaries of the realm, this office having been long filled by the gallant old field marshal Furnamed "The Victorious," who was the hero of the siege of Plevna In the last Turkish war with Russia. Another monarch, who Is a slave to diet Is Leo pold of Belgium, who restricts himself to the plain est fare. The two heaviest eaters of the now living crowned heads of Eurore are undoubtedly King Charles of Portugal, who ha* Inherited his voracious appetite from hi* grandfather, the late King Victor Em manuel of Ituly. and Klnp Alfonso of Spain, whose prowess Tvlth the fork i* duo to the fact that he is a Bourbon. The Bourbons have for hundreds of years been renowned for their extraordinary ca pacities in the matter of consumption of food, and It is not altogether surprising under the circum stances that most of the Bourbon kings of France, and many of those of Spain, and of the two Sicilies, have succumbed to stomach troubles. It Is prob ably owing to the youth of Don Alfonso that he re mains for the present so thin, and conveys bo little, notion by his appearance of the power of his ap petltlte for food— but not for drink, as h« is a tee totaller. But the Bulk of King Charles of Portugal is colossal, and almost as large as that of the late King of Wurtembcrg. renowned for his gluttony, and of the Maharajah of Travancor*. The latter undergoes each year a rather peculiar ceremony In connection with his avoirdupois. It ie known as the ceremony of Talanaram. and consists In weigh ing him against an equivalent weight In gold. The latter Is thereupon distributed among the poor, who assemble around the palace gates for the purpose. It stands to reason, therefore, that the loyal sub jects of this Indian potentate are extremely Inter ested in fattening him, with a view to the Increase of his weight. The most famous royal glutton on record Is. however. Louis XVI, of France, who lost his life, and that of his consort. Queen Marie Antoinette-, because of h!s slavery to his appetite. For they would have escaped at the time of their flight to Varenn-s had not the King Insisted m stopping at an Inn In order to devour a roast turkey, for which his stomach experienced an Insatiable craving. Just as he was finishing his meal his pursuers caught up with him and placed him. together with the Queen and the Dauphin, under arrest. They were taken back to Paris, where the boy died in th« prt«on Into which they had been thrown, and from which the King and Queen emerged only to go to the scaffold. HOW 

KING EDWARD -BREAKS" OFFICERS. President Roosevelt* request for legislation em powering the Chief Magistrate to dismiss from the navy, and presumably also from the army, offi cers without the action of a court martial Bt'ves to call attention to the fact that this 1b a prerogative enjoyed by some European rulers and denied to others. Thus It Is claimed and exercised by King Edward, whose government may be de scribed as the most democratic monarchy In ex istence. He is. by virtue of the terms of the con stitution, at liberty to dispense with the services of an. officer or man whom he sees fit to dismiss from the finny or from the navy. Officers. In particular, are 1 recently removed from the army without any court martial or Judicial trial of their com. A mere notice In "The Ga«tte" to the effect that "his majesty ha* no further use for the eervlcee of Captain This or Major That U all that Is neces sary to "break" an officer and to restore him to private life with the brand of what i 8i 8 equivalent to dishonorable discharge in this country. He has absolutely no redress in law. and. while he may demand a court martial, the sovereign, in his ca pacity as commander In chief, is at perfect freedom to torn a deaf ear to the. application. This fart was brougit to light at the time of th. Boer war. when a number of offlcerß were dis missal, cither for hopeless Incompetence or else for disobedience. Borne of them conceived that thoy had been badly used, and were convinced that D y reason of their having given the greater part of their life to the service of their country in th«» a-mv they had a right, at any rate, to a judicial • artne in the form of a court martial or of a court of inquiry, before betas dlemlMed. But they Sly found out their mistake, and that the tenure of their commission was entirely dependent upon the pleasure of the sovereign. The Crown Is absolutely supreme In command of the army and navy. and has th, *ple and exclusive power of raising and regulating armies and fleet.. Thi prerogative was disputed and claimed by the «o cJwl "Urn* Parliament" of Charles I. But ""on tl c Restoration it was solemnly declared by SS, Crown and -»_«.»< to be vested In the =h,^^r^^^ 9 -n,r l^u^^n^^wer of dlsmlssa! of Bfls .,., rertrlctsd form by the continental rS£ save in Russia, where the Czar"* authority in this particular is quite as large *« that of hi. vncle Edward VII. in Great Britain.

In the very brigades and divisions which they may have previously commanded. In fact, he lnf.lcted this penalty two or three years before the war with Japan upon a couple of generals who. rather the worse for drink, had disgraced themselves by a fistic encounter in the prsstnes of their troop*. 

REDRESS IN REACH OF FRENCH OFFICERS. li Franca t-- President of lbs Republic may. by means of a •scree countersigned by the Minister of War or of Marine, dismiss any officer or man CrSBB either of the sister services without any judicial hearing, but the object* or this SSVSlity liav* a means of r«-drt-«» at their dleposa] by an appeal to the Council of Ktaie, which may exact thojr restoration to the service.

MONDAY. DECE^rBER 17, 1906. Intolerable, but, although he Is at the head of what la generally admitted to be the moat perfect and up-to-date military system In the world, ha cannot divest an officer of his commission In the army without a Judicial hearing. In fact, nowhere do the officers of the army possess so much inde pendence aa in Germany, where the constitution and the law of the land stato that officers and men In the army may b» punished only In accord ance with the law and as the result of a sentence recognized by law as Judicial. This condition of affairs dates back to 1808. Up to that time the King of Prussia was perfectly free to dismiss whomsoever he saw fit, either with or with out the co-operation of a court martial. But after the crushing defeats by the French, the Prussian officers came to the conclusion that there was something wrong In the system, and, accordingly, with th» sanction of the King and of the legislat ure, formed themselves into a species of common wealth, the members of which were governed by Courts of Honor, then Instituted for the first time by law. This law of 1805. withdrawing the power of dismissal, and of other forms of punishment, from the Crown and vesting it in Courts of Honor composed of officers, was confirmed and amended in 1844, and on the constitution of the German Em pire was extended by Article 61 to the entire Ger man army, excepting, I believe, the troops of Ba varia. GERMAN COURTS OF HONOR. In fact, the sovereign is rendered by these laws the mere executor of the decrees of the courts of honor. To these every officer has a right to appeal for Justice. And so great is their power that .not only can no serious punishment, such as dismissal, be Inflicted without the sanction or by the decree of these courts of honor, but they even control the appointment of regimental officers to various corps. Thus, the Emperor, although ho can grant a com mission to an officer, cannot appoint him to a regi ment without the consent of the officers of that regiment, or against their wishes, as expressed by the officers assembled in a court of honor. That Is the reason why the German army, almost alone among the armies of the civilized world. Is without any Jewish regimental officers. The Kal eer Is willing enough to. grant them commissions; has, Indeed, conferred epaulettes upon them, but has never yet succeeded in getting any of them admitted to any regiment, the officers of which, possessing the same prerogatives as the members of a club In the selection cf their comrades, in variably blackballing Hebrew candidates. How Jealous are the German, and especially the Prussian, officers of their constitutional rights In connection with these courts of honor may be gathered from the fact that some ten years ago Prince Frederick of Hohenzollern resigned the command of, the Division of the Guards of the Prussian army because the Emperor declined to accept or to act upon the decision of a court of honor, declaring It to be unjust, and demanding a reconsideration of the matter by another court of honor. It is only fair to add that In this, as In many other matters of the same kind, the Emperor was championing the cause of liberalism against the prejudices of military caste. MUCH THE SAME IN OTHER ARMIES. In a modified form the earn*, condition of affairs prevails in the armies of Bavaria and Austria — that Is to say, the power of punishment and of the maintenance not merely of discipline but of the honor among the officers Is vested In the hands of the officers themselves. While in one way this 13 of advantage, since It safeguards the Interests of the officers both Individually and as a whole. it has Its drawbacks, lor It serves to maintain a military caste possessed of ethics which In many respects are narrow minded, antiquated and at variance with the laws of tho lane., and which the sovereign is powerless to override. From the above It will be seen that Emperor William has been handicapped in some of his most liberal and enlightened projects, as. for Instance, In connection with the appointment of Jewish officers to regiments, by the restrictions imposed upon him by the terrra of the constitution; while, on tha other hand, the late Queen Victoria and her suc cessor. King Edward, have never exposed them selves to any charge of abuse of their power of dismissal of officers of the army and navy without Judicial hearing, being guided In this as in other matters by a tactful appreciation of the will of the people. MARQUISE DE FONTENOT. J. D. ROCKEFELLER. JR.. ON WIVES. "Get Married Early," He Saya, "But Be Careful in Your Selection." John D. Rockefeller, Jr., offered some advice as to the choosing of a wife in his talk to his Bible claas at tho Fifth Avenue Baptist Church yesterday. He also advised the members to gret married as Boon as possible, expressing an opin ion that a wife, provided she was the right kind, was one of the best assets a young man could acquire. Several of th« members of the Bible class are married men, and these nodded their heads vig orously In approval cf their leader's remarks (although nonq of their respective wives were present), while the unmarried men listened with eager attention. "In selecting a wife, he sure tr» get the right kind." said Mr Rockefeller. "There is hardly any question more Important than the choice of a helpmate. A man's wife can cither make a man or mar a man's whole life. I have known young men whoso promlßing careers were ppolled by an unwise selection in this respect. If a young- man Is eager to lead a life of righteousness and to devote himself to Christian eei-vlce. and he takes unto himself a wife whose thoughts are absolutely frivolous and selfish, the result will be disastrous. "Get married as soon as you cm. but be sure to select a wife who shares your attitude toward life. The other kind of woman w ill lead you to ruin. "In starting out In life every young man must makfl his choice. You must decide whether your life shall be devoted to the pursuit of .st-lf ish gain or to the service of the Lord. That Is the great fundamental choice which confronts every young man. Shall he go in for Christian service or for materialism, v.hich soon or late must force a. man to break away from the ties of the Church?" 1 H. Troxell, the president of the cln^s, has been re-elected to that office. Mr. Rockefeller yes terday warmly praised him for his good work and ' nngratulateii the class upon his re-election.

December 15. ARMY OFFICERS TO SEE WORLD.— Secretary ' Taft believes there should be encouragement of the army to travel in foreign countries, and to this end he la In favor of legislation to bo Incorporated In the Army Appropriation bill this session which shall have the effect of regarding officers as on de tached service during certain parts of leaves of absence granted officers who are on duty In the Philippines. Hitherto officers attached to stations at a distance from Manila have been obliged to take the interlsland transports, and much time la really wasted in petting to and from Manila, If ' this period, sometimes extending over a fortnight, could be taken out of the officers' leave and re paided as a period of detached service. It would give more time for officers in the Far East to travel and see something of other countries, and perfect themselves in foreign languages. This concession to officers will have to be granted by act of Con gross, and It is expected that there will he no op position to this supK«stlon of tha Secretary of War . under the circumstances. I NAVAL. STAFF RELlEF.— Nothing will be at- | tempted by tha Navy Department authorities In i the course of the present session of Congress, If present indications count for anything, toward ob taining legislation which will relieve the situation ; for the members of the staff corps of the navy. The recommendations from the various boards re- I ferring to different staff corps were not in entire aprtenent. and this was why. In a short session of Congress, there need be no attempt to reconcile the differences. It is possible, of course, that the staff officers themselves, who are interested in ob- i taining certain things, such as promotion after thre») years for the assistant paymasters and a re- j grading of the civil engineers, will seek to obtain : the legislation Independent of a departmental meas ure. This might stand some chance of Congres sional approval were It not that there is little time In which to work projects of this kind through tne naval committees, especially when a great part or the committee consideration must be given up to the regular appropriation bill. The President's special message on the naval personnel, which ho will send in early next week, probably on "Monday, will make no reference to the staff corps, and It is considered that much of importance to the service will be accomplished If Congress enacts the con templated legislation in behalf of the naval lin^. 

WORTH OF, OFFICER'S WORD— corre- j epondence has been exchanged between a captain j of Infantry, who was detailed as surveying: officer j to fix the responsibility for the loss of certain ! public property, and the quartermaster general of the army, on whose records tho property was car- ' ried The quartermaster general insisted on having an affidavit from the surveying officer, who de clined to give it. and stated that he felt it unneces sary to furnish more than a certificate covering 1 the facts in the case. The correspondence became > spirited, and the War Department has had to take ! action in the matter, to the extent of calllnsr the ' Junior officer to account and rendering a formal de- ■ cision that the quartermaster general Is entirely ■within his riphtp when he insists upon affidavits instead of certificates from officers detailed to con duct purveys of lost or damaged property. Not only was this information Riven by thr department, but the surveying officer was informed that he had subjected hlms<lf to disciplinary measures on ac count of Insubordination. CALLS ARTILLERY WEAK.] General Murray Says It Could Not Give Reasonably Good Service. Washington. Dec. 16. — "Both the coast and th<i field artillery are badly deficient In both per sonnel and material: neither Is In even approxi mately proper condition for Instruction In time of peace, much less In condition for reasonably efficient service In war, and the time necessary : to put either In the latter condition Is not a ' matter of days or weeks, but of years." Brigadier General Arthur Murray, chief of artillery, thus eums up the condition of his arm of the service In his annual report, which Is made publlo to-day, and In which he says It cannnt be too strongly urged that appropriate legislation be obtained to make good the de ficiencies and to correct the defects referred to. The total coat of the present system of coast defence of the United States to February 27 last r General Murray says, was $72,760,853. and the estimated cost to complete the defence of tho United States, including" estimates for am munition and cost of sites, is $50,879,339. From theeo tlgures the deduction 13 made that con siderably more than half the work of coast de fence has been completed. The three elements of defence most needed, vrhlch will give th»i greatest measure of public safety at the least cost. General Murray says, are the completion of the Installation of the approved tsysiom of range and position finding for all guns mounted, the providing of necessary searchlights for harbor defence at night and the completion of the submarine mine equipment of all fortified harbors. ' The proper defence of insular ports. It Is esti mated, will cost $19,573,895, and the entrance to the Panama Canal, $4, 8.7. 682.
