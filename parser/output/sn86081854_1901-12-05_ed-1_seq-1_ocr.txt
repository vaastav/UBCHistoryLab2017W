HENDERSON IS AGAIN SPEAKER Sessions In House and Senate Were of Routine Nature and Brief—Presi dent's Message Will Be Read To morrow. Washington, Dec. 2. —The Fifty-sev enth congress opened today, and will fn all likelihood be one of the busiest and most important sessions ever held, i Ten years ago a billion-dollar congress furnished the text for the economists, i The record for the coming congress will be mce nearly two billion dollars, j so vast been the growth of the country and Its needs. If for no other reason than for the liberal expendi tures to be made for public works, the present congress will be remarka ble. But it will have other claims as a history-maker if, as now seems prob able, provision is made for starting the construction of the inter-oceanic C'Eliut. One of the first measures of national Interest which will be introduced in this session will be a resolution look ing to public action concerning the death of President McKinley. This will be presented tomorrow by either Senator Foraker or Senator iianna, probably the former, and after its in troduction the senate will adjourn im mediately as a mark of respect to the memory of the dead President. The annual message of President Roose velt will not be received until tomor row, and on this account the session of today was exceedingly brief. Wed nesday and Thursday will be devoted to the introduction of new bills, and as usual there will be a llood of them. Among the first bills of importance to be presented will be the ship sub sidy bill, which will be introduced by Senator Frye, and the Nicaragua Canal bill, which Senator Morgan will present. The program for the opening day in the house today, ulthough it fol lowed rigidly routine precedents, was interesting and to a certain extent picturesque. Admission to the galler ies was by card, of which two had been issued to each member, and they were crowded to their full capacity. The desks of the popular members were laden with flowers. The clerk of the house called the members to order at noon, and after prayer by the chaplain the roll was called by states. General Henderson was elected speaker and escorted to the chair by a committee. After he addressed the house, Mr. Bingham, of Pennsylvania, "the Father of the House," a titular honor bestowed upon the oldest mem ber in point of continuous service, ad ministered the oath to him. Senator Penrose and Representative Wanger, of Pennsylvania, will intro duce bills for the acquisition of Val ley Forge and its incorporation Into a national park as a memorial of one of the most historic places In revolu tionary days. The measures will be practically the same as those Intro duced In the senate and house re spectively last year, and will provide for an appropriation of $200,000 for park purposes. The project has the earnest indorsement of 27 patriotic associations, including both organiza tions of the Sons and Daughters of the Revolution, the Colonial Dames and the Junior Order of American Mechanics. Small-Pox in Schuylkill County. Pottsville, Pa., Dec. 2. —Dr. A. H. Halberstadt, of this city, state medical inspector of Schuylkill county, reports small-pox as alarmingly epidemic in this county. According to the latest information the disease is at Auburn and six cases are at Port Clinton Thomas Kirk, of Philadelphia, who is visiting at St. Clair, is down with a most violent form of the disease. At Tamaqua several cases have developed and the town is alarmed because of the fact that nearly 200 people who went with the Tamaqua football team to Hamburg last Thursday stopped at the Port Clinton Station, and the station agent and his assistant, who were taken violently 111 with small-pox, min gled freely among them, probably scat tering the germs. The alarm at Ta maqua Is so great that on Saturday 600 people were vaccinated and the doctors ran out of vaccine matter. Died in Church. Lancaster, Pa., Dec. 2. —Yesterday morning while attending services in the First M. E. Church, Walter A. Haldy, cashier of the Lancaster County National Bank, suddenly became Hi and died a few minutes later in the vestry room, to which he had been hastily removed. Death was due to rheumatism of the heart. Deceased was 51 years old, and is survived by his wife and two children. 

AFFAIRS IN PHILIPPINES Tha Financial Situation la Causing Conaiderable Alarm. Manila, D«c. 2. —The financial sit uation Id the Philippine Islanda la causing considerable alarm. In an interview published in Manila Henry C. Ide, chief of the department of finance and justice, referred to the probable enforcement of an alteration in the immediate future, of the present government parity of two Mexican dollars for one gold dollar. The Uni ted States post office here now refuses to issue money orders in exchange for Mexican silver, except to government employes. The banks of Manila have been making from 6 to 8 per cent, on exchange. The commercial com munity had relied upon the United States Philippine commission to con tinue the situation of two Mexican dollars for one gold dollar, which the commission itself created. The com mission is unable to act in the matter without the authority of congress. Charles A. Conant, special commis sioner of the war department to Inves tigate the state of coinage and bank ing in the Philippines and report to the secretary of war recommendations for remedial legislation, who Is now in Washington, was the bearer of the commission's views on this matter. Th stores of Manila are compelled to accept two Mexican dollars for one gold dollar, while Chinese speculators are paying as high as 6 per cent, pre mium in American paper money for American gold. Local bankers say that if the salaries of all insular em ployes were paid in the local or Mex ican currency, independently of the fluctuations of this currency, and If the government had not attempted to enforce a rate of exchange, the pres ent financial situation would never have arisen. The miltary departments of north ern and southern Luzon have ceased to exist. Major General James F. Wade, formerly in command of the southern department. left Manila to day to assume rorr.Tnacil of tiic .V.r'ri can forces on Cebu Island, and Major General Lloyd Wheaton, formerly commander of the northern depart ment, will take command of the de portment of the North Philippines. Several small engagements have oc curred in Hatangas provinc- in the last few days. The forces of the insurgent leader Caballos have become badly demoralized. His followers are broken tip into several small bands. Caballos holds two American prisoners.

Y FIRE: DESmiVS FAMILY 11 Mother and Four Children Perish in Burning Home. | HEAT DROVE RESCUERS BACK : | Screams of Victims Heard Above Roar ; of Flames—Husband Nearly Crazed With Grief and Is Destitute—Cause of Fire Is Unknown. Altoona, Pa.. Dee. 2. —Between 1 »nd 2 o'clock yesterday morning five persons, a mother and her four chil dren. were burned to death at Gwin Station, on the Wopsononock railroad, three miles north of this city. The husband escaped. THE DEAD. MRS. MARY C. BURK, 42 years old. ADAM OUST AVE BI'RK, 16 years old. MARY E. BURK, 13 years old. JOANNA BURK, 11 years old. JOSEPH VICTOR BURK, 8 years old. Ca,rl W. Burk, the husband, is burned about, the back seriously, but not fatally. Mrs. Burk and the children, save Adam, retired at the usual hour on Saturday night. Mr. Burk, who was in Altoona. did not get home until late. The lamp was burning in the kitchen for him. Before he went up stairß he turned it low. A lunch was left for Adam on the kitchen table, who is a stage hand at the Altoona Opera House. It is not known what time he turned In. About 1.30 o'clock Mrs. Burk was awakened by a dense smoke in her room. She awoke her husband. He dressed hurriedly and hastened down stairs. Opening the kitchen door, he found that the room was ablaze. The draft caused by the open door accen tuated the Are, and with a roar the flames swept through the house. Burk's cloth'ns? was limited, and he I sprang outside and rolled in the snow | to extinguish the tiny tongues of fire i that in a moment were licking nain j fully at his flesh. He then sutnm :ned j the assistance of the neighbors. There i was no hope of saving the house when | they arrived. To rescue the inmates was impossible, for every time they : tried to enter the intense heat drove them back. Burk, in a mad frenzy, tried to rush through the flames, but was prevent j ed. it would have beeu sure death. Meantime the agonizing screams of | the inmates could be heard above the ! roaring of the Are and the crackling ! of the burning timbers. For one brief | second Mrs. Burk appeared at an up j stairs window, in her arms she car ' ried a child. Then the flames arose | around and about her. and sh? sank | back and was seen no more. The i neighbors gathered outnirle wore hor j rifled and turned away. Burk was i mercifully sent away to the hcspltal j about this time, crazed with grief. I The house, which was a two story j frame structure, was soon consumed I and the search of the ruins com ! menced. As there was nothing left but j the foundation stones, the bodies, charred and blackened, were speedily : recovered. One corpse could not be 1 distinguished from the other. They ! were brought to a morgue in this | city. The tire lobbed Burk of his family 1 and all his personal property. He Is left without a penny. lie escaped scantily clothed. He is so destitute ; that the funeral expenses of hi* loved ones will have to l>o heme by the county. The kitchen stove shows evidences of a hot Are, but the goner 1 opinion seems to be that Adam to:\?ot to put out the lamp when he retired, and the family dog, in search of something to • apppease his hunger, upset the lamp. West Point, 11; Annapolis, 5. 'Philadelphia, Dec. 2.—On Satu day in the presence of 30.000 spectators, including President Roosevelt and many government official*, the West Point football team defeated Anrapo | lis by a score of 11 to 5. West Point j caught a Tartar in the Navy farj. i Such a magnificent exhibition of ?ack ! ling as given by Annapolis on Frank lin Field has rarely been seen. Two surprises were afTorded, the spirited 1 offense of the Middies and the sle py, 1 unconcentrated defense of the Army ' lads. The Middies' eleven se«.mod timed to a higher chord than the Army's. Yet they could not r«ach the supreme key of the soldiers. Daly, , West Point's quarterback, playe.i one of the greatest games ever sen in this city. Said President Should Be Shot.
