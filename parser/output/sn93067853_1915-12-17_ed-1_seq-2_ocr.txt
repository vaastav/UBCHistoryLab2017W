The president tells how this country j practiced neutrality and declares that i he hopes that when the time comes j for readjustment and recuperation this country will be of iutiuitc service. Re- c ferring to Central and South American 1 problems, the president declares that c we should retain unnbnted the spirit ( which has inspired us throughout the r whole life of our government and i which was so frankly put into words i by President Monroe. t We have been put to the test in the i case of Mexico, and we have stood the 1 test Whether we have benefited Mex- < Ico by the course we have pursued re- c mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in t her own hands. But we have at least c proved that we will not take advan- ^ tage of her ip her distress and under- a take to impose upon her an order und ? government of our own choosing.

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT, Economic Adjustments Inevitable Within the Next Generation. The morul is that the states of Aiuer i ku are not hostile rivals, but co-op crating friends, and that their growing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give tbem a new significance as factors In Interna tlonul affairs and In the political history cf *he world. It presents them us in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking together, quick with common sympathies and Common ideals. Separated, they arc subject to all the cross currents of the confused polities of a world of hos tile rivalries: united In spirit and purpose. they cannot he disappointed of their i?eaceful destiny. This Is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it.

(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.) >f Individual liberty and of the free abor that supports life and the uu:ensored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our eckoning or agreeable to our prlucl)les. But just because we demand tinuolested development and the uudisurbed government of our own lives ipon our owu principles of right and iberty, we resent, from whatever juarter it may come, the aggression we urselves will not practice. We insist ipou security in prosecuting our self boson lines of national development. >Ve do more than that. We demand it ilso for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty and ree national development to the incilents and movements of affairs which iffect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk n these difficult paths of independence tnd right. From the first we have nade common cause with all partisans >f liberty on this side the sea and have leemed it as important that our neighK>rs should be free from all outside lomtuatlon as that \ye ourselves should >e; have set Amerioa aside as a whole ttfthe uses of Independent nations and political freemen." ^ Out of such thoughts grow all our olicles. We regard war merely adu neans of asserting the rights of a peoile against aggression. And we are a fiercely jealous of coercive or dictaorlal power within our own nation s of aggression from without. We vill not maintain a standing army esept for uses which are as necessary n times of peace as in times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. ncreaso Standing Regular Force?Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war lias never been a mere mater of men and guns. It is a thing if disciplined might. If our citizens ire ever to fight effectively ujion a udden summons, tliey must know low modern fighting is done, and what o do when the summons comes to ender themselves immediately availible and immediately effective. And he government must be their servant j a this matter, must supply them with lie training they need to take care of hemselves and of it The military trm of their government, which they vill not allow to direct them, they may iroperly use to serve them and make heir independence secure, and not netr own Independence merely, hut he rights also of those with whom hey have made common cause, should hey also he put In jeopardy. They mist he fitted to play the great role n the world, and particularly In this [ lemisplicrc. for which they are quail | led hy principle and by chastened am dtion to play.

These MESSAGE Declares That if Full Navy Program Is Carried Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Borders. are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for its present duties. duties which Ut has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts nnd borders and at our interior army posts, but also In the Philippines. In the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus nud In Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens, raised In increments of 133,000 a year turougnout n period or tnree years. This it Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to Berve with the colors for purposes of training for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an addition*! "furlough"'period of three years. This force of 400.000 men would be provided with personal nccouterments as fast ns enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assembled for training at stated intervals at convenient places In association with suitable units of the regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call.
