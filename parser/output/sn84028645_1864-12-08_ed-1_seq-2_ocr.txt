"!, , OLUMBIT8, OinO i , TnuKsnAT5ioa2n3ra; r- dec. s.' The President's Message. r Predld6iit Lincoln' annual mcseago will be found in our columns this morning. Kyi(Jcntly,1t was not written by the Fresl jlen't himself. It is more smoothly w ritteu than any document tlie paternity of which ha-eeattributed:to him. Its brevity will command for it general-perusal. The condition of our foreign affairs is summed tip in the statement that they are "renson Mlf satisfactory." We are, however, tn '!brmMl that unforseen political difficulties have arisen, and especially in Brazilian and British ports and on theNorthern boundaries the Utilted States, which have required, iod arc likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance and a just nd conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States; as, well as the nations con . cemed and their governments." Uirect . reference is not made to the Florida 'affair;'," but', this sentence furnishes conclusive evidence, that the .Adiniu istratlon will tenuer to the Brazilian Government whatever apology she may 'ask touching that affair. Clearly, we are hot In a cohdition to provoke the Ill-will of any foreigu Government at this time, and .hence . we shall be uudcr the necessity of occasionally pocketing insults and npolo- . glzing for things that uudcr more favorable circumstances we should be very far from 'doing. ; Our finances arc in that favorable condi tion as to require a further increase of our 'already bnrthensome taxation, and the is sue of additional Government issues, that shall be exempt from taxation and seizure , for debt, is recommended. The extinction of State Banks is suggested as a necessity and as a good. Of course, everything in the shape of. State institutions and State sovereignty, in this day, when a strong, Imperial Government is advocated, should ' not be tolerated. But what of the Rebellion ? This is the . question that is uppermost in the minds of the great mass of-the people. Does the Message convey the idea that it is in the throes of total extinction that it is about to draw its last gasp ? ,' No? We are told that we have advanced beyond the positions we held last year, ami that Shbrmak is driving through Georgia; but a conjecture as to the result of that ex pcdltion is' not ventured. An argument "is,however, based upon the vote given nt the Presidential election on the 8th of Ko- 'Vembef last," that . we arc abundantly able of prosecuting the war indefinite ly. To ' people who are subject to ' do "'military duty and who have" a dread of, drafts this will be any thin; . else than consolatory. It antagonizes the assurances given to the people by the friend of Mr. Lincoln before the election, that his - re-election would cause a speedy termina tion of the war. Capable of prosecuting the war indefinitely, without seeking to ter initiate it by negotiation, we may be ; but it la questionable whether that Is the desire , of the people. ; The abolition of slavery throughout the United States by an amendment to the Con stitution is again urged upon Congress, and a determination to adhere Inflexibly to the ( emancipation proclamation is avowed. Di gested of all extraneous matter, Mr. lax 'coln's position is, that war must be prose cuted until the rebels abolish slavery and i lay down their arms. Under this Admiu- titration, peace Is to be secured ou no other terms, "We can, therefore, with certainty 1 predict that the war will continue at least J our y eara longer. - Radicalism Jubilant. . The Cincinnati Gazette' Washington City f special, tinder date of the Cth hist., 6tated that "Radicalism at the Capital is jubilant." tTbe cause for this jubilant feeling was the appointment of Chasb as Chief Justice of the United States, and the decided Aboli- tkn tone of the President's Message. When Radicalism has cause for" rejoicing, Con servatism has cause for extreme mortiftca tlon. - This appointment and this Message will, undoubtedly, cause Jeff. Davis and his co-confederates to rejoice. We have the testimony of lion. Alexander II. Stk phins, that Jeff. Davis, and men of that class in the South, desired the re-election of Lincoln, and Roger A. Pktor, a few days ago, alter he had been taken prisoner and was put through a course of examination, also tes- - .tiflad mat tne re-eleciiuu uf Lincoln bad Lmore firmly united the South in their op position to the Federal Government. Al most from the commencement of this un- . fortunate, war the policy adopted, from 'time to time; add noW maintained, by the Administration, has been to unite the South more closely in their determination to pros ecute the rebellion until such time as they e shall achieve their independence. Crask's appointment as Chief Justice and the Presi dent'! renewed determination to prosecute , the war until slavery shall have been abol ished, give strength and solidity to the re- i hellion, and because they do this conserva tive people .have cause for poiguant mortl- ,'licfttlon. -..;. ...

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FeUow-thitent'of the Senate 1 '" ! ; ' and Uuwteot Representative L ! Again the blessings of health and abun- j danfrharvests claim our proloundcst grati tude to Almighty God. -'. . ;"t Tlie condition Of our foreign aflairs.ls reasonably satisfactory. Mexico continues to be a theatre of civil war. While our political relations with that country have undergone no change, we have, at the same time," strictly maintained neutrality be tween the belligerents. At the request of the States of Costa Rica and Nlcarauga, a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a source of much sulU'actiou that the difficulties which for a moment excited -some political apprehensions, and caused a closing; of the iuter-oceanic transit route, have been admirably adjusted, and that there Is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capaci ty and adaptation. We could not exagger ate either the commercial or the political Importance of that great Improvement. It would be doing Injustice to an important North American State, not to acknowledge the directness, frankness and cordiality with which the United States of Columbia have entered into intimate relations with 'this Government. , ,; A claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861. Tlie new liberal constitution of Venezuela, having gone into cll'ect with the universal acqui escence of the people, the Government un der It has been recognized, and diplomatic intercourse with it has been opened In a cordial and friendly spirit. The loug de ferred Aris Island claim has been satisfac torily paid and discharged. Mutual pay ments have been made of the claims award ed by the late Joint Commission for the settlement of claims between the United Kt.it-pa unit Pa. An earnest and cordial menusmp continues to exist between the two countries, ana sum euorts as were in mv nower, have-been used to remove mis understanding and avoid a threatened war between r eru ana tpain. . Our-relations are of tho most friendly nature with Chill, the Argentine Republics of Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti. During tlie past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any ot these Republics ; and on the other hand, their sympathies witn tne unueu States are constantly ex pressed. The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian, in 1861, has been paid in full by the Government of uriir.. Civil war continues In the Spanish port of San Domingo, apparently without pros pect or an early close, uniciat correspon dence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that Republic. It might be expected to derive new vigor from American influence, improved by tho rapid disappearance ot slavery in the United States. I solicit your authority to furnish the Republic with a gunboat, at a moder ate cost, to be reimbursed to tlie Uaited States by installments. Such a vessel is . needful tor the safety of that State against the native African races, and in Liucmn hands it would be more etl'eciive in arrest ing the African slave trade. 'than a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least organized naval force would stimu late a generous ambition in the Republic; and the confidence which we should mani fest by furnishing it, would win forbearance and favor towards the Colony, from all civ ilized nations. Tlie proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, by tlie way of Beh ring's Straits, and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last ses sion, lias been undertaken under very fa vorable circumstances, by an association of American citizens, with tne eoruiai good will and support, as well of this Govern ment as of tiiose of Great Britain and Rus sia. Assurances have beon - reeaivud from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise, and their readiness to co-operate In construct ing lines tributary to that world-eucircling communication, ' ' 1 learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communica tion between tlie eastern coast of America and Great Britain, has been renewed, with full expectation of its early accomplish ment. Thus it is hoped that with the re turn of domestic peace, the country will be able to resume, with energy and advantage, her former high career of commerce and civilization. Our very popular and estimable Repre sentative in Egypt, died In April last. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent ot the otllce and the government of the Pacha, resulted in a suspension of intcrcouse. The evil was promptly corrected on tlie arrival ot the MiuctTMiur in the Consulate, and our rela tions with Egypt, as well as ouFrelntionj with theBarbary powers, are entirely satis factory. The rebellion which has so long been fla grant in China, has at last been suppressed, with the co-operating good ollices of this Government and of the other western com mercial States. The Judicial Consular es tablishment has become very difficult and onerous; and it will need legislative restric tion to adapt it to the extension of our com merce and to the more intimate intercourse whicli has been instituted with the Govern ment and people ot that vast empire. China seems accepting, with hearty good will, the conventional laws which regulate commerce and social intercourse among tlie Western nations. Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous form ot its government, the action of that Em pire in preserving treaty stipulations, is in consistent and capricious; nevertheless, go.od progress has been effected by tlie Western powers moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been re-opened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased, rather than diminished, the friendship of Japan towards the United States. The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina and Peusacola, have been opened by proclama tion. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports, than It Is to pur sue through many hazards, and at vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occu pation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade. For my part, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in tlie United States. If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the au thority of law, or ought to be further regu lated, I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domiciles and facili ties for their criminal occupation in our country. It is possible that if it were a new and open question underconslderation, the maritime powers, with the light they now enjoy, would not concede the privil eges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute as they are, and always have been, equally of ships and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less assiduous nor more successful, during the. last year than they were before that time, in their efforts, under' favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and the determination of the maritime States to defeat that design, are believed to be sincere. Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, and especially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary ot the United States, which have required and are likely to continue to require the practice of constant vigilance and a just and con ciliatory spirit on the. part of the United States, as welt as ot the nations concerned aud their governments. Commissioners have been aptwinted un der the treaty with Great Britain, on the adjustment ol the claims ot the Hudton Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Com panies in Oregon, aud are now proceeding to the execution of the trust, assigned to them. .: . In view of the Insecurity of life in there- plou adjacent to tho Canadian' border, by recent assaults ana depreciations, commit ted by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there; it has been thought proper to give notice that, atter me expira tion of six months, the previous condition ally stipulated time in the existing rela tions with Great Britain, tho United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes, if they should find that proceeding necessary. The etmclitlon of the border will necessari ly come into consideration in connection with tlie question of continuing or modify ing the rights .of. travel ..from Canada through the United States, s well as.the regulation of imports which were tempora rily established bv the reciprocity treaty of tlie fifth of June." 1854.' I desire however, to be understood, while making this state ment, that the colonial authorities are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or tin1 friendly towards the United States, but on the contrary there is every reason to expect that with the approval of tho imperial Gov ernment, they will take the necessary meas ures to prevent new incursions across the border The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of emigration has, as far as was possible, been put. into operation, p. seems to need an amendment which will enable the officers of the Government to pre vent the practice of frauds against the im migrants while on their way, and on their arrival In our ports, so as to secure them hero a free choice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition to wards this great national policy is manifest ed by most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated oivonr part by giv ing the immigrants effective national' pro tection. I regard our emigrants as ond of the principal replenishing streams wuicn are appointed by Providence to repnlr the ravnges of internal war. and its wastes of national strength nnd health.'' All that is necessary is to secure the flow-of that stream in its present fullness, and to that eud the Government must in every way make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country. The financial affairs of tho Government have been successfully administered. Du ring the last year the requisition of the last session ot Congress lias materially attcctcu the revenue, although sufficient, time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect or several or the provisions or the acts of Congress imposing Increased taxation. The receipts during the year from all sources upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance iii the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1863, were 91,894,790,007 (ii and the aggregate disbursements upon the same basis were 1.2'J8.0oG, 101 89, leaving a balance in tlie Treasury, as shown by war rants, $!K5.7:W.905 73. Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed, mid the amount of Issues in substitution therefor, and tho nc tual cash operations of the Treasury were, receipts, -84.07G,64G 77, and disbursements $05,234,087 80, wtiich leave a cash balance in the Treasury of $ 18.312,!)03 01. Of tho receipts, there were derived from customs, $102,310,152 99; from lands, $583,133 29; from direct taxes, $175 04S.900; from inter national revenue, $109,741.18-1 10; from mis cellaneous sources, $17,511,413 10; from loans applied to accumulated expenditure, including former balance, $023,413,929 73. There were disbursed for civil service. $27,505,599.40; for Pensions and Indians, $7,517,930.97; for tlie War Department $00, 791.842 97; for the Navy Department $85, 733.292.79; fortius interest ou the public debt $53.085.421.09 making an aggregate of $-05,231,087.80, and leaving a balance in the Treasury of $18,842.558 71, as before stated. For the actual receipts and disbursements lor the first quarter, and the estimated re ceipts and dishursements for the three re maining quarters Of the fiscal year and the general business ot the Treasury in detail. I referyou to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I concur with him in tlie opinion that the proportion of th, moneys required to meet tho expenses concurrent upon the war, derived from taxation, should be still further increased, and I earnestly in vite your attention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall he required to meet tlie justexpecta tions of tlie Secretary. The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the b 'oks of the Treasury, amounted to one billion, seven hundred and forty thousand millions six hundred and ninety thousand four hundred and eighty-nine dollars and forty-nine cents. Probably, should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from five hun dred millions.' Held as it is, for the most part, by our own people, it has been a sub stantial branch of national, though private property. For obvious reasons, tlie more equally this proiert.y can bo distributed among all the people, the better. To favor such general distribution, greater induce ments tfi become owners might, perhaps, with good effect and without Injury, be pre sented to persons of limited menus. With this view, I suggest whether it might not be bot'i expedient and compe tent for Congress to provide that a limited amouutof eotnefutiire issue of public securities might be held by any fcoita fide purchaser exempt from taxa tion and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions aud limitations as might be nec essary to guard against abuse of so impor tant a privilege. This would enable pru dent persons to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of waut. Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities to the amount limited, most desirable to every person of small means, who might be able to save enough for tlie purpose. Tlie great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors, with re lation to the public debt, is obvious; men readily perceive that they cannot bo much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves. - The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding the es timate ot the Secretary of the Treasury, made to Congress at the commencement of the lost session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made In the preceding De cember, as to Its probable amount at the beginning of this year by the sum ot $3,995,t 070.!t.1. The first exhibits n satisfactory condition and conduct ot the operations of the Treasury, lne national banking sys tem Is proving to be acceptable to capital ists anil to the people. On the 25th of No vember 534 National Banks had been or ganized, a considerable number of which were conversions from State banks. Chang es from the State system to the national system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in tlie United States no bank of issue not author ized by Congress, and no bank-note circu lation not secured by the Government. That tho Government and the people will derive general benefit from this change In the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The national system will create a reliable and permanent Influ ence in support of the national credit, and protect the people against losses ln the use of paper money. Whether or not any fur ther legislation is advisable for the suppres sion ofState bank Issues, it will be for Con gress to determine, ft seems quite clear that the Treasury cannot be satisfactorily conducted, unless the Government can ex ercise a restraining power over the bank note circulation of the country. The report, of the Secretary of War, and the accompanying documents, will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several ad ministrative bureaus of the War Depart ment during the last year It will also spec ify the measures deemed essential for the national defense and to keep up and supply the required military force. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of, the affairs of that Department and of the naval service. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast pro portions has bceri- organized in so brief a period and conducted wlth so uiiifh efficien cy and success. The geperal exhibit of the navy, Including vessels under construction, on tho first of December. 1804, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4.010 guns and 610,398 tons, being an actual Increase during the year, ove and above nil losses by shipwreck or In battle, of 83 vessels, 107 guns and 42.427 tons. The total num ber of men nt this time In the naval service, including officers. Is about 61,000. There have been captured by the navy during the year, 324 vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1,300, of which 207 arc steamers. Tho gross proceeds arising from the sale of con demned prize property thus far reported, amount to $14,396,250 51. - A large amount of such proceeds Is still under adjudication and yet to bo reported. - --r- m Tlio total expenditures of the Navr De partment, ot every description, Including the cost of tlie Immense squadrons that have been called Into existence from tho 4th of March, 1801. to the 1st of November, 1804, are $238,647,202 35. Your favorable con sideration is Invited to the various recom mendations of the Secretary of the Navy, and especially in regard to a Navy Yard, and a suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels and the machinery and armature for our ships, to which refer ence was made iu my last annual message. Your attention is also Invited to tho view s expressed In the report, in relation to tho legislation of Congress, at its last session, in respect to prizes on our inland water. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to tho propriety of creat lug tlie new rank of Vicc-Admiral In our naval service. - - Your attention Is Invited to the report of the Postmaster-General, for a detailed ac count of the operations and financial condi tion of the Post Olllce Department. The postal revenue for the. year ending June 30th, 1804. amounted to $12,438,252.78, and tlie expenditures to $12,614,780.20; the ex cess of expenditures over receipts being $200,05242. ' The views presented by the Postninstcr-General on the subject of spe cial grants by the Government and of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships, and of tho policy he recom mends for the development of increased commercial-itercourse with adjacent in dependent neighboring countries, should receive the careful consideration of Con gress. It is of noteworthy interest that the steady exnanslon of population, Improve ment and Governmental Institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked, much lcsa tniiipdnil or drst roved bv our irreat civil war. which, at first glance, would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation. The organization and admission of tho State of Nevada has been completed In con formity with law; and thus our excellent system is firmly established In the moun tains, which once seemed a barren and un inhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of tho Pacilic ocean. Tho terri tories of tlie United States are generally in n condition of prosperity and rapid growth. Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and the interruption of com munication : with them by Indian hos tilities, have been only- partially or ganized, but it 'is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear, whicli will permit their government, like '.Those ot others, to go into speedy and mil operation. As intimately connected with, and promotiveof this material growth of the nation, I ask tlie attention of Congress to tho valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific railroads. 'and mineral discoveries, contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions and other topics of public inter est pertaining to1 his department. Tho quantity of public land disposed of during tlie five quarters ending on tlie 30th of Sep tember last, was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1.588.014 acres were entered under the Homestead law. The remainder was locat ed with military land warrants, agricultu ral scrip cert itieil to States for railroads and sold for cash. The cash receipts from sales and location fees wa $1,094,440. The in come from sales during tlie fiscal yearending June 30th, 1804, was $07,800,721, against $13,607,795 received during tlie preceding year. The aggregate of acres surveyed du ring the year lias been equal to the quanti ty disposed of; and there is open to settle ment about 133,000,000 acres ot surveyed hind. The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacilic States by railway and telegrapli lines, has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of suc cess, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from tlie prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line of tlie road has bceu definitely located for 100 miles westward from tlie initial point nt Omaha City, Nebraska, and a pre liminary location of the Pacilic railroad of California has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great bend of Mucker river, in Nevada. Numerous discoveries of gold, silver and cinnabar mines have been added to many heretofore known, and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains aiid subordinate ranges teem with enter prising labor, whicli is richly remunerated. It is believed that tlie product of the mines of precious metals in that region has, during the year, reached, if not exceeded, $ 100,000, 000 In value. - It was recommended In my last annual message that our Indian system be remod eled. Congress, at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in Calit'ori i i, and it is believed that, under tlie present organ ization, the management of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable suc cess Much yet remains to be done to pro vide fo'r the proper government of the In dians in other parts of the country, to ren der it secure for tho advancing settler and to provide tor the welfare ot the Indians, The Secretary reiterates his recommenda tions, and to them the attention of Congress is inyited. The liberal provisions to Invalid soldiers and sailors of the republic, and to the wid ows, orphans and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle or died of diseases contracted, or of wounds received, In the service of their country, have been diligently administered. There have been added to the pension roils during the year ending the 30th day of June last, the names of 10,770 Invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767, and of navy invalid pensioners 712. Of widows, orphans and mothers, 22,198 have been placed on the army pension rolls and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number ot army pensioners of this class Is 25,433, and of navy pensioners 793. At the beginning of the year the num ber of revolutionary pensioners was 143. Only 13 of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died. The remainder are those who under the law receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers. During the "y ear ending the 30th of June, 1804, $1,504,610 02 have been paid to pensioners of all classes. I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage tlie benevolent institutions of the District of Columbia, which have hitherto been established or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer, for information con cerning them, and In relation to the Wash ington Aqueduct, the Capitol, and other matters of local interest, to the report of the cltv. The Agricultural Department, under the 'sunervlsion of its nresent energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly the people's department, in which they feel more direct ly concerned than In any other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress. The war continues. Since tho lost an . nual Message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have Seen nialntalneJ, and our armlet have stead ily advanced, thus liberating the tecloni left in the rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States, have again produced reasonably lair crops. The most remarkable .feature in tho military op erations of the year is Gen. Shermairs at tempted march of , 300 miles directly through the Insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase ot our relative strength,' that our General-ln-Chlef should feel ablo to hold in check every ac tive force of the enemy, aud yet to detach a well supported large army to move on such an expedition. The result not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged, important movements nave ulen npiMin-prf flin loi? the vcftr. to the effect of moulding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete suc cess, it is so much in the right direction that twelve thousand citizens in each ot the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have or ganized loyal State Governments with free Constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain nnd administer them. The movement in the same direction, more ex tensive though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, should not bo overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and union tor all the fu ture. The creniuB of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit being driven out, it may seen to tear ner, but it will woo her no more. , . At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment ot the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States pass ed the Senate, but failed tor Jack of the re- j quisito two-thirds vote in tlie House of Rep resentatives. Although tho present is the same Congress and nearly the same mem bers, without questioning the wisdom or Fatriotism of those who stood in opposition, venture to recommend tlie reconsideration and passage- of the measure at the present session. Ot course the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election shows almost certainly that the ncxtCon- f ret will pass the measure, if thls'does not. lence there is only a question of time as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. Aud as it is to so go at all events, may . we not agree that the sooner tho better? It is not claimed 'that the election has imposed a duty on Members to change their views, or their votes, any further than, as an addi tional element to be considered, their judg ment may be affected by It. It is the voice of tho people, now for the first time heard upon the question. In a great national crisis like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end, Is very desir ablealmost indispensable ; and yet, no approach to such unanimity is attainable, unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority, simply because It is the will of the majority. In this case, the common end is the main tenance of the Union; and among the means to secure that end, such will, through the election, is most clearly declared lu favor of such constitutional amendment. The most reliable indication of public purpose In, this country, is derived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass, of its result, the purpose of the people within tho loyal States to maintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm, nor more nearly unanimous, than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order witli which the millions of voters met and mingled nt the polls, gave strong assurance of this. Not only all those who Supported the Union ticket, so culled, but a great ma jority of the opposing party, also, may be fairly claimed to entertain, and to be actu ated by, tho same purposes. It is an un answerable argument to this effect, that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There has been much impugning of mo tives and much heated controversy, as to tlie proper means and best mode of advan cing the Union cause; but in the distinct issue of Union or no Union, tlie politicians have shown by their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In awarding the people the fair opportunity of showing, one to another, and to the world, this firmness nnd unanimity of pur pose, the election has been of vast value to tlie national cause. The election has exhibited another fact, not less valuable to be known ; the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources thatof levying men. While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has tilled so many graves, and caused mourning to so many houies, it is some reluT to know that, com- Cared with the surviving, the fallen have ecn so few. Whole corps, and divisions, and brigades, and regiments, have form ed and fought, and dwindling, and have gone out of existence. A great majori ty of tlie men who comprised them are still living. The same Is true of tho na val service. Tlie election returns prove this. So many voters could -not else be found. Tlie States regularly holding elec tions both now and four years ago, to wit : California, Connecticut, Delaware. Illinois. Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts Michigan, Missouri. New York, Ohio, Oregon. Pennsylvania, Rhode Island. Vermont, Western Virginia, and Wisconsin, cast 3,982.011 Tores now, against 3.870,222 cast then ; showing an aggregate now of 3,398,211, to which is to bo addcJ 33,702 cast now, in the new States of Kan sas nnd Nevada, which States did not vote In 1800; thus swelling the aggregate to 4,075,773, and the net Increase during the three yenr3 and a half of war, to 145,751. A table is appended, showiug particulars. To this again should be added the number ot all voters In the field, from Massachu setts Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois and California, who, by the laws of those States, could not vote away lrom their homes, and which number cannot be less than jiincty thousand. Nor vet is this nil. Tho number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years ago; while thousands, white and black, join us as tho national arms press back tlie Insurgent lines. So much Is shown, affirmatively nnd negatively, by the elec tion. It Is not material to Inquire how the Increase has been produced, or to show that It would have been greater, but for the war, which is probably true. The important fact remains demonstrated, that we have more men uow than we had when the war began; that we are not exhausted, nor in process of exhaustion; that we are gaining strength, and may, if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely. This strength, as to men, material and resources, is now more complete and abundant than ever. The na tional resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the national authority is unchanged; and, as we believe, unchangeable. The manner. of continuing tho effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of all the evi dence accessible, It seems to me, that no at tempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader, couldresult In any good. He would accept of nothing short of the severance of the Union, ins declarations to inai eiiect are explicit ond oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves; we cannot voluntarily yield It. Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war. and decided by victory. If we vield. we are beaten. If the South ern people fall him he Is beaten. Either wav it would be the victory and defeat fol lowing war. What is true, however, of hira who beads tne insurgent cause, is os necessarily true of those who follow. Al though he cannot re-acccptthe Union, they ran. Some ot them we know already de sire peace and reunion. The number of 

SUCH uiaf lllvicoau. Alley tan nv mi ment have peace, simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the national mifhorltr undcrthe Constitution. ' After so much the Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The local people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means ot legislation, conference, courts, and votes; operating only lu constitutional and , lawful channels. - Some certain, and other possible questions are, and would be, beyond the Executive power to adjust. For instance, the admission of members into Congress; and whatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive Eower itself would be greatly diminished y the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of fbrfeitnres, however, would still be wthln Executive control. I what spirit and temper this control would be exercised, can be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago, general pardon and am nesty, upon specified terms, were ottered to all except certain designated classes; and it was at tlie same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contem plation of special clemency. During the year, many availed themselves of the gen eral provision; and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some, led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the samo time, also, special pardons have been granted to individuals of tlie ex cepted classes; and no voluntary applica tion has been denied. Thus, practically, tho door hns been for a full yenr, open to all except such as were not in' condition to make free choice; thnj; is, such as were in custody, or tinder constraint. It is still open to nil; but tlie time may come, proba bly will come, when public duty shall de mand that It bo closed, and that, In lieu, more vigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of nrmcd resistance to tho national authority on tlie part of the Insurgents as the only Indispens able condition to ending the waron thepnrt of tho Government, I retract nothing here tofore said as to slavery. I repeat the dec laration made a year ago, that while I re main in my present position, I shall not at tempt to retract or modify the emancipa tion proclamation, norshall I return to slav ery any person who is free by the terms ot that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress. It the-pcoplc should, by whatever mode or means, make it my executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, nnd not I, must be their instrument to perform it. In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say, that the Avar will close on the part of the Government, whenever It shall have ceased on the part of those who
