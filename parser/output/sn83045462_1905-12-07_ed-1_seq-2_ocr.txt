necessary to restore the confidence of the public. The resolution was adopted without oppo sition. The Senate at 2:0B p.m. went Into execu tive session and at 2:19 p.m. adjourned un til Monday. THE HOUSE. Reading of the Panama canal appropria tion bill was resumed In the House of Rep resentatives on the convening of that body today. The first amendment was presented by Mr. Williams. He moved to cut the appro priation from $1?,500,000 to ie.HM.833, stat ing that he had come to the conclusion that this latter sum w.ts sufficient to meet the needs of the commissslon to January 15 next The amount bad been arrived at by tak ing the Indebtedness of the commission, which they had stated as >4.500,000. Ha had added to this the December estimates, amounting to $2,363,338. The point was made by Mr. Tawney that It was Impossible to segregate from the estimates the liability of the commission due in Decefnber on equipment purchased by the commission. It was contended by Mr. Willlama that these supplies were not to be delivered until June, and payment need not be made until delivery. Mr. Tawney held that pay ment might be necessary before delivery, according to the terms of purchase. Mr. Mann (Illinois) raised the point that the total estimates submlted were foi; seven months beginning December 1, and that one-sixth of these estimates, which Mr. Williams proposed to appropriate, would not be sufficient to meet the necessities to January 15. An amendment to that of Mr. Williams was offered by Mr. Prince (Illinois), mak ing the appropriation $10,<>00,000. Basing his argument on the speedy appointment of committees, which, he said, should take up and make a careful examination of the estimates furnished. Mr. Prince was of the opinion that $10,"u0.l'i0 was a sufficient sum to meet all emergency necessities. He also opposed the issuance "of bonds. No bonds had been issued since the Spanish-American war. Resides, he said, there was $i:!6,<*H>, 000 In the treasury and $55,000,000 of gov ernment money In national banks. The question was raised by Mr. Burton (Ohio) as to the necessity of the purchase ui' forty-three steam shovels, costing some thing less than half a million dollars, should it be decided to have the work done by contract. Replying. Mr. Mann stated that the com mission and engineers had reached the con clusion that the equipment estimated for was necessary, no matter how the work was done. The entire appropriation was advocated by Mr. Payne (New York) on the ground that the materials ordered were under hurry orders, and without doubt many de liveries would be made before June HO next. To make the money available would act as a spur to contractors, but to withhold It would he to delay all deliveries until June. Mr. Clark Charges Discrimination. Mr. Clark (Missouri) asked Mr. Hepburn if all or most of the supplies for the canal were not purchased by the New York and Washington purchasing agents, although other agents were located at New Orleans and Takoma. Mr^_Hepburn had no information. Mr. Clark?"How many ships have we"1' "Five." "Wiiy don't some of them ply between New Orleans and Panama?" "I cannot say." "What I want to say Is that in my opin ion discrimination Is being made against al! that territory drained by the Mississippi river, and I maintain that cheaper, all water rates could be made from Pittsburg by way of New Orleans than by New York." Mr Wanger (Pennsylvania) stated that there was a line of steamers plying be tween New Orleans and Colon, but that it did not give rates as advantageous as by the government's own boats from New Y ork. Why don't some of those steamers run from New Orleans?" demanded Mr. Clark. "I understand the port of New Orleans was closed during a part of last season," replied Mr. Wanger. 'You are not the man I want to ques tion," retorted Mr. Clark amid laughter. "1 want to talk to some man who don't want to cut our business and give it all to the New York gang." Amendment Adopted. The'House rejected the amendment of Mr. Williams fixing the amount of the canal appropriation at $I!,S58,333, and adoplod an amendment fixing the amount at $11,000,000. HEARST'S CONTEST.

Thirty-five of the many pension bills In troduced In the House yesterday were passed at the last session of Congress, but the members who introduced them yester day didn't find It out until today. T*e lucky constituents have been enjoying the benefits o' r - ?it bounty, however, and lo ma i.e. House May Pass the Bill Be fore the Holidays. VIEWS AX THE CAPITOL CLAIMED THAT IT WILL GO THROUGH THE SENATE. Measure Drawn by Representative * . .... , - Hamilton in Line With the Recom mendations of the President. It Is quite generally expected at the Capi tol that before the hodJlays the Hamilton bill for the admission of the territories of the southwest as states Into the Union will be passed by the House of Representatives and will be referred to the committee on territories of the Senate. It seems quite certain at this time that the bill to become a law in this Congress in relation to the new states will bear the name of Represen tative Hamilton. 1 he bill is in line with the recommenda tions of the President's message, and makes two states out of the four territories that have long been seeking admission. The House has been Insistent that all of these territories shall be provided for In a bill where any of them is to be cared for. In the last Congress the Senate was in clined to cut down this broad scope of the bill but the friends of the measure now claim that there is an ample number in the Senate to pass a bill in line with the recom mendations of the President. This bill will provide that Indian Territory and Okla homa shall be admitted as one state and ?New Mexico and Arizona as another. Prospects in the Senate. The bill before the Senate last year was lost by a lack of a single vote, resulting from the absence of Senator Aldrich abroad and the Illness of Senator Knox. Not only are both of these senators likely to be on hand when a vote is taken, but the new senators are understood to be, without ex ception, favorable to a speedy settlement of statehood claims. The friends of the bill do not expect that any considerable fight will be made on it in the Senate. The fact that the committee on rules will agree to have the btil given right of way in the Senate will depend upon that committee being satisfied that the measure has a dear road and that it will not consume a great amount of ttme with a ProsPect of passage. All the friends of statehood In the Senate speak extremely hopeful of the outcome and they are anxious to have the Hamilton bill be fore them In order that the active work of secuilng its passage may be begun. Opposition to Prohibition Clause. Capt. Frank Frantz, who is to become territorial _ governor of Oklahoma about January 15, came out today in opposition to the insertion by Congress of a prohibi tion clause in the bill that will admit Ok lahoma and Indian Territory to statehood a- one state. It is claimed that the pressure from prominent men of the territory will to? ^eaP" for Congress to withstand, ? v he 1uestl?n of regulating the t ~ liquors in the new state will be left to the people themselves, that being the fhiD?nC!.i 1 principal newspapers and tne leading men. a.re ?a ereat many men In the territory who favor prohibition," said Capt Frantz, who was a Rough R.der officer lii the regiment with President Roosevelt, n?,ale stfonKly opposed to lt? being re quired by the statehood bill. "The majority'of the people of the two al)pear to be largely In favor of asking Congress to leave this whole matter to the people for settlement, that being a right they think ought to be theirs \ SLrong argument now being used by a good Prohibitionists is that if Congress forces this upon the people It will have the effect of prejudicing them against nrohibl tior., and they will repudiate it at the first opportunity. T.he republican national committeeman i "^republican state chairman of the Indian Territory and many other prominent men of both territories have in the last few weeks informed the President and members of congress that the people are utterly op posed to having prohibition forced upon them by Congress They have heretofore hoped that this question might not come up in the statehood bill at all, and they stll hope so, not desiring to see any question in jected that might interfere with their cher ished desires, but they have come to the conclusion that It is now time to speak ud ana express themselves. The prohibition element of the state has been going ahead securing signatures to pe titions asking that prohibition be required by Congress. It is stated that some of t.ioso who signed the petitions have now changed their minds, fearing that if Con gress does require prohibition it will have the effect of making it obnoxious. It Is the opinion of some constitutional lawyers that the new state would have a right to disregard any requirement of this kind and license the sale of whisky if it desired, and prohibitionists fear that this is Just what wou.d happen. Senator Beveridge introduced today a bill pro\ iding joint statehood for Oklahoma and Indian Ter' >ry and for New Mexico and Arlona. ># .11 Is identical with the one introduceu .. the house by Representative Hamilton of Michigan.

WILLIAMS' TARIFF BILL. Would Reduce Duty Where It is Over 100 Per Cent Ad V .lorem. Representative John Sharp Williams of Mississippi, the minority floor leader, in troduced in the House this morning a bill to reduce the tariff duties on all articles wherever In the aggregate, specific and ad valorem, they amounted to more than 100 per cent, to 100 per cent. He was asked his motive in doing so. and if he had any real idea that the bill could pass. "The President of the United States, as I understand it." he said, "puts his advocacy of protectionism upon the ground that it is r.ght and proper that there should be a duty on imported articles sufficient to make up the difference between the scale of for- I eigrn labor and a right American wage i standard. As tliis Is the last ditch, I I f wouId see by the Introduction ot a bill In this Congress whether or not it was a pretense or a real conviction upon merit those who use It as an argu- 1 9t?kes nie lhat !he labor cost <-f no ar- ? , , J. oan <?ver eIC(*d its entire cost, i I don t believe that any one wlil deny that proportion. I have therefore Introduced a ! bill to reduce the tariff duty wherevor It is over 100 per cent to WO per cent, thus 'eav in# a taxation condition under whic5! un doubtedly not only the whole difference be tween American labor and foreign labor has been made up by a tax upon the con sumer, but where the entire labor cost has been taxed to the consumer." Mr- Williams seems to think that a re publican who is sincere in his advocacy of the tariff upon the Idea that It really does benefit labor, and that the Justification for itu existence is the benefit to labor, must ba satisfied with a tax which includes the entire labor cost of articles imported un 

DOMINICAN TREATY COt. COLTON BEFORE S EH ATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE Col. Colton. controller of Dominica* cus toms, appeared today before the Senate committee on foreign relations to give such Information aa he had relative to conditions In Santo Domingo, to assist the committee In *he consideration of the pending Domin ican treaty. Col. Coltoa's report, it la under stood, is in line with the statements al ready attributed to him, to the effect that the little republic has prospered exceedingly under the peaceful conditions resulting from administration of the cuatoma business by the United States and freedom from revolu tionary movements. The treaty Itself has been discussed freely in Santo Domingo In the newspapers and In the newly elected congress. That body has already made many changes in the text, but, with one exception, these are said to be unimportant and to b? mainly amend ments of the phraseology. The amendment of substance applies to article T, which au thorizes the United States to intervene to preserve order In the republic when called upon by the government. The Dominican congress amended that by providing that such Intervention should occur only when requested by the congress, thereby approxi mating the United States constitutional pro vision relative to calls by state legislatures for the use of federal troops. The motive for the change was a distrust by the Do minican congress of the present executive, who Is said to represent no particular party, not even the conservative element which recently elected a congress of which all but two members were In principle favorable to President Roosevelt's scheme of settle ment of the Dominican foreign debt and claims. If these congressional amendments are ac cepted by Morales the treaty must be re turned to the United States for this govern ment's consideration of the changes, so that considerable delay will be involved In se curing the consummation of the treaty.

HELD FOR GRAND JURY. James Bachus Charged With Raising Money Ordera. James A. Backus, alias Cameron, alias Burke, was today held in $2,000 bond for his appearance before the grand Jury. A hearing was had before United States Com missioner Taylor, ai which several wit nesses from this city and Baltimore were examined in order to prove that Backus raised a money order Issued at Baltimore for 35 cents to $50 and cashed it at the store of Lansburgh & Bro. in this city. Miss Kennah, money order clerk at a Bal timore substation, positively identified Backus as the man who procured the order for 3o cents, and Charles B. Bowden, clerk at Lansburgh's, identified Backus as the man who passed the same order with the amount raised to $50. Tj1? P?st inspectors claim to have positive proof that Backus Is one of a gang I,ostal money order raisers for whom they have been looking for some time. CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS.

GERMAN NAVAL BUDGET. Secretary of Admiralty Explained Items in Bill. BERLIN, Decenrber 7.-In the reichstag today Admiral Von Tlrpitx. secretary of the admiralty, in Introducing the naval bill said that the six large cruisers asked for were primarily for foreign service, the in tention being when enough ships hid been built to place four large cruisers on the foreign stations and relieve them with four others from home. It was not necessary now to designate the stations, as it would depend on circum stances. Germany's sea trade was growing remarkably. To arrange for the protection of that trade and to give a feeling of se curity to Germans a.broad more ships were essential. Small cruisers would not fulfill the purpose. ?uw?i Great Britain, the United States, France and Japan endeavored to have one lame cruiser to each battleship. Germany would not attempt that proportion, but she ou<ht to have one large cruiser to two battleships that when the program calling for tUlrty eisht battleships ls carried out. Germiny ought also to have twenty armored cruisers J ouchlng on the appropriation for sub marine boat experiment, the admiralty sec retary said he was not enthusiastic over submarine boats, but he was convinced that they would be of use within certain narrow CRASH ON WESTERN MARYLAND.

MH LOSECOHTRACTS Union Has a Surprise for the Typothetae. HOT FIGHT PROMISED KIGHT-HOUB LAW FOB OOVBBW MENT WORK. Printers Claim Printing of Official Documents Cannot Be Bone in Long Day 8hops. An important factor was today brought into the great eight-hour contest between the Journeymen printers and the proprietors of private printing establishments who are opposed to the ahorter workday. The factor In question is a considerable amount of government printing that is now being executed by private establishments, some of which, it is said, have declared against the eight-hour workday. Some ot the public printing referred to Is that for the United States Supreme Court, the Court of Claims, the isthmian canal com mission, the Spanish claims commission and much of the stationery and money-order blanks and registered letter work for the Post Office Department. It Is contended by members of the Typo graphical Union that this government work cannot be printed in offices that declare against the eight-hour day. unless Uie spirit and letter of the eight-hour law is violated thereby. The claim Is made that much of the printing mentioned is now being executed In offices that have declared asalnst the shorter work day. A labor leader said to a Star reporter this afternoon that this work properly belongs to the government printing office, and the attention of Con gress will be called to the matter. He also said he understood that it was given out by the several departments without com petition. whereas It should. If given out at all, be let in open market to the lowest bidder. The statement was also made. In connec tion witih this matter, tihat one result of giving the government work to private con cerns was to reduce the yearly aggregate of the expenses of the government printing office. A Many-Sided Contest. Unusual conditions have arisen In connec tion with the printers' eight-hour move ment which Is now being actively agitated by typothetae and typographical unions here and elsewhere. Charges and counter charges are being made, and In some in stances the contest has assumed a trian gular aspect, the parties on the three sides being the Journeymen printers, the typothe tae offices that have declared against the elght-houf day and those that have con sented to give their employes an eight hour workday. Mr. Moore, manager of the Law Reporter Company, which concern has signed an eight-hour contract with the unrion, claim ing to be the first local printing office to do so. said to a Star reporter today that there are thirty-seven printerles in Wash ington that use the union label. He figures out that approximately thirteen of these have either signed eight-hour contracts or intimated their purpose to do so. Journeymen printers cla*m that fifteen label shops have already signed eight-hour contracts with Columbia Typographical Union, not including two offices tiiat are al ready giving their employes the eight-hour day. They also claim that Pearson s office, 8th and D street* was the pioneer shop in Washington in granting the lesser woik day. It was also said by union printers today that the proposition is being considered of establishing in Washington a co-operative printery. similar to that established by the union at Niagara Falls, N. Y-, should sucn a step become necessary in their opinion. Arranging Their Forces. The typothetae offices here, as well as in other cities, are said to be paying on per cent of their pay rolls into the employing printers' funds with which to fight the eight-hour movement. The allegation is made that certain of the typothetae offices here have entered Into a combination to have certain of their concerns grant the eight-hour day, but still retain member ship In the tvpothetae for the purpose ol controlling the label and other trade whlcn Is affected by trades union influences, and keep it within typothetae circles. Also that part of their program is to take work at figures less than those estimated by union bhU ts also stated in printing circles that l the National Typothetae, in Its titanic i struggle, has arranged to Issue 'typothetae working cards to non-union printers who mav join forces as strike-breakers with the employing printers' association. These Typothetae cards will, it is saia, give the holder preference in any printing office under the control of the National Typothetae in all parts of the country over Journeymen who are not possessed of such cards. , , The statement is also made that certain typothetae offices are offering h:gher salaried to union printers to continue in their service and work nine hours a day than it would cost them to carry out the eight-hour work day proposition. Mr. Charles F. Sudwarth of the Sudwarth Printing Company states that he believes a combination lias been entered into against him by certain typothetae offices because of his repeated declination to become a party to the fight against the eight-hour day. Also that certain typothetae offices will take work at a loss when they come into competition with an eight-hour office, and pro-rate the loss among themselves. MB. BONAPARTE CONFIRMED. I Nomination Was Overlooked by the Senate Yesterday.

MACHEN NOT ON STAND oovKRHmtirr reminded of PREVIOUS AGREEMENT. Gsorgs B. lonu, However, Testifies in Post Office Investigation?Other Witnesses Today. After a conference last tvenlnf, coudmI representing the government in the case of William O. Crawrford, on trial In Criminal Court No. 1 for conspiracy to defraud the United States In connection with a contract | for supplying the Poet Office Department with letter carriers* satchels and straps, de cided not to call August W. Machen as a witness. This decision. It is stated, was ?based on the fact that Machen claimed I that an agreement had been entered Into whereby he would not be called upon to I testify In any of the cases growing out of the Poet Office Department Irregularities, an?d that If placed on the stand he would ! decline to testify. I T,h? 5Pvernment, however, this afternoon called George E. Lorenz as a witness In its 'behalf. Loren*, with Machen, was brought to this city from the West Virginia penl tentiary at Moundsvllle, where both are serving sentences after conviction in the post office cases." The expectation was that the examination of Lorenz would be . concluded late this afternoon. In that event it Is likely that the two prisoners named will be taken to Moundsvllle without delay, starting fr?m here probably early this evening. Last of Government Witnesses. It is understood that Ijorenz was the last witness on the government's list to be call ed in the presentation of Its case in chief. Much time has been saved thus far in the second trial of Crawford, as compared with J the first trial. For instance, when the cause was originally on hearing Lorenz occupied tha witness stand for two days and a half. United States Attorney Baker concluded his interrogations of the witness at an early hour, and the prospects were bright that Lcrenz would be finally discharged as a wit ness prior to adjournment of the court to I day. Lorenz repeated substantially the state ments made by him during the first trial of Crawford. He told of having a conference with the defendant in April, 1002. at the Raleigh Hotel, this city, and of again visit ing here in June, 1002, coming at the sug gestion of Machen. Upon the occkslon of the June visit Lorenz said he conferred with Machen and Crawford, the result be ing the contract for supplying the Post Office Department with letter-carriers' satchels, by the terms of which Crawford was to receive one-fourth. Lorenz one fourth and Machen one-half of the profits. Further, Lorenz testified regarding the ?.i n/ ?f?U'e "bearer draft" to Crawford, 'detltln?d a copy Of a letter which he said he received from Crawford, containing memoranda showing Just how certain to h?3IiirMeiVed from the government was andbc?wfoerd.am0n* Wltnesse8' I plfasiMrh^CthIC>nf aPparentI>' desired to em ?.!? ? the testimony of Lorenz that a portion Machen was receiving comDanv fJ money paid Crawford's SSSX"" Po" Other Witnesses Heard.

Wash., December 7.?Raold Amundsen, the first man In history to travel the northwest passage from east to west, is still at Fort Egbert, Alaska, wait ing for an answer to the message he sent Monday night to Nansen In Christiania. His appeal for funds and assistance has borne fruit. Norwegians of this c'ty tele graphing him money. From the fact that Amundsen and h!s expedition are in winter quarters near the mouth of McKenzie river, his object, which he made public before leaving Christiania in May, 1908, has been fulfilled. OTAHA AT TOKIO. Grand Reception to Japanese Hero on He turn Home. TOKIO, December 7?11.30 a.m.?Field Marshal Oyama and his staff made a tri umphal entry into Tokio this morning. The enthusiasm and magnitude of Marshal Oyama's reception equaled that given Ad miral Togo. Despite the Inclement weath er, crowds of students and representatives of various classes and Interests thickly lined the streets, and, although exposed to the rain, lustily cheered the marshal and his staff while en route to the Imperial palace. The newspapers of all shades of option are highly eulogistic today on the achieve ments of Marquis Oyama, his generals and the men under his command. A holiday has been declared In the whole city in honor of the day. ANTI-PASS AGITATION. Western Railways Unlikely to Adopt Drastic Course. CHICAGO. 111.. December 7.?The anti pass agitation, which has started with the Pennsylvania road in the east, has not ex tended to the western roads. No road In the west is considering the advisability of cutting off all free transportation, and it if not likely that any will do so soon. The eastern experiment, however, will be watched with great interest here, and. If successful, it is possible that reform may be inaugurated by the western roads. It was stated generally yesterday that no such action could be successfully taken by one road In any competitive territory, and that such a move could be sucoessful only through concerted action. The pass attitude of western roads Is shown In the anti-paas agreement, which has been entered into among all western roads for 1906.

RUTLAND, Vt.. Dec ?mbrr 7.?W. J. B1 ck emdorfer of Stamford, Conn., and Miss Jesse Portion of Cincinnati, both of whom are particularly active In the efforts being m:de to save the life of Mrs. Mary M. Rog ers. arrived here today. Mrs. Rogers is un der sentence to be hanged at the Windsor state prison tomorrow for ths murder of her husband. The two ladies came here to consult with lawyers who have been a ding Mrs. Rogers. Mrs. Blickensdorfer said sfre had seen si>: of the jurymen who acted at the trial of Mrs. Rogers, and who, she said, gave her authority to state that they favored a com mutation of the woman's sentence. Miss I Portion bears a petition said to contain 30. 000 names of Ohloans requesting Gov. Bell to commute Mrs. Rogers' sentence to life Imprisonment. Both Mrs. Blickensdorfer and Miss Port Ion. after consultation with F. B. Fllnn and C. A. McCarthy, who have acted as coun sel for Mrs. Rogers, announced that they would proceed to Montpelier tomorr * morning and endeavor to intercept Gov. Bell to present their petition. Messrs. FHtin and McCarthy and F' M. Butler, another lawyer who has appeared In the case, were in conference here today making final arrangements to pee the gov ernor. Later one of the lawyers said It had been decided to go to Montpelier tomor row morning in an endeavor to meet Gov. Bell on his return from the west and there offer "Important considerations" bearing on the case. It is understood that these "considerations" are in the shape of evidence alleged to be new. Electrolysis. From the Brooklyn Kagle. Engineers who have been examining the skyscrapers In Pittsburg report that danger exists for them In the escape of electricity from the wires that cross that town in the air and under the earth. Three hundred copies of a report to this effect have been made, but all have disappeared, the city olhclnls having feared a panic in case the facts became known. Mr. Brownell. an ex pert, found that in several instances he could push a penknife through heavy iron pipes, and could scale the steel beams and uprights with a nail. Nearly all the plpea in the c;ty. he says, are In process of de struction through the leakage of electricity. This ought not to be ao serious a matter as it apunds, for modern construction U radically different in some of its essentials from that ot our ancestors, and while It Is understood that a t.i I building (^>uld have its stone casing shaken down by an earthquake and still stajid because of its metal frame. It Is reasonable to assume that Its metal frame miglrt crumble, and the structure would still hold together long enough at Urast to empty it of people and belongings, and then Its removal piecemeal, might be managed without accident. The danger of electricity Is possibly exag gerated. and If it could be kept in Its proper conduits it would be no danger at all; but careless workmanship, delays in re pairing and fnllure to protect the lower beams In an office building with non-con ducting material are responsible for ir.oro or less damage, oftener, however, from Are than from electrolysis. Our bridge, which becomes an object of popular alarm or.ee In a year or two, has been declared unsafe ?by reason of the escape of the electric cur rent. yet It apipenrs to stand It Setter than the Pittsburg buildings, and engineers re port no change In the beams and cables. The general introduction of electricity for work recently done by steam requires new precautions, however, and radical changes In the way of protecting skyscrapers may be necessary.
