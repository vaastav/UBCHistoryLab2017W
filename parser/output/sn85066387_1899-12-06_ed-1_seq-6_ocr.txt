UJ ITH the nnion of the various improvement / clul'S of the city in one association for the purpose of working more , effectively for progress a new and potent factor has been introduced into the campaicn fur municipal improvement now going on. The new organization is in itself an im provement upon past conditions and give? promise of achieving great results for the public good. In the mass meeting which followed the organiza tion of the Central Club the popular sentiment in favor of progress and improvement vras abundantly manifest. The speakers of the evening dealt in de tail with every issue that is to be voted upon at the coming elections, and upon each point had the sym pathies of the audience with them. It is to be noted, moreover, that the gathering was a thoroughly repre sentative one. and may be justly considered to have expressed the sentiment of the whole progressive ele ment of the community. As the force of the silurian opposition to the new movement is directed mainly against the proposals for extending and improving the park system, it was natural the speakers should leal moTe particu larly with that me. The arguments for it were clearly and strongly presented and were fully appre ciated by the assembly. The proposed new school buildings, sewers and hospitals arc of course needed, but they are not more requisite than the park exten sions, nor will they serve for the benefit of a larger number of the people. With the impulse given by this meeting to the movement toward popular education on the subject it is reasonable to expect' the campaign of education will go briskly on. The various improvement club* have already attested their value to the districts which they serve. They have accomplished many notable f accesses in the special lines of work they have un dertaken, and now that they are banded together for this greater work there can be no doubt their efforts will result in victory. The whole work, however, nm<t not be left to the association. Every citizen is concerned in the measures proposed, and each in pro portion to his energies and opportunities should aid in the campaign. It is to be. borne in mind that a two-thirds vote in favor of the improvements will be necessary to carry them.- Let all progressive citizens therefore join in the work and help to make success certain. School Director Kemp prefers evidently to be looked upon as a city chump ;vho let a golden oppor tunity go by through sheer ignorance rather than as a country gentleman who saw double eagles like sunbeams pass by him with not sense enough to catch a few. . trine to be carried out in the Philippine* at the ratio of sixteen to one judging from yevterd,-, dispatches, which state that Lieutenant Mm.ro captured the garrison of r,ght hundred men at B. ly ,, m bong with a force , | 1 Secretary Root, in his annual report, suggests the establishment of a war college that will raise the National Guard to greater efficiency.. He has pro ablj not met our Adjutant General Seamans or he would tremble at the prospect in California. The friends of Colonel Chadbourne know now why Governor Gage refused to let the doughty colonel keep his gold brick even as a memento. II: Ex cellency has resided the brick and Ins handed it to Frank Rs-an of Sacramento. " the death it reported in New )m»y of James I -aid to have been worth $40,000,000 In liis lifetime he never visited a theater or attended a ball game. Who would be a millionaire at such a sacrifice? The entire absence of reliable news from the Trans vaal is alarming the English They confess they are completely in the dark. How could they help being Qtbcrwisa— in Africa? ThjE MESSAGE. THE great length of the President's message niakfs its rcvie^- in one article impossible. The matters in it of fir«t interest relate to the - that have arisen in the Spanish war, and to the proposed financial legislation by Congress. The President takes the view, which The Call has con •y urged, that now is the time for such legisla tion He says the present situation is the most fit ting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance of the gold standard, that public confi dence may be promoted in the ability and purpose of the Government to meet all of its obligations in the mrney recognized by the civilized world as the best He admits that while, "happily, we are not at Dt compelled to resort to loans to suocly gold, it has been done in the past and may have to be done In the future, and it behooves us, therefore, to pro vide the Ikm means to meef the emergency when it . and the best meant are tho«e which are the • certain and economical Those now authorized j have neither the virtue of directness nor economy." He then recommends the measures proposed for financial reform, which have been so recently dis cussed in detail in these columns. Incident to his dis cussion of finance occurs a recommendation for ex tension pf the protective policy of the Government to the restoration of American shipping. The reasons Mich policy have accumulated during the past year, in which a less percentage of our commerce was carried in American bottoms than ever before. His first reference to the change produced by the Spanish war contains what may be an inadvertence, • or something intended to be interpreted by what fol- I lows further on. In discussing our representation at ! the Paris Exposition the message says: "I am in formed by our Commissioner General that we shall have in the American sections at Paris over 7000 ex hibitors, from every State in our country — a num ber ten times as sreat as at Vienna in 1573. six times U great as at Paris in 1878, and four times as many as at Paris in iß3q. This statement does not include exhibits from either Cuba, Porto Rico or Hawaii, for which arrangements have been' made." The inclusion of Cuba with the other annexed pos nd unexplained, will not tend to piacate the rising resentment of the masses in that inland. The next reference to Cuba i« to the effect that the withdrawal of Spain from thnt island left it held by the United Stitos in tru<t for the inhabitants, with such government provided by the executive. ing the execution of the pledge to leave the gov ernment and control of the island to its people, which >c sacredly kept." The President then refers to tile ties which bind Cuba to us as of singular intimacy and strength, and says that "whether I (hall be organic or conventional the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful form and manner irre vocably linked with our own. but how and how far is for the future to determine in the ripeness of events." After saying that we must see to it tint i* a reality and not a name, other qualifi cations follow to the effect that free Cuba must not be a "hasty experiment." a "loosely framed common wealth to face the vicissitudes which too often atten-1 states whose natural wealth and abundant resources ■•set. by the incongruities of their political organ ". ' N*o.vhere does the message use the terms r.ment or independence for Cuba, which are "the sacred pledge" of this Government, though there is a vague mention of a representative conven lh a general system of independent :i-l. after a long list of other things have been accomplished. While this part of the message is tentative, vague • .egative, .1 careful analysis discloses the weight of the Presidential indorsement thrown in the scale tor the retention of the is'and by the United States. The conditions precedent to a representative con vention are such as imply the adoption of the Fabian policy, of waiting until the Cuban aspiration for that independence which Congress declared was already and of right oug-ht to be theirs shall hay; lieen extinguished in discouragement and delay. The added recommendation that the products of Cuba shall have free acce-s to our markets, to the extent ■ ttteh products of other West Indian islands are admitted free by reciprocity, is in line with such analysis, and will cause certain foreboding among our agricultural and horticultural producers. The message puts our military force in the Philip pines at 2051 offrcrs nnd 63,483 men; in Cuba at JU4 • • men; in Pono Rico at 87 •rs and 2555 men; in Hawaii 12 officers and 453 men. a total army of 80.071 required in what are :':,er on referred to as '^ur island possessions." In reference to the Philippines an overlooked fact is recalled by the message. It says that the treaty ! of Paris provided "that the civil rights and political statue of the native inhabitants of the territory so ceded to the United States should be determined by the Congress of the United States." It will be seen •that under 'this provision Congress is competent to j give qualified and progressive independence to the j people of those islands; but the President proceed", to apparently conclude the polic* eJ>. this Government ir. a lons statement of events in the islands: the righteousness of the war of conquest is asserted, and the Pre-ident refrains from making any recommenda tion to Congress, and seems to indicate clearly that it shall reserve or abdicate its function of fixing the civil rights and political status of the natives, and leave that in his hands. The celebrated agreement •vith the Sultan of Sulu is handled gingerly. The. menage admit * that the Sultan acknowledges the -eignty of the United States, is pa id a salary of $760 a month, and that the treaty provides that any «lave in the Sulus shall have the right to purchase hit freedom "by paying his master the usual market value." The President ajrs: "I have ratified this agreement, subject to the action of Congress, an.l with the reservation, which I have directed shall be conveyed to the Sultan of Jolo. that this agreement is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give consent to the existence of slavery in the Sulu ar chipelago" As it does not abolish slavery, but per mit 1 - its existence, it is difficult to see that this reser vation amounts to anything. With some voluptuous references to the great wealth of the islands and our beneficent presence there the rafajttl is dismissed, in no more satisfac tory form than it was before. Congress is urged to I Something for tfawatt, if only to erect there a Federal judicial district, through which access may be had to the courts of the United States. Those who expected any recommendation of the extension of our constitutional system and its guar antees, the projection of republican government to what are frequently called "our new possessions," will be disappointed. HtheWeatures of the message, with an important bearing on domestic matters, will await further reference. If the remainder of the Boers are all like General Joobeti it is easy to see the finish of the British in South Africa. No less than four times in as many weeks the commander in chief of the burghers has been reported dead again. THE SAN 

FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1899. OUR INTERESTS fIT WASHINGTON* S^ ALIFORXIA'S interests at Washington will be l^ guarded by a delegation which on the whole is one of the strongest we have ever had at the national capital. We have not yet learned the value of electing the same Representatives term after term to as to have men of experience as well as of natural ability in the House, but we have improved upon the past, and in this Congress will have several members who have long been in the service and have acquireJ the friendship and the favor of delegates from other States upon whom they can rely for assistance in promoting California measures. In interviews published in The Call yesterday the Representatives from the State presented briefly some of the measures of local interest they hope to be able to carry successfully. Mr. Loud will endeavor to bring about the removal of Blo3som and Anita ' rocks, which are the only serious impediment to navigation in San Francisco harbor, and to procure lent appropriations for the early completion of the lonp-desired Federal building in this city; Mr. K.ihn will give a large part of his energies to the various questions of commerce which will arise dur | ing the session and will be among the most zealous in supporting a bill for the rehabilitation of our mer ! chant marine; Mr. Barham purposes to make a fight | for immediate action on the Nicaragua canal bill, and to that end will move to abolish the new commission that has been appointed to reinvestigate the subject, j it being his opinion as well as that of other earnest | acrocates of the canal that we have had commissions enough and it is now time to act; Mr. Waters' ef i forts will be directed toward hastening the completion j of the work at San Pedro harbor, and he will also j support the movement to provide a Federal system of irrigation for our arid lands; Mr. de Viries will carry on the fight of the mining men for the passage of what is known as the "California mineral lands bill," and will also favor legislation for the protec tion of forests; Mr. Needham will seek to obtain appropriations needed to complete the jetty at San Diego harbor and also a quarantine station— he is also largely interested in Indian education and in the irrigation of arid lands and will give much attention to those subjects;' Mr. Metcalf will be among the most active in upholding local interests during the s-csion, and among other measures of importance to the State will endeavor to obtain extensive appropria r improvements at Mare Island. It will be seen from these statements that our Con gressmen have not gone to Washington neglectful of the interests of the State. Each has some measure of local advantage to urge upon the House so far as it isible to do so. There are reasons for believing that the work of the delegation so far as these strictly Californian interests are at issue will be harmonious. No party questions are involved in them, and for their attainment the entire delegation should work together. c PROSPECTIVE IMPROVEMENT. EX GENERAL feeling of gratification followed the I V announcement of the sale of the entire Baldwin Hotel site to a capitalist who can be reasonably expected to erect thereon a building that will be an ornament to the city and worthy of the conspicuous position the site occupies on our main thoroughfare. Real estate transfer! of such nature as this are al ways more or less matters of public concern. When the Baldwin Hotel burned down there was left in the aspect of the city a gap that made the face of the town look as if it had a tooth knocked out. The fragments of the oH structure which were permitted to remain so long after the fire were eyesores and to some extent a menace. Then followed the prob ability that the lite would be piven over for years to cheap and comparatively worthless structures, and that one of the finest corners in the city would be sacrificed to petty trade and made something like a ■ii^i/race to the municipality. All such fear* are now happily over. In the pos session of Mr. Flood the Bfoperty will soon be put to right use. What manner of structure he will erect is of course for him to determine. The public is satisfied in the assurance that it will be a building which will add to the architectural magnificence of the city. The transfer of the property conies at a time when a spirit of improvement and enterprise is everywhere felt, and there are good reasons for hoping the new owner will endeavor to raUe upon it a structure that will stand as typical of the movement which marks the new era in our municipal develop ment. Representative Corliss of Michigan is about to re ne.v Ins effort to induce Congress to provide for th< construction o* a cable from San Francisco to Manila by way of Honolulu and Guam. He has a bill already prepared and will introduce it at once Now. if he will only attach one of those justly celc brated Corhss engines to the measure he may be able to rush it through. In view of the Sunday remarks of Rev C R Brown of Oakland denying the fall of man and' de eming Mo.es of the credit of the authorship of the Pentateuch, it is in order to move to change the title of his church from the First Congregational to the Second Unitarian. The ephemeral worth of fame and friendship has been strikingly demonstrated in a recent raid of the Boers A party of pnrsuing British soldiers dis covered that in a dismantled dwelling the Boers had used a picture of Gladstone for a door mat The Critical part of the war in the Philippines seems to have degenerated into ,- discussion between opposing generals over a telegraph wire. It is prob able that the Fihpmos consider that distance lends en chantment to the talk. A football player named Pulvermascher had his face stepped on recently in a New Jersey game and was Mrionsbr hurt. A man owning a name like that ought to be reasonably safe from danger in any kind of a mtx-up. Apparently the taste for Thanksgiving dinners has invaded the animal kingdom. A Mann County panther tried last Thursday afternoon to make a holi day meal of a Camp Taylor woodchopper. The next festal day for California will be that which opens at San Jose the celebration of the or ganization of the State government, and it promises to be a lively introduction for Christmas. Murderer Suisscr says he expects to drop through the gmllows into the infernal region. He seems to have a better conception of what he deserves- than his forircr conduct would indicate. The silver Republicans have decided to hold a na tional convention of 2000 delegates. They probably want to see how the whole party will look in one hall. Captured natives serenaded the American troops a few days ago in Manila. The tune was probably a Filipino version oi "Take Your Clothes and Go" MAKING READY FOR SANTA FE FREIGHT CARS How They Will Reach the City. The busy life of the water front will receive another marked boom when the Santa Fe freight traffic directly reaches San Francisco early next year. There will be a big: transformation in the ap pearance of the front in the neighborhood of Main-Btreet wharf, where the Santa Fc freight terminus has been located, and the life of a big freight depot will be strung daily by scores of trucks along south-of-Markct streets. The Santa Fe authorities and the Har bor Commissioners are driving the work of getting the wharves and docks as signed to the company ready for use, and for several days the work of clearing the depot block bounded by Bryant, Spear, Main and Harrison streets of building-*, ■grading for tracks and getting the. freight depot building Into shape has gone rapidly on. The Santa Fe freight cars are not to be brought from the bay terminus at Point Richmond to the city on big ferry-boats like the Thoroughfare and Transit of the Southern Pacific system. Instead, "car floats," or big barges with cartracks laid on them and hauled by strong tugboats will be used. Such car floats are used elsewhere, but will be new out here. Two floats and one tugboat will be ready for work when the line is ready. The floats will be long and narrow, with a length of 240 feet. Each will have three tracks, the outer ones with a capacity of six cars and the center one of five. The work of remodeling the wharf and building the Blip for the floats is well along. The tugboat will shove a float into a slip, where an apron 100 feet long will connect with the front end of the float and over which a yard engine will pass the cars. Two tracks will lead from the slip across Bryant street to the depot block. On this block the old rookeries and water-front grog shops have all disap peared. The only building left standing is a big two-story brick warehouse 137 by 275 feet in size on the corner of Harrison and Spear streets, and out of this the freight depot building is now being made. Big doors are being broken into the sides, where trucks will receive and deliver freight. Four tracks will run the length of the ground floor, with a narrow plat form along the center and a broad one along each side. It has been supposed along the front that the whole block would be roofed, but for the present no buidlngs will be erected and the rest of the space in the block, which is 275 by 560 feet in size, will be largely tilled with sidetracks along which team tracks will run and from which much unloading and loading of cars will be done. There will also be a derrick track, where heavy goods may be handled with a derrick. This Is the extent and style of the San ta Fe freight terminal now. The company also owns a fragment of the water front 'block on the corner of Harrison and Spear streets, but It will not be utilized until oc casion requires. The. Harbor Commis sioners do not expect that the company will ever utilize the China Basin conces sion. This one block looks small for a transcontinental freight terminus when compared with the Southern Pacific yard*, but whatever the Santa Fe people expect to do in the future about more room when It is needed they are keeping to them selves. The Santa Fe people now want to make Main street wharf their ocean steamship terminal as well. They have asked the Harbor Commission to roof the entire wharf., which Is 563 feet In length, and to give them Its exclusive use. The matter Is still under consideration, bat will prob ably be done. Th« company wants to run tracks from its depot grounds alone the length of this wharf, which would- bo bringing: ship and car together in an ex c«ptionnlly convenient way. This shows that the- Santa F*- expects to do a large . trans- Pacific business with Its steamers from this port. If it gets the Main street wharf its carloads of cotton can be quickly placed at a steamer's side and Its shiploads of tea and silk loaoV.l directly Into ear9,_jvhich will h* crossing the bay after a f?w minutes' switching. ■When the Santa Fe starts its freight business In the city according to the** plans two loner wharves and one dock and half of another, which • are now daily crowded with vessels, will he subtracts from the wator front facilities, already Inadequate to the general demand for room. 

SCOTT WORE A FALSE MUSTACHE THAT NIGHT PASSED COUNTERFEIT HALVES ON CONDUCTORS. Had Not Toiled. Neither Had He Spun, for the Past Two Years, and Has a Bad Brother. Frank Scott, accused of paxslng coun terfeit half-dollars upon conductors of the Sutter street cars, was held yesterday afternoon by United States Court Com missioner Heacock to answer before tae Federal Grand Jury. Scott was positively identified by three car conductors as the man who passed tne counterfeit half-dollars upon them on tne night of November IS. They identified him by his light clothes, a scar on his fare and a gold ring with a red setting that he wore. The only variation was tlie fact that the prlnoner was cl<*an-Pha\ »-il vrlien arrested, while he wore a light mus tache on the night of the 18th. His barber ajid a, man who keeps a cigar stand on the corner of Kearny and Pine streets testified yesterday that Scott had been clean-shaved for live months. Judge Heacoek was of the impression that tho prisoner wore a false mustache on the night In question. The fact tnat Scott had not worked for two years past ainl had no visible means of support and the further fact that his brother, Charles Scott, has been held to answer for pac ing :i gilded cent piece as a ten-dollar coin added weight to the false mustache the ory. BOAT-OWNERS PROTEST. Pumping Coal Tar in the Bay Injures Their Boats. A protest was yesterday sent to the Board of Supervisors by a number of lioatownerß having large interests in the North End, against the action of the Equitable Oas Company pumping coal tar Into the bay at the foot of Montgomery avenue. The protest states that the ad hesive qualities of the coal tar causes It to smear and spoil the appearance of l. .its whose owners have for mercantile purposes and otherwise been keeping their boats near the works of the i-mnpany Also that it has ruined the business of persons who have been maintaining surf swimming baths and prevents others from enjoying swimming In the vicinity The protest Is signed among others by br V P.

JANE STANFORD BACK FROM THE EAST CONFIRMS THE REPORTS OF THE BIG STOCK SALE. Pacific Improvement Deal May Not Be Consummated for a Year Yet. A Hitch in the Price. Mrs. Jane Stanford returned to the city yesterday morning, after an extended ab sence in Europe and the East. She re turns in excellent 'health, having been nruch benefited by the change of scene and climate that she has experienced during her trip. The sale of her interests in the Southern Pacific Company is now an old story, but there may be a new one soon about her holdings in the Pacific Improvement Com pany, concerning the sale of which Mrs. Stanford yesterday admitted there had been some talk, though nothing definite ha* yet been arranged Charles Lathrop and Russell H. Wilson, Mrs Stanford's direct-. rs In the Southern Pacific i '■■mpany, have both sent In their resignations. That of Mr. Lathrop has already been accepted and Mr. Wilson's will also be in the very near future Mrs. Stanford said yesterday that It may be a year before ehe and the Crockers sell out their interests in the Pacific Improvement Company. They are willing to sell now. but the point on which the negotiations hitch is the price to be received, and it may be some time before both parties to the deal succeed in arriving at a figure satisfactory to all concerned. Though Mrs. Stanford would say noth ing concerning the price that she and the « ro< ;5 ers demam! for their holdings In the Pacific Improvement Company, it is gen erally reported that the figure Is $8,000,000 apiece, or a total of $12. 000.

(The Call does not hold Itaeir responsible for the opinions published in this column, but pre sents them fur whatever value they may have as communications of general interest.) To the Editor of The Call: Tour re porter missed some of the spirit and letter of the remarks made by Rev. Ben jamin Fay Mills on the case of Brigham Roberts. Mr. Mills said that in its day polygamy was a great moral advance upon the pro miscuous association which must have preceded it. but that monogamy was a still greater moral advance on polygamy, since it placed the sanctity of the home upon a still higher foundation. Those who have, read Lecky's chapter on monogamy in his "History of Morals" will at once appreciate the full forco of the preacher's reference to the subject. JOHN P. IRISH.
