together by rapid moana ?tf communica? tion M to be hardly known to one another, and with historic traditioan extending over very few yean; now intercourse between the States ia swift and intimate; the ex? perience of centuries has been crowded into a few generations, and has created an intense, indestructible nationality. Then our jurisdiction did not reach beyond the inconvenient boundaries of the territory which had achieved independence; now, through cessions of lands, first colonized by Spain and France, the country has ac? quired a more complex character, and has for its natural limits the chain of lakes, tho Gulf of Mexico, and on the East and tho West, and two groat ocoans. Other nations were wasted DV civil wars for ages before they could establish for themselves the necessary degree of unity; tho latent conviction that our form of Government is the best ever known to tho world, has enabled us to emerge from civil war within four years, with a complete vindication of the constitutional authority of the General Government, and with our local liberties and State institutions unimpaired. Tho throngs of emigrants that crowd to our shores arc witnesses of the confidence of all peoples in our permanence. Here is the great land of free labor, where industry is blessed with unexampled rewards, and tho bread of tho workingman is sweetened by the consciousness that tho cause of tho country "is his own cause, his own safety, his own dignity," Here every ono enjoys the free uso of "his faculties and the choice of activity as a natural right. Here, under the combined influence of a fruitful soil, genial climes and happy institutions, popu? lation has increased iifteen-fold within a century. Herc, through thc easy develop rueut of boundless resources, wealth has increased with two-fold greater rapidity than numbors, so that wo have become secure against the financial vicissitudes of other countries, and, alike in business and in opinion, are scif-centred and truly inde? pendent. Here, more and more care is given to pr?vido education for every ono born on our soil. Here, religion, released from political connection with thc civil go? vernment, refuses to observe the craft of statesmen, and becomes, in its indepen? dence, tho spiritual life of the people. Herc, toleration is extended to every opi? nion, in the quiet certainty that truth needs only a fair field to secure the victory. Kere, the human mind goes forth un? shackled in the pursuit of science, to col? lect stores of knowledge and acquire an ever-increasing mastery over tho forces of nature. Here, the national domain is offered and beld in millions of separate freeholds, so that our fellow-citizens, be? yond the occupants of any other part of tho earth, constitute iu reality a people. Here exists the Democratic form of govern? ment; and that form of government, by the confession of European statements, "gi^i s a power of which no other form is capa" d i, because it incorporates every man with ?he State, and arouses everything that per? tains to tho soul. Whero, in past history, does a parallel exist to tho public happiness which is within the reach of tho peoplo of the United States? Where, in any part of the globe, can institutions be found so suited to their habits, or so entitled to their love, as their own freo Constitution? Every one of them, then, in whatever part of the land he has his home, must wish its perpetuity. Who of them will not now acknowledge* in the words of Washington, that "every stop by which tho people of thc United States have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of Providential agency." WhoJ will not join with me in the prayer that the invisible hand which has led us through the clouds that gloomed around our path, will so guido us onward to a perfect restoration of fra? ternal affection, that wo of this day may? be able to transmit our great inheritance of State Governments in all their rights, of the General Government in its Constitu? tional vigor, to our pesterity; and they to theirs through countless generations? ANDREW JOHNSON. WASHINGTON, December C, 1SG5. COLUMBIA. Saturday Morning, Dec. 9, 1865. The President's Message. Wo present to oar readers, this morn? ing, (twenty-four hours ahead of any other paper in the State,) the complete message of President Johnson, delivered before both branches of Congress on Tuesday last. This document has been looked for, and will be read with intenso interest by all classes, as it gives a pretty distinct in? dication of tho policy of the President. We shall reserve our comments on the message until our next publication. Cotton. The correspondent of a Northern paper says: "At the close of the war there were about 200,000 bales of cotton in Georgia, of which seventy-five per cent, belonged to private individuals and the residue to the Confederate Government and subjects of foreign powers. Of this number 50,000 bales were shipped North and to Europe direct, leaving 150,000 bales unsold and waiting transportation. The United States Treasury Agents have been nosing out that belonging to tho Confederacy, but with very indifferent success. The ac? counts and operations, financially, of tho Confederate Government, anterior to tho administration of Mr. Memminger, were upon snell a looso principle, that it was bard to tell whether it owned a great deal or nothing at all. And bereit may bo re? marked, that one of the primo causes which lcd to the downfall of Jeff. Davis' Government was the peculations of its quartermasters and other parties holding its fonds. As sn instance, there ir ss s msn acting as quartermaster, in a Sonth ern city, for four years. He was not worth the second shirt to his bank when appoint? ed, but when turned out bf office by Major General Wilson, XT. 8. A., he was worth half a million. And another is now one of your chief Wall street bulls, who made all his money hero in the same way. These cases might bc summed up and enume? rated indefinitely. They first caused the people to lose confidonco in the currency, which was the entering wedge that split up the whole concern." Local Items.

The officers oi tho Company deserve groat credit for the energy displayed, in the advancement of tho road towards com? pletion, as they have had to contend with disadvantages and drawbacks too nume? rous to mention. CITY IMPROVEMENTS.-A casual visit at the office of Messrs. Kay A Hewetson, yes? terday afternoon, afforded us an opportu? nity of inspecting the plans, etc., for tho temporary market to be erected in Assem? bly street, by tho city authorities. It wiii be a neat and tasty affair, and will afford tho architects an opportunity of display? ing their abilities. We bavo been informed by these gentlemen, and record the fact with pleasure, that they are preparing plans for over twenty buildings on Main street, principally first-class houses. The next spring and summer will see Columbia rising from her ashes, and we hope and believe that she will, in her new dress, present even a handsomer appearance than of old. So mote it be.
