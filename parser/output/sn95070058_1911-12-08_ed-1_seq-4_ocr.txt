Although the tobacco roorgnnlza- tlon will not probnbly rediico the price to the smoker , the law feels hotter now that Its majesty Is vindi cated. The government printing office hav ing published 21,11157,719 public docu ments the past year , Is probably the greatest supplier of old Junk In the country. It Is a misfortune to the men of this country that Dr. Wiley cannot get his pure tobacco law into operation Lef'-ro the Christmas cigars are put on the market. In view of the way .John D. collected his loans from the Morritt brothers , we have decided not to ask him for the loan of $7.75 with which to buy Christmas presents. Serious charges , were made against the army in the inspector general's report , but If they had succeeded In beating the navy at foot ball all would liuvo been overlooked. A Smithsonian Institute professor cays the world will continue its jour neys round the sun for 10,000,000 years. That ought to give time for a decision in the Lorimer case. Roosevelt Is charged with having made a deal with Wall street , but there will not be much complaint if ho worked off the two spots on them and gave them no high trumps. Seventy thousand women register ed for the city election In Los An geles. This seems to indicate that California women are anxious to make use of their right of suffrage. While wo disapprove of the Sunday colored supplement , we fear still more the demoralization of our children from the Congressional Record which is again turned loose in our homes. When the reporters are listening the congressmen will speak respectfully - fully of the tarif board , but for pur poses of practical politics they will place a higher value on the garden seeds. The Irish players were riotously re ceived In New York , but as the money kings have been so Improvident as to erect their skyscrapers in the kitchen garden , no vegetable offerings were made. J. I * . Morgan is now located in the thirty-first floor of the Hankers Trust Co. In New York. As ho has very little to do , he will bo glad to stop and gossip with any of our citizens who may visit the metropolis. Of course Hanker Morse had no par ticular reason to fear punishment when ho took the money. All the pun ishment usually inflicted on such an offender Is to elect him director of a few more corporations. It takes an eleven car train to ac- comodato the nine western governors who are touring the eastern states. They must bo taking almost as much baggage along as it takes for the college - lego girl to get by the winter term. There was at first much opposition to fortifying Panama , but It seems to bo agreed now that a $400.000.000 canal is too valuable property to leave lying around the back yard nights with all these disreputable characters prowling about. The report that President Tuft Is having a derby hat built Is one of many signs going to show that the "plug hat" Is gradually being rele gated to Indian doctors , circus sales men , and the more Infantile sprouts of the smart set. A great many good souls that are now advocating the referendum , the recall , nnd all the other so-called reform - form dope , were just as crazy about greenbacklstn , the grange movement , free silver , free trade nnd other Isms in the past , nnd If they did live for another quarter of a century , they are Hiiro to swallow every now thing ' In politics that would happen to ap pear In flight.

WHO 

FURNISHED THE MONEY ? The labor unions are doing the right thing In denouncing the MeNnmnrus. They ought to go further and demand that the parties who furnished the money to the MeNanmras , bo run to earth. Somebody furnished that mon ey the McNamaras didn't plan all that murderous conspiracy out of the love for human blood. Who furnished the money ? Senator Clapp of Minnesota calls President Taft a despot of the dark est eye. all because the president Haw- fit to refuse to glvo his sanction to the admission of Arizona as a state under a constitution which permitted the recall of judges. Some people have very queer Ideas of tyranny. Some people take themselves and their vlewr , so seriously as to be very funny. Senator Clapp is one of those people. That the school building of the fu ture Is to bo a social center for the community Instead of a building to which our children are sent five days In the week , but is never visited by the parents , Is certain. It is being agitated all over the country and now buildings are being constructed with this end In view nnd are supplied with audience rooms , platforms , and all that Is required for holding public entertainments , lectures and iniisl- calcs. The democrats In congress can have the advice of their favorite statesman in regard to the best way of managing the Alaskan problems. When lie was president , Thomas Jefferson - forson wrote to Albert Oallatin , his secretary of the treasury , under date of Nov. 8 , 1807 : "I am afraid we know too Mttle as yet of the lead mines to establish a permanent sys tem. I verily believe that of leasing will bo the best for the United States. " TO HE 

EXCITNG SESSION. The session of congress that opened Monday promises to be an interesting one. Presidential politics will cut a big figure , in view of the fact that next year Is presidential year. It will be a year of vicious attack and sharp retort. No legislation to amount to anything is looked for , be cause every faction will be looking for a chance to slaughter every other factor's prospects to claim credit from the public. Huncombe will be on tap , say those who know , and the regular republicans , the insurgents and the democrats will all jockey for position. Mr. Brandeis , who has made sev eral important suggestions concerning the better management of railroads , makes a further Interesting contribu tion in the "Engineering Magazine" for the present month , to the effect that efficiency and unit standards could bo better maintained if the government should establish a bureau for railroad along the same line as the agricultural department , the de partment of commerce and labor , and other government bureaus. The time has come when the government has properly a great function in indus trial business. The functions of the government In these departments Is not only to prohibit nnd regulate , but much more the constructive field of ascertainment , experiment , and edu cation. Iowa has a Woman's club that has chosen a most fitting and commend able object for which to labor. It is nothing less than a study of physical perfection nnd how to obtain it for the rising generation of lowans. A campaign is on looking toward the in struction of every mother In the state in the needs and possibilities of child welfare. Theory is not enough ; from now on , every Infant In Iowa will be the subject of practice , and the stan dard Is perfection. A woman physi cian who is a member of the club , has been sent to Europe to study stan dards and methods In nil European countries for a year at the club's ex pense , and the matter is being man aged in a most practical way. It is a splendid undertaking nnd the most far-reaching and Important that any club of women has yet undertaken. Beside it the fight for the ballot sinks into insignificance. All success to the women of Iowa ! 

FINDING PRESENTS FOR MEN. No , Genevleve , don't buy your best fellow that dinky little blotter holder that has to be rolled back and forth with a sea sick motion. Remember that George gets from his insurance agent flat strips of blotting paper that are twlco as handy on his desk. Nor don't offer him bunches of shaving paper with a lot of frills and flufflness that will merely catch dust. George probably uses a safety razor and cleans it at the hot water faucet. If you want to glvo him something ho will really like , study the kind of neckwear he affects , and go down to the swellest men's furnishing goods store you can find , and buy him a tie as near In color tone and pattern n you can to those he IH already wear- Ing. Man Is it conservative critter In his personal habits. If he likes Inconspic uous patterns In his negligee shirts , don't pick him stripes an noisy as a barber's pole , that will glvo him a grouch every time he puts It on for duty's sake. THE PAVING MOVEMENT. Every Norfolk patriot will rejojlce over the completion of the petition calling for the paving of Norfolk av enue from Seventh Htreet west to Fourteenth , and of Ninth street from Norfolk avenue north to Prospect ave nue. It Is an Improvement that In badly needed and Its achievement will mean another big step for Norfolk toward the goal that It Is aiming at. The city will look to the mayor and council for speedy action In push ing thu matter along , as they have al ready given assurance of their hearty sympathy with this progressive move ment. ment.With With the completion of this pro jected paving , there still will remain one section of town that ought to get Into the paving bandwagon. There will still bo need of a paved street to the now depot at South Norfolk and with that accomplished , together with that which Is proposed by the petition that has just been submitted , Nor folk will become an altogether differ ent city than It ever has been. Americans are likely to DO more or less suspicious and ready to take of fense when foreigners of note , espe cially Englishmen , tell us what they think of lib , analyze our motives nnd criticise are Institutions , but when AmbnssadoHryce consents to toll the people of thu changes ho sees and the progress be notes since he first visited America forty years ago , wo are all ready to listen to his words of commendation or warning. Forty years ago Mr. Htycc saw grave dan ger for this republic In the strife be tween the north and the south which was most bitter at that time , now be sees that bitterness scarcely more than a memory. Forty years ago there could bo nothing much worse and apparently more hopeless than the government of American cities. Now be finds it wonderfully Improved and progressing most hopefully to ward a higher standard. Our civil service reform and our currency strengthening were liberally compli mented end the great English pin- bassndor expressed the belief that having lived down the other great evils that had threatened the life of the republic in the past , we should prove equal to solving the new and equally grave problems that confront the nation today. His words should give us courage to attack the prob lems of our day as bravely as our fa thers did those of forty years ago. THE McNAMARA CONFESSION. The confessions of the McNamaras in the Los Angeles Times dynamiting case , one pleading guilty to murder and the other to blowing up the Llewellyn Iron works , brings to a close one of the most sensational crimes of history and will glvo gen eral satisfaction to the public in the thought that the guilty have been found out. Twenty-one employes of the Los Angeles Times were blown into eter nity by dynamite. The Times had for years been fighting union labor. The Times at once declared that the crime was a union labor conspiracy nnd labor leaders the country over argued there was no foundation for such statement. Some months after the crime , the two McNamaras were ar rested on Information that had been secured by Detective Burns. They were arrested In Indianapolis and hur ried across the country to Los An geles. Labor leaders denounced this as illegal kidnaping. An Immense fund was raised for the defense. Clar ence Darrow , who had acted ns coun sel for the defense in the Idaho gov ernor assassination case , took charge of the McNamnra defense. The mat ter of securing a jury was a difficult one. The trial had been in progress two months and only eight jurors had ( been secured. Then came arrests on the charge of bribing prospective jur ors , and later a rumor that some of the sworn jurors had been tampered with. Friday sensational rumors flow thick and fast. Then , In the evening , came the confessions , like a thunder bolt out of a clear sky. Nobody ex pected them at least , the general public outside of Los Angeles had not anticipated them. The crime of the McNnmaras cnn not bo laid at the door of labor as a wholo. Laboring men , ns a class , like most other men , would denounce such methods ns damnably detestable and would stand staunchly for enforce ment of the law. That the crime of the McNnmaras In trying to coerce the Los Angolcs Times to accept terms of union labor was a dastardly one , no man or element neither capi talist nor laborer would attempt to deny. NEW AMERICAN CARDINALS. The creation by Pope Plus X. of three more American cardinals Is nn event that means a great deal to Ro man Catholic Americans. Previously there has been but ono American car dinal , .lames Gibbons of Baltimore. One reason why the college of car dinals has remained HO largely Italian was that In the early days It was so difficult to communicate with the members of the college from foreign parts. History records one cane whore a pope appointed a man who had been dead some little time , the news not having reached Home. And ono English cardinal never learned of his appointment , so many believe , al though his death took place ten months after the event. The English court kept the news for him , and In those days of slow communication It never reached him in any other man ner. Many American Catholics bellovo that the Italian churchmen have been so absorbed In the artistic and ma terial development of the city of Rome , ( hat they have given far too little thought to the Interest of the church at large. ! t is the belief of American Cath olics that the American church shows a devoutness and loyalty that entitles It to larger influence. On the other hand , It Is remarked that the unsatis factory results of Italian churchmanship - ship are shown by the failure of that church to plant a deeper feeling of loyalty in the hearts of the Immi grants who come here from that coun try. try.A A Jesuit father , writing In the Church Extension Magazine , Illus trates this point by telling of bis ex periences in canvassing among a gang of Plcdmonteso Italians In an Ameri can mining camp , to secure funds for a Catholic chapel. None of them would glvo a cent , and finally they pelted the priest with coal. On apply ing to some Japanese miners , each of thp latter gave him $1. On the basis of population , It Is pointed out that the United States would be entitled to six cardinals. In the old days it might take a year to get a quorum of the college at Rome. Hut now Rome can reach Cardinal Gibbons at Baltimore in thirty min utes any day , and in ten days ho could be walking up the steps of the Vatican. The situation , says a writer in the North American Review , was as if all our cabinet members and senators were chosen from New England , leav ing the rest of the country to bo sat isfied with postmasters and Internal revenue collectors. That Pope Plus was influenced by these arguments Is apparent , and the four Americans will play a large part at Rome. BOILING IT DOWN. President Taft's message contains this time but about 6,000 words. For every one person that read his former 15,000-word production , there will be a hundred who will scan this effort closely. It was R. L. Stevenson , we believe , who once remarked upon the divine gift of leaving things out. There is a poem , dear to the heart of every newspaper man , that advises the would-be contributor to leave out ev ery superfluous word and comma , af ter having skeletonized it to the very limit , to send it on to the editor , who then will begin to boil it down. People who never had literary or newspaper training have no concep tion of the Increase in effectiveness that comes through cutting out super fluous words and phrases. Every needless sentence Is so much dead wood that fatigues the mind , and weakens the structure as a means of persuasion. A magazine editor once showed us the manuscript submitted by a talent ed writer. The magazine people , to save valuable space. had gone through it and cut out about one- fourth of the words without affecting the force of the statement In the least degree. In the ordinary letter to the press produced by the untrained writer , about one-half of the words are abso lutely needless , being merely repeti tions of ideas expressed before. President Taft seems to have gain ed some apprehension of this fact. Perhaps he has come to realize that the president's annual message to con gress Is his best opportunity to gain the public ear. He has just traveled some 15,000 miles to talk to 5,000,000 people. And yet through the news papers he can by a tersely worded message get twlco as many hearers without stirring out of the white house. In the old days It used to be cus tomary for all the newspapers to print the president's message In full. Fifty years ago a newspaper would sweep local news nnd sensational doings out of Its pages to give space to the one great public document that people were supposed to peruse carefully. For the last few years there has scarcely been a newspaper In the country that has been willing to give a verbatim report , on account of the growing length of the messages.
