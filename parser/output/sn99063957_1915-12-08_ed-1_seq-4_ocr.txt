THE HOMER DAVENPORT MONUMENT It is with considerable gratification that old time Ore gonians remember that Homer Davenport living, erected with his elnmifint nencil a monument to himself that re quires nothing from us to add to its enduring beauty. It is self-satisfying to know that he was an Oregon boy who went out into the world and won laurels of which we are all proud, and added to the glory of our great state. We point with pride to his achievements and take every occasion to ao mm nonor, proviueu we tuimeci, uumcivco up with it. We held him in so high esteem that a society was formed for the purpose of erecting a monument to his memory at his boyhood's home, the pretty little city of Silverton. The society very properly selected the governor of the state as the custodian of the funds to be collected. As a nucleus for the fund, which it was pro posed to raise by small subscriptions, about $57 was sub scribed. There the matter dropped and not a cent has been added to the fund since. It is a shame and a disgrace to the state and especial ly to the'Willamette valley that this is so, and the quicker we take steps to remedy this, the better for our repu tation. This fund of $57 is now on deposit at the Ladd & Bush bank in this city, and we suggest that someone take the matter in hand and see if the money cannot be raised to complete the monument. It would be asking too much to put the matter into the hands of the bank to receive sub scriptions, for banks are busy places, but the bank will take care of the money, and do anything else to assist. We do not know who was on the committee, or if there is a member here, but if there is, we suggest that he get busy and start the ball rolling. It is not because Oregon people are stingy or unfeeling that this matter has been neglected, but because they are careless and no oppor tunity is given them to contribute their mite. It should be an easy matter to secure the fund with subscriptions of fifty cents, and indeed that is the way the fund should be raised, so that we may all have the pleasure of aiding in honoring one of the state's brightest sons. THE REWARDS OF PEACE . Gains to the United States because of the European war continue to come tremendously, without our plan ning and almost without our effort. The greatest profit is in the growing balance of trade, which is by far the largest in the history of the country. During the year ending October Pl our foreign trade ex ceeded five billions, and the exports were more than twice the value of the imports, leaving a balance of $1,626,886, C2:,5 in our favor. During the year $:.26,528,779 in gold came to this country to pay the debts of other peoples to ours. New Vork is taking the place of London as the financial Clear ing house of the world, and the gold dollar the place of the pound sterling as the world standard of exchange. American dyes are now being produced at the rate of 9000 tons annually and are taking the place of German dyes. Certain high grades of steel, formerly made only at the Krupp works, are now being produced in even better quality here. There are many other gains of great importance. The certainty is that the war, even if it should end tomorrow, has given to tho United States a sure position of world leadership. "Walla Walla" in the Oregonian asks: "In states where capital punishment is in effect, please advise if it applies to women as well as men." The Oregonian answers yes, and most certainly is mistaken. The law so applies, but the punishment does not, which is a dis tinction with a vast difference. The difference between Henry Ford, the king of Innnin .. .1.., . A ....1 - C ll.. .T. I'lucum- turn iuu iuuks ami run-is 01 um waning nations is that Henry made his will before he started on his job and they made their wonts. One redeeming feature about President Wilson's messages is the fact that they are correctly phrased and that only good English is used to express his thoughts. But at best the modern presidential message is a dreary, affair, dealing with yards of statistics and reiterating the political views, with arguments to sustain them, which every newspaper reader already knows the author is committed to. Jefferson and Lincoln, the nation's greatest presidents wrote very brief messages dealing with the paramount policies of the time, leaving statistical in formation to be gathered and submitted to congress and the country through the heads of departments. President Roosevelt's messages averaged longest of any of the occupants of the White House, Taft was verbose and Wilson seems to be acquiring thehabit of his immediate predecessor. His message o fyesterday might have been a model for future presidents to copy had it been con densed into two columns of average newspaper length. Then it would have been more generally read and understood. It might be inferred from the returns that the people of Salem did not want the charter amended as proposed, but the truth of the matter is that they did no care a cent ab&ut it. Out of 5200 voters in the city 1246 cared enough about it to go to the polls, and nearly four thousand cared so little they did not go to the trouble of voting. As a matter of fact there was not that many interested in the charter; for in two precincts, the fifth and seventh, where there were councilmen to elect the vote was m each above "00, or more than double that of any other precinct ex-J tcpu uic oialii. li it tu.e lu suy mm less man vw went 10 the polls on account of their interest in the charter amend' ment. The president told in his message what he thought of hyphenated Americans, who were blowing up munition factories and violating the laws of this country. It would make interesting reading if he would now tell us what he thought of the unhyphenated Englishmen who are swiping American ships and violating the international laws. - Some of those English crews could be punished for piracy without stretching the laws very much. As the republicans are generally in favor of "prepared ness" or at least their leaders are, and as President Wilson is also inclined that way; and as there seems to be about half the citizens of the country against the movement, it looks as though there would be a chance for a new party. This would make a splendid opportunity for Teddy, only he would have to do such a back-summersault that he might not be able to make the race after it. Marion county officials are peculiar in one respect at least; they are carrying over into the coming year an un expended balance of $60,000 in the treasury. A majority of public officials see to it that all money raised by tax ation is expended and then issue as many warrants against the next year's increase as they can without draw ing too much criticism.
