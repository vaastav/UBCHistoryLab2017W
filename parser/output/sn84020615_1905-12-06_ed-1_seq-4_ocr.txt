V i WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER (, 1905. PAGE FOUR. AJLHUQUEKQUK EVENING CITIZEN. THE ALBUQUERQUE CITIZEN Published Dally and Weekly By The Citizen Publishing Company W. S. 3TRICKLER President W. T. McCREIGHT Business Manager JOINT STATEHOOD The president on joint statehood found a lillle stick fully as effectual as the big stick with which ho brained ' the lawless corporations; and, Incidentally ,tt will soon be quite amusing to see the speed with which the antls will tumble over themselves In trvlnir to cet into tho liand ; -wagon. Rats always forsake a sinking ship. , The president's utterance on statehood for the terri tories was a model Illustration of that anciently lauded virtue of "much la little." Clear, concise, incisive, un , Answerable, It disposes of the statehood question by pre : venting it in an absolutely new light, which Is not only ' recognised as Irrefutable at the first glance but which causing everyone Interested In the question to ask hltn ; self Why hadn't I thought of that before? The president's position Is that territorial entitles ' have been created out of the public domain for conven i ionce of administration, and that such creation confers ; upon the territories no rights whether of continued ex ! istence, intactness of boundaries, preservation of names, (. or silly sentinientalism of any kind which the nation I most observe when It undertakes to form a new state, i The territories, when segregated from the general Jo- main, never ceased to be national property; and when In j the wisdom of the national government the general good r tho American nomila la In ho advanced hv conferring upon certain territories or parts of territories or aggre gation of territories, the blessings of statehood, the sole question to be asked Is not what certain sentimental grannies and chronic office holders and grasping cor- ' of the owners of these territories, who are the Ameri can people at large T In the light of this aspect of the question, which tue preseldent makes as clear as a sunbeam, the. utterances of Mark Smith, of Arizona, and James Graham Mc Nary, proprietor of thd Las Vegas Optic, together, look about like fifteen cents. "Common decency to the peo ple of Arizona." as Mr. Smith puts it, has been so flat tened out that It Is safe to say it will never again be made to do duty, even in the continued absence of all Argument. Mr. McNary, who by the way, comes out ' for the first time In favor of no statehood, though the -utterances of the Optic have all been In favor of single statehood only as a preference Mr. McNary says, "we do not want this thing, and the more Beverldge and his colleagues say we must take It, the more our American ism exclaims that we will not take it." Thanks are due to Mr. McNary for two facts, not before known. They are tnat he has been in tne territory ftrty years, and that the president Is a colleague of Senator Beverldge. 

NEGRO IN WOODPILE The Morning Journal is certainly one of the most remarkable Instances of facility In eating crow," "to foe found in the public press of this day and country. But yesterday almost proved too much for even its capacity. Having published a telegram, .yesterday morning, which was a lie from beginning to end, and the falsity of it having been exposed in The Citizen last evening, the Journal of course had to take it all back this morning. However, it was a bitter pill and In the effort to make it more palatable, the retracted falsehood was covered over with a fake "special" concocted as usual in the Journal's own office. , However, in this instance the Journal was us much sinned against as it was a sinner. In fact Its main fault in connection with this particular case was its proverbial anxiety to injure any and every enterprise of this city or territory, regardless of the general value of such en terprise, if only there be connected with It some person or persons against whom the Journal has arbitrarily assumed a grudge. This well known peculiarity of the morning paper is much to be regretted. But in the present case the Journal did receive tha telegram published. . It was not, like so many telegrams published by it, made In its own office; and thereby hangs a tale. This fake, because absolutely false, tele gram came to Denver and was published by the Iiepubr lican and the News of that city, each as a special to its own paper. At Denver this double special was slightly altered in words but not in statements, and from ther ent out as an Associated Pretts telegram to the Albu querque Journal and the El Paso Times. The recent Investigation of the Insurance companies In New York has shown that those companies yearly expend large sums In salaries to uewspaper men, the supreme duty of whom Is to procure publication in tel egraph form of absolutely false mutter. Now it is evlr dent that the telegrams sent out from Pennsylvania about the Pennsylvania Development company, and which the Journal has so eagerly published, are of this Identical character. It is also evident that the purpose of these telegrams is to damage the Development company, lower the credit of the Santa Fe Ceutral, and defeat the build ing of the Albuquerque Eastern. The Citizen is glad to learn that the officials of the Development company are determined to unearth the origin of those telegrams and expose the parties who are endeavoring to Injure their property; and The Cltlzeen hereby expresses the earnest desire, in which it will be Joind by many In New Mexico, that the Journal shall hereafter more carefully consider the subject matter or its news, and cease lending itself as a willing instru ment to all who may desire to injure territorial and city enterprises. 

FEWER ACRES "Fewer acres and better farming," Is what F. D. Coburn, secretary of the Mate board of agriculture of Kansas, says should be the farmers' Ideal now. Mr. Coburn loathes a fad and when he retires from service it can never be said tjiut Kansas has lost time in agri cultural progress through the chasing of chimerical little birds that fly after success In agriculture by any royal road except that of intelligent work. Thorough tillagtj of the soil, and good seed Is the ground work upon which Mr. Coburn bases his Btaudard and certainly Kansas beats the world for doing things when she om-e g-ts on the right track. "I came to this state f a time when it was con sidered foolhardy for anyone to attempt to farm profit ably. There was no agricultural future after you crossed me Missouri, in the general opinion of the world of that time. We began to farm Just the same and each time that a man located bis farm west of yours lie was con sidered a little more daring and adventurous than the fellow just before him. This going on and on, pushing beyond the supposed agricultural belt by the newcomers widened the' arable districts gradually until now the Kaunas farmer has pushed the unprofitable lands off of the map and we have a state made up of one vast rich agricultural tract and valuable herds of cattle pasture on lands once relegated to the buffalo." The number of telegrams, led by Hi two dally papers, sent to President Uoo.sevelt lust night, wus very large, running up into dozens. They certainly will leave no doubt upon the mind of the chief executive as to the sentiment of New Mexico's metropolis In its approval of bis policy concerning statehood. I.et the anils r.mr and imagine a vain thing. Joint statehood has behind it Hie Heutinient of the nation, of congress and of l be national administration The Cnited Slates Geological Suney ..ays lh.it ihe geologic conditions in New Mexico are less known than hi uny other region of e.pial size In the 1'nited Slates. This U another argument for statehood. Then we could take our place at the family board and enjoy our share of tho goo.) things, Instead of getting only step-father blessings. yxxxocoxxxx)oox)xxox)ooooc Symposium on Joint Statelhood Question cxoooxxxxxcxxcoxxxkxxxxxx 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma admitted a on state, and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted on state. There is no obligation upon ua to treat territorial aubdivisidns, which are a matter of convenience only, as binding on the question of admis sion to statehood. Nothing hat taken up more time in the congress duhing the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four territories above men tioned, and, after consideration of all that has been de veloped in the discussion of the question, I recommend that they be Immediately admitted as two states. There is no Justification for further delay; and the advisability of making the four territories into two states has been clearly established. In some of the territories the legislative assemblies Issue licenses for gambling. The congress should by law forbid this practice, the harmful results of which are obvious at 'a glance. President Roosevelt. Kean St. Chas. of Kingman. Col. J. F. Wilson refuses to accept Editor Bird's challenge to publicly debate the joint statehood question. This Is the first time from til to 1905 that the colonel has sounded, the retreat. It Is not possible the colonel Is running out of air, so he must consider ho Is over matched by Colonel Bird. It Is hard to believe In Col onel Wilson's case that the Osier theory loves a shlulng mark. Tenderly lay the Colonel away; Ily the mineral hills of Yavapai. He has been some pumpkins In his day, But growing years will have their say. ' Our Mineral Wealtn. m New Mexico's Next Governor. "I am in favor of Joint statehood for New Mexico and Arizona, if It can be secured on terms which are fair and it seems to me that the. time has come when the long-agitated sfatehood question should be settled. 11 Its agitation for so many years has done New Mexico great harm by creatolng an unsettled state of feeling, prejudicial alike to our political and material interests, to have the question properly settled, once for all, would do vast and far-reaching good. The people would know what their permanent political future Is, uud they would resolutely set themselves to work to adjust themselves to II." H. J. Hagerman. An Arizonan Speaks. Keep at congress for Jointure, said T. 1). Casanega, of Calabasas, to The Oasis editor. You are right. The people of Arizona and New Mexiao need self-government with a railway commission which will regulate frieghts and fares, and a board of equalization which will regulate taxation so the railways and big producing mines will bear a fair share of the burdens of government. The only way to secure the reforms needed Will be by having a state government elected by the people and responsible to the people. Put me down for statehood; any old kind, and the quicker the better. Senate and House. !" Washington, Dec. 6. Chlarman Beverldge, of the senate Committee on territories, was in conference with republican party leaders last night, among thorn Speaker Cannon. Statehood was discussed and it was announced after tho meeting that there would bo an omnibus bill passed this session, or no bill at all. This la the bill admitting Oklahoma and Indian 'Territory as one state, and New Mexico and Arizona as another. It Is con ceded at all hands that such a bill will become a law at this session. Telegram. 8ome Best Citizens, i The Tucson Joint statehood advocates bold a meet ing yesterday and wired their views to tho president. The Enterprise always holds that every man has tho right to hold and express his opinions, Vind while some of Arizona's best citizens are found In the joint statehood ranks, yet we cunnot but think that they are mistaken, and laboring to secure something that would be very disastrous to Arizona's interests should they succeed. Phoenix Enterprise. United States Attorney. "You may say for me," said Major W. H. H. Llewel lyn, when leaving for the north today, "that while 1 have been a long and consistent advocate of separate state-' hood, and still believe in justice New Mexico Rhould lie come a separate state, that with the president and the new governor against us, I believe joint statehood Is the only k.lnd possible, and I believe we should accept that form rather than remain longer a territory." Optic. Picking Out Positions. Former Governor L. C. Hughes is the logical leader of the few joint statehood advocates lu the territory, and If the bill eventually passes, he will bo the logical candidate of the Arizona forces for governor of the new state. Allen T. Bird, of Nogales, and B. S. Rodey, of New Mexico, wlU be the logical candidates for the United States 'senate. Tucson Post. Territorial Jointure Meeting. Absence of The Oasis editor from the Joint statehood meeting at Tucson Monday of last week seems to worry the. Douglas Dispatch greatly. Mr. Bird was not needed there at that time. That's all there Is to that. When the territorial jointure meeting is In session, a couple of weeks hence, he will be there. Nogales Oasis. Municipal Action. The city councils of Albuquerque and Santa Fe and the Farmington board of trade have passed resolutions iu favor of Joint statehood and copies were sent to the president, the presiding officers of both houses of con gress and the chairman of the committee on territories in each house. 00000000000XX00 Doctor's Humorous Reply to Patient tXKOOOCKXKXXX)XX0XXXXXXX)00 A prominent Boston physician tels of the many ridic ulous requests that were received by Investigators iu connection with tho Kountgen rays when the experiments were lirst taken up in that city. Hundreds of applica tions were received from various parts of New England from Individuals who had or Imagined they had, bullets and sundry other foreign substances in the different portions of their anatomies. one investigator received a most remarkable request from a man living in Haver hill, Mass. His communication was couched iu some thing like the following form: "1 have had a bullet In my thorax for nigh outo ten years, and. as I am too busily engaged all day to come to Boston, I trust that you will find It convenient to come here and locate the bullet. am positive the case would Well repay your coining. But if you can not come yourself, then send your apparatus and I'll get one of our locu) doctors to use it." The medical man to whom this letter was addressed being of a humorous turn, his reply was as follows: "To my regret I shall bo unable to visit you; nor can 1 send you the apparatus. But, n the event that you should 11 ml It absolutely Impossible to visit Boston, if you will send me your thorax, I assure you that I will do the best I can for you." Success Magazine,
