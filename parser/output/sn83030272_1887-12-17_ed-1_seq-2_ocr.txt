F Townsend Twelfth Infantry and Major R Loder Third Artlllorr speak in the hlghes forms of the subsistence nuartorra tor and medical departments of time oncnmpmonL CoU Townsend says of the Seventh Regiment that tholr arms appeared to bo In excellent Border and serviceable but ho declares that the glazed knapsacks woro poor affairs and of but little use Continuing ho days 0 Generally dIscipline In this regiment was good military courtesy was scrupulously ob served anti nil orders were obeyed promptly nail with apparent wllllnBiioss After the first two days a marked improvement was manifest particularly in the ceremonies Guard mount ing and dross parades became nearly perfect The Adjutant however habitually posted him self much too far to front at guard mounting in fact nearly at the point he would take for dross parade In drills numerous errors oc curred from time to time but they wore care fully corrected by the instructor and a decided improvement was shown toward tho last Guard duty in some respects was well done in others less so There was too much conversa tion between continuous sentries and posts wore not walked with that spirit and alertness that Is desirable The formation of line of bat tIe at parades was toohnrritd Tho companies moved out from their company streets nearly or quite simultaneously and appeared upon lino nearly at the statue moment Several in con fluence wore obliged to mark tlmo until op portunlty occurred to move to place A little more tIme taken would have avoided this and the appearance would have been considerably Improved The marching in battalion drill mid parades was excellent Time manoeuvres were fairly well done the skirmish drill not HO poll done but considerable Improvement in both drills was exhibited toward the last The manual of arms at guard mounting and dress parado toward the latter part ol the week was us near perfection as soldiers are likely to not antI quite ns good as IH desirable but at com pany and battalion drills the same attention was by no means paid to this point The police of camp ground won simply perfect I havo never before seen M > clean n camp Take it all In all this regiment deserves croat praise and well BUKtnlned Its lino reputation Of the Twelfth HoBlmont Col Townsend fiiys that time number of raw men Is very large lie complains that time uniform coat is too heavy but OH iu the case of the Seventh he compliments the condition of the arms Con tinning lie said I should describe this raiment as being thoroughly amenable to discipline and that any apparent lack of It was duo to ignorance rather than Intent Jlilltnrycourtesy was very largely observed yet there were many In stancos In which It was lacking 1 noticed however that such matters were always cor rected when observed by officers and in n few days it becamn exceptional to note lapse In this respect The men were willing to learn and obedient in executing orders At night after taps the camp was uniformly quiet The Instruction of the regiment cannot be said to be very good though it Is rapidly Improving It has most capable field officers and an excel lout Adjutant who are doing efficient work but many of tho line officers are not yet up to mark Drills company battalion and skin mishwere constantly kept up each drill show ing good advance over the preceding one Major Loder made the report upon the For tymonth Fifth Nineteenth and Twentieth Separate Companies constituting the Kocond Provisional Battalion lie says that the cloth Ing and cauipments were in excellent condi tion lie compliments the instructor and sajs Tile men manifested much spirit in their drills and nlthouch battalion drills were hard hot and long continued I found no disposition to grumble every one doing his share willing ly The errors became loss from day to day and with one exception tho commands made rapid improvement The last drills were near ly perfect technically and generally the last parade and guard mount were quite so I dad It mated by others that military courtesy was as a rule strictly observed and I found It so The men were respectful and obedient No non sense intoxication noise or luxuries were found in camp and after tans even on last night the gteiitest quiet prevailed The oflicers and men were required to wear their uniform at all times ana when outside tent or company streets coats had to be but toned and this was general from the com mandant down Guard duty was well per formed grand rounds every night In my tours 1 found men and officers well pooled All they required was a little moro experience The police of the camp was nearly oorfect On one occasion I consIdered it us poriuct in the body of the canip Fiiis careful policing extended throughout the
