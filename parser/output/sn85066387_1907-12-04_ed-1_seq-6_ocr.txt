It will be difficult for the Examiner to make its nasty charges stick against" this judge. No citizen with a spoonful of brains will believe that the court was influenced, as Hearst declares, by the Southern Pacific and the United Railroads, to decide in their favor, for it is plain, even to the lay mind, tthatt t the challenged appropriation was both illegal and \u25a0 foolish. £ San Francisco has too much need for every one of her dollars to put 720.000 or any number of them into the experiment of making a municipal railroa<fout of the ramshackle Geary street line. The supervisors who made up the last budget were fully aware that they could not call this experiment an' emergency such as would justify a special tax above the dollar limit, so they put the appropriation for it as an "ordinary expense"' among the regular items^of the budget inside the charter limitation of $1 on the $100 and laid on a special tax above the dollar Jimit of exactly the same amount, $720,000, for such an "emergency expense" as taking care of the streets. It needs no legal expertness to detect the juggling attempted in this appropria tion. Manifestly, it was a subterfuge to cheat the letter and spirit of the organic law, and that is precisely what Judge Sturtevant has decided. In the circumstances which San Francisco must reckon with, the- attempt to spend three-quarters of a million on a theory was something worse than foolish — it was almost criminal:' Even the chuckleheaded Hearst will not try to make people believe that the Geary street road could have been municipalized for this amount of money. Even Hearst knows that, no matter what it cost, the municipalized line could not have succeeded as an independent street \u25a0 railway unit, lacking exchange relations with the United Railroads. • Even Hearst knows that nobody beyond his little circle of dupes wanted a municipal railway on any such terms and that everybody in the town was suffering for lack of decent streets, decently swept and This decision, relieving the tax payers of a burden that they •could ill afford to shoulder, willbe commended by the vast majority of those who would have had to bear the burden. Judge Sturtevant may not only endure the condemnation of the Examiner but be proud of it. THE GOING AWAY OF AOKI AOKI is going home. That does not sound very terrifying. It might be a society note or some other' polite form of the publicity affected by fashionable people. The politician, again, might remark that the Japanese ambassador had "lost his job" and let it go at that, but not so the Washington correspond ent, who can smell blood 7.000 miles away. The journalist of . national capitals makes his. living by the stuff that dreams. are made of. In London he sees the war clouds forever hovering over the Balkans. In" Washington the bogie man, for want of better, is expected from Japan. Viscount Aoki has been recalled by his government. In this the Washington correspondents unanimously see visions and portends of war. Aoki was a polite man and knew how to behave at dinner Japanese opinion, it appears, did not approve Aoki's hobnobbing with the whites. He is called in and Japan is either preparing to drive us out of^the Pacific or at least to send us an ambassador who eats with his knife. Doubtless it' is not so bad as all that. One may suppose that there is politics in Japan even as there is politics in American, and a diplomatic berth in 'Washington should be counted "a soft snap" for aspiring Japanese nobles. It would not be polite to say that Aoki "got the ax,"' but, after all. the homely speech of the ward politician appears to fit the crime. The ambassador, whether he goes from America or from Japan or elsewhere, who becomes too friendly with his host makes himself an object of suspicion and attack at home. THE SECRETARY'S TOO CURIOUS RESEARCHES AMONG. the multifarious activities of the department of agricul ture is a searching inquiry into the nutritive value of foods. It is a form of research that Secretary Wilson regards with af fection, although it seems that an unscientific and bourgeois congress regards it with suspicion. There is, however, in the annual report of the secretary a sort. of halting confession of inadequacy of results in the most important field* of this inquiry. Thus: * { At Middletown, Conn., the results; of respiration calorimeter experi ments have been prepared. for publication on the subjects of muscular and mental as related to energy income and outgo and the demands of the body for food. From the elaborate experiments reported it does not* appear that mental work exercises a positive influence on metabolic activity— that is an the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxid and -.energy given off fj-om the body— nor does it modify the body demands for and energy. Muscular work, on the other hand, is absolutely dependent on- the energy supplied by the food or/material'stored in the body from previous food supply. 'The total energy output,' which may be readily determined with. the respiration calorimeter, is a definite -measure of the totabv. ; ork per formed by the body, and hence of the amount of energy v w;nich*the food must supply, for .the performance of a given kind and amount of work. In other words, it is possible to determine with the respiration calorimeter energy requirements as expressed in dietary standards.

"The- Scarlet Woman,'- for ex EDITORIAL PAGE No Comfort lor ''Malefactors -of : Wealth" In President RoQseydt's Latest Message PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S message to Con^ grcss restates his position as.to'trusts and .com binations in restraint of competition with but little change from his less formal; expressions .of opinion. If there is successful dishonesty among the wealthy all the power of the national govern ment must be employed to punish and restraint; lf injury or loss come from the exposure of fraud they are. responsible who did the frauds, not he ; whd turned on the light. v -•, •\u25a0•-;-. ' As for trusts and combinations.' they are 'gootl' and bad, but theprcsident docs not scan quite^clea'r in his mind about parting the sheep from ;4hc; goats. He would have the Sherman law against trusts amended so as to make some sort of, reservation for the good trusts, but apparently he has not found any rule of thumb much less a scientific measuring stick by which to test the morality or public, policy of any given combination, trust or union. As nearly as may be gathered from his words, the 'matter might "be left to the discretion or judgment of an executive, board vested with semi-judicial functions' in'this regard. It is a problem of-the utmost dif ficulty and it is not clear that the president's:solu tion is adequate or practicable. \u0084. . . '«' * . Touching the regulation of interstate commerce the president asks' an extension of federal authority in the way of,supervision and regulation. To quote: The; most vital need is in comicction' with the rail roads. As to these, in my judgment, there, should now be cither a national incorporation act or a law licensing rail way companies to engage in interstate commerce .upon certain conditions. The law should be so- framed^ as to give to the interstate commerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means) should be provided to enable the commission,^ whenever j in its judgment it is necessary, to make V physical valua-i tion of any railroad. As I stated in my message to the congress a A'ear ago, railroads should be given power t6 enter into agreements, subject to the agreements being made public in, minute detail and to the consent, of the interstate commerce commission being first obtained. -Untifc the national government assumes, proper control "of tih terstate commerce in the- exercise of the authority it'al ready possesses, it will be impossible either to give to ox get from the railroads full justice. , The railroads i and all other great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must come; the only question is as to what gOA r ern-' mental body can most wisely exercise it; : The courts -will determine the limits within -which the federal authority can exercise it, 'and there will still rcvnaln ample .'.work within each state \u25a0 for the ' railway; 'commission of, that state; and the national interstate xommerce commission will work in harmony with the several state commissions, each within Its own province, to achieve the desired* end. The president sees that the .trusts Ira ve , come to stay. Combination is the great fact of modern'in dustrial conditions, whether ' they affect labor , or capital. The president repeats : ' \u25a0-;\u25a0\u25a0< \u25a0 The aim of the national government' is quite a's,"rnujch l to favor and protect honest corporations, honest business-..! men of wealth, as to bring to justice those individuals and \ corporations representing dishonest methods. -Most cer tainly there will be no" relaxation by' the governmentriauv thorities in the effort to get "at /any great railroad wrecker — any man who by clever swindling devices-robs investors, oppresses wage workers and does injustice to the general public. 'i "- '' \u25a0--'•"\u25a0• *0.-^ A\ r hat is a bad trust ?' Well, here..is I .an .a ttempt* by the president to answer the question:: -<\u25a0:•- •? A combination should not, be tolerated, if it abuse the, power acquired by combination to the public-. detriment;- j No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstate commerce that is formed for the; purpose of, or-whose operations create a monopoly or general control of the ' production; sale, or distribution of 'any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of general use and necessity. Such combinations are against public policy. . That is very well and very obvious; "but. in the last resort much is left to. the discretion or. judgment of a court or commission passing on the. facts' o^ ] each case. Moreover, competition itself der suspicion. It appears, and it is -true.' that there is good competition and bad competition as well as good and bad trusts. As the president says: Among the points to be aimed at should be the pro hibition of unhealthy, competition, such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the .purpose of crushing out i competition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and the prohibition of a corporation's making exclusive trade, with itself a condition of having any trade with itself. - It is a subject of extraordinary complication that '. the president has done his; utmost to': unravel with , an honest purpose and partial success., He is almost , a pioneer in this. difficult field,, which. none of .his i predecessors has pretended to cultivate.-: •;. -- \u25a0 The president makes no specific rccommeiida- i tions . in regard to currency reform, but mentions < with some favor the plan offered by former. Secre tary Shaw to give elasticity to the circulation in this i wise: " . \V- \ According to this plan national banks should be per- < mitted to issue Va specified proportion of their capital >jn ; notes of a given' kind, the issue to be taxed at so .high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legiti- ( mate trade.

' .-.<"• Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in Vabo.r disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in ;<\u25a0 the* maids f of those who feel that their rights are being '. invaded and their liberty of action and of speech un ' jvarcaqtahly restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of the -attack on the use of the process of injunction is • wholly withont warrant, but I am constrained to express >. the belrefthat for some of it there is warrant. This ques • tion is becoming more and more one of prime importance, and uiilcss the courts will themselves deal with it. in effec tive manner it is; certain ultimately to demand some form " of -legislative action. It would be most unfortunate for our t social welfare if 'we should permit many, honest and ; law abidmg citizens to feel, that they had just cause for , regarding our courts with hostility. '.. h earnestly commend to the attention of the congress this matter, so that some way \niay be devised -whicii. will limit tne abuse of in junctipris. and protect those rights which from time to , time it unwarrantably invades. Moreover, discontent is often expressed with thejisc of the process of injunction by. the courts, not oiily in labor; disputes, but where state . laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question, as I am informed that it will so*on receive the ; consideration of the supreme court. The president ploads, for a discreet use of in junction powers by the courts in labor cqntroversies and actions to restrain the enforcement of state ; laws. -He points out that \u25a0 the temporary writ of ; injunction is .'sometimes "tyrannically used to ac ; complish a permanent decision." I The message recommends that the .eight hour I day he extended as far as practicable to all govern ; ment work. The president strongly insists on strin gent legislation covering the work of women and children and believes that the national, government should supplement regulation by the states by ex cluding from- interstate commerce the product of child labor. With regard to the river systems the . ;nessage says : Our great river systems should be developed as na tional water highways; the Mississippi, with its tributaries, standing first in importance," and the 'Columbia second, although there, are many others of importance on the Pacific, the -Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national government- should undertake this wqrk, and I hope a beginning will be made in the present congress. Irrigation, the revision of the land laws and the conservation 'of forests and mineral deposits are treated at some length. The progress of the Pan ama canal is'noted and the need for wider locks is suggested. With regard to shipping subsidies, the ' president say : \u25a0~ V |.. ; 'The .unfortunate failure of the , shipping bill at the ] last session of the. last congress was followed by the Staking off of certain Pacific steamships, which has greatly hampered the movement of passengers between Hawaii , arid/.the, mainland.. Uriless- the^^ congress is prepared by positive encouragement to 'secure' proper facilities in the way;of shipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then ..the coastwise, shipping; la\ys should' be. so far relaxed as to prevent Hawaii suffering as it is now suffering. ' J-V:ConcerningJ -V: Concerning campaign contributions, the presi dent believes that the expenses of candidates shoiild be paid by the government. He proceeds : - y - * The need- for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if congress provided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great na tional parties, an appropriation ample enough t^o meet the necessity for thorough organization and machinery, which requires a large. expenditure of "money.- Then the stipula tion should be made that no party receiving campaign funds from' the treasury -should accept more than a fixed amount from any individual subscriber or donor, and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided. ' \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0 The president, approves the practice of first class powers to subsidize mail carrying lines thus: It is the duty of.a first class power, so far a*s practicable, to carry its «>cean mails under its own flag; the fast ocean steamships and their crews required for such mail service are valuable. auxiliaries to the sea power of a na tion. Furthermore, the construction of such steamships insures the maintenance- in an' efficient condition of "the shipyards in which our battleships must be built. ,_ The expenditure of. public' money 'for the" performance of, such necessary^ functions' of government is certainly warranted, nor is it necessary todwell upon the incidental benefits to our foreign commerce, to'the ship building in dustry and to ship owning and navigation Avhich will ac cdmpanyrthe discharge ; 6fthese N urgent public duties, though they, too, should have weight. The president advocates the building of four bat tleships of the' largest size and explains the voyage of the fleet as a practice cruise. - The message on the whole contains little "more than an amplification and reiteration of Roosevelt's well known policies. He; has nothing to take back of what he has said and "certain malefactors df great wealth" will .find small consolation in the docunient. The chief fault of the, message is its unnecessary, length. • '.;.. \u0084 - By The Call's Jester "Whpn Phyllis pours the tea" has lone ' -IJeen theme for. minor verses, And Mazie at the chafing dish Kelps poets , fill their purses. \ Without a doubt : these maids are fair ' And worth much time and travel- But more attention far is paid ' When Cannon wields the gavel. \ - , * * '• •. , • .
