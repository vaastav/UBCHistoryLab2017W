WASHINGTON. Dec. 6-At noon today the nrst regular session of the fifty-fifth congress was launched upon the unknown seas of legislation. Simultaneously at both ends of the capltol, Speaker Reed in the house and Vice President Hobart in the senate, dropped their gavels and called to order the bodies over which they preside. The sun shone brig.itly from a cloudless sky, making glotlous the bright December day, with a tinge of frost in the air and a breeze just strong enough to keep the stars and stripes snapping from flagstaffs. At the capltol crowds swarmed into the corridors at an early hour and choked the marhie steps as they ascended to the galleries from which they were to view the show. As usual on such occasions, the reserved galleries were carefully guarded, admission being only by card.and the public had great difficulty in wedging itself into the limited space set aside for It. In the Senate. The attendance upon the session of the senate today both on the floor and in the galleries was notably large, despite the well understood fact that little business bf yond the presentation of the president's message and the proceedings incident thereto would be transacted. Prior to the convening of the senate, ths members passed a half hour In ex changing greetings. Hanna, of Ohio, who has been ill for a week, was given a cordial welcome by his Republican col leagues. Woicott of Colorado, one of the members of the monetary commission, was given a warm reception. Dr. Godfrey Hunter, of Kentucky, the recently appointed minister to Guatemala, was an interested spectator to the pro ceedings. When the senate convened after the re cess. Hen. H. P. 8. Money, the new sen ator from Mississippi, entered the cham ber, but the oath of office was not admin istered to him during the session. The re ception and the reading of the president's message was the only feature of the da^. The senate chamber at The opening of the session today was a veritable con servatory. The floral display was beauti ful. Precisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of Vice President Hobart fell, and the sen ate was called to order. The invocation was delivered by Dr. Miiburn, the blind chaplain. Seventy-seven senators re sponded on roll call. The venerable Mr. Morrill of Vermont was the first recog nize! by Vice President Hobart. He of fered a resolution, which was passed in the usual fonn. that the secretary Inform the house that the senate was In session and ready to proceed to business. Allison of lowa presented a resolution tha' a committee of two senators be ap pointed ts Join a like committee from the house to inform the president that con gress v,*as in session, and prepared to re-

Dec. 6-The opening day In the regular session of the house passed without incident of any character. The formal; *ies attending the inauguration of the session are dry. ar.d, except as a spectacle; hardly authorised the crowds which thronged the public and private gal lerie-s. Yet the visitors sat through the whole proceeding. Dtngley. the floor leader of the majority; Bailey, the ret -gnixed leader of the minor ity. and Grosvenor of Ohio enjoyed the dis tinguished honor of being appointed to wait upon the president, whose message was. of course, the ever.t of the day. Its reading was long and tedious, but it was followed with close attention by the members and spectators in the galleries. There was no demonstration untii the reading was con cluded. when the R«=*publicans joined in a hearty expression of approval. immediately after the reading of the mes sage. the house adjourned out of respect to the memory of Senator George, of Mis sissippi. and Representative Wright, of Massachusetts, who di-ed during the recess. The house of representatives presented an animated appearance long before noon The surrounding corridors were filled with jostling, moving crowds, and before 11 o'clock the galleries which overlook the floor were with people. Floral trib utes for members were numerous and in some instances imposing. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12 o'clock Speaker Reed, attired in a black cutaway coat and wearing a red tie, as cended the rostrum. On the crack of the gavel the din on the floor and conversation in the galleries were subdued. In the deep silence which followed calling the assemblage to order. the prayer of the eminent divine Rev. Charles A. Bonry. of England, who delivered the invocation, was solemn and impressive. The speaker then declared the house in session. The roll call showed the presence of 301 members. There were fifty-three vacancies from deaths and resignations during the recess, and the credentials of members elect were read by the direction of the speaker, who administered the oath of of fce to them. On motion of Dlngley a resolution was adopted for the appointment of a commit tee of three to join the senate committee to wait upon the president and inform him that congress was ready to receive any communication desired to make. The speaker selected Dingiey, Grosvenor and Bailey for this honor. On motion of Henderson of lowa, it was ordered that the daily sessions begin at noon each day. The house then took a short recess. When the house reassembled the commit tee appointed to wait upon the president re ported having perfected its mission. Mr. Pruden. who bad followed the com mittee into the hall. Immediately presented the message, which, by direction of the speaker, vsas read at the clerk's desk. The message was listened to with great earnestness, especially the portions dealing with currency reform and our attitude to ward Cuba. There was no demonstration until the conclusion, when the Republicans Joined in a round of applause. Lawrence, Rep., of Massachusetts, offi cially announced the death of his predeces sor. the late Representative Wright, and Alien. Dera., of Mississippi, the death of Senator George. Out of respect to their memories, the house, at 3:05 p. m., ad journed tiil tomorrow.

English Paper* Inclined to Pral*e the Currency Feature and the Moderate Tone on t'«il»n. LONDON. Dec. 7.—The Daily Chronicle describes the message as "weak and color less. compared with the. vigorous handling of public questions to which Mr. Cleveland accustomed us." The Morning Post, after paying a tribute to the president's fine sense of duty. In the face of domestic trouble, in sending the message at the appointed hour, says: "On the Cuban question the president is vague and diffuse, but studiously correct." The editorial specifically praises Presi dent McKinley's treatment of the curreucy question. The Times says: "Its tone of patronizing tolerance will make the message not wholly agreeable to Spain. Probably flu- president calculates that If he can satisfy the jingoes for a time with eloquent denunciations and warnings, he will find it easier to pursue a moderate policy. "Regarding his currency proposals. It seems too probable that Mr. McKinlcy still clings to th* notion that something may be done for silver. So long as he follows that will o' the wisp hi 1 can hardly be expected to attempt any thorough-going reform of the currency." The Standard says: "The best that can be said of the mes sage is that it is absolutely unexciting. As a distinguished politician, the president la bored under grave difficulties, and it is no reproach to his skill that he has failed to surmount them." Me\tenn View*.

GALVESTON. Dec. 6.—Hon. William J. Bryan reached here today and left with a party of friends for Lake Surprise to hunt ducks. The party will he rone three or four d.\ys. Mr. Bryan expressed himself as follows on the president's message: "The message indicates an intention up on the part of the president to aid in turn ing the issue of paper money over to the national banks, and in the meantime a pur pose to give gold a further superiority over silver as money."
