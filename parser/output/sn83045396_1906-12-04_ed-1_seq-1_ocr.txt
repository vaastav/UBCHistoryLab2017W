The Fifty ninth Congress bogan its last session at noon toda3 It took tho Senate fifteen minutes to arrange its preliminaries, aud the House an hour. The Senate received from President Koosevelt a long list of appointments for its confirmation, and in executive session of nineteen minutes decided, as the nominations had been received before the body had been organized formally, to make no con firmations until the President's annual message had been received and tho ses sion fairly started. Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania and Forakcr of Ohio camo forward with resolutions of inquiry regarding the dis charge of the negro troops of the Twenty-filth infantrj-. One was addressed to the President and tho othor to the Sec retary of War. After the ripple of sur prise had passed and Vice-President Fairbanks had suggested that it. was unusual to transact any business until the President's message had been re ceived, the resolutions went over by unanimous consent. New Senator Sworn In. Senator Dupont of Delaware took the oath of office. Tho opening of the two houses was witnessed bT an animated throng which filled the galleries to their capacity. Hundreds went away disap pointed in not gaining 'admission to witness the session of either Senate or House. Nol in years has a larger number of members-elect of the lower house of Congress presented themselves at the Speaker's desk to take the oath of of fice. Death has been unusually active among the membership during the clos ing days of the last session and the be ginning of the present, and Chaplain Couden feelingly called the attention of tho bod- to the. work of the grim reaper during the months siuce adjournment. Speaker Cannon appointed Represen tative James R. Mann of Illinois as a member of the Board of BegentB of the Smithsonian Institution, vice BobertJR "Ilitt of Illinois, deceased. Galleries Crowded Early. The galleries of the House were crowded at au early hour. The absence of flowers from the desks of the mem bers was much commented on, but tho order of the Speaker, prohibiting the floral display, was generally commended for its good sense. A similar rule was made in the Senate two 3'ears ago. Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, daughter of the President, occupied a seat in the executive galley, accompanied bv Miss Hagner, social secretary of the wife of tiie President. Tho routine work of the House inci dent to the opening day was quickly dispatched, the roll call showing nearly 300 members present. Representative Bourke Cockran of New York, who recently married Miss Idc. was the subject of heartv laughter when his personal request that he be permitted to absent himself for an in definite period on account of business was laid before the House 03' the Speaker. House Soon Adjourns. After the appointment of the usual committee to wait, upon the President and inform him that the House was organized and ready to receive any commiiuicatiQn he might desire to make of interest, to the public service, tho Mouse adjourned out of respect to the memory of the deceased members. President Roosevelt's message will be received, both in House and Senate, tomorrow. No bills were introduced in the Sennlc. In the House there wore th'rty-eiglit public measures and 350 of a private character. Smoot Case Up Monday.'

Senntor Foraker explained tch pur poses of his resolution in an interview, as follows: "The resolution sneaks for itself. I cannot discuss it. 1 will sav, however.

It is a question of constitutional power on the one hand and constitutional and statutory rights on the other. Until wo have a com plete record 1 do not. know just whut questions will-arise, but we "may have to consider whether a man can be con victed of felony by order, and whothcr, following such a conviction, sentence mny be imposed and punish ment inflicted by order. Discharges without honor may be granted where they arc not based on an oll'enso against the law of the land, the commission' of which is denied, and where no punish ment follows. But where there is con viction, sontonce and punishment, I have alwoys supposed there would havo to bo also trial, either in a civil court or- in. a court-martial ' before some oilier tribunal thereunto" duly ap pointed by law. But it' is idle to dis cuss any of these questions until we" know whether they are raised by 'the record. " ' ' -Tvo;: Eanchers Meet Nenr-EsT-comlido, Cal., and One Is Slain.

Three corpses found by the side of the road between Eseondulo and San Luis "R03' dam, are the result of what was but a casual meeting of two ranchers named Howard Gore and Edward .Brady this morning. The two havo been at enmity for some time over a lawsuit over a claim Gore is alleged to have jumped, and it is said that mnii3- threats havo been made. This morning the two mot on the highway sixteen miles from Es coudido, in what is known as Jlell.'s Hole canyon, along the lino of the Es condido irrigation ditch. The dispute was renewed and Gore shot Brady, Kill ing him. Wifo Gets the Gun. Mrs. Brndj-, who was present, got hold of a gun and shot Gore, who then Hucceeded iu killing Mrs. Brady before he died. Gore is understood to be unmarried, but flnidy had been married twice, his divorced wifo being now Mrs. E. M. Abel of Escondido. It is said that when tho three met this morning the Bradys were unarmed, while Gore carried his ride and immedi ately began firing at Brady. Two shots took effect, but, though serioushy wound od, Brad was able to got to an opon ditch, where he sought to protect him self from Gore's fire, Gore ran up to the ditch aud deliberate' fired on Brady j killing him. He then turned his attention to Mrs. Brad3". who had atart ed to advance.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3. Mayor Schmitz aud Abraham liuefl appeared before Superior Judge Duune toda3' for arraignment on charges of extortion preferred b3' tho grand jury. The courtroom was thronged with spectnt ors. No ovation greeted the Mayor when h eapproached the Temple Shcfith Israel, which contains the court where his trial will take place. lie was ac companied b3 his attornevs and when he took his seat before tho bar there wns no greoting between himself and RuefT, who had arrived earlier with his counsel. Their actions seemed to indi cate that, tho relations betweeu the Ma3'or and RuelT had become strained. Attorneys for the two indicted men asked that the arraignment bo post poned for one week, pleading the fnct that tho Mnj'or had arrived in the city only a few days beforo and had not had time to confer with his counsel. As sistant Disirict Attornoy Henc3' object ed to dclaj- in the case of Rueff, while admitting that it could be fairl3' grant ed to Mayor Schmitz.

Tt was while the Bradys were at tho latter place that Goro moved on tho Government land and had to be forced off by an eject ment suit. Brad3' and his wife moved back to the claim and it was there that tho shooting of this morning took place. THIS IS NO MUSHROOM GROWTH That tho growth of Salt Lake is and will be of the substantial kind is thoroughly assured. There is no booming, in the common understanding of that word, in the expenditure of millions .of dollars by the railroad com panies in the installation of permanent improvements in their terminal facilities and in the construction of splen did passenger stations. Another thing: No railway company will spond millions of dollars on a mushroom town. Officials of those corporations make large investment only in localities which they know are of sufficient stability and progrcs-siveness to assure proper returns. Tho fact that real estate dealers horo aro every day obligod to turn away applicants for businoss quarters be tokens growth along solid business lines. While several large structures arc to bo orcctod as soon as material can be brought hero, thcro Is ovory reason to believe that the town's growth will be so rapid and substantial that its business needs will not be entirely satisfied for some years to come. Every year this State produces, millions upon millions in all sorts of farm truck; enormous sums come from tho gold, silver, coppor, load and coal mines; and the beet sugar industry is assuming immense proportions. In them selves these arc great permanent supports to a thriving community. But there are the mighty iron ore beds of Utah which so far have not boon touched. The valuo of these runs into so many billions of dollars that any at tempt at computation would bo usoloss. Sonio day thcro will be great iron furnaces and forges put into Iron county and another woalth-making industry will be added to tho support of this commonwealth, Thon thorc aro the Humor ous beds of asphaltum and gilsonito, which have only just boon scratched up to the present time. Thcro. aro proba bly ton thousand squaro miles of territory in oastorn Utah in which these products abound in groat quantity. Tho millions which will come from these sources will help this town wonderfully. The fact that', the State is full of natural resources establishes tho permanency of this city's future it is to be the Solid American Salt Lake. V )"
