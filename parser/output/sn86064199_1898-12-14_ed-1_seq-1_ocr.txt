SOUNDS THE -KEYNOTE For the Campaign Of 1900, and Seemingly Aban dons Silver As An Issue. Savannah, Ga., Deo. 14. William Bryan yesterday relinquished hia command of the Third Nebraska regi ment. Upon leaving he gave to the press an authorized interview. Some significant passages follow: "I may be In error, but in my judar ment our nation is in greater danger ust now than Cuba. Our people de fended Cuba against foreign arms: now they must defend themselves and their country against a foreign idea, the col onial idea of European nations. Here tofore greed has perverted th9 govern ment and used its instrumental inter ference for private gain, but now the very foundation principles of our gov ernment are assaulted. 'The imperialistic idea is directly antagonistic to the idea and ideals which have been cherished by the American people since the signing of the declaration of independence Our nation must give up any intention of entering1 upon a colonial policy such as is now pursued oy European coun tries or must abandon the doctrine that governments derive their lust Bryan has attracted a great deal of in terest among senators and representa tives to day regardless of political division. Many republicans have formed the impression that the late candidate of the democrats for the pre sidency sounds the keynote for the campaign of 1900, and that Bryan him self has come to the conclusion that silver could not be made the issue again. "Those people in New York," said Bland of Missouri this morning, "only wish we would let silver drop. Silve r is stronger today than two years ago ana . republicans can make up tbeir minds that the same old plank will be in our next platform." Leader Bailey takes the same view and insists that Bryan and silver will be the next combination. McMillin and other well known de mocrats talk as if silver will certainly be kept d the front. Senators Mor gan, Cockrell, Vest, Teller, Allen, Stewart, both of the Joneses, and in fact leading senators in democratic, populist, and silver republicrn cir cles len decidedly to the opinion that no issue can crowd out silver.

"Jefferson has been quoted in sup port of Imperialism, but our opponents must diatingush between expansion in the we-tern hemisphere and expansion that involves us in a quarrel with Eu rope and the Orient. They must still further distinguish between expansion which secures contiguous territory for future settlement and expansion which secures us alien races for future sub jugation. "Some think a fight should be made aeainst the ratification of the treaty, but I prefer another plan. It will be easier, I think, to end the war at once by ratifying the treaty and then deal with the subject in our own way. The issue can be presented directly by a resolution of congress declaring the policy of the nation upon the subject. The president in his message says our only purpose in taking possession of Cuba is to establish a stable govern ment and then turn the government over to the people of Cuba. Congress could reaffirm this purpose in regard to Cuba and assert the same purpose in re gard to the Philippines and Porto Rico. Such a resolution would make a clear cut issue between the doctrine of self government and the doctrine of impe rialism. We should reserve a harbor and coaling station in Porto Rico and the Philippines in return for the ser vices rendered and I think we would be justified in asking the same concession from Cuba." B.-yan says that he will throw all his influence in the 6cale against the expansion policy. Washington, Dec. 14. The au thorized interview of William J. For a Youth Who Turned Bandit.
