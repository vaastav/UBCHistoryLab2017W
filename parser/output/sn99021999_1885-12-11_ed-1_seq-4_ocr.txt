The acceptance of the Dolphin nnd thi successful launch of the new cruise ; Chicago mark the prar-tlcul beginning o the reorganization of the navy. It is trui that htops toward increasing the naval establishment tablishment were taken during ( ho las republican administration. But then was n lack of conlidenco In provailliif methods In the department pcrvadliij both political parties. This found spec ial I'.xpre ion in tlio democratic IIOHM which controlled appropriations am acted as a bar to extended ellbrU. JCo\\ \ that the adminiotration has ehangcil there is every reason to believe that 0111 navy will bo placed on a footing com mensur.itu with the importance of the nation and the extent of our coast line 'I admirable report of Secretary Whit ney on the needs of the navy murks an epoch in the dreary line of incnmpi'tcnl olllcials at the head of that department It is the work of n man of ability , character - actor and courage , and will at once ill' ' .spiro conlidcnce that whatever money * may be appropriate ! for naval reorganl' zation will bo applied for the purpose.- for which they are intended. Mr. Whit ney him worked laboriously in probing tu the bottom tiio defects of the naval de partment and he presents his result- fairly und emphatically with the clear ness of a practical hiisineKs man nnd the conciseness of a lawyer's brief to court. The secretary's tlicoiy of the proper or ganization u ( the department is bimple and orderly. He tinds the cause of of the past wastefulness In the service to 1)0 1 in proper and eonllictinir organiza tions. Ho proposes to have his olliee di vided into three principal departments. He wishes one sot of experts to buy tlio materials to bo utilised by the navy. They must bo judge * of the prices as well as of the qualities of the supplies. Another .set of experts are desired to car ry on the constructive work of the ser vice. They must bo exports in the busi ness of making and repairing ships and guns , and all that belongs to them. The third department will direct the move ments of bhips , Heels , and the thousands of ollicor ? . and men employed on tlit-in. Those three bureaus are to take the place of the many which at present c.xiitand the accounts of each are to bo kept just as a pralical and common sense business man would keep the books of a great es tablishment and its diU'erent depart ments. Mr. Whitney asks that congress shall reorganize the naval department before rcorgani/.ing the navul establish ment. Ho then promises the best results from the expenditure of whatever ap- pronriations may bo made for rebuilding tlio navy. I'arnoll'fj Triumph. The Knglish elections nro over and the result is n practictil triumph for P.irnoll. Ncillar ot tuo great English parlies has u working majority over the other and the 1'arnellites combined. The national ist campaign lias resulted ifs iU l.-uder decreed , and the uncrowned king o. ' Ire land will como to Westminster backed by a following whoso united strength can be thrown at any time as ho may elect to elevate or defeat either a conservative era a liberal ministry. Unless an unl.k.ily combination is made between the liber als and conservatives to res'ust all .Irish demands , Air. Parnell and his party will bo dictators of all legislation in tlio coin ing parliament. To the English people generally the situation will bo a mo.s humiliating one and demands are al ready made for a prompt dissolution of the parliament and a new appual to the country. It is safe lo bay that the ex pense and excitement of n new electoral campaign w II not be forced upon the country until tliu experiment of conduct ing parliament under tint new condi lions has been attempted by the present party loaders. Mr. Gladstone seems inclined to make heavy bids for the Pur nulliioHiipportand Mr. I'arncll , in turn , if tlio cable dispatches are to bo credited , is not diriinolini'd to a renewal of the treaty of Kilmainhum. It renuind to bo been xvh.it compromise can bo decided upon which will secure iinitml liberal support and prove .satisfactory to the nationalist party. So far the leader of thi ) nationalist.- , has declined l > formu late Ins programme for Si > lf-governni"iit in Ireland Wnat it is to include and what to exclude is a matter of profound importance to Knglibhmcn , Any step looking toward the dissolution of the im perial union will be certainly opposed by both branches of the liberal party. If the tory lenders are to be bolhived , any movement which trenches on imperial inthority in purely Imperial matters , such is taxation , and tlie military and nuva jsjubliihinonts , will not receive the sup iiort of Lord .Salisbury's ministry. It is casonablo then to believe that what- ivcr coalition is rondo must ; e between the liberals and the . 'nriiollitos as against the conservatives , inch an alliance would mean a majority ) f 170 voU'S over the conservatives and n eturn of the liberals to power. If Mr , 'arnoll is prepared to dollno what his tarty demands are , and if those demands lo not exceed the extent of local uitonomy which the liberal party Is pro- tared to allow , there is no reason why u trong working majority should not nice moni return thu liberal leaders to lower at Westminster , Under any cir- iiuistuncrs , Pnnioil'd power in thu next larliamiMit will bo decisive.

CLEVELAND'S cabinet huvo proved u'ins.L'lv'1'i Intelligent and practical men , ml industrious workers , It can bo tfuly Add that the annual reports iindod in from t'o various dopait.uonU ikon as a whole art ) thu ho > t and most iggoitive which have Issmul from the overnment press in years. The report ( the secretary of the treasury is ox- itnstivo in iu trcatnunito * the various iples under ruviow , unit l material for Intelligent debate and IrgH lation on the tariff nnd silver questions Mr. Latntir'a report is the tirat one tlml has Issued from the interior tloparttuenl for n long period which dcnls fearlessly with the abuses which have sprung tin in the land office , and norts the rights o ( the people as against the great corpora tions nnd syndicates who hnvo seized upon llio public domain. In Mr. Whitney's naval report the public will read with a sigh of relief the causes ol the demoralization in the construction department of tlio nnvy , and plain , com mon Sense , pr.tctic.il rcmodics for the evils of a bungling nnd cumin rous administration of the various bureaus. It looks as if Mr. Cleveland's administra tion was to bo n practical and business one. This is a cause for congratulation Irrespective of party. With all its dishonest buncombe about the civil service reform which ho preaches but declines to practice , Mr. Cleveland is beginning his administration In n man * tier which will commend him to the best elements in both parties , Tlio HUH Question. When the first complaints began la pour in about the inferior quality of the water gas , the l Kti was inclined to give tin1 company the bonolitof their apology that as soon as the works wore com- pleteil all grounds for dissatisfaction would be promptly removed. The works are done , or ought to bo if they are not , and the gas furnished to the city for street light and to our cili/.ons and mer chants for their homes and business houses continues to be of R decidedly in ferior quality. In addition to the poor quality of the light , there is a general complaint of Increased bills and rapidly revolving motors. Notwith standing the reduced price per thousand the cost for the same scrvicn proves to be much greater than under the old system. Consumers , who a year ago paid ? : ) and $10 for their ordi nary consumption of gas in November , Hud their bills this year more than doubled in aomo instances. The report of Gas Inspector Gilbert , who under stands his business thoroughly , shows conclusively that the light furnished is not up to the standard remiired of the company in their contract with the city. UuringXovembcr the standard was only It MO candle power for the month much below the contract requirements. The increase in the gas bills is duo to the rapid passage of tlio water gas through the meters under heavy pressure. Recent investigations of tlio New York state senate committee show that the name "gas-meter" is n misno mer. The motor conscientiously regis ters anything passing through it , from hot air to sewer gas. The amount of lightgiven in proportion to the thousand I'oi-t , as registered by a correct meter , is the only true test of relative economy be tween nnv two Illuminating gases. Using the comparison in the case of the water gas as now furnished , and the coal gas manufactured by the old company , the city is paying very dearly for its illumi nation. A bettor quality of gas in other cities is being furnished at ? 1Y.5 a thotist and , while Omaha , is charged double ilia amount for an article that can bo manu factured hero for 51 cents. Thu eity council should make n promp" and thorough investigation of the Mib- jcet. They are empowered to compel thu gas company to comply with tlmir con tract. So far as our citi/ens are con cerned , Omaha is growing largo enough for n computing company , and if no other remedy can bo found , steps ought lo betaken taken to form one. After the Tax Slurkora. Snnntor Van Wyck comes promptly to the front at the opening of tlio senate with his bill to make thu land grant roads pav taxes on their untaxt'd lands. Recent settlers in Nebraska who are not familiar with llio mollioils of the railroad tax shirkers will learn with astonishment that of the millions of unpatcntcd lands belonging to the railroads in tills state , not an acre has overpaid a dollar of state or county taxes. The process by which tlte companies have evad id taxation on their land grant is a disgraceful one. ' Under the ruling of the supreme court at Washington , it was decided that the Union L'.ioilio railroad had su.Hcicnt title in their lands to planter them with mortgage * . Under anotimr jug handled ruling in n cooked up case , it was decided that so long as no patents were taken out by the companies , the title to the btr.ds rumainod in the gov ernment nnd that taxation was illegal. The rules of the general land olllco re quire that all nnsiirveyed lands mint bu Hiirvoyed before application for patents will be considered. This is especially ncccbsary in the case of the land grants In order that the boundaries of the alter nate sections granted may bo defined and that titles may not issue to the railroads for hinds open to homostjad and preemption - omption under the general land laws. N'ow the. railroads , in order to prevent ihemselvos from being subject totivv- tion b.vhocuring full title to their lands through the issuance of patents , have re fused to have their lands mirvnvod. From limit to time , as they have sold parcels ilong their llnu.s , mirvoys have boon nude and patents lakun out , but of tlio nillloiu , of acres which still re- naln on thu hooka of thu railroad and olltco not an acre la subjjct to axation. Senator Van Wyek'd bill requires the iompanies to pay the cost of surveying mil locating thiisit lauds within sixty days iftor tliu piuH.iga of this net and provides hat in dofautt of such survey unit ( oca- ion the lands shall bj .suhjeat lo entry inder thu homustead and preemption aws and liable to taxation. Tliu muas- ire will of conr.su bj violently opposed > y thu railroad senators nnd thu monopoly ely lobby at Washington HS laying new nirdt-ns on thn overburdened corpora- ions. It ought to secure the support of very honest hunutor und congressman , t is founded on principles of equity , anJ u.stlce , which require that all shall bear heir duo proportion of the burdens of iiMitlim in return for their proportion of ho protection guaranteed by the law. ; 'hu railroad tax shirkum who for nearly wonty years have shifted thu expense of tate government upon the people by de clining to pay their taxes must bi brought to time. Senator Van Wyck deserves serves the tlutaks of the people of No hrakn for his persistent cA'orts In thcl behalf in spite of the rtbu.soof the corpor ution attorneys and the ridicule of tin brass-collared editorial brigade. TUB convention of cattlomf > n nt St Trulls , a short time ago , developed i number of very interesting facts and stn tistic.s. In 185U there were 18,000,000 cat tic in the country ; in 1830 , SO.OOO.OOO ; ti 18M15,000,000. . Jf put ! u a line , Iwolvc abreast , they would stretch twice ac/os ! the continent.
