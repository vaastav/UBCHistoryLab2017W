It was the mildest November on re cord in twenty years and there is no reason to kicu on the sample of Decem ber weather up to date. Editor S. T. Scott of the Lawton Republican has cut his paper down from a seven to a six column, which is a more convenient size to handle. Always honest and fair minded the Hannah Moon editorially endorses President Wilson's message to congress as being "'tense and businesslike." It is noted with the near approach of Christmas there is a commendable rivalry between the Fargo Forum and the Daily Courier-News as to who should assume the bountiful role of Santa Claus to the poor of the Gateway City. The season of dances, box socials and debating societies is again with us and a regular schedule interspersed with the latest up-to-date innovation of farmer's club meetings, will become effective after the holiday festivities and continue until spring's work starts. does The democratic tariff enactment not appear to be a deterent to the pro gress and prosperity of the Hannah Moon up along the bouudary line, which has lately blossomed out in a new dress of body type, adding greatly to that pa pper's usual neat and tidy appearance. There are only eleven more shopping days before Christmas and Langdon merchants have a selection for the holi day shopper that leaves no occasion for your trading with the catalogue houses of the larger cities—either as to variety to select from or the price you are asked to pay. With the approach of Xmastide one gives credence to all kinds of extrava gant ideas, but when the Hillsboro Banner offers as a premium to its sub scribers a 600 page book l'Mv Attain­ ment of the Pole," by Dr. Frederick A. Cook, one is prone to speculate what kind of ancestry might possibly exist between Editor L. E. George and the deceased Ananias. Under a new law passed at the last session of the state legislature, all taxes have to be paid on real estate, including the 1913 tax. in order to transfer the property free from encumbrance, ac cording to the understanding of Regis ter of Deeds J. L. Swartz. Several warranty deeds presented at the office of the register of deeds for registration since December 1st have been sent back because the 191.r taxes bad not been paid and the auditor could not, there fore certify that the county had DO valid claim against the property. Speculation as to 1914 municipal im provements will soon be in order, per haps more particularly among those of citizens who "push" than among those known as "knockers." In the past, when the question of public improve ments has been mooted at, the old bugaboo of Langdon's pre-historic rail road depot has been taken afresh from the shelf, carefully dusted of its cob webs and with much complacency held up to view in all its rare antiquity of design and convenience. This is as it should be and our citizens must keep after the Gt. Northern until we get a new depot, be in the 530.000 architec tural extravagance that was coming all last year, or one of proportions more adequate of realization. But there are improvements needed for the growth of Langdon, and more demanded for public welfare needed up town. The city can never size up with its sister towns over the state until we have, a modern city hall, the present headquarters of muni cipal administration being fully as much a back number as the ramshackle uld depot down on Jim Hill's right-of-way. Along the same line of thought occurs the immediate need of something being done to make possible the installation of a proper system of drainage and the extension of the city's tire protection to the residential portion of Langdon lying west of Sixth street. Last year and the year before we did things to be proud of, built a $10,000 public school building and put in street improvements and cement sidewalks which aggregated an other $15,(XJO. If Langdon does some thing on the lines outlined here it is pretty certain that building activities would resume in tuch a manner as would surprise the most sanguine. Then might wu confidently assure our Helves of a new depot yos, and oven the Hour mill, which for years has been a mere monument of Langdon's enterprise of long years ago, might agitiii resume the activity of a home industry us it fttiould. The situation in a nutshell in, that if we would have other* do uouio tiling wo must do wouiethiuy oun»elven, Let the motto of every citizen for JDM be. "W'ch Langdon (irovr The Osnabrock Independent is already running political cartoons on its front page and local candidates for office are said to be thicker than mushrooms The Osnabrock Iudependent notes with apparent satisfaction the way in which the papers of the First congres sional district are taking up the candi dacy of John S. Gogin as an opponent to the re-election of Congressman II. T. Helgeson. The Independent and its town of booster won't lose anything by working night and day for their towns man's nomination and in which case the Milton statesman would certainly have to go some next fall. The National Tribune, published at Washington, D. C., comes out in an editorial endorsement of Senator Mc Cumber of this state as a most suitable candidate for the republican nomination for the presidency, Sure, McCumber would be just the man for the republi cans—he's a standpatter of the good old style and has always been faithful to the interests of "big business" and they would undoubtedly see that he had a bountiful campaign fund, and this is what the "hungry ones" are looking for. By all means nominate McCumber—it would be as easy as "taking candy from a baby" to defeat him at the polls. Many references are now made com paring the winter so far with the so called warm winter of 1877-78. That was the first, winter that the writer spent in Pembina. In general the weather all winter was very much like the present winter. About Christmas time heavy rains occurred and cellars were flooded in the city. There was a change of troops at Fort Pembina and the regiment leaving, marched to Grand Forks on foot about Christmas time in the rain. The Red river froze up and there was tine skating nearly all winter, there being no snow, but opened up again during the winter for some time. The three winters following were all stormy and cold. Blizzards were very common and snow drifted high in the timber. During the winter of 1879-80 (we think) the coldest weather ever registered in the United States by the signal service was observed by Mr. Kabernagle then in the government ser vice at this point and the mark was 59% below zero—and strange to say it did not seem cold as the morning was'bright and clear. A little exposure however soon brough sensations that tallied with the thermometer. So if history repeats itself, then we will have to get the re action about twelve months from now, —though we are not prohesying. The only thing we are real sure about is that the first ten days of January in North Dakota are generally pretty cold.— Pembina Pioneer Express.
