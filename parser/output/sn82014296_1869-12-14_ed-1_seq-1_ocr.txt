Brooks said be had hoped the gentleman from Massachusetts would have redeemed the promise made to the last Congress, lo briuM in a general bill removing all ibese disabilities. He hoped to hear no more of this peddling amnesty of theOovernmtnt. but mat a general amnesty law would be passed, worthy of the charllv and generos ity of this great Oovernment, and that the statute bo jk would be no longer incum bered with these pardons in detail. Bntler was bappv to inform the gentle man Irom New iork that the considera tion of the bill to provide for the removal of disabilities from ttiose wbo had offend ed t he country by their rebellion, was now before the Commtttee, and he doubted not that as soon as other and more pressing duties could be attended to la that Com mittee, such a bill will be repotted, at least to knew It would be consideretf by the Committee, This bin was put forward pending the necessary d May in the con sideration of such a general bill, and to meet ihe exigencies of ihe case. Cox said be had objected the other day to this bill when the gentleman from Mas sachusetts introduced it substantially iu ills own mind. Although he did not press fiom the same reason glveu by bis col league (Brooks), it looked like small busi ness to oe peddling out amnesty of Govern ment in this sort of w?.v.

He give notice to the gtntleman from Mississippi that hereafter, whenever a bill came ou granting amnesties to personal Individuals, he snould internose bis oh. jectlou. He did not propose to do it on this occasion, for the reason that ihe men named in this bill had been oii'ertained to necessarily Federal offices; it was neces taiy they should have their pardon, in order thai they miht fill their luncltous. BuMer said he could not agree with the gentleman from New York in saying this was a small business. There una mnrn Joy in Heaven over oue sinner that re pented man over ninety-nine Just persons who nte.l no repentance. Cox remarked that be understood from that that the sinners pardoned by this bill belonged to the ltepubliean party. If they were Democratic sinners they would not be Included lu this amnesty, but the Democrats would forgive them freely if the gentlemen on tbe other side would forgive them. Generally these amnesties weie given as the consideration for treach ery, and lor the purpose of adding recruits to tbe Radical party, an! not out or that abundant generosity of which the gentle man from Massachusetts was himself so brilliant an example.
