Washington, Dec. 14.—T0-day’s debate in the Senate on tie Retrenchment Committee'sjpropo filthna has been more exciting than on any pro vious occasion since this project has been tinder consideration. It has developed more sharply than ever the lines between what are now come to be known as administration and anti-adminis tration Republicans. Heretofore there have been attempts to disguise the opposition to Trumbull’s amendment to the caucus resolution on various grounds, but principally that no necessity exist ed for the appointment of any such committee with such extraordinary powers as this amend ment proposes to confer upon them. To-day these feints gwero not resorted to, but Messrs. Morton. Edmunds, and Anthony openly avowed that they believed it to be an attack upon the President and his administration. It made no difference that Trumbull, Sumner, Schurz, Ferry, and Tipton quoted from the President’s message to show that he was in favor of remedying just such abuses as this committee proposed to cor rect. and that, in the light of this document, the amendment could not hut be regarded as an ad ministration! measure; and, further, that the Republican parly, by its history and professions, could not but be a reform party, and that its only ealvat ion was to work for the correction of evils inside of the organization itself. These state ments were met by assertions that the inferences to be drawn by the country {could not but bo inimical to the President and damaging in their effect to the Republican party. The debate was opened immediately after the morn ing hour had expired, by Mr. Wilson, who com menced with the observation that, as a mere mat* *.*t of political expediency, it was not wise to go ?*> the country with a divided Republican vote. Ou this proposition, as is usual with the Senator, he exhausted himself in trying to make as good a showing for one side as another. It must he faid to his credit, however, that when he sat down it was the general impression that he had said more in favor of the committee than against it, an impression which hisvote sub sequently corroborated. Mr. Wilson was follow ed by Mr. Nye. The Nevada Senator commenced and ended with a joke. He talked to the gal h rb*s, and endeavored to raise a laugh at the cr- Wnse of those who were earnest in desiring to Tm the civil service. He impugned the motives d those Republican Senators whom he accused with desiring to become greater than their jna-ter. and applied to tlwm tUo very lUktomr loriai epithet of soreheads. He was followed by Echui/, and as the Missouri Senator arose there was . general stretching of necks in prophetic cxr -elation that somebody would get hurt. This cx* station was not followed by disappolnt mc Schurz turned in the direction of Nye’a eca*. hut which had conveniently been vacant, and remained so until the vote was subs ‘quentiy taken, and remarked that there ev iden - ly was a sphere for clowns, hut ho doubted if tie usefulness of a public jester was not lim. ited o the walls of a theatre. From this he pro ceed £ to reply to Conkling's speech the day pre viou , and also to define what he meant by as gerti igthat there was some mysterious Influence nt tie White House which maintained the sronenj order system in New York in d-fiancc of public opinion and official remonstrance. He read fromthe report of the Retrenchment Committee to shew that he was .alluding to General Horace Porter. And then lame Tipton. The Nebraska Senator has Been li! bad humor for several days, and to-day he made one of his characteristic speeches. He always makes telling points, and his earnestness makes a p for his peculiarities of expression and manner. He was in favor of all kinds of reform,and especially those which were contemplated by Mr. Trum.jull’s amendment. He allued to the Presi dent as an intellectual Colossus, and to Nye as the’ irdof jovc, who soars ever onward and upw :tr d. He made a particular onslaught on ConliUng, who listened toitinhis seat without xop’ving one word- Ho said that it wa/ a pretty civil service which would all »vr Conkling to keep Butler in office out in Ne uraska against tho united wishes of the people th'-re and its delegation, and pointed to the impeachment of this official as the best com. m* ntary on his standing at homo. After Tipton, hi a general consent, a vote was reached on T. xmbull’s amendment, and the yeas and nays w re called, with the following result: j'v7jr—Alcorn, Bayard, BJair. Casserly, Cooper. Da vis (West Vn.) Fenton. Hamilton. Wiley, Johnston, He vr Logan, Patterson, Robertson. Saulslmrr, stev cns. jt‘ Stockton. Pwmner, Truman, Tipton, Trumbull, Vh •<,.Vs, West, Wilson—total, 34. „ ~ , A.Tj/rf—Amcs, Anthony, Boreman, Buckingham, f'-.hlwell Cameron, Carpenter, Chandler, Clavron, ' onklinp, Corbett, Cragin, Edmunds. Feny (Mich.). Tatmiran. Frelinghuysen, Gilbert, Hamhn, Hitch rock, Howe, Kellogg, Lewis. Morrill (\ tA. Morton. Xve, Osborne, Pomeroy, Pratt, Ramsey, Robertson, Sawyer, Scott, Sherman. Spencer, Stewart—total, 35. Terry, of Connecticut, who would have voted in the affirmative, was temporarily absent, while Harlan dodged. Immediately upon the announce ment of the vote Mr. Trumbull got the floor, and moved that the Senate now refer to the commit tee for investigation, and report the mattersand subjects named in the resolution he had first offered. This turn of affairs took those who had opposed his proposition for a tnorongh investiga tion w. !ly by surprise, and led to an excited and •pointed personal debate. As Trumbull was going on. in accordance with the universal custom, to speak on his resolution, Sherman sprang up. and, with a manner wholly at variance with his usual courteous bearing, made a point on Trumbull that he bad spoken twice on the same subject. This attracted the attention cf everyone by its imusual character, and there was quite a general murmur of disapprobation even on the part of tlic-e acting with Sherman at the evident attempt to choke Trumbull off, J-ui Sherman, in an excited on Lis point and refused to withdraw it, saying he wanted to speak himself. He then went on in a heated and abusive style in opposition to the pro position to refer the matters named by Trumbull li'T investigation. Trumbull, tofget the floor at all, was obliged to move au amendment to his proposition, and then began by sayiug that for the first time in an c-s, .ri'-nce of twenty years he had seen a Senator put down by this discourteous method. He then arraigned both Sherman and Morton for their re peated attempts to defeat a full investigation, iillirming that they stood day after day directly across the path of the President’s expressed wishes in regard to reform. At the close o his speechMr.Shenuan barred the way to further action by tactics common duriag this debate by me ring executive session. This was carried. The Senate soon adjourned HU Monday. The Se nate also agreed to meet In caucus again to-mor row. There is a very general ft fc u n g outside of ibe Senate among the friends of the President that Conkling and his assistants have blundered Ladly in their course. 

CHICAGO APPROPRIATION. The Committee ou Appropriations have consid ered FarwelTs bill for the purchase of grounds and erection of public buildings in Chicago, and ngreed to report it favorably, hat cutting down tbe sum named in tho original hill from five millions to four. THE STEAMBOATMEN. A delegation of steamboatmen, representing ibe ocean, lake, and river interests, were I'cforc the House Committee on Commerce 10-day, and presented their objections to the last steamboat law, and the rules and regulations of the Board of Supervising Inspectors. There is great unanimity among the VOLUME 25. etcdmboatmen from all sections, on the opinion that the law and rules are oppressive and unjust, and that in many respects the true interests of navigation have been sacrificed lor the benefit of owners of patent rights. The temper of the com mittee is entirely favorable to the steamboatmen in their efforts to frame a just and practicable law. r^. [To the Associated Press.] NOMINATIONS.

THE SOETIIEBN CLAIMS COMMISSION made their report to Compress to-day.

HERALD STORY The HernUVs special despatch from Washington says that it now appears to have been discovered that the British Government has completely out witted the Administration on that part of the Treaty at Washington providing for the. appoint ment of arbitrators, and that a decision averse to the position and interests of the United States will be the result of the Geneva Conference. Only two of the Jive arbitrators are friendly to a repub lican form of government. It is said that the up shot of this will ho a re-opening of the Alabama dispute. The Spanish Government is anxious to bring about a complication of this kind, and is supposed to favor England’s non-lia bility for the escape of the Alabama, because she desires to hold the United States responsible for the escape of Cuban privateers, and the protec tion given to the Hornet and Florida. This whole subject will be ventilated in the House in a few days, when the Alabama Treaty comes up for discussion. PENSION AGENT AT CINCINNATI. General Charles E. Brown has been nominated for Pension Agent at Cincinnati, rice William E. Davis resigned. BUILDING OF CHICAGO. A pamphlet was laid on the desks of members of Congress to-day, advocating a plan of the gov ernment aid toward rebuilding Chicago by the issue of money to owners of real estate, secured at long dates on the property. THE ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMISSION. The American and British Commission, to-day decided that the United States are not liable for the payment of debts contracted by rebel authori ties. OTHER NOMINATIONS CONFIRMED. The Senate in executive session confirmed tho following nominations: George H. Baker of Pennsylvania, Minister resident at Constantinople ; Thomas W. Bennett of Indiana, Governor of Idaho; Marsh Giddings, of Michigan, Governor of New Mexico : David B. Nevins, of Pennsylvania, Pension Agent for the Army Agency, Philadelphia; Horatio G. Sickles, Pension Agent for Invalid Pensions, at Phila delphia, rice William A. Forbes, suspended under the Tenure-of-Ofiice law. 

CONGRES SIGNAL. SENATE. Washington, Dec. 14. FOREIGN RELATIONS. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN presented the petition of the Venezuelan Steamship Company, asking redress for the seizure of their steamers by Ven ezuela, and said that the complaint against Ven ezuela might yet necessitate severe measures on the part of our government. Mr. SUMNER said that he had examined the question, and found his own country in tho wrong. Tho petition was referred. X'EMALB SUFFRAGE. Mr. BUCKINGHAM presented a memorial against woman suffrage, and said more than ten thousand of the most refined and respectable wo men in the country have signified to Congress their unwillingness to have tho responsibilities of suffrage thrust on them. This protest contains the names of many of the most respected, talented and influential women of the country. In looking over the list I find that I know many of them. They arenotmanlywomm.hutwomen of good sense, and their judgement is entitled to consideration. They don’t say anything about the abstract right of suffrage, but they say that hav ing already their full share of.the burdens and responsibilities of life, they fear that others more hold than they may succeed in having imposed upon them other burdens and responsibilities un suited to them, and therefore they ask Congress to protect them from these dangers. They say that the extension of suffrage to them will he adverse to tho interests of workingwomen; that it will introduce a fruitful element of discord into the existing marriage relation, and that it will he fraught with danger to the general good order of the country. I sympathize with them. I see no possible benefit which can arise by the extension of suffrage to women—benefit to them or to the country. ANOTHER PETITION. Mr. CONKLING presented a petition of New York soldiers in the late war, recounting the services of women In the war,andasking Congress to make some provision for acknowledgment of their heroic and charitable work. NEW BILLS. Bills were introduced and referred: Bv Mr. SCOTT—To promote the securing of efficient seamen for the navy. By Mr. HARLAN—For the relief of certain set tlers on the public lands in lowa. THE TARIFF—AN INQUIRY. Mr. TRUMBULL asked Mr. Sherman when the Committee on Finance intended to report the Bouse bill repealing ibo duties on coal and salt. Mr. SHERMAN said ho thought it unadvlsable to take up tariff matters separately from internal taxes. Mr. TRUMBULL. Then, I give notice that, to morrow, I will move to discharge the Committee on Finance from further consideration of the House bill repealing the duty on coal and salt. EIGHT-HOUR BILL. On motion of Mr. WILSON, the Senate took up the House bill to equalize the pay for working men under the eight-hour law. Mr. TRUMBULL’S amendment repealing the law was read, but, at the request of Mr. Wilson, Mr. Trumbull withdrew the amendment, in order not to embarrass the original bUL Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut, renewed it, when the bill was referred to the Committee on Fi nance. THE RETRENCHMENT QUESTION. The Senate then resumed consideration of Mr. Anthony's resolution to create a committee on retrenchment, with Mr. Trumbull’s amendment authorizing it to sit during the recess, and send for persons and papers. _ Mr WILSON warned his Republican friends that they were placing their party in a false po sition before the country. Already there wore millions throughout the country who believed that an attempt had been made in the Senate of the United Stales to shield the administration. He hoped there would be a unanimous vote for Mr. Trumbull’s resolution, so as to let tbe people see that the Republicans were determined to keep tbe administration pure in. all its departments. He had no sympathy with the plan of covering our own shortcomings by talking of gigantic swindles in New 1 ork. There were Republican thieves as well as Democratic thieves, and a Republican thief was to him far more hateful of the two, because ho brought disgrace upon the Republican party. but:uotwithstandiog tbe defects of the present administration, it was far purer and more effi cient than most of its predecessors. No previous administration had ever been so prompt m pun ishing delinquency among its officers. . Mr 

BLAIR. TheSenatorlsvcryboastfulahout the purity and rigor of the administration. ! wn-h to cull his attention to a L 'aso ih where the District Attorney and Marshal were both removed from office for procuring an Indict ment against a man for violating a law of the United States. , .. .. . Mr. WILSON. I do not know whether that was so or not. Mr. BLAIR reiterated the statement. Mr. WliisON said he was notboastful of the ad ministration. He simply desired to be just, and therefore ho said that the administration was seeking to progress in the right direction, al «m>ugh a good deal more of it was necessary. He was not one or those Republicans who thought party dead. Ho expected to en- ,i iS 1 * 5 ? 1 . m full force next year, and ho rained his friends against relaxing their efforts in any degree In the vain hope that they would meet no vigorous opposition in 1872. Mr. NYE opposed Mr. Trumbull’s resolution. Certain gentlemen in the Republican party, 'who thought the President was becoming too popular, had devised a scheme of civil service reform, and under that cry they were now attempting to re vive the old committee with all the extraordinary powers of sending for persons and papers. Mr. 

THURMAN. The Senator objects to send ing for persons and papers. Where was his voice on that memorable occasion when a committee of the House of Representatives was ex amining into the conduct and affairs of Senators, to discover whether they had not been bribed to acquit Andrew Johnson, and were ransacking the telegraph offices to get at something that might compromise those Sen ators ? Mr. NYE. Just whore it is now. Give me an other such set of circumstances, and I will vote for it again; but there is no such occasion now. There is peace in the ranks now, savo with one here and there who would be greater than his master. [Laughter.] Mr. SCHURZ replied to Mr. Nye, and in the course of his remarks said the legitimate sphere of the comedian is generally within the walls of a theatre, but if the Senator is satisfied with the role he plays here nobody else has reason to he dissatisfied. Those who defend a bad cause always resort to a certain lino of defence They attempt to throw suspicion on the motives of those who attack. So the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Nye) like other Senators here, makes no attempt to disprove any of the facta that I stated yesterday in regard to the New York Custom House, but simply throws aspersions upon my motives, and accuses mo of insinuating that Mr. Loot's service in the army should prevent him from obtaining employment in the civil service of the government, and that the President had something to do with the cartage business in New York, I wish to say a few words in reply to the Senator from Now York (Mr. Conkling). He said yester day that the investigation of the Now York Custom House was closed up by the Committee on Retrenchment last year. The committee did, un doubtedly, believe that the case was closed, for it had reason tobelieve that when suchscandals as it exposed were laid bare £ho administration would jump at the chance to put an end to the disgrace, but that it turns out that they were vastly mistaken, for the same scandalous system of robbery exists down to this day in spite of the exposures made by the com mittee. The Senator asked also why wo have proposed no legislation to remove these abuses. Because no legislation was necessary. The abuses were created by executive action in the administration of the Custom House, and they could be done away with by executive ac tion. The Senator objected to what I said of the power which sustains this system. I did say (having laid the evidence before the Sen ate) that when the most respectable merchants of New York had protested against this system of robbery; when the Secretary of the Treasury had time and again pronounced against it; when the Committee on Retrenchment had pronounced against it, and when it is still sustained and kept alive down to this very day. I did say, in view of this evidence, that there must be some mysterious power sus tainincthat system stronger than a decent regard for public opinion, and stronger than the Secre tary of the Treasury himself. Mr. 

PATTERSON here interposed to make an explanation, and in reply to the remark by Mr. Trumbull, said: I do say that there were inspect ors in the Custom House in New York who stated before the committee under oath that in violation of their ollloial oaths, and in violation of the laws of the land they had taken bribes, and that they took bribes every ime they discharged a vessel, ami I say further that the agents of the steamship companies told that thej* could not get their vessels discharged without bribing the officials. Mr. SUMNER. I should like to know whether these men are continued in office 1 Mr. PATTERSON. I have no knowledge of their ever having been removed. I know nothing about it. Mr. SCHURZ. The Senator (Mr. Morton) says that my remarks yesterday cast reflection on the Republican party. How so 1 Do wo not all profess to ho in fuvoj* of reform, and yet when a member of tills body attempts to h«y bare gross abuse, the cry is raised that ho is trying to injure the Republican party. My motives have beenrellectcdupon, and land those with whom l act have been asked what object we pur sue. lam ready to tel! the Senate. My object is to uncover and to denounce, and to try to have corrected any and every abuse wherever I can lav my hand upon it, without regard to how it will ‘affect the interests or advantages of a party, and without regard to whether this or that person may like it or not. lam In favor of reform, and lam in dead earnest. Ido not mean to denounce abuses on the other side, and to shield abuses among my own friends. I want to put the iron to the very bottom of the sore, and unless wo do that we do nothing. Mr. TIPTON followed in support of Mr. Trum bull’s proposition. He cited Mr. Mor ton's statement yesterday, that tho objects of those who befriended that proposition was to show that great corrup tion exists under tho present administration, and said that that was exactlv what he wished the people to understand. As to the otherhranch of Mr. Morton's charge, that this movement was an attack on tho Republican ’party it was not true. Ho (Tipton) made no attack on the Repub lican party. On the contrary, he doalrod to redeem that party from tho curse that had come upon it through tho mistakes of the administration and corruption of its officials. He believed that there was corruption, deep, damning and festering all through this ad ministration. The motives of those who sought to revive tho Committee on Retrenchment were called in question. Could not a man believe that evtn in tho Senate there might be found abetter leader for the Republican party than tho intellectual colussus now sitting In the v- f-White House ? Without being thcreiore accused of unfaithfulness to party, would it be said that there was only one man In the country under whom tho Republicans could train, and bo loyal. The Senator from Indiana (Mr. Morton) had boasted that it was a distin guishing mark of the Ropubllcan party that it was prompt to pnnish wrong-doers among its numbers. Ho (Tipton) bad once believed so, and hud acted upon that belief, but ho had been pro scribed and punished for itover since. Mr. Trumbull’s amendment was rejected by a vote of 24 yeas to 35 nays. Tho following Repub licans voted for it: Alcorn. Fenton, Logan, Pat terson, Robertson, Schurz, Sumner, Tipton, Trumbull, West and Wilson. Tho original resolution was then adopted. Mr. 

TRUMBULL then moved to Instruct the committee provided for In the resolution just adopted to inquire into all the subjects enumer ated in his rejected amendment, and made a few remarks. He denied that he had done or proposed or said anything hostile to tho admin istration or Republican party. Ho was astound ed at the ground taken by certain Senators in this debate. Ho was hostile to none who wore 1 not dishonest and corrupt, and would any Senator undertake to say that tho administration or party did not desire honesty in the government? Tho President had declared in favor of reform. Mr. 

MORTON said that the drift of the debate was a reflection upon tho Republican party, and an insinuation that it was corrupt. Mr. TRUMBULL. Have I ever said or intimat ed that? Mr. MORTON replied that from the spirit of the Senator’s remarks ho inferred that he (Mr. Trum bull) did believe that gross corruptions existed under the present administration,hut he was glad now to find that lie did not think so. Mr. 

TRUMBULL said lie believed that great abuses didexist under this administration—abused that had existed under airadmiuistxations, but he believed that the great increase in the amount of patronage had naturally caused an Increase in abuse also. Ho had not said, however, that more corruption existed under this than under the pre vious administration, but then he wished this ad ministration to be better than all its predecess ors, and the Republican party to bo purer than any other. Mr. MORTON. I am glad to near the Senator declare his devotion to the Republican party, but 1 did understand the spirit of his speeches to be different. However, I accept his statement of his position. Now, as to his question of reform, there seems a disposition on the part of some people in this country to become professional re formers par crccllcnce. They seem to de sire to monopolize that business, and to set themselves up as the only men who hate cor ruption. Now, 1 desire to say to these gentlemen, whoever they may bo, that for oho I shall not allow them to monopolize that business. I claim to be as good a reformer as any of tbcm, although I do not make such high pretensions. Mr. TRUMBULL said Mr. Morton was extreme ly kind to accept his statement, but he declined to answer to him (Mr. Morton) for his Republi canism, and denied his right to call him to an ac count. That Senator (Mr. Morton) claimed to bo a reformer, but bo bad a queer way of showing it. Notlong ago in a speech in St. Louis ho had eulogized the civil service as it stands at present. Mr. MORTON remarked that in that speech he had said of the civil service that while there were many reforms and improvements which could be made in it, and which the Republican party would make, he did believe that on the whole we had the best civil service in the world, and he <li<7 say the same now. Mr. TRUMBULL. Well, if (hero is anvwlmro in the world o worse civil service than that of the United States, I pray God to deliver that people from it. {Laughter - ] I feel less disposed than ever to submit my Republicanism to the test of the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Morton), after his declaration that we have the best civil service in the world. My Republicanism, is not partisan. I care nothing for it except as a party of groat principles, and if it ever comes to bo used as a cover for frauds and iniquities, the honest people of the country will overwhelm us as they ought to. ADJOURNMENT. At sp. ra. f without ranching a vote on Mr. Trumbull's motion, the Senate went into execu tive session, and soon after adjourned until Mon day. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. INFORMATION CALLED FOR. Mr. BURCHARD offered a resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for information as to the number of persons employed, aud the total compensation paid therefor in the collec tion of customs for tho fiscal year ending June so. 1871, in the United States, andseparately in tho Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Boston.

Dec. 14.—A letter from Alexandria Egypt, gives the details of the drowning of seven tv-five Algerian pilgrims. They had arrived In the outer harbor, on their way to Mecca, when protests from the Consuls against .their landing were made, on the ground that they would dis seminate tho cholera and other contagious dis eases. Orders were given to land them outside of the city, and they were taken from the steamer on a lighter, and. while being towed ashore, tho boat was struck by another lighter, cutting her to tho water’s edge. She sank immediately, carry ing nil down. Tho event caused particular sensation In Alexandria. The same letter says that tho entire East Is restless under tho cholera scourge. Alexandria, which is the great highway to and from India, threatens to disseminate tho cholera around tho glohe. Germany.

Ogden, Utah, Dec. 13—10:30 p. m.—Three men, respectively named Andrew Burt, Chief of Po lice, J. L. Blythe, and James Toms, wore ar rested to-day for the murder of Dr. J. K. Robin son, in the fall of 18CG. The circumstances of his murder are as follows : Dr. Robinson was called out of bis bed to visit a man who had broken his leg, which proved to be u false pretence in order to allure him onr, whereupon seven villains stole on him from behind and literally riddled his body with balls. Tbo doctor was a Gentile, universally respected by Mormons and Gentiles, and Super intendent of tbo Presbyterian Sabbath school here. The authorities are after the other assass ins, and entertain sanguine hopes of capturing them. Salt Lake, Dec. 14.—John Brcasure, the fourth man charged with being one of the murderers of Dr. Robinson, was arrested this morning. All four of the accused were brought before' Judge McKean this afternoon for examination. The testimony was startling. One of the witnesses testified to having seen the deed committed a short distance from the spot, and positively Identified Jno. L. Blythe and Jas. Toms as two of the murderers. The victim was first struck upon the head with a short sword, and In falling was shot under the left eye. Witness described the whole affair as be saw it from the shadow of a fence, the night being bright moonlight. The court room was densely crowded, and upon the identification of Blythe and Toms much excite ment was apparent. Tbe Wharton ITlnrdcr Trial. Annapolis, Dec. 14.—1n the Wharton case to day, Harry W. Snowder testified that ho was called to the house of Mrs. Wharton, Juno 28, to nurse Ketohum. Ho described the symptoms of the General, and then said that shortly after 12:30 o’clock Mrs. Wharton stated to Mrs. Hutton that she had prepared General Ketehum’a modl cino f andat Mrs. Wharton’s request witness ad ministered the dose. Dr. Williams was here called to the stand and prepared a dose of yellow jessamine, such as ho prescribed for General Ketchum. Witness resuming, stated that the medicine, as now prepared by Dr. Williams, did not have the same appearance asthe dose prepared by Mrs. Wharton and administered by him to Ketchum, which had a thick or cloudy lead-colored appear ance, whereas, the preparation now before him was clear and transparent. Forty additional drops were added to the iireparation, and it was still unlike that given to Ketchum. On cross exanimation, witness stated that ho had placed tartar emetic in the tumbler with the jessamine and . water, and it did not produce the color ho observed in tho[dose administered by him to Ketchum. Wit ness said that laudanum was also placed in the tumbler with the tartar emetic and jessamine, and that the mixture qiroducedfla brown color, which in some lights might have appeared gray or-leadcoior. Eugene Van Ness testified that ho resides in Baltimore. Has resided there eighteen years. Had known Mrs. Wharton nine years. Was at her house about the 21th of June, while General Keichum was there. Mr. Syester. Do not answer tho question lam about to ask you until you have heard from the Court. I wish you to state to tho Jury how you came to ho at Mrs. Wharton’s house on that day, and if well or sick, and describe your feelings and symptoms fully, and how you iiapponed to be taken sick there I The defence- objected, and lengthy argument ensued.

Springfield, Deo. 14. -This morning Mr. Greenehaum’s bill,in its amended form, was read tlio second time, and an attempt was made by Colonel Turner to have it sot as a special order for Tuesday. Tbo effort foiled, for Democratic votes prevented the suspension of the rules, and, as might have been expected, those who had been specially benefited, and specially inured, by the Apportionment bill, united in voting against this important measure. The opposition was led by Mr. Cummings, who, while stating that ho was not lighting the bill, yet objected to giving it the precedence over bills which ranked it on the calendar, and were of interest to the State at large, while this proposition was for the benefit of Chicago and of Gorman capitalists. That that which aided Chicago aided Fulton Connty, seemed to him an untruth. In view of this unwillingness to give this bill a preference, it is impossible to say when it will come up, the Revenue and other bills being yet undisposed of. DILL APPROVED. Tho Governor, to-day, signed Mr. Phelps’ bill empowering tbe United States to obtain land in Illinois. It did not remain in his possession ten minutes. Senator Woodard, in order to meet certain scru ples on the part of some members in regard to his bill to fix the price of re-recording in Cook Coun ty, has altered it somewhat, and mikes three classes, as follows; First-class is all under 20,000 ; second-class, over 20,000 and not exceed ing 70,000. viz.: Adams, Bureau, Cham paign, Christian, |Olcs, DeKalb, Ed gar, Fulton, Hancock. Henry, Iro quois, Jo Daviess. Kane, Kankakee, Knox, Lake, LaSalle, Leo, Livingston. Logan. Macon, Macoupin, Madison, Marion, McDonough, Mc- Henry, McLean, Montgomery, Morgan, Ogle, Peoria, Piko, Randolph, Rock island, Sangamon, Shelby, St. Clair, Stephenson, Tazewell, Vermil ion, Warren, Whiteaiue, Will, Winnebago. Third class, exceeding 70,000, viz., Cook. Tho rest of the bill is the same as Senate Bill 326, as hereto fore introduced by him—viz., 5 cents for record ing; no fee for indexing or filing; fine, S2OO fop each offence, receivable before Justices of the Peace. The bill now applies only to third class, as it Is provided that officers in other counties shall receive tho same fees as now provided by law until further legislation is bad. EMINENT DOMAIN. All the time of tho House was spent in listen ing to speeches on special benefits and special assessments, and no subject has been more thor oughly or more ably discussed in that body dur ing its existence. The attention given tho sub ject last May induced a more complete study of the principles involved, and tho speeches of this session have presented iho case for both sides iu better form than in the spring. So faras argu ments went, the supporters of Nelson’s hill had the advantage of its opponents, with hut ouoor two exceptions, resting the case very much on expediency, and claiming that cities could not do without special assessments and special bedefits, u view of the case which is held by a de cided majority of those who represent city con stituencies. Fho vote taken in Committee of tho Whole resulted In tho defeat of the amendment allowing cities to assess special benefits, and al lowing cities to make improvements by special taxation, and in the adoption of tho principle that benefits shall not bo assessed. These votes, however.'by no means indicate the passage of Nelson’s biff. They show that his side has gained since May, but there were but 135 members pres ent, and the result in a full House is yet uncer tain. These votes do indicate, however, that special benefits will not bo allowed to be assessed where railroads take lands, and also that tho opposing parties arc so nearly matched that it is very likely that no bill will bo passed on tbe subject; but there seems to bo no change of opinion in tho Senate, where the prin ciple of assessing benefits has been affirmed by a great majority, and since tho necessity for tho same law is felt, and the Senate is very much for special benefits and the House closely divided, there is apt to bo a yielding by the weakest party, and some members of tho House, while believing tbo assessing of benefits to be wrong, may vote for the bill allowing them, and take the chance of tho Supreme Court upsetting the bill, which is not unlikely, rather than have no hill at all. Cook County is split, as -usual. Phelps, Sullivan, Morrison, Vooko and Heafieid are against special assessment and benefits, while all—or nearly all—the remainder ravor them. Some think them right in theory; some think they work well in practice; and others have paid special assessments, and do not now want to pay to Improve other people’s jiropcrty. THE MAYOR’S RILL was the special order for this morning, but was crowded out, and it is impossible to say when it will come up again. HOLIDAY ADJOURNMENT. are now beginning to look forward to an adjournment for the holidays, and they will probably do so to-morrow, for a week or ten days. HATE OF TAXATION IN CHICAGO. Senator Doro, to*duy, ottered a bill, to which the attention of tbo citizens of Chicago is specially invited, since it practically limits the rate of taxation in that city. Before the bill comes up fordiscussion there will probably bo expressions of opinion from Chicago as to whether the limit is too high or too low. The bill provides that cities having a population of more than one hundred thousand shall not, in any one year, levy taxes in the aggregate for all purposes ex clusive of taxes for special improvements exceed ing 3 per cent, or the value of the taxable prop erty within such cities fixed by the last preceding assessment for State taxation. KAVAOATION OF THE ILLINOIS RIVER. Mr. Eddy offered in the Senate, to-day, an ex ceedingly important resolution in relation to im provingibc navigation in the Illinois River by utilizing the waters of tbo chain of lakes at tbo bead waters of tbo Fox and Dcsplalnes Bives, and instructing the Canal Commissioners to get information on the subject Mr. Eddy is not mis taken. The Illinois can be improved better and cheaper by tills agency than by tbo construction of a number of dams across the stream. INCORPORATION BILL. Tbe Senate kept on with the bill for incorporat ing cities, and, after a long debate and many at tempted amendments, ordered it to a third read ing in about the shape in which It was yesterday, giving newer to remove all officers appointed by the Moj-or without the action of the Council, and including Woodard’s amendment for using a minority vote in electing Aldermen. FEE BILL, Mr. Bangs reported a bill fixing the fees of Jus tices of tlie Peace, and that about winds up that subject, so for us the Senate Committee Is con cerned. LEGISLATIVE. SENATE.

Mr. ED3ALL reported hack the Incorporation bill, with various amendments of no .particular importance, except a proviso regarding the elec tion of Aldermen. The amendment provides that one-half of tho Aldermen be elected by wards,the remainder on a general ticket. Mr. WOODARD opposed the amendment, which destroyed the true theory that odlccra were elected to represent tho city and not tho UNDERWOOD argnedthat the amendment was good, and cited the fact that, by a combina tion of only two wards in East St. Louis, iu build ing dykes, chat city had been rendered “ almost hopelessly insolvent.” • Mr. WASHBURN did not believe in the princi ple that the aggregated wisdom of the whole body was superior to that of a body in Its indi vidual capacity. Mr. LANGLEY supported the amendment on general principles, and especially os tending to cstroy ward bummerism. Mr. fIOLCOMB opposed for tho reason that It would tend to enhance party spirit and bitter ness. Mr. CRAWFORD deprecated tho spirit in which tills matter had been received. Ho was certain that the day would come when tho idea would bo adopted. Mr. DORE opposed it because he was confident that something better was coming, viz; two legislative bodies in cities like Chicago. Tho amendment was lost—yeas, 23; nays. 14. Mr. WILLIAMS moved to amend by increasing the term for which private corporations may con struct water works, from twenty to thirty years. Adopted. Mr. STARNE moved to amend by striking out the provision empowering city councils to regu late tho location, management, etc., of breweries, livery stables, blacksmith shops, and foundries. Lost— yeas, 15 ; nays, 25. JUDICIAL. In the afternoon Mr. 8 ENTER called up Senate hill 310, to dotuch Mercer County from tho Tenth The House •went Into Committee of the Whole on the Bouse Eminent Domain bill, the ponding question being Mr. Kerrick's amendment to Mr. Springer’s amendment to the first section of the bill, which amendment authorized juries to assess benefits where public improvements were made by a municipality. Mr. CAREY opposed tbo amendment and sup ported the bill os it was, believing that when a man’s property was taken ho shall bo fully paid for It. If cities would grow only at the expense of Individual rights they had better stop growing, Iffr. MOFFITT, of Macon, spike against the principles of Mr. Adams’ bill, and he believed where a man’s road was helped by a railroad he should pay to get improvements In cities. They must have special benefits. If they did not, then they had none at all, or carried the thing to ex tremes, and made too many. Message from the Governor announcing he had signed the bill authorizing the United States to obtain lands for sundry purposes. Mr. BURLEY spoke in favor of tbo principle of special benefits. Ho was prepared to support Mr.-Kerrick’s amendment, which allowed special benefits where a thing was done by public corpor ations. Mr. ROOT followed on the same side as Mr. Burley. Ho was opposed to attacking the princi ple ho defended, because it had been unjustly ad ministered in special cases. To make improve ments by general tax was to turn backward. Mr. RYAN followed in a strong speech in sup port of Mr. Nelson’s bill and in opposition to spe cial benefits. The committee rose. AFTERNOON SESSION. ESTKAVB. The House went into Committee of the Whole on the bill to prevent stock animals from running at large. Mr. DODGE spoke in favor ol the bill, the prin ciple of which was favored by a great majority or the counties in the State. Counties not desir ing the law may by vote relievo themselves from its operation. Mr. MOFFITT spoke In favor of the bill, quot ing figures to show its importance to the people. The cost of fencing in Improved lands in Illinois was about sixty-eight millions. The value of stock bv the last assessment was about six and a half millions. Fencing the ground necessary to pasture stock would cost twenty millions only, being a saving of over forty millions. An amendment was adopted allowing 160 people to call an election to get rid of the law. The committee reported back the bill with the recommendation that it pass. The amendments were adox)ted,and it was ordered to a third read ing. was again taken up. Mr. SPRINGER said ho preferred Mr. Kerrick’s amendment to bis own, and, since it covers the whole question, ho accepted it. He objected to Mr. Short’s proposi tion, since it was turning over legislative power to the courts, and favored the granting to munic ipalities power to make special assessments. To pass Mr. Nelson’s bill was to repeat the Park bills, drainage bill, and all tbo decisions of the Supreme Court. Mr. PHELPS followed in support of the House bill, explaining the manner in which the system of making special assessments had been carried on in Chicago, and calling attention to the fact that persons assessed baa never any guarantee that tbo benefits would continue, and no provis ion for payment of special injuries. RMr. Kerrick’s amendment was lest—yeas, 67; nays, CD. FEES. Mr. DIXON spoke in support of tlie principle of special assessments in Chicago.

The section was adopted—yeas, 74; nays, 63. , Mr. DIXON moved to proceed to the considera tion of the Senate bill. Mr. SANFORD opposed the motion, since the committee had deemed in favor of tho principle of the House bill. Mr. Dixon’s motion was lost. __ , The second section of tho House bill was adopted.

Mr. EDDY offered the following resolution; Whereas, The chain of lakes extending from the Fox to the Desplainea River in the north pars of this State may. by the construction of dams, ho converted into reservoirs for holding in reserve the surplus waters of those rivers; and Whereas, It is the opinion of many who hare in vestigated the subject that such surplus of waters, if used when needed, would so Improve the navigation of the Illinois River ns to greatly cheapen.il not entirely avoid, the necessity of building tho proposed locks and dnms on said nver, thereby saving large sums of money to the State Treasury: therefore. Me ft resolved, by the Senate, tho House of Itepro sentatives concurring, that tho Canal Commissioners be instructed to collect such data as may be within their command, and cause their engineer to make ex amination and preliminary survey of sai4 lakes and surrounding marshes, to report the result of snob in vestigation, with an estimate of tho cost of such im provement, to tho General Assembly at as early a day as practicable, and made the special order for to-mor row, at 10:15 a. m.

Arrival of the Captain at New York— Spanish Insolence and Crime. From the New York World, Dec. 32. Captain F. W. Walsman, of the steamer Hornet, which has for several months been blockaded in the harbor of Port an Prince by Spanish gunboats, has arrived in this city, and been interviewed in regard to tho Hor net. The Captain is a German by birth, and ia about 35 years of age. While the Hornet was lying at the harbor of Port au Prince, Captain walsman spates that he was ap proached by the Chief Engineer of the Span ish gunboat Isabella Catholica, who offered him from SIO,OOO to $25,000 if he would sink, burn, or blow up the Hornet. This proposi tion was indignantlyrejectedby the Captain, and tho vessel remained for months under tho watchful eyes of several Spanish gun boats. In response to Mr. Bassett's application the United States war steamer Swatara, Captain Allen in command, arrived on the 21st of September and anchored some dis tance outside the harbor. Captain Wala man, immediately on the arrival of the Swatara. called on Captain Allen, and to gether they repaired to the United States Minister, where Captain Allen overhauled all the Hornet's papers, and found them all correct and regular. Captain Walsman then ashed Captain Allen what he thought of the Hornet going to sea, and what protection ho would receive. He was told that he had better wait awhile, as there was plenty of time. “But,” said Captain Walsman, “had n't I better get iu my coal and be ready, as it would take about forty-eight hours to do sof” Ho was then again told to wait until instructions were receivedfrom Washington. As that had been the plea on which the Hor net bad been detained in port for several months. Captain Walsman, as the chief ofiicer of an American trading vessel threat ened with violence by a foreign man-of-war in neutral waters, made a formal demand of Captain Allen for protection, which was re fused until orders were received from Wash ington. The Captain states that a trial trip was made; that the Hornet steamed out five miles and made good time. No efforts to de ter the Hornet were made by the Spanish gunboats, and bad there been sufficient coal on board, the Captain states that the Hornet would not have returned, bat would have at tempted to escape. The day after the Hornet had made her trial trip the Swatara left Port an Prince, but the United States steamer Nantasket was hourly expected in port. Shortly after this the Spaniards took occa sion to make outrageous demands on the Haytien Government. The Captain of the Churuca, through the Spanish Consul, de manded of the Haytien officials of the port that the Hornet should bo delivered up to him within thirty-four hours or he would take her by force. They also demanded of the Haytieus $120,000 in gold as an in demnity for the coal and other expenses incurred while watching the Hornet. These demands were indignantly spurned by Gen eral Lorqnet, who, in the absence of Presi dent Saget, then at Anx Caves, was presid ing over the government of Hayti. General Lorqnet immediately placed fifty soldiers on Fort Island, a battery of guns on shore. He was himself out on horseback all night, ready to prevent the threatened seiz ure of the Hornet. He also despatched a special messenger to Grand Gnave with in telligence of the Spanish demands to Presi dent Saget, and although the distance was about fifty miles, the messenger returned within twenty-four hours with, the Presi dent's reply, “Don’t give up the Hornet un der any circumstances.” Mr. Bassett also acted promptly, and demanded the active protection of the government for an Ameri can vessel. A meeting of the foreign Minis ters in Port an Prmco was held, and they highly approved the course taken by General Lorqnet. In spite of the demands and threats made by the Spaniards, they made no attempt to seize tUo Hornet. On the Bth of November the Spanish Consul came to Captain Wals man and told him that he thought he coaid buy tbe Hornet for about SOO,OOO, and that be would give him (Captain Walsman) half the amount if ho would aid him in the purchase, and would also give SI,OOO for the crew. This, as previous attempts at bribery, was indignantly rejected by the Captain, who shortly after, finding,there was little no chance of getting the Hornet away at pres ent, left lor New York in the bark Trail d'Union on the 16th of November, arriving there on the 4th inst. When he left the Spanish war steamers Saragossa and Pizarro were daily expected at Port au Prince, and have since arrived there.

Desjarten, a car driver; and seizing an oar to aid them, they rushed onto the ice, and made their uncertain way rapidly toward the place whence the soaadj seemed to come, and after going some 300 or 400 yards— Coleman falling through the ice once on his way, but luckily striking on a sand-bar. ha went in waist deep—they came to a man struggling with desperate force to raise himself out of the water onto the ice, but his overcoat had become so heavy from soaking that to lift himself out was impossi ble. They ran the oar out to him, and with this assistance he was enabled to draw him self out, and was then immediately assisted to the Julian House, where he was attended with the most faultless promptitude, as are all gentlemen who go there, no matter in what plight. The rescued proved to bo Moses M. Strong, of Mineral Point, one of the most able jurists that ever the State of Wisconsin could lay claim to. Mr. Strong had attended the railroad meeting at Hazel Green Satur day evenmg, and came west with the Dubuque delegation as far as Dunleith, and then concluded to wait tbere, and take the evening express across the river, but afterward changed his mind, and being assured there was a clear track across the river, he attempted it, but having proceeded to within about 350 yards of the Dubuque shore, ho seems to havo walked di rectly into an air-hole. In his struggles in the river he lost his carpet-sack which, w© understand, contained a largo sum of money, and for the recovery of which ho offers SIOO reward. Of the little ho had with him he gave his rescuers $lO each. His principal object in coming across the river in advance of the train was to secure a sleeping-car. as he wanted to go East that night. The mis hap obliged him to change his plan, and ho remained here and took the noon tram on Monday. —President Theirs recently bad it brought to his notice that an American, Dr. Charles B. Brig ham, a Harvard graduate, had achieved a won derful operation on a French soldier, and there for© invited the surgeon and his patient to visit the Executive Mansion. The operation consisted in replacing the face of a soldier found on the battlefield. A complete face has been substi tuted—even to teeth and eyes.
