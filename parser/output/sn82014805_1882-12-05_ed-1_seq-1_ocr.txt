At 8 o'clock yesterday afternoon William Ellloger's cross-exam'nation was returned, hut nothing of material Interest was de veloped. Charles K. Gano, affirmed, stated that he was In the same building as James A. Sanders, to whom he sold groceries, spices, etc.; there was an account between witness and James A. Bunders, which was settled «nice a month, cash being paid wheu a balance was due from either a.da ; all trans actions w but later on hills came lu the names of E. B. and Henry L. Banders. When cross examined witness testified that once he saw a salesman offer to sell goods to James A. Sanders, but was told by rhat gentleman "I have nothing to do with Henry W. Morrow, sworn—Stated that in 1880 he published a small paper called the Evening Programme for distribution In the Opera House. Thu «tore occupied by the Zanders was advertised iu the usine ot •Sanders," all contracts and pay mente heilig made by James A. Bandera. Oeea -ionaiiy advertisements were put in to till up with wheu in a hurry, without beiuj* or-lered. On cross-examination witness could not tell whither all of the seven advertisement* of Banders were puid for or not; three he was certain of. The seven copies ot the Programme were off« etl In evidence. Mr. Lore called upon the opposite side for a patx-r offered in evidence by Mr Nields. It was a letter dated Jan. 8, 1879, trenn Hood, Bonhrigbt A Co., to E. Bertha Sanders. Mr. Nields said that at the time theletters wus offered and then withdrawn, it was dou« *o because there was an error in the date ol 'he letter, which should have been Januar) 8, 1880. E. Bertha Baud' 1 » was to have oeen called to prove this fact, but haviug a •mall child was uot held in the Court. Alter a close search among his papars Mr. ipruunce found the letter. Mr. Lore offered in evidence the record ol three judgments of other credilorsof James A. Banders, outside of the four execution creditors. The court ruled that the records were in ul mlt-sable and Mr. Lore uoted au excep tion. Mr. Lore stated that his aide was through • li«l was willing to submit the quation to he Jury without argument. Messrs. Nicldt and 8pruance objected After considerable talk as to how long tin lawyers should speak in the way ol argu ■Urtit, It was decided to go on and see wh.i could be doi e. Accordingly a 4 80 Mr. Nields opened for the plaiuiUf. He said the case was not who was the manager of the store, hut who was the owuer of the goods sold. The lawy« rs on the other side would cry fraud, fraud fraud, until the sound of It could uot leave iho court room for nine months. Alter tell ing an anecdote ot a coon hunter shootiug at an Imaginary coon aud wasting all his ammunition, the geutlctnau started out lu tils argument proper. THIS MORNING'S SESSION.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. AGENERALLY SATISFACTORY DOCUMENT. HD COMFORT FOR STALWARTS. A Redaction of Taxation l(ec< A General Revit a Personal Apology. intended— of Pnbllo Affairs and Wasfihoton, Dec. 4.—President Arthur sent hia second annual message to Congress to day. He rtret calls attention to our for eign relations, which continue to be of the most friendly character. Such slight differ ences as bave arisen during the year have be n already settled or are likely to reach an early adju tmei.t. TUB 

FI3TAKO 8. The President copies the figures sub mitted by th« Secretary of ibe Treasury in his report, agrees with the Secretary that it is not desirable to continue the coinage of the «liver dollar, now ao enormously in excess of the demand, and continues : **I heurtily approve the Secretary's recommcn datioii ol immediate and extensive reduc tions In the ment. Ills one of the tritefrt maxims ol political economy that all taxes are burdeu B(>me. Of late the public revenues have far •»acceded this limit, aud unless ch eked by appropriate legislation such excess will con tinue to increase from year to yrur. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the hundred mil uul revenues of the goveri - ulus revenue »mounted to ■ inns of dollars; for the fiscal year ended the : last the surplus wi a more than one hundred and forty-five mil ions. The report of the Secretary shows what disposition has been made of these moiu ys. They have not only answered the « cqu ire incuts of the stoking fund, but have atlorded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the publie d«'bt. But 1 renew the expression of mv conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the public indebt edm-HS as is now taking place is by no means a cause tor congratulation. It is a cause rather for serious apprehension. If it con tinues iUtnusi he speedily followed by one of the evil results so clearly set forth in the report, of the Secretary. Either the surpl must lie Idle in the Treasury or the Uovcru •nt will be fore d to buy at market rates in hoiids not then redeemable, and which under such circumstances* cannot fuit to command an enormous premium, or the leu revenues will be devoted to extiava gant expenditure, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of au ovefflowiug Treasury, !')tk of J 

IXEEKXAL REVENUE REDUCTION. "Upan the showing of our financial condi I leit juhti to Congress the aboli-, *uu# taxes except those upon tobiiced in its various toima and upon distilled spiti>s und iermented liquors and wine, except aho the special tax upon tin nu factures of all liquors in such article*, venture, now to t-uug» at that unless it sha 1 ■ctaiuud H at the probable expendi . uii s ot the government 'or the coming y« at nave beeu uuderestiniuted.ull internal tuxes, those which relate to distilled spirits, uu be pruriently abrogated. Bueh a course, if accompanied by a simplification ol • he machinery of collection, which would theii bo easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to result in diminishing the cost of such collection by at leust two millions and a half of dollar.*, aud iu the retirent nt from office of from 1,500 to 2,090 persons. The system of ex cise duties has never commended itself to the favor of the American people, aud hap never been resorted to except for supplying deficiencies in »ne Treasury when, by reason of special exigencies, the duties on import Inivepioved inadequate lor the need ol th« government.

TARIFF REVISION. The President next discusses the tariff. The present system, he says, is in many re spects unjust. It makes uuequal distribu tion by reason oflts burdens and its benefits If the tax oti domestic spirits is to be re tuitied it is plain, that large reductions from 1 he customs revet Wlule recommending this reduction, 1 am lur front advising the abandonment, of th« policy of so discriminating in the adjustment «d duties s to afford aid and prolecliou t< domestic labor. But the pret>eut syutem should be so revised a* to equalize the put» He bin nen among all classes und « »ecu path »L« and bring it into closer harmony w ith U.t :ed of industry. Without enter ing into minute dctuils, which uudei present circumstances is quite uuuecessary, 1 recommend uu enlargement of tin free list s » as to include w ithin it the numer ous articles which yield iuconsiderabl« revenue; an amplification ol the complex and inconsistent, schedule of dutiea upon certain inaiiuiactums, partieuluily those ol cotton, it on aud steel, and a substantial re duction of the duties upon those articles, upon sugar, molasses, silk, wool amt woolen goods. If a g iicrul revision of the tariff shall be found to be impracticable at this session I express the hope that at least Mime ot the more conspicuous iurqu lilies of the present law may be cot reeled befbr» your final adjournment. One of them it specially refer red to by the Secretary.

CIVIÏ. SERVICE REFORM. On civil service reform he baa this to say : Tbs communication which I made to Cob* press at Its first session In December last contained a aopewhat full statement of my sentiments In relation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to public service. Referring to the varh ta plans which hud, thcivfo-e, been the sub ject of diM-Uftsfon in the National Legisla ture, "plans which In the main were modeled upon the system which obtains in Great Britain, but wbfen lacked certain of the prominent features whereby that system Is distinguished, I felt bound to in timate my doubt whether they qr any of them would afford adequate remedy for the evils which they aimed to correct. 1 declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measurer -liou'd prove acceptable to Congrefes, they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive. Since these suggestions were submitted for your consideration there has been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there has meanwhile •*een an increase in the public interest In that subject, and the people of the country, apparently without diorim-iion ot party, have In various ways and upon frequent oc casions given expression to their earnesf wish for prompt and dt Unite action. In my judgment, such action should no longer be postponed. ot I on an m us ol AN ArOLOOY. Wl lie neither that bill nor any othe* prominent scheme tor improving the civil service concerns the higher grade of officitth who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Benate, I leel bound to correct a prevalent Misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present Exec utive has displaced the incumbent ol an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeatedly alleged tnut he bus In thlj i articular sigi aily departed from the course» which has been pursued under receot administrations ot the government. The facts arc as loi lows: The whole n mber ol Executive appointments during the four years immediately preceding Mr. Gat field's accession to the. Presidency was 9,696. Of this number 214, or nine per cent. Involved the removal of previous ineumbeuts. The ratio ot removals to the whole number of appointments was much the same during • acli of those four years. In the first year, with 790 appointments, there were 74 re movais, or 9.3 percent.; in the second, with 917 appointments, there wete 85 removals, or 8.5*per cent.; iu the third, with 480 a|s poiiituicnts, there were 48 removals, or 10 per cent.; in the fourth, with 429 appoint ments, there were 37 removals, oi 8 6 per ci lit Iiflhe four mouths ol President Gar field's adiuiniktiuiioii the e were 390 ap poiiiiru« nth and 89 removals, or 22.7 pci '•lit. Precisely the same number ol re moval* (89) has taken place iu the fourteen hs winch have rince elapsed, hut llic) constitute only 7.8 per cent, of trie whole number of ai 'point mems (11.8) within that period and 1 ss than 2.0 |»er cent, of the en tire list of officials <3.469) exclusive of the army and navy, which urp flilid. by Presi dential appointments. 

POLITICAL ASSESSMENT«. i*f p> he a m* the • I declare my approval of such legislation as may be found necessary for supplement ing the existing provisions of law in rela tion to political assessments. In July Iasi l authorized a public announcement tha' employes of the government should regaid themselves as at. liberty to exercise Uiei. pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions and that »heir action ui that regard would in no manner affect I heir official status. In this announce ment I acted ujMin the view which 1 had always maintained and still main tain that a public officer should be us abso'ut* ly fret as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It ha*, however, been urged, and doubtless not without foundation in fact, that by solicita t on of superiors und 1 y « t'n r n o e- such -oiitribuMons have at times been obtained nom persons whose only motive for giviuc bien the fear of what might befall them «I they refused. It goes without haying hut such contribut'oiis are not voluntary, »ml in my judgment their collection should b prohibited by law. A bill which will ffVctually suppress them will receive inj •««dial approval. In conclusion the President refers to th« DLtiict of Columli a, recommends pr«>vi»h n or ascertaining (he Presidential vote uiiw for the Presidential succession and closer with an nckiiowhdgment. of the national blessings and the hope il.ar., ,4 uuder ti e i - - ni ratio!» of this great pr« »t parity, our louu * ils may be hurmouiou* a d t hat the dic tates of prudence, patriot sin, justice aid •coiiomy uiuy lead to the adoption of meu «•ares in which the Congress uud the Execu tive may heartily unite." t« Lo ne the at A

TRICKS ON TRAVELERS. PAVING' FOR LODGING BUT NOT GETTING IT. OUE GLASS OF FRONT STREET BUM \ An Old Peddler and His Wife Seek Ae oommodatlona at a- «•Hotel," Bat * r—* in Ui« city Ball. For some time past complaint« haft beea made by strangers who have entered Front struct "hotels" and lodging bouse«, that they have been badly treated aud in mapy instance« drugged aud robbed. The Gazktte some time tiuce spoke In « general way ol the condition of Front street in a moral sense and referred to the powerful liqiud dispensed to the unwary. Those fami liar with the locality seem to withstand the effects of the stuff called whisky and flourish on It. A new way to fleece the unsuspecting has come to light, although suopccied for some time and alto gether unknown. A bcua fide Instance ot the way the lodging house keepers make money without giving un equivalent is idiowu by the manner an aged couple were treated last night. An old peddler and his wife arrived in this city yesterday afternoon I rum West Chester lor the puiq»ose of re plenishing their stock, a regular thing for them to do. They are well known iu this ior the city, making fnqueot visiu iic same purpose. Upou gettiug through with tlieir busiui ta they entered Dugau'a saloon on Front street to engage lodging. The asked cost for himself and wile, toid by Dugan that 50 ceuta was the regu lar rate, Whereupon the customer remarked that la-retold e a hen be had stopped at the same place under another proprietor be hod only paid 80 cent« lor the two. then told by t he proprietor that the beds were good and 50 cents was the lowest price. The peddler agreed and his wife stepped into the room bock of the bar and sat down. The old gentleman then, being cold and chilled through with bis long walk, called lor two giusëcs of whisky, drinking one himsell aud Mrs Dugau carry, mg tl«e Oilier to his wile. He then puid Dug. n 70 cents, 50 lor the Led and 20 for tue liquor. Alter that lie says he tiers nothing until fbuud on the sidewalk by an officer aud takeu to the Hall. The rest ol his story is told by the police officers. Shortly after 8 o'clock officer Heal louud the old man in front ot Dugan's place m u stupid condition, his bundle of goods being scattered around. Knowing the old fellow the officer kindly picked up the dif ferent articles und tied them together just us Dugau came out. Heal spoke to Dugan aud asked him to take care of the old man, not knowing the latter had been iuside once. — Dugau agreed to do to, while the o d lady, who did not appear to be under the influence ol the diu_ r , wus advised logo to the hail. The old old what it would and was man He was rrmrtn went in, but. in the course i*f >5 or 2U miiiuus when « fli» er» Cannon itid Vickers came along there waa the old p> ddier asleep on the sidewalk, t.ikeu to the Hall and this cuoruiug told his story. ilc declares that the'story as Iiere told is true in every particular so far as he can recollect up to the time ot payiugtbe money lor his bed and gettiug the liquor. Further he 6tales that he had not taken a drink of any kind prior to the decoction or concoction furnished by Dugan. The old fellow does not. appear at all like a drinking man aud feel» keenly the unfair and dishonorable treatment to which he was subjected. The officers treated him kindly aud no charge will be preferred against him. Ou the other baud it Is asserted that Dugan will be arraigned for obtuiuiug me> under false pre Lenses. Both Dugau uud his wife offer excuse for ousliug the «»Id folks, to neithi r of which, however, will hold good, inasmuch as they never saw the bed paid lor, let alone getting iuu> it. Such tricks upon travelers arc altogether too frequent upon the much complained of thoroughfare, anJ some stringent measures needed to break up the disreputable practices. Mayor Wales has, upon several occasions, publicly reprimanded Dugau lor the style .nid manner iu which that worthy V cMablisl- m* nt is conducted, and promhes that if the proprietor ol the Front street dive cornea "elore him aud is fourni guilty lo d»-gj out • II the penalty that the law allows aud pre Sw*nte.
