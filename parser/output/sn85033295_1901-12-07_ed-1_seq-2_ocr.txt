In the absence of definite informa tion the cause assigned for the riot in Athens, in which 20,000 persons took part and a nmber were killed end wounded, is surprising. It is said to have been a proposal to translate the Gospels into modern Greek. As the entire New Testament, including the Gospels, was written and printed in Greek at a very early period it must be that the proposed transla tion into modern Greek is regarded by the officials of the Greek church es profanation. It seems slight cause for the terrible slaughter.

In 1890, according to the bulletin, the average age at which Americans died was 31.1 years; in 1900 the average lifetime was 35.4, a gain of 4.3 years. This statement might be questioned were it not for the fact that it is simply corroborative of the results reached by life insurance mathema ticians, who are without question the most experienced and skillful experts.

HIS ANNUAL MESSAGE Synopsis of the President’s Rec ommendations to Congress. He Touches Upon Many Important Question* Among Them Trusts, Irrigation Works, Isthmian Canal and Other Things, The following is a brief synopsis of President Roosevelt’s message to con gress, giving a resume of his comments and recommendations upon the topics of greatest interest to the American people: The message opens with an official no tice of the death of the late President McKinley, and a eulogy of him in which the president says; “It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley’s death he was the most widely-lcved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter ani mosities incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lof’y integrity in public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which are all important in the makeup of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer cised for political ends inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged.” In the same connection ho recommends legislation for dealing with anarchy, recommending a law that will permit the federal courts to handle any man guilty of taking or attempting to take the life of the chief magistrate or any person in the line ot succession to the presidency. Another is for a law that will prevent the preaching or teaching of anarchistic doctrines within our boundaries, and another is for one that will prevent the landing upon our shores of any person with anarchistic tenden cies. The Trust*. He deals with the trust probleo at con siderable length, citing both the advan tages and disadvantages of these great corporations to the nation. He does not attribute their rise to the existence of a protective tariff, but to natural causes that operate in other countries as well as our own. He claims that to them the nation owes much of its present degree of prosperity and commercial and industrial advance ment; that it is the great corporations who have driven the railroads across the continent, arid made us a world power in the markets of the world. He asks for legislation that will control and regulate them, but at the same time counsels congress to act with caution in enacting such legislation, and 1 assigns a number of reasons for the necessity for caution, and ,of this problem he says: “The process has aroused much antago nism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never be fore has the average man, the wage worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet it remains true that a for tune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the person spe cially benefited only on condition of con ferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise of the type which benefits all mankind can only ex ist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success." “Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and Tull and accurate information as to their •operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable Intervals.” Among his reasons for caution he em phasizes the fact that in whatever legis lation is enacted it should not, any fur ther than can be avoided, hamper the strung and forceful men upon whom the success of business operations Inevitably rests. Another of his reasons for caution is to be found In the international commercial conditions of to-day as the same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent fac tors In international commercial compe tition. As we have only just begyjn to as sume that commanding position in the In ternational business world which we be lieve will be more and' more ours, it is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeopardized at the present time. "Under such conditions It would be most unwise to cramp or fetter the youthful strength of the nation.” But while he recognizes these conditions as reasons for caution in enacting trust legislation, he believes there are evils which need be remedied, and believes, also, that remedies may be applied which will not hamper our present position. Of the evils he considers overcapital ization the worst, and of the remedy for these evils he says; “The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts— publicity. In the interest of the public the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in inter state business. Publicity is the only sure r emedy which we can now invoke. What, further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process cf law anil in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete —knowledge which may he made public to the world. "The large corporations. cofnmonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity In the state laws about them, and as no state has any exclusive Interest in or power over their acts it has in practice proved im-.. possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore in the Interest of the whole people the nation should, without interfering with the pow er of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an inter state business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in Us business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to it. and in their ease it is now accepted as a-simple matter of course. Indeed it is probable that supervision of corpora tions by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts in order to produce excellent results.” The president believes that it will be possible to secure the needed remedies for the trust evil under tho constitution as it now exists, but if congress thinks otherwise he recommends Itiat a constitu tional amendment be subm tied tnat will cot fer the po.ve’ necessary. In connection with the i>-usts hs rec ommends legislation creating a cabinet of ficer. to he known as secretary of a ni ne.ce, whose di ties would be to deal with all nn scions concern’; g commerce, later and the merchant marine, Chinese Exclusion Necessary. He recommends the immediate reen actment of the Chinese exclusion act as a necessary protection for American work men. and in the same connection recom mends such amendments to the interstate commerce law as will enable the various states to protect their laborers from the competition of prison labor of another state, and also that the government aid the movement for the bettering of the workingmen’s condition by not permitting women or children to work excessive hours or pt night upon goods made for government use. He asks for amendments to the immi gration laws that will prevent the land ing of undesirable immigrants, and such as will enable the immigrant officials to apply severer tests both mentally, moral ly and physically to those who seel: a landing upon our shores. Tbe Tariff. He counsels against any change in the present tariff laws, but urges the adop tion of the reciprocity idea as a means of opening the doors of the world to our commerce. In this connection he says •‘Every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economic legislation. “Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hearty sup port. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy In dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex atious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run directly or indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as pos sible be secured by so arranging cur tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit tO U 9. “The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with -those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. “I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor.” The Merchant Marine. The president pronounces our merchant marine “discreditable to us as a nation and insignificant to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business,” and says we “should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling por tion of our great commerce is carried In cur own ships. Of this he says: “To remedy this stale of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping in terests, but it would also result in beneflt to all who are interested in the perma nent establishment of a wider market for American products and would provide an auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping lines, if established to the principal coun tries with which we have dealings, wou'd be of political as well as commercial ben eflt. From every standpoint it is unwise for the United States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribution of oin goods. It should, be made advantageous to carry American goods In American built ships.” He also urges the enactment of such financial legislation as will better safe guard against the deranging influences of commercial crises and financial panics, and such as wiJI make the currency of the country more responsive to the demands of domestic trade and commerce. He points out the fact that the receipts from duties on exports and internal taxes far exceed the government’s expenditures, but counsels against a reduction that will cause a deficit, and in the same connection urges a strict economy in expenditures so far as our national needs will permit. Interstate Commerce. He comments upon the complaints en tered against the management of the rail ways for their alleged discrimination in the matter of freight rates against the small shippers and certain localities, and says: "The act should be amended. The rail way Is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation whiqh would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies.” He points to the fact that in the past “the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally oppos ing In dealing with business interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far-reaching na tional disaster that it would be prefer able to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is prac ticable to apply remedies.” In-ig tion. A considerable portion of the message is given to the subject of irrigation lor the aridlandsof the west, and he urgesgovern ment assistance in perfecting a system of irrigation that will reclaim these waste lands and make them habitable for set tlers. He believes the government should virtually control the water rights of the streams affording the water for irrigation purposes, and should construct reservoirs for this purpose. Of this he says: "The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow. The Colonies. He advocates reciprocal trade relations for Cuba that will afford that island a market for her products, and urges this on the grounds of morality and national interest. For the Philippines he recommends much in the way of legislation, but again counsels caution in the enactment of it. He says we cannot leave the islands at the present time, but that it is our duty to give to the Filipinos such an administra tion as will fit them for self-government in the future. He desires such legisla tion as will permit of the granting of franchises in the islands and so develop the natural resources of the group, and says of this necessity for development: “Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper ex ploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop It must be given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor in the development of every region over which our flag has flown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free play to industrial enterprise, and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them.” He also urges the immediate construc tion of a Pacific cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines with this country as a commercial, political and military ne cessity. The Isthmian Canal, He comments upon the necessity for the immediate construction of an isth mian waterway, and says the way has been prepared for its construction by the conclusion of anew treaty with England on the subject. Of the new treaty recently concluded with England he says: “I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotia tions on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and re spect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time and which guarantees to this nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton- Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in adequate to supply the base for the con struction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe cially provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate Its neutral use by all nations on terms' of equality without the guarantee or interference of anv outside nation from any quar ter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the senate, and if ap proved the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the canal.” The Army and Navy. For the navy he recommends a con tinued increase in ships as in keeping with our place as a first class power among the nations of the world. He also recommends an increase in the officers and men of the navy, that the ships now building may be placed in commission as soon as completed, without retiring any of the old ones. He urges this as a. means of performing our International duties as well as- a safeguard for our in ternational rights. He believes that all of our ships should be kept in commission as a means of training officers and men for times of emergency. Of the army he says there is- no need of an increase, but recommends the es tablishment of a staff department and a system by which there may be an elim ination, grade by grade, of those who seem unfit to render efficient service in the next grade. He also recommends the reduction of the “paper work” of the army, known commonly as army “red tape.” and espe cially for the army in the field. In the same connection he recommends the adop tion of new militia laws which will rec ognize the national guard of the several states and place them upon an equal foot ing with the army when called Into the government service, by which the obliga tions -and duties of both shall be the same, as well as the equipment and discipline. Civil Service. He asks for such legislation as will place the employes of the District of Columbia in the classified service, and also the era ploves in the insular service. Among other recommendations is one asking for legislation that will improve the consular service; one th-t will cease to recognize the Indian as a member of a tribe but as an individual, and a distribu tion of the tribal funds. For the Indians he also asks for the establishment of in dustrial schools and the stopping of the issue of rations. He asks a liberal appror priation for the Louisiana Purchase expo sition and an appropriation to cover the expense of transferring the government exhibits at Buffalo to the exposition at Charleston, which the Charleston exposi tion has paid. Another recommendation is for a per manent census bureau, which, he says, would insure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work in that department. The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth of the postal service, and points to the fact that the deficit of the service has been re duced to the comparatively small sum of $3,923,727. This he says could be still fur ther reduced, and possibly a surplus shown, but for the fact that many pub lications are now securing the pound rate as second-class matter which are not law fully entitled to the same, but that the department has now undertaken to re move the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and asks that it be tustained in its effort. He calls attention to the settlement of the Chinese difficulties, and our part in the work, and says that China has prom ised reforms that will in the future guar antee protection to foreign representa tives within her boundaries.
