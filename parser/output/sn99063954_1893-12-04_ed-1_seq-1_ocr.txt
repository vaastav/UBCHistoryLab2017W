THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Washington, Dec. 4. Following Is a synopsis of President Cleveland's message to congress, whloh assembed At noon today. The entire document contains about twenty thousand worn on. nr0aAcnt beclns with our foreign ro'ailons saying In part: While our for eign relations have not at all times dur ing the past year been entirely c from perplexing and embarrassing situ atln. notnlns remains that will not yield to a spirit of fairness and love of justice which, Joined with consistent firmness, shouia cnarauiun" -j American policy.

The Uulted States are especially Interested la tbe successful achievement of tbe vast undertaking this co tuna nv bas In charce. that it shnu'd be accomplished under distinct ively American auspices, and its enjoy ment assured not ouly to the vessels of this country but the ships of tbo world. HAWAII. It Is hardly necessary for me to slate that tbe questions arising from our rota tions with Hawaii have caused serious embarassment. Just prior to the in stallation of the present administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated be tween the provisional government of the island and the United States and submitted to tbe senate for ratification. Thla treatv I withdrew for examina tion and dispatched Hob. James H. Blount, of Georgia, to Honolulu, ns a special commissioner to make an im partial investigation of the circum stances attending the change of govern raent and of all conditions bearing up on the subject of the - treaty. After n thorough and exhaustive examination Mr. Blount submitted to me bis report showing beyond all question that tbe constitutional government or Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that govern ment and through the intimidation caused by tbe presence of an armed naval firoe of the United Statre whloh was lauded for that purpose at the In stance of our minister. Upon the facta developed It seemed to me that the only honorable courso for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done hv those representing us and to restore, us far as practicable, the stand existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplishing this re sult within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all nnr nhllimtlona and responsibilities growing out of any changes in condi tions brought- auoui uy yur uujusuu able interference, our present minister at Honolulu bas received appropriate Instructions to that end. Thus far no it.furmation of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are h'mui expected When received they will be promptly sent to congress to gether with all other Information at i.,.nil. nocomnunled by a special execu tive message fully detailing tbe acts .uwasurv toa complete undemanding of the case aud presenting a history or allthe material events leading up to the prefent situation.

GOVERNMENT UOKDS. t ,ki. in mmestly suggest the wis dom of amending the exlsllnu statutes lu regard to the Issuance of government bonds.

REVENUES. The Hpcrninrv of tbo treasury renrta that tbe receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, amounted to $401, 710,501,04 and its expenditures to $469,- 374 074.20. Tuero was coiieotcn irom customs $200,3o5,010 75 and from inter national revenues $101,027,623.93. It Is estimated upon the basis of presont rev enue laws that the receipts of the gov-. ernment for the year ending Juno 30, 1894, will be $430,121,305.88 and tts ex penditures $458,121,365 38,reaulttng in a deficiency of $28,000,000. MONEY IN CIROUIiATIOn. On tbe first day of November 1893 the amount pf money of all kinds In circulation or not Included in treasury holdings was $1,718,644,682, an Increase for the year of $112,404,945. Estimat ing our population at 07,420,000 at tbe time mentioned tbe per capita circula tion was $25.49. SILVER LEGISLATION. The recent repeal of the provision of law, requiring the purchase orsuv r bullion by tbo tcovernment as a feature of our monetary scheme, makes a change in the comploxion of our cur rency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this not will be most salutary and far-reaching, In the nature of things, however, It is impossible to know at this time, pre cisely what conditions will be brought abotit by the change or what, If any, supplementary legislation may In the light of bucIi conditions appear to bo es sential or expedient Of course, after the recent financial perturbation, tlmo is necessary for tho re-establlsbmcnt of business confidence. When, however, through this restored confidence tbe money which has been frightened Into bldlug places is returned totradoand pntomrlse. a survey of tbo situation will probably disclose a safe path, leading to a permanently sound aud abundant currency. COAST DEFENCES AND FORTS, Tho message says: It Is gratifying to note that we havo begun to attain completed results in the comprehensive scheme of sea coast defence and fortifl cillona entered upon eight ytors ago. AUAINST THE FEB SYSTEM. I cauuot too heartily indorse the proposition, says tho president, that the fp uvBtem. as annlluable to the compen sation of United States attorneys, mar shals, clerks of federal courts, aud Unl tn.) Hiuten commissioners, should be abolished with as little delBy us possible It Is clearly In tho Interest or ttio com munity that the business of the courts hnfti lvlt and criminal sbull be as in. expensively transacted as the ends of Justice will allow. The system Is there fore thoroughly vicious wuicni mne tho compensation of court officials de pend upon the volume of such business l'OBTAL

It Is a Bpeclcs of gratltudo at public cost. Under this action of legislation there was sent out from tho agricultural deportment dur ing the last fiscal year nlue million paokagea of flowers and vegetable seeds and tbey were sufficient, if planted, to cover 89,505 acres of land. THE PENSIONS. On tbe 30th day of Juue, 1893, there wero on the. pension rolls 900,012 names, an increase of 88,044 over the number on tbo rolls Juno 80, 1802. The number added to tbe ro a during tue vear was 123.034 and the uumber dropped was 84,090j tho discovery hav ing beon made that many names nau been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic fraudr. The commissioner suspended payments upon a uumber or pensions wuiou seem to bo fraudulent or unauthorized, pend ing a completo examination, Riving uo tlco to the pensioner In order that tboy might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the Justice of their claim, notwithstanding apparent Invalidity.
