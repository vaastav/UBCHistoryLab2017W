'i'he Pension Disability Act lias nut en lailid a gieater outlay tlinu was anticipated. Tie President thinks that the liberal cu itiigeinent of tie pension law should sug gest a more ci.relul scrutiny of bills for special relief. : The beet-stigar industry is declared to Law cßsstu the stages ot experiment and in i v lie regarded as a complete success. The McKinley tariff is discussed at some length. The Tresident deprecates the idea ..of subjecting Ihe act to Important changes u-.tli it has beeu fairly tried. There is, he says, "neither wisdom not Justice inthe suggestion that the subject of tariff revision sll sill be opened before this law has had a f.iir trial." The reciprocity clause in tbe la; ill wisely opens the way to secure a larger reciprocal trade in exchange for the iree admission to our ports of certain products. The President also makes an argument in fayor of "fiee and honest elections." He .: reviews the law now* ia force providing for Federal supervision of Congressional elec 'ions and points out wherein the measure pri|.o-ed ami passed by the House is more effectitre without beiug in any sense an exercise of new uower. .-The message as a whole shows lhat the President is master of the details of the ■ Government, lie has the lonriigeof his '. convictions and does not hesitate to sup port them with argument. Even those who may not agree witb his cnnihi-d'nns will ad mit tiie force of his rensouiug and the com prehensive intelligence with wliich his views are presented. ir SI ILL l-IVI'.M. A Democratic contemporary prints a table showing the number of Republican I.epiestntatives in e:,ch Congress since the election of N. P. Him!. - as Speaker of the Thirty-fourth Congress, and diaws from the fact that the lb publican representation Is smaller in the Kilty-second Congress than in any preceding Congress since tlio party was organized tbe Inference that the party is "ct ining out a*, the little md of Uie horn." In the Thiil" -fifth Congress the Kepub heanshad but 92 members, five mot e than are elassid as Ucpiiblicans in the Fifty second. In (lie Tbirly-scventh they were down to 100, in the Thirty-eighth to 108, in the Forty-fourth to 108, but they survived all these defeats. There is a good deal of hu man nature in the Republican party. It litis carried on the Government so long that it a-sunies it will he continued in charge, and at times ceases to put forth Its strength. It was entirely within the power of the members of the lb-pub lican party to have elected a majority uf the Kifty-second Congress. Ibe party that (lid elect a majority polled a smaller vole Uian in l-tis, when it lost both Presi dent and Congress. Theie is nothing to show that any ((iii'iderflble number of He publicans voted witli the Democrats, or that any considerable number would huve voted with (he Democrats if they had* voted. The returns sbow that about IH percent of the Republican voters did not vote. The Dcui i.exits polled wittihi 8 per cent of their vote in JtrttiS, and thus carried the Hoiise. The lb-publican patty has simply received the check wbicli in times past lias inspired It to win its greatest victories. 

CHANGING FUO.M. The Sacramento Record-Union has, since the election, shown a disposition to get on the free-trade side of the tariff question. It quotes from the St Louis Qlobe-Democrat to show that it is in good company. It might also quote from the Chicago Tribune, the Springfield Republican, the Providence Journal and other Eepubllcan journals. It is well known that there are Eepubllcan journals which are not in favor of a protec tive tariff as there are Democratic papers Which are. When one quotes from the New York Sun to show a Democratic opinion of : free trade one does not assume that the party is changing fronton the tariff ques tion. Un sectional questions the Ulubc }), mocrai is a good enough Kepubiiran. The same may be said of the Chicago lYt&une. But neither of these excellent papers lias for years been in sympathy with tbe B pub lican party on its tariff legislation. The l.e --1 üblicnn party cannot be charged with Changing front on the strength of evidence that three or four Republican journals con tinue to express the views they have aiways held. TAXATION IN FItANCE. To tiie Ainericau observer, tho financial situation ot some foreign countries is posi tively appalling. If. Pellet m, who woulil be called ill tills country Chairman of the Committeo on Ways ami Menus, ban just riled bis budget with the French Chamber, nnd reports the aggregate debt of the French Republic as 30,300.813,594 francs, sny $6,06*6, --000,000. We wonder bow a people can stag ger imlcr such ;t load of indebtedness. When the first Napoleon was overthrown he left France wiih a debt of some £250,000, --i product of twenty veins of warfare. This was quadrupled under the peaceful btri corrupt regime of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Louis Philippe. Tho republic nf ISIS fouud an existing indebtedness of about $1,000,090,000. This wns more than doubled under "Kapoleon ILL The present republic had to deal with it national debt of about £2,500,000,000. lt purßued precisely the op posite policy to the one which we have folio wed in this country ; instead of reduc ing tho debt, ii has enormously increased it. Three years ago, ita total was nekonedat 5J4, 700, 000,000, and now M. Pelleion -jives it a . $6,000,1 100,01 I', more thau three times the debt of the United Slates. To pay the interest on tbis debt, and to defray the cost of a large amy and navy maintained with a view to a future war with Germany, the French are taxed at the rate of $20 per head per yearfor the entire popu late ii, an.l all sorts of annoying imposts, such as taxes on doors and windows, and salt, and Other necessaries of life, are main tained. Our taxation in this country fur Fed eral purposes is about SU per head per an num. Hut i tire Dtri button for the support of the Federal lioveriiuient and for tiie pay ment of interest on the national debt leaves an annual surplus of about. 1100,000,000, while the annual deficit of French budgets does no! average much less than that sum, 1 1 c 820 which every French man, woman and child has to contribute yearly for the support uf the General Government dues not cover tbe communal taxes. Paris a ione has a debt of $500,000,000, and interest on this Mini must be provided by local taxation. Parisians are likewise called upon to fur nish a laige annual riiiii for the support of ihe vt ry leifect but somewhat expensive gov. nuiKiit i f the municipality. It is grand io he a citizen of the finest city in the world, hut the grandeur comes high. Judging ircm our point if view, in the light if our experience, we should be iu clined to think tbat ti.e ciedit of a country so burdened with debt as France, aud in which the rrte of taxation was so heavy, could not be very gocd. There is a limit beyond which the car aelty of a people to pay taxi - t mnoi be pushed. Bat it seems thnt, in the opinion of Europe, that limit bas net been reached in France. The revenue is collected ;i less f. st than the Cnited Stales Government has lo pay, and the republic can borrow all the mouey it v. ;•!;;- at -1 t r ''_ per ceut. The French are tin r ost thrifty and in money matters Uie most careful people in the world, but they w ill tt.l.i u.t iii savings out of the old stock ing to lend it to tbe Government of the day — whatever it may lu — at 1 per cent. i he gtow ih of the French ilcl.t and ofthe communal debts has had this effect: from being the cheapest country in tire world to live in it Iras become one of the dearest, Paris i- now probably the most expensive metropolis iv Europe. Forty years ago stmlen ts crime up from the country to fol -1 w a course ol law or medicine at l'r.iis. antl lived or. 60t)or fiOO francs, say $120 or • 1 10, a year. Now, if they cannot command an Income ot at least twice that amount tiiey must stint their food and wear old clothes. A family in Paris used to live comforts! ly on $1000 a year; now they are pinched if tbey have only rjr-UtX). Taxation does tell ill the end. VVOItI I>'S r.VIlt M.IiTEHS. Some iiionlhs aizo Congres*i appointed a ct mmittee to look into the manner in which trie bnsinecs of the Wcild's Fair is be ing conducted. Congressman EUvswell P. Flower, who was a n.ein lur of the com mlltee, sin-Dt a week in Cil b ago in tho per f.nnaiii c of his dutier-, and on his return to New York said to a reporter that tbe Na tl nal Commission was altogether too large and too costly a body to I c •■ f any use to the projei tins of the fair, 'i'he Commission now numbers lOfi men aiul US women. Mr. Flower ts 'reported as saving: "1 am op posed to the idea of |,i'ni!ittiii!i snob a body to haiii'ier the Chicago 13. aid of Fair Di rectors with tt coiii;ii"iida'.io!is an.l diverse views and to draw big salaries from the Congressional appropriation of Si,."iii-,000, Which Should be applied ti> the legitimate purposes of the fair. 1 believe that it would lie better for Chicago if tho National Commission should appoint a sub-com mittee of five good men to supervise the election of the buildings antl the work gen erally of tbe local board. This would stop Many salarii-s, and Chicago would In; en r.hled to go on wiih the preparations for the fair in her own way and Willi her own money." 'J here nre probably a good many people i f .".ir. Fkwer's way of thinking. Of what pi s-iijje us( . j,i-,. ji(j i| lf n Hril ] ug women 18 aitls, rdviseis aud siipervisrns of lbc Botirtl of Directors, who really have" the work and Hie responsibility on Heir shoulders? Di rectot-General Davis appears npon later in telligence to look to tire National Commis si! n rather than to tire local directory for authority, lt is determined that the Di nctnr-Gi neral shall appoint the chiefs of bun aus, and that any differences whi.ch nray arise shall be referred to a Board of Joint Control ci mpised of an untal num ber of men from the "National Commission ers and from the local directory. There does not stem to be any head to the man- Bgement, notwithstanding ihe 221 persous who constitute the National Commission. Tbe fiist thing done was tc vt te tne Presi dent, Secretary nnd Yiie-Claiiinaii ni the Executive Committee salaiics ranging from £12,000 lo the first to $8000 liir the last. This is ii rather high price io i ay foi obstruction. Till' llAll.llOAl) 

CO.VIIIINK. II alf a down em imonsly rich railroad men bave given the Farmers' Al.iance ample ground upon which to stand without rdvo catfng nieastires which wiil cause a coiiiliina tion of (rther classes against them. Haifa dozen men, who have made an average of SJjO.OOO.OOO eacli, nnstiy from railroads, have oriranizt d lo secuie for their railroad piop erly higher rates of remuneration. Sir. Jay Guild, who bas made not much less ilian $100,01)0,000 in thirty years out of railroads, is much distressed lest competition among roads reduces the profits of ruuning them so that they will not pay the usual per cent on watered stock. Tho ICocKefellers, who are but a little in the rear of Mr. Gould as money-makers and fully abreast with him in the remorseless execution of plans to shutout competition, put their rjl 1*0,000,000 into a combination which, if successful, will make an independent railtoad in the United Slates impossible. Huntington and Stan fi.id have gone into tiie HUM combination. Possibly they could not help it; probably tbey did not wish to; in either case the mag nitude of the interest working for one end inspires a feeling of alarm all through the country. The live men whose names we have mentioned own comparatively little of the property of the country. They work on the caucus system, which authorizes a m.i joriiy to control a minority. They conlrol such a vast system of railroads rhat other system.", if there are any, are forced to agree tn the policy of ihe comhsne.

Concerning the causes and consequences of financial panics tho Epoch says: So long as pioiuolers aie allowed to spend say 55,000,000 to build a piece cf ratlToarJ, and tlien to slap on It, lor extiinple, 58.000.000 of first moi tgrigtr bonds, $5,000,000 of second-mort:-age bonds, $5,000,000 of piclened slock and SIO, --000.000 ot common stock— or, In other words, 828,000,000 of securities which repteseiit only '►5,000,000 of outlay —so long will panics Uneaten Wall stieet. When a few railroad men complain that railroads are not remunerative they mean that they do nut pay 0 per cent on all the various forms nf slocks aid bonds that bave been issued. They do not mean that the mads do not pay interest on the actual in vestment, but that tho holders of these se curities ate not paid dividends or interest. These bonds are sold by the promoters on the representation that they will pay some thing more thi.n interest on the money in vested. Probably none of the bonds me sold at par, but they are worked off on a confiding public on the promise th.tt interest will be paid on the face value. An investor may pay §75 for a Sioo bond, but he expects to' get luterest ou the SIUO the bond purports to be worth. The enormous profits of the promoters are readily seen. They are sup posed to invest $."i.oo'J,u>o of real money and to issue in one form and another securities to the amount of $2ci,0(j0,000. If they got face value for these securities their profits would he $28,000,000 minus So, 000, 000 of original outlay. Put the promoters are usu ally willing to divide profits with the bond buyer. Put if we allow the promoters to sell bonds at au average of 60 per cent there will be a profit of Siii.MOo.OtO oil au outlay of lii.OOO.OQO. it Is quite Within the province of law to limit the amount of bonds and stick that may be Issued on a given outlay.
