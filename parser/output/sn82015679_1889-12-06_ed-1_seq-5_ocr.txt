THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER G, 1889. - 5 DEATH OF A XOTED DOCTOR Thomas B. Uarvej AYhile Speaking at a Clinic Is Stricken with Apoplexy. He Dies Within a Few Honrs Surrounded ly Bis Family and Friends from a Profession Which He Loyally Served. Dr. Thomas B. Harvey, the most eminent physician in Indiana, died l:st night at his residence, in this city, northwest corner of Delaware and North streets, at a quarter of 8 o'clock. lie was descended from Knjrlish stock; and was the son of the late Dr. Jesse Harvey, also a physician of high attain ments, and a noted Abolitionist and philan thropist in his time, 'fhomas 11. Harvey was born Nov. 29, V$Ti in Clinton couuty, Ohio, removing, when two years old, to Harveysbnrg, in Warren county, that State. His advantages of education were derived from the flarveyburg High-school, an institntion founded by his father, who taught the tirst school in Ohio to which colored children were admitted. When completing his classical course, Thomas be gan the study of medicine in 1816, and prad nated from the Medical College of Ohio, at Cincinnati. His father was, for a time, a missionary among the Indians in what is now the State of Kansas, and his son was there with him. Dr. Thomas B. Harvey's first field of labor was at X'lainfield, to which place he removed in 1851, and where he was married to Miss Delitha Butler, who, like him, was a. member of the Society of Friends. He continued in practice there until 1, when, his reputation enlarging, he ceased to be a country doctor of mere local, fame. His skill was recognized and his services were in demand from all the named he was tendered, and accepted, tho appointment of examining surgeon for tho theu Sixth congressional district, with headquarters at Indianapolis, and a year later removed, with his family, to this city for permanent residence. This position the Doctor held until the close of tho war. Meanwhile, his practice had still further increased, and tho profession at Indi anapolis, always brilliant in its member ship, and especially so at that time, awak ened to the fact that a yonn? man destined to gTeatuess had come among them. Dur ing the year WA) the Indiana Medical Col lege was organized, and Dr. Harvey was appointed to the chair of medical and surgical diseases of women, which ho held to the day of his death. Quick and clear in apprehension, concise and vigorous in language, and a thorough master of the snccial branch of medical science he taught. his clinies have been sought alike by students and nctiro practitioners. For over twenty years Dr. Harvey' was consulting physician in the same special department in the City Hospital, and also in St. Vincent's Hospital since its organiza tion, while for ten years he was consult ing physician to the City Dispensary. Ho aided in the organization of the Hendricks County Medical Society, read the lirst pa per before that bod v. and was subsequently its president. He also aided materially in the organization of the Indianapolis Acad emy of Medicine, and was honored in being elected its lirst president. He became a member of the State Medical Society dur ing the, thirdvearof its existence; was made its vice-president in lSffi, aud its president in l!). lie was also a member of the Ameri can Medical Association, and of the Mis sissippi Valley Medical Society, before which bodies he read many able papers, . which showed him to be faithful observer of the nature and forms of disease, an original thinker, and logical in his reason 1HK. o physician in Indiana had tho love and respectof his fellows as had Dr. Harvey. elder brother to students and young phy sicians. He was adverse to the drudgery of writing, and when called tip for a special paper at meetings of the State Medical So- of manuscript, the mere opening of his sub ject, and. soon finishing the manuscript. would continue the subject without notes, imparting to his lecture ,the greatest inter est, and always eliciting the closest atten tion. The Doctor was an Abolitionist as a boy, and always had a warm heart for all who snftered or were oppressed. His grand mother Burgess (who was a Virginian) ac cepted her patrimony in slaves, that she might bring them to Ohio and liberate -them. At the St. Loui s meeting of the American Medical Association Dr. Harvey had his linger crushed in a cab door, which gave him a severe nervous shock, and to which ho strenuouslv attributed the slight paral ysis of his right arm and limb, which ho suffered last New Year. Since that time his Immediate medical friends have been appre hensive at his condition, and his associates in the Medical -College of Indiana havo used every means within their power to de ter him from active didactic and clinical teaching. But he would not give up. and has insisted on giving his regular Thursd ay lecture and clinic in the present course. For this purpose he was at the college yes terday afternoon at 2 o'clock, lecturing on the effects of hemorrhage and bloodclot, the very cause of his own "sad death. Ho was sitting on a stool, as has been ids later custom, when at 2:20 'clock his son Jesse Harvey, one of tho students, noticed that he was confused and stammering. But as this had occurred before he was not alarmed, but as bis father wavered on tho chair, he jumped over into the arena with savumI nf hnr atnrlonta onrl nrnvrti tod liia falling. The clinical chair on which the doctor had examined hundreds of patients in the twenty years of his college teaching, and for which pa tients were waiting to take . their turn iu the aute-ioom, was rolled in and the Doc tor laid on it and wheeled into the faculty room. Hero he asked for water, which his son gave him, and at onco began to pass into unconsciousness. Ho reached for his notes on 'hematocele" with his un paralyzed hand, and tried to sort and com ment on them for a moment the last effort of a confused brain gorged with blood, try iutr to carry out the last behest of n power ful will and intellect In the meantime Drs. Conaingor, Hadley, Elder, Hodges, Hays. Cook, Ferguson aim others had arrived, and done such things as were appropriate to the case. The ambu lance took him to his horn, and other med ical friends assembled, but nothing could h done to alleviate his condition, and ho died without recognizing any of his family or friends. ' 1 If A 1 1 ut. ii irvey was a siriKingiy iiamisome man, with a 'broad, high forehead, gray curling locks, a tine face and a well-poised head. He would attract attention and re mark in any company. Yet, he was always a modest man, wholly without ostentation, and without the least admixture of profes sional jealousy. "When I saw him at Cin cinnati many yenrs ago," siid Dr. W. H. Wishard, "his hair brown, with a dash of chestnut in his curls, I thought him tho haudsomest 3'ouutc man I had ever seen. I thought then ho had great natural advan tages in his profession if he would avail himself of them, and that he has done so we all now know." fl. ....... 4l ci-4 .it.

Death of a ClaflIcal-School Student. ' Miss Elsie Brown, of Oermantown, Pa., died at the Classical-school residence, on North Pennsylvania street, on Wednesday morning. She never enjoyed robust health, and sho brought with her, as her parents ond both the attending physicians now be lieve, the seed of tho disease that proved fatal. She was endowed with a character of nnnsnal purity and simplicity, which, during her short stay in the school, en deared -her to all whom the met. Her parents and her home physician, who at tended her during her illness, left, last night, for Philadelphia with the remains, after a brief service in the residence of the school conducted by the Kcv.

CAUGHT IN THE UCECK. Two Commercial Travelers Who Were Injured in the Kail road Accident at Fari.?, 111. Two of the passengers who were wounded in the railroad wreck at Paris, 111., Wednes day night, are at tho New Dcnison sIIotel. The reporter was allowed to seo them last evening, after a surgeon had dressed their wounds. Botll of the gentlemen are com mercial travelers, one, E. M. Collins, repre senting a boot and shoo manufacturing house of Buffalo, N. Y and the other, W. II. Lew, representing a similar, establish ment of Rochester, N. Y. Tho former is the more seriously injured, and was in bed. "Wo left Paris last night," said Mr. Col lins, "aud got to the Midland crossing. It was all done in tho twinkling of an eye. The forward end of the car lifted up into the air at an angle of about forty live degrees and went' over The passengers were dropped from the north side of the car to tlio south side. I must havo lost consciousness, as I knew nothing df what occurred in tho car until someone broke a window aud lifted me out. The air revived me, and it was then 1 learned how the accident occurred. Tho Midland road crosses at tnat point, and our engineer did not stop the train, as he should have done. The freight train ou tho other road had the right of way, but the engineer on our train thought ho could get across, and put ou steam to make it, but got caught. Our lights went out instantly, otherwise thero would have been a tire. I found my face covered with blood, a cut four inches long across niv forehead, and onuses on m)r side and umus, yet l don e know how I came by the cnt.v Mr. Lew was in a room near bv with a surgeon putting the tinishiug touches to a large bandage about his head when the reporter called. "I was seated immediate ly in front of Mr. Collins," said he. "At the tirst crash the seats wero loosened, tho lights went out and the car tipped up. Everybod' was thrown from the north to the south side of the car. We were pinned in the wreckage for some time. I assisted in getting out a child and was the last per son out of the car. My left ear is cut through in three different places, the in jury, so fa$ as abrasion and bruise are con cerned, extending to tho back of my neck. My left shoulder is badly bruised and I am very soro across tho chest. Altogether, there were were ten persons injured. One lad3' had her collar bone, wrist and three ribs broken, and a gentleman from Chi cago, connected with the Western News Agency, had several ribs broken and his back injured. 1 think these two persons were the most seriously hurt. We lay fully an hour at the junction before we were cared for. There were no railroad officials about except the conductor, and he was every where. Tho accident. occurred at 9 o'clock at night, and it was 1 o'clock this morning before my head was bandaged. We con cluded to come here where we could be taken care of." Mrs. Lew arrived last evening, and is at her husband's bedside. Election of Officers. Walter Q.

TIIE REPUBLICANS IS LINE Pleased with the President's Message They Commence NYork for a Campaign. The Meeting ot the State Central Committee Where Early Organization 13 Discussed Comments, Speeches and Resolutions. GOOD REPORTS FROM THE STATE. Indiana Republicans in Line with the Ad ministration. The Republicans who came to tho city yesterday to attend the meeting of the ..State central and , executive committees bore from their people a general in dorsement of the President's message. No one had exceptions to take to it. While its literary style was ireqnently commented upon with the utmost favor, its recom mendations were not lost sight of, they5 being received as an assuranco that the Republican platform and promises would bo f ulfilled. Each paragraph of the docu ment contained something for coramenda-; tion as these earnest and loyal Republicans viewed it. It was often expressed by tho representative men of the party who wero here that President Harri son had renewed that guarantee of a wise administration promised in the conli dence the people of this country has in him. "It is an excellent message." said E. H. Nebeker, of Covington. 'No one has any: right to find fault with it It goes to the core of every proposition and puts tho condition of the country aud problems to be solved clearly bofore the people." But these Republican committeemen come with the needs of tho next cam paign work before them. As essential to success it is felt that State issues must be brought prominently before the people. Tn the Twelfth district." said Win. Runyan.of Kendallville, "we recognize the necessity of carrying the State next year. The objective point is, of course, .the Legislature, for there is a great deal of talk among " Republic ans and Democrats of the need of fair legislation. They say. they did not get it from the last General Assembly, which has gone into history as having been notoriously partisan. rho Presidents message has opened the way for us. It is an admirable paper, and I hear no criticism or fault finding. Furthermore, the Presi dent's action in regard to appointments with us has left no friction. In a large measure his selections have given satis faction. Nor ore we Republicans in the Twelfth at all discouraged over the v results ?f the recent elections. The losses in Iowa and Ohio are not attrib uted to the administration. . Thev are due to local causes and we have no doubt but that the lost ground will bo iully retrieved before 18J2. But, returning to Indiana and the immediate work before us, we find several State issues that cannot be passed, bv. They sbould be placed before tho peo ple with all the force and clearness that our press, writers and speakers can com mand. Upon them the result next year will turn. The national administration- is -all richt. as has been Republican manage ment of tho State the last few years. . But' the fact that for two elections successively we have carried the State should spur us to greater energy and effort." "We, of tho Tenth, district," said E. D. Crumpacker, of Valparaiso, "have tho ut-j most confidence in the administration and Congress. What wo particularly desiro now is to have Congress carry out the rec ommendations ctf the President and to do something that will relieve the stringency of the times. This should be done in the interest of the farmers. Even if Congress does no more than give partial relief it will aid in assuring the people that the Repub licans will fulfill alf they have promised' to; do. in the next campaign State issues' should be made prominent." "The people in my locality." said W. Tri Durbin, of Anderson, "are tvginnitfgi tq,. realize that this is purely and strictly a Ite pnblican administration. Tho party . in Madison and Shelby counties is harmonious,: and in Hancock the outlook is very bright. As to President Harrisoua message, I have heard nothing but praise. Only jesterday one of the leading Democrats in my town, whose name I withhold only because ho is an aspirant for ollice, said to me that ho re garded the message as exceptionally well prepared, and an able and impartial dis cussion of tho present situation of public affairs and interests.'.' "The Republicans in tho Sixth congres sional district," said L. D. Stubbs, of Rich mond, "have an unlimited amount of faith in President Harrison. His policy on every Question is approved, and that is savine a great deaL Of course some appointments that have been made have not pleased au, but that could not be expected in any case. Taken as a whole, tho administration is highly praised." 

MEETING OF THE COMMITTEES. Ueartjr Indorsement of President Harrison's Message. The Republican State central committco met last night at the New Deuison Hotel in Room 2. All the committeemen were pres ent except from districts one, three and four, and these wero represented by gentle men holding proxies. A number of other prominent Republicans were also present. L. T. Michener presided, and he reported the following executivo committee: S. J. Peelle, II. McKay. Indianapolis: J. N. Study, Rushville; "W. GT. Sayro, Wabash; E. II. Nebeker, Covington. The following were chosen as advisory committee: A. E. Nowlin, Lawrenceburg; J. -W. 'Johnson, Princeton; J. B. White, Fort Wayne; H. C. Tiuney. Lafayette; C. W. Fairbanks, In dianapolis; Wm. Farrell. Paoli; J. B. Homan, Danvillo. On motion of J. II.Burford, of Crawfords ville, the following resolution was unani mously adopted: Resolved, by the Republican State central committee of Inalana, That we heartily indorse the principles and recommendations set forth In the vcrr able message of President Harrison, and that we believe that the adoption of the recommendations therein contained will bring greater prosperity to our Notion at home and add to our importance abroad, and insure the continuance iu power of that pariy which has ever proved itself m capable of juanaeiug our national affairs in the interest of the whole people. Ilesolved,. That the secretary he instructed to furnish a copy of this resolution to tho Presi dent. It was ordered that the members of the new courp.v committees bo elected on Jan. 11. and that they organize on Jan. 18. It was further ordered that district conven tions to elect State committeemen bo held on. the followiug Thursday. Following this action there was an inter change of views, and reports from all parts of tho State were highly encouraging. Sev eral speeches were made commendatory of the message. Secretary of State Gritlin Kaid he believed it as a whole ought to meet tho approval of the Republicans of the entire State. Governor Hovey spoke of the President's loyalty to country aud to party, and that ho, the Governor, stands en the same planks, and wants to see tho greatest success achieved by the' Republicans. Mr. Burford, of Crawfords ville, thought the President had not gono so far ou various points as he might have done, but he cannot be charged with hav ing none wrong. Mr. Rovse, of Warsaw, said the message met with his hearty ap proval, and he thought there was a deter mination among Republicans to carry In diana in the next campaign. Mr. Swove land, of Tiption, said the message stuck closely to the platform noon which the President had been elected, and that the message is in harmonv with the wishes of tho part3'. Mr. Stubbs, of Richmond, and Mr. lrwm, of Columbus, also spoke, giving like appreciation of tho message, as did al?o Mr. Crumpacker. The committee theu adjourned. I will say," remarked Joseph I. Irwin, of Columbus, to tho reporter, "that the Re publicans of my city and county are de lighted with President Harrison's message. I have not heard a single adverse criticism f rom mrinjjera of our party. We have no kickers in Columbus, an we are of the Ktal wart kind. It occurs to me that wo will uo into the next State contest iu good con dition, as the many inihtakcs of tho Into legislature cannot be defended by the Democratic party in an open lihtucforo the people. Of course, all their shortcom ings will bo fully developed when the can vass is well opened." Treftirient Harrinon Coming. An Associated Press telegram was re ceived last night, from Washington, stating that President and Mrs. Harrison will leave for Chicago to-day. They will be accompanied by First Assistant Postmaster general Clarkson and wife, Miss Wana maker, and Private Secretary Halford, and will come here. It is probable they will remain here over Sunday. HOW 

TIIE LAW OPERATES. Count j Superintendents Not Allowed Compen sation for Distributing School-Books. Another phase of tho school-book ques tion, and one which will probably bring about lengthy and troublesome litigation, has appeared in Rush county. The super intendent of schools in that county recently presented his bill for work done under the new school-book . law, but . tho Couu ty Commissioners wero ; advised by their attorney not to allow any such claim. It was held that it was not right to use tho funds of the county to pay the a'gent of a private corporation lor plac ing its books before the people. "This is not a new point in the new school-book law," said a lawyer yesterday, "but ono that' has been fully argued in the cases which have appex red in the conrts. There is no question but that the law is unconsti tutional on account of this feature." , The lawyer further said that tho state ments to tlio effect that teachers who re fused to use the new books stood in danger of having their licenses taken from them by the couuty superintendent were not war ranted. Such au act would be entirely without law or precedent. "The county superintendent," he continued, "has no more right to make tho course of study for the county than the State 8uperintaident has for the State. Under tho old law the county superin tendent had no voice in the matter further than as a member of the County Board of Education. I have not been able to see where tho new law gives him any additional power. The county superintendent revoking a teacher's license for ref using to use the new hooks would exceed his authority and make himself liable for damages." k The Commissioners of this county yes terday disallowed a claim of Superin tendent Flick for extra clerk hire, rendered necessary by the distribution of the Beck told books. REPORTING TO THE GOVERNOR. A Successful Year for the State Normal School Notwithstanding Its Loss hj Fire. The annual reports concerning the affairs of the State Normal School, at Terre Haute, have been submitted to Governor Hovey. They show tho work in tho school to be in a very satisfactory condition, while the number of students is constantly increas ing. Tho new building, replacing that de stroyed by fire, has been occupied since the opening of tho school year in September. It is much better adapted to the purposes of the school than tho old one. The con tracts for the new structure amounted to 12M.!'55.?U. The president of the faculty. Prof. r. V. Parsons, reports that since the organization of the school in 1870 students havo registered from tho various counties in tho State to the nnraber of 5.7C2. During ' the past year 159 graduates , if, commissioned high-schools attended the school. The discipline has been intelligently conceived and administered. The report of the board of visitors was a very sat isfactory one, and highly compli mentary to the officials of the school. The report of the secretary of the board of trustees showed the receipts during tho past year to have been &'$1.G34.S2, and the expenditures $:I3,272.!, leaving a balance of S8,:;02L57. The annual report of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, at Knightstown, has also been submitted to the Governor. It states that the institution isin a very satisfactory : condition. Improvements are contem plated which, with' the addition ;of a new hospital recently com pleted, dining-room and kitchen, will cost altogether $13,849. There are at present Ute boys and UU girls in the institution, of which number, beventy-three boys and I forty-seven girls are being taught various 'trades. The farm attached to the home is thoroughly cultivated, and the sale of its products during the xast year realized S4.870.C2. 

WORKING FOR TIIE CHURCIIES. . A Sacred Concert at the Grace Episcopal Cathedral. A sacred concert was given last night at Grace Episcopal Cathedral. It was to mark tho tirst use of tho new organ, which has been given as a memorial by Mr. Deloss Root to tho church. The organ is finished in oak, and has a sweet tone, particularly rich and mellow. Dr. Dadswell, of Oxford, England, presided at the instrument and rendered a programme of severely classical compositions, including Andante, on. 21, Beethoven; Prelude and Fugue, by Bach; Larghetto, by Hummel; Communion in O, by Batiste Tnema on a Greek Melody, by Saint Saens; Andante in G, by Henry Smart, and Tono Picture No. 5 by Wagner. The onb number not classical was an ar rangement of Snlli van's "Lost Chord." Mrs. Zelda Seeuin Wallace sang admirably, "O. .Rest in the Lord," by Mendelssohn. Rev. James D. Stanley, of Terre Haute, a very good tenor, gave T,Comfort Ye My People," by Handel, and a recitative and aria, "Be hold and See." by the same composer. The singers, assisted by Miss Carlton, then ren dered "Lift Thine Eyes," by Mendelssohn. Previous to beginning the programme Rev. Mr. Swan asked the audience to refrain from any demonstrations of pleasure, so whatever appreciation there was, was si lent. Entertainment to Come. The Roberts Pr rk ladies are doing well in arranging for their select concert at Tomlinson Hall on the 18th. Prof. Roney, of Chicago, will be in attendance and fur nish line music, and through the kindness of Prof. Barus and tho management of the May festival chorus about one hundred of the singers will take part. Such a chorus accompanying a tine soloist will be a great attraction. . Dr. J. L. Wi throw, of Chicago, willlecturo at the First Baptist Church, on Monday, on "Structural and Doctrinal Unity of the Bible." On Sunday morning he will preach at the Second i Presbyterian Church, of which he was formerly pastor. Mrs. Ben Northrnp, ot Butlalo, formerly of this city, will arrive Monday to take part in tho Breton Fete. She will give tho shadow dance from Dinorah each evening. The workers in the booths are expected to be at Tomlinson Hall Saturday morning to decorate the booths. 

AMUSEMENTS. GRAND orERA-IIOUeiE -MA GOLD MINK." There was a line audience at the Grand Opera-housa last night to greet Nat C. Goodwin. He appeared as Silas K. Woolcot in "A Gold Mine," both character and play being more pretentious than any in which he has appeared in this city. If bis ''ad mirers came with the expectation of losing that generous fun to which they havo been accustomed in Mr. Goodwin's presentations, they were agreeably disappointed, for Woolcot is broad enough for frequent out oroppings of tho actor's strong individual ity. That individuality has largely pro moted his fortunes and fame, for, without it,, whatever he undertakes would miss tho very spirit of the characters peculiarly suited to him, and Woolcot. though on a higher plane than those with which the public is familiar, is one of them. It is typical of a certain class of Americans who have given theircouutrymen a reputa tion for boundless impudence. While it portrays the ease and readiness of tho man of the world, it carrys with it the essence of relinement. The play turns upon Wool cot's visit to Londou to dispose of a cold mine, and in the run of incidents thero are many that allord great tcope; for amusing staire business. The dia'one is crispy, with clear-cut phrases and telling hits on current English politics. Tho scene between Woolcot and the Hon. Mrs. Meredith a character that supplies a counter irritant as it were, to Woolcot is happily sustained by Miss Isabclle Coe. This lady is as finished in her work as is Goodwin in his, and her English thought and manner serve to bring out more forci bly the dash, vigor and sang froid of tho witty American. Miss Coe lias an excel lent stage presence, a graceful method, and, withal, a finish that makes her part one of the best settings in the play. But all the company are good, ond Mr. Goodwin is none the less happy in his selection for the various roles than in his inimitable personation. The George Riordan of Paul Arthur, the Sir Edward Foxwood of John H. Brown, and Miss Fox wood of Miss MaeDurfee, aud the Mrs. Vandervas of Miss Cecil Rush, are all so well given that the play never lacks for in terest, "A Gold Mine' will be repeated to night and in tho performances to-morrow. i NOTES. To-morrow night, at English's Opera house, the Howard Burlesque and Specialty Company will make its only appearance of the season.
