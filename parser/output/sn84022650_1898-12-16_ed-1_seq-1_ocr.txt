THREE KILLED, MANY WOUNDED The Trouble Was Caused by an KfTort Account ' to Close the Theaters on of Garcla's Death. Havana, Doc. 14. After the news ol General Garcla's death spread through Havana early yesterday afternoon, the Cubans wished to have all the places oi amusement closed. They suceeded in dosing two places frequented by Cubans, but the management of the Tacon theater, where there were many Spanish officers among the audience, refused to close the house. Thereupon Allegretto, a former captain of the Cuban troops, got into an excited argu ment with the manager of the theater, and was escorted to the sidewalk by the police on duty. There Allegrette entered into a heated discussion with a Spanish officer, who struck him across the face with tbe flat of his sword. Then there was a collision between the Cubans and Spanish military men, more blows were struck on both sides, and many persons from the cafes and park cheered for Spain and brought crowds of people to the spot from ad jacent streets and squares. Suddenly a shot was fired, whether by a Cuban or by a Spaniard, inten tionally or accidentally, cannot be said, and the Cubans retieated into the Ho tel Ingleterra. More shots were filed on both sides, and Arturo, a French citizen, born in Havana, was shot and seriously wounded while sitting at a table. More shots were fired, and Cubans ran through the hotel office and made their way upstairs. Jesus Solongo, a Cuban, fell wounded on the stairs, and another wounded man broke into the room occupied by Lieutenant Fitzhugh Lee, son of tbe famous general, and the former consul-general .tere, demanding protection. Genera' Greene and sev eral members of his staff, who had been out on a balcony watching the crowd, heard the uproar in the hotel, and went into the corridor. So soon as the Span ish officers saw General Greene, who was in uniform, they stopped the pur suit of tbe Cubans, saluted and --etired. In the meantime, Eastaquino Lemus had been fatally wounded in the street, and Pedro Blesa and Senor Jiminez had been killed. Shortly after the Spanish guards on duty swarmed in from the neighboring streets, and order was restored. At the time the Cubans and pursuing Spaniards ran through the Hotel Ingle terra, General Humphreys was in the lobby, talking to M-in Martin, of Gen 3i uen- era I ifK0ttKKHtttKI: e r vmnm men. A bullet shattered a mirror near which they stood, and two others splintered the stairoase. R. S. Howland, editor of the Provi dence Journal and Mr. W. L. Reilly, a New York contractor, were jostled by the sudden rush of shouting and fight ing men. General Julio Sanguilly was sitting at a table in the lobby. The violent scenes in the office and on the stairs lasted, however, for only a few minutes. On the outside the Spanish soldiers were clearing the great square and streets in the vicinity. The hotel was full of American officers and civil ians, and some of them with their wives were standing on the balconies at the imminent risk of being hit by bul lets fired at an upward angle to scare the crowds. From that point they watched the spectacle in the electric lighted square. It is reported that in addition to those killed and wounded who have been previously mentioned, 14 are be ing oared for in private houses. Three arrests were made. A fow minutes after the shooting in the hotel fright ened patrons and Cubans gathered around General Greene asking if he would protect them. He assured them he believed they were safe, but tbe only recognised authority in Havana was the Spanish executive. He then sent Captain Cole and Lieutenant Steven" to General Castellanos to inquire what was being done to preserve order. The latter replied that the cafes had been ordered closed, and the streets cleared, while troops in sufficient numbers to keep the peace had been posted in the! squares and thoroughfares. Two ol tbe aids of General Castellanos called upon General Greene and gave him further personal assurances. Telephone messages describing the occurrence were sent to General Wade in Elvedado, and General Greene cabled to Washington a brief statement of the facts. What was taking place in the city was all unknown to the Amer ican warships and transports in the harbor, nor did the news reach there until this morning. The United States evacuation com missioners and General Greene sent General Clous and Captain Hart at noon today to exchange views with the Spanish commissioners. It was ar ranged that all the Cuban officers and soldiers, including General Julio San guilly and Jose Laoret. should go to the camp near Mariano and remain out of the city until the Spanish forces were withdrawn. Mr. Jerome, the British consul, had already called at the palace on tbe same mission. Astonishing- Chinese Reform. London, Dec. 13. The Peking cor respondent of the Daily Mail says: An imperial rescript just issued sentences to death a Chinese literatus who wrote threatening letters to a foreign missionary in Kiang Si, and confers Chinese honors on the missionary for his tact and forbearance in the matter.

EXPANSION OPPOSED. Senators Test and Hoar Desire So Philippines. Washington, Dec. 14. Discussion of two questions, each of importance and interest at this session, was begun by the senate at its session today. Terri torial expansion and the construction of the Nicaragua canal occupied the atten tion of the body duiing the greater part of the afternoon. As soon as the routine morning busi ness had been disposed of, Mr. Vest (Dem. Mo.) called up his resolution offered last week, declaring it to be un constituional for this government to acquire foreign territory except for coal ing stations or some like purpose, un less its intention was to confer state hood upon the territory and citizen ship upon its inhabitants. Mr. Vest declared it was a basio principle of thia government "that the powers of the government were derived from the con sent of the governed," and maintained that the federal government had no authority either in morals or fn the constitution to go beyond that princi ple. He held that the principle had been sustained by the supreme court in various deoisions, and that no public man of prominence and no recognized tribunal had ever been reckless enough to controvert it. Mr. Morgan opened the debate on the oanal bill with a three hours' appeal for action at this session. The whole country, he said, would be disappoint ed if congress did not act. He was willing to take any measure which would result in the building of the canal. In the course of his remarks, he agreed to accept an amendment spe cifically excepting the canal from neu trality with regards to any country with which the United States might be at war.

LfflfflR STORMED CUT Iloilo Assaulted the Night of December 1. fOOK ALL BUT ONE TRENCH According: to a Spanish Report, They Were Finally Repulsed With Great Loss Deaths at Manila. Manila. Dec. 13. According to re liable advices received from Iloilo, capital of the island of Panay, in the Visayas group, the insurgents attacked Iloilo the night of December land cap tured all the Spanish trenches, except one. They then notified General Rios to remove the women and children, ariJ threatened to renew the attack on the following night.

FILES HER PROTEST. Spain Accepts the Consequences 111 Naturedly. Madrid, Dec. 13. The government entirely approves the memorandum of protest against the action of the United States commissioners, filed by Senor Montero Rios, at Paris. The memorandum protests against the refusal of the Americans to surren der the securities deposited in the treas uries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private Spaniards, remarking that "never has a civilized nation committed such an violence." my tbeuiti- e P lilippmeSi Thirdly, it protests against the posi tion in which those Spaniards are placed who desire to remain in Cuba. Fourthly, it protests against the ref erence to the destruction of the Maine in President McKinley's message to congress. On this point the memoran dum says: "Spain has proposed arbitration, but the United States has refused to give her the right which is granted to a criminal; namely, the right of defend ing herself. The Spanish commission ers leave the care of fixing the responsi bility for the explosion to the -entire world, which will say whether those i are responsible who desire the truth, or those refusing to seek it. The newspapers generally express re lief at tbe signing of the treaty. The independent organs, most of tbe provin cial papers and the Carlist and repub lican journals attack both political par ties, conservative and liberal, reproaih ing them equally with having brought the country to the present pass. El Imparcial alone publishes the contents of the treaty, which produces a less unfavorable impression than had been expected, owing to the commercial and other concessions to Spain. El Liberal says: "The Paris negotia tions offer a far sadder spectacle than the ships which are bringing back our repatriated soldiers, deplorable aa the condition of the latter is." Several members of the United States commission were inclined at first to publish the text of the treaty, but Sen ator Frye made a strong plea yesterday for the observance of courtesy toward the United States senate, and his ar guments prevailed. Further details, however, have been learned as to tbe wording of the treaty, wbioh provides that Cuba is to be re linquished and that Porto Rico and the Philippines are to be oeded. The Americans are to pay for the repatria tion of the Spanish troops from all the colonies. The Spaniards are to return ali prisoners held by them. They are to retain possession of all military stores and munitions of war in the Philippines, and of such ships as have not been captured. The commercial treaties between the two nations, which the war ruptured, are to beienewed at the convenience of the two nations. Arrowsmith, I1L. Dec. 10.

DEATH OF GARCIA. rhe Cuban Patriot a Victim of the Northern Climate. Washington, Dec. 18. General Cal ixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban warrior and leader, "and the head of the commission elected by the Cuban as sembly to visit this country, died here this morning, shortly after 10 o'clock, at the Hotel Raleigh, where the com mission has its headquarters. The sudden change from tbe warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships he had there endured, to the wintry weather of New York and Washington, Is responsible for the pneumonia ivhich resulted in his demise. He con tacted a slight cold in New York, ivhich did not assume an alarming stage until 'early the part of last woek. Uist Tuesday night, General Garcia, n company with the other members of ;he commission, attended a dinner jiven in his honor by General Miles, and it was a result of the exposure that :nlminated in his death. ' During the 12 hours or more preced ing dissolution. General Garcia was unconscious most of the time. At in tervals he recognized one or more of those about him. In his dying mo ments, as all through his busy and ac tive life, his thoughts were for his be loved country and its people, and, among his last words, were irrational mutterings, in which he gave orders to his son. who is on his staff, for the bat tle which he supposed was to occur to morrow, and in which he understood there were only 400 Spaniards to com bat. Just before he died he embraced his son. Rev. Father Magee, of St. Patrick's church, was called in during the day, and was with General Garcia until the end, administeriug the last rites of the Catholic church. Other members of the commission and Mr. Rubens, their counsel in this country, were also in the bed-chamber when the end came. The remains were immediately pre pared for burial, and were placed on a bier in the room in which he died. A large Cuban flag served as a covering, and the head rested on one of smaller dimensions. The face and bust were left exposed to public view. The fea tures had a remarkable lifelike appear ance, and gave no indication of the suffering which the deceased had borne. Just above the head rested a magnificent floral piece of red and white ribbon. By direction of Major General Miles a detachment of soldiers from battery E, Sixth artillery, under command of Lieutenant Cox, was de tailed as a body guard for the remains. General Garcia, whose name will ever be linked with those of other pa triots who have fought against unequal odds for the freedom of his country, has had a most active and varied life, most of which has been spent in fight ing for the cause of Cuban liberty, which he had the satisfaction of peeing accomplished so short a time before his death. He was a man of culture and n 6nement, oJBMSMVMP4eT i came frcas a distinguished family of Jaiquaui.of Santiago de Cuba province. He was born in Cogquin, October 14, 1839, and was therefore in his 60th year. BRYAN'S RESIGNATION. Chinese Decoration for Lieutenant Colonel Tifquain. Savannah, Ga., Dec. 13.

YEAR'S WORK IN ALASKA Progress Made in Mining: Development Value of the Salmon Indus try Agriculture in the Far North Necessary Legislation In teresting' Report of Governor Brady, of Alaska One of tbe most interesting docu ments recently received at the interior department is the annual report of John G. Brady, governor of Alaska. The report is very elaborate in its treatment of subjects relative to the great Noith west territory, covering everything from mission stations to the mining indus tries. Probably more space is devoted to gold mining than any other subject, that being tbe predominating industry at the present time. Of this, Mr. Brady says: "The past year has been one of won derful progress. During the winter and spring all sorts of vessels were put into the Alaska trade, and were filled with passengers and cargo to the very limit. Before long, thousands of tons of freight could be seen piled upon and under the snow upon the summits of the Alaskan mountains. The United States contributed by far the largest number of prospectors, who came from all quarters, a large number from every state in the Union, California, Oregon and Washington sending the largest contingents. These prospectors, as a class, were fine specimens of manhood. "It is calculated that 3,200 outfitted for Copper river, several hundred went over the divide at Yakutat, and some parties went over the Dalton trail and worked their way up the White river, one of the largest branches of the Yu kon. Cook Inlet, Resurrection bay, Golovin bay, Kotzebue sound, Koyukuk river and many other places have all been visited by prospectors this season. The declaration of war against Spain checked tbe tide. Most of the Amer icans who proceeded to Dawson com plained of the mining lules and regula tions, and the manner in which they were carried out. This had the effect to drive many upon the Alaska side, and the claims which were abandoned for the first onrush to the Klondike were relocated, and much other valua ble ground discovered, which will keep large numbers of men there this winter. "There is no way of ascertaining the amount of dust washed out upon the Alaska side. The amounts given for 'the Klondike and its tributaries- vary very much. Several reasons are given why the output is smaller than was anticipated the scarcity of supplies, especially lights, the high price of labor, and the 10 per cent royalty ex acted. Many claims are being held with the expectation that supplies will be more abundant and not so dear, and consequently cheaper labor, and that the loud complaint against the royalt. r4'il cause the Otta abolish it. There wflHpsTo supplies this winter, but there appears to be a determination among the miners to koep up wages, and the royal ty is still demanded. So we can expect the product for the coming year to be much curtailed." Speaking of quartz mining, he says: "Very rich ore was discovered in the vicinity of Ketchikan, and many loca tions have been made and developed. Quartz locations have also been made at various places around the coast and upon the' islands, as far as Unalaska. The greater number of these are held by poor men who are not able to make developments of any considerable ex tent. Alaska is a splendid field for a class of men who can command capital and who can examine these discoveries and come to terms with the owners for the purpose of development and sale. While important discoveries of gold have been made on Pine creek, flowing into Lake Atlin, the fields in the vicin ity of Bald Eagle and Sum Dum Chief, as well as Sheep creek, near Juneau, have made even better showings in the past year than previously." Favorable reports are made of the operations of the large American min ing companies at work in Alaska, their efforts seeming to be more abundantly rewarded than are those of foreign cor porations. Land Laws. So much of the land laws as relates to mineral lands and mining claims, inasmuch as they are the same as are now in force in the United States proper, have given perfect satisfaction throughout Alaska, but in the matter of homestead laws, quite a different state of affairs exists. The idea that a man may dig out ore upon lands and obtain patent for the same but cannot build a house and improve land for a home, nor obtain title to it. is regarded as highly unjust and imprudent by the residents of that country. As a matter of fact, the land office has issued but one patent under the law ot March 3, 1898, for trade and manufacture, and the amount of land an applicant re ceives depends not on any law, but entirely on the will of the land officer. Even the law which passed last May, extending the homestead rights to Alaska, is found to be practically val ueless. "There are no surveyed lands in Alaska, nor has any system of survey been provided. It is impossible, there fore, for a poor' settler to acquire a homestead. If he were able and will ing to stand the expense of a survey, Heaviest Oriental Cargo. The Nippon Yuse'n Kaisha steamship Kinshiu Maru, which sailed from Yoko hama for Seattle November 29, is bring ing the heaviest caigo ever shipped from the Orient for Seattle. It consists of 8,500 tons of tea, silk and curios. The heaviest previous cargo was brought on tbe Agapanthus, which arrived in De cember, 1896, with 2,700 tons. The Kinshiu is also bringing the marines to man tho Japanese cruiser Chitose, un der construction in San Francisco. Will Protect Their Fruit. The Clark county fruit farmers are at the bead of a movement whioh will compel the plain labeling of all Wash ington prunes sent out to the genera) market. The Washington crop has been almost entirely sold to California dealers, who put their stamp on the boxes and sell them as a California prod act. Seeking Honolulu Trade. Birmingham & Co., flour and feed dealers of Tacoma, recently sent a rep resentative to Honolulu to open up business connections for the firm. V eH Hate he would have no assurance that it would be accepted by the government. If he settles as a squatter and makes improvements, be cannot tell how future surveys may affect him. In con sequence of this condition of affairs, not a single homesteader has attempted to make entry under the new law in the land office at Sitka." In the matter of wagon roadB, rail roads, etc., a different condition exists. As soon as the right of way bill had passed, numbers of filings were made, and several roads of various character are now in progress of construction. At Unga, Berner's bay and Douglass island there are railways in operation, although solely for use in connection with the mines. The Pacific & Arctic Railway & Navigation Company has probably made more progress than any of the other large companies, having completed 14 miles of road over almost impassable country. Moreover, so much of the road as is completed is constructed of the best material, by the best of workmen, and is in every way first-class. Money has not been spared, and as a result the road stands without a peer. It might be mentioned, in this connection, that, owing to the limita tions of the timber laws, it was found best to import a great deal of timber, and nearly all the timber and lumber used in building Dyea and Skagway, their railroads and mills, was shipped from Pugest sound. The governor expresses the hope that congress, during the short session, will pass upon a code of civil procedure for the district of Alaska. Salmon Industry. Of the salmon industry, a great deal is said. There can be no doubt that this industry is one of great importance, for from figures given it is seen that the Alaskan output in the last year marketed at 12.977.019. The red salmon seems to far outnumber all oth ers, although the pink and silver salmon are found in large numbers. Comparatively few king salmon were taken last year. To pack these salmon for shipment, over 5,000 laborers are I employed, and, strange to say, the most of them are Chinese. It has been found almost impossible to educate the native Alaskan Imiyin to American canning methods, and this, together with the lact that Chinese labor is ex ceedingly cheap, may account, in a measure, for the large number of Chi nese in the canneries. This salmon trade during the past year was of suffi- zii-nronortions to keep in constant aijgi, 63 steamers, in boats. In the opinion of tbe governor, Alaska should be well supplied with inspectors, the present foroe of two be ing decidedly inadequate. Agricultural Possibilities. As an agricultural country, Alaska is still in its infancy, little being known of its possibilities. Enough can be learned, however, from experiments made in the past year, to satisfy those interested that such crops as potatoes, cabbage, beets, peas and other market vegetables can, with proper attention and care, be raised in parts of the coun try without difficulty. But grass, be yond everything else, promises to be the agricultural wealth of Alaska. This is but little appreciated at present. The native grasses are nutritious, and grow luxuriantly. Timothy, clover and other cultivated varieties do well, one acre of giound in grass there, for pas turgage, being worth several acres in a drier climate. There are many varie ties of native berries, such as currants, huokleberries, etc., but- berries from the States, as a rule, do well under cul tivation. "Of stockraising." says the report, "but little can be said. Reindeer will soon be reared in vast herds. In the near future we expect to have the mail transported by reindeer all over North ern Alaska during the winter, and at much less cost than at present." The Governor's Recommendations. Before closing tbe report, a number of recommendations are made. Among them is the suggestion that Japonsky island be built up as a naval station. Attention is also called to the fact that at Kadiak, Unga, St. Michaels, Circle City and Dyea there is a great lack of proper courtrooms and jails, aa well as I at Sitka, where the buildings are in miserable condition. The appropriation for Alaskan schools has been found quite insuffi cient, being but $30,000 per year. An appropriation of twice that size could easily be utilized to good advantage. A further recommendation is made to the effect that lighthouses and other beacons be placed at conspicuous points along the coast, as the commerce has greatly multiplied of late and demands such protection. Governor Brady oloses his report with an appeal to the Republican party to live up to its pledge and extend to Alaska the privilege of sending a dele gate to tbe national congress. Hop Outlook. A good outlook for the future of the hop crop of this year is presented, as there is a good demand for them and a rather short supply. The market is at present buying oautiously. They have done very little purchasing this year, so far, and it is almost certain that a good demand will in conseqeunce re sult. English buyers are now purchas ing only very choice hops, the price paid here being about 15 o and about 8c to the buyer in England. Sonoma county, Cal., has the honor of receiving the highest prioe paid this year for hops on the Pacific coast, some Sonoma hops selling for 19a Some choice Oregon hops brought 18o in some cases. The orop of the coast is placed at 135,000 bales, there being about 12, 000 yet left in the hands of the farmers. Oregon's crop of hops was 65,000 bales, and there are about 1,700 bales yet left with the farmers. This is a decided improvement over the crop of last year; but the crop ia still under tbe figures given before the hop lice got into the yards, which will materially effect tbe output. auuiuorr tufiuo i j
