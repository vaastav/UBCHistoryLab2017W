BEGINJEIR WORK Sixty-First Congress Meets in Regular Session, BRILLIANT THRONG PRESENT i House Greets Speaker Cannon with Great Applause Many "Taft Pol- . Icy" Bills Introduced In Both Chambers. By EDWARD B. CLARK. Washington, Dec. C At noon today "Vice President Sherman In the Senato and Speaker Joseph O. Cannon in tho Houso called to order tho Sixty-first congress of tho United States for its first regular session. Really tho first bcssIoii of this congress was tho extra ordinary ono of last spring called to revise tho tariff. Some Interest was Inciting In tho proceedings of tho first day In tho cap ltol hocauso nt tho beginning of tho extraordinary session In March last tho speakor of tho House was elected. Moreover, beforo tho extraordinary session was ended, Speaker Cannon appointed all tho committees which aro to take legislation under consid eration for tho next two winters. Tho appointment of tho committees ended tho campaign on 'tho part of tho mem Speaker Joseph G. Cannon. llfKL ' 0rB for cll0,c0 clinlruiunshlps and, If ivEr the-chairmanships wcro not forthcom- 18 ing, for seats In tho more important HV subsidiary bodies of tho House. HR Galleries Are Crowded. B Tho galleries of both Houso and j B Senate were jammed with people. All HJ classes of Washington society were Hi represented In tho throng of visitors. Wm Tho diplomatic gallery In the House BH and In the Senate as well, was filled $M to Its fullest capacity with ambassa- WS dors, ministers, attaches and the la- W dies ,of tho different legations. Mem- r' 4 J)ors of tho families of tho president H and of the vice-president of tho United B' , States occupied seats in tho cxccutlvo Mi i galleries, and tho cabinet and judici- jBa ary and army and navy circles were jMt well represented. H u Uy a rule which was adopted not IB ' I long ago, flowers aro barred from tho jfl J- floor of tho Houso excepting when '"'. they are to be used as a tribute to H ' ), tho memory to some deceased mom- ber. The result' of this rulo is that H, now on the opening days of congress H tho desks of tho members aro bare of HJ floral decorations. IH At Bharp noon Speaker Cannon I called the House to order nnd asked B tho chaplain, Row Henry N. Couden, B to offer prayer. In his prayer which B was In a sense a Thanksgiving offer- B Ing, the chaplain referred to tho pros- B In the Promised Land. H Perhaps, when we're In tho prom- 1mWfr ' Ised land, we'll forget that there over Hb was such a place as this old world, H and yet there are pleasant paths and HJ friendly faces wo'll never want to for- Hi get, and dreams wo'll take to heaven H with us.

As soon as the prayer was rnded tho clerk of tho Houso called tho roll of membership by states and It was found that there wore only a fow ab sentees. Tho roll call ended tho read ing clerk of the Senato who had ap peared in tho Houso was recognized, nnd ho announced that tho Upper Houso had passed a resolution to in form tho Houbo of Representatives that a quorum of tho Sonate being as sembled, that body wns ready to pro ceed to business. The House ntso was told that tho Senato had appoint ed a committco to Join n Houso com mittco to inform tho president of tho United States that n quorum of each houso was present and that congress was ready to receive any communica tion that, ho ."may bo pleased to make." On receipt of this messngo from tho spnnto, Speaker Cannon ap pointed a committee to Join n like committco of the Senato to wait upon tho president. The mombors of tho body directed to notify Mr. Taft that tho House was in session wero by tho appointment of the Bpoakor, tho Re publican leader, Sereno E. Pnyno, and tho Democratic leader, Champ Clark. Tho first day In tho House as usual brought out hundreds of leglslatlvo measures In bill form, all of which wcro read by their tltlo only and ro fcrred to tho proper commlttcos. It was evident from tho tono of tho bills Introduced that somo scores of repre sentatives wero anxious to father measures which had been recommend ed by President Taft as being neces sary to carry out proposed policies of progression. Tho bills ranged from thoso Intended to correct alleged ox lBtlng evils In Interstate commerce to those to glvo Increases of pensions to veterans of tho civil war. Applause Greets Speaker Cannon. If Speaker Cannon anticipates any particular trouble with tho "Insur gents" of tho House nt tho coming session, ho gave no ovldejico of It when ho took tho chair as presiding olllcer. Ho wns greeted with great npplauso from the galleries and from tho floor of tho House, many of tho Democrats and Insurgents joining in tho demonstration, though in oither case possibly tho hand-clapping wns given ns an evidence of regard for tho olllco of speaker, rather than as evi dence of any overwcanlng affection for the speaker himself. With tho committees ready to begin work, tho Houbo will sottlo down to its winter's business at onco. No bills will bo passed immediately hocauso all mensuros must be considered In committeo, and tho meetings of tho committees will ho hold dally from now until the Christmas holidays and somo of tho more important Houso bodies will sit during tho recess. Whon congress reassembles In Janu ary many of the commlttcos will be ready to report bills, and the debates of the winter will begin. Opening of the Senate. Vico-Prestdont Sherman called tho Senate to order at noon. Rev. Ed ward Everett Halo, the chaplain of tho Senate, having died during tha summer recess, his plnco as chaplain, temporarily waB taken by a local clergyman who offered prayer. In the Sonato tho roll was called and It was found that nearly all tho Senators wcro In their scats. The resolutions were adopted to tho effect that com mittees bo appointed to Inform the House and the president that tho Sen ate had assembled and was ready to begin the business of tho session. As was the caso in the Houso many bills wero Introduced for consideration dur ing tho winter by sonators who, like tho representatives, desire to hnvo a hand in forwnrdlng administration pol icies. After a comparative short session "in tho open," tho galleries were cleared and the Sonato went Into ex ecutive session behind closed doors for tho purpose of considering nomina tions for offlco sent to tho Uppor Houso by President Taft. A Question to Be Considered. "Do you consider plagiarism permis sible under any circumstances?" "Well," answered Senator Sorghum, "It's pretty hard when you find your self compelled to mnko a cholco be tween being Interesting or original." Moral Bread of Mankind.

Tho prosldcnt trans mitted tho following messngo to con gress: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: Tho relations of tho United States with til forolgn governments hnvo continued upon tho normal basis of nmlty and good understanding, nnd aro very genernlly satisfactory.

From vntloun qunrteis, directly or Indirectly concerned, tho Intermediation of tho Uni ted States wns sought to assist In 11 so lution of tho controversy.

My meeting with President Diaz and tho greeting- exchanged on both Ameri can nnd Moxlcnn soil served, I hope, to slgnallzo the closo nnd cardial relations which bo well bind together this republic and tho great republic liincdlatcly to tho south, between which thero Is so vnst a network ot material Interests. I am happy to say that all but ono of the cases, which for bo :jQniXe(ul.,ftUE relatlona with Venezuela hnvo been set tled within tho past few months nnd that, under tho enllghtoncd roglmo now direct ing tho government of Venezuela, provi sion lias been mado for nrbltratlon of tho remaining case beforo Tho llaguo tri bunal. Since tho Washington conventions of 1907 wero communicated to tho govern ment of tho United States as a consult ing nnd ndvlsory party, this government lino been almost continuously called upon by ono or another, and In turn by all of tho llvo Central American republics, to exert Itsolf for tho mnlntonanco of tho conventions, Nearly ovory complaint has been ngnlnst tho Zolayn government of Nlcnrnguu, which hna kept Central Amer ica In constant tension nnd turmoil. Tho responses mado to tho representations of Contral American republics, ns duo from the United States on nccotmt of Its rela tion to tho Washington conventions, have boon at all times conservative and have nvolded, so far ns possible, nny scmblanco of Interference, nlthough It Is vory nppar ont that the considerations of geograph ic proximity to tho canal zono and of tho very substantial American Interests In Contral America give to tho United States a speclaf position In tho zona of theso republics and tho Caribbean sea. J need not rehearse hero tho patient offorts of this government to promote pence nnd welfnro among Uicho repub lics, efforts which aro fully appreciated by tho majority of thorn, who aro loyal to their truo Intorests, It would bo no less unnecessary to rehoarso hero tho nnd tale of unspeakable barbarities and oppression nllegcd to have been commit ted by, tho Zolaya government. Recently two Americans wero put to death by or der of Prosldont Zolaya hlmsolf. They woro ofllcera In tho organized forces of a revolution which was In control of nbout half of tho republic, and as such, according to tho modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they woro entitled to bo dealt with as prlsonors of war. At tho dato when this message Is printed thlH government has terminated diplomatic relations with tho Zolaya gov ernment, for reasons mado public In a communication to tho former Nicaragua charge d'affaires, and Is Intondlng to tako Buch futuro stops as may bo found most consistent with Its dignity, Its duty to American Interests and Its moral obliga tions to Central America and to civiliza tion. 1 Department of State. ' I earnestly recommend to tho fnvor uble consideration of tho congress tho es timates submlttod by tho department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested In tho socrtary of state's letter of this dato, whoreby It will bp posclblo to develop and mnko pormanont tha reorganization of ttio department upon modern lines In a manner to mnko It a thoroughly elllclent Instrument In tho furtherance, of our Torolgn trado and of American Interosta abroad. Tho plan to havo divisions of Lattn-Amerlcan nnd Far-Eastern affairs and to Institute a certain specialization In business with Europe and the near east will at onco command Itself. Thoso polltleo-goograph-Ical divisions and the detail from the diplomatic or consular service to tho department of a number of men who bring- to tho study of complicated prob lems In different paita of the world practical knowledge recently gained on the spot, clearly Is of tho greatest ad vantage to the secretary of state In foreseeing conditions likely to arise and In conducting tho great variety of corru- rpondenca and negotiation. It Bhould bo remombored that such facilities exist In the foreign offices of alt tho leading com mercial nations and that to deny thorn, to tha sccrotnry of stnto would ho to plnco this government nt a great disad vantage In tho rivalry of commercial competition. Tho consular service hns been Im proved under tho law of April B, 1900, and tho executive order of Juno 27, 1W, nnd I commend to your consideration tho question of embodying In n statute tho principles of the. present cxccutlvo order upon which tho eluclcncy of our consular servifco is wholly dependent. Expenditures and Revenues. Pcrhnps tho most important question prcaontcd to this administration Is that of economy In expenditures and sulll clcncy of revenue. Tho deficit of tho. last fiscal year, nnd tho certain deficit of tho current year, prompted congress to throw a greater responsibility on tho oxecutlvo nnd tho secretary of tho treasury than had heretofore been do clnrcd by atntuto. This doolnrntlon Imposes upon tho secretary of tho treasury tho duty of assembling all tho estimates of tho oxecutlvo departments bureaus and olllces of tho expenditures necessary In tho ensuing' fiscal year, and of "malting an estlmato of tho reve nues of tho government for tho same period; and If a probable deficit Is thus shown. It Is mado tho duty of tho presi dent to recommend tho method by which such deficit can bo met. The report of tho socrotary shown that ho ordinary nxpendltures for tho current fiscal yonr ending' Juno 30. 1010. will exceed tho estimated rocolptn by $34,075,020. , It to this doftolt Is ndded tho sum to bo disbursed for tho Pan ama Canal, amounting to 33S.000.000, and $1,000,000 to bo paid on tho public debt, tho deficit of ordinary receipts nnd expenditures "will bo InoreaHod to a total deficit ot f73.07C.020. This def icit tho Hocrotury proposos to meet by tho proceeds of bonds Issued to pay tho cost of constructing tho Panama Canal. I approvo thla proposal. In order to avoid a deficit for tho onmilnK fiscal yoar, I directed tho heads of departments In tho prepara tion of their estimates to malco thorn bb low as possible consistent with Im perative govornmnntnl necessity. Civil Pensions. I am awaro that thero Is a ntronjr fooling In both houscM of congress, and possibly In tho country, against tho establishment of civil pensions, and that thin has naturally grown out of tho heavy burden of military pensions, which It hns vlways been tho polloy of our government to nssumo; but I am Strongly convinced that no other prnctlcal solution of the dlfllcultloH presented by tho superannuation of civil servnntB enn bo found than, that of n system of civil pensions. Frauds in tho Collection of Customs. I regret to refer to tho fnct of tho dlscovory of extonidvo frauds In tho collection of tho customs revonuo at Now York city, In which a number of tho subordinate employcH In tho weigh ing nnd other departments wero di rectly concerned, nnd In which tho beneflclurlcs wero tho Amorlcnn Sugar Hollaing- Company and others. Tho frauds consisted In tho payment of duty on undorwolghtn of sugar. Tho government has recovered from tho American Sugar Refining Company nil ttmt-ttifrnhowjJ.UttUvntfltruA3l od of. The sum was received In full of the amount duo. which might havo boon recovered by civil suit against tho boneftclary of tho fraud, but there waa an express reservation In tho con tract o(f settlement by which tho settle ment s'hould not Interfere with, or prtfi vent tho criminal prosecution of ovory ono who was found to bo subject to tho samo. Criminal prosecutions nro now proceeding- against a number of tho gov ernment ofllcerH. Tho treasury de partment and tho department of Jus tice aro oxertlnff every effort to dis cover all tho wrongdoers. Including tho ofllcers and cmployoH of tho com panies who may havo boon privy to tho fraud. It would soem to mo that an Investigation of tho frauds by con gress nt presont, pending- tho probing by tho treasury department nml tho department of justice, as proposed, might by giving Immunity and other wlno provn an embarrassment In soour ltiK conviction of tho guilty parties. The Tariff Act. Two featurofl of tho now tariff not call for spoclal reference. Uy virtue of tho clause known ns tho "maximum and minimum" clause. It is tho duty of tho oxecutlvo tp consider tho laws and practices of othor countries with reforonco to tho Importation Into thoso countries of tho products nnd mer chandise of tho United States, nnd If tho oxecutlvo finds such laws and prnc tlcos not to bo unduly discriminatory ngalnst tho United States, tho mini mum duties provided in tho bill aro to go Into force. Unless the president makes such a finding, then the maxi mum duties provided In tho bill, that is, an lneroaso of 2f pur cent, ad valo rem over tho minimum duties aro to bo In forco, Koar has been expressed that this power conferred atid duty Imposed on tho executive Is likely to lead to a tariff war. I bog to express tho hnpo and belief that no such result need be anticipated Tho discretion granted to tho oxecu tlvo by tho terms "unduly diner w Inatory" Is wide. In order that the maximum duty shall bo charged nifulnst the Imports from a country. It Is neces sary that ho shall find on tho part of that country not only discriminations In Its laws or the practice under them ngalnst tho trado of tho United States, but that tho discriminations found shall bo undue; th'U Is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was reposed In tho president with tho hopo that the maximum du ties might never b applied In any enso. but that the power to apply thorn would enable tho prusldHiit und tho state de partment through friendly negotiation to secure the elimination from the lnwH and tho practice under them of any foreign country of that which Is un duly discriminatory, No one In seek ing a tariff war or a condition In which tho spirit of retaliation shall bo aroused. Needs of the Navy. Tho roturn of tho battleship fleet from Its voyngo around tho world, In mOro ofllclont condition than whon It started, was a noteworthy eyonl of Interest nllko to our citizens and the naval authorities of tho world. Hooldos tho beneficial atid far-reaching effoct on our porsonul and diplomatic relations In tho countrlos which the fleet visltod, tho marked suo ccsb ofvlhe ships In steaming around the world In all weather In schedule time lias Increased respect for our nay and kHfll has ndded to our nntlonnl prestige- WkaWn Injunctions Without, Notice. Hjl Tho plutform of tUo titlccobsful party In iLI tho last election contained tho following:1 bLI 'Tho Republican party will uphold at HH nil times the authority and integrity of M--WM tho courts, stnto hnd federal, and will' H over Insist that tholr powers to enforce H their process find protect llfo, liberty, BsH and property shall bo prosorved Inviolate.

Tho ends of Juotlco H will host bo mot nnd tho chlof cause of B complaint ngnlnst Ill-considered Injtinc- tlons without notice will bo romovod by H tho enactment ot a statute forbidding iiH hereafter tho Issuing of nny Injunction H or restraining ordor, whether temporary bbbH or pormanont, by nny federal court, iLILH without previous nottco and u rousonablo H opportunity to bo heard on behalf of tho H parties to bo enjoined: unless It shall up- Lslfll pear to tho satisfaction of tho court that tiLiH tho delay necessary to .give such notlco H nnd hearing would result In Iriopnrnblo sLliB Injury to tho complainant and unless also B tho court shall from tho evidence mnko jH a written finding, which shall bo spread H upon the court minutes, that lmmudlato H und trrcpnrablo Injury Is likely to ennuo H to tho complainant, and shall doflno the H Injury, stnto why it Is Irreparable und H shall also ludorso on tho order Issued tho iLLifl dato and tho hour of tho issuance of tho LLLm ordor. Moreover, every such Injunction jH or restraining ordor Issued without pro- JJH vIouh notlco nnd opportunity by tho do- fondant to bo heard should by forco of tho stututo to explro and ba of no ofTcct jmmM nftor seven dayB Xrom tho lsaunnco thoro- ot or within any tlmo less than that po- 'JmmLLA rlod which tho court may fix, unlosa H within tho Injunction or ordor Is ox- jfl tended or rouvwod nftor previous notlco and opportunity to bo heard. H Second-Class Mail Matter. H Tho deficit every yonr In tho post- -J ofltco department la lurgcly caused by tho low rate of postage of ono cent u pound !H charged on sccond-clnsa mall matter, m which Includes not only noWspaporo but mngazlncs und miscellaneous periodicals. Tho actual loss growing out of thu trans- 'H mission of this second-clans innll matter H nt one cent a pound amounts to nbout H $03,000,000 n year. Tho average cost of tho H transportation of this matter Is more than ,IH nine couts n pound. It appears that tho avorago distance ov- 'iftiLH or which nuwspapers nro dcllvored to liiLH their customern Is 91 miles, while tho jH averago haul of magazines Is 1,019, nnd of miscellaneous periodicals 1.12S miles. jH Thus, tho avorago haul of tho maguzluo fkmkm Is three und ono-half times nnd that of ILiH tho miscellaneous periodical nearly four fl times tho haul ot tho dally nowspaper, yet jH all uf them pay the samo postage rnto of fl opo cent a pound.
