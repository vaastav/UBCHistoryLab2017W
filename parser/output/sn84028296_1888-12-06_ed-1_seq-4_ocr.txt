It con tains much valuable news matter and adver ting, together with an exhaustive review of the President's message, which deserves enre fnl reading. JSTIndiana's official vote gives Harrison a plurality of 2,348. iWhen Mr. Cleveland retires from the White House he will be 62 years old. J3JDe mocratic principles are right, and like the eternal truth of God, will ultimately prevail. EP"Gen. Harrison's father-in-lnw has held a government office all through President Cleveland's term. JjThe prohibition amendment to the constitution of Virginia was snowed under by a majority of 40,000. "Cleveland has over 80,000 majority of the popular vote, the Signal notwithstanding to the contrary. This is over 18,000 more than he had in 1884. ISTThe Garrett (Ind.) Clipper remarks that the Democratic party is still doing busi ness at the old stand and after a furlough of four years orders will again be taken for post offices, clerkships, etc J3?"Mr. E. Strone Wiggins, the wild weath er prophet of Canada, is just now swollen to the bursting point with indignation, because he has been elected an honorary member of the Boston Ananias Club. tyThe Democrats of Ohio at the late elec tion carried thirty-live of the eighty-eight counties by majorities averaging 1,120 each. They gained over their vote of four years ago in every county in the State, and made net gains in thirty-three counties. JStfTA Republican in Wellsborough, Pa., illuminated his house because of the recent victory. His wife, however, is a Democrat, to she closed one blind on each window of the domicile to show that one-half the firm didn't sympathize with the demonstration. ESTThe Republicans assassinated the last President they placed in the White House, because he failed to satisfy their greed for office. They are likely to serve the one they have just elected the same way, and the coon try again be disgraced by the villainous act. Blaine was the prime cause of the murder of Garfield. He may play the same part with the new Republican President. SSTfte- newspapers which are assigning John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, to the po sition of the Secretary of the Treasury under Mr. Harrison are not veil informed. Mr. Wanamaker, undoubtedly raised and turned more money into Quay's campaign treasury than any other man in the country, but he is an importing merchant and hence cannot hold the position to which he has been as signed without sacrificing his big store, which bow covers a ten acre lot. 1 JStTThe Democratic plurality in this Con gressional district on the candidate for Sec retary pf State, which it will be remembered was the head of the State ticket, was 015, and yet a Republican candidate for Congress is elected by 94. It's a burning shnme nnd a reflection on the consistency of Democrats and their loyalty to party principles'. We have a Democratic district, yet the Republi cans are sending a Representative to Con gress. We meekly bow our heads in shame. -l'avlding Democrat. THE 

DEMOCRATIC NORTHWEST. JSf Republicans hive great love for sol diers and their widow, maimed soldiers es pecially. Or at tant tlirf pretend to have that great love, but generally when position or spoils are concerned, the soldier or his widow don't count any more than the usual run of mankiud. A maimed soldier is now holding tho position as postmaster of Na poleon, and his commission won't expire until probably a year after the Republican President is inaugurated. Many question whether he will be allowed to serve oat his time, and no one believes he will be reap pointed, although, remember, be is n one armed soldier! Also, a soldier's widow i holding the position as deputy under the above named postmaster. Now, will this great love (?) the Republicans have for the widows of soldiers allow them to even retain this dependent widow in the position she now occupies, or give her any other position? We have our doubts, and believe they are well ta ken when we look over the hungry horde of place-seekers brought to the surface through the election of Harrison President. If the Republicans wish to test this love for the soldier, or practice what they preach, let them re -appoint the present maimed soldier and the soldier's widow. And if they can't do this, let a maimed soldier of their own choosing be made p. m., and a widow, equal ly deserving as the present incumbent, be made deputy! Will the Republicans do this? Their past record answers "No!" JSTThe law provides that the trustees of any township, when notified in writing that Canada thistles are about to go to seed on any land within their township, shall cause the thistles to be destroyed in time to pre vent the seed from spreading, and make re turn in writing to the board of county com missioners, with their bill of expenses and charges. The bill, when duly audited, is to be paid ont of the county funds, and the amount is then entered on the tax duplicate against the land on which the thistles were destroyed. The owner, lessee or agent of the land must, however, be notified in writing by some one interested, not less than five days before the cutting of the thistles is done by the trustees. The law also provides that the "owner, occupier or possessor" of land on which Canada thistles are allowed to go to seed shall be fined $20. ' J3fWhile the Congressmen from the North vary in fortune from $30,000,000 down to practically nothing at all, the Southern mem bers are all comparatively poor. The riohest Southern member in the House of the Fit tieth Congress is Nathan Goff, of West Vir ginia, Republican candidate for Governor of that State at the late election. The only Southern members who reach $100,000 are Governor McCreary, of Kentnoky, and Gen erals Bankhead and W. H. F. Lee, of Alaba. ma. The former is a farmer and both had Borne of their fortunes left from fine estates, before the war. The opposition of the trusts and other big capitalistic concerns of the North to legislation coming from the South is due to the fact, that Southerners being poor seek means to curtail the extraordinary absorption of national wealth by these con cerns. SAn exchange says that the editor of the Ohio Farmer has been going through the statistics of the destruction of sheep by dogs in Ohio, since the law providing for the pay ment of them by the county commissioners has been in operation, or since 1880. In that time there have been 432,820 sheep killed in this State by dogs. Then he falls into philosophizing over it in this way: "Here is a grand total of 432,820 sheep killed and in jured, the value of which was $215,707.45, and every one of which was a dead loss to the wealth of the State. It is safe to assume that there are over 390,030 dogs in Ohio,and it ooBts five dollars a year to feed each one, making an additional dead loss to the State of $1,600, 000 a year, or a grand total of over $13,000, 000 that the dogs of Ohio have cost daring the past eight years. Are they worth it?" ISf-The St. Louis Republic suggests a trib ute to President Cleveland in the following words: "The Democracy of this nation would do itself credit by organizing a great national reception in honor and in admiration of the sterling honesty, indomitable courage, wise statesmanship and unselfish patriotism of the present executive Grover Cleveland. Let this demonstration be held in the sejond week of March, 1889, as he retires from the office in which he served the people so well and faith fully. And, sir, let it be given him in the city of New York, where the traitors accomplish ed their unhallowed work. Let the great heart ot the national Democratic party give expression to its feelings in this manner. It wid be a fitting tribute to a great and trusted public servant, such a one as the Democracy has not known since the days of Jackson." These are our sentiments exactly. S3?"Tohn Culliton, head porter of the Grand Pacific Hotel in Chioago, is worth over $100,- 000, and is said to'be the wealthiest porter in the world. He has been bead porter for a soore of years, being now past fifty years of age. While ho does very little work, aside from announcing trains and giving informa tion, he oan give his brawny young men points on handling big trunks when so dis posed. He is a walking railroad and hotel guide, an amusement bulletin, and about the best city directory Chicago has. The head porters of all the big Chicago hotels are wealthy, and all have their money invested in real estate. tSTMohn Caruth, cotton manufacturer of Philadelphia, has reduced the wages of his employes 10 per cent, since election. James Kerr, who also owns a cotton factory has done the same thing. The Frank Lear Starr mills resumed work Thursday, with a 30 per cent, reduction on wages. Thus, says the Philadelphia Record, "is the seed of tariff re form for future fruitage being sown." tSrTVan Wert Times says: Millionaire Bushnell, of Springfield, O., who wants the next Republican nomination for Governor, told a newspaper reporter that he sent money in this district to help Boothman. Money was also sent from Cincinnati into Paulding county for the same purpose. The size of the corruption fund that was raised to defeat Mr. Saltzgaber would, if made known, cause pnblio wonder. One Bryan saloon keeper was offered $150 if he would support Boothman, and $50 ad ditional if he would induce a certain other Democrat to do likewise. One man at Mont pelier was offered $0 to support Boothmnn. Doubtless other influential men were offered similar sums to support Boothman. It is no torious that at two or three polling plnces voters were bought at prices ranging from $2 to $5 each. An effort to punish one of the vote merchants failed by one vote to pass the grand jury.

Ail other dead beets take warning. Opinion is divided as to whether it is a hoax, intended to frighten the shiftless into a bet ter mode of living, or whether there aotnally is a White Cap organization in our vicinity. Fostoria Dispatch. Ii7The rotten borough of Nevada cost in 1876, 19,691 votes; in 1880, 18,343; in 1884, 12, 771; in 1888 about 10,000. Here is a loss of nearly 150 per cent, of the total vote of the State in twelve years and the decrease is con stantly going on. This shows that Nevada, with less than one-fourth of the votes cast in the city of Cleveland, is represented in Con gress by two United States Senators and one Representative. It shows that the Republi can party will control both branches of Con gress by reason of the three representatives of that insignificant rotten little wart. Those Republicans who have been howling about the nnequal representation from certain southern States would do well to turn their attention for a moment to Nevada. Plain Dealer. J35TUnder the present partisan Republican gerrymander in Ohio there are at least 250, 000 Democratic voters who are to all intents and purposes disfranchised.

It beoomeB our aad duty to chronicle the death of another pioneer of Flatrook townahlp. in the perion of Jacob Lnmhardy. who was born February ihaid, 188. and died Nov. S6'h. WS, aged 66 jreara, 9 miutha and 4 daya. The deceased waa a native of Kiaenbangh, Germany, he and his companion hav ing emigrated to America In the year 1KM and lo cated in Tuncsrawas County, Ohio, and remained at that place about four years ; then moved to Heury Oounry, Flatrook township, where he departed this life. He was married to Elizabeth Lowcry in his native country in '810; they lived together In the bonds of n atiimuDy until 1877, when his compan ion departed this life. Since that time until the day he died his grand daughter kept house for him. To theee parents were born 8 children 4 sons and 4 daughters, one child was buried in his native coun try, while five are sleeping tu the Florida cemetery beside father and mother. He waa more or les af flicted with disease for a number of years, but was only coutined to his bed for about 12 weeks when he passed away. H was confirmed and became a member of the (ierman Reformed Church at the age of 14 years, and lived a worthy member until he de parted this life. During his illners he epoke of death as a welcome visitor and longed to go to that home where they know no sorrow. He loved to read God's Word, aud lifted hie heart to God in prayer as long as he had strength to do so, and when his departure waa near at hand be tried to ar range matters for tbe future, took his little grand daughter by the hand aud raid, he a good girl and bid the friends good bye, I can't stay any longer with you. Thus one a'ter another these lights have gone ohi of this fan ily but may all ne rebuilt again in Heav en. M ay all who were present on ihis occasion re member the funeral text delivered on the oocaalon by the Rev. rtheplcy, pastor in charge, from the words of the 1st chapter ol Fblllpians and the 2 lrd verse : ''For I am in a ttrait betwixt two hivlng a desire to depart and be with Ohriatls far better." The fun ral took place from the German Reformed Church, at Florida, Ohio, where a large congrega tion gathered and followed the remains to the ceme tery at Florida, and there laid beside his companion and children to await the resurrection morn. Hay the Ureat Comforter sustain the two that are left and ultimately bring them all to meet again be yond the river. Our father and mother are gone and we are left, The loss of them to mourn, But may we hope to meet with them With Christ before tne throne. J. W. Save your change for Curtis' Bazar goods.
