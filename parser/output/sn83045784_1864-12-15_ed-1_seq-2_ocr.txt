NATIONAL 1NTELL1GEN0ER. CONDITIONS OK POLITICAL I'NITV. Id the comuunts with which wc accompanied the publication of the President'* message on \\ cd oesday last We stated that Mr. LtxcoLN had no new or more explicit view* to announce with re gard to the terms uf pcaoe or the conditions of UnioD- resulting lVow his sevetfll proclamations on the subjeot of slavery and of amnesty. While re fc&rming that the Southern people " can at any ' mom en t hare peace ?umply by laying down their '' arms and submitting to thi- national authority * under the Constitution," ho immediately sub joined that? ? la presenting iUo abandonment ot aituoU rosist&nco to ise national authority on the part of tie insurgents as the cniy indispensable condition to ending the war on the part ,;f the Government, 1 retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery I repent the declaration made a rear ago, that ? while 1 remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor lhall I return to slavery any person who is tree by tho terms ol that proclamation, oroy any act of Congress in the presence of such declarations we ventured ike prediction that " radical" and " conservative" supporters of the President would be equally sa listicd with his position, and would equally claim tbfit he ha.H fully identilicd himself with them and their views. We felt sura that radicals would bring the latter of these declarations into promi nent relief while ignoring the former, and that conservatives would give special prominence to the tonner while ignoring the latter. Or, if cach recog nised the existence of both of the correlated passages, we felt sure that the one party would resolve the Hinbiguity of the President's declarations by ex plaining away one of the passages, while the other party would resolve the ambiguity by explaining sway the other parage. What we anticipated has been abundantly confirmed by the different inter pretations which the document has received from the !tto win^s of the Republican army. As the representative of the conservative wing U this party, we may select the subjoined exposi tion! of the message under this head by the New York Time.*. It says : " The most salient feature iu tb?* menage* is tLr em plfctic declaration of the President that he recognises but one single oonditiou of peace, and that the return of rebels cc their allcgiance. lie says : ? They can at any time have peace simply l?y laying down their arm* and submitting to the national authority under the Constitution.' The Pr? iideot neither insists upon nor looks for auy stipulation in stance in respect to the abandonment of slavery. His only claim is for an .abandonment cf armed resistance. This make* good precisely what we Lave contended was the true construction of the famous missive, ' To whom it say concern.' It puts beyond further dispute the Presi dent. ? absolute singleness of purpose, and his determina tion to maintain the war solely on a constitutional basis tor constitutional ends It is true that he takes occasion here to repeat that he will not attempt either to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation. Yet in this he ii perfectly consistent. That proclamation was a v,ar iaeasure, nutboriied by tte war power involved in the doty prescribed to the .Executive Ly the Constitution to enforoe the law?. Its operative force must cootioue while jht war leit/i When the war ceases, itsell must cease &? a war measure. It can Lave no further continuing effect, chough the effect already consummated, whatever the courts may decide tbat to be, cannot be undone, and must remain cucnarged. 'i be President holds to the proclamation in just the right manner. He treats it as au instrument of war, hut in do way interposes It against peace. 'Ihe re bels can get peace at any time without touching it. A.U tbat is required of them is that; they shall in good faith tow t' tto Ccuitilution." On the other hand, the Mew York Tribune, whioh will be univeisally accepted us an exponent gf the radical wing of the Republican party, inter prets the message in a precisely opposite sense. It says : " For himself the President leWacts nothing he has ever ii d or done in regard to slavery. He will not retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor will he ever return to bondage a human being freed by tbat proclama tionor by acts of Congress He stys emphatically that if the people make such an act an executive duty tbey must tzi somebody use to perform it " Such are tho important points of the message, and not rt,sr. tht moet nolent eppontnt of Mr. Lincoln can complain thai his policy ttas an uncertainly about U, or that it is not thoroughly radical at his warmest admirer veoiild hune : Peace by tte submission or conquest of rebels, and the total aboUuon of sluiery, will be the determined purpose of tee new Administration. The country Las sanat'oned ?d will accept the policy Id order to place the nuiu^viiittio views ul' the two wing6 of the RepubUcaD'pany on tins subject id a clear light the Tribune in its number of Thurt Jay last administers to the New York Times the following rebuke for its contradictory opinions on t. subject as to which " not oven the moat violent opponent of Mr. Lincoln can domplain that bis policy has any uncertainty about it." It nays: ' I t?

But, assuming the truth ol this statement in *11 it.- paft*, ?c should think that the labor of the Times would cxcitc commiseration in the heart of its political eoniederatc; for, if the " stream of the President's good sen e and good faith" ir us "dear" as the Tribune represents it, the tark of " strnining" it through even the moat delicate of " oolandcra" can serve only to revive in classical minds the unhappy fate of the daughters of Banaus, in the old heathen mythology, doomed us they were evermore to pour limped water into a vessel full of holci? which was ever filling but never filleU. As the Times, however, supposes itself to have retained at the bottom of its oolander a residuum which to its eyes bears the appearance of being both "good sense and gocd faith," we must adopt the conclusion that the Presidential uticatu is either cot a* clear as the Tribune supposes, or that one .1 the other of our intelligent oontemporaiiee is inangnly at fault in the filtering process to nhich *acij subjects the President's message in a way to 1 still from it a precisely opposite sense. We do not refer to this conflict of opinion with ?ny invidious purpcie. We seek simply to know which of the two contradictory interpretations of message i? correct that we may regulate our own conduct accordingly. We have already stated that we accept a full identity with the New York Times ?n its views as to the relations of slavery to the war. Are we to understand that its views are tboee of th?. President, or that the Tribune is right *0 molding such views to be nothing better than sedi ment l raped from the bottom of Mr. 8eward's -dander ? The answer to this question is of prac? kicat "importance, seeing that the President in bis UiC^age cftli.i ou all wliu voted againat him to waive their individual opinions and be unanimous with the Administration. To this effect he says : " Iil a great national crisis like ours unanimity of action among those seekiug a common end is very desirable, al most indispensable. And yet no approach to auoti unani mity is attainable uuless some deference shall be paid to tbe will of the majority, simply because it i* the will of the majority." It is olviou- that there can be on the part of the political opponents of the Administration no such " unanimity of action " as the President desi derates until the political friends of the President shall come to some agreement with regard to the meaning of the message in what the Times call* its u most salient feature " When the Tribune aays that t,here is " no uncertainty" about this feature, while combatting the view which the Times takes of it, who docs not see that the plainest considera tion of prudence must impose on the opponents of the Administration a measure of caution in the premises, lest, in their anxiety to be unanimous with it.i supporters, they should tind themselves at cross purposes with their honest intentions to be what the Administration would have them to be, and to do what the Administration would have them to do r Unity ot' thought and simplicity of purpose on the part of the Administration are essential prerequisites tn unanimity of action oa the part of the people. 1 ROM THE 

ARMY OF THE POTOMAC. Central Wurrtn i Expedition?Fight at Hatcher's Run?Rebili Driven Off?Their World Taken. Hatch lr's Kin, Ijeckmbkh 9,16C4. Early t n Wednesday morning an expedition consisting t>l Griffin's and Crawford's divioiona of the Fiftti Corps, Mott's of tli^ Second, and Gregg's cavalry, the whole under command of Gen Warren, left camp and moved off in the direction of 8tony Creek atation, on the Weldon railroad, where (report stated) it had #one for tbe purpose of com pleting the destruction of the branch railroad from that point to the Southaide road, and doing such other injuries to the rebel interests in 1 hat vicinity as time and circum stances might permit. A formidable force of straggler* bioughl up by tha cavalry last night reported that they were unable to cross, owiug to the fact that the pontoon bridge had been taken up immediately after tbe crossing of the main oclumn, which when laet heard from bad encountered no opposition and was moving rapidly lorward A reconpoissance was sent out noun alter dail. last even jog consisting of the 3d Pennsylvania and portions of the K'.th and fcth Ohio cavalry, under command of Col. V inton of tbe 12th, wbo had orders to reconnoitre in tbe vicinity of Hatcher's Run. Soon after leaving our pickets encoun tered those of the enemy, who gradually tell back to the run, to which our caralry advanced on the Vaughn road, but finding tbe enemy posted in superior numbers withdrew to their former cantonments. Early this morning, however, the same mounted lorce wan again dispatched down the Vaughn road toward the run, followed by Gen. Miles's division of the Second Corps. But little opposition was encountered until the ford on Vaughn road was reached, where tbe enemy was found in considerable numbrrs. Skirmishing immediately began, and an attempt to croes was soon essayed by tbe cavalry, but did not i?ucceed, owing to 1 he fact that the run had been dammed below tbe road, making it at least live feet deep. Reside this, trees had been placed across the ford, rendering a crossing still more difficult. Tbe infantry soon afteruarJs came up, and the brigade of Gen. Marcy wan thrown to the front, with orders to eliect a crossing. Deploying tbe 140;h New York as skirmishers, Gen Marcy advanced toward the run. The 2d New York heavy artillery was scon after pushed forward, and ordered to effect a crossing at all hazard*. The regiment was commanded, by Mejor Hogg, whose conduct, together with that of Capt Ames of the same regiment, is especially commended by Gen. Miles. Plunging in the stream on horseback, Msjor n< gg reached the centre of tbe run, leadiog his regiment, when, bis horse getting tangled against tbe fallen trees, be dismounted and finally gained the opposite bank, followed by bis command, wbo charged and drove tbe enemy from his works. The cavalry soon after effected a crossing at Armstrong's ford, further down, and immediately pursued the enemy to Gravelly run, several milea beyond the ford, where they rest to-night. Gen. Miles's headquarters are at theCommings House, within a mile of the lord, and bis troops are bivouacking near tbe run. The enemy's line at Hatcher's Run was a weak one, and, prisoners state, was composed of dismounted cavalry. Their works, however, were formidable, and, had they been defended determinedly, our loss would have been much greater. Tbe One Hundred and Fortieth New York sus tained the greatest loss, as it occupied tbe skirmish line, and for some time was hotly engaged with the enemy. About thirty men of tbe regiment were killed and wounded during the skirmish Two men of the Second New York Heavy Artillery were drowned in attempting to cross the run, and several were wounded by the aharp*hooter? of tbe enemy. Tbe casualties in cavalry were trilling. KM i tiW <-i 1JIK EXPEDITION?THE WKLDoN RAILROAD DESTROYED Jll.AbQL'ARTERS ARMY or TUE POTOMAi, Sunday, Dtcembtr 11, 13?4. 'lie i.ivVmucliU iu ttnH department, which have been iii course of eiecutou the past few days, Lave finally been developed, and now tbe objecta intended to be accomplished may be given to tbe public, ax well aa tbe results attained. It was known that tbe enemy were procuring large sup plies for their troops bj way of tbe Weldon railroad to Stony Creek, whence they were wagoned to Petersburg. Tbe cavalry force sent thither teD days ago not being able to effectively stop their operations, tbe Fifth Corps, with Gregg s cavalry and tbe third division of tbe Seoond Corps, were detailed to effectually stop it, by destroying the rail road as far aoutb m Qichsford. At daylight on Wednesday monui>? tbe column starM ?outb on tbe Jerusalem road, the cavalry taking tbe ad vhiice. On arriving at a point nineteen miles from Peters burg they diverged from the r-.ad about a mile to the right, where they reached tbe Nottaway river, and the command at once commenced crossing , and they bivouacked on tbe sonth side fct the night. At hall past seven o'clock on Thursday morning the pontoons were taken up, and the column started, leaving a cavalry detachment to pick up stragglers and return with them On reaching a point two nules beyond Sussex Court House some cavalry were encountered, and were driven back to where the Weldon ia<lroad crosses the Nottaway river. About noon a small force of tbe enemy made a dash between our cavalry and the advance ol the iufantry, but were soon routed, with slight loss on both sides. The ad vance then commenced the destruction of the railroad by burning the bridge across the Nottaway river, and conti nued on to Jarrett's Station, bivouacking at tbat place on Thursday night. On Friday morning an early start was uiade, and in the afternoon the adrance reached a point near llicksford, where tbe enemy were found to be in some foroe, and hav ing a battery in position, with stroDg works on both sides of the Meherrin river. After the position had been exam ined, an attack was deemed impracticable, on account of the works, and the difficulty of approaehing them, particu larly with artillery. Therefore it was determined to carry the line of works on this fide and destroy tbe depot, which was successfully done. During this cbargeCol. (orMalor) Sargent, of tbe lit Massachusetts, is said to have been kill ed. Troops were seen moving into position at this point, as though they had just arrival, and the lire from tbe bat teries soon after showed that tbey bad been reinforced. It was now dark, and began raining.snowing, and freezing, Tbe troops encamped in the vicinity for the night, and in tbe morning started on their return, reaching Husset Court-bouse, and halting there on Saturday night. Tbe enemy's cavalry and a small force of infantry followed, but each time were driven back with loss. This afternoon the Nottaway river was reached, and tbe entire command crossed in safety, where tbey found a part ot the Ninth Corps who had started o their aid In case of an engaged men'. Tomorrow tbergwill be all back to their o,Id posi tu.ns m front of Petersburg, ready for tbe uert move aga>cst the enemy, in whatever direction tbe commander in-chief may deem most effectual. The move may be considered one ol tb? most successful ol tbe campaign, and reflects bouoi not only on tbe origi nator but on tbose to whom its execution waa entrusted. A most effective blow has been dealt the enemy by tbe destruction of some fi I teen miles ol railroad, which they were uaing extensively, some one hundred cars passing over it daily loaded with supplies, 'i be track was torn up, the ties piled in heaps with dry wood from tbe adjacent fences and set on fire, with the rails on top, tbe beat bending ami twisting them in every ahape All the depots along tbe route were destroyed, ns well as numerous mills, barns, and dwellings from which tbe ocsupant* bad fled, or from the cover of which guerrillas bad fired on our troops Our loss in the entire trip will not exceed forty or fifty killed and wounded, besides a few stragglers who were captured The severity of tbe weather was tbe principal difficulty tbe meti bad tocncouoter, but aa there was much wood en tbe line of marcb; and plenty of work for them to do, tbey managed to keep themselves from suffering se verely on tkis aoconnt illii NATIONAL WANK.s Mi M< C'l IJ.OC'IJ, Comptroller of tho Currenoy, l* that during the putt year two huudred aud eighty-two new National Banka have been organized, aud oue hundred Mid sixty-eight State Banka changed into national one*.

"The Legislature of Pennsylvania, following the exam ple of the Legislatures of Massachuretta, Connecticut, A c , has recently authorised the banks of that State to reorganize, and the indication are now unmiatakable that the time ia not far diatant when the people of the United States will lie every where relieved of a bank note eirou lation of limited credit and uncertain value, and aupp'.ied with one of uniform credit and aa solvent as the nation. It hai< been tbe earneat wiah of the Comptroller that thia desirable reault should be brought about through the agency of eiiBting banka rather than by the organization ot new ones, so that the'national circulation might be introduced with as little increase of banking capital aa possible." The> ('ouiph'ullei S'lJn: " It is nu interesting fhct that this great eLatigo is taking plaee?this great financial revolutioo, If I may no rail it, u being accomplished, without disturbing the business of the country, ntate Banks, whose conversions are facili tated by enabling acts, are being daily reorganised without a curtailment of discounts or even a temporary derange ment of their affairs. Nearly all the banking capital of Philadelphia has been recently nationalized with scarcely an interruption of the biuiness of the Banks for a single day. In Htatas where no enabling legislation has been obtained, the change from the Stata to the National system is attended with more difficulty. But even in these Htates, by the organization of National Banks by the stockholders ol State Banks, and tbe transfer of the assets of the latter to the former, the change has been already, in many in stances, effected without loss to the owners, and with very little practical inconvenience to the managers. " It is also an interesting fact that the atook of State Banks which have been changed into national associations has not been depreciated by the change ; on the contrary, the shares of most of them have been appreciated, and 1 know of do instance in which their real or market value has been injuriously affected by it This fact sufficiently refutes the charge, sometimes urged against the system, that it was being forced upon the country to the prejudice of the stockholders of State institutions. " It may be proper for me to state another fact in this connection of interest to the public, which is, that the Na tional Banks are, without aoy known exceptions, in safe, although some of them are in inexperienced hands, and that the fears that the national banking system would be the means of fllliog the couutry with banks of fictitious capi tals, and be a reproduction, on a large scale, of the stock banking systems of States, in which they have proved to be a failure, if not a fraud, are, from present indications, with out a real foundation." Tbe Comptroller remarks that he is instituting a system of examinations which will do much to expose and check improper practices on th? part of tue bankers, and viola tions of the wholesome provisions of the law. Of the bank ing interest generally, be says: " The banking interest of tbe United States is an impor tant one ; it has grown with the business of the country, and has bueti largely instrumental in developing the na tional resources and in increasing tbe national wealth. Banks of issue, badly and dishonestly as many of them have been managed, and disastrous as have been the failures which bad management and dishonesty have produoed, have still been of unquestionable advantage to the people. Tbe capital of tbe country has been largely and id good faith invested in them, and thousands of stockholders de pend upon the dividends upon their bank stock for support. It is an interest which has stood by the Governmeot in its struggles with a gigantic rebellion; and now, wheo it is indispensable that the Government should control the issues of paper money, there has been created a National banking system, not to destroy tbe State Banks, but to absorb them, and that, too, without prejudice to their stockholders." Of the tendency to inflation, he speaks as follows : " But, while the national currency art is restrictive iu its general provisions, and is expected when generally adopted to prevent expansions, there is still danger that too much capital will be invested under it during the suspen- i sion of specie payments, and in the existing unsettled oon- 1 dition of our political and financial affairs. Wheu money, is plenty, and fortunes are being rapidly acquired, tbe 1 country is always in a feverish and unhealthy state. This is especially true at the present time. The enormous ex penditures of the Government, aLd the great advance in i prices since the commencement of tbe war, have made i many persons suddenly rich, and upou fortunes suddenly acquired have followed reckless expenditures, extrava i gance, waste Speculation is taking tbe place of sober and persevering iudustry, and thousands are deluded with ibe notion that the wealth of tbe nation is being increased by the increase of its indebtedness. The inauguration of a new system of banking, under such circumstances, is pe culiarly hazardous, and I have been, from tbe time of my appointment, more apprehensive that too many banks would be organized than that the system would not be suf ficiently attractive to induce capitalists to beeome con nected with it. 1'be Government is the great borrower. Its obligations compose a large portion of the disoount line of the banks, which are raskicg large profits on Govern ment secuuties at little apparent risk, and the danger is, that the national banking system, with all its restrictions, may, duting the suspension of specie payments, and the cont.nuance of the war, add to tbe plethora of paper mo ney ; and that, when the war is over, tbe banks, deprived of the existing means of investment in Government obliga tions, and finding no legitimate una for their capitals, may be tempted to Hue them in encouraging operations that will eventually prove to be as unprofitable to themselves as they will be injurious to the country. For the double pur pose, therefore, of keeping down tbe national circulation as far as it has seemed possible to do it, consistently with the establishment of the system throughout the country, and preventing an increase of bankiug capital, that might hereafter be instrumental in keeping up tbe inflation and retarding the resumption of specie payments, or prove un profitable to its owners, 1 have felt it to be my duty to discourage, In many instances, tbe organization of new banks, and io more instanoes to refuse my sanction to the increase of the capital of those alteady organized In do ing so I may seemed to have exercised a power not war ranted by the act; but, if not sustained by its letter, I bave besen by its spirit, and I am willing to let the future decide as to the correctness or incorrectness of my oonrse " " But while I entertain tbe opinion that the currency of tbe country is already too much expanded, and that it would be a calamity if the national banking system should be the means of materially increasing it, I must not be understood as sanctioning tbe notion, no generally prevalent, that the high price of coin is to be altogether or chiefly attributed to it. or that gold and silver are, at tbe present time, the standard of vaiuo in the United States. When gold sold in Wall street, on tbe 1st of July last, r.t one eighty-five premium, many or the best stoeks, as well as productive real estate, were no higher tban they have been upon a coin basis. " By referring V> the gold market In New York during tbe past three years, it will be perceived that Its value has been regulated by other causes than tbe inflation of the currency. Id January, 1862, gold In New York was at a premium of one and cue half per cent It soon fell to one, ttoui which it rune, ou lUo 10tu of October, to timi/seven, aud closed, on tho 3 J it of December, at thirty-four. Ou tbe 21 tb of February, IM?3,it bad advtuioed to seventy two aud one-ball; but on the 26th of March (favorable uews having beeu received from Ibe Southwest) it went down to forty and one-half, but, in twelve days, ou the receipt of lens favorable intelligence from that quarter, it weot up to fifty-nine aud one half. A few daya after, upon the report of the irou-cliid attack upon Fort Sumter, it fell to forty six, and on receipt of the intelligence of the surrender of Port Hudson to tweuty three and one-half. Ou the 15th of October it rose to fllty-four, but reached uo higher point duriug tbat year. Ou tbe 1st of Jauuary, 1864, it open ed at fifty-two, weut up to eighty-eight on tbe 14th of April, and fell to 67 on the l!)th of the same month. On tbe paiaage of tbe gold bill, June 22, it roae to 130, and fell the next day to 115. Ou the 1st of July it waa foreed up to 185, but on the day following (the gold bill having been repealed) it fell to 130. On the 11th of the aame month it went up again to 1 84; on the 15th it fell to 144, and after various fluctuations dropped on the 26th of Sep tember to 87?thus rising beiweeu the 1st of Jauuary and tbe 1 at of July, 1864, from 52 to 185, aud falling between the 1st of July and tbe 26th of September fromJ86 to 87. None of these fluctuations were Drought about by an in crease or decrease of tbe currency; ou the contrary, gold rose the most rapidly when there was no considerable in crease of the currency, and fell in the face of large addi tions to it. Nothing oan be more conclusive of the inoor reotness of the opinion that gold is always the standard of value, and that tbe high prioe it has commanded in the United States during tbe progress of the war is the result of an inflated currency, than this brief statement of its va riations in tbe New York stock market." ? Amendments of the currency act are recommended, iu order that it may be fully accommodated to tbe wants and business of the country. The Comptroller says: " Tbe provisions in regard to the lawful money reserve and the distribution of tbe assets of insolvent banks require modfioation. " 1 am still of the opinion that the rates of interest to be charged by the National Banks should be fixed by Congress, and not by the States. " There are too many points at which the banks may re deem their notes. All, with tbe exception of those in Philadelphia and Boston, should redeem iu New York. The banks ought to be compelled by law to retain a part, if not all the coin received by them, for interest on their gold bearing bonds, in order that they may be prepared to lend their influence in iavor of a return to specie payments; and some provisions should be introduced by which, when specie payments ure resumed, excessive importations of goods may be cheoked, and dangerous exportations of coin may be prevented. " It is of the greatest importance that the national cur rency system should be independent of politics, and freed from political influences. To effect this, and to facilitate the business of the banks with the Comptroller, I am clearly of the opinion that the Bureau should be made au independent department, aud removed from Washington to Philadelphia or New York." 

DISCHARGE OP THE ST. ALBANS' RAIDERS. Montreal, December 13, 1BC4. TLo ctiMo ul lie St. Albans' raiders wa* reopened to day before Justice Coursal The court-room was well fillfd witL spectators. The appearance of tbe prisoners wan much the tiaine as at the last hearing. At the commencement of tbe proceedings Mr. Kerr ob jected tint the court Lad no jurisdiction in tbe case. He denied in lolu hi* honor's right to sit there at all on this investigation. Mr. Derbiu en;J that, alter Laving granted a delay of a mouth, they bad now met to hear evidence for the de. fence, and not to listen to a legal argument. After h few words from tbe Court, and from Mr. John son, Queen's counsel? Mr. Kerr was allowed to go iuto au argument as to the jurisdiction < f tbe court in (he premises, and after some discussion between tbe counsel, the Court said that this was a matter of most grave importance, involving hia right of jurisdiction, and, consequently, the validity of these proceedings f rom the commencement. He should, there fore, take time to consider it before proceeding further, and for this purpose the court would adjourn until 3 P. M. The Court reassembled at three o'clock, and was dense ly crowded. Justice Covrsal, on taking the bench, said tbe matter in question was most important, since bis au thority had been denied. He had given the argument od both sides his most serious consideration, and had come to tbe conclusion that tbe ease came under the imperial aot, and that he was bound to aot and to obey the imperial au thority. In a national question, like the one under consi deration, tbe imperial act was supreme, and must be his guide. Our own provincial act to carry into effect tbe Ashburton treaty had not received the special royal sanc tion requisite.. Tbe oaie was a most exceptional one, and being national be could do no other than allow our own act to give way before that of the Imperial Legislature. The revised imperial act must rule herein, and that aet re quired that tha warrant under which the prisoners were Arrested should be signed by tbe Governor General. It the court could have teserved the point for a higher tribu nal it would most gladly have done so, but since the liberty of the subject was involved there admitted of no delay, and since he bad not had the warrant of the Governor General, he had come to the coneluiion that the court possessed no jurisdiction in the case, and he must order the immediate release of tbe prisoners. This announcement wa? received with applause by a number of persons present, but tbe demonstration was in stantly checked. Mr. Devlin then rose, aud in a uiost impassioned speech implored his Honor not to order the discbarge of the prisoners upon the remaining indictments, but io fair ness and justice to tbe counsel for tbe United States, and for those of tbe private prosecutors, the Banks, to allow of a bearing. He contended that tbe prisoners could be discharged only on this one particular indictment, and tbe court owed it to tbe counsel to be heard on the others. Should it be said in an Eoglish court of justice that tbe Judge bavmg decided in favor of the prisoners in one case, be immediately discharged them in six others, what would be said outside ' Tbe counsel for the defence themselves knew that the course which tbe oourt had taken was un precedented Had not his Honor issued six warrants, and yet he had but one warrant before him. He called solemnly on tbe court to herniate. He (Mr. Devlin) could not retrain silent whilst thirteen men charged with rob bery, and even murder, were allowed to go at liberty without their several cases being investigated. Our good name for justice and fair play was at stake, and though some amongst us might be sympathisers with the pri soners, be bad yet to learu that they set at naught the jewel, fair play. He again called upon tbe court to hesi tale before discharging these men, and give the oounsel for the prosecution ft chance of being beard, for here tbe most important interests of all were at stake, viz. inter national ones. He again implored the oourt not to order this wholesale delivery. He would put it to the oourt, was it treating tbe counsel for the prosecution with fair ness? If the court should peraist in doing this, then we must he prepared for the consequences. No country bad dealt fairer with England in extradition matters than had the United States. Their Judges combined to give effect to the extradition treaty. The Judges of our Supreme Court bad concurrent jurisdiction with his Honor, and bad counsel known of tbe probable course of his Honor, they would have desired the court to allow these Judges to have teats on the bench with him. Mr. Johnson rose and said that both those who repre sented tbe United States and those who represented pri vate interests in this affair had upon them a grave responsi bility, but he thought Mr. Devlin mistaken in the view which he took of the judgment of tbe oonrt. The court meant that tbe prisoners were discharged on the one charge which had been investigated. The Court here said that Mr. Devl'n bad understood the judgment of the court aright. The prisoners were dis charged in every case before him. Messrs. Kkrk, Abbott, and LArLAMME, oounsel for the prisoners, objected to any calling in question of tbe jodgmeot. Mr. Rose, counsel for tha United States, wished to speak. He ?aid he did uot mean to call his Honor's judg ment just delivered in question. The Court declined to bear further, paying that if be bad no right to arrest these men on one charge, at he held that he had not, then neither had be the right to detain tbem on any others. These men had been arrested on magistrates' warrants upon bis own motion, and then on motion of tbe police, and now when bis Honor's own juiis diction was called in question becauae his warrants were null and void, he saw be had been mistaken, and it was tbe duty of every British judge, on finding that, to rectify his errors. The Court ordered, therefore, that tbe prisoners be im mediately diacharged, and was prepared to incur tbe re sponsibility of its own acts Applause again broke out m the court, but was again instantly cheeked. In a few minutes the prisoners walked through the court room and were congratulated by a few of their acquaint ances ; and when tbey emerged from the building a few voices were raised in something meant to be cheers. They then separated, looking pleased at their enlargement, and the crowd at once dispersed. Toronto, Dr.rr.MHER 13, 18G4. Tie Lake Erie raiders were again before the court to dsy, aud discharged on tbe ground that tbe oourt bad no jurisdiction, Tbe result causes much excitement. gBuHi.AbK Runner Destroyed.?The blockade run ner Ells, with an assorted cargo Of arms and ammunition, was so jloeely pursued by tbe Federal steamess that aba was run asb?rs. under tbe guns of the Confederate batteries, when ahe was destroyed by an expedition from the United States steamer Emma. <M) NGRESS, t XTKACTS FROM THE DAILY REPORTS.
