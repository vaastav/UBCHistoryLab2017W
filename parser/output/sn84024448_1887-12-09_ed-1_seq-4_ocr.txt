THE EIGHTH OF JAXUAllY. Tho Jackson Club, a Democratic or ganization superior, to anything wo have ever befuie had in Memphis, has signified its puriK.-H to celebrate tho nnnivcrsiuy of tin! great victory won by Jackson and his veterans from Tennessee at New Orleans on the Kth of January, lsU. It ia a happy foi-elhullght. Tho people of Tennessee, Memphis enviully, huvo left the eulogising of the grout iK'Unarat too long to those of other Nates, and it is ulsnit time that here, in tho city which ho founded and fostered, his praises should I si sung and his eulogy ho ajMikon, ami Dcmocrala should Ui gathered from all tho Stales of tho Union to renew, around tho f est id board, their vovva of fealty to tho princi ples firxt formulated by Jefferson, and so honestly, honorably and irresistibly en forced by "Hid Hickory." No other man after Washington has so im- pressed himself upon our country us Jackson. Ho loved the Kepiiblie with a piuwuomito devotion that was impatient of the presenile of tho Hritinh and the Npnn-i-.li uny w here on this continent. Ho loved the s'ople, mid U'licvod that ours was tho happiest invention in government that the world had ever known. "The I'nion -it must nud shall he pn. served," was tho ex pression nf a railed conviction that it was incomparably tho freest ftnd at tho same time the in.! harmonious form of govern ment that could Is? devised. It was to him the sum of ull human treasures. It was democratic and free and full of inspira tion to In meat men, however circumstanced us to wealth, and to keep it so ho was an oN'ii and avowed enemy of ull forma of inonoiMiK-, und therefore could not bnaik the idea of any con nection lictwocn tho government mid tho business of the country through a bank modeled after Hint of tho lluuk of Cugland. Ho lu Id it, und rightly, to 1e a delusion and a suaro. Individual liWrty, he knew, was tho mainspring of the public well Is ing and well doing, and ho sternly set hia fin e against anything that hsiked likn special legislation. Tho oxtraor- liimry will by dint of which ho achieved so many victories on the Held was tho force that inado hint a dominating (siwer in tho politics of tho country, and nun nf the imxt successful of our Presidents. Ho was a noble mail, a l e of tho American IViiHs-rat at hia Is-st. Ilo was tho tlmt Iicmocrat of his day, and is by all odds the most conspicuous llgtlro iu the history of our Halo. Around him ure grouH'd many great, strong niiliired and ipially bravo and courageous men. Their unniiw should In rescued from ob scurity, and in conjunct ionwilhhis should Ih recalled with ivjoeiiil marks of patriotic favor nud delight on the anniversary of the day when with him they added fresh lau rel to their country's glory. The Jac kson club have done well in taking a first step toward a genuine IVuna ralie revival upon the M of January next. It ia a step that will streiuMlien the public cnnlldeln e ill their organization, and go f ir to reconcile (notion and diiuito, we Iiom, Hi cninilles that have hithertn stood in (be way of union and concord in the party in the city and the Slate. 7: ..! 77 OF

The sad event was tho result of heart diat-aso, and wvurred in t'iiieinnnli, wliere he was iu attendance iimiii the I' nitcd rilntes Piatrict Court, plMsn nt ng the swindling nllln rs of tho Fidelity llank. Mr. Waisoii wnsalawvcr of mmkisl ability, and In the rVroud field oH'iied In him by his olliciat connection with tho Federal linvernmeut made him self felt naa strong ooiitiKlant, a man of ready mind, thoroughly o.piipi-vl in tho law, nud a 1.mi I as a detvut consvrva'.isui would lartuit. Mr. Wataoii was a uativo of Holly Springs, where ho pw to eml neiKv in the pr.wtiivnf Ms piofeasioii and gave (s.hiexl of the Hiion of thone gifts that have won for him the coutl'lciice of AttonieyUener.il Garland and all who wen brought In conUut with him In Washington, whether personally or olll riully. Ilo had reason to ladievo that a great fut ure had opened for him, and Unit, riiMMimg an lio was, It was for sonic putoi of usi'fulniaM greater than hud yet come I.) him. His Stale, just i.ow conspicuous for tho eminent men it has given lo tho aerv liv of tho Republic, had reason to lok lo hint as to one of tho coming men, as to nno who might repre sent her In Senate or Hall, or upon he Is tieh or iu the Cabinet. His death will, then-fore, U to her as a culumiiy, hut to the people who have know u hliu as uiua and boy, the loss wijl nluiostbo Individual. Ifa was so bnilt alLul by their lovo and esteem, their unippct and confldunce, and so cynosurod i A th"ir eyes ns a man who was growing t. itatness. Tub Little Rocls,municiiiul council has passed on ordinance 'making it a misde meanor to sell or give tia minoraclgarette. It is to be hoped Umt this means a tidal wavo of reform wlu'ch is to sweep over tho wholo country, Huch movements aro tho natural results of a henigh Democratic administration. Tlio millennium has 1cen hastened a considerable period .since Mr. Cleveland went into office. The decision of tho Supremo Court in the Virginia bond case checks a tendency on tho pnrt of federul court judges to make light of State courts and State laws. Tho timely and emphatic rcasscrlion of tfto doctrine of iState sovereignty puts an end to ull this. Federal court judges, In the future, will bo us careful in avoiding en croaching ujiou the jurisdiction of State courts as they have Is'en careless to tho contrary iu the pust. ANOTHER TKIUMPH.

It is as follows: "I havo been reading nn abstract of tho President's message, and have been espe cially interested in tho comments of the I-ondon paper. Those paters all assume to declare tho message is a free trade man ifesto, und evidently are anticipating un enlarged market for Knglish fabrics iu tho United Slates as a conscuueuco of tho President's recommendations. Perhaps that fact sIhiiih-(I tho chaructcrof tho mes sage more clearly than any words of tniuo Cllll." , "You don't mean actual free trade with out duty?" queried the reporter. "No," replied Mr. ISlaino. "Nor do the London papers mean that. They simply mean that the President has recommended, w hut iu thu I'uited States is known as a revenuo tariir, rejecting the protective featuro ns an object, und not oven tH-ruiit-ting protection to result freely as fin inci dent to revenue duties." "I don't know that I quite comprehend that lust point," said the reporter. "I mean." said Mr. Pluino, "that for tho first timo in tlio history of the United Mutes the President recommends retain ing thciutcrnul tux in order tlmt tho tariir may bo forced down even Mow tho fair revenuo standard. Ho recommends that tho tax on tobacco be retained, and thus that many millions annually shall lie levied on n domestic product which would far I wttor como from a tar ill' ou foreign hibries." "Then do you mean to imply that you would favor the reiieul of tlio tobacco tux:"' ''Certainly; I menu just that," said Mr. Illaiue. "I should urge that it Is- done at once, even la-foro tho Christmas holidays. It would, iu the first place, bring great re lief to the growers of tobacco all over the country, und would materially lessen tho price of the article to consumer. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The President calls it a luxury, hut it is a lux ury iu no other sense than tea and colfeo nre luxuries. It is well to remember tlmt thu luxury of yesterday I ktoiiics s neces sity of todny. Watch,' if you please, tho number of men nt work on the farm, in tho coal mine, along the railroad, in thu iron foundry, or in any calling, and vou w ill find ninety-five to' UK) chewing while they work. After each meal the same proportion seek tho solace of a pipe or u cigar. These men not only pay tlio millions of the tobacco tax, but pay on every plug und every cigar un enhanced price, which the tax enables tho manufact urer and retailer to impose. Tlio only excuse for such a tax is tlio actual neces sity under which the government found itself during tho war and the years imme diately following. To retuin the tux now in order to destroy tho protection which would incidentally '!ow from raining tho same omount of money on foreign iiiisrts is certainly a tnost extraordinary isilicy for our government." "Well, then, Mr. Ululne, would you ad vise Hie rc'ul of the whisky tux. "No, I woiiI.IhioI. Other consideration Hum tlnxe of tinuncial administration are to be taken into account with regard to whisky. There is a moral side to it. To chcajM-n the price of whisky is to increase tho consumption enormously. There would Is? no sense in urging the reform wrought by hik'h license iu iiuiny Slates if the national government neutralizes the gisal cllect by making w hiskv within reach of everyone at 'M cents a gallon. Whisky would be everywhere distilled if the sur veillance of thu government were with drawn by the remission of tho tax, and illicit sales could not then Im prevented even by a policy as rigorous and searching as that with which Itussia luirsues the nihilists. ' It would destroy digit license at once in all tho Mutes. "Whisky has done a vat deal of harm in tho United State. I would try to muko it do souio gtssl. I would use tlio tax to fortify our cities on tho seslsiurd. In view ol tho Miwerful letter ahn-s-d to tho llenua-rutic party on tho subject of forti Il eal ion by the Into Samuel J. Tilden, in I am nnuised that no attention has Is-en paid to the subject by the laj-mia-ratic administration. Never Is (ore iu tho his tory of the World has uny government al lowed great cities on tho sculssird, like Philadelphia, New York, lloatoii, Haiti more. New Orleans uud Sail Francisco, to remain tlefciiclc." "Hot," said the reporter, "you don't think we nre to have a wnriu any direc tion?" "Certainly not," said Mr. Uluino. "Neither, 1 pn'Siuiie.did Mr. Tilden when he wrote his remarkable letter. Hut we should change a remote chance into an ab solute iuiiKsihility if our weak snd ex-xH-d points were slnmiajy fortified. If to day we had by any chaui-e even such a war na we had with Mexico, our enemy could procure iroiicUds in F.tiropo that would uieii.i.v our great cities with de atriietioii or lay them under contribution." "Hut would not our fortifying now haik a If we cxsi tei war?"

"Hut idler the fortifications should lo constructed would you Mill maintain tho tax on whlskv?" "Yes," said Mr. Itlaln-. "So long us there is whi-ty to tax I would tax it, and when tlio national government should have no use (or the money I would divide the tax among the I-e. feral l uioii with he ss llie ohiect of lightening the lax on real eatale. Tlio hmiM-a und l.irni of the whole country psvtisi larve a proportion of the total taxes. If nil iiuately relief could lie given iu that dins-lion, it would In my judgment, lie a wine nud Is nellei nt policy. Nunc liom-atbiit iiiiagiiided friends of Ic uiicrancr have iwd that the gov ernment should not ue the money derived from the tax on whisky. My reply is that the tax on whisky by the federal fiveruinent, w ith its suppression of all II-ii-it diatillntion and cotieuriit enhnm-e-n lent of price, baa li n a Miwrrful ngent In the teins-mnce reforui by putting it beyoiid Hie reach of so innny.

After a few moments' silence, Mr. Mains added that, ill his juditnieiit, tho whisky tax ahoul.l lie so inoditled a to permit all who lira pure ali-ohol in the arts or in me chanical pursuits to have It free of tax. In ull such cases the tax could l0 omitted without ilaiiin-r of fisn. I, Just as now the lax on spirits exported is remitted.

To break down wool growing and bo dependent on foreign countries for tho blanket under which we sleep, nud tho coat that covers our backs, is not a wise policy for the national government to en force." "Do you think if tho President's recom mendation wero adopted it would increase our exjKirt trade?" "Possibly in some fewarticles of peculiar construction, but it would increase other import trade ten fold as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen und cotton gisjds. in iron, in steel, in all tho thousand ami one shaH-s in which they are wrought. How are wc to export staple fabrics to tho markets of Furoiie, and how ore we to manufacture thorn cheaper than thev do iu Kuroi?, unless ye get cheaper lubor than they have in Kurope?" "Then you think that the question of labor underlies the w hole subject?'' "Of course it does," replied Mr. Hlaine. "It ia, in fact, theentiroquestion. When ever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every depart ment to work as cheaply and live as )sorly in tho United States as similar workmen in Kurope, wo can, of course, manufacture just as cheaply as they do in England and Franco. Hut 1 am totally opposed to a policy that would entail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to a social and financial revolution, and that would bring untold distn-ss." "Yes, but might not the greut funning claffs bo Is-nelilcd by imKrtmg articles from ICuropu Instead' of buying them ut higher prices nt home?" "The moment," answered Mr. Maine, "you liegin to import freely from F.uroo you drive your own workmen from me chanical and manufacturing pursuits. In the same proportion they become tillers of tho soil, increasing steadily the agricult ural product and decreasing steadily tho largo homo deuiand, which is constantly enlarging a home manufacturers enlarge. That, of course, works great injury to tlio farmer, glutting tho market with his prod ucts and tending constantly to lower prices." "Y'es, hut the foreign demand for farm products would be increased in like ratio, would it not?" "Fven supsio ltwero,"sald Mr. Hlaine; "now, ilojou know the source from which it will bo supplied? The tendency in Itus sia today and in tho Asiatic istsscssioiis of r.nglnnil is towuM a large increase ol the grain supply, the grain being raised by tho cheapest piavuhlo lalsir. Manufactur ing countries will buy their bread stuffs whero they can get them cheapest, and thu enlarging of tho homo market for tho American farmer Is-ing checked, ho would search in vain for one of tho same value. His foreign sales uro ul ready clun ked by the great coin- M-tition aliroa-l. lhoro never was a time when the inereaso nf a latve homo market was so valuable to him. The Is-st proof ia Hint tho farmer are prosis-nius in propor lion to tho nenrm-tw of manufactur ing centers, nud a protective tariff tend to spread manufacture. In Obiojand Indiana, for example, tliOUL'h not classed as manufacturing States, tho annual vnlue of fabrics is larger than ths annual value of airrlcultuml products. "Hut those holding tho l'resident's views," remarked the reporter, "nre nl- wavs quoting tho great pmss-rity of tho country under the tariff of lsw." "That tariff did not involve the distinct ive laiitit recommended by the President, namely: the reluining o) direct intermit taxes in order to aliolisli indirect luxes levied on foreign fabrics. Jhit the country had peculiar advantuu-es under it by the i rimean war Involving r.ugliiiul, trance and Kussia. and luivuly iuipiiiiinif their trade; these incidents, or accidents, were immensely stimulating to trade in the United Mutes, regardless of the nature of our tnrilf. l!ut mark the end of this Kuropesn cx-ricnco with the tariff of iKtii, w hich for a time gave an illusory and deceptivo show ol prosperity. Its enact ment was iniinediutely followed by the Mexican war, then, in'l'MH, by the great convulsions of Kiimjs; then, in lHtli and succeeding years, by the enormous gold yield in California.

History is re js'iiting itself. "Hy the way."

"Then do you menu to Imply that Ihere should lie'no reduction of the national revenue?" "No, whut I have said implies the re terse.

"1 mean," said Mr. Maine, "that no crest system of revenue like our tanlf can os-rale with elhYieney and equity unions the cluing- oi irsuo in closely wale lirsl nud the law promptly adapted' to those changes. Hut I would make no change that should impair tho protcclivo character of tho wholo laxly of the tarilf laws. Four years ago, in the act of lss:t, wo made chaug-s of tho character I hsvo tried lo indicate.

"Hul what alsiut the existing surplus?" "The ntwtrnct of tho message I huvo seen," replied Mr. Hlaine, "contains no Tvfcrcnco U) that isiint. I, therefore, inako no comment further than to Indorse Mr. Fred Grant's remark that a surplus is always easier to handle than a deficit." The reporter reported the question whether llie President's recommendations would mil give us the advantage of a Urge, increase oil 0Xir1?" "I only repeat," answered Mr. Itlslne, "tlmt it would vastly enlarge our lintiorta, while the only export it would seriously liurvuao woulube our jfold and silver." 

DRUMMERS AND BAILBOADS. A Suggestion for Getting- Around ths Law A Hotel Syndicate. From tho St. Louis Republican. Gen. Frank J. Jones, general ngout Traders' and Travelers' union of New York, arrived In tho city yesterday and registered at tho Planters'. Gen. Jones visits tho west for tho purpose of estab lishing a branch office in tlus city, and for tho further purpose of making an attempt to got an opinion from tho inter-state com merce commission as to the rights of com mercial travelers as fur as excels of bag gage is concerned. "Heretofore tho commission has refused to pass uisin our point." said he to a llr- pulluitn reporter. "Our proposition is to charge eacn commercial traveler $.s zw a year; of that amount 20 cents will ho charged for bnggngo plates, $1 for membership and $1 for insurance of JUKI pounds of buggngo In tho sum of $200. In our turn, the union proposes to release tho railroads from all liability for damages on every account. We con tend, therefore, that if tho railronds nre al lowed to trunsjiort 300 pounds of baggage for each man, it will not be discrimination in favor of drummers, but that tho roads will lie getting an equivalent in tho form of their release from liability. Ono of thu eastern roads, which had already inado contracts w ith our nuunliors. proposed to live up to those contracts ami to fight tho commission if it objected. The commis sion did not object in that case, however, hut put its acquiescence on the ground that it was simply an unexpired contract tlmt was being carried out, nud failed or refused to pass on tho question whether or not such an arrangement er so wna in terdicted by tho interstate commerce bill." "Y'ou think, then, that tho reduced rates to drummers will not ho in conflict with tho law?" ho was asked. "No, because we aro giving, as I said, un equivalent in tho release from liability on account of damages. I am sure tiiat if wc get tho commission to pass upon he matter at all, we shall win; if not In-fore tho commission, boforo the supreme courts. Tho supremo court has already decided one great siiut for us, and tlmt was the requirement, under tho laws of some States, that drummer take out a license to sell goisls. Wo had a hill in Congress to iqwct that hardship, but tho supremo court settled it in passing non an individ ual case. Two of tlio States still persist iu arresting men for selling without license, and it is generally paid, because it is only $') or $10, and payment of that sum is tho cheapest way out of tho trouble. If ony one would test tho matter wo would wiii. I am here, however, on another item of .our business. Wo huvo a sys tem of hotel rates guaranteed us Jn many cities, and it is to further this phase of our business that I am here. Wo have already iVrt) hotels throughout the country in which our coupons are takeu for cash. Wc sell book of coiiMns to traveling men, and the presentation of those coupons to tho hotels in payment of Isiard ut once identities the traveler and entitles him to the rale agreed to with ti. Whenever wo issue a Issik we are compelled to dcjHisit nn amount of cash sutlicient to buy back tho cousns, iu tho Chemical baiik of New ' Y'ork city.

Tbe Price on the Increase, Causing- a Falling Off In Consumption. Fmm the St. bruin Iti-pnbllcan. Dealers in coffee in St. Louis are not en joying a very heavy tra In in that staple at present. Tlio n-ceiit advance has hnd a tendency to make buyers hold off, in the hope that a reaction was not far off, but this seemed to be a forlorn lio. Coffee today is fully 1 cent higher than it was ten days ago. Price are steady, and job-ls-rs do not look for any change for some lime. It Is well known tlmt the stiffening of prices of colfee was caused by the short uire 'jf tho current year's crop, aided by a sH-culative movement in New Y'ork. Hix Urn mouths ago fair gradea of colfee were sold in this market by the jobbers for fl cents per pound, while tho price now is 15 cents, and some deulers quote as high as IH cents.
