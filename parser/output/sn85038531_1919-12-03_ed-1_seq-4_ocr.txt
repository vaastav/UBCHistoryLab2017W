MOSES ON NEW LEAD. Senator Moses, of New Hampshire, fulfills Artemus Ward's description of 'an amoosln' cuss," Perhaps he is most amusing or ridiculous, as the case may be when he attempts to imitate the example of his anclont prototype and to essay the role of leadership. He is very zealous, bow ever, and when a diversion in any one direction does not produce the desired results, nothing daunted, he takes a new taok. Apparently, , be fcara nothing ao much as the pnas! bllity that the country will forget he is on tha Job. The New Hampshire senator's !at est bid for fame is one which con' celvably causes Senator Newberry to wish the use of an extinguuber upon his restless but obtuse colleague. Be cause Senator Newberry and bia campaign organization have been In dicted for flagrant frauds in a Mich igan senatorial election, Senator Mosea proposes to investigate suf frage restrictions in the south. He frankly aays that that is tba reason. Looks very much Ilka a plea of guilty for Senator Newberry, doesn't It? Else why should the two cases be coupled together? Divested of camouflage. Senator Moses' proposition simply means a challenge to the democrats that they are Just as guilty as Newberry. "You let us alone and we'll let you alone." His resolution to investigate suffrage conditions In the south with a view to cutting down representa tion in congress has no other sig nificance. There is nothing in south ern suffrage regulations that con gress does not already know. There ara evidently features of the recent Michigan senatorial election, how ever, wbtch somebody is anxious to prevent becoming known. We do not believe Senator Moses can scare anybody. Democrats ought to and perhaps will accept the Issue which he raises. The straw which hs wants to thresh is already worn to chaff. Time was when such flaunting of the bloody shirt was pro ductive of political results, but the question Is stale now. Abler men than Senator Moses have worn It to m. frnMle. 8111X011 it UP now is a mighty poor blind behind which to conceal the debauchery of the elec torate of a great state. As ws have Irenrfv intimated, we believe It is equivalent to a confession of guilt CAN FALL BACK ON POLITICS. The Indianapolis News ssks "what In the world ahall ws do when the miners' strike Is settled, the peace pact out of the way and the rail dir. fliiitv t an end?" And then a bright Idea dawns upon It which online it to exclaim. "Oh. yes, we have a political campaign next year. And this reminds of the one-time custom of drowning in drink trou bles which could not otherwise be borne. Finding the way blocked by the questions referred to, the News hints that relief can be round Dy im mersing the country so deeply In pol itics that It will forget its other troubles for the time. There is a degree of comfort In the News' suggestion. When we have adjusted these problems, it is rea suring to know that time will not hang heavy on our hands while we are looking for other worlda to con quer. But It Is yet too early to be come apprehensive. When we have settled the coal strike, disposed of the peace treaty and unscrambled the railroads, we may be ready to restj It ta all well enough to keep politics near at hand to prevent a hiatus, but our laughing over the solution of these problems and the suppression of bolEhevlsm ought to be done 'after the job Is .completed. That may be some time yet. We know that the coal Is In the earth, but how to get it out is not so lievlng in it "For centuries the western pagan had struggled with the Ideals of a religion of subordination coming to him from the past" Then Darwin's book was written. "But here (Darwin) was a con ception of life which stirred to its depths the Inheritance in him from the past epochs of time. . The pagan heart of the west sang within simple JCist now. It is some comfort to reflect that summer will come again next year and that we shall need less coat We know that the nations, most of them, have sua pended organized hostilities, but when we shall have a definite peace settlement doth not vat onnMr Per haps, as Senator Lodge intimates. It itself am ln ecstatl iov-' win come easier after the election is over. The railroad question, however, seems to abide with us almost as constantly as the poor. It absolutely refuses to amy settled. There might ha danger of a state of ennui If the railroads were no longer to be mon keyed with. "RIGHTS" AND "WRONGS." Tha right of Individuals to strike is Inviolate and ought not to be Inter fered with by any process of gov ernment, but there ia a predominant right and that is the right of the government to protect all of Its peo ple and to assert Its power and maj eaty against the challenge of any class.- President Wilson, This covers the field of Industrial contention comprehensively. The right of "individuals" to forsake un profitable employment at wMl ia uni versally conceded. And this implies that the individual must be bis own Judge of whether the terms of em ployment are satisfactory. We say there is no controversy over this point Striking, however, as gen erally understood contemplates action as a body or class. It IsHn this sense that the contention has become sharp snd well-defined. The strike has been employed by working men in their organized ca paclty with obviously good effect It is when it is used as an instrument of defense, however, that it has won most sympathy and support from the public When it Is used as an of fensive weapou of coercion. In a man ner which Involves the comfort or well being of society, it is sure to arouse protest. It undoubtedly car ries with it. In such Instances, poten tiality of great harmeven destruc tion to civilization. Right there I where the Issue Is raised. Mr. Roosevelt once undertook to classify great industrial combinations as "good trusts" and "bad trusts: If it were possible to draw the line of distinction clearly, a similar clas siflcation might be made of strikes. Cnder such a regime, no reasonable person would want to Interfere with a "good -strike," but a "bad strike' would not be tolerated. Is such i classification possible and practica ble? Can we outlaw the bad strike and protect the good? Thos? who legislate for us would pay a sizeable reward for a satisfactory answer to this question. The serious feature of the situa tion lies ln the fact that a solution must be found or humanity must suffer. Civilization cannot brook a strike which threatens Its undoing. But what is to be done? As we have several times suggested, we believe the workingmen themselves could do much to promote a constructive set tlement of the question at issue. Isn't it possible to devise a scheme rM,th will KafpB'iinrA VArvbnrfv'fl rlchts and. at the same time, render are expressed in the following quota- the strike unnecessary? ve believe Then he relates, how our ideals have changed. "Men have come to listen silently when told that ultimate principles do not Justify prophecies of peace and good will." Ha shows his contempt of those who advocate peace because it "paid best" At least the militarists were willing to sacrifice. . Then he tells how the movement In nations was followed by that or classes, and outlines the growth ot the organizations of labor and de scribes their resort to what amounted to conscription. The first demand of labor," he says, "was for nothing less than the compuleory organization of Its own class throughout all the nations." The closed shop" ln effect is "nothing more or less than the demand that no workman shall ultimately earn his j livelihood without first being a mem ber of a trade union." The breaking of contracts he Ilk ened to the abrogation of treaties by nations and he cited the fact that although many such Instances oc curred ln England they were univer sale condoned, because labor had such a political influence. Capital, too, was brought "pro foundly and on a world scale into conflict with the social emotion, The latter he defines as the liberal movements for more Just laws and institutions. "The vastest returns" he said were obtained "by artificial raising and de pressing the stock exchange values.' So the propaganda becomes an appeal for the votes of the proletariat to sweep the whole system away'; in other words syndicalism, I. W. W. or bolshevisra. . Darwin's "Origin of Species" he calls the "Bible of the doctrine of force. Its hold on the popular mind is one of the most remarkable inci dents in history of human thought." As Ntetzche said "It impeaches the greatest blasphemy in time the re ligion which has enchained us." The fundamental conclusion of nis book la expressed In this sentence: "Power In civilization rests on col lective emotion, not on reason." He cited the Instance of Japan In completely changing Its customs and civilization In a few generations. "Within the life of a single genera tion." he said, "it can be made to undergo changes so profound, so rev. olutlotiary. so permanen that it would almost appear as if human na ture had been completely altered ln the interval." Then we come to his main deduc tion, which will be most attacked, that the Ideal in a race Is ex pressed better by the younger mind than by the older and better by the female than by the male. Some of his thoughts on this and other points 

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1919. a IN A REMINISCENT MOOD Henry WUtsa Relate Soma Interesting Facte About "Jim" Pamberton, the VirginUn. Jamas P. Pembertoa had aa extraor dinarily wide range of personal ac quaintance. Few men, ne matter bow prominent and wall known, have so large a list of actual, personal ac quaintances. He was "Jim" to all of them. They all liked him. Had he bean fond of enemies, as soma men confessedly are, ha would nave deemed himself severely subject to a privation. Ha was a "fellow of Infinite last." a moat interesting conversationalist al ways companionable, and ever ready to accommodate friends, no matter at what coat of inconveniences. Ona Is apt to recall, in thinking of him, the remarkable popularity of two me a re lated to each other as were he and his father-in-law. the late Fletcher Rogers.

Mrs. Oernett Andrews, wife of Col. Qarnett Andrews, and Mrs. A. W. Games, were prominently mentioned. Mrs. Gaines also, was one of our favorite alngers. A C. Hambleton. Frank A Nelson and Belden Samuels were mentioned as among the prominent men here, and E. R. Better ton. N. C. Ford. John R. Courtney and John Grama, were others, noted. Mr. and Mrs. R.

(BY ARTHUR BRISBANE) WE MUST , CONSERVE SPACE I The government of tha United States will run the soft coal mines while workers and mine owners make up their minds to stop fighting. It Is good news that the govern ment Intends to dig the coal, and It is safe to say that no nonsense will be endured from workers or mine owners. The people of this and other coun tries are not ln a mood, Just now. to ireeze wnile oronteers of any kind, owners or workers, split hairs ana flgnt each other. Billy Sunday recently calculated for Ws congregation how long It would take, traveling on an express train, to go from this world to the planet Uranus, if such a trip were possible, but we would like for him to ride on a Chattanooga street car and tell us how long it would take on that sort of a conveyance. "The law Is the only thing that protects men for trying to destroy It," Is a paradox the discovery of which Is announced by the Jackson vllle Times-Union. Jeff McLemore says Villa was 200 miles from the scene at the time of the Columbus raid. It had been our impression, however, that he met and talked with American officers at the border line the day before. There were also various reports that he was recognized by different persons during the raid. Whether intended as a boost or a knock, the Nashville Banner is now contending that Gen. Obregon, who is running for president of Mexico, is nothing more than an Irishman whose former name O'Brien has been corrupted to Obregon. If workmen think that thev have neen treated unjustly, let them re member that they are living, not in Russia, but in a republic. All they need Is to get 61 per cent of the people to think as they do and say so at the polls. A great many more than 61 per cent, are workers, and they can do legally exactly aa they Please. They can allow mine owners 10 per cent pront Instead of the 600 and even J.,000 per cent profit that they have been making, according to Mc- Adoo. They can pay the difference to the workers, which would be better than having the gigantic profits go to mine owners; or, what would be really Just they can divide the dif ference between the workers and the public, Increasing the pay of work ers, reducing the cost of coal. Nearly all news passes and loses its Importance ln a few hours. Here is news that will be Important cen turies nence. The Rockefellers, through their ad mirable scientific institute, believe that they can absolutely destroy the disease caused by the hookworm. If John D.
