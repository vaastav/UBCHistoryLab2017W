8 SECRETARY OF STATE OLNEY'S REPORT. Summarizes Important Questions Occupy ing tkt Department's Attention. Venezuelan Dispute, and General Arbi tration Treaty. Describes the Character and Scope of the Hostile Operations Which Now Affect the Greater Part of Cuba, Giving; His Deductions as to the Positions of the Contending Parties—Not Only No Local Gov ernment in the Territory Overrun by Insurgents, But Nowhere Ap pears the Nucleus of Statehood. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The re port of the Secretary of State, to which President Cleveland refers in his message to Congress, states that "the relations of the United Suites with foreign powers continue ujxm that foot ing of harmony and friendliness which has been their fortunate characteristic for so many years." The report sum marizes the more important questions Which have occupied the attention of the department during the current year. Of the dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela, it says: "The long protracted dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela over the boundary between the latter republic and British Guiana has for a number of years past attracted the earnest at tention of this Government and en listed its friendly offices to bring about an adjustment of friendly relations in the best interests of right and justice as determinable by the historical record and the actual facts. The extended discussion of the subject culminated in July of last year by an elaborate pres entation to the British Government of the views of the United States touching the opportuneness and necessity of a final disposition of the points at issue by the pacific resort of an equitable ar bitration. "The entire correspondence having been laid before Congress with the mes sage of December 17, 1895, that body provided for the appointment of a democratic commission of eminent jurists to examine and report touch ing the ascertainable facts of the con troversy, with a view to enable this Government to determine its further course in the matter. That commission has pursued its labors unremitingly during the present year, its researches b ing greatly aided by the elaborate statements placed at its disposal by both interested Governments, together with a mass of documentary evidence furnished from the archives of the European countries that shared In the early disc veries and settlement of South America, "Pending the arduous investigation, however, the Governments of the United States anc Great Britain have Otnttted no endeav r to a friendly understand ing upon the main issue of principle through the diploma tic negotiations, and it is most gratifying to announce that amicable councils have prevailed to induce a satisfactory result whereby the boundary question and its asso ciated phrases have been at last elim inated as between this country and England. A complete accord has been reached between them by which the substantial terms of a treaty of arbitra tion to be concluded by Great Britain and Venezuela have been agreed upon, the provisions of which embrace a full arbitration of the whole controversy Upon a basis alike just and honorable to both the contestants. "It only remains for the two parties dir.etly concerned to complete this equitable arrangement by signing the proposed formal treaty, and no doubt is entertained that Venezuela, who so earnestly SOOgfat the friendly assistance of the United States in the settlement Of this vexatious question, and which bus confided its interests to the impar tial judgment of this Gov. rnment, will ■snrnt to the formal adjustment thus attained, forever ending a dispute in volving far-reaching consequences to

The United States and Great Britain have given repeated proofs of their acquiescence to the great princi ple evolved, not only by treaties be tween themselves, but severally, by concluding like adjustments with other Powers for the adjudication of disputes; the subject was naturally approached in a benevolent spirit of agreement, and the negotiations have so satisfactorily progressed as to foreshadow a practi cal agreement at an early date upon tbe text of a convention to the desired end." Under the head of Spain, the Secre tary, In his accompanying report, which is, of course. Indorsed by the President, speaks of the Cuban situation as fol lows: "The situation in the island of Cuba has largely engrossed the attention of the Department of State during the past year. Its efforts to obtain trust worthy Information, and to insure due protection to citizens of the United States and their property and interests within the theater of disturbance, have been ably seconded by the Consular re ports in that island. "As regards the character and scope of the hostile operations which now af fect the greater part of Cuba, the re ports of our Consuls are properly con fidential, and while precise as to the several districts touching which reports bare been received, the nature and sources of the information obtained are such as to make detailed publication impracticable, so that the department is not in a position to do more at pres ent than state its general deductions as to Ihe position of the contending par tit s. "Confined at the outset, as In the ten years' Insurrection, which began at Yara. in October. 1868, to the eastern portion of the island, where the topog raphy and absence of settled centers especially favored the desultory war fare apparently normal to this class of contests, the present insurrection ver ily took proportions beside those of its predecessors, and therewith assumed an aggressive phase, invading the pop ulous central and western districts. "Passing the defensive lines, or trocha, traversing the island from north to south, formidable bodies of the rev olutionary forces early in the year es tablished themselves in the rich sugar planting districts of Santa Clara, Cien fugos and Matanzas. made hostile forays almost in sight of Havana itself, and advancing westward effected a lodg ment In the fertile fields of Pinar del Rio, which lias so far resisted all ef forts of the Spanish forces to overcome. "No prominent seaport has been at tacked by the insurgents, or even men aced, beyond occasional raids upon the outskirts. A large part of the miles of the irregular coast line of Cuba, comprising the comparatively unsettled stretches of its western ex tremity and tiie unhospitable mountain shores oi its eastern part, is practically in the hand.-- of the revolutionists. The character of these shores, filled to the westward with shallow indentations in accessible to any but light vessels of small tonnage, and to the eastward with rocky nooks dangerous to ap proach by night and affording insecure anchorage for larger craft, lends itself peculiarly to the guerrilla warfare of the interior, so that the insurgents, be ing relieved of the need of maintaining and garrisoning points upon the coast, are effectively able to utilize a consid erable part of it as occasion offers to communicate with the outside world, and to receive clandestine supplies of men, arms and ammunition. "While thus. In fact, controlling the gTeajter part of the internal area of the whole island of Cuba from Cape San Ahtonio to Cape May. and enjoying practically unlimited use of an equally large part of the coast, the revolution ary forces are scattered, being nowhere united for any length of time to form an army capable of attack or siege, and fit to take the defensive in a pitched battle Assembling suddenly at a giv en point, often in a single night, they make unexpected sallies ~r carry dev astation to the tobacco and cane fields of Cuba, and at the first sign of pur suit or organized attack they disperse, to assemble in like manner at some oth er point "Sii far as our information shows, there is not only no local government by the insurgents in the territory they overrun, but there is not even a tangi ble potence to establish one any where. Th- re nowhere appears the nu cleus of statehood. The machinery for exercising the legitimate rights and powers of sovereignty, and responding to the obligations which de facto soy

It is not possible to discern a homogeneous political entity, possessing and exercising the functions of admin istration, and capable, if left to itself, of maintaining orderly government in its own territory and sustaining normal relations with the external family of governments. "To illustrate the conditions, the in surgent chiefs assert the military power to compel peaceable citizens of the United States within their territory to desist from planting or grinding cane, under the decred penalty of death and destruction of their crops and mills, but the measure is one of sheer force, with out justification under public law. The wrongs so committed against the citi zens of a foreign State are without an international forum of redress to which the Government of the United States may have recourse as regards its rela tion to the perpetrators. The acts are those of anarchy, and in default of the responsibilities of de facto Statehood in the case, there remains only the terri torial accountability of the titular sov ereign within the limits of its compe tency to repress the wrongs com plained of. "In opposition to the nomadic control of the interior and the undefended coast by the insurgents, the Spanish author ity continues in the Capital City and seaports. Its garrisons are there estab lished. Prom them its naval operations are directed and executed. Most of its functions proceed as in time of peace. Its customs and municipal revenues are regularly collected, and with the ex ception of the temporary restraints al leged to be due to the admitted exist ence to a state of. hostilities, foreign commerce with the island is kept up, although largely diminished by the nat ural concentration of the Cuban market of supply and demand. As to these parts of the island with which this country and its citizens maintain legit imately normal intercourse, the Span ish power is supreme, although often exercised in a vexatious and arbitrary way. calling for just remonstrance. "So far, therefore, as the relative po sition of the Spanish and insurgent fore es is compatible with the situation during the Yara insurrection, while the same phases of organized administra tion in the capital and seaports and trade with the outside world on the one side, and on the other a nomadic organization without Government and strong only to wage harassing warfare m the interior, are now, as then ap- Pf^J;- 1 - 3 resent insurrection stands not , ab],i contrast with its predeces sors both to force and scale of opera- *t™h Btat,stl ™ of their military • trtngth are attainable with difficulty obt uned ,lot aU r a >' s when iS ****** known to « Revolutionists 1" the fi.

The nature of the struggle, however ;;>' ! \-s most earnest consideration! rhe increased scale on which it is waged brings into bolder relief all the appall ing phases which often appear among the Latin races of the Western Hemis phere. Excesses before confined to a portion of the island became more im br-ssne when wrought throughout its whole territory. The insurgent author ity, as has been seen, finds no regular administrative expression; it is as serted only by the sporadic and irre sponslble force of arms. The Spanish power, outside the larger towns and their immediate suburbs, when mani fested at all is equally forceful and ar bitrary. 'The one apparent aim on either side is to cripple the adversary 1 y indiscrim inate destruction of all that by any chance may benefit him. The populous and wealthy districts of the center and west, which have escaped harm in for mer contests, are now ravaged and laid waste by the Mind fury of the respect ive partisans. The principles of civil ised warfare, according to the code made sacred by the universal acquiescence of nations, are only too often violated with impunity by irresponsible subordinates, acting at a distance from the central authority, and able to shield themselves from just censure Or punishment by false or falsified versions Of the facts.

"A targe part of the correspondence of the State Department with its agents in Cuba has been devoted to these eases of assault upon the rights of our citi sena. In no instance has earnest re monstrance and energetic appeal been emitted. But the reports of the Span ish power often find it easily practica ble to postpone expdanatlons and repa ration, on the ground of alleged igno rance- of facts or for other plausible reasons.

ABSOLUTELY PURE rights, is no less in point. Exact sta tistics of the amount of such invest ments are not obtainable. A gross es timate of $80,000,000 would be more likely to fall under than over the mark. A large proportion of these investments is now exposed to the exceptional vicis situdes of the war. Estates have been desolated and crops destroyed by the insurgents and Spanish alike. Upon those not actually ravaged operations have been compulsorily suspended by order of the Spanish authorities, thus entailing enforced loss. The loss does not fall upon the capital alone, but large numbers of the agricultural la boring classes are driven from fields to the nearest towns, partly by the per emptory orders of the local military commanders and partly by the cessa tion of destruction of their only means of livelihood. Among them are many sons of the United States. It is offi cially reported that there are in one provincial city alone some 3,000 neces sitous refugees to whom municipal authorities can afford little or no relief. Over 300 of these are American citi zens engaged in prosperous farming and stock raising at the beginning of the outbreak, whose employment and resources have been swept away by eighteen months of civil strife, reduc ing them from affluence to penury and throwing them upon the charity of an unhospitable community in a devasta ted land. "AH these disastrous conditions, with the evils and disorders necessarily fol lowing In their train, are interfering with the insular avenues of trade, and very gravely impairing the business operations of Cuba. From whatever point of view we regard the matter, it is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at our door alike dan gerous to good relations, destructive of legitimate commerce, fatal to the in ternal resources of Cuba and most vex atious and trying by entailing upon this Government excessive burdens in its domestic administration and its out ward relations. This situation cannot indefinitely continue without growing still worse, and the time may not be far distant when the United States must seriously consider whether its rights and interests, as well as its in ternational duties, do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." Mr. Olney, mentioning that "the right of every citizen arrested in Cuba to have the benefit of ordinary criminal proceedings guaranteed by existing treaties has been energetically insisted upon," refers to the ship Competitor af fair as follows: "In April last the Competitor, a small schooner of American registry', eluded the vigilance of the Federal authori ties, took on board men and supplies presumably Intended to aid the Cuban insurrection, and reached the coast lof that island near San Cayetano. Being discovered by the Spanish coast guard, a conflict ensued, resulting in the cap ture of a number of those on board, as well as the seizure of the vessel. The captives were subjected to a sum mary military trial, which, although conducted by an admiralty court, ad judged to be competent, appeared to have lacked the essential safeguards of procedure called for in the existing con ventions between the United States and Spain. The Government insisted on its citizens securing all the rights to which they were entitled. The case was sub sequently carried to the higher tribunal at Madrid, which has set the convic tion aside and remanded the case for retrial." He further says: "This Government has been constrained to enter earnest protest against a recent decree of the Governor-General of Cuba ordering the registration of all aliens in the island, and pronouncing all those not regis tered within a certain time as de barred from appealing to the provis ions of existing law. The treaty rights of American citizens obviously depend on their actual allegiance to their own Government, not upon any arbitrary inscriptions as aliens by the State wherein they may be sojourning: and while this Government is well disposed to admit the convenience of the pro posed registry as an additional evidence Of the right of such citizens in Cuba to the protection of the authorities, and lias signified its willingness to facilitate their registration, it can never consent that the omission of a merely local formality can operate to outlaw any persons entitled to its protection as citi zens, or to abrogate the right to the orderly resources of Spanish law sol emnly guaranteed to them by treaty." FATAL RAILWAY COLLISION. Three lien Killed and Several Others Injured. CINCINNATI, Dec. 7.—A collision oc curred at 8 o'clock this morning near Storrs' Station on the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad between an accommodation train from Cochran, Ind., and a special made up of a passen ger coach and two private cars. Three persons were killed and seveial injured. The killed are: John Price, fireman of the accommodation train; Homer Dixon, fireman of the special train; P. L. Zippernuk, civil engineer, North Bend. The special was carrying all the gen eral officers of the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern, who were out to make a thorough inspection of the road. The engineer and conductor of the Special had orders to follow fifteen min utes behind the preceding regular train and to keep out of the way of the ac commodation train No. 22, which had the right of way. The special stopped at Storrs. where it Should have waited for No. 22, but the engineer and conductor both forgi t the order eoncernig that train and pulled out. Three-fourths of a mile west of Storrs the trains came together. There was a fog, which prevented See ing clearly, so neither engineer sus p . ted a collision until the shock came. Bill to Stop Cigarette Manufacture. LA PORTE (Ind.). Dec. 7.—A bill will l>e presented at the next session of the Indiana Legislature which will pro hibit the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in this State. The W. C. T.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Venezuela has accepted the arbitration as agreed upon by Secretary Olney and Sir Julian Pauncefote. Secretary Olney received a cablegram from Minister Andrew at Caracas to that effect this afternoon. NATIONAL LEGISLATURE AGAIN IN SESSION. The First Day Presents No Remarkable Features in Either House. Reading of the Message Takes Up Most of the Time. Those Portions Which Related to the Armenian Outrages and the Revo lution in Cuba the Only Ones Which Evoked Any Special Inter est Among the Senators and Representatives. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The first day of the second session of the Fifty-fourth Congress presented no re markable features. The President's annual message was read in both houses without apparently evoking any special interest. The only excep tion to that rule was in regard to the portions of the message devoted to the Armenian outrages and to the revolu tion in Cuba. On the first of these sub jects the President stated his belief that "the present somber prospect in Turkey will not be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom." The President's discussion of the Cub in question was exhaustive and impartial, but its summing up indicated the tem per and views of the Administration. It is in these words: "When the ina bility of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has become manifest a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher ob ligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge." These declarations appear to obtain general favor and approval. The message cov ered eighteen printed pamphlet pages and its reading occupied one hour and fifty" minutes. 

SENATE PROCEEDINGS. Punctually at noon the Senate was called to order by Vice-President Stevenson and prayer was offered by the blind chaplain, Rev. Mr. Milburn. A special blessing was asked for the Senator from lowa, Mr. Allison (Rep.), that he might be restored to perfect health and brought speedily to his seat. At the conclusion of the prayer the list of Senators wa.s called and seventy- One Senators responded, the absentees being Messrs. Allison, Blancharri, Brown, Butler, Caffery, George, Hans brough, Hill, Irby, Jones (New), Lind say, Mcßride, Martin, Morgan, Stew art, Teller, Warren and White. Indefinite leave of absence on ac count of sickness was given to George (Dem.) of Mississippi. A resolution was adopted to appoint two Senators to join a like committee from the House to await upon the Pres ident. Senators Sherman and Smith were selected on the part of the Senate and then a recess was taken until 1 o'clock. At 1:45 Mr. Sherman reported that the committee had waited upon the President and had been informed that the President would immediately com municate a message in writing. There upon the message was delivered by Mr. Pruden, one of the President's Secre taries, and the Secretary of the Senate, Mr. Cox, began its reading, but that duty was soon turned over to the read ing clerks. At 3:35 o'clock the Senate adjourned until to-morrow. IN THE 

HOUSE. The House presented a bright and cheerful appearance this morning when the galleries were thrown open to visitors. The members of the House, like the occupants of the galleries, com menced to put in an appearance as early as 10 o'clock, although tbe hour for the meeting was 12 o'clock. The Represen tatives from the West and Middle West who received a re-nomination and were not engulfed, congratulated them selves and each other. The desk of ex- Speaker Crisp was draped in mourning. Promptly at noon Speaker Reed's gavel fell, and the second session of the Fifty fourth Congress began. Chaplain Cowden offered the opening prayer, at the close of which the Speaker ordered a call of the house. The call disclosed the presence of U7l members. William A. Stokes re-returned from the Seventh South Carolina District, was sworn in, and in regard to C. J. Boatner of Louisiana, similarly un seated on a contest during the last ses sion, a certificate from the Governor of Louisiana was read certifying to his election. Cannon (Rep.) of Illinois. Bayne (R.) of New York and Turner (D.) of Georgia were appointed a committee to wait up on the President. The House hen took a recess until 1:30 p. m. On reassembling, Mr. Pruden, the President's Executive clerk, presented the message, which was read by direc tion of the Speaker. When the reading of the message was finished it was on motion of Dingley re ferred to the Committee of the Whole and ordered printed. W. A. Stone from the Appropriations Committee reported the pensions appro priations bill for the coming fiscal year. Turner of Georgia, on being recog nized, stated that it was his melancholy duty to inform the House of the death of his colleague, ex-Speaker Crisp, who died at Atlanta, Ga., October 28d. At a later day he would ask that a day be assigned for paying proper respect to his distinguished character and eminent public services. He offered the follow ing resolutions: Resolved. That the House has heard with profound sorrow of the death of Hon. Charles F. Crisp, late a Represen tative from the State of Georiga. Resolved, That as a mark of respect to his memory the House do now adjourn. The resolutions were adopted, and the House, at 3:50, accordingly adjourned until noon to-morrow. THE

CORWIN'S MILLINERY,^ff 607 J Street, Sacramento. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE WAS THE BURDEN OF TALK AT McKINLEY'S HOHE. The President-Elect Reads the Docu ment, But Hakes No Comment Upon Its Contents. CANTON (O.). Doc. 7.—The burden of the talk in Canton and at the heme of the President-elect to-day was about President Cleveland's message to Con gress. The people about the town dis cussed it. the visitors discussed it. and some of the Congressmen who w ere here to-day mildly criticised certain parts of it. Major McKinley read it from a copy furnished him by one of the telegraph companies an hour or two before Con gress assembled. The opening sen tence, with its strong implied approval of the results of the recent election, seemed full of pleasant interest ior the President-elect, though he made no ver bal comment upon any portion of tho document. He read aloud parts of it to a group of friends, and they com mented occasionally on some of the writer's observations. Major McKinley turned to the por tion of the message devoted to a consid eraton of Cuban affairs with the keen est interest, and read it aloud in clear, incisive, earnest tones. A Congressman who was near by said: "President Cleveland's exposi tion of the Cuban problem and his statement of the existing conditions is just, graphic and conservative, but it is much less sympathetic with the insur gents than most people bad looked for. I do not think his idea about home rule tor Cuba will come to anything practi cal, for the Cubans will not trust the Spanish Government, and would put no faith in the fairest promises. It looks to me as though we would have to rec ognize the insurgents as belligerents within ninety days." Joseph B. Keeling of Indianapolis called on Major McKnley to-night and discussed the political condition in In diana to some extent. Mr. Keeling says the impression seems to prevail that C. N. Fairbanks would be elected to the United States Senate this win ter. A new Cabinet possibility has swung into view this evening. The name for the first time on the tongue of the co terie of official Cabinet-makers about Canton and Cleveland is that of Colo nel Henry A. Duponf of Delaware.
