THE CONGRESS Energetic Efforts on Part of Idaho Representatives in Be half of Beneficial Measures. * From Northwest l'ress Association, Washington, l). C. Washington, 1). C,, Dec. 14.— The historic corridors of the Capi tol, which for seven months have been silent as the grave, once more hum with life and furnish the * l background for scenes of anima ' tion. The 59th Congress has be gun. The House of Representatives *• commenced its deliberations by electing that rugged statesman of the old school—the ex-Watchdog of the Treasury— Joseph OK Gannon, Speaker. John Tharp Williams, the brilliant young Southerner, was again .selected to lead the Democrats. Vice President Fairbanks called the Senate to order and appointed Senators Allison and Morgan as a committee to act with a like com mittee from the House and notify the President that the 59th Con giess was ready for business. House and Senate then adjourned to await the President's message, which was received the next day. The message is of unsual length and touches upon nearly every im portant subject with which the Gov ernment is concerned. As was ex pected, it deals at much length with the subjects of railroad rate legislation, labor and capital, the Panama Canal, and Santo Do mingo. The message, is a very strong one and is receiving careful study. The 

PURE FOOD ISSUE Senator Heyburn Preparing to Fight in This Behalf. Last Tuesday over three thou sand bills were introduced in the House, but none were introduced in the Senate. On Wednesday, however, many bills were intro duced in both branches. Senator Hoyburn of Idaho introduced "Pure Food Bill," which will be one of the most important measures before Congress at this session, and it is believed that he will be a able to secure its The opposition is a sel passage. fish one—based upon the interests it have which those opposing from a financial standpoint in be half of restricting legislation upon such traffic. The bill contains some new features of detail. The rules and regulations under which commerce is to be carried to be prescribed by three Departments acting together, each of them covering the class of traffic peculiar to itself. One of its pro on are visions is that no dealer can be icted under the terms of the' bill if he can produce a guaranty conv 9 EARLY BUYERS have the advantage of an unbroken stock.

Tht object of this provision is that the punishment shall be in dicted upon the real offender not upon the person imposed upon. There is strong popular feeling throughout the country for the en actment of this legislation. Last Saturday evening u meet ing was held in New York City under the auspices of the Council of Jewish Women, to consider the "Pure Food' and situation. Many noted men were present and ad dressed. the meeting, among whom were Senators McCumber an 1 IT U AjLLJ * burn. In the course of his re marks, Senator Heyburn stated that the person or corporation that puts on the market poisonous or adulterated foods, medicines, oi beverages is as guilty of a crime as the man who places poison in a spring; and that the public senti ment should be so aroused on this matter that neither the United States Senate nor the House of Representatives could overlook it. 

PUBLIC BUILDINGS ' French Will Probably Secure More tor the Gem State. Congressman French has intro duced a bill providing an apropria tion for public buildings at Poca tello, Lewiston, and Moscow. A bill to this effect was introduced by him last year and it was favorably reported by the house committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, but as the Omnibus Bill in which appropriations for public buildings are included was not permitted to come up for passage, Mr. French's bill, of course, failed to pass. This year there is a decided sentiment in favor of an Omnibus Public Buildings Bill in both the Senate and the House, and it will be a very difficult matter for the leaders to prevent its passage this session. Mr. French will use every endea at his command to have hie bill favorably reported bacx irom the committee and as he is an adept in this line of work it iB very likely that Idaho will be given public buildings this session. vor some RAILWAY RATES Chief Executive and Senator Heyburn Are Both Interested. Some newspapers have recently been trying to place Senator Hey* burn in a false light with respect to the proposed railway rate legis lation, and to give the idea that he is not in harmony with the method favored, by President Roosevelt. the Idaho Senator for the reason that President Kooeev(*t has no settled plan of rate regulation. The President is in favor of somp This is very unfair to kind-of rate regulation, and so is dent has not yet signified his de sired bill, it is ino6t unfair to say that Senator Heyhurn i« not in ac cord with the President on this matter. On the other hand it must be remembered that Senator Heyhurn last year introduced a hill for the control of railroads' which was considered much more: radical than the Esch-Townsend bill or any other prominent bill of that character. It is very likely that the views of the President and Senator Hey burn are almost identical on this line, and if there is any difference it is probable that Heyhurn be lieves m more oiiuugent regulation than Roosevelt does. 

RICH INDIAN LANDS Thrown Open to Settlers Is the Dream of Congressman French. Congressman French will intro duce a bill providing for the opening of Lie Coeur d'Alene In dians reservation in North Idaho. The bill provides that the lands of no vv Iieju by in me reservation dian in the aggregate be allotted in severalty to the Indians, and the remainder of the lands thrown open to settlement. 1't is estimated •' at after the In dians are supplied with the;?' share of the land, there will still lie over 300,000 acres of good land for set tlement. According to reports the land of this reservation is very fine and if it is thrown open there will no doubt he a grand rush to get the best land. Mr. French believes the country will be greatly benefited by this move and as a consequence much luable property will be added to the tax lists of the State.
