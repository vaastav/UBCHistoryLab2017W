Joe "Wheeler Washington, Dee. fl.—When the sen ate convened yesterday to begin tiio closing session of the Fifty-fifth con gress the chamber presented a notable and beautiful appearance. By 11 o'clock the public and private galleries were filled almost to their capacity with a distinguished assemblage, in cluding many ladies in brilliant attire. On the floor of the senate tlie display of flowers was unusually beautiful, even for the opening day of a session of congress. The odor of the flowers filled the chamber. The memorable scenes enacted in the chamber during the last session and the momentous events that have occurred since- con gress last adjourned, created a feeling of intense expectancy, both by the spectators and members of the senate. This was made manifest by the long lines of people in the corridors anxious to gain admission to the galleries, and by the early arrival of senators on the floor. Through courtesy of the vice president the members of the joint high commission were admitted to the floor of the senate and were the re cipients of much attention. During a recess of three-quarters of an nour, while the senate was awaiting the pre sentation of the message from, the president from the president, the mem bers of the joint high commission held an informal levee, greeting personally nearly all the members of the Ameri can senate. The reading of the presi dent's message, which occupied two hours and eighteen minutes, was re ceived with very careful attention for an hour, but after that the senators drifted to the cloak rooms and to the committee rooms, where they could peruse the message at their leisure in the printed copies which had been furnished, IN 

THIS HOUSE. Rondlnn: of the FollorreQ Willi Close Atcullon. Washington, Dec. G. The opening seasion of congress yesterday was a spectacular occasion, animated and brilliant. There were more than the ugual number of distinguished per sonages in the thronged galleries, in cluding many representatives of for eign governments, high officials and ladles and gentlemen conspicuous In social aud political life. Tho greetings of the members were most cordial and there was no outcropping of partisan rancor to mar the occiljiftn. One of tho most striking incidents was the coi* dial meeting between' the floor leaders of the respective sides, Messrs. Diug ley.and Bailey. In view o*!fne.gossip about the possibility of Mr. Bailey be ing deposed as the mUiority leader it is significant that thfe speaker named Mr. Bailey as the minority member of the committee to wait upon the presi dent, an honor always bestowed upon the recognized leader of the minority. Speaker Reed received a warm wel come from both sides of the bouse when he ascended the rostrum to call the house to order, but perhaps the greatest personal ovation to any mem ber was that given Maj, Gen. Wheeler of Alabama, who has not been seen by many of his old colleagues since he went to the front at the head of the cavalry division ot 5en. Shafter's army. Mr. W. A. Stone of Pennsyl vania, Mr. McMillin of Tennessee and Mr. Sayers of Texas, who have been elected governors of their respective states since congress adjourned, were also overwhelmed with congratula tions. The floral tributes were unusu ally numerous and made the hall a veritable bower of beautiful flowers. The proceedings themselves were dull, all interest centering in the reading of the presldAit's message. For over two hours the clerk droned through the long document, but the interest of tlie members and the spectators never flagged. With rapt attention they fol lowed the president's recital of tlie war, and listened, eagerly to every sug gestion or recommendation he had to offer. 1 1 No expression of approval or disapproval interrupted the reading.

Mr. Quesada, speak'ug of the Cuban commission, said: "The president's message is re-' gaided as very satisfactory. Its pub lication at this time will do good, coun teracting reports that have been spread in Cuba by people who have not the real Interests, of the country at heart. We have full faith in the Unit ed States and in the just intentions of President McKinley, and the men who have made the revolution of Cuba are fining to work with the United States to establish a government that will haVe the respect of nations. Gen. Garcia is well satisfied with the inter views lie has had with American of ficials. V-i'"'

The authorities tried to prevent this action, but ultimately the leaders of the crowd lighted the eltigy and It burned amid the cheers for Colombia and je£rs for Italy. DAY PUTS HIS FOOT DOWN Can't Stand the ^nibbling of the Spaniards. Paris, Dec. 7.—The joint peace com mission was in session, for over four hours yesterday. Much of the discus sion concerned details in the ceded colonies. The debate, was very ener getic ami the Spaniards, on emerging, appeared to be dejected. Secretary Ojeda, of the Spanish commission, when Questioned after the meeting as to the progress, made answer excited ly: "I am almost mad. I cannot talk. We are making progress." The Ameri can commissioners declined to say any thing further than that the progress made was satisfactory. The Spanish commissioners have received- authority to bind their government on certain matters, but tl»4e are yet important questions upon which their instruc tions are unsatisfactory, and it is like ly that many of the details involved iii the change of sovereignty in the Spanish colonies will be left for set tlement in the regular manner when diplomatic relations between the two countries are resumed. The history of the document which will certify tlie passing of the Oldest Colonial Power in the world and the advent of the newest was epitomized by Judge Day 1 in a single sentence: I "A peace treaty can contain any thing which the victors put into it." The Americans have listened for hours with their customary patience to tlie technicalities convoked by the Spaniards with their customary shrewdness and persistency against every proposal making for the dis memberment of their empire. Dark ness had come on and the liveried at tendants furnished by the French au thorities had had placed a tiny lamp at the elbow of each commissioner. Sen ator Frye, whose unconcealed con tempt for diplomatic quibblings ex cited the astonishment of the punctil ious Castllllans had stalked home, his patience exhausted. The burden of the Spanish arguments was that mat ters outside the bare cession and evac uatlon of the conquered territories .which the Americans proposed to cov er by the treaty, were beyond the le gitimate and customary scope of a peace treat. Behind this bulwark Senor ltios'fortified himself, bombard ing his opponents with a Supply oC Arguments and precedents which inspired the freely expressed admiration of the Americans. Finally Judge Day sum marized the American position in the foregoing. memorable utterance. It was given and taken in good spirit, aDd from that moment the proceedings were entii'ely friendly. The session accomplished much. Eight open ques tions were canvassed, seven being practically settled without noteworthy friction. The commissioners decline to say what conclusion was reached, but the bargain for a coaling station in the Carolines was not cemented, and, according to present prospects, It is likely to fail. The temper of the Americans In this matter is: "We made you a good' offer for an island. I You may take it tr leave it." I The Spanlaids seem disposed to leave it. The Americans do, not re gard It as a prize w'hlch they can de mand as one of the natural fruits of the war, w-hile the whole policy of the Spaniards is to confine the negotiations as narrowly as possible to the letter of the protocol signed in Washington, and to exclude all extraneous matters. The Spanish commissioners continue "fighting with tooth and nail to pro cure every possible pecuniary and oth er concession. A 

GIGANTIC FLOUR TRUST. \Vill Control the Product of the Country.

Mr. Glynn left London and came, at Mr. Mc-Ihtyre's invitation, to this country last summer. Together they visiterl the principal mills. Mr. Glynn, how ever, could not see a large enough ben cfit in the combination to wan-ant its formation. New York conferences "were'held in this city, but they all end ed In Mr, Glynn refusing to enter the faclicme. Mr. Mclntyre, however, was not dis couraged, and when the British mil lionaire sailed for England last Octo ber he accompanied him.. Upon arriv ing in London he canvassed the princi pal stockholders of the Pillsbiiry Washbum Milling company with such success that a special meeting was called. It was at this meeting that Mr. Mclntyre Is said to have finally convinced the stockholders and to have accomplished his purpose.
