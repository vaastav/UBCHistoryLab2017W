MIDLAND JOURNAL. RISING SUN, MD. , ■ . < MESSAGE OF WILSON ■PRESIDENT DELIVERS A SHORT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS IN JOINT BESSION. ASKS MORE RAILWAY LAWS jail* for Early Action on Remaining ' Measures of His Program of Settle ' went and Regulation—Other Legis ’ lation That Is Advised. Washington, Dec. 5. —President Wil son's message, delivered to congress In Joint session today, was brief and to the point. The president said: Gentlemen of the Congress: , In fulfilling at this time the duty laid nj>on me by' the Constitution of com niunicating to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may be .judged necessary and expedient I '-shall continue the practice, which 1 Hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which it peems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there Were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, it seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action Should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close •f your last session in view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, nnd which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. , Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house Of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate; in order that the commission may be enabled to deal With the many great and various duties •now devolving upon it with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike Of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in the work of oper ating trains in interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re-' cults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the Increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public Investigation of the merits of every auch dispute shall be instituted and Completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the power. In case of military necessity, to take Control of such portions and such roil ing stock of the railroads of the coun- try as may be required for military ■Be and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances acquire for their safe and efficient use. Renew* Hi* Recommendations. The second and third of these rec- Cmmendations the congress Immediate ly acted on: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages’ln train service and it au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; hut It postponed action upon the other The Yfear* After Fifty. When men pass the half-century mark, they usually regard themselves ■8 going down hill. A discovery which I made by talking with those who were really living In •he latter period was that many of them regarded theirVxperieuce of life In the advancing years as the best pari of the whole. It did not appear on the surface: it was not uny marked ouccess before the world, nnd it was not uppen! perhaps, to those in the • l ot many of nwiple suggestions until hn opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It neces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant an Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is Indisputably clear nnd a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission’s authority or its Inciinatidn to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the Increase in the Interstate commerce commis sion’s membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—l now very earnestly renew. . The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them in such matters would find It hard, I believe, to .excuse a failure' to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practi cally Impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but It is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. ( It must first be perfected as an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the natio.n wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere Statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the irfcrease in the effi ciency of the interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not prepared to Introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until, a public investigation shall have been which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such "principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the in dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged In pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to he legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Itico; rnd the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies In the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. ICven delay would seriousiy jeopard the interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the expenditure of money in elec told me they felt that they were liv ing the happiest days of all. There seems to be a mysterious quality of life Id these later years which is not found in the earlier part, something that is worth while in the living of it; and no one has had all of human life until he has been through' these years and found it Then, and uot before, 1 came back to the conviction that one who has at tained a Imlf-century of clean, honest living, is worthy of congratulation; that be ought to pass his fiirit ili birth- Ttons may seem to be less necessary than the Immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled; but it would greatly relieve the public mind If this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied in the light of present experience; and a delay would have tfie further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade.- That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, has indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present > laws. We should clear away all .legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing miisf be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges oi its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption ol the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them w’ili no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have tc address the Sixty-fourth congress, 1 hope that you will permit me to saj with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operateij with you in the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched th< legislative annals of the country.
