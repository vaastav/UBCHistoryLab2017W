The House of Representatives was called to order at noon by John B. Clark, the ( lerk of the House in the Fiftieth Con gress. Long before that hour the corridors of the Capitol were thronged with men. wo men and children. The doors of the House galleries were closed against them for a time Because of a ca-.icus of Democratic K-epresen-tatdves in progress, and the first tendency of the throng was to turn in the direction of the Senate Chamber, where the galleries and floor were both open. The greater interest centred in the House, and a crowd gradually assembled about its doors that packed the liallwavs end made progress through them a matter of extreme ddtieulty When the doors were thrown open not only the gal leries but The floor of the House quickly tilled with strangers. Magnificenl floral designs were carried here and there on The floor of the House by page-, and the odor of roses filled the air. A handsome but unobtrusive basket graced the Speaker's desk.

On assuming the hair Speaker Reed said: "Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I thank you for the high office which your voices have be stowed upon me. It would be impossible not to be moved by its dignity and honor; yet you may well imagine I am at this moment more impressed by its responsibil ities and duties. Under our system of gov ernment as it has been developed, these responsibilities and duties are both political and parliamentary. So far as the duties are political,? F" sincerely" hope that j they may be performed with a proper sense of what is due to all the people of the whole country. So far as they are parliamentary I hope with equal sincerity that they may be performed rwith a proper sense of what is due to both sides of the Chamber."

Flow ers adorned the seats of several Senators. At noon Vice-President Morton entered the chamber, and the Chaplain, the Rev. J. G. Butler, opened the proceedings with an invo cation for the Divine blessing, closing with tin Lord's Prayer. Senators Chandler, of New Hampshire, and Dixon, of Rhode Island, were sworn in.

M. a band o masked men came to the Upper Marlboro (Md.) jail, Overpowered the keeper and broke open the cell of Joe Vermillion, took him out anil hanged him on the bridge leading to the village.

All of the Vermillion boys were arrested on the charge of arson, but John told the officers that Joe was the cause of ad the trouble, and that he had fired the barns.

Congr essman Tom Reed, of Maine, was nominated in the Republican caucus on the second ballot for Speaker of the House of Representatives, and was elected when Con gress opened. Mr. Reed's career has been a somewhat un eventful one, being marked by little beyond his steady political promotion. He was born in the old seaport city of Portland, on the lsith of October, 1839. He was educated at Bowdoin College, at Brunswick, Maine, where he graduated at the age of twenty-one. This was in the year preceding the out break of the Civil W ar, and during the first part of that conflict Mr. Reed was engager! in the study of law. In 1864, however, on the 19th ot April, he accented an appoint ment as acting assistant paymaster in the United State.-; navy, an office which he con tinued to hold for more than eighteen months. On leaving the navy in November, 1865, after the close of the war, Mr. Reed returnee to his legal studies, and was soon afterward admitted to the bar of his native State. He commenced to practice his profession in Portland; but he took so active an interest in public affairs, and his talents drew him so rapidly to the front, that with, him lave soon became subordinate to polities. In 1W3S he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, and after serving for two years in that body became a member of the State Senate in 1S70. Then for three successive years he was Attornev-General of Maine, and for four more years City Solicitor of Portland. He was first elected to the National Legis lature in 1876, when the First District of his State chose him as its representative in the Forty-fifth Congress. He has been at Wash ington continuously from that time, and is now the foremost Republican member of the lower house. THE POSTAL SERVICE. Post mast er-G e nc ral W a i i a ma ker's Annual Report Summarized. Postmaster-General Wanamaker, in his first annual report, recommends that the offices of a Fourth Assistant Postmaster General and of a General Secretary the latter at a salary of $10,000 be made, so as to enable the head of the department to render better service. Referring to his correspondence with the Western Union Telegraph Company, Mr. Wanamaker says: tkI respectfully ask that such legislation be enacted as is necessary to empower the Postmaster-General to enter into contract with responsible parties for a term not ex ceeding five years, on conditions favorable to the Government, for the purpose of estab lishing a Limited Post and Telegraph Service." On the subject of Sunday mails Mr. Wana maker says: "I shall make use of all proper means tend ing toward the minimizing of postofnee work upon Sunday, because I believe that the Gov ernment shou'd. as far as possible, make no requirements which will prohibit its employe.-; from the enjoyment of a day of rest." In touching upon the subject of penny postage the report says: "One-cent postage is an easy possibility of the near future. It must come as a matter of course. If introduced to-morrow the cut ting in half of postage would reduce the re venue on letter postage by probably $15,000, 000. We are not ready for this while tie present deficiency exists. AVhen the blessing of penny postage comes it should not require a tax in some other form to make up its cost. Moreover, it would seem to be wiser first to improve the facilities rather than to reduce the postage while the service still remains con spicuously imperfect." As to postal savings banks, the Postmaster-General suggests that they be established at 10,000 of the fourth-class offices for the convenience of the people wanting a place to deposit their money, but expresses no opin ion on the suggestion that the Government pay interest to depositors. The reiort refers to the pressing need for the erection of a de partmental building at Washington and uros that this be done.

This will open up thousands of acres to cultivation. 

THOMAS B. REED. HEMMED IK BY FLAMES. Seven Deaths Canned by Fire in Philadelphia. Fire broke out about 2:30 a. m. in th three-story brick building at the corner ol Second and Huntingdon streets. Phiiadel phia. T.-.e basement and first floor were used by Gustave Gross as a lakeshop and store respectively. The second floor wa; occupied as a dwelling by Gr. s, his wife and four children, and on the third floor dwelt Joseph B:tner with his wife and six children. The flames, which started in the basement, burned quickly through the upper floors, and the following persons were burned to death: Mrs. Minnie Gross, Mrs. Annie Bit ner. Ida Bitner. George Bitner, Gustave Gross. Bruno Gross. Mattie Gross. As soon as the firemen learned that there were people in the house, they turned their attention to rescuing them, but th flames had already made such headway that their efforts wen- almost fruitless. Truckman Hugh Smith climbed up the awning-post ami into the second storv window. He made his way through the smoke to the bed u which little Gustave Gross lay, and picking him up, got him safe ly out of the building. The lad had. how ever, inhaled bo much smoke that he died half an hour afterward. The wife of Bitner and two of their children, Ida. aged six years, and George, a babe of nine months, were in the third-story front room and Mere suffocated by the smoke. When found bv the firemen after the flames had bet-u suiv dued. the mother and her children were hud dled together on the floor. Mrs. Bitner whs ?lad only in her night dress, but she had her shoes on, as though preparing to escape when overcome by the smoke. Mrs. Gross and her children were asleep on the second floor. She clasped her two-and-a-half -year -old daughter Mattie in her arms, and, hurrying to the third floor, jumped from a window to the street below. She was immediately con veyed with her child to the Episcopal Hos pital, a short distance away, where the child lied soon after being admitted. Mrs. Gross w as horribly burned, and in addition suffered a compound fracture of the arm. She died shortly after 5 o'clock in the afternoon. After the fire the firemen found the dead body of Bruno Gross, aged five years, in tie bathroom on the second floor, burned almost to a crisp. Freda Gross, aged seven, and Clara Bitner, aged fourteen, jumped from a second story window, and were caught in the arms of Mr. Gross. These two escaped without in jury. Fritz Erdman, an apprentice, aged fifteen, also jumped from the second story and escaped unhurt. UNCLE SAM'S NEEDS, Appropriations Required : the Next Fiscal Year.
