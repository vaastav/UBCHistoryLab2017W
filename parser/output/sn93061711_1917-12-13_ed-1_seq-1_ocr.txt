Mean while Austrla-nungnry must be form ally declnred our foe In the war, and "our present and Immediate task" le to win that war. fluch In a few words Is the message f President Wilson to congress, to America, and especially to the world. He leaves no doubt of the govern ment's and the nation's humanitarian alma, nnd he makes equslly plain the determination never to mnke peace with the present rulers of Germany who have done such "deep nnd shorn- Insble wrong." The president ex pressly dlsnvnws sny Intention to Im pair or renrrsnge the Austro-Hunga-rtan empire, but says that to the Anstro-Hungarians should be restored Independent control of their own af fairs, and overs that the Ralksn states and Turkey should be secured against foreign oppression or Injustice. Mr. Wilson's polished diction does not con ceal his contempt for the pacifists, the traitors and others who seek to ham per the nation In the prosecution of the war. When everyone else within sound of his voice arose and cheered the president's Impassioned statements, Senator La Follettr, Representative Mason and one or two more sulkpd si lent In their seats. They are easily classified. Message Warmly Approved. Instant approval of the message was general throughout the United States, and It received the henrty endorse ment of the British und South Ameri can press, though some of the London yepers, notably the Times, are skep tical about the distinction the presi dent still makes between the German ralers and the German people. It roust te confessed a great many Americans atse feel the German people nre not o guiltless ss Mr. Wilson represents them. Congress lost little ttme In stnrtlng proceedings for formsl declaration of. war agnlnst Austro-iiungary, ana gov erament agents throughout the coun try at once began preparing to handle the million nnd a half enemy aliens which It ndds to the list. As tens ofj thousands of Austro-Hungarians have beet) employed In the mines of Amer- Inn. there Is dsnger of s serious short ge of mine labor.

Qermans Try Hard fer Big Vletery. It Is evident that the Gorman high command Is trying desperately te ob tain a decisive military victory In France or Italy, or both, before the, American army gets across In suffi cient force to be effective. So fsr the reault schleved by the enemy has been, the gain of a few rods ef ground at an appalling cost In loss of life. The, fighting In the Cambral sector devel oped Into the bloodiest and fiercest battle of the war, and despite the bringing up of great numbers ef Ger many's best troops, the British In the' main repulsed the repeated mass at tacks and held most of the ground' gained the previous week. If Byng rnn continue to hang en to his posi tions, the bnttle will prove the best thing the British coals ssk, for It hss brought the Germans "out of their holes" and not only shown them up as Inferior In open fighting, but cost them nn enormons number of their most valunhle men. The reckless sac rifice miide by Crown Prince Rup precht contrast strangely with the In formation that Germany Is training boys of fifteen and sixteen to take their places soon In the fighting lines. America has cause for pride and satisfaction In tho reports that come nf the part In the Cambral fighting taken by American engineers. Caught by n sudden advance of the Germans, these men took shelter until the Brit ish come up to them, and then, borrow ing guns, went Into the fray with n gallantry and coolness that won high praise from the commanding oftcere of the British. A few ef them were killed nnd wounded, but the others went right on with their fighting, trolllng.nnd railroad, building, Fierce Fighting (n ftaTy.

C, Dec. 11 With the slogan, "Make it a Red Cross Christmas,' un effort will ho made to add 10,000,000 new members to the five million now in the organization. Only one week has been alloted to the in tensive drive, but it is expected that this will be enough. This is the first organized effort the Red Cross has made to enroll new members since the war started. The president's appeal is as follows: "To the people of the United States Ten million Americuns arc invited to join the American Red Cross during the week ending with Christmns eve. The times require that every brunch of our greut nntionnl effort shall be loy ally upheld and it is peculiarly fitting thut at Christmus season the Red Cross should liu the branch through which your willingness to help is expressed. "You should join the American Red Cross because it nlonc cun curry the pledges of Christmas good will to those who are bearing for us the real bur dens of the world wn' both in our urmy and navy nnd in the nntions up on whoso territory the issues of the world war are being fought out.

The first half was easily won by the High school but the second hnlf, with the addition of a few new pluyers, the score wus reversed. The game ended with u score of -10 to 29 in favor of the High School boys. The next thing on the program was the box supper. Many beautifully dec orntcd boxes filled with plenty of good things to cat. These boxes were sold nt auction by Prof. Criley and they brought n ncnt little sum of money. Then came the popular ludy contest. This created considerable excitement nnd the contest was quite spirited.
