Wednesday ajornin g, December 4, 1872, Th? '"reiiannt'i UeMKg?. . We printed, yesterday, ? fall synopsis of the President's message. The recom avoodatioqs ore generally judicious, end show a more comprehensive view - than usual of the .public interest* and ro Qoiremeats. At the same time, it falls abort of our juofc expectations, in many partionlare, It is matter, of, oong ra t ula lion, which the President; appropriately ncrtr?esj1 CUat ;tho vexed question of jqor relations' With 'Great' Britain 'has oVerl satisfactorily settled, and that no oloud rests.upSn them, W also that the result of the San Jean arbitration has left us ' wj^ho et t' .^4)5jfljBPnt9.08 & bounilafib^ Weare-'atpeace,with all the world, aud have a good and oyr,d,tul understanding with tho governments of Europe. In reference^ to^Gaboj Me makes, nojecom mendatioas, and indicates no, pojioy to be pursued- towards it; Not a-word is said about Mexico, Theisuggestion'tkat we maintain four American yoaths aa part of tho' diplomatics family of the nimisfcera rta?dejjt-ab each pfr tho -courts of China ;ui<3" pan, is a go oil one! The President.eohooe the pablio sentiment in advisiogrifaat oajr^eBcy-be brought to par with goiu; but is far from reflecting it in fija ^nfl yioo St hut no more "jfoduaf ion ^f toxation do attempted ut jjrcseatJby^any. legislation whatever. ? He -is ?gaiu far out of "tho path of - jmfiolons and wiso xeaommendation 'ib urging upon Con giefo io eoqaro t-itl^a'lo all the telegraph lines now in operqtjon, "and making that Mraiep. a part oi the general posiat sox vioe. 'This would be a long stride (o weffd4'"^>v^CJneuU^oodtrulx>iHue great business interests of the cocotry. Such dentation' might suit Russia or Austria, b&fc"would chafe to an insufferable de? gree tfie spirit of any free people. We have enough of despotism already insi? diously hiding iteelf under the forms of republican government The adoption of 'this measure Would be the virtual re linqai&hment^>f by th for pi pm]t spirit, i The' President refers} favorably to a proposed rq'nie to conneot tho Mississippi valley wit? ibb Atlontib.:at Charleston and Savannah by way of the Ohio and Tennessee Rlve'rsfcUtleo, to the proposed extension of the ELanawha and James River Canal - This is the only passage of' themoBsago'wbioh seems to ldt>k with -any concern or regard to waVds' th'o South. The President makes a oold reference to the Ku Klux. He is hopeful that the time is near when .their ontragos will oease, and with thorn, the necessity of prosecution of those guilty of. them. Tills is adding insult to injury.- Per? haps, though, we are expected to ad? mire the executive oloioenoy which par? dons^ gigantic defaulter like paymaster Hodge, and tue? Gato-like sternness which still coops up our poor Ku Klus innocent of any serious crime, in com? pany wilh' burglars and forgers. Hodge, though a big rogue, was a good soldier and a very loyal subject. This message, cold, oallous, indifferent, ventures not a word on the subject of paoifioation of -the? Country. The President has no salve for the' wounds of war, nO balm to offer for the distress of one great wronged section.' He disappoints the weli-foanded hopes of all trne lovers of the conn try, of all who would close up the ugly soars of sectional strife, aud obliterate the memories of a bloody ? etvil oontcst. He eould do much to pro? mote the spirit of peace, and to soothe tho irritations wbioh yet romain. But he says not a word, and idly throws away a groat opportunity to advance his own famo in rendering what would be at onco a great and easy - servico to the wholo country. Parties in Franob.?In view of re? curring politioal agitation in France, nnd the frequent reference made in the cable despatches to tbo several party divisions in the French Assembly, tho following will be useful for reference: First, tbo extreme "loft" or radical wing consists of about seventy members, whoso cbiof exponent is Louis Blaue. Second, the republican loft or modorato republicans, aboat ICO in number, of whom Grevey is a fair typo. Third, tho left contio, or still moro moderato republicans of tho conservative school, with about 110 mem bors, under the lead of Ghasnoy. Fourth, the centre right or Orleanisls, about 100 in number, with sovcral titled loaders. Fifth, the right or monarchists, who prefer Henry V or VI. They number about 120. Sixth, tho exlromo right or ultra-monarchists, numbering about sixty deputies, who are waiting for Hen? ry and his whito flag, under tho lend of Count de Benuregard. No party has a majority, and therein lies tho stronglh of Thiers. - <-+???-? It has beon demonstrated in New York that plate glass windows aro ineffootual in stopping runaway oxon. TU?

Tho Governor spoHo at soojo fangtn. His language and stylo were superior, to hits matter, whiou was mostly of the.old staple, and spunded, ,iu parts as if it had been.plagiarized from Gov. Scott's fare? well. He, too, as Weiras Soott, had a fling at the "governing classes" of a for I mer day, and their suicidal conspiracy against the flnanbial credit of the State, their intolerance of political opponents, and their instigation of armed bodies to persecute and kill those of political ob jedtiouable opinions. He, too, as well as Scott, wus profoundly thankful that the United Stated Government had come to' (beaid of? the itabooile Stute authori? ties, and had effaotually put down this formidable rebellion.' .Fu.'ng stirred these fading embers awhile, ai.d resusoi tatedb,greatly ,to the delight of tho groacdliqgs, the monjlqr Ku Klax, and killed it afreah; and.trtunpled itjover and over ogaiu under foot, he turned his view over the State, and found every? where spreading a prospect of peace, good order, sens a of justip'e/. and happy spirit of toleration. Its prosperity he had celebrated at tho outset as something remarkable and extraordinary. So, toe, Go v. Scott thinks all is couleur de rose with these officials. But . '"Optics Bharp it takes, I woon, T6 aeo what Is not to bo Boon." I The, Governor followed this up with somo suggestions, to the mon of his own raae to bo more tolerant to their dusky brothers,'' In the hush of posBion and in the stilling of ioterneoine strife, the dawn of a brighter future would be seen. Immigrants and capital would follow the banishmout of seatioualisin, &o. While he is in tho humor of giving advice, and as be has tho' bar of the colored people, it would be well, and keep the balance even, if he would. say a word to them against the execrable habit they havo of burning houses, cotton, ootton gins, &o. The Governor promised to stand upon the platform? of ^ isparty.He regarded it as tho authoritative exposition of his official duty.' This was tho best part of his speech, and for-this we oommond him heartily. The oath was adminis? tered by Chief Justice-Moses, tho good book was kissed, the band struck up Yankee Doodle, and followed it with Dixie, and the ceremony of inauguration was over. >

The earth has rewarded tho labors of our husbandmen with abundant fruits, while all (ho varied forma and arts of industry arn being prosecuted with hupetul energy, amid apparently universal peauo and order, under our happy system of govern? ment, which guarantees and maintains liberty regulated by law. Wo havo been mercifully exempt from tho great aud disastrous tiros which, during (lie past year, havo swept over h > many portions of our common country, consuming to ashes I tho garnered wealth of yoars, and reducing tho rich and tho poor to the samo lovel of in I digent sutleriug. Let us endeavor, follow* ' citizens, to deuervo these signal blessings, by . falikfol '*n^KJ5^I63tI?\f* tTTiohlTlSffTSr *? the Important truet* ropoaed in na bj the people. In entering npoa the dot loa of the high office.with whioJt?

To this eud. I in Yc-ko the considerate Ju 'g ment and active eo-oporation of every m? m ber of the Oenoral Aaaembly, whatever may bo hi j party creed, and the opou aid and aa aiatanco of every good citizon in the common wealth of South Carolina. While I ahail1 dot forget that, aa a Candi? date, 1 rupruaeutodJu my parson tho Union Repub?cin pirty, whose boooflcent princi? ples-are axproueul in. the doctrine of cqqial rights and exact juiticoto all inon?now in? corporated aa' the fundamental law-of the 8tate -aud nation?and while ander any and all circumstances my doty of deTUtion and fidelity to my party aball be ever present t>> my mind, I truattbat I may always remember ?hit, as the Uhlof Magistrate of the State, I repreeent all tho people of Booth Carolina, aud that tho lines which limit my z-jal for their hit tc at a must, in honor,-be co-extensive with her hound*rien. Standing hero to-day in the angust preaenoo of the assembled law-makers of the State, aud of this large multitude, with the oath of olTlco in all ita solemn sanctity fresh upon ray lips, I pledge my bOBt efforts to insure that, during ruy admin in t ration, "the commonwealth shall suffer no detriment." Oeutlemcn of the Senate and House of Hep reaontativesi :let us redediaate ourselves to tho great work and duty of the hour. Let na firove to the world, by the enaotnicnfc of just aws. and t heir impartial administration, that tho highest private liberty here is consonant with ilis greatest publib ?ood. Oufffooplo are happy in the possession of a bountiful sotl aud a genial climate. Here the varied prodnota of-the temperate and tropic zones grow-'side by aide, wbilo onr atreams are dishing in the sun-light of a perpotual spring. The itnporiai plant, whose floeoy fibres enter into the raimont of civilized man throughout the globe, aud whoao production presses heavily upon tbe very balance wheelB of the commercial exchanges of tbe world, has bore its nativo homo and most luxuriant growth. Yet the face of the immigrant is turned away from our State, and capital, which sets labor in motion, and creates the manufactures which contribute to the com? fort and tho elevation of man, shrinks'back from ua, as if tho -seals of peatilonce wots broken, and its vials emptied ont upon this boautitul land of ours. Hence, nearly three lourtho of our vast territorial area, embrac? ing not lees than 30.000 square miles, lie fal? low to-day. This disastrous result ie largely due to the fell spirit of political inloleranoo which Las been manifested daring the past live years by the former governing olaen in South Carolina, who still, in groat part, rep? resent the educated intelligence aud landed propert} of tbe ?tite. l'hat intolerance, which was at lirut successfully directed to destroy the nnuiit.-i.il credit of tbe Stato Go? vernment, both' at home and abroad, also proscribed every uativu aud adopted citizen who opeuly declared himself in au. 1 with tbe political sciuimants which wore enter? tained by tuevaU majority of tho people of tho Uni tod States, who have, by the result of the recent national campaign, furnished a moat memorable proof of their firm deter? mination that only those who are known to rtllect dud maintain thoso political senti? ments shall rule in this republic of cars. Individual proscription aud habitual denun? ciation of tho Government, both the State and Federal, were soon followed by armei1 organizations in various sections of the State, which, led by bold, bad and designing men, overawed by their number and daring the law-abiding majority, and soourged and .dew ttauy ot their fellow-citizens, beuauae of thoir pilitical opinions and party affiliation. These barbarous acts of a minority of the minor party in tho State continued, with varying intensity, for a long and dark period of more than three yoars. Tbe Government of the Slate having lnudo ineffectual attempts to chock them, both by earnest appeals to tho reason aud humanity of thofo who were re? garded a? the political leaders and exponents of the desperate men eugaged iu them, and by its available constabulary forco, finally appealed to the national authority for protec? tion to American citizens from lawless vio luueo within the limits of tho state. Tbat appeal?after long delay, incident to procur? ing the necessary legislation by the Congress of tho United States?was effectively re? sponded to through tho Federal courts, sus? tained oy tho mnuary arm or tue oovcrn tueut. As the rosult of that iutorvonliou, for which our most profound gratitude is duo to the Government of the United Staloe, many hundreds of the persons engagod iu those lawless undertakings?ao abhorrent to our free institutions and to the civilization of the age?bavo been arrested and imprisoned, under sentence, while mauy more, charged with having been engaged in them, have, through a seuso of their guilt, fled beyond the borders of our Stato. Turning away from tho recollection of those scene*, which wero so utterly, revolting to all true lovers of liberty, 1 am happy to an? nounce tbat poaco and good order now pre? vail everywhere within tho Stato, which seem to bo accompanied by a returning tjuuso oi justice, aud by a broader spirit of toleration in tho hitherto ruling classes, which famish a bettor guarantee for their continuance than tho more temporary presence of the sword or hayouet can over give among a froe people, The grand juriea of several Counties in the uppor part of tho Stato, which were tho elm 1 scenes of tho armed violence aimed at the vested rights of American citizous, havo re? cently expressed a becoming contrition, and, apparently sincere regret and Borrow, I hat this violence should hilVO been permitted tC manifest itself, unchecked by tho local autho? rities iu their several Comities, and solemnly uludga those citizens who bavo heretofore been presumed to havo given acquiescent .-unction to fiese atrocities, t hat henceforth they will actively exert themselves to maintain law and order, autl will protect, by force oi arm-*, if necessary, a?y citizen whose politi? cal rights or personal privileges may bo as? sailed. Ad Governor of this Stato, and an tho politi? cal ally nud personal friend of many of those who havo bueu stricken down by this urrucd Violence. Whoso memories I wear within my heart of hearts, 1 welcome this plodgo to which I havo referred, aud earnestly trust that it will buspoodily aud o:nstautly ratified by tho conduct of those iu whoso behalf it baa been given. The giand juries havo accompanied tli030 gratifying assurances by tho indictment of a largo 'number of persons, ohargoablo with having boon aolora in th<*so unholy and crimi? nal combinations. 1 havo been iuforined by members of your rospoctivo I louses, who have lived in tho disturbed portions of South Caro? lina, that this happy change, iu the section referred to, is, to soino extent, due to the fear? less uctiou of the Judge or the Sixth Circuit. For this ho deserves and should receive the thanks of onr people. Let us indulge tho not altogether unwar? ranted hope that tho dawn of a brighter future has broken upon South Carolina, and that tho passions which havo no long vexed her ponpie with internecine strife, anil Ilm hates wnich sprung from domestic war, have spent their last red ripples within her bor? ders. Wbilo thn exhibition and indulgence of hiioh passions and hates might sometime* enable a political party to win, by them tho people of tho Stato must always loso. 1 therefore appeal to tho mon of my own race, in South Carolina, iu tho common inte? rest of her whole people, to plaoo tbemaolvos abreast with tho advancing civilization of tbe nge, and cultivate a nobler spirit of toleration, worthy of tho ancient renown of tho State. Garner up, ir you choose, all that yon may justly deem honorable iu the mouldering"tra ^<PUum"pf 'Wf pcouhn, tfai wfcih ?>H ential tread near the graves of the brave and dsvoted men1 who; howerer 1tni?taken they may bam been, died willingly la/defanca of what they believed the right.- Bat doal more lastly and kindly with our dark /Oater-hro there of the Bt*\e.

I ailuuu iu-the den?u of the lion. Horace Grecley, which occurred on tbo evening of the 29th ultimo, and' which iuuv bo considered as a national calamity". History is but the record of the lives and deeds of the few men who have been either the benefactors or the acourgea of their race. This man was in bis sphere illustrious above most of his co-laborers in the eervioe ren? dered hv him to the oanse tit Immun rivMa during the past quarter of a century. Stand? ing . at the hoad of a great journal, "whose pages wore . disseminated as widely as tho Engtit-h language It reif, he did as much as any of his cotemporariea to mould the opi? nions of the representative men of his gene? ration, and to establish and vindicate tho beneficent system of fieo government now incorporated into the organic law of this na? tion. . :. ? Springing from the toiling millions of the people, ho never forgot hie origin, but was always, amid his well-deserved wealth and eminence, the outspoken champion of ' tho Coor and tho oppressed, and of the rights of la or. No.man was more uncharitable in epoecb than he, and never was, man more charitable in deed. Possessed of a 'hardy and rugged honesty, whic h the breath of slander dared not assail, even iu the fierce heat of a politi? cal canvass, distinguished for its bitter and malign personalities, be never, whero princi? ple (as ho saw it) was involved, sacrificed the right to tho expedient, but always preferred,' in maintaining his convictions, rather to break than to bend. His fame will be na? tional property, und will continue, for many rears, to rtfleet luatro upon his Country; while Uio colored race, whom ho aided so much to Tcliovc from chattol and civic bond? age, will, in gratefully cherishing tbo memory of bis noblo service, forget bis ono grievous fault. In conclusion, follow-citizons, I would do in* jintico to the impulses of my heart should I fail, on such au oooabion as tho present, to recognize and gratefully acknowledge the services rendered to the cause of free govern? ment iu South Carolina by my distinguished prcdecossor. First entering the State as a prisoner of war, whoso command was defeat? ed without dishonor, he was duly exchanged, allor long confiucment in a military prison, aud at the cloao of hostilities iu the field re? turned, with promotion to tbo rank of Major General of tho United States army, to ad? minister tho affairs of an important bureau of the Government in our state. In that ca? pacity ho organized tho labor system on a free basis, protecting alike the rights of the omployor and tho labor* r. His administra? tion as tho Governor of South Carolina is be? fore tho country, and by tbo country it will bo judged. Whatever that judgment may be, I but express tbo opinion of thoso who know him best, when 1 say that he has endeavored to discharge the duties of his high office iu tho intorosts or the party that elected him, and for tho welfaro of tho people or tho State. With a solemn appreciation of the grave roeponeibility imposed upon me in the per? formance of my duties, and in tho earnest hopo that the important matters involved iu the situation before us may bring about tbo utmost concort and unanimity of action, 1 commond your deliberations to tho inerciiu! superintendence of that Almighty Tower which presides ovor States and nations. Tho constitutional oath of office was then administered to tho Governor eleot, by the lion. F. J. Mosos, Chief Justice of tho Supremo Court of South Carolina. Tho joiut assembly tbon dissolved, and the House adjourned until to-mor? row, at 12 M. Tho cholera is raging in Khiva.
