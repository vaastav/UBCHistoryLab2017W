TWELVE PAGES CHOLERA MUST BE EXCLUDED. The Dispatch strongly advocated the suppression of immigration when the dan ger of importing cholera first became evi dent For the time being the country escaped the scourge by means of good fortune eked out with the enforcement of stringent quarantine regulations. But the almost certainty of the disease's reap pearance in the spring is now universally acknowledged, and the necessity for ex cluding immigrants is generally recog nized. Postmaster General Wanamaker is the latest of the administration to in dorse the bill suppressing immigration for one year. He urges that the expenditure of 520,000,000 on the World's Fair already calls for the expenditure of more in order to assure its success by preventing the im portation of a deadly disease. The Dispatch held, and still holds, the opinion that the President had the power to suppress immigration by proclamation. But the proposed bill will make assurance doubly sure, and should become law with out opposition. Looking at the matter from the Postmaster General's point of view, expenditures in perfecting protec tions against the importation of disease will prove a profitable investment. The loss of life which would result if the disease gained an entrance to this country cannot be computed in dollars, nor can even the disturbances in commerce that its advent would bring. Immigration should be suppressed at the first sign of such danger as this, and there Bhould he preparations made to improve quarantine arrangements and prevent any excuse for conflict between Federal and State authorities. 

WHAT 'WILI. TURN UP. The first daj's proceedings of Congress Idicate a waiting game on both sides. An attitude of expectancy is not unusual at the assembling of this body; but the cir cumstances of this session accentuate the disposition of both parties to do little more than to await the moves of their antag onists. The Democrats are naturally dis posed to put things off until the day when in the possession of full power they can carry out the programme they may plan. The Republicans even more naturally hold off because the initiative properly be longs to the party which was victorious at the late election, and will have control of the Government after this session is ended. If this is to be the rule of action throughout the session Congress might well pass the appropriation bills and ad dress itself to legislation of a mm-partban character. There are some very needful measures which have been long neglected because Congress could not spare from political maneuvers the time necessary to pass them. If the present state of affairs should permit the enactment of measures like the bankruptcy bill, and others ex clusively in the public interest and with out political effect, it would be an unex pectedly gratifying result of a peculiar situation. But it is hardly to be hoped that the ses sion will proceed very far before the po litical "fight commences. Perhaps the President's message to-day may set the forces in motion. The interesting ques tion is whether General Harrison's closing message will be Inspired by aggressiveness or neutrality. THE 

PANAMA MORAL. The exposure of the Panama Canal job bery is enlarged by details as to another featuie which completes the picture. It is asserted that proofsof the bribery of the press are forthcoming, showing that for sums ranging from $5,000 to 530,000 a half dozen of the prominent journals of Paris were induced to betray the interests of their constituents by bolstering up what they knew to be the desperate mismanage ment of the company. This detail rounds out the typical picture of corporate plun der of the public on the huge scale, ac companied by the corruption of politics and the press for the purpose of securing toleration while the plunder was being carried on. Seme shades of American public opin ion are disposed to regard this scandal as an occasion for thanking Providence that we are not like other nations. It would not be wise to lay that flattering unction to our souls. It Is certain that the meth ods which resulted so disastrously In the Panama Canal frauds have been practiced more or less extensively in our own happy land, and it is by no means so certain that they are not now in-course of repetition. It would be too optimistic to be confident that the scheme of getting the pledge of government credit to the extent of $100, 000,000 on a 565,000,000 work has not ex tended its ramifications of dishonest inter est among those elements of politics an d the press which are urging it. But the affair has an entirely different application, which, though in danger of being over looked, is really far more cogent than the question already raised. In the discussion of corporate methods one of the most frequently employed and final arguments on the corporate side is the example of the older world. There these questions, we are told, have been settled scientifically. With the prece dents of France, England and German', those who have desired to reform abuses in accordance with the principles of American law have been frowned down. Now when It is discovered that the great est figures in European corporate enter prise have conducted their operations on the familiar principles of public plunder, and the connivance of legislation and the press is secured by taking In legislators and newspapers as sharers of the booty, does not that argument for the justifica tion of corporate methods here have a de cidedly reactionary effect? The Panama Canal frauds prove the necessity the world over for bringing cor poratq operations within the restrictions of honesty and law. The, United' States, as the country where the people's inter ests professedly form the purpose and foundation of government, should be the leader and originator in such reforms. THE REASSURING SIDE. Few stories of more thrilling character are told either in real life or in fiction than the one just related to the world of the voyage of the 700 souls on board the steamer Spree for a thousand miles, with the doubt hanging over them whether the next half hour might not be their last The details of that story as they are given to us by cable need no embellishment The first effect of the narrow escape is to increase the sense of the perils which surround those who go down to the sea In ships. But, on consideration, the affair has an aspect which, while it does not take away the danger, shows that prog ress is being made In overcoming it The Spree is one of the few vessels that has met such a danger without coniplete loss. The accident to the City of Pans, of simi lar character, was another demonstration of the progress of naval architecture. A few years ago such an accident to any steamer would have sent her to the bottom in fifteen minutes. Ever since the introduction of water-tight compartments, as a guard against sinking, the carelessness which leaves the com partments open has lost many lives. But the case of the Spree shows that these compartments can save a vessel from sink ing and can be kept closed against the moment of need. The fact that the fcpreo underwent this accident and yet brought her living cargo safe into port demon strates the efficiency of the modern im provements to secure safety at sea. Still this reassuring view of the case should not prompt false security. The narrow margin between life and death for seven hundred people is an impressive ar gument that machinery should not break down at sea where the consequences may come so near to "fatality. Engineering science should address itself to making machinery that will not fail in that dan gerous way. When that is done the safety of ocean travel will be nearly as complete as its comfort and speed. A KEGBXAE DISCLAIMEK. The officers of the new organization of wire manufacturing interests formed the other day took especial claims to deny that it was a trust or combination in the sense of controlling all or nearly all the production and being able to exact extrav agant prices. This is the stereotyped an nouncement even when the real trusts are formed. But the assertion is better sub stantiated than usual, with the fact that out of 40 wire concerns in the country onlv five are included in this consolida tion, and they have long been practically under the same ownership. So long as this is the case the new con solidation has nothing about it obnoxious to the public interest While there are thirty-five independent concerns it is plain that no suppression of competition or arti ficial enhancement of prices can be ef fected by the consolidation of five others. Still the suspicious may suggest that the organization, like the actress criticised by .Queen Gertrude, "doth protest too(much." It is possible that a consolidation of the magnitude reported may be made the means of merclng the other concerns into the fold, until that exclusive control of the market sought by the typical Trust is insured.- However that may be in the future, it is only necessary to say that consolidations for greater convenience of ownership or efficiency of management are not matters for public criticism; but combinations to engross the market and monopolize pro duction are obnoxious. The present is an extremely bad time to start combinations of the latter class, especially in the public interest NOT 

ENOUGH KAIN FOK THE COST. The last rain-making experiment of General Dryenf urth's corps in Texas per mits a claim of a minimum of results for a maximum of noise. It Is reported that the scientific rainmakers claim to have "proved the theory of producing rain by concussion." But when we read the de tails the theory appears to hfve received, an amount of proof the reverse of flitter ing to it The account of the manner in wliich the heavens were bombarded for hours is cal culated to produce an aching effect on the tympanum even by a reading. After the balloon explosions had shocked the cir cumambient atmosphere for some hours clouds began to appear. The stunning incantations of the rainmakers were con tinued, and finally the proof of theory was completed in the shape of a mist which lasted for twenty minutes! This may demonstrate the theory of producing rain by concussion, but it does not wet the arid earth to any appreciable extent To crack the sky from zenith to horizon, to split the ears of the dwellers on earth, and to spend some thousands of dollars all for the re ward of producing a twenty-minute mist is a species of demonstration so conclusive that we do not need any more of it Bain at that price costs more than it comes to. We do not think any more mists are wanted at the cost of a dynamite bombard ment It is reported that General Dryen furth intends to pursue his experiments next year in South Dakota; but if he does it should not be at the cost of the public funds. THE GERMAN EXPOSURE. The era of exposing scandals has seized the German administration in its grasp. Theiliscovery that the Lowe rifles, with which a large portion of the German army is equipped, have turned out to be in ferior in quality, and are reported in many cases to be absolutely useless, is of start, ling character, and may be followed by re sults of Continental extent. The first aspect in wliich this discovery presents itself is that of the possible mili tary results that may follow the knowl edge that about half the German army is practically disarmed. It suggests the idea that France and Germany may have changed the places they occupied In 1870 as regards preparation for war, and that this may be seized by the French as the opportunity for which they have waited over twenty years. The world will await with interest the international conse quences of this exposure. But 'an even greater significance of this dishonestv in Government work is its inti mation of a social change. It is to be re membered that for over a generation Ger man administration, and (.especially the Prussian military administration, has been remarkably free from Buch scandals. The entire nation seems to have been Inspired with the ambition of doing the most faith ful and intelligent work: to advance "Ger man' interests and increase the German I power. It was due to that svlrit of energy ; ..-" - - n'V'- - 1 K 1 and honesty that the German army at tained that wonderful effectiveness that enabled it to win the victories of five years which raised Prussia from a second-class kingdom to a first-class empire. Does this exposure signify that the in fluences have change'd and that greed and dishonesty are already sapping the quali ties which form the foundations of Ger man greatness? Let us hope not for the sake of human Drocress. A.sin2le scandal 'even of this magnitude does not demon strate an era of corruption. But it is plain that for the maintenance of Germany's reputation and the .continuance of her power such dishonesty requires prompt and severe suppression. Congress is once again to make more or less attempt to manugo the business of the country. Yesterday it confined Itself to a meeting and an adjournment. It lias been known to db worse, and occasionally it does bettor. To-day it is expected to accomplish one piece of necessary and Important busi ness, at least. It will listen to tlio Presi dent's fl Itoen thousand word message. That ought to be enough to keep it out of mis chief for one day. Death-bed repentances are not worth, a great deal, but they are bet ter than death without repentance. In this last session the Fifty-second Congress has a last opportunity to ntiena to the nation's business for tho nation's benefit. If it use It by refusing to waste the nation's time and the nation's money.it will pats into his tory with a more savory reputation than the one which its performances so far have been building up. It is never too late to mend, and the Fifty-socond Congicss had better mend late than never. What n different world this will be wnen people devote half the time to the cor rection of their own laults that they now spend in carping at those of others, and when charity is half as conspicuous as sclf righteoasnoss is to-Jayl The will of the late J. D. Bernd is re markable for its author's reco-rnition of tl.9 good done by societies widely separated from that ot W hick he was n member. It Is a spirit of seeking, seeing and aiding goo J work wherever it Is to bo found that best helps, on the progress of humanity. The narrow vision that is confined to the benefi cence of this or that cllquo of people limits its possessor's enjoyment of life no less than his usefulness to the race. Another feature of the instrument which is worthy of com mendation is the recognition of the testa tor's employes. Such nn incident as this, which indicates tbe existence of a desirable relationship between man nnd master, is es pecially welcume at a time when its too general absence is one of the prime factors in the production of labor troubles. Pianoforte workers are about to form a labor union for their own protection. Some day the unmusical and musical public will realize the necessity lor united action against the ubiquitous piano-thumpers. Iris reported that a new disease has broken out among the pork packers in Cincinnati. Its symptoms are ulcerous sores on tbe hands, and its cause is supposed to be due to some acid used in curlni; the meat handled by tbe sufferers. This is a matter for a very thoiongh investigation. The meat Itself may provoke similar troublo for the consumers, and in any case there must be considerable danger to tbe pub lic from its contact with tbe af flicted men. The health officers of the Queen City should lose no time over looking into the matter, and adopting measures for the safety of those under their direct care as well as those whom the pork reaches after it passes from their jurisdic tion. Thanksgivino is over, so that a short age in cranberries can be met with compar ative equanimity. But the Christmas turkey will feel'' terriblv lonesome without the usual piquant trimming. There can'not be too many institutions for the cure of drunkenness. The more op portunities the drunkard has to cast off the rvJce which force of habit has too often de veloped into a disease, the more chance there will be of lessening the number of such unfortunates and tbe better it will bo for society at large. Experiment is tbe only test of successfnlness in this matter, and the advent of a now agency with this cure as its object is a matter for publio congratu lation as affording a wider sphoro for ex periment, and as an additional factor in coping with the evil. The world professes to execrate the systems by which Jay Gould accumulated his colossal wealth. Yet tbe world must hold him a successful man according to its own standard of success. Pittsburg's needs as a city roust surely be manifest to over' thoughtful citizen. The municipal platform which best prom ises to satisfy those needs is the criterion by which tbe eloction of city officers should be decidod. There is more than enough timber in tbe woods for the construction of such a platform, and tbe sooner it is brought out of the woods and put into shape by competent workmanship the better for all concerned. Those obstreperous or supposedly ob streperdns New York Democrats must not .forgot 'the danger of playing witli edged tools. There is a sharpness which at times cuts home. Now that campaign literature has served its purpose for a time, "leave to print" will be less conspicuous in the bulkiness of the Congrcsrtonal Record than it was during tho last session. That ought to be quito a lactor in helping to leduce the expense ofgovern uient, if Congress shows any inclination to ward economy. PEOPLE OP PR0MISEKCE.

THE 

POPULAR PLURALITY. A oiikat many inquiries have reached The Dispatch as to the popular plurality for President at the recent election. Tbe official I eturns in a dozen States baVe not yet been received, and even if thev were at band tho figuring out or tho plurality in the entire country is a difficult task lor several rea sons. For ono thing, there is not and cannot be an official plurality for Cleveland, Barrl spn or any other Presldental candidate, be cause they are not voted for directly. In a State hore a drzen Republican or Demo cratic electors are chosen thero may be, and usually is, a difference of several hundred or thousand vof es between tho highest and lowest candidates on the lespoctive tickets. On this point each calculator must be a law unto hlmseir. Some autliritlcs take the heads or the tickets and reach the plurality in that way. Others average the votes cast lor the candidates on each ticket, and still otbei stake the electoral nominee of each party receiving the highest vote end decide that the difference between them is the plurality in tho State. These variations of opinion have exUtcd at every Presldental contest, and it has been very rarely that two estimates have exactly agreed. For in stance the Now Yoik Tribune Almanac places Cleveland's plurality in 18S3 at 93,554, the Chicago Daily News Almanao at 96,653 and the New York World Almanac at 98,017. There aro a number of complications this year, too, which did not exist in 188. In tho Stato of Kansas tho Weaver electors re ceived, in round numbers, 162,000 votes. Tbe HariUon electors necured 157,000 votes, and, as there was no Democratic ticket in the field, not ono votn was cast for Cloveland electors. A largo number of Democrats, probably 75,000, voted for the People's party ticket. If theie bad been a division of tbe electors as a result of the fusion a division of tbe votes wo ild have to be mado in pro portion in estimating tho popular plurality. But there was no such arrangement, and the Democratic vote was cast solidly for the Weaver ticket. A9 it result, while Harrison lost the electoral vote of Kansas, he re ceived 157.0C0 more votes there than Cleve land, nnd must bo so credited in estimating the popular pluiality or the country. Kinsas is not alono in this lespect, though it is tho most conspicuous example Deals or a similar natuie weie made by the Demo crats in Colorado, North and South Dakota, Wyoming nnd Idaho. In none of these States wore any votes cast for a straight Demo ciatio electoial ticket, and on a strict con struction Harrison's plurality over Cleve land in each and all of them is the exact number of the ballots given to tbe Republi can e eo ors. From a stralcdc standpoint these combinations made by the Democratic managers were good politics, and in a close contest the doctoral votes affected would have thrown tbe Presidency into the Demo cratlcHouse, but at the pamo time they have lcduced Cleveland's total plurality by per haps 15J.003. Alabama causes another complication which is even more difficult to adjust. The electoral ticket placod in the field by tbe Kolb convention was not formally pledged to any Presldental candidate. It was in dorsed by tbe Republican National Commit tee, and if successful tbe vote of Alabama would have been unquestionably cast for Hanison. In view ot these facts it would seem proper to place the popular vote se cured by this unsuccessful electoral tieket in the Harrison column. Tlioro was, how ever, a third so-called straight Republican ticket placed in tbe field by a disgi untied faction, composed almost entirely of colored men. A somewhat similar state of affairs pre vailed in Texas. There tho organization was in the hands of tho colored contingent, and theirs was the regular ticket, receiving about 77.C00 votes. Anothor set of electoral candidates, tue nominees of the lily white Republican party, had something over 3,000 supporters. Both tactions wero lor Presi dent Hairison, and there is a question whether their votes should not bo added to gether in computing the Republican strength in Texas, though they were thrown for opposing electoral candidates. Then there is Ohio, where the electoral vote ta'divlded and Caltfprnlu, where tho final canvass of the official returns will probably show a mixed i esult. But in these States, while there is doubt as to tjie-propor method of calculation, the margin' is so nar low that the popular plurality in, the coun try will not bo greatly affected. Os tho basis outlined the official returns received and estimates on tbe States which have not yet reported indicate a plurality of about 270,000 for Presidont-elcct Cleveland in tho U States. From several of tho far Wostern Slates, such as Nevada, North Da kota and Idaho, and some Southern States, tho figures so far are incomplete, and tho final announcement may affect the plurality given to the extent of possibly 10,000 votes either way. By other methods of computa tion which might bo adopted tbe result would vary to a still gi eater extent. A number of curious features are disclosed by an examination of the returns in some States. In Mississippi, for instance, Harri son received overSO.OCO voles in 1S83 and only 1,400 this year. Cleveland received 85,000 votes four ycais ago ana but 10,C00 this time. This decrease is tbo result of tbe adoption of the new Constitution, making tho ability to read and write a necessary qualification for suffrage. In Massachusetts, Ion a and Minnesota, wheie the Democrats expocted great gain, tho Republicans secured their usual large majorities. In Ohio, Illinois and California, making but litiln noise in the campaign, there was a surprising slump. If tneie had been no combination with Weaver Cleveland's popular plurality would not have been far short of half a million. As it is the final figures will be found close to 270,000. L. D. B. 

BABBING OUT IHMIGBAHTS, Postmaster General 'Wanamaker Thinks They Should Bo Kept Out'in '03, Wasbihqtok, Doc. 6. Postmaster General Wanamaker to-day, in speaking about the danger from an epidemic of cholera in this country next year, said that, in his opinion, tbe danger was Imminent, andiio'tlitug short of complete exclusion of immigrants for at least one year would save us from the dreaded scourge. Mr. Wanamaker thought in view or tbe fact that we had' already spent about $20,000,003 In preparation for tbe World's Fair, we ought to take no chances of its failuie by neglecting every precau tionary measure, including complete exclu sion of immigrants. As a result of the investigations mado last session by Congressional committees into tho necessity of modifying tho existing im migration laws, so as to restrict the number of paupers and other undesirable immi grants fiom foreign countries who may enter the United states and of tbe more recent Inquiry made inNew York by Senator Chandler's speoial committee, the Senator has prepared a bill suspending all immigra tion, eTcept from North and South America, lor one year.

Under these oircnmxtances it would bo inexcusable if Homestead's uniortunate snfferors should go hungry for a single day.

Morning Greeting In Chicago. Washington Post.J ' The latest Chicago greeting: "Good morn ing: have yon been robbed!" WON BY A HEBE ROSE. A Railroad Company Barely Knocked Out In the Supreme Court. Washisotos-, Dec 5. Tho United States Supreme Court to-day affirmed tho judg ment of the Circuit Court in tho well-known Chicago lake front cases. The lower court decided lii lavor of tbe local authorities, and heid that the Illinois Central Railroad did not bavo a riiht to use tbe submerged lands albng the lake front for wharves, piers, etc. The caso arose over suits between the Illinois Central Railroad and the people of tbo State of Illinois, the city of Chicago and tbe United States regarding titlo to sub merged lands about.l miles of tho water front of the most valuable part of the har bor or Chicago, tho value of the property In litigation bclna estimated at from $9,000,000, according to the figuro given In court by Connsi-1 Jewett, or the Illinois Central, to $i0 000,000, the largest estimate made. Justice Field delivered tbe opinion of the court. Tho Chief Justice, having been of counsel in the court below, and Justice flatchford being a stockholder in the Illinois Central Company, did not take any part in tbe consideration or declninn of these cases. Justices Brown andGrayJnlned Justice Shiras in dissenting. Tho citvor Chicago nnd she State or Illinois thus won the case by the narrow majority of 4 to 3. The four Justices in lavor of tho cltvare Justices Field, H trlan, lAinar and Brewer. The opinion of JusticeField is one of gi eat importance, aside even from the ereat value of tho ptopeity in controversy. Tr.e decis ion will likely form a landmark in future litigation. To a considerable extent It lays down new law. Tbo controllinz spirit of the decision Is the sovereignty oX the peo ple over even their own Legislatures. The court rules that tho railroad company's claim to ownership is well lounded so mras tbe piers do not extend beyond the point of navigability in the waters of tho lake. The opinion siys the court sees no valid objec tion to tho compiny's continuing to nse the land it Is at present ocenpring on reclaimed ground for use as a railioad passengnr sta tion, and lor tracks in approaching and leav ing said station.

CBAKBEEEIES FOB CHBISTMA3. f Philadelphia Wholesalers Corner the Mar ket and More Thau Double Prices. PntLAOSLFUiA, Dec. 5. Special Some ap prehension is felt among tbe retail grocers or the oity, tbe hotels, restaurants nnd housekeepers, because of tbo growing scarcity of cranberries. For a week past se oral of the larger firms have bad men all over Now Jersey trying to b3y up all the berries in siiht. In some cases they were successful, but many of them came back empty-banded. Nearly all the berries have been bought up, and what remain in Jersey aro held by the growers for a still further In crease in price, which, from all appearance, 'is sure to como before Christmas. It is said that this security and high price are caused by the effort or a Saw firms in this city to corner the market. Last year the supply was plentiful, so that few dealers speculated in them, but this tall tbo crop was considerably lighter. These Arms which make a specialty in the cran berry line saw an opportunity to send the Snces up. Tliey marled men out through urlingtou, Ocean. Gloucester and Atlantic counties, to buy up all the beirles obtaina ble. Soon nnotberfirm got an inkling of what was going on and tney too put men down in the swamps lor the same purpose, nnd they were met at nearly every point with the remark that a man had been there a few days before and purchased all they had. Chicago and other .Western points have also bsen factors in the market, and laige quantities, of the article have been shipped westward. The result or all this has been the doubling ot the prices per barrel that ruled less than a mntitn ago. Good berries tb tt brought $5 or $5 50a barrel then now sell at $10 and $11, and are scarc-o even at that rate. 0HE WAY FOB FBEE 6ILVEB. Senator Vance Proposes a New Plan Based on Reciprocity. Washisotoit, Dec. 5 Special. A poll of the United States Senate to-day shows that nearly all tbe Senators expect little if auy practical good to come irom the Brussels monetary conference. In fact many of them regard the conference as a foieign Held for the ventilation of lid-cat views. It remains for Senator Vance, of North Car olina, to give the most novel, original and un'que solution of the great silver problem yet offered. His plan is almost as clever as Mr. Blaine's reclpioclty scheme, and follows the same lines, bald the North Carolina Senator to-night: "1 would secuie the co-operation of the nations by barter and sale. In other words, I would pay them for their assistance in equalizing the value of gold and silver by sharp trade discriminations. In this way EiiL-land, Austria and Germany would be soon whipped into line. Theso trade rela tions could bo secured by treaties with re ciprocity clauses. In this way the absolute free coinage of silver would bo brought about. The plan Is simple and leasl'ilp, and would meet with popular approbation." DEATHS HERB AM) tLiEWHEEE. Captain E. H. Virgil. Captain E. H. Virgil, who established the National Fxpress, died Sunday morning at Ills home In Troy, N. Y. He was born at Egremont, Mass.. In 1338. He drove coaches on the Central New York routes and throughout the Hudson Val ley In boyhood, aud in 1S41 established an express route between Albany and Montreal. A few years later tbe route was extended to Include New York. Mr. Virgil became a member of the arm of Pollen. Virgil & Co. In 1850, and three rears later a half interest in the business was bought by others, nnd the National Kxpress Company was organized.

A distinctively fashionable event was the 186th reception of the Art Socioty in tho Pittsburg Club Theater last evening. The pretty hall was filled with the most dis tinguished audience that has gathered In this city for some time. Not only was every seat occupied, but a knot of gentlemen wero compelled to stand in the ante-room to get as much of the sweet tones of the speaker of the evening as they could. The speaker was Mrs. Edmund Russell, who was deliver ing her lectnre on "Tho Art of Speech.' Standing calmly in the center or the stage, or dropping upon a sofa, as tho fancy prompted her, Mrs. Kusiell presented tho graceful figure with which many Pittsburg ers are familiar, nnd it was the whispered comment that a more easy, self-possessed, and hnndsome,woman has seldom been seen in public in this city. Mrs. Russell wore ono ot her characteristic robes of flowing dra pery, that suggested no fastenings, but ap peared to be held in place Only by tho cun ningly devised draping oj tho ma terial. It was of a pinkish hue, shot with some darker sbado, that gave forth glancing lights and shadows at every movement of tlm 'wearer. The pn port of the lecture Is Indicated in the syllabus, that wa-placed in tho hand of each orthe guests, and that read thus: First Expression in sound. Meanings or sounds. Second Bow to increase (orce or precision in speech. Third Treatment of vowels in, relation to expression. The importance of having knowledge of their formation and use in order to produce pure intonation in speak ing or singing. Effect of the provincial use or the different sounds or tuo vowel A in English. Fonrtb How tho laws orgrowth of language determine whether a gircn pro nunciation is a fashion, an affectation, or tho coming speech. Fifth Causes and cures of "Provincial Speech." How to tell whether the Paiisian, tho London, or the Western it is correct English. Sixth Iieatment or consonants as an exprc-ision or character or mood. Kesonanco to be acquired through the normal use of the nasal consonants nnd the liquid L. Dramatic effect of certain kinds of K'n, Ts and P's. boventb Special advantages or Enslish over othor languages for purposes ot oratory or song, contrasted with the special beauties of Italian. Following her custom, Mrs. Russell did not tell an, thing particularly new, bnt she of fered old truths in a charming manner that made them seem novel. It was noticeable that thero wero many musicians and vocal teachers In the hall who listened Intently to tho remarks of the lecturer, and then smiled as they recognized some fact that tliey had been leaching i or curs given to tbem In suoh manner that thoy di not, for tuo moment, appreciate their acquaintanco with it. It is to be presumed that Mis. Uub sell knows tho peculiar effect she produces, ana that she enjoys it. One of the most startling things nhe said was that the lesson iiupres-sod upon us in childhood, that it is proper to throw the shoulders back, is based on lalse preuilsesand that this particular carriage has an injurious effect upon the organs of speech. Sue Illustrated in her own person how one should walk, and it could not be denied that it was more graceful than tlm ttralnoil attitude she showed as the re sult of "throwing tho shoulders well hack," according to the old-iashioncd rule. In fact, her whole lecture was lull of amusing and pleasing little episodes or this kind. At the conclusion of her address Mrs. Russell met a large number of the ladios and gentlemen who nad listened to her lecture, nnd showed herself aj delightful a conversationalist as shu is allowed to be a lecturer.
