'** * ' ■— ST. PAUL, TUESDAY. DEC. 6, 1881. Judge Spier, of New York, has at last succumbed to the inevitable and stepped down and out of his position as Judge of the Superior court, and Judge O'Gonnan, the man elected by the Democracy of New York has assumed the duties of the position. ______ _____ There is a speck of war in the South ern skies, which comes a little nearer our doors than the Chilian imbroglioT Mexico and Guatemala are haviug a misunder standing about something, and the threat of Mexico to invade Guatemala is met by a full chorus from the states of Central America, "Come on MacDufE," etc. Tm meeting ef Congress yesterday developed nothing of remarkable inter est. The Republicans in the House elected their caucus nominees with out difficulty. The Senate was a little agitated over a reso lution of Senator Pugh for an equal division of the committees, and a Repub lican caucus resolved it should not be. The President has succeeded in conceal ing his message, and it will not be dcliv. ered until this afternoon. 

DAVID DAVIS' .HKSS OF POTTAGE. Senator David Davis, having "been called as a witness in the Guiteau trial, testified that, in his opinion, the dissolu tion of the Democracy must necessarily precede the death of the Republican par ty. The Senator was not asked — nor did he give— a reason for the faith that was in him. It is but charitable, however, to presume that the impropriety of dwarfing the case of the assassin with the details of his own treachery was as plain as the fact that his own treason had been made possible by the train of circumstances at tending the nssasaln&lkra, and that he had profited by loiu. His great effort in ad vocacy of the doctrine that the office should seek the man, and in be half of conciliation and puri fying the <"' r -:'- service of the government, was yet fresu !n the memory of the American people when the bullet of the assassin gave him an opportunity to remove the visor of inciepcrcieiice and reform, and step forth with the sign, "Barkis is willin," chalked across his back in such glaring characters as to pre clude the possibility of any political Peg gotty mistaking the bent of his mind. The elevation of the Vice- President to the Presidency and Senator Bayard to the position of President of the Senate, were events which passed in rapid suc cessson. Spurned from the Republican temple, as Bacon was from the royal presence, this pseudo-reformer, pros trated himself before his purchasers, as the great philosopher did before Buck ingham, in order that thrift might follow fawning. The prophecy, however, of the late In dependent party touching the future of the Democratic and Republican parties is, to say the least, suggestive of past folly and the necessity of avoiding in the fu ture euch a policy as made possible the elevation of a demagogue like Davis to a position of public trust. That he should be of the opinion he delivered under the solemn obligations of an oath, is fully warranted by the facts in the case. Noth ing is plainer than that the Democratic party will never go into power if it con tinues the policy of putting Republicans into position who have been expelled from their own party. The ranks and honors of the party are open to all who come with the view of placing the Demo cratic celors on the dome of the national capitol. A man like Davis, without a creed or flag, should always be distrusted. Having served under every flag, and in turn betrayed them all, let him like Judas Iscariot step one side and hang himself. THE A\K W SO VTH. The sunny South is gradually, but steadily rising from the devastation and deselation of the civil war. A new era is opened before her. The old regime of master and slave lias passed away. New industries, new enterprises, new hopes, are showing forth their enterprising faces. The cotton exposition at Atlanta, was not only of great interest, but in the highest degree instructive. It developed material and pratical interests, and how to grasp them, as never before. Northern capitalists and Southern producers of the great staple, joined in the discussion and investigation of plans, purposes and theories, with a view of reaching practi cal results. The wise conclu* ; on reached was, that the key-stor.e of southern prosperity, the very foundation rock ou which to base the superstructure of the healthful, busi ngs, up-building of the flourishing New South, is the employment of capital for the establishment of maufacturing in dustries. Why should not the cotton produced at the South be manu factured at the South? A fre quent question, and one that thrills and sends new blood pulsing through the veins and arteries of the South. Northern capital is needed. The hith erto wide distance between Northern capitalists and Southern producers is be ing bridged over. The past, with all its lsald theories and disastrous results is being bidden to stand away, while the present with its vast and quickening interests, and the future with its untold possibilities are seized upon with the grasp of accomplishment. Let the North and the South more and more fraternize, for in fraterni ty there is confidence, co-operation and unity of purpose, and a utilizing of com bined influences ©f immeasurable value. We have alluded to the Cotton exposi tion. Itajnfluence surpasses all previous thought or expectation. It is not too much to expect it to open a new line, and to be the very starting point for a new de parture for the New South, opening a career of prosperity whose rapid strides towards wealth and vast accumulations will put the Old South, with all its fan cied power, greatness and prosperity, into deep shadow. • In the editorial correspondence of the philosophical Times, bearing a recent At lantic date, w« findjnuch in the state ments given to encourage the expectation of the opening of a near-by brilliant ■ day for the new South. Says this correspond ent: Georgia has the ablest journals, the ablest statesmen, the ablest business men of any state in the South, and her people have been the earliest to learn that their destiny is in their own hands, with boundless possibilities. Her great men of war times are, as a rule, among the most liberal and progressive lead ers of the Thole South. Her Stephens, Gor dons, Browns, Hills, Colquitts, Spears and others, who shared the sad fortune of their section, were among the first to break the old Bourbon shell that confined them to the fret ful past; and the new Atlanta is their work and their pride as much as was Rome the pride of her Caesars when all roads led to the capital. ' And he adds, in regard to the softened feeling produced by peisonal contact as follows: Even the South is amazed at the complete ness of the Exposition, and the i North is equally amazed at the success of the New South in learning what Northern people had to learn to enable them to live. Sectional prejudices perish as the Northerner and the Southerner go hand in hand to enjoy the beautiful panorama of Southern advancement. THE 

BOSTON IDEAL!). A memorable Event In the History of Mu sical Entertainments in St. Paul. Anticipation is seldom met with so full a measure of realization as was the case last night when the Boston Ideal English Opera company made its debut in St. Paul. Much was expected and more was acceded. The au dience was a representative St. Paul audience —composed of people of taste and culture, and those whose reading, if not their experi ence, had taught them what is good and what is bad in the art of music. These same people crowded the Opera house last week, and were apathetic before the worm charms of the passe pritna donna, the ancient tenor, the monotonous contralto, and the mediocre pi anist, and accorded merited praise to the fine baritone and the excellent violinist. To use a vulgarism they quickly sized down Kellogg and her party, and now, regret the two bright dollars they squandered - for admission, while a five dollar note would not have been begrudged if the Ideals could have been their choice. But comparisons are odious. | Let us talk of something pleasant. We commenced well, but switched off to pen the expressions heard from the critics that passed out of the Opera house last evening. The performance of "Fatinitza," a bright, sparkling French opera, which, of course, was not, and could not, be performed in all its native broadness and suggestiveness by Boston ideals of propriety, was, as given last even ing, one of the smoothest, most finished and most satisfactory ever given in St. Paul. In fact it is impossible to remember any operatic rendition which equaled it in ensemble, and perfection. Every detail in the rendition was satisfactory, and the immense congregation of listeners were moved as a unit in acknowledg ing the success. I Space will not permit of a critical analysis of the opera and the artists. Of the opera, suffice it to say that anglicized it is beautiful and attractive to a cultivated American audi ence, abouiding in delicious gems of melody, and delightful gushes of harmony. Of course Miss Addie Phillips, (that's old style and must be pardoned for the sake of old times,) was both the hero and the heroine of the opgra. She was marvelously fine. Her acting was perfect, and even in the most fem inine scenes she never for a moment forgot the martial bearing of male character. . Her sing ing was as usual finished and satisfying, those rich resonant tones for -which she has so long been famed, lackine never a whit of their old magic. But hold, Miss Marie Stone was also a hero ine. Well there were two heroines and one hero in the persons of two lady artists. Miss Phillips played double. It seems impossible that Miss Stone could have ever been in finer voice than last evening. She did exquisite >york, her liquid tones seeming softer and sweeter than ever before. ! She had several quite intricate arias, and she displayed a dis tinctness and evenness of execution most en trancing. Mr. Whitney was truly superb in the char acter of Count Timofey, his broad, deep voice resounding with magnificent effect. He is indeed the basso profunJo par excellence of the American stage, while his action was judicious and well conceived. We all know that Tom Carl can sing, and that he is a tenor of the highest decree of at tainment. He did himself full justice lasi evening, and showed fre.sh and perhaps ii! expected power* as an actor- Jutt here il is impossible to refrain from noting the ex quisite harmony which this quartette of sing ers tendered at tt-e end of the first act. It war entitled to the raplnrnu* recall it attained. Good Harry Barnatx*, is the funniest man that ever hid a spleiMTd voice attached to a natural comedy spirit; and a fine ■ or-i.n *<• fortify it, that, ever ma 5 nt. : ii'H"-' the srnnin> dignity of a true musician. If Harry had not had the real old Boston innate manhood in him be would long ago have been spoiled on the minstrel or variety stage, although he might have, and could now hold an emminent posi tion as a comedian on the dramatic stage. Well, he was too funny in the character of Izzet Pasha an"* he sings about as well as he did "when we were boys." But are they all stars? We'll stop with George Frothingham at any rate. While this gentleman had little singing to do, he showed a true genius as a character actor, enacting the Dutchman, Steipann, with rare excellence. It was easy to discover that he can — and sing well. The chorus was exceptionally good, and an unusual opportunity was afforded of judging of it, as in the harem scene many of the young ladies had opportunities of displaying their voices, and they were, without exception, melodious and true, while in the male cho ruses the voices were found to be remarkably well-balanced and pure. A thorough training was evident throughout, both in the chorus and the orchestra, showing the guidance of a master musician. The costuming was superb, and finally all was as it should be, and hence the satisfaction. On account of some special arrangements with the principals it is found impossible to givc'*The Bells of Corneville" to morrow after noon, and the management feels that the pub lic will not be disappointed at the substitu tion of ''The Pirates of Penzance," which is comparatively n"w to St. Paul, and which will be given in elegant style by this fine com pany. ;';■'■ Following is the cast for "La Mascot," which is to be given to night, atd it will be an event, as it will introduce two artists of ex ceptional excellence, Miss Geraldine Ulmar and Mr. W.

Personal and Local News — Increased Earnings of the Omaha Llue— Ruinorea Change of Location of the Minneapolis Union Depot— Through Freight Cars- Personals, Etc. General Passenger Agent Teasdaleof the C, St. P. & O. line, has gone to Chi cago to return to-morrow. It is rumored in railroad circles here that a material change in the location of the proposed union depot of Minneapolis is impending. Isaac P. Baker, Esq. ef Bismarck, gen eral agent of the Baker line of Upper j Missouri steamers, visited the Northern Pacific offices in St. Pajil yesterday. In the general passenger office yester day all hands were found busy in prepar ing the annual exchange lists, which give the names of officers and traveling agents to be recognized in the annual swapping of passes. Frank B. Clarke, general traffic mana ger of the C, St. P. &O. line has net been tendered the position of general superintendent of the M. & St. P. r«ad. The report to that effect was only a Chi cago yarn. Commodore Eittson, having changed the name of his stock breeding farm, the old driving park to Midway,it is now pro posed to adopt the name of Kittsondale for the union stock yards and transfer station, heretorore called Minnesota Transfer. General Freight Agent Hannafordof the Northern Pacific was advised by tele graph yesterday that White's train of eight double-deck cars of sheep left Glen dive at 5:20 p. m., Sunday, billed to Min nesota Transfer and to be sent to Chica go by the C, St. P. & O. The excursion to Rock Island of cus tomers of Buford & Co., under charge of Joseph Burwell, manager for Buford & Co., in this city, will leave here Wednes day by the early morning train over Brown's "River Bank" route. The ex cursionists are to visit the plow works at Rock Island and will have a good time. The St. Paul & Manitoba railway com pany, according to calculations just com pleted in its land department, on thejlst of July last, including its indemnity lands and the lands in the limits contest ed by the Northern Pacific company, had 2,114,400 acres ot unsold lands — or enough to make 13,215 farms of 160 acres each. The Minneapolis & Louis railway with its connecting lines has arranged for through freight, without delays or trans fers between St. Paul or Minneapolis and Chicago or St. Louis. The cars will be run over the M. & St, L., C, R. I. & P. and C, B. & Q. roads, and the service is claimed to be surrounded with all the guards and checks of a well regulated fast freight line. The daily report of earnings of the C. , St. P. & O. railroad show a large increase over the corresponding days of last year. The earnings of Saturday last were, for instance, $7,000 more than the earnings of the first Saturday in December of last year. This increase is in part attributed to the more favorable weather, as com pared with last season, but is largely due to improved roadway and increased equip ment. CONFIDENCE BETRAYED. William Potter. His Confidential Clerk, Robs His Safe and Lights Oat— The Thief Apprehended at Farlbanlt. Charley Caldwell, the well known saloon and restaurant proprietor, is a victim of mis placed confidence. In his employ for six months past, as con fidential clerk and assistant general manager, has been a young man named William Potter. Potter is an exceedingly demure looking fel low, one of the goody goody sort, who g-> about with a look of ii jured innocence on their lares, and Caldwell placed the utmost confidence in him. From the confidential re lations enjoyed Potter had equal access to the *dfe with Caldwell, the combination being known only to the two. Yesterday mornine when Mr. Caldwell went to his place of busiress, about 10 o'clock, rbe "Three Golden Gats," Jackson street, Mr. Potter was not about, and had not been =een by any of the employes of the establish ment since about 5 a. m., Mr. Caldwell thought nothing of the absence of Potter until he went to the safe to get some money, when he discovered that the money drawer and contents were missing. His visit to Potter's room followed, resulting in the discovery of evidence that left no doubt Potter had levanted. The police were promptly notified and Chief Weber immediately sent telegrams out in all directions, giving a des cription of Potter and requesting his arrest and detection if seen. A little after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon he received a telegram from the chief of police of Faribault announcing Potter's arrest, in response to which Chief Weber left for that point by the 4 o'clock train to receive the prisoner, with whom, it is expected, he will return to St. Paul this morning. Mr. Caldwell is in the habit of keeping con siderable money in his safe, and he estimates that Potter got away with fully $450. Harness Thieves Arreated. Officer Merphy got his clutches on a couple of thieves named John Riley and Pat Dorsey, about 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The two worthies had just gone through Griggs & Co.'s. barn, cor ner of Eighth and Cooper streets, for a double harness, which they were lugging away when the officer spied them. See ing that they were discovered, Riley and Dorsey started to run, but the officer soon overhauled Riley and took him into cus tody, recovering the harness. Later he found Dorsey in bed at the Warren house, and placed him in the lock-up to keep company with Riley. Yesterday morning the twain were arraigned in the municipal court, but succeeded in getting the hearing postoned to Thursday morn ing. Municipal Court.

The matter was kept very quiet in order to give the police a chance to capture the perpetrato s. The machine was made of zinc and is in the police station. It is a very complete piece of mechanism. The Ninth Massachusetts. Boston, Dec. 4.— lt Is found very difficult to fix any responsibility for the grave offense alleged to have been committed in Richmond by the Ninth regiment. No case is found yet in which the perpetration of an insult to women has either confessed or had it proven against him. Since the return of the investigating com mission from Richmond, letters have been re ceived from that city which discredit the swam word of some witnesses against the regiment. Killed His Mistress. Nkw York, Dec. 4.— Thomas McDonald, a dissolute ruffian, was arrested tdfcay on the charge that he had so brutally beaten his par amour, Hattie Howard, that she died of her injuries. It seemß that early this morning McDonald went home and found his mistress asleep in a rocking chair. He awakened her by a blow with his fist, which knocked her out of the chair. He afterward struck her in the face, breast and abdomen. She fell back insensible. He then took her in his arms and carried her to a room up stairs, where the woman soon died. McDonqU was preparing for flight when arrested. Dr. Kogers Vegetable Worm Syrup instant ly destroys worms and removes the secretions which cauM them. I A.RT GOSSIP. A Talk About Pictures ihe Way They Bell and the Knowledge People Have of 7 hem. We find in the Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Union and Leader the following interest ing chat with B. W. Scott, the well known auctioneer of Philadelphia: Th c other day, while Art Auctioneer Scott was here, a Union Leader reporter had a long talk with the distinguished connois seur. It was all about paintings and painters with little bits of the eventful incidents that had|occured in the long ex perience of the gentleman who had sold paintings in almost every large city in the United Btates in his day. Scott's reccollections go way back to the days before the war, when the aristocratic Southern gentleman lived like a king upon his broad plantation and surround ed himself with every luxury that wealth could purchase. "Ah," said Scott grow ing enthusiastic as he recalled those hal cyon times, "Ah, there was real pleas ure in going down south in those days. And what made my pilgrimages more pleasant was the fact that not only did I find liberal purchases there, but a ripe knowledge of true art. Now I am a dealer in paintings and have handled some of the best productions in the world in my time But I tell you I've been heartsick, on many occasions when I've dropped into communities where they could'nt tell a true gem from a pot-boiler." "What do you call a pot-boiler?" in quired the reporter. "Why they are a cheap painting dashed with bright colors and furnished by deal ers in New York, frames and oil for $100 a dozen." "Does any one buy such things?" "Does any one buy them? Well I should say so. Why, my dear fellow, there was a time when fully two-thirds of the auction pictures were pot-boilers. You see they show up nicely under strong lights. Sometimes they are copies of genuine artists and are drawn and colored very prettily. These are done by art stu dents who get two or thme dollars apiece for painting them. They are done at odd hours and serve to keep the student in pocket money. Agents for the com panies who furnish the paintings to deal ers by the dozen, engage the nascent ar tists for the work. Oh, yes; there's many a pot-boiler hung up in the parlors of the shoddyites throughout the land." "Paid for at big prices I presume," re marked the reporter. "I saw a man in a Pennsylvania town one time, pay $410 for a painting that didn't cost the dealer more than eight dollars and a half. It was a pretty clever thing in the way of a pot-boiler and the sharpers who had opened up a sale had struck the oil in the midst of a big oil ex citement when almost everybody had plenty of money. There were no educat ed tastes at the sale. These fellows used to carry wares all over. They have been sold in the city of Wilkes-Barre in days agone, but only to persons who could be very easily deceived." "Is the business still going on?" "Oh, yes to some extent, but n»t here in the East any more. The pot-boiler, like a good many other Yankee products, has turned its face to the west and you find it now claiming the attention of the uncouth and inelegant denizens of the silver regions. It doesn't pay to put them on sale any more in these parts. The people's tastes are becoming too highly educated to insure any profitable appreciation of the pot boiler. There has been brought about to a very large extent I believe, ,by the art that furnishes us with the charming chro mos we meet everywhere." "What was the biggest bid you ever received for a painting?" "Thirty-five thousand dollars for a small Messonier, and I sold it for that. It went to a Philadelphia connoisseur." "You said the Southerners were clever buyers." "Oh indeed, they were and arestill, for that matter. But they haven't now got the money to spend for luxuries they had in the long ago. Why, I used to take a large and choice collection into some one of the southern cities in the olden days and they would be sold in two or three evenings. Every one of them. I took anly the very best artists South, as there was no sale for others. By the way, would you like to hear a little romantic incident that wove itself subsequently about a pictnre I sold once in Natchez?" "Let's have it," "Well, it was by one of our best Amer ican artists. It was a female head and it was down on the catalogue as 'A Por trait.' It was a beauty, I tell you. Not only as a work of art, but as a counter part of one of the lovliest faces I ever be held. "There was a lively competition for the picture at the sale and it was finally knocked down to a rich young planter. At the close of the sale I met the hand seme young purchaser of the portrait, and I said to him 'you've got a charming thing in that picture.' 'I know it,' he said, 'and I'm going to start out to-mor row and find the original.' I thought he was joking and paid no more attention to it. Just seven years later I happened to be in Natchez again. During the af ternoon of the first day of my arrival I was accosted on the street by a gentleman with, "Mr. Scott do you know me?' I glanced up and met a pair of eyes that seemed familiar. I hesitated. 'Well, I'm the gentleman that bought that portrait of you when you were here last.' I recognized him then. 'Will you do me the pleasure of dining with me at 5. There's my address. 1 shall expect you surely,' and he walked away. I went to his house and I was in troduced to the original of that portrait. I got from him the story of his search for her, after tea when we were alone. She was a poor girl residing in New York who had been induced to sit for the pic ture. He found her through the aid of the artist who painted her picture. He made her rich and happy." "Quite a romance, Scott." "Yes, and a romance of real life, as the novelists say." NEWPORT. Newport, Dec, 4- — There seems to be some kind of disease going through this vicinity of late, which proves very fatal, and which our physician hesitates, your representative is informed, to name. 'Last Tuesday Mr. David Wentworth lost a little child one and a half years old with this composition disease. A very sudden death with the same, of a woman, is re ported, on Grey Cloud Island, and Miss Sallie Wood is lying in a low condition, but is in a fair way to recovery. Owing to so much wet weather this fall, is is possible that this poisonous infestation has been deposited and retained in our cellars. Candidate for th« LTncher§, - ViCK«BURG,Dec. 4.— J. D.

The Canadian governor general, the marquis of Lome, now in England, will not return to Canada, it is said, unless his wifa, the Princess Louise, accompanies him. Mrs. Garfield receives from thirty to sixty letters a day from impecunious fools, from all parts of the country, begging for money; including some "weak" churches. Recently four negroes in the Oxford, N. C, charged with murder were taken out by a mob of masked men, numbering about one hun dred, and hung. The negroes, it is said, male full confession of their crime. Ihe creditors of the Rhode Island Sprague estate, discouraged by the long delayed settle ment and clouded prospects for the future, are offering to take fifty cents on the dollar. A compromise on this basis seems probable. It is said of the "busted" Pacific bank of Boston that it is believed more hardship and loss will be entailed by forcing it into the hands of a receiver than by letting its friends reorganize it, which they are able and willing to do. A meeting was recently held in London by the principal Jewish associations of Great Britain to consider how best to relieve the Russian Jews from their perilous condition, and the dreadful fate that seems to threaten them. Guiteau says he will take the lecture field and make $50,000 next year. He did not former ly draw as a lecturer, but he thinks he will "draw" better now. The question is, will Hades afford a good field for a lecturer of his calibre. A reverend divine of New Brunswick, (a province of the dominion) says, the assassina tion of Garfield was ordered by God as a pun ismentof the nation, because of the popular and semi-official reception of Parnell in this country. Leavenworth, Kansas, had a big scare the other night, caused by a rumor that the James boys with several men were about to make a descent upon that city. The reported marauders failed, however, to put in an ap pearance. The New Orleans Democrat stoutly avers that there are not three greater imposters on the theatrical road than Lawrence Barrett, Emma Abbott and Mary Anderson. Upon what meat has this journal fed that it is thus maggot} f Mrs. Garfield has been elected the first hon orary member of the New Shakespeare society of London, "as a slight tribute of admira tion for the loving devotion shown by her during the long and painful illness of the late President." President McCosh, of Princeton college. New Jersey, says there is a decrease in the number of college graduates who go into the ministry, and Rev. Lyman Abbott, editor of the Christian Union, adds, there is a decrease in quality as well as in quantity. Mrs. Belle Spaulding, of Galesburg, LI., having been acquitted of the murder of her tiusband, celebrated her escape by giving a banquet to the jury. Eighfeaf them accepted the invitation. The other four did not. They received tickets to a minstrel show that night. A movement is said to be on foot to run Attorney General MacVeagh for g vernor of Pennsylvania. The New York Herald says he will take the nomination "as the leader of the reform, independent, high-minded, Christian, Republican party, opposed to all machines and all bosses." The Republican sachems of MaiDe have had a meeting at Portland. Senator Frye was ap pointed chairman of the "ring" state commit tee, in place of Secretary Blame, resigned. For the next Republican governor, as the choice of Mr. Blame, the sachems selected William Widgery Thomas, Jr. 41 Phoebus what a name To swell the sounding trump f future fame. Mrs. Garfield has forwarded the photograph of the late president requested by Queen Vic toria. The photograph was enclosed in an envelope bordered with mourning, addressed to Queen Victoria, with the name of Mrs. Garfield written on the lower comer. It was encased in a box lined with dark blue satin velvet, which was again encased in a mahog any box, and was transmitted by the depart ment of state through the regular official channels. There is little hope for a Republican form of government in Rhode Island, but the oligar chy which rules that state is making a little progress in the right direction. It is actually considering the proposition to allow honorably discharged union soldiers to vote at elections, even if they do not own real estate. The time may yet come when a well behared and intelli gent foreign-born citizen of Rhode Island will have the rights and privileges enjoyed by a rascally and ignorant native-born one. A traveler bought an excursion ticket from Washington to Toledo, and, owing to deten tion of trains, for which he was not responsi ble, its limit of time expired while he was stil on the way, The conductor on the terminal road demanded regular fare, and put him off the train when he refused to pay. He sued the company whose agent sold him the ticket, on the ground that the contract was made with that official for the entire journey, and the jury, on the direction of the court, gave him a verdict of $500. John Hay, of Cleveland, has been loftily airing his classical attainments in the New York Tribune, by re-translating the Latin phrase written by President Oarfleld on his death bed. Mr. Hay thinks "slaughtered" is not the proper translation of "strangulatus," and thinks the president meant "tortured for the republic" when he wrote "strangulatus pro republica." Yet, the result proved that he was* slaughtered for the republic, though "tor tured" by the act; the sensitive reOnement of the asthetic Mr. Hay, to the contrary, not withstanding. There is much comment and no little feeling prodnctd by the failure of the star route eases in Washington. Somebody is responsible for the failure of the prosecution of the plun derers. The attempt to make MacVeagh the scapegoat in this miserable business may for a time be apparently successful, but it will fail in the end. He is at present pursued by the friends of President Arthur with a malignity and a ferocity inexplicable, except on the the ory that they are endeavoring to shield the lukewarmness of the president in the star route prosecutions. Frank E. Marvin, of Chicago, was infatu ated with the widow Do wling, in whose board ing house he lived; but she cared nothing for him except as a promptly-paying boarder, and therefore kept him in suspense as to her real sentiments. "I am tired of waiting for your answer," he said the other day at the dinner table. "Say you will marry me, or I'll swal low this poison with my coffee;' 1 and he tooK the drug from his pocket. The widow laugh ed at him, thinking it was a joke. "Once for all,*' he solemly protested, "say yes, or I'll die right here"." She said no, and he was dead in an hour.

A fine musical and literary ■ programme has been prepared, and will be presented to their guests. During the fire on Sunday morning, Nick Steffes, foreman of Hose company No. 4. was hurled by the explosion from a shed, on which he was standing, to the platform below, a distance of nearly twenty-five feet. He es caped, comparatively, uninjured. "■ . * v' 1 -?;.. A man was , captured by a night watchman last evening, for stealing a sack of flour from ! a freight car in the Milwaukee railway yard. The man freely admits the theft, but urges in excuse that his family had nothing to eat and were hungry. ' .*r;' ; i A little girl was quite severely bitten in the hand by an ugly dog on the street, at the cor ner of Washington avenue and Third avenue south, yesterday. The peanut vender at the place dispatched the brute with a shot from his revolver. The little girl was taken at once to a surgeon and the wounds properly cared for. The uncle of the unfortunate Emma Peter son, who was beheaded by a train of cars on Nicollet island, writes to Coroner Fairbairn: "Let the authorities bury her." This sounds harsh indeed, coming as it does from a blood relation (the only one in America) who is well endowed with worldly possessions. The poor, unfortunate girl will be buried a pauper. After the Disaster. Large crowds of people visited the milling district yesterday to view the scene of the sad disaster. The smouldering ruins looked black and foreboding. A large crew of work men were busily engaged in removing the heavy timber and debris in the hope of recov ering the remains of poor John Tuhey, but up to last night were unsuccessful. The report published in yesterday's Globe was substantially correct and gave the esti mates of losses, insurance, etc., which yester day's developments failed to alter materially. During the morning Gates, the fireman, supposed to have been buried in the ruins at the time of the explosion of the Minneapolis mill, reported for duty. This leaves the death roll at four. The insurance adjusters are expected to arrive to-day and begin at once to fix values, losses, etc. No trouble is antici pated by the mill men. The property, as soon as the insurance has been adjusted, will be cleared up and construc tion work begun. Larger and better mills will take the place of those destroyed in the con flagration. The very best machinery will be used. The Postoffice Removal Question. A dispatch was received yesterday by the agents of the new Boston block being erected hy Messrs. Whitten, Burdette A Young, of Boston, which states that a lease has been drafted, signed and deterred, which gives con clusively a portion of the block to the govern ment for postoffice use. In exchange for the same a lease has been given to Messrs. Whit ten, Burdette A Young, of the city hall build ing. It also stated that the company pro posed to take possession of the latter building as soon as the Boston block is ready for occu pancy by the postal services. This ends the complicated matter, The pestoffice must go— let the city hall ring kick as vigorously as a young government mule. A Dastardly Wretch, The above headline refers to one W. J. Hamilton. At the corner of Third street and Third avenue south, the disgusting beast was making an indecent exposure of his person in the presence of a number of ladies who were passing along the street, when Joseph Rainger npbraided him for the outrage. Hamilton turned upon him and dealt him a heavy fist blow in the face. Officer Hannigan made an opportune appearance, and, after a sharp strug gle, succeeded in placing the scoundrel under arrest.

Stocks — Ttie stock market was strong at the opening and prices generally %@l% per cent, higher, Me aphis & Charleston, Boston Air Line preferred and Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis shiwing the greatest improvement. There was good buying in the early dealings and prices advanced steadily until an improve ment of %t o 3* per cent, took place, Rich mond & Danville, Boston Air Line preferred, Philadelphia A Reading, Denver A Rio Grande and Missoui i Pacific being most prominent therein. Diring the afternoon speculation became feverish and gradually assumed a weak tone, prices falling off steadily to the close and the final Bales being generally at a decline ot k @2* per cent, from the highest point of the day. The shares most conspicu ous in the downward movement were Rich mond & Danville, Wabash, St. Louis A Pa cific, Bostot Air Line preferred, Denver A Rio Grande and Chicago A Northwestern. Until a money sti ingency was developed all Stock Exchange n arkets were strong, but when a commission had to be paid for money the stock market began to be heavy, and the fail ure of the C hicago & Northwestern directors to increase their dividend, as it had been re-, ported they would do, added to the general depression aad in the last hour the stock mar ket was weak and the early advance was gen erally lost, to that a good part of the list closed lowei than Saturday. Several special ties closed a tan advance. No important news has been received 'from Washington, neither the president's message nor the treasury re port having been known here before the close of business. When the stock market was strong Philadelphia & Reading was the fea ture and advanced to 71* , although closing at 69* . It was reported that an offer of $40 per share hs d been bid the McCalmonts for their stock i a said company, but this could not be confirmed. To-day Jay Gould, Russell Sage, Cyrus W.
