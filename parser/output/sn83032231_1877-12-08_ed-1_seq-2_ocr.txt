II. V. MORTHIWKIt, KDITOR LKIIiailTON, PA.: (SATURDAY MOKN1NO, DKORMBKH 8, IB7T. The number of failures In Kovcmbernt New York wore about tho same as in Octo Ixr, but the amount of liabilities about two million dollars, aro fortunately only one half a much. Tho War Department has Issued orders for the departure of a number of troops in fantry, cavalry and artillery to tho Rio Grande, tt Is stated that these troops are sent to the border solely for the protection of tho settlers on the frontier, and not because of any new complications with Mexico. The estimates of tho Secretary of the Treasury for the expenses of tho Government for tho fiscal year ending June 30th, 1ST!), aggregate $280,888,796. The estimates for tho current fiscal year were $299,011,071,but the amount appropriated by Congress was $220,968,070, or $72,043,601 less than the estimates. At TitUburg, on Saturday of Inst week, the following July rioters were sentenced : Daniel Moran and Alexander McAllister, for malicious mischief, each pay a fine of $500 and be imprisoned six months in the work house j J. M. Green, for diverting a twitch, $1500 fine and 6 months in the Penitentiary. Thomas McCall, for striking Assistant Superintendent Watt, when the latter attempted to movo tho switch, 1500 fine and imprisonment for one year. James Ciarter, for making incendiary threats, $2000 fine and 22 months in tho penitentiary. Matthew Marshall, forfiringcoke cars,$5000 fine and 6 years and 10 months in the peni tentiary. The latest exposure of savings bank frauds is that of tho New Kochelle, and tho modtu operandi, as described by tho Tribune, cannot he more simple and direct in effect ing tho end aimed at. Tho secretary, it eeeras, had been systematically stealing the funds. His process consisted chiefly in put ting into his own pockets the cash that was deposited, tho only record of the deposits be iuginthepassbooks. This method of fraud, though not new in banking experience, is, nevertheless, ono of tho things that good management always guards against. Such doings cannot bo carried on for a length of time unless the trustees aro neglectful of their duties, since a comparison between tho pass books and tho ledger would at any time reveal it. Eight thousand people have signed a petition to Congress, prcsonted by tho Hon. Hendrick B. Wright, of this Stale, asking for tho enactment of a law under which tho Government should lend $500 to each indi vidual settler on tho public lends, taking a mortgage therefor on tho land, also given to the settler. The Kansas Farmer expresses i-urprise at the discovery that there aro so many "wild and visionary pcoplo" as to furnish eight thousand signatures to the pe tition. But thero is no reason for surprise. It Is better to sign a petition asking for a law, however impracticable and foolish, which is designed to help working men to obtain farms, than to enact a law which will prac tically rob working men of at least ten cents on the dollar; and there are a good many advocates of the latter kind of legislation. When a man boasts that ho " never bolted a ticket in his life," that ho never voted for a man belonging to the opposite party for an office, and declares that ho never will, other peoplo are warranted in holding him to bo a demagogue, or a knave, or a fool. But, says an exchange, Senator Patterson, who made this kind of a declara tion before tho Senate, a day or two ago, has had the misfortune to be proved a knave for other and more weighty reasons. While he is a very prominent figure In the Senato determining the rights of other men to a scat there, a committee of tho Legislature of his own State is pioclaiming him a knave, fleeted to his high office by tho grossest kind of jiersonal bribery and corruption. Thero does not seem to be any question of tho truth of the charges made against him, for they are reasonable, and supported by a great mass of testimony, largely gathered Irom his followers and adherents. If the Benate could,for a few days, rise above party spirit, or sink belqw it like Patterson, there might still bo somo uncertainty about But ler's admission, but none about Patterson's expulsion. Says a correspondent of tho Scranton Daily ltepublican, speaking of the able ser mon of Rev. Dr. Logan, of the First Presby terian Church, of that city, on Thanksgiving Day : Ir. Logan In bis able sermon on Thanksgiving day, tti uck the key note of our trouble when be Hid ' wo have good laws, bat tuey are not exe cuted." lulalsjust what we have claimed for the pa.t three 'years.

Jt'inci Tlio President's Mcssnrrp. On Monday last President Itnycs sent his first annual Message to Congress, of which tho following is a brief synopsis : the Message- opens with a full discussion of the re sults of his "discontinuance of the uso of tho army for tho purpose Of upholding local go vernment " in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina. Under tho circumstances ho deemed that course not only a constitu tional duty and requirement, but a much needed measure for tho restoration of local self government and the promotion ofnation al hnrirlony. As to the results of his action, he says t " Thero has been a general re-cs-tablishmcnt of order and of tho orderly administration of justice; Instances of re maining lawlessness hard become of raro occurrence j political turmoil and turbulcnco have disappeared; useful industries have been resumed ; public credit in the Southern States has been greatly strengthened; and the encouraging benefits of a revival of com merce between tho sections of the country lately embroiled in civil war aro fully en joyed." -Upon these results ho thinks tho country is to bo congratulated, and to this, we havo no doubt, a large majority of his fellow citizen will say Amen 1 He has no apprehensions or misgivings, his explana tion is frank and manlv. and ho has " abid ing faith that time will lurnisn nmple vin dication of his course." That part of tlio Mcssago winch uiscutses uio bouincrn ques tion is followed by an earnest oppcajlo Con gress, to the Legislatures, Executives and Courts of the States for protection iinil help in every just form to the cpfiancUised color ed people that object "is very dear to his heart." Then comes tho discussion of resumption and of the currency and finance, as related to the proposed silver dollar coinage. Tho President favors such policy and measures only as will load to tho resumption of Epocio payments, and thus place our internal trade and foreign commcrco in harmony with tho system of exchanges based upon tho pre cious metals as tho intrinsic money of tho World. The policy of resumption Euould bo fiursued by every suitable means, and no egislation is deemed wiso that discharges tho importance or that would retard the at tainment of that result. Wavering inpur ijoso of unsteadiness of methods, bo far from relicvine- cxistine trouble would only tend to increased and prolonged disturbance of values, and poosibly end in serious disorder, dishonor and disaster to both Government and people. Tho industrious masses, wheth er skilled or unskilled as to tncir occupa tions, should bo compensated in money which is in itself fixed in its exchangeable value. This is most certainly secured by a currency exchangeable in gold coin. As to tho attempt to make the 4121-grain Bilver dollar circulato as an equivalent for a gold dollar, the Message suggests the impracti- 1. ;!!' t -!..! . rl !!... . il. Ullll UI Kit ing uuiiiiui'iciui miu.iuij lu wiu two metals, in viewof tlio fluctuations in tho price of silver, iho President holds that such equality of commercial value, and a limitation of tho amount for which tlio pro posed silver dollar shall bo a legal tender, aro essential conditions for keeping such dol lars anu goiu uounra in circuiuuon ui me samo time. "Without these conditions" tho President fears "that only mischief and mis fortune would flow from the coinage of sil ver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal tender. ' Any expectation oi tempor ary relief from an issue of silver coinago to pass as a legal tender, at a rato materially above its commercial value, tho President regards as "a delusion." For several rea sons, set forth with great clearness and force, lie believes mat any legislation looking to the payment of either tho interest or princi pal of the Government bonds in the proposed silver coinage, would not only bo a breach of faith by the Government, but a serious loss in money, ns it must inevitably prevent tho progress of funding the debt at lower rates of iutcrcst. Adherence to good faith, and tho payment of interest and principal in gold, tiie only coin recognized at the time of the negotiation of the bonds, will enable the Government to effect a still further saving of $20,000,000 a year in interest, and an ag gregate of $300,000,000 before tho debt final ly matures. It is suggested to Congress that, in any legislation it adopU for tho coinage of a silver dollar,said legislation should limit its legal tender function, should equalize its commercial value with that of tho gold dol lar, and sl'ould expressly exempt tho pub lic debt and interest from payment in anv coin of less commercial value than that of the present gold coinage of tho couutry. This means that Congress need not expect the President's approval to the Bland bill in any form in which that notorious measure can bo put. "Wavering of purpose" and "unsteadiness of methods" about tho resump tion of specie payments, which means liv ing's bill, and the attempt to forco tho clip ped coin falsely called "the dollar of the fathers," nre things that aro to reeeivo no countenance from the President of tho Unit ed States. Tho next subject in order and in import ance is that relating to tho reform of the civil service, and to its enfranchisement Irom Congressional interference. In this, as well as in regard to tho currency, and Southern self-government, tho President adheres to the ibIicv announced in his letter of accept ance and in his inaugural address; and he believes that he is in accord with tho peoplo on tho subject. It is his purooso to adhere to ihe y Ian of the Constitution in tho matter, which invests the President with the power of selection finu gives to tne cenaio mo pow er to consent or reject. This ho regards ns a wise distribution of powers, and he nuietlv reminds Senators In na incidental way that they can exercise theirdlities as "disinterest ed and Impartial judges" ot the fitness of his selections, all tho better if they have no hand in nrcHunp their friends anil favorites upon him beforehand. This little touch of humor and satire is managed with rare and delicate skill. He also reminds Congress mat the uivil service Commission has still a legal existence, and is at work, although there is no appropriation to pay its expenses, and he asks for an appropriation. Our foreign relations are all in such ami cable condition that no remark upon that part of tho Message is required here, except to say mat mo rresiucni uojies me tieet irom Mexico, notwithstanding the border bother ations, and that he would like to havo some legislative he) p about the Venezuelan claims. Then follow references to the depresfion in iraue ; me acsiranmy oi extending tne lor eign markets for our products ; and the na tional finances, which are in cood condition and will be better if there isno antt-resump- vnuiuim ii-giu-ii'imersuvertiuiiuriegiKiuuou. TliA XImbm l.a inM.l. h1.a tl.ot. commends a curtoms duly of ten cents a pound on tea and two cents a iound on cof fee to increase the Treasury receipts, and to enable Congress to take off all the remaining Internal Hevenne taxes, except those on spirituous and malt liquors and tobacco, The President is a little astray about this, and had better "let well enough alone," The remaining topics of the Message are mainly routine matters relating to the De partment ItenorU (Army, Navy, Post-office, imiciiwi, vuBiiuc aim jigncuiiurcj uau vo an appeal in benair oi justice to the Indians and another appeal in behalf of that inter citing but expensivo appendage to the Gov ernment, the District of Columbia, that con sumes so much and produces so little, which has such an undue projwrtion of unproduc' tlve inhabitants, and which is, therefore, nearly always In need of largo pecuniary aid from tho Treasury of the United States. By th monthly report of the" public debt for November wo learn that the debt was decreased during tho month $1,323,034 C3. The total principal of the debt now outsandingis $2,108,528,811 28, on which there is duo and unpaid of interest $31,644, 767 18, giving a total of principal and inter est of $2,230,174,078 16. There was at tho same tlmo cash In tho Treasury, of coin, $133,980,314 43, of currency $9,806,007, cur rency held for redemption of fractional cur rency, $8,810,306 39,exclusivo of$36,055,000 of special deposits for redemption of certifi cates, making tho total of cash in tho Trea sury $188,647,615 82, less estimated amount duo military establishments for which no appropriations have been mt.de, $4,5000,000, reducing the total debt, less cash in tho Treasury on Nov. 1,1877, to $2,047,350,700 57. Debt less nmount In Treasury Dec. 1, 1877, $2,040,027,085 94, showing a decreaso during the past month of $1,323,634 03. Decrease of debt since Juno 30, 1877, $14, 131,157 32. Bonds issued to Pacific railroad corupauies,intercst payable in lawful money, principal outstanding, $04,628,512 ; interest accrued and not yet paid, $1,615,567 80; interest paid by tho United States, $35,957,- C29 14; interest repaid by transportation of mails, etc., $8,975,433 32; balanco of inter est paid by United States, $20,982,195 82, Tlio payments made from the Treasury by warrants during tho month were i On ac count of civil and miscellaneous, $,815,787 85 ; War, $7,553,239 27 ; Navy, $1,517,720 79 ; Interior (Indians and Pensions), $3, 054,170; total, $15,8-10,921 01. Tho abovo does not include payments mado on account of the interest or principal of tho public debt of the United States. There is no doubt much suffering from want of employment, though tho distress in consequenco is greatly exaggerated, as in point : Itepresentativo Ewlng, in his recent speech in Congress favoring tho repeal of tho ltesumption act, mado the assertion that the president of tho Dayton and Southeast ern Railroad had told him that hundreds of men had been offering to-work on tho road for bread and meat. Col. D. E. Mead, presi dent of tho road mentioned, authorizes the statement that men havo never yet offered to work for bread and meat, and that tho company has, in fact, much trouble in cm ploying laborers at good wages. It may further bo said that the contractors of the Springfield Jackson and Pomcroy Narrow Gauge Itoad are also needing a largo num ber of men to work on their road, and offer good wages to all who will apply for steady employment.
