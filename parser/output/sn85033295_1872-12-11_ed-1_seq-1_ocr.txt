KEITHS. VOL. XIII. NATSONAL AFFAIRS Fourth Annual Message of Presi dent Grant, Delivered to Congress at I O’clock December 2d. To the Senate and House of Representatives ; In transmitting to yon my fourth annual message, it i with thankfulness to the Giver of all Good that, as a nation, wc have been blessed for tho past year with peace at home and abroad, and a general prosperity vouch safe to hut few people. With the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept from earth in a breath, as it were, millions of accumulated wealth, in the city of Boston, there have been no over shadowing calamities vi; bin the year to re cord. It is gratifying to note how, like their fellow-citizens of the city of Chicago under similar circumstances a vear earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes, and there is a prospect that their : energy and perseverance will overcome all ; obstacles and show the same prosperity soon -Hat they would, had no disastersffallon open i them. Otherwise w- have been free from pcs- j tilence, war and calamities which often over- ' take nations, and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no cause seems to | exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

GENEVA ARBITRATION. When Congress adjourned in June last a question had been raised by Great Britain and was then pending, whch for a time seriously imperilled the settlement, hr friendly arbitra tion, of the differences existing between this Government and that of Her Britanic Majesty, that tho Treaty of Washington had referred to the Tribunal of Arbitration which had met at Geneva in Switzerland. The arbitrators, how ever, disposed of the question which had jeopardized tho whole of the treaty and threat ened to involve the two nations in the most unhappy relations toward each other in a manner entirely satisfactory to this govern ment and in accordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained. The tribunal which had convened in Geneva in December concluded its laborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross, it made its decision, whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold as tho indemnity to bo paid by Great Britain to the United States for the satisfaction of all claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long-standing difference between tho two governments, and in connec tion with another award made by the German Emperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves the Government without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is i my siucei'e hope may forever remain equally unchanged. The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Geneva tribunal, ac companid by the protocals of the proceedings | ol the arbitrators, the arguments of the coun sel of both Governments, the award of the tri bunal and tho opinions given by the several i arbitrators, is transmitted herewith. I have j caused to be communicated to the heads of the three friendly powers, who complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty, the thanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made by them respectively, and also my thanks to the eminent personages named by them, and my appreciation of tho dignity, patience, impartiality and great abil ity with which they discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majesty’s govern ment has comrannicated to me its apprecia tion. by Her Majesty, of tho ability and inde fatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, in tho arbitration named, on the part of this Gov ernment, during the protracted inquiries aud discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite with Her Majesty in this appreciation" It is duo to the agent of tho United Slates before the tribunal to record my appreciation of the marked ability, unwearied patience and the prudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible aud delicate duties committed to him, as it is also due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government to express my sense of the talent and wisdom which they brought to hear in the argument and the results so happily reached. It will be the province of Congress to provide for tfie distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respective shares ofthe money to be paid. Although the sum awarded is not payable until a year from the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in mak ing proper examination of tho several cases in which indemnification may he due. I conse quently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for the purpose. THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY QUESTION. By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and Great Britain in their con struction of the treaty of the 15th of June, 1846, defining the boundary line between their respective territories, were submitted for arbitration and award to His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, to decide winch of these claims was most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, having been pleased to assume the arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of the United States for the labor, pains aud care which he has devoted to the consideration of this long pending difference. I have caused an expression of my thanks te be cqm communicated to his Majesty. Mr. (Bancroft, the representative ot this government at Berlin, conducted the case, and pre pared the statement on tho part of tho United States with the ability that his past service justified the public iu expecting at his hands, as a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given rise to the discussion between the two governments, as the Minister to Great Britain when the construction now pronounced unfounded, was first advanced, and as the agent and repre sentative cf tho government, to present tho case and to receive the award. Ho has been associated with the question iu all ot its phases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal aud counsel in the maiutaiuance of the claim of the United States, He is en titled to much credit for the success which has attended the submission. After a patient investigation of the case, and of the statements of each party, His Majesty the Emperor ef Germany, on the twenty-first day of October last,signed his award in writing, decreeing that the claim of the government of the United States, that the boundary line be- i tween the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and the United States should be through the I Haro Channel, is most in accordance with the ’ true interpretation of the treaty concluded on the 15th of June, 1848, between tho agents of Her Britannic Majesty and ofthe United States. Copies of the case presented on behalf of each government and of the statement in re ply, of each, and a translation of the award ate transmitted herewith. This award con firms the United States in their claims to the important archipeligo of islands lying between tho continent and Van Couvers Island which for twenty-six years, ever since the ratification of the treaty. Great Brit ain has contested, and leaves ns, for the first time in the history of the United States, as a nation without a question of disputed boundary between our territory and the pos sessions of Great Britain on this content. It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt and spontaneous action of Her Majesty’s Government iu giving effect to tho award In anticipation of any request from Ibis Government, and before the reception in the United States of tho award, signed by the Emporor, If r Majesty had given instructions for the removal of'her troops which had boon stationc I tin re, and for the cessation of all exorcise or claim of jurisdiction.so as to have u.s conclusive possession of the disputed ter ritory. I am grateful to be able to announce that tho orders for the removal of the troops have been executed, and the military joint oo pation ot San Juan has ceased. The islands are now iu tho exclusive possession of tiie United States. It now becomes necessary to complete tho survey and determination of that portion ofthe boundary line through the Haro Channel, upon which the commission, which determined the remaining part of the line,were unable to agree, I reccommend t lie appoint ment of a commission to act jointly with ono I which may ho named by Her Majesty j lor that purpose. Tho experience of the ; difficulties attending the determination | of our admitted line of boundary alter the oc | cup uiou of the tonitoi y, and its'settlement by j those owing allegiance to the respective gov i crntiieuu, points to the jnipoi taric© ot eeinb- Hulling, by natural objects or oilier raonu ; meats, the actual line between tho territory i acquired by purchase from Russia, and ! the adjoining possessions of Her i Britannic Majesty. The region is I now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting j interests of individuals or of jurisdiction are j likely to interfere to the delay or embarrass ment of the actual location of the line. If cle j ferred until population shall enter and occupy | the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the Governments in antagon ism. ; I therefore recommend the appointment of ! a commission to act jointly with one that may i be appointed on tho part of Great Britain, to : determine the line between our territory of j Alaska and the coterminus possessions ot j Great Britain. THE 

FISHERIES. In ray last annual message I recommended I the legislation necessary on the part of the | United States to bring into operation the articles of the Treaty of Washington of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries, and the other I matters touching the relations of the United j States toward the British North American pos i sessions to become operative so soon as tho | proper legislation should be had on the part ' of Great Britain and her possessions. That legislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions bad not then been bad, and during the session of Congress a question was rafted which tor a time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the direc tion indicated would become important, a question wh .it lias since been disposed of, aVd I JmVe ;“-ccivt(l notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of the provincial government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty on the mat ters referred into operation, I therefore re commend your early adoption of the legisla tion in the same direction necessary on the part of this government. The Joint Commission for determining the boundary due between the United States and Jjte British possessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains lias organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be increased. In order that the completion of the survey tnd determation of the boundary line may be sooner attained. To this end, I recommend that a sufficient oppropriation be made. OCR FOREIGN RELATIONS. With France, onr earliest ally, Russia, the constant and steady friend ofithe United States. Gennany, with whose government and people wo have so many cases of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe,' onr relations are maintained n the most frieiullyterms. Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratifications of a treaty with the Austro-Hnngary Empire, relating to nat uralization ; also of a treaty with the Gorman Empire respecting consuls and trademarks; also of a treaty with Sweden and Is or wav re lating to naturalization—all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. THE INTERNATIONAL STATISTICAL CONGRESS. Congress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray the expenses of Com missioners on the part of the United States to the International Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, persons apnointed in that charac ter proceeded to their destination, and attend ed the sessions of the Congress. A report shall in due season be laid before you. This Congress meets at intervals of about three i years, and has held its sessions in several of the countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration the propriety of extending an in vitation to the Congress to hold its next meet ing in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 1876 would afford an appropriate occasion for such a meet ing. THE VIENNA INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION. Preparations are making for tho Interna tional Exhibition to be held during next year in Vienna on a scale of very great magnitude. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advenccd civilization, and the elevation of industry, of labor, and increase of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between the nations. As this Exposition is to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufactures will be ready to avaii themselves of tho opportunity for the presentation of their productions, if encouraged by proper aid and protection. At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this government at the Exposition. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of any appropriation there is danger that the impor tant benefits which the exposition offers will in a large degree be lost to tho citizens of tho United States. 1 commend the subject strong ly to vour consideration, and recommend that an adequate appropriation bo made for the purpose, to further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition. I would recommend, iu addition to an appropriation of money, that tho Secretary of the' Navy be authorized to tit up two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most conve nient port to Vienna and back, tneir articles for exhibition. MEXICO AND THE FRONTIER TROUBLES. Since your last session the President of the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his high character and by his services to his country, has died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the peo ple, a proof of confidence on rhoir part in his patriotism and wisdom, which it is believed will bo confirmed by the results of his administration. It is par ticularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the governments of either Re publics to strengthen their relations as neigh bors aud friends. It iu much to be regretted that many lawless acta continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border of our territory and that of Mexico, and that com plaints of wrong to American citizens in various parts of the country. Tho revolutionary con dition in which the neighboring Republic has so long been involved has in some degree con tributed to this disturbance. Its to he hoped that, with a more settled rale of order through out the Republic which may be expected from the present government, the acts of which just complaint is made will cease. 

MEXICAN CLAIMS. The proceedings of the commission under the convention with Mexico of the 4th of July 1868,’0n the subject of claims have unfortun ately been checked by an obstacle for the removal of which measures have been taken by the governments, which it is believed, will prove successful. INVESTIGATION OF TEXAS FRONTIER TROUBLES. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress, of the 7th of May last, to inquire into the depredations on tho Texas frontier have diligently made inves tigations in that quarter, and their report on the subject will be communicated to vou. Their researches were necessarily incompietej partly on account of the limited appropriation made by Congress. Mexico on her part has appointed a similar commission to inves tigate these outrages. It is not announced of ficially, but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I, therefore, rec ommend that a special appropriation bo made at the earliest day practicable, to enable the commissioners on tho part of the United States to return to their labors without delay. CUBAN AFFAIRS. It is with regret that I have again to an nounce a continuance of the disturbed condi tion of the Island ol Cuba, No advance to wards a pacification of the discontented por- 1 tion ot the populace has b"en made while the insurrection has gained no advantage and ex hibits no more ot the element of power or the i prospect ol ultimate success than were exhib ited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded m its repression, and the parties stand ap parently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent to the ! results, although humanity could not be un- ' moved by its incidents, wherever they might ccur however at our door. 1 cannot doubt that the continued main tenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms 1 in the administration of the government in Cuba could not fail to advance the return ot peace and order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberal government of Rpain will voluntarily adopt this view, Tho law of emancipation which was passed more than two years since has remained unexecuted. In tho absence of regulations for its enforcement, it was but a feeble step toward eman cipation, hut it was the recognition of right, and was hailed as such, and exhibit ed Spain iu harmony with the sentiments iff humanity and of justice, and in sympathy with other powers of the Christian and civil ized world. Within the past tew weeks the regulations -for carrying out the laws ot 

WATERTOWN, WIS„ WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1872. emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of intention of the nrefsent government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil which oppressed a race and continues a bloody and de structive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency and the justice of conceding reform's of which the propriety is not questioned. Deeply im pressed with the conviction that the continu ance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the continuation, of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be eilch are large holders in Cuba of what is there claimed as prop erty,; but which is forbidden and denounc ed by the laws of the United States. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continuance of (his distressing and sickening contest. In my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend such legislation ns may bo proper to denounce and if not pr; rent, at least to discourage, American cit.zc-ns from holdingor dealing in slaves. SPAIN AND THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS. It is gratifying to announce that the ratifica tion of the Convention concluded under the auspices of this government between Spain on the one part, and the allied republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armis tice, have been arranged. A copy of the in strument is herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace between (lie same ; arties. SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS. The differences which at one time threaten ed the maintenance of peace between Brazil and the Argentine Repuolic, it is hoped arc on the way to a satisfactory adjustment. With these states as with the Republics of Central at id South America, we continue to maintain the most friendly relations. It is with regret, however, I announce that the govern ment of Venezuela has made no further pay ments on account of the awards made under the convi ntion of the 25th of April, 1866. That republic is understood to be now almost, if not quite trauquilized. It is hoped, there fore, that it will lose no time in providing for the unpaid balances of "its debts to the United States, which, having originated m injuries to its citizens by the Yenezuelean autorities, and having been ac knowledged pursuant to a treaty in the most solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin, and contracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. Our treaty relations with Japan remain un changed. An imposing Embasey from that interesting and progressive nation visited this country during the year that is passing, but being unprovided with powers for the signing of a convention. In this country no conclu sion in tnat direction was reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opin ion which took place during their stay in this country, has led to a mutual appreciation of the interests which may be promised when the revision of the existing treaty shall be undertaken. In this connection I renew my recommenda tion of one year ago, that, to give importance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Janau and China, and to fur ther aid in maintaining the good opinion of those people, and to secure to the United States a share of the commerce destined to flow between the two great nations and the balance of the commercial world, an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these coun tries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equal ity with the representatives ot Great Britain or some other powers. As now situated our representatives in Japan or China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those countries who know our lan guage imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of employes in foreign business ! houses, or the interpreters to other foreign I ministers. THE TERRITORIES. I renew the rcconimendrtion made on a pre vious occasion, of the transfer to the Depart, meat of the Interior, now to which they seem more appronriately to belong, all tbc powers and duties in relation to the territories with which the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom. RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS. Congress, from the beginning of the govern ment. lias wisely made provisions for tbo re lief of distressed seaman in foreign countries. No similar provision, however, baa hith erto been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad other ban seamen. It is unelerstood to be customary with other governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or sub jects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect are re commended in the case of citizens of the United States destitute or sick under such circumstances. Its is well known that such citizens resort to foreign countries in great numbers. Thou Hi most of them are able to boar the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some, who through accident or otherwise, become penniless and have, no friends at home able to succor them. Persons in this situation must either perish, cast themselves upon tbo charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the pri vate charge of onr own officers, who usually, e-en with the most benevolent dispositions, hevc nothing to spare for such purn r jet. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be allowed, care will be taken to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect and that it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily be stowed.

It is very doubtful, howevor whether any further reduction of so vexations a burden upon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events, as a measure of justice to the holders of the nation’s certificates of indebt edness, I would recommend that no more legislalion be had upon this subject, unless it be to correct errors of omission or commission in the present laws, until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the current expenses of the Government, pay the interest on the public debt, and provide tor the sinking fund established by law. The preservation of our national credit is of great importance. Next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to provide a national currency of fixed unvarying value as compared with gold, and as soon as practical, having due regard for the interests of the debtor class and the vicissi tudes of trade and commerce, and convertible into gold at par. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department, for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1871, to be $35,799,991.82, and for the fiscal year ending June 30tb, 1872, to be $85,372,157.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of $427,834.62. Estimates for military appropria tions for the next fi-cal year ending June 30, 1873, arc $33,801,378.78. The estimates of the chief of engineers are submitted separately, for fortifications and river and harbor improve ments, and for public buildings and grounds, and the Washington acqueduct. The affairs of the freedmen's bureau, have all been trans ferred to the War Department, and regula tions have been put into execution for the speedy payment of bounty pay, &c.. due to colored soldiers properly coming under that bureau. All war accounts for money and property prior to 1871 have been examined and transmitted to the Treasury for final settlement. During the fiscal year there has been paid for transportation on railroads $139,000, of which'sßo,Bs7 was over the Pacific railroads. For transportation by water, $6,- 263,752, and by stage. $4,897,584, and for the purchase of transportation animals, wagons, liirc of teamsters, &c., $92,465,064. About •§370,000 have been collected from Southern railroads during the year, leaving about $4.- 000,000 still duo. The Quartermaster has examined and trans mitted to the accounting office for settlement $36,717,292 of claims by loyal citizens for Quartermaster’s stores, taken during the war. isnbsisting supplies to the amount of §8,904,- 812 have been issued to Indians. The annual average mean strength of the army was 24.210 white and 2,494 rolorod soldiers.* The total deaths for the year reported were 367 white and 54 colored. The distribution of the medi cal and surgical history of the war ia yet to be ordered by Congress. There exists an absolute necessity for a medical corps of the full number established by the act of Congress of July 28th, 1866, there being now fiftv-niue vacancies, and the number of successful candidates rarely ex ceeds eight or ten in one year. RIVER AND HAiBOR IMPROVEMENTS. The river and harbor improvements have been carried on with energy and economy. Though many are only partially completed, the results have saved to commerce many times the amount expended. The increase of commerce with greater depth of channels, greater security in navigation and the saving of time adds much to the wealtli of the conn try, and increases the resources of the govern ment. The bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island has been completed, and the proper site has been determined upon for t Lie bridge at La Crosse. The able and exhaustive report made by the commission appointed to investigate the Sutro Tunnel has been transmitted to Congress. THE SIGNAL OFFICE. The observations and reports of the Signal Office have been continued. Stations have been maintained at each of the principal lake, seaport and river cities. Ten additional sta tions have been established in the United States, and arrangements made for exchange of reports with Canada,and a similar exchange of observations is contemplated with the West India Islands. REFORM IN THE MILITARY SERVICE. The favorable attention of Congress is in vited to the following recommendations of the Secretary of War: a discontinuance of the ap pointment of extra Lieutenants to serve as adjutants and quartermasters; the adoption of a code providing specific penalties for well de fined offenses; so that the inequality of sen tences adjudged by Court Martials be adjust ed; the consolidation of accounts, under which expenditures are made, as a measure of econo my ; a reappropriation of the money for the co truction of a depot at San Antonio ; the tiuo to the site being now perfected ; a special act placing the cemetery at the city of Mexico on the same basis as other national ceme teries ; authority to purchase sites for military posts iu Texas ; the appointment of commis sary sergeants from non-commiasioncd officers as a measure for securing the better care and protection of supplies; an appropriation for the catalogue table of the anatomical section of the army medical museum ; a re-appropria tion of the amount for the manufacturing of breech-loading arms should the selection be so delayed by tho board of officers as to leave the former appropriations unexpended at the close of ths fiscal year; the sale of such arsenals east of the Mississip pi as can ho spared, and the proceeds applied to tho establishment of one large arsenal of construction and repair upon the Atlantic coast, and the purchase of a suitable site for a proving aud experimental ground for heavy ordnance; the abrogation of laws which deprive inventors in the United States service from deriving any benefit from their invention; the repeal of the law prohibiting promotions in staff corps ; a con tinuance of work on the coast defenses ; the repeal of the seventh section of the act of July 13th, 1866, taking from engineer soldiers the per diem granted to other troops ; a limitation of time for the presentation of subsistence supplies under the act of July 4th, 1864; and a modification in the mode of the selection of cadets for tho military academy, in order to enhance the usefulness of tbe acade my which is impaired by reason of the large amount of time necessarily ex pended in giving new cadets a thorough knowledge of the more elementary branches ot learning which, they should acquire before entering the academy ; also an appropriation for philosophical apparatus and an increase in the number and the pay of the military acad emy band. CHEAP TRANSPORTATION. The attention of Congress will be called du ring its present sess’on to various enterprises tor the more certain and cheaper transporta tion of the constantly increasing surplus of western and southern products to the Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one that will force itself upon the legislative branch of the gov ernment sooner "or later, and I suggest, there fore, that immediate steps be taken to gain all available information, to insure equitable and just legislation. 

WATER CONNECTION. *o ponuect the Mississippi Valiev : with the Atlantic at Charleston, S. C.. and Sa | vannah, Ga., by water by way of the Ohio and Tennessee river and canals and slack water na\ igatiou to Savannah and Ocmulgee rivers has been surveyed and a- report made by an accomplished engineer officer of the army. Second and third new routes will be pro postal for the consideration of Congress, namely, by an extension of the Kanawha and James Rivers Canal to the Ohio, and by sa cx j tension of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I 1 ytu not prepared to recommend Government aid to tiieso or other enterprises, nntil it is clearly shown that tbeylarojnot only of Nation si interest, but that when completed they will I ho of a value commensurate with their cost, That production increases more rapidly than the means of transportation in our country has been demonstrated by past experience. That the unprecedented growth in population and projects at the whole country will require additional facilities and cheaper means for the more bulky articles of commerce to reach tide water, and a market will be demanded in the near tuturo is equally demonstrable. I would therefore suggest that either a committee or a commission be authorized to consider this whole question and report to Congress some future day, for its better guidance in legisla ting on the important question. THE RAILROADS. The railroads of the country have been rap idly extended during the last few years to meet the growing demands of producers, and reflect much credit upon capitalists and the manager* engaged in tneir construct!cn. In addition to these, a project to facilitate commerce by building a ship canal around the Niagara Falls on the United States Side, which has necn agitated for many years, will, no doubt, be called to your attention in this session, as looking to the great future of the count; and the increasing demands of com merce. It might be well, while on this subject, not only to have examined and reported upon the various practicable routes for connecting the Mississippi with tide water on the Atlan tic, but the feasibility of an almost continuous land-locked navigation from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, Such a route along our coast would be of great value at ail times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war. Nature has provided the greater part of this route, and the obstacles to be overcome are eas ily within the skill of the engineer. I have not alluded to this subject with the view of having any farther expenditure of public money at this time than may be neces sary to procure and place all necessary infor mation before Congress in an authentic form, to enable it hereafter,if deemed practicable and worthy, to legislate on the subject without delay. THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith accompanying, explains fnllv the condition of that branch of the public service, its wants and deficiencies, expenses incurred during the past year, and appropriations for the same. It also gives a complete history of the services of the navy for the past year, in addition to its regular services. It is evident that unless stops are taken to preserve our navy, that in a very few years the United States will be the weakest nation upon the ocean of all great nations. With an energetic progres si re business people like ours, penetrating and forming business relations with every part of the known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect of our flag abroad is necessary for the full protection of their rights I recommend the careful consideration by Congress of the recommendations made by the Secretary of the Navy. POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General furnishes a full and satisfactory ex hibit of operations of the postoffice department daring the year. The ordinary revenues of the Deparnnent for the fiscal year ending June 30rh, 1872, amounted to $21,915,426.37, and the expenditures 526,658,192.21. Compared with the previous fiscal year, the increase of revenue was $187,838,095, or 9.37 per ceu<.,and the increase of expenditures 5226,808,823, or 9.29 per cent. Adding to the ordinary r<- venues the annual appropriation of 5700,000 for free matter, and the amounts paid to theleubsi dics on mail steamships linos from special appropriations, the deficiency paid out of the general treasury was §331,- 776.595, an excess of 588,970.728* over the de ficiency for the year 1871. Other interesting statistical information relating to our rapidly ext ending postal sendee is furnished in this report. The total length of railroad mail routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was 57.911 miles, 8,077 additional miles of such service having been put into operation during the yeai. Eight new lines of railway postoffiees have been established, with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 24,362,500, an increase of 4,066,502, or twenty p.er cent, over the number in 1871; and the postage thereon amounts to $187,125,725. The total weight of the mails exchanged with European countries exceeded 820 tons. The cost of the United States trans-Atlantic mail steamship service was $22,030,170. The total cost of the United States ocean steamship service, including the amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steamers, was §102,- 702,097. The following are the only steamship lines now receiving subsidies for mail service under special acts of Congress. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company receive $500,000 per an num for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco, Japan and China, which will be increased to $1,000,000 per annum, and a semi-monthly mail on and after October Ist; the United States and Brazil mail steamship company receive $15.- 000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between New York and Bio de Janeiro, Brazil; and* the California, Oregon and Mexico steamship company receive $75,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco and Hono- lain, Hawaiian Islands. Making the total amount of mail steamship subsidies at pres ent 5725,000 per annum. Our postal commu nications with all parts of the civilized world have been placed upon a most advantageous footing by the improved postal conventions ami arrangements recently concluded with the leading commercial countries ot Europe and America, and the gratifying state ment is made that with the conclusion of a sat isfactory convention with Franco, the details of which have been definitely agreed upon by the head of the French Postal Department subject to the approval of the Minister of Fi nance, little remains to be accomplished by treaty for some time to come in respect there to a reduction of rates on improved facilities of postal intercourse. Your favorable consideration is respectfully invited to the recommendations made by the Postmaster General for an increase of service from monthly to semi-monthly (trips on the mail steamship ronte to Brazil for a subsidy, in view of the establishment of an American line of mail steamers between San Francisco, New Zealand and Australia; for the establishment of postoffico savings banks, and for the in crease of the salaries of the heads of bureaus. THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE. I have heretofore recommended the aboli tion of the franking privilege, and see no rea son now for changing my views on that sub ject. It not having been favorably regarded by Congress, however, I now suggest a modi fication of that privilege, to correct‘itsjglaring and costly abuses. THE POSTAL TELEGRAPH. I recommend, also, tho appointment of a committee or commission to take into con sideration the best method equitable to pri vate corporations who have invested their time and capital in the establishment of tele graph lines, of acquiring the title to all the telegraph lines-now in operation, and of con necting this service with the postal service of the nation. It is not probable that ibis sub ject could receive tho proper consideration during the limits of a short session of Con gress, but it may bo initiated, so that further action may be fair to the government and to the private parties concerned, THE OCEAN MAIL SERVICE. There are but three lines of ocean steamers, namely, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, between San Francisco, China and Japan, with provision made for semi-monthly service after October Ist. 1873 ; the United States and Brazil line, monthly, and the California, New Zealand and Australian line, monthly, plying between the United States and lore-gu ports, and owned and aperated under our flag. I earnestly recommend that such liberal con tracts for carrying the mails be authorized with these lines, as will insure their con tinuance, if the expediency of extending the aid of tho Government to the lines of steamers which hitherto have not received it should bo deemed worthy of the consideration of Con gress. Political and commercial objects make it advisable to bestow such aid on a line under our flag between Panama and Western and South American ports. By these means much trade now diverted to other countries, might be brought to us, to the mutual advan tage of this c uutry and those lying in that quarter of the Continent ot America. OUR OCEAN COMMERCE. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows an'alarming falling off in the carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years, an:l even for the past year-. I do not , believe that'the public treasure can be belter expended iu the interest of the whole people than iu trying tq recover this trade. An ex penditure of five million dollars per annum for the next five years if it would restore to ns our proportion of the carrying, trade of the world, would bo profitably ex pended. The price of labra- iu Europe has so 1 much enhanced within the Hst few vears that $35,00 a "Fear, in Advance. I the cost of building and operating ocean I steamers m the United States i‘s not so much greater than in Europe, and I believe tho time has arrived for Congress to take this sub ject into serious consideration. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Detailed statements of the disbursements through the Department of Justice will be furnished by the report of the Attorney Gen eral, and though these have been somewhat incicased l>y the recent nets of Congress to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of the Union, and to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the c mted States, and the amendments there to. I cannot question the necessity and salu tary effect of these enactments. Reck less and lawless men, I regret to say have associated themselves to gether in some localities to deprive other citizens of the right guaranteed them bv the Constitution of the United States, and to" that end have committed deeds of violence But the apprehension and punishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the re pression of such disorder. I do not doubt that a great majority of the people in all parts of the country favor a fall enjoyment bv all classes ot persons, of these rights, to which hey are entitled under tho Constitution and the laws, and to invoke the aid and influence o . :t citizens, to prevent organizations whose objects arc by unlawful means to inter faie with these rights. I look with confidence to the time not far distant, when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will in t c , e . 1 ?. n abandonment of all combinations prohibited by the acts referred to, and when it will ho unnecessary to carry on prose cutions or inflict punishment to protect citizens from _ the lawless doings of such combinations. Applications have oeen made to me for tho'.pardon of persons convicted of a violation of said acts, upon the ground that clemency in such cases would tend to tranquilize the public mind ;*and to test tho virtue of that policy, I am disposed ns far as my sense of justice will permit, to give to these applications a favorable consid eration, but any action thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in my de termination to enforce with vigor such acts sc long as tho conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the coun try. It is much to be regretted, and is re gretied by no one more than myself, that a necessity has ever existed to execute the en forcement act. No one can desire more than I, that the necessity of applying it may never again be demanded. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. The Secretary of the Interior reports satis factory improvement and progression in each of the several bur aus under the control of the Interior Department. They are all in ex cellent condition. The work,which in some of them for years has been in arrears, has been brought down to a recent date, and in all the current business has been promptlv dis patched. THE INDIANS. The policy which was adopted at the begin ning of the administration with regard to the management of the Indians, has been as suc cessful as its most ardent friends antici pated. Within so short a time it has reduced the expense of i their management, decreased their forages 1 on the white settlements, tended to give the largest opportunity to the extension of the great railways through the public domain, and pushing of settlements into more remote districts of the country and at the same time improve the condition of the Indians. The policy will be maintained without any change, excepting such as further experience may show to be necessary to render it more effi cient. The subject of converting the so-called In dian Territory, south of Kansas unite a home tor the Indian, and erecting thereon a terri torial form of government, is one of great im portance as a complement of the existing In dian policy. The question of removal to the territory has within the past year been pre sented to many of the tribes resident upon other and less desirable portions of the public domain, and has generally been received by them with favor. Asa preliminary step to the organization of such a territory it will he necessary to confine the Indians now resident therein to farms of proper size, which should be secured to them in fee, the residue to be used for the settle- | mentof other friendly Indians. Efforts will be made in the immediate future to induce the removal of as many peacibly disposed In dians only to the Indian territory as can be settled properly, without disturbing the har mony of those already there. There is no other location now available where a people, >vho are endeavoring to acquire a knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits, can be as well accommodated as upon the unoccu pied lands in the Indian territory. A territorial government should, however, protect the Indians trom the inroad of whites for a term of years, until they have become suf ficiently advanced in the arts of civilization to guard their own rights, and from the disposal of the lands held by them for the same pe riod. THE 

PUBLIC LANDS. During the last fiscal year there were dis posed of out of public lauds 11,864,975 acres, a quantity greater by 1,099,270 acres than was disposed of the pvevions year. Of this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for cash; 380,160 acres located with military warrants; 4,671,333 acres taken for homesteads ; 693.613 ; acres locatsd with college scrip ; 3.554,887 I acres granted to railroads; 465,347 acres ! granted to wagon roads ; 714,255 acres given I to states as swamp land, and 5,670 acres i looated by Indian scrip. The cash receipts j from all sources in the land office I amounted to $3,218,100. During the same i period, 22,016,608 acres of the public lands were surveyed, which, added to the quantity ! before surveyed, amounts to 383,364,780 acres, I leaving 1,257,633,623 acres of the public lands still unsurveyed. I The reports from the subordinates of the I land office contain an interesting information regard of their respective districts. They uni formly mention the fruitfulness of the soil dur ing the past season, and the increased yield ot all kinds of produce. Even in those states and territories where mining is the principal busi ness, agricultural products have exceeded the local demand, and liberal shipments have been made to distant points. THE PATENT OFFICE. During the year ending Sept. 30th, 1872, there were issued from the Patent Office, 1,362 patents, 233 extensions, 556 certificates aud registers of trade marks. During the same time 19,587 applications for patents, including re-issues and designs, have been received, and 3,100 caveats filed ; and the fees received dur ing the same period amount 570,095,986, and total expenditures to $62,355,390, making the net receipts over the expenditures, $7,740,- 066. Since 1836 200,000 applications for patents have been filed, and about 134,000 patents is sued—the offices being conducted under the same laws and general organization as were adopted at the original inauguration, when only from 100 to 500 applications were made per annum. The Commissioner shows tnat the office has outgrown the original plan, and that anew organization has become necessary. This subject was presented to Congress m a special communication in February iasi., with my approval and the approval ut toe Secretary of the Interior, and the sugges tions contained in said communication were embraced in the bill that was reported to the ! House bv the Committee on Patents at the i last session. Tiie subject of the reorganiza tion of tho Patent Office as contemp.ated by ! the bill referred to is of such importance to I the industrial interests <ff Iho countri, that! ; commend it to tho attention ot Congress. : The Commissioner also treats ihc subject ot I the separation of the Patent Office from the Department ot the Interior, Hus suoject is ! also embraced in the bill heretofore refer 'C The Commissioner complains of the want of ! room for the model gallery, and tor the corn ing force and necessary files of the office, it is impossible to transact the business of the office properlv without more room m which to arrange files and drawings, that must be con sulted hourly in the transaction of the busi ness of the whole patent office. A Guiding will soon be needed if it is not already, for the | accommodation of the business of the patent ; office. PENSIONS. i The amount paid for pensions in J 1 } 0 last fis cal voar was >30.169,340, all amount lar^ r $3,708,438 than was paid during the preceding year. Of this amount $2,313,409 we P under the act of Congress of Feoruary . , 1871, to the survivors of the war of 18 .* annual increase of pensions by the le„, * of Congress has more than kept Poo \uth the natural vetrrlv losses from the rolls, li e act of Congress of Juno Bth, 1872. has added an estimated amount of $750,000 per animm to tho rolls, without increasing the numbers pensioners. We cannot, therefore, look for a y substantial decrease in t he expenditures of t us department for some time to come, or so long as Congress contiuucs io cuuuge The dates of pensions. Th- whole number of soldiers enlisted in the war of the rebellion was 2,(188,523. The total number of claims for invalid pensions is 176,500 being but six per ?£nt, of the whole number of enlisted men. iiie total number of claims on hand at the be " .the year was 01,600; (be number rc ,, , j’j ll ," the year 26,574; the number dia- Un™° v® making a net gain of 1,264. n,, +n m on!i ° f claim s now on file is 79,085. n ,ie 3 th of June, 1872, there were on the 9-545 invalid military pen sioners, and 113,018 widows, orphans and de pendent relatives, making a total of 208,923 army pensioners. At ihc same time there were on the rolls the names of 1,449 navy pen sioners, and 1,730 widows, orphans, and de pendent relatives, making the whole number of naval pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage of the act to pro vide pensions for the survivors of the war of 1812, 36.551 applications prior to June 30th, 1872. Of these there were allowed during the last fiscal year 20,126 claims; 4.845 were re jected during the year, leaving 11,580 claims pending. The number of pensions of all classes granted during the last fiscal year was 33,838. During that period there dropped from the rolls, for various causes, 914 ntmes, leaving a grand total of 232,229 pensions on the rolls on the 30th of Juno, 1872. It is thought that the claims for pensions on ac count of the war of 1812 will all be disposed of by the Ist of May, 1873. It is estimated that $3,048,000 will be required for the pension service during the next fiscal year. NO. 5. THE CENSUS. I The ninth census is almost completed. Its completion is a subject of congratulation, in asmuch as the use to be made of the statis tics contained depends very greatly on the promptitude of publication. The Secretary of the Interior recommends that a census bo taken in 1875, which recommendation should receive the ready attention of Congress. The interval at present established by the federal census is s.- long that the information obtained at the decimal periods, as to the ma terial condition, wants and resources ot the nation, is of little practical value after the ex piration of the first half of that period. It. would probably obviate the constitutional pro vision regarding the decimal census, if a cen sus taken in 1875 should he divested of all po litical character, and no apportionments of Congressional representation he nude under it such census, coming as it would, inthelast year of the first century of our national existence, would furnish a noble monument of the pro gress of the United States during that cen tury. F.nucATioir. The rapidly increasing interest in education is a most encouraging feature in the current history of the country, and it is no doubt true that this is due in a great measure to the efforts of the bureau of education. That office is continually receiving evidences which abundantly prove its efficiency from the var ious institutions of learning and educators of ail kinds throughout the country. The report of the Commissioners contains a vast amount of educational details of great in terest. The hill, now pending before Crn gress, providing for the appropriation of part of the proceeds of the sales of public lands lor educational purposes, to aid the states in the general education of their rising genera tions, is a measure of such great importance to our real progress, and is so unanimously ; approved by the leading friends of education, that I commend it to the favorable attention of Congress. 

TERRITORIAL, AFFAIRS. Affairs in the territories are generally satis- I factory. The energy and business capacities ; of the pioneers who are settling up the vast domains not yet incorporated into states arc I keeping peace, in internal improvement and l civil government, with the older communities I In but one of them, Utah, is the condition o( ! affairs unsatisfactory. Except so far as the quiet of the citizen may be disturbed by real or imaginary danger of Indian hostilities, it has seemed to be the policy of the legislature of Utah to evade all responsibility to the gov ernment of the United States, and oven to hold a position in hostility to it. I recommend a careful revision of the pres ent laws of the territory by Congress, and the enactment of snch a law as the one propos and in Congress at its last session, for instance, or something similar to it, as will secure peace, the equality of all citizeus before the law, and the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy. Since ths establishment of a territorial gov ernment for the District of Columbia, the im provement of the condition of the city of Washington and surroundings, and the in creased prosperity ol the citizens, is observ able to the most casual visitor. The nation being a large owner of property in that city, should bear with the citizens of the District its just share of the expenses of these improvements. I recommend, therefore, in appropriation to reimburse the citizens for the work done by them along and in front of the public grounds during the past year, and liberal appropriations, in order that the im provement. and embellishment of the public buildings and grounds may keep pace with the improvements made by the territoritorial au thorities. AGRICULTURE. The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives a verv fail and interesting ac count of the several divisions of the Depart ment —the horticultural, agricultural, statis tical, entomological and chemical, and the benefits conferred by each upon the agricul tural interests of the country. The whole re port is a complete history in total of the workings of that Department in all of its branches, showing the manner in which the farmer, merchant, and miner is informed, and the extent to which he is aided in his pursuit. T. e Commissioner makes one recommendation that measures be taken by Congress to protect and induce the planting of forests, and suggests that no part of the public lands should be disposed of without the condition that one-tenth of it bo res. rved in timber when it exists, and where it does not exist inducements be offered for planting it. CENTENNIAL CLEBBATION. In accordance with the terms of an act of Congress approved March 3d, 1871, providing for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of American Independence, a commissson has been organized consisting of two members from each of the states and territories.
