WHY alldl '1.&1EXSEMEE Br. EXCI.I - DEBT Our co temporary of the Nashville Ban- r.cr treats this subject so judiciously, and at the same time so forcibly, that we adopt and copy his suggestions entire. According to the rulinc of the most ultra Republicans, says that journal, we have performed a'., the obligations of the new compact of restoration, even had w e ever been out of the I'nion : and according to . .swf-nr- ,.f thtir own creation, we c ver have been out of the Union. afw the ordinance of separation was K-wl ia the midst of war. Mr :.Iay:-aBB sat in the House and Mr. Johnson in the Senate, as repsesema- . lions from Tennessee: and throughout the conflict officers and soldiers from Tennessee served in the United States urmy, and were put on a par with troops from other States. In the Republican Convention which assembled at Baltimore, in eighteen hundred and sitxty-foun for the nomina¬ tion of a President and Vice-President, Tennessee was thought sufficiently in the Union to furnish the second name upon the National ticket, and thus a cit¬ izen of Tennessee, by succeeding events, all within the conjecture of that Con¬ vention, i Presideut of the United States. Before the war had closed a civil gov¬ ernment was organiied ; the amendment to the Constitution was passed ; and the (State wheeled completely in the line of lhe existing Administration policy of Mr. .Lincoln. The people recognised the new order f things, and selected a delegation to Congre. compos1 of the most unex¬ ceptionable material. Judge Patterson a son-in-law the President, and a Unionist of East Tonne-' of un- ejalvooal lovaltv. and Mr. Fowler, Comptroller of the Provisional Govern¬ ment of which Andrew Johnson was the head, were selected a- Senators. No one can take issue with their antecedents ..r present opinions. In the several dis¬ tricts, partie-ilarly that of Mr. Cooprrn, Mr. Maynakh. Col. Hawkins and Col- Htokes. the two former unabating Union men from the first, and the two latter, officers in the military service of the United StaU. tlie list is almost as unblemished, ft is true, that grave doubts are cast upon the record if Mr. Aknell, who is charged with having been. rebel contractor for ther, and of being of doubtful loyalty until the war ceased to bo. so. But it must be n-memlred that the people never a.!.vted him at all: that they elected a 'ood Union man and true, Mr. Horsey 'I-hovas. and that Mr". Aknei.l owes his certifleate to the illegal, unfair and par tial ruling of tilt Secretary of s;tate. bo that Tennessee, as a State, ought not to suffer on his account, and it would lie easy to throw him out and give the scat he claims to its rightful owner. Again, it is true that the Legislature lias refused to pass the negro testimony IjUI. But thb, let it be borne in mind, was not at the Instance of any rebel in- Jluence, go-calied. It was done, as Gov. Rbownlow feared and said it would lie. by "East Tennessee loyalists," who, next to a rebel, Lte a nigor. The con- iervat:ves ought not to be nude respon- tible tor the actions of the radicals; and Vennessee ought not to be made, by the ltt publicans in Congress, pay the debts of their own friends in our local General .Vsstmoly. There is no reason In the world, con¬ tinues the Banner, why Tennessee should r kept out in the cold. Iff we have not i vt rytiiing which we ought :.. d . we i mid not satisfy the demands of ultra men in the next hundred years; iind ii their action ia refusing us admis¬ sion is to be taken as a standard, the rest of the Southern States never will get lck into the I'nion. We have a great w eight to carry in the present Legislature and State Govern¬ ment, ve admit. But if it is unpopular in the North, it is equally unpopular uere ; and folks at a distance should not abuse us for its shortcominge. When ' :eel sits down to give Gov. LrfjW castigation. he should never forget that Gov. Bbow.vixiw rep- .-c-tiii- only a tithe of the population. We re: use to be made responsible for him. W. !.. ;. live .

The wire-, i: was pro vt I. liaM been so out of place for more than twenty-four lipurs preceding the accident. The pla.ntiff claims that in consequence of the negligence of the defendants his apparel was damaged, and claimed forty dollars damages. The defendants proved that they were renewing the posts and repairing the wires on Saturday, and that when they .juit work they secured the ends of tin- wires by twisting and fastening tbeni around t ie po-ts. The jury returned a verdict for ten dollars for plaintiff. We learn from Belleville. 111., that two horses were stolen Sunday night from a man named Meyers, tenant on tic- farm of K. Kraft, two milest south of inaicity, and the farmhouse afterward- tired and burned. There was a report in BellevUle at the time our informant left that two children were burned to death in the house, but it is hoped that tbi- may jirove to be not true. t& By the Prussian law of divorce, n is required that, before ulterior proceed- ings, the pa-tor of the quarreling pouple shall have an portunity of reconciling them.

It is safe to say none ever gave greater satisfaction wnen reeeivea. its views, on the most momentous subjects, domestic and foreign, that ever concerned the nation, are full of wisdom, and are conveyed with great fon-e and dignity. In regard to reconstruction, the Presi¬ dent liegius by defining with great clear¬ ness the mutual relations of the Constitu¬ tion and the States. He shows that each is vital u the other, uud that the theory that States could be xtsnguished would lie fatal io the Constitution, lhe military rule over the insurrectionary Mates was an exceptional eorulilion, imposed by necessity, and is to be terminated just ass. m as those state-can ne iiroiurm again into a harmonious i.e.. on the National (Jovernment. ror tins end the Government has diligently labored, and w ith -uch success, as the President lielieves, that now- nothing remains to U- done by the late erring States but the ratification of tike Constitutional Ameud- forever nrohil'iting slavers, as a pledge of perpetual loyalty and is-a.-c.

The President very proieri oevoies the creater juirt oi nis message io me discussion of th" jwlicy which the Gov¬ ernment ought to pursue toward the States which attempted to secede, and places himself, we are giao io say, in direct opposition to Uie foolish ;.nd vin¬ dictive policv of the Republicans as de¬ veloped by the representatives of that partv in Congress. We wish we could lielieve that the President will have the manliness and lirmue-s to adhere to the -tand that he ha-taken. For if Use blind fanaticism and hatred of the Republicans i- t u- trol the Government, ami the south is to tie dragooned into conceding ui uie ne¬ groes that perfect equality which Mr. --uuiner demands for theni. we must not only prrpare ourselves to witness the ruin of the unhappy white people ,.t that -action of our country, but we must con- ....,,,. ih- i-stalilishmeut of an Empire in Mexi"i and make up our minds not to enfon-e against England our just claims for reparation of the w rongs, which slie did us in the hour ot our irouoie anu which are set forth in tne rresiuen- s message with a cleariu which ought I swell our hearts, and Hush our faces with indignation and .iu-t rebutment. Eor, to our niiuu. nothing to more plain than the fact that anv attempt to enforce the revolutionary potty of the Republican party will so weaker th.- Government that it cannot dare Ui resist the encroach¬ ments of the enemies of Republicanism, or resent the w rong- thai England has done us. But to revert to the message. The Pre-i.lcnt say-that, accurdine to the true theory of the Constitution, no State has seceded, and that it has therefore been his object IB W eats lllWl the H aceoftlie country by restorimr the rightful energy of the General Government and the States; that to this end Provisional Governors have lK?en appointetl for the States, Convention- called, iioveriiors elected, I,d.'islajures as- bbsAbsL and Senator, hnd Iteii- r.-ciitaiive- ehosea to the Congress ..f the United States; the courts of tlie I'nited State- have re-opened, as far as practicable, Custom Hon-.- established, sad post QtBces opesed, etc.; and that nothing now remain-to I done by the Slate- w ho-, powers have been io long in abeyance but "to resume their place in the two branches of the National Legis¬ lature, and thereby complete tiie work of restoration." While We cannot aCOepf the President's theory that the State are not sovereign, and that they had no right to secede, yet it must Ik- admitted that the war was founht to establish, and that its result has practically established that theory, and it is obvious that it is the only the¬ ory, save that of the sovereignty of the StaU-, upm which the Union can lie re- estah i-l,, I. without utterly subverting the constitution.

And we re¬ gret to suv that we fail to defect in Hi'' latter anv of that spirit or pluck which we ha.thojK dtolind in Andrew Johnson. He devotes some two cqlunuis to an elab¬ orate niK.logy of hi-course since be lias lieen President. The substance of M r. Jolinsoii'sexplaiiation is, that he has bean trying to re-tore the constitutional rela¬ tion- of the Slates to the Federal Gov¬ ernment ! Now wc take direct issue ed''' him, and declare that he has lieen doing no such tiling. Tilt Southern States, after. the siuTeudcr of ttcli. Joe John¬ ston, ale I this w as sul.-ciUeiit to .Mr. Lin¬ coln's death, sioo.1 ready to resume their constitutional relations to the Federal Government, and Mr. Andrew Johnson w a- the very man who prevented them. It may not Is- popular, in these days of cowardly subserviency, to tell the Presi¬ dent such an unpalatable truth, but it is truth, ami the eternal justice of history will so reccd it, and all the whitewash¬ ing nit-wagc Mr. Johnson can w rile will not wipe it out. ' The finical theory about the States having "lost their vital¬ ity," being in a state of "suspended ani¬ mation"-:! kind of spiritual coma, we suppose is a corncob house iu which Mr. Johnson vainly imagines he hides himself. His policy is jierfeetly ap¬ parent ; he has been throwing tubs to the Abolition whale, and he might as well expect U make the hyena less fcr.s-i.ius by feeding him on blood, as to conciliate" the Abolitionists by yielding to them. Do we turn the lamb over to the wolf Ui preserve it ? Do we preserve true principles by yielding them up ? Then, too, what cruel mockery to tell the Southern people that they had lieen "Invited to participate in amending the Constitution!" Could there have been a more hitler jest over the grave of their eonst it lit ional liberties? And what shall we say of his perora¬ tion, that school boy fight over this ga-lo- rious free country a country so free that not a single newspaper south of the Poto¬ mac dare -; ak its lionest sentiments. A free country, forstsith, when eleven States are ruled by military dictation ! When churches are closed, when-uews- papers are suppressed, and even Sta'.j Convent! of -, instead of recording the will of their constituents, simply register the edicts of the Executive and State Departments at Washington! Tell us that America is free! We hurl back the foul libel. It is Cossack! Mr. Johnson's message on our nlfairs with France and England is vague and dreamy, and partakes of Us- Annus of the State Department. No tine can tell what it means. Hence the public on these s)iiiis arc as wise as ever. In conclusion we would say that there is still a wide divergence between Mr. Johnson's policy ami the Abolition pro¬ gramme, provided he can be Induced to adhere to it. -'egro suffrage is an es¬ sential clement their creed, and while he assentsorr. Ujr to th. ir theories, yet they have the light truly to regard him as really unconverted at Iteart until he assents to that. Upon this hinge- future events. Upon this will tlie interest in Congress hang. If they arouse him to lit what we believe Andrew Johnson is at heart, he may yet make himself a future. For once let him throw ofT the chains that now bind him, and array htonrirlf in the panoply of Truth, and the -horn Samson can bury all the Abolition Phil¬ istines' in irremediable ruin.

The Republican senatorial caucas re¬ convened to-day in one of the rooms ad- joiningthe Senate chamber, to consider Stevens' II nis.- joiui resolution for rais¬ ing a eeiiiiuittee of lifted! oq rtstonstruc- tion. Nearly all the Senators were pres¬ ent, and a dcliatc opened which lasted till noon, win the opening session of the Senate commenced Au adjourn¬ ment soon followed, however, of that liody, ami the caucus reassembled. The President's reconstruction policy was se¬ verely commented on by Sherman Chandler, Wade anil Wilson, and de tended by Senator Doolittle ill a speech of considerable force. The latter Was sustained by Dixon, Trumbull, Harris, Morgan and' Sprague. Finally amotion was made to strike out the Word "joint committee" aud insert the word "con¬ current," so as to return the resolution of certain parliamentary obligations, but that was lost. . Considerable debate was then had in the statement that the latter part of tlie Htmse resolution assumed to decide on the returns, qualifications and election of Senators. It was. urged that il was, therefore, both unparliamentary and unconstitutional, and should he changed to meet these objections. A vote was then taken, and by sixteen to fourteen, that feature was stricken out. The resolution was then adopted by the same vote, and as modified reads as fol¬ lows': Bctolved by thr. Smile and JToute in Cungrett AiucmUcd, That a committee of Ofteen members sluill be appointed, nine of whom shall lie members of the House and six of the Senate, who shall inquire into the condition of the States which formed the so-called Confederate Stales of America, and reirt whether amy of them are ctitit'ed to beRepresent- alive- in either House of Congress, with leave to rt-jsirt at any time by bill or otherwise. Senator Anthony was instructed hi present the resolution to'the Senate to¬ morrow. The vital part of the resolu¬ tion a- it passed Lhe House, ami which is stricken out by the Senate caucus, went so far as to inquire into the qualifications of th.- Senators and members eject from the Southern States. It is not lielieved that the Mouse will agree to these Sena¬ torial caucus modifications except with¬ out full debate. . , ., A bill presented In the House to-day by Mr. Julien, of Indiana, proposes to so amend the confiscation law as to forfeit real estate beyond the life term of the owner in nose of treason. The Senate ami House were flooded to-day with vigorous resolutions for the enfcieement of the Monroe doctrine. There were three different sets presented in the Senate, and two separate ones in the House. No action was taken on them, nor is there any likely to be at present. ltepivsenL'itive fJarfWd's bills intro¬ duced to-day, to facilitate commercial intercourse between the States, are in accordance with a paragraph in the An¬ nual Message. It prohibits a per capita tax by a State on passengers by rail or loat, and looks to an air Hue railroad be¬ tween Washington ami New York. The Secretary of the Treasury was on the floor of the House to-day for the first time thissessjon. and took the Iron clad oath antl entered upon his oflicial duties. (iui. Fogg, late Minister of Switzer¬ land, and islitor of the Concord IniUnxn- 3emt Democrat, was on the floir of the House to-day. The Mississippi and Louisiana delega¬ tions, now here, callisl ukui the Secre¬ tary of War to-day, in relation to the re¬ building of the lines at those -oints which were destroyed. He at once agreed to send a force to rebuild them, antl stated that his authority for so doing was that those States were under Military Governors. The Committee on Elections have lieen called to meet on Wednesday next, to take up the contested case of CoH rath aud Kurts, of Pennsylvania, and decide which is entitled to take the seat. Neither of them are on the rolls of the House, the Clerk having refused to place them there on the ground that neither has the Gov¬ ernor's certificate. Ba7"An artible in the commercial col¬ umns of the New- York Timet discourses thus; " If the great cVit ton question is to be re- garded as paramount i of which there is little doubt ,, the time is at hand toron- sl.ler on the growth and extent of culti¬ vation for the next year.
