The Erie Makes Another Cut and the Other Chicago Lines Scramble to Get on the Wagon. The agrents representing the different foa'ls and fast-freight lines at this point vere out early yesterday among shippers announcing a reduction on east-bound freight rates to take effect Dec. 7. Under the reduced rates grain and grain products and fertilizers will be carried lor 1SH cents ter one hundred, pounds, Indianapolis to Xsew York, with proportionate rates to fcther seaboard points. The rate on poultry and game Is reduced from C0'3 cent3 to 451 cents; on butter and from CO cent to 42 cents pc-r one hundred pounds; green hides, from 23 cents to 21 cents, and it is Expected that the rate on provisions will liow drop from 28 cents to 23 cents per one hundred pound.-. Freight men are not pleased that such a reduction has been ordered. .Lake navigation has Just closed, and now where the roads have opportunity to make a little money the rate goes off to such an extent that the revenue above actual cost of hauling the property in winter months is very small. ojitHountl Shipment from Chicago. East-bound shipments from Chicago last .week amounted to 43,432 tons, against 53,931 tons for the previous week, and 81,131 for the corresponding week last year.

The Wells-Far- f o company has contracted with President tuntlngton to pay the Southern Pacific a cash bonus of $1,700,0 "0 and per cent of the gross earnings of the express com pany over the Southern Pacific lines during the term of the contract. Further Cats by the Erie. The Erie yesterday announced the follow ing reductions in freight rates from Chicago to Nevr York: Starch, 20 cents; dried blood for fertilizing, 20 cents; green sheep pelts, 22!a cents.

The Monon is making an effort to get back some of the coal traftlc which it lost when shipments of i?tone from the Bedford quarries were so heavy, and is moving thre? carloads of coal now where il did one last year in November and December. The rport of William Sullivan, agent of the Fig Four at this point, shows that in the old depots it cost the company t5 to 70 cents to handle a carload of freight. In the new depots the conveniences are so much greater that it Is done at from 33 to CO cents per load. Superintendent Mansfield, of the Irdlan frrolis & VinoHTines. has been Investigating the light Fhipments of corn from points on that line, and says farmers tell him that when they can get S5.50 pr 1 pounds for hogs they will nut sell their com at 1TJ cents p?r bushel on the ear.

General Manager Frey pays these enirlnes do not mean new mileage, but better and additional train service. For two years, he says, the company has needed more power. Last week the shipments cf live stock from this market to Eastern markets reached four hundred carloads, and this week promises even larger shipments.

The only time the colored people travel ex tensively Is this month, and the company in December looks closely after the holi day month travel.

W. with blue prints of the plans and speci fications of the tvo depots, the Chicago & Northwestern proposing to build after much the same plan in Chicago. There are indications that the Cincinnati and St Louis passenger pool will go to pieces on Jan. 1. William IL Shattuc Is its commissioner and receives $3,000 a year for keeping the general pnienger agents from quarreling. An impression prevails I that E. O. McCormlck. passenger traffic I manager of the Bisr Four, and O. P. Mc- Carty, general passenger agent of the I Haltlir.ore & Ohio Southwestern, are such sensible officials that the expense, of this pool is unnecessary. It is evident that the heads of depart ments of the Pig Four lines have gotten their expenses down to about the minimum figure, as in October the gross earnings fell ?9i.G0G below those of October, 1832. while the net earnings fell below those of October last year but fS.uO).

DISTINGUISHED K. OF P. OFFICERS. They Gather Here and Start for Wash ington The Encampment. Gen. James R. Carnahan left at 3 oclock yesterday afternoon for Washington, D. C, via the C, H. & I. and the C. & O., to attend the meeting of brigade com manders to be held there for the purpose of perfecting arrangements for the Na tional Encampment next year. Accom panying him were the brigade officers from Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minne sota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The primary object of the trip is to make the preliminary arrangements for the next en campment, but General Carnahan will also devote considerable of his time to prepar ing the way to capture the encampment of 1S0S for this city, and thinks there is pros pects for success, though it is, a little early to make calculations. There are already in the field besides this city, Minneapolis, Omaha and Boston. It is estimated that the encampment will bring to the city where It is held 150,000 people, and by the time the encampment convenes at Wash ington next year there will be scores of candidates for It At Cincinnati the party leaving from this city will be joined by the brigade commanders of Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.

A Mysterious Crap Table in Leased Eooms Town Board Hears Itemoii- m strators Kapid Transit a Fact. Extreme vigilance has suppressed the gambling dens of the city, but some of the operators have gone to the suburbs. It 13 now evident that at least one party, and that one, as many assert, is William Tron, will locate in West Indianapolis. Tron has been seen several times lately In close con versation with Otto Kelpln, who keeps a saloon on West Morris street at the corner of Hadley avenue. These reports received some foundation when, it was discovered that Kelpin intends leasing his saloon and building. The lessees are Robert Smith and Henry Gannon. These men took posses sion of the business this morning, and, so far as they assert no other party 13 Inter ested with them. Kelpin was seen, and on being questioned as to whether or not Tron Intended to es tablish 'himself there, replied that it was the first time that he had even heard It mentioned that Tron was after it "The men to whom I have leased ray place," said he, "are in the business for them selves. I Intend to travel for a short time and these men leased my property from me. I Intend to take possession of my prop erty within at least six months." A citizen of West Indianapolis, and a close observer, Is willing to swear that he saw a crap table taken from a wagon yes terday afternoon and carried into the building. He says that it was carefully wrapped while in transportation to the build ing, but that he afterwards saw it partial ly unwrapied, and that he knew it by its "build." The building is a two-story frame building and contains about eight rooms, and h;us many handy exits. Marshal Ma holm said that ho as yet had heard nothing of this attempt of the gamblers to gain a foothold, but he guaranteed to the law abiding citizens of West Indianapolis that no gambling would be tolerated In that suburb. THE TOW.VS STREETS. Ilemonntrntors Appear Before the Board The I'nnnl 11111. The West Indianapolis Town Board of Trustees met In regular session last night. It was the appointed time for the hearing of remonstrances against the improvements of Sheffield avenue and Lambert street. Against Sheffield avenue there were no re monstrances, but Lambert street was as sailed by many and for various reasons. The chief complaints were against the cul verts and the quality of gravel used. At the Martha-street intersectiDn no culverts had been placed, and the dimensions of all other culverts had fallen short The gravel, as many said, was nothing more than fine sand, with a slight distribution of bowlders. Another protest was that the cost would be the same to those who had but a forty-foot roadway as to those with a sixty-foot roadway, the cost of all being 97 cents a lineal foot Contractor McCray rald that he could not get possession of the fde from the county clerk, and that he had made and placed the culverts accord ing to the town engineer's verbal direction, but, as to the quality of the gravel, it could not be beaten. He also introduced "Doc" Johnson as a witness to testify to Its mer its. Mrs. Isaac Johnson, one of the remon strators, and a cousin of "Doc" Johnson, refused to support hia testimony, as she claimed that he was a party to the contract The board will consider thi3 matter again next Monday night. Contractor McCray guaranteeing that In the meantime the cul verts will be fixed according to the profile. Bills against tie town, the total of which amounted to ne.irly $1,G00, were introduced. The Indianapolis Light and Power Compa ny was allowed, as usual, a warrant for their bill, the -warrant being $3S2.."0. The water company presented a bill of $73G.2 for water rent and repairs, but, as the loard thought the repair expense too high, the bill was laid over until next meeting. A warrant to the amount of 573 was or dered drawn, payable Jan. 15, ISO !, with in terest at 8 per cent. This is the amount of the interest that the school bonds are drawing. Other bills to the amount of $25.75 were ordered paid, either by warrant or cash. The estimates for the Improve ment of Harding street, from Morris street to the Belt railroad, were rad. The num ber of feat Improved was 3.C20, with a cost of $2,461.50. of which the town's share is $122.40. Louis Traugott, a saloon keeper on West Morris street asked permission to place a culvert in front of his property. Much dilatory discussion was brought out, but his petition was finally granted. Kcntueliry-Avenue Line Opened. The citizens of West Indianapolis are In a great state of happiness. The cause of It is that the first electric car over the Ken-tucky-avenua line made Its round trip without mishap yesterday afternoon. It is expected that electric cars will be run on schedule time to-day. The completion of this line gives West Indianapolis entire rapid-transit connection with the city. AMUSEMENTS. Young J. K. Emmet made hl3 first ap pearance in Indianapolis last night at the Grand. It has been a number of years since the late illustrious and well-remembered father of Emmet was here, but at hi3 last visit, It is said, he played to a crowded house. One would think that a great many more than went to see "Fritz," the younger, last night, entertaining the pleasant memories that they must of the inimitable original "Fritz," would have turned out if for nothing else than to see what tho scion of an illustrious father was like. The company gave "Fritz in a Mad house." It is not generally known, but it was the first performance of the piece, and things did net move as smoothly as it is promised they will. The audience was not skimpy, however, with its applause, and every point that called for recognition got It Emmet sang his songs and danced his little dances In a pleasing manner, but aside from this he was not the pronounced favorite that the favorable notices New York papers gave him would warrant There are a number of strong people in the caste, including Charles Bowser, a one time star; B. 11. Graham, formerly Daven jKrl'5 leading man, and H. W. Brinkley. Miss Emily Lytton, Mrs. Fanny Detiham Rousr Mh-.s Edith Evelyn and Miss Nettle Bourne are women of known reputaton who did all possible with their parts. The play, however, does not afford them great Iossibliltles. Little baby Sinnott, aed six, wno played with Emmet the elder from babyhood, shows unusual stage presence for one so youtntui, and took the house with her little skirt dance. "Fritz in a Madhouse" will be repeated during the re mainder of the engagement. At English's. "A Breezy Time," that opened at En glish's last night, is made up of a pro gramme of decidedly clever and entertaining variety features, with musical sketches hugely In the majority. Without flattery it is the best show of its kind that has ap peared In Indianapolis this season. At most any other time the management would be playing to packed houses. E. B. Fitz and Kathryn Webster, the two principal fun maker;, are only a small pun of the ptr fonr.ance. There Is dancing, singing and musL-al specialties galore. One of the most pleasing acts is a "Turkish Bell Gavotte," which combines sweet-toned accompani ment on i?iler bells, with a graceful d.inee of four beautiful young women attired in cootur.HM iar more breezy than even the name of tae piece can accurately convey. The company boils forth till Wednesday nUht Empire Theater JlydeN Comedlun. Hyde's Comedians and Miss Helene Mora must have been satisfied with the big ovation they received at the Empire The ater, where they opened a week's engage ment last night Not a scat was left va cant In any part of the house nnd standing room was at a premium before the curtain went up. The audience seemed immense ly pleased v.iih each act on the lengthy programme. When Miss Mora, the star, appeared the upplause Wius deafening, and it was reural minutes before she could make herself heard. She hiu the same Ioerful voice lor wliifrn she in noted, and her new songs were rendered in a man ner that captured her auditors. Her re pertore consists of the following aongs: "Always Mind Your Sioter Jeanle," "The Best Friend to All." "The Shin I Love" and the popular ditty "Daisy Bell." She was compelled to respond time and again. She was presented with beautiful lloral offerings from her many friends In this city. Wednesday night she will sing a new lullaby, Shut Eyes. Baby Bye." Among other features of the evening was the Zanetto troupe of Japanese jugglers. The way they handled burning torches and knives was startling. Joe Hayden and Oueen Hetherton kept the audience in good humor with ther witty dialogues. Miss Ola Hayden. in her singing and danc ing, was pleasing. Johnnie Ray and Em ma Sherwood kept the audience in laugh ter with their funny sketch, "My Hus band's Photograph." They were followed by Falke and Simons, a good musical team. The Allisons, a refined English singing, dancing and sketch team, scored a hit. The American Two Macs, a well known knock-about team, are favorites here. A novel act was that performed by Jessica, who danced the serpentine dance on the slack wire. The bill was brought to a close with Joe Hayden s laughable comedy entitled, "The Wild Wtst, or Mix tures." Hyde's Comedians are In for a big week at the Empire. Ladies and chil dren's matinee daily at 2. Pnrk Theater "The District Fnlr." That Mr. A. Y. Pearson has. In "The District Fair," presented for the first time here at the Park Theater yesterday, a play that combines all the elements of popularity cannot be doubted, in view of the large audiences that assembled to see It yester day, and who not only applauded but even cheered its stirring scenes. It 13 based upon a complicated story of crime, in which various Innocent people are Involved In suspicion, but are ultimately exonerated. There is plenty of sensation In it but throughout there is a good vein of comedy and some striking characterizations. In one scene a young man rides a horse through a closed door, out of a burning building, a picturesque representation of the dock and harbor by moon light and a hurdle race, with "real" horses, which i3 made very exciting. The company is one of unusual capacity. David Hanchett, an actor well known here, where he lived for a long time, plays John Graylock with force and intelligence. Miss Gertie Libby, a clever soubrette, plays Roxle. and Nell Scully makes a hit by a comedy impersonation of a tramp. The other people do what was intrusted to them capably, and the scenery throughout is un usually good. "The District Fair" will run all week at the Park, with matinees every day, and there is likely to be a continuation of the large audiences. Xoles. George Thatcher's spectacular extrava ganza, "Africa," which will be seen at the Grand the latter part of this weer. is an unusually brilliant stage production, more like an opera than anything else, and is presented bv a larcre and canable comnanv. No new production this season has made a greater hit than "Africa," and none has drawn larger audiences elsewmere. The sale of seats for Miss Marlowe's en gagement at the Grand all next week will not begin until next Thursday mornlmr. So many Inquiries are pouring In as to make it evident that there will be a very great demand, greater, indeed, than has been Known nere ror many months. Miss Mar lowe will give a different bill at every per formance, with the exception of the Satur day matinee, when "The Love Chase" will be repeated. This will also be the bill for the opening performance Monday night EVASIVE, WEAK. (Conclnded from First Pa are.) bers have been made aware that the mat ters spoken of are to be proposed in the committee. Such a course of a breach of the privileges of the House would not havts been tolerated in other times by a Presi dent, even by his most zealous adherents." GENERAL PALMER DISAGREES. Senator Palmer: "The President goes more into detail than usual with him. The suggestions are ' generally in the line of Democratic thought The paragraph relat ing to Hawaii merely showed the Presi dent's Intention to take the question up again. I have no especial objection to what h says regarding pensions, but I have an Idea that his impressions are wide of the mark concerning fraudulent pen sions. I do not know how it Is among the colored ex-soldiers of the South, but my Information 'leads me to believe that in the North not 2 per cent of the pen sions are " fraudulent." Senator Mitchell,-of Oregon: "I was very much surprised to learn from the mes sage's reference to Hawaii that the propo sition i3 really entertained by the admin istration to re-enthrone the (jueen. The nson bill which the President indorses strikes a fatal blow at all the industries of the Pacific coast." Senator Hale: "The message Is made up or details, as to Hawaii, he leaves that to the future. We expected him to favor the Wilson bill, and the Republicans are opposed to it Senator Lodge: "The meet of the mes sage was taken up with perfectly harmless routine business. rine clause about Hawaii appears to announce the extraordinary doctrine that it is our duty to overturn a government we have recognized In order to recognize another government. On this theory we ought to instantly restore Texas to Mexico, and France, which entered Into an alliance with us during the revolu tion, ought new to restore us, by force if necessary, to England. The statement In regard to the tariff contains one very inter ceding clause. Thl morning it was under stood that the Democratic members of the ways and means committee had not yet agreed as to new taxes to raise in ternal revenue, but the President states in his message what those new taxes are tj be. It has always heretofore be-c-n believed that under the Constitution the right to ' i nan curate monev bills rttorl wl.-h ln- House of Representatives. By thi3 mes sage It appears that new taxes are to be first determined by the President who communicates them to Congress, where there is nothing to be done except to adopt them. The recommendations in regard to the Civil-service Commission and the in crease of clerks for that service are in every way excellent Senator Power: "I understand the mes sage was printed in London this morning. It should have been given out there yester day so our British neighbors could have had time to tell us what to do atwut It" Senator Hawiey: "The message lacks vig or nnd I a disappointment The Presi dent's talk about tariff is commonplace in the extreme and his remarks concerning the work of the ways and means committee are not justified by any information the coun try has. There have been no meetings of the f ill committee to consider some of these questions." 

DEATH KNELL OF A REPUBLIC. Senator Manderson: "The message as a digest of the reports of the Cabinet officers Is valuable. As a communication recom mending to the Congress such measures as the President shall deem necessary and ex pedient it is of little value. Its recommen dations of legislative action by passage of laws are weakened by it3 statement of dlfh cultles that stand in the way of their enact ment Witn a clogged obstinacy and mulish stubbornness that persists in wrong doing, when full enlightenment shows the wiser course, the administration, having hauled down the fiag in Hawaii, now proposes to trample it in the uust. w e are to turn down a Christian republic to uphold a heathenish absolutism. We are to trade the goddess cf liberty for a harlot. Blount is to be maintained as paramount. It cer tainly was most fitting that th message. with Its abandonment of Americanism in internal commerce, its substitute of essence of free trad for protection. Its striking of the stars and bars m foreign lands, and its general surrender to England, should have been published this morning in London before It was made oublic in Washington. It is better lilted to the smoky atmosphere or tne great citv on tne l nams thun to the clear sunshine of the capital on the Potomac. The American people will con demn It. The English will applaud it." S-nator Dubois: "It is lacking In force. strength and Americanism, anl mu?t prove a great disappointment to tne country. Con cerning his recommendation about bonds and the International monetary commission, I can only say that it looks decidedly as if the President thinks he can deal with the financial affairs of the country better than Congress and the people. His statement of tho Hawaiian oue.-tlon will be generally and justly criticised and cannot be de fended." Senator Jones, of Nevada: "The message contains no suggestions or recommenda tlors which hold out any hope for silver while the present administration i3 in power." Senator Piatt: "Tt scarcely deserv es com ment." Senator Hansb rough: "It is very weak and tame. Doubtless the message would have contained more life if It had bc?n written aft.r Van Alen had declined the mission to Rome." Senator Shoup: "I was disappointed to as certiln that the President had not made any recommendation for the recognition of silver, and surprised to hear that the In ternational conference was to be aban doned." Senator Dixon: "tt was a very' wearisome message, and without any suggestions as to the immediate interests of the country. We had a riht to expect something concerning the currency. In which the message falls. His brief suggestion concerning the tariff contains nothing new." A number of other Senators, mostly Dem ocrats, were seen, but declined to express their views. Among these were Sherman, Aldrich, Hill. Daniel. Mills. Coke, Jones of Arkansas, Cockrell, Smith, Harris and Walthall. 

NEWSPAPER OP1XIOXS. Comment of the Republican. Demo cratic nnd Independent Pre. Mr. Cleveland's mental reluctance or ln- abllitj' to grasp questions at short range, or In specific detail, lias never been more evident than In this detune document. Philadelphia Bulletin (Rep.) Like other presidential documents emana ting from Mr. Cleveland, it has In It phrases that will be In use when more important portions of the message have been forgotten. Washington Star (Ind.) The Pioneer-Press can find In this mes sage evidences onlv of the unadmirable qualities of dullness and jealousy that leave even to Mr. Cleveland s partisans no room for enthusiasm over the beginnings or tne administration. St Paul Pioneer Press (Rep.) The President's message Is strictly a business document and not unr.eeessarlly long for the multitude of topics demanding attention. He makes the Wiln bill an administration measure. All Democrats should meet on the middle ground of the Wilson bill and stand together for it St Paul Globe (Dem.) ' The message of President Cleveland Is a perfect index of the character Of the man. It is terse, 'vigorous, clear, positive and comprehensive, and breatnes tne spirit or confidence in the people and in the strength. greatness, unity and manifestly glorious destiny of this Republic, and will Inspire careful, wise and adequate legislation. Kansas City Times (Dem.) There are onlv three things that the pub lic looked for in the President's message with interest. These are the tariff, Hawaii and silver. As to silver and Hawaii noth ing definite is stated, yet in regard to the latter we are to infer that the Queen will be restored. On the whole the message is a disappointment and betrays a conscious ness of weakness. Kansas City Journal (Rep.) The President's message is an elaborate, comprehensive and very positive document It expresses Mr. Cleveland's views with verv little regard for the opinions or sus ceptibilities of other people, or for the con ventionalities of public life. What he says about the tariff is elementary and theoret ical, and shows he is still a student or maxims rather than of markets. Louisville Commercial (Ind.) It would have been better If he had con fined himself to the Hawaiian question, to the tariff, finance and other important matters. We are glad to see tnat tne pres ident is not to be frightened from his posi tion on the pension ouestion by the clamor of the pension robbers. His approval of the tariff bill or the committee on ways and means does not promise well for sugar. New Orleans Times-Democrat (Dem.) The President stands squarely for tariff reform of the Wilson variety, but he Ig nores the lesson taught by the last election. and assumes that the people are anxious for a radical revision of the existing scnea ules. His allusion to the work of aiding the peopla through the work of tariff reform is misleading, tor It is perreciiy ciear mat me people are suffering to-day as a result of the general fear that the policy which he advocates will be carried out. t?pringneia Union (Rep.) If President Cleveland acted In good faith when he cited that measure (the silver re peal bill) ha should have taken occasion in this messatf to congress to urge tne en actment of legislation that would make good the bimetallic declaration of the re peal bill; but inasmuch as it is evident now. as It has been all along, tnat ne regarueu that declaration as mere buncomb, well- informed citizens will not be surcrised at his latest utterances on this subject Den ver Republican. A careful study of the message In all Its parts must convince the reader that Mr. Cleveland is guided by a wise caution be coming a leader whose party is setting out to change an order of things long estab lished. Those who expected something rad ical and sensational from him will be dis appointed. He stands as a pilot with his hand oil the helm and his eyes upon the stars and his chart, seeking the course ot safe and easy progress, but with no doubt as to the haven. Memphis Appeal-Ava lanche (Dem.) The President in changing the tariff. would consider not only the revenue but the labor ane' capital Involved. The latter involves protection. Moreover, the Presi dent admits that the proposed "tariff for revenue" measure, by an amusing paradox, depends for revenue upon direct taxes. The President is recreant to the Demo cratic platform, but is so much nearer the platform of American common sense. He is a compromise between an "Incidental pro tectionist" and a "low tariff Republican." Minneapolis Tribune. Th message will be read by the American people with mingled feeling3 of surprise, disappointment, vexation and uncertainty. The document makes a wilderness of words.- covering every possible subject De fore the executive for his oillcial cogniz ance and gives far more attention to di vers and sundry' irrelevant and unimpor tant things than it does to others which are not only foremost in the public mind at this time, ivit which must be earnestly con considered and. for the time being at-least, definitely settled. Philadelphia Telegraph (Rep.) Th Hawaiian matt?r is tiestined to make trouble for the administration, and Mr. Cleveland appears to have a foreboding of this, but he proposes to adhere to the pol icy which he has marked out for himself. 1 1 13 views on the financial question are wise. It is too soon yet to Judge accurate ly what sort of legislation the suspension of tho silver purchases will make neces sary, but we should, as' he advises, "reso lutely turn away from alluring and tempo rary expedients, determined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive plan." St. Loius Globe Demo crat (Rep.) On some important matters his recom mendations will be a disappointment The country has not agreed with the adminis tration on the Hawaiian question, and it is not likely to be converted by anything in the message. On the currency question the message Jr excellent and sound to the core. The President writes sensibly on the tariff, recognizing the necessity for action, while suggesting that changes must not be un necessarily sudden or unfair. In the rec ommendation for small, and if possible a temporary income tax, the President evi dently appreciates the unpopularity of such a measure. It Is to be regretted that ho dees not urge economy rather than an la ce me tax, however small. Washington News (Ind.) Mr. Cleveland's first regular message to the Congress elected with him cannot be called dictatorial. His recommendations are couched in mild terms, and, while earnen and unequivocal, do not dogmatize. On two points only is he emphatic about what he thinks Congress should do. The two points are economy in appropriations and vigor In dealing with tariff reform. If the message outlines any special policy it is that he will be content, from the hour when his pen traces the name of Grover Cleveland at the bottom of a tariff-reform bill, to be Judged bv his countrymen as an administrator. St. Iouls Republic (Dem.) The message of President Cleveland is such a document a3 his friends and sup porters expected from him, and it may be added that it is also such as his enemies ond opposers feared. Not a sentence in his message Is susceptible of a double con struction. What the President means he says. Kansas City Star (Ind.) THE 

LO.VDOX PRESS. President Cleveland Applnuded by Ills Itrili.ili Friends. Mr. Cleveland upon hi3 finesse Graphic. 13 to bo congratulated and consistency. London The portion of the message which displays President Cleveland at his best is his ref erence to Hawaii. Such a frank and honest odmisslon of a mistake nnd the declara tion of his Intention to reverse It reliects the highest possible credit upon the Pres ident, and indirectly upon the Nation also. London Telegraph. Pres'dont Cleveland's abstention from par ty rhetoric at the expanse of his opponents is all the more creditable, as his oppor tunities for the emplyment of scathing invectives were exceptional. It is surprising that the Hawaiian incidents are mentioned in the message without anv expression of shame or in llgnation. London Post The message is well worthy of the na tional crisis in which It Is delivered. The inference from Mr. Cleveland's facts and figures, whether he intended It pr not. Is that it is the true policy to cultivate close relations with us. It seems generally agreed that the new tariff proposals will not greatly affect our trade with the United State;. Ixndcn News. In the references to Brazil and Bering sea. in President Cleveland's message, there is nothing that might not have been fathered by President Harrison. It is otherwise with the reference to Hawaii. In awaiting Mr. Cleveland's decision the frictions that would probably have been caused there by interference at the time, hu3 ben avoined, but the result is the .same. While the President will have the goud wishes of every sound c-conomist in the tariff-reform battle he has begun, it would be premature to regard It as already won because the biggest battalions are at' present on his side. London Chronicle. President Cleveland stood like a rock. No world could be clearer and no attitude cculd be Founder from an American stmd Iint The President and his Cabinet have chosen a battle ground with remarkable shrewdness. In our opinion they will carry the new tariff measure with less difficulty than they did th-s repeal of the silver pur chasing clause of the Sherman act. From our view, and In spite of Mr. Cleveland's frank attitude towards England, we might also regard the proposed new tariff, as the work of an enemy. Its natural conse quence Is to create a new competitor for our business abroad, and we can only hope that the benefit of cheap raw materials may lead to better things in other direc tions. London Standard. The message exhibits clear and well de fined views of policy in addition to much lorce of character. Mr. Cleveland does not take refuge, as so many of his predeces sors have done, in timid temporizing and ambiguities. The portions of the message bearing upon foreign affairs are conceived in highly creditable spirit Considering the chauvinism of our American kinsfolk, it is the more creditable that the President has frankly admitted the Tong done to Ha waii. Mr. Cleveland would doubtless be inclined to go a deal further than the Wil son bill, but he recognizes that the obsta cle to progress, caused by a deficit In the Wilscn bill, would benefit American work ingmen and place manufacturers upon some thing like a level with thJr foreign com petitors. Whether these changes In the long run will benefit British industry and trade is doubtful. London Times.
