CONTROVERSY to JÜ'I <KH! RE WITH SPAIN VIEWED. „«viewing the controversy which led Ä war with Spain, the president cm rathe thread or narrative where ,,k f 2 Lated in his last annual mes « """hT included: "It was honest y - - .« «If friendly relations with Spain * !w Ve should be given a reasonable ' a realize her expectations of re 'SîTto she had become irrevoca TvS^'evIdent, however that the "Xi Diana were barren of good re Srfo tangible relief was afforded the KoentradoS, among whom the rate ^ mortality frightfully Increased; the urolfere .1 expedient ot zones of cultlva £ prored illusory, and it was apparent that nothing save the physical exhaus tJm of Spain or the Cubans and the prac tail ruin of the Island of Cuba could re in t from the struggle then In progress. ' 

PESTRI'CTION OF THE MAINE. At this critical juncture the destruc tion of the battleship "Maine- occurred. Concerning It the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise tnd sturdy good sense c..siingulshing our national character that this shockin* blow falling upon a generous people, al mdv deeply touched oy preceding events In Cuba, did not move them to an in stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition ol danger and disorder at our door* that Wade j)ossible such a deed, by whomso ever wrought.'' Resuming the war narrative, the presi dent directs attention to the measures, including the $80,000,000 appropriation for rational defense, taken to place the country on a war footing, and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war. when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict." 

APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN POWERS. Reference Is made to the apprehension of coming strife by the continental pow ers, voiced in the address to the presi dent through their ambassadors and en voys, and to the president's reply ßtftl tmiraated, however, by tne 1 »aF that thereto, hope of * peaceful solution of the difficulty, and obeying the dictates of duty, tne presi dent relaxed no effort to bring about a •peedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne gotiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical results were concerned, and then it was the president presented the question to con gress. saying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered Amoriean interests, which give us the right and duty to speak arid to act. the war ln Cuba must stop." THE 

DECLARATION OF CONGRESS. The result of this statement of the case was tne adoption of the memorable joint resolution by congress, declaring the pur of Jj) e United States to intervene Spaniards and Cuban.

PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS In Ihls connection the president savs "Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve ments of our builders, mechanics and ar tisans for their part In the construction ot our warships." TEARS FOR THE DEAD. As to the success gained by the arms of the United States In Cuba, the presi dent says that the earnest and lastl'mr gratitude of the nation Is unsparing v due. "Nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living, the dead claim our tears, and our losses by battto anl disease must cloud any exultation at the result, and teach us tbs awful cost of war however, rightful the cause or signal the

TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT GO. The president bears testimony and pavs fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de vqt.lon of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered the post of greatest exposure, fortunate ly were not required outside of the United Stales. ' They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The president then says: "In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment, and offers humble prayer for the continuance of His fuvors. THE

GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS SESSIONS. "I do no*, discuss at this time the gov ernment ot* tenure of the new possesions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, ami until the congress has legislated other wise. it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation, and to give to the people security in life and propertv and encouragement under a Just and benefi cent rule. THE FUTURE OF CUBA. "As soon as we are ln possession of Cuba and have pacified the Inland it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for them selves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is im portant that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in re ry proper way to build up the waste places of the iBland, encourage the industry of the people, and assist them to form government which shall be free ana in dependent., thus realizing the best aspira tions of the Cuban people. .1 A HUMANE GOVERNMENT. "Spanish rule must be replaced by a Just, benevolent and humane govern ment, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and which ehati encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and p mote peace and gooa wul among all inhabitants, whatever may have their relations in the past, venge nor passion should the new government, complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued." FRIENDLY WITH ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. The president says that with one ex-' ception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations during the past year has been marked with cordiali ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar gentine government, initiated with a view to removing differences in cabie rate charges imposed upon messages passing from and to the United States, the presi dent expresses his sincere hope for ternational agreement . whereby inter change of messages over connecting lines may be regulated on a fair basis of uni formity, and adds: "It would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which owes so much of Us progress to the nihilation of time by the electrical force, demands that this all-important means of communication be pies, to be administered and regulated in their common behalf." ro ot the been Neither re have a place in Until there is in heritage of nil pen A 

QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUN GARY. to the killing ami wounding of strik ing miners In Luzerne county, Pa., which aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun garian government, many of the miners being subjects of that government, the president expects to reach u haruonlous understanding on the subject with Au stria-Hungary. The hope Is expressed that the restric tions Imposed by Belgium on the Impor tation of American cattle will at an early day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer ican cattle under proper regulations. THE 

NICARAGUA CANAL. The president expects that the Nicara gua canal commission will shortly be able to report finally. "I have not hesitated to express my convictions," says the pres ident, "that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an inter oceanic canal by tilts route require the maintenance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States conjress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter." . , The president regards, in view of our newlv-ucquired Intorests ill the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a mari time highway as now nitire tnan ever in dispensable. 

EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Concerning the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese empire, the president says that our position among nations gives the equitable claim to con sideration and friendly treatment In tills ard, nnd that it will bo his aim to subserve our large Interests in the «'lent bv all means appropriate to th e constant policv of our government. Reference is made to several claims of citizens of the United States pending against other nations and to the settle of other claims during the past As a - § i. ment year. THE

Matters that Will Not buffer by » Little Delay—Tlie American Cl Are Haid to be fiaitml lo Their Cuuclu Washington, Dec. 5.—The impres sion prevails here that the results of the negotiations at Pans will be em bodied in two or more treaties, in stead of one. There will be one actual peace treaty, embodying nothin}; more than the protocol points relating to Spanish West Indies, Guahatn and the Philippines, with the single excep tion of the proviso for the release of prisoners. Other Matters Can Wait All the others matters, those relat ing to the renewal of the commercial treaties, the acquisition of cable and coaling stations and, in fact, all thdfee extraneous matters that have been mentioned as likely to he incorpo rated in the peace treaty will form tlie subject of a special treaty. This course is likely to be adopted iu order to hasten the conclusion of peace, for which there is a great necessity, if for no olher reason than to secure the release of prisoners and the restora tion of trade between Spain and the United States. N« Friction Amon» tlie American«. There has been no evidence of any friction between the American com missioners. Tt is supposed, iu fact it is known, that in their own sessions they have differed about some points and have discussed these at length, but tion in Americans •hen it came to the point of ac the joint commission the ere united.

Washington, Doc. 5.—Congress reas sembled under circumstances of un usual public interest. The same congress, six months ago, de clared war against Spçiin and now, with the war fought îfnd won, it came together again for the first leg islative consideration of the ques developed by the eventful The spirit of the tions months just past, occasion was not, however, one of im mediate expectancy, for the few tnontlis left to the existence of the Fifty-fifth congress give promise of little more than a beginning of the momentous polieies and problems growing out of the war. All Washington Turned Out. As usual nil Washington turned its attention to the capital for that gain event whicli marks the opening duy of a session. The weather imposed no barriers, for the hurricane of Sunday had given way to clearing skies and balmy air. Long before the noon hour, when the senate and house began their work, the corridors were filled with surging crowds, centering in the rotunda and statuary hall, and push ing toward the private galleries, evidences remained of the explosion and fire which recently ravaged the building. Ity 11 o'clock the. leaders began to make their appearance and the public galleries filled rapidly. Hfliml f. No In the opening hours of the lust ses sion of the memoable Fifty-fifth con gress tlie senate chamber presentet an animuted scene. The galleries were filled early, many of the specta tors being visitors to Washington who had embraced the opportunity to wit ness a congressional opening. On the senate floor the scene presented was unusually brilliant. The desks of the members were loaded with magnifi cent specimens of Ute florist's art. Nothing more beautiful or elaborate in floral displays ha« been seen in the senate for many years. Above in the diplomatic gallery.just before the senate convened, appeared .Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British am I bass»dor, and party; Mr. Wu Tin# Fang 1 , the Chinese minister, and at taches of his legation and some other members of the diplomatic corps. On the floor, Lord Her schell, the chief representative of Great Britain on the joint high e.ommiBsion, came •eom panied by Mr. T. Jefferson Coo litige of Massachusetts. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Richard Cartwright, Sir Louis Davies and Mr. Charlton, members of the commis sion, were also on the floor. Promptly on the stroke of 12 o'clock Vice-President Hobert en tered and ascending' to his desk, rapped for order. Mr. Milburn, the, venerable blind chaplain, in a profoundly impressive manner, returned "devout and rever ent thanks for God's goodness to us ns n nation, and for His care of since last gathered in this chamber." "By Thy good providence," the chap lain prayed,"triumph lias crowned our arms by land and sea; so that peace has eotne to us through the council chamber. Let Thy grace be the por tion of our people, and may their hearts he rendered in service to Thee and all men. We pray that Thy bless ing may be with the queen regent of Spain and her young son, and on her nation. May Thy heavenly grace come to secure and uplift anti uphold that stricken people. Grant that all good may be given to us, to our moth erland, and lo all nations, and may we walk hand in hand with our brethren across tlie sea to the heights of Chris tian civilizatitm." A call of the senate developed the presence of G7 members. The usual resolutions were offered and adopted. Mr. Cullom (111.) moved to appoint a committee to inform the house that the senate was ready to transact business: Mr. Hale (Me.).that fixing the hour of daily meeting at 12 o'clock, noon, and Mr. Morrill (Vt to appoint a committee to notify the president that the senate was awaiting any communication he might desire to make. ) Mr. Morrill (Vt.) and Mr. Cockrell 'ore named T>y the vice-presi (Mo.) dent to join a like committee of the house of representatives to call upon the president. Mr. McBride (Ore.) presented the credentials of His newly-elected col league. Mr. Simon, to whom the vice president administered the oath of of fice. Fending the receipt of the presi dent's message, the senate, on motion of Mr. Allison (111.), took u recess of 30 minutes. At 1:25 p. m. Vice-President Hobart laid the president's message before the senate, and its reading was begun at 1:28 p. m. House. Exactly at noon. Speaker Reed gavel came down with a sharp crack, the great ebony mace entwined with silver and surmounted by eagle, was lifted into place upon its green marble pedestal, the spreading folds of American flags were broken to tlie breeze about the brilliant r s a silver mSS ■tnnied glass editing, and the house of représentatif* 1 *! vnterd upon the clos of the memorable war con The scene within the great imuted, brflliunt and pic mg seston cress, hall was turesque. The sea of desks within the brasa ails which cut off the lobbies, spread in seuii-eireular lines from the speaker's rostrum like waves from a liter, were a veritable flower garden. A majority of members were in their place, while above tile encircling gal- . leries were bunked to the doom r ing ce dth people. At 11:45 the floor was cleared of all those not entitled to the privileges. The leaders, ns a rule, were late in ar riving, but as they appeared they were rrounded and cordially greeted. Mr. Hitt (HL), chairman of the com mittee on foreign affairs; Mr. Dalzeli (Pa.), one of the members of the com mittee on rules; Mr. Henderson (la.), of the same committee, were each giv en an ovation. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the majority, and Mr. Dailey, the minority leader, came in simultaneously from the lobbies of their respective sides. Mr. Bailey went immediately to his seat, and Mr. Dingley, as soon as he could disengage himself from friends who crowded around him, crossed over to the democratic side and shook hands with his political adversary. As the hands of the clock pointed to noon, the giant form of the speaker pushed through the green baize, and Mr. Reed ascended the rostrum. A wave of ap plause swept floor and galleries upon his appearance. A light smile played over his benign features ns he raised his gavel aloft. When it fell with re sounding whack, a hush fell upon the vast assemblage. "The chaplain will offer prayer," announced the speaker in low tones. Heads were bowed reverently as the chaplain, in eloquent words, invoked the divine blessing, giving praise for the victory that had attended our arms, and the peace which had come, and asking for strength and wisdom to meet the new problenms which con fronted the nation. At the conclusion of the chaplain's prayer, the speaker announced that the first business in order would be a call of the roll to determine the pres ence of a quorum. While the responses were being made, Gen. Wheeler, of Alabama, came in and took his seat in the row immediately in front of the speaker's rostrum. He was instantly surrounded by half a hundred members, and received the ovation of the day. The roll call developed the presence of 267 meber, 179 being a quorum. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader, of fered the customary resolution for the appointment of a committee of three to join a similar committee of the sen ate to wait upon the president and in form hirn that the house was ready to receive any communication he had to make. It was unanimously adopted, and the speaker appointed Mr. Ding ley, Mr. Cannon and Mr. Bailey. A res olution was also adopted instructing the clerk of the senate that the house was ready to proceed to business. The house then took a recess until 1:30, to await the arrival of the president's message.
