"A small group of International hankers and money lenders, public utility exploiters and tariff beneficiaries have actually dictated nominations for offices up to the Presidency. Thev have placed the slickest, cleverest and most cunning manipulators in official positions, even in the minor posts, where they could be of service when called upon by the invisible power which, utterly devoid of all humanity, seeks but to wallow In richea.

DOUG AND MARY TO TAKE WORLD TRIP Selected Group of Fifty to Accompany Movie Stars on Long Journey. McADOO MAY BE GUEST Chaplin and Pola Negri Will Make Cruise?Jap Ship Being Fitted Up In Fashion. Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford have begun preparations for the most unusual trip ever taken by any motion picture stars. They are planning, If nothing occurs to prevent, to make a trip around the world next spring. With them, as a possible honeymoon couple, will go Charlie Chaplin and Pola Negri. For this trip a steamer has been :hartered and Invitations have been sent to about fifty guests. The ship is said on good authority to be the Japanese steamer Persia Maru. rhis vessel belongs to the Toyo Kisen Kaisha, and has a net tonnage of 2,070. it is a single screw ship, the crack vessel of the line, carrying only first cabin passengers, numbering 80. It regularly piles between San Francisco and Yokohama, but on Its last trip. Instead of naking the return voyage to the Oolden 3ate, it was taken from service and sent to Kobe early last month for spe:ial refitting in preparation for the com- ; Ing trip. Notice is given on all the folders an- i nounclng the servioe of the Toyo Klsen Kalsha that thla steamer was with- j irawn after that date for the rest of the ' season. It will be fitted with a gymnasium, a swimming pool and a rnlnla- | ture movie theater. The trip Is estimated to cost around 1250.000, and it will last from six to eight 1 months. Its purpose will be threefold, it will be, for one thing, a publicity itunt. as Doug and Mary discovered that their recent trips to Europe Increased their popularity enormously by bringing them in personal contact with their ad- ! mirers. Secondly, it will enable them both to satisfy their desire to travel. j Thirdly, they will be able to check up j on the work of their foreign representa- , Ives and distribution agencies, especially ; In Japan and the Orient, where their 1 releasing bureaus are only newly established. They will leave San Francisco next spring. Despite the large cost of the trip It is rx pec ted to be more than made up by the publicity and the fact that they will take camera men along and' shoot pictures, as well as animals, en route. Moreover, they have the largest capital jehlnd them of any Independent stars, aelng backed by a group of wealthy Cleveland real estate operators and the Doheny oil Interests. It Is possible that William O. McAdoo, . (x-Secretary of the Treasury and how reneral counsel to United Artists, the 1 Fairbanks-Plckford company, will ac- i sompany them part the way. William S. Hart, the motion picture ictor, sent a letter to Thi New York Gerald last night denying the report hat his work for Paramount pictures >robably would end when his present :ontract expires. He wrote: "The statenent In to-day's Herald that I am conemplating ending my affiliation with famous Players-Lasky Co. Is not true. ,Vhen I work again It will be under the j Paramount banner."

AFTER 'HIPPERS' ALSO1 Records, of City Arrests to Be Used by Federal Men in Crusade. MAY SEIZE TROUSERS I Fight to Be Concentrated in 'Roaring Forties' and on $30,000,000 Ships. A new phu? of prohibition enforcement will go Into effect this week. BJ. C, Tellowley, Federal Enforcement Director, s&ld yesterday that Police Commissioner Enrlght has Instructed his department to give unstinted support to dry agents In a campagn to curtail the sale of alcoholic beverages In cafes, cabarets and saloons In the "Roaring Forties." Commissioner Enrlght has agreed. Mr. Tellowley said, to furnish to the prohibition enforcement department a complete tfally report of every alleged violation of the Mullan-Gage law, the State enforcement measure. Through evldenco- furnished In the Police Department reports the Federal enforcement officers will be abfc, Mr. Yellowley said, to bring Into extensive use that provision of the Volstead act which provides authority for closing, through Injunctions proceedings, every establishment that twice violates the national prohibition act. "The Injunction feature of the law Is our best "bet," said the dry director. "We Intend to put a halt to the sale of liquor through Its use. There are pending at this time more than 1,300 such Injunction suits, and we hope to get early hearings on them. By putting out or business all places that show utter disregard for the prohibition law we will bring about enforcement of that measure. Gotna After "Hlppers" Too, "We are going after the hip pocket 'toters,' too. There is no bluffing now, because the police are fighting with us. . One night very soon we will drop in unexpectedly on some of the midnight 1 gatherings where liquor is flowing freely. Broadway's palaces of midnight revels are going to dry up." The campaign to close by injunction all places that twice violate the Volstead law Is tho most drastic step so far taken by the Federal Government In its fight to stop the sale of liquor. | Admittedly unable to stop the great flow of liquor from the Bahamas, tho enforcement department has taken this new stand as a means for making :t almost Impossible for the wholesale whisky syndicates to dispose of the huge shipments of liquor aboard vessels of the "whisky armada" now standing oil the New York and New Jersey coast. With 300,000 cases of wet goods, with a retail value of $30,000,000, scheduled to be landed here before Christmas Immediate drastic action was necessary, Mr. Yellowloy admitted. The prohibition navy has an Insufficient number of vessels to successfully combat the activities of the "liquor- flotilla." but! through conducting a rigid warfare j against the retail sale of liquor the enforcement officials hope to give the whisky smugglers something to worry about. May Cosilarste Trousers. The MUllan-Oage law is a necessary adjunct to the Volstead law. according to Palmer Canfleld, legal adviser to Mr. Yellowley. Its repeal, he said, would bo a disastrous blow to proper enforcement of prohibition, Inasmuch as police offteers no longer would he obligated to make arrests In liquor violation cases. "The Mullan-Gnge law." said Mr. Can- ; field,, "gives us tho basis for police cooperation. Its repeal would he like cut- ! ting of the arms of a man who works entirely with his hands. With unstinted police cooperation p-omlsed us the New York enforcement department stands to-day nearer to victory than at anv other time since enactment of the Volstead law.". The trousers of "hip flask totlnir" habitues of Broadway*n palaceia of midnight revels, Mr. Canfteld pointed out, are In danger of being shorn from the limbs they hide. The national prohibition act, he asserted, provides authority for dry agents to seise any vehicle, article or receptacle In which alcoholic beverages are Illegally transported. 'This provision Is going to be rigidly applied," he added, with a twinkle In his eye. "It may be necessary for us to confiscate some trousers."

Morris of the Republican State Committee of New York, demanding that the Republican party in New York break away from reactionary control in favor of a series of popular reforms. The letter Is being drafted by Representatives Luther Mott and Hamil ton Fish, Jr., and la expected to be signed by seventeen of the thirtythree Republicans in Congress from New York State. The text will he made public when the letter Is ready to be sent, probably Wednesday or Thursday of next week. The letter will propose a conference between Republican members of Congress. Republican members of tho Strte legislature and county chairmen and State committeemen of New York for the purpose of agreeing on a program of legislative reforms. It will say these reforms should be supported even If they are advocated by A1 Smith as Governor. The New York State Legislature, Representatives Mott and Fish explained to day, will be called upon to support the restoration of Statewide direct primaries, the reorganization of the New York Stat# government and home rule measures with reference to the transit situation. Both Mr. Mott and Mr. Fish declared | they believed such a move necessary for the sake of harmony and the success of the Republican party in New York State. "The younger element in the party will not follow or oven remain In the Republican party If the old reactionary leadens and policies are to dominate," they said In a Joint statement announcing the drafting of the letter. ' Some of the party leaders are under the suspicion of being controlled by the corporations and this influence must be wiped out before the party can regain the faith of the voters. The Republican party In New York appears to have lost contact with the people and every effort must be made to show Its good faith by supporting progressive legislation at Albany and Washington." In making the announcement both Mr. Mott and Mr. Fish took pains to say they are not seeking political preferment by the step they have taken and that they are not for or against any Individual In the situation.

Lacsannb, Deo. 9.?The optimistic feeling that prevailed yesterday over the Turks' conciliatory attitude and their split from the Russians was charged entirely to-day, owing to the fact that the Turks this afternoon, in negotiations with allied experts, showed a new firmness on several points. Chief of these was the matter of capitulations. The Turks announced they would allow no one to obtain any advantages of Turkey in this respect, one expert adding: "If anybody is to get advantages it will be the Turks." The military clauses on the rule of the straits provoked dissensions, the Turkish exports declaring that Turkey would permit no limitation of armament. Concerning the military clauses Ismet, Faaha said to-night: "The Sevres| treaty had six pages of such provisions, not one of which lias the force of law. j for they have never been agreed to." j Ills delegation also objected to clauses regarding the number of ships to be al- | lowed ir. the Black Sea, declaring they had not understood what they meant when proposed by Lord Curzon yester- J day. They defined Che Turkish position as unalterably against any limitation i of armaments.

Soviet Foreign Commissar, receiving the Turkish newspaper men to-night, said he was very sorry to see the stand taken by the Turks, but at the same time he could see no reason why the good relations that existed between Russia and Turkey should not continue. He warned Turkey to beware of the Allies In the Black Sea. The American statement still is exciting much attention here, especially In silled quarters. A member of the British delegation to-night expressed the ' British attitude as welcoming any Amer- , lean principles at thin time. Although the fate of the conference still Is subject to many surprises It Is ' not expected that It will adjourn over :he holidays. The British consider that ! t would be regrettable to let the Turks 1 return to Angora while in a conciliatory mood and then return to Lausanne un- I Jer the Russian yoke.

Tchltcherln did not want to censure the Turkish plenipotentiaries, but thought the Turkish people at home I should know of things at Lausanne. He lad a distinct Impression, he said, that war between' Turkey and the Powers j was still going on.

After- i ward the great Powers would defeat i : Turkey and Russia separately. M. Tchltcherln charged that France had abandoned Turkey in favor of Eng. 1 land, and the consideration was nroh- . tbly some concessions on the repara- ' lions problem from Kngland. "But If remains to he seen," he continued, "how far France and Kngland will npre? when the Brussels conference Is held."
