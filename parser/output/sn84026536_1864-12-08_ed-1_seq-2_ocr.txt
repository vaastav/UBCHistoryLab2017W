THE WILMINGTON JOURNAL. WTr.vmflTTTHUBSDAY, DEC. 8, 1864. Theks ia something strangely inconsistent and-indeed contradictory in the Yankee accounts of affairs in Tennessee. First it is asserted that Ho 3D w;s repulsed at Franklin, twenty, miles from Nashville, and retreated with heavy loss. We cannot eee, however, how thia can be reconciled with the other despatches eaying that (subsequent to tha supposed retreat, he was bo near. Nashville that the rattle 0 musketry was heard in the streets of that city. Bat i-daed we ought not to complain of the meagre nes3 cr coctrad;ctory character of our Not them advices from Hood. They are at least as full aa our Southern advices from Sheem. The newspaper men are cer tainly the most devoted and self eacrifi-nrg of patriots, Voluntarily or involuntarily, they have been subsisting for weeks past without any pabulum, to their manifest loss. They have no news. They can tell nothing about Sheemak cr any other man. Their aaio inter est is eusp-.nded, and with it their sale is necessarily diminished, for who cares to buy papas that' have no Dews? The Pkessube is daily becoming more and more Revpre fin the newsnarers. Such ia the state of the rc&ila, that the soldiers in camp can take lew papers and can hardly get the" few that they try to take. The homg community i3 diminished by many causes and at the came time the area from which news can be gathered is rapidly contrpcted by raid3 and reticence It will soon t3 contraband to publish the state of the weather. Verily, our enfLrings is intolerable. It ia hard scuffling under the best of circumstances ; it ia the very deuce now. Nothing but perseverance, good luck, frugal habits' end a clear conscitcc3 can carry us through the winter. So we have cur own private wrongs to avenge on Mr. Siiekma;!. lie has done us much harm, and the Eoocer Aw hash 13 settled, the better we will be pleased, lie is a bid uj m under any circumstances particular ly bo under the present. Th3 position of things is an omafons. The very seasons are out of joint. At li ft, ra., Dec. Gib, the thermometer is at 70. It will be 15 in the course cf ti e day. " We will tax for ibis weather before Christmas," EaiJ a ftiind to us yesLerday. It id indued seldom that we CEcap; muddy and unpleasant weatLcr about Christ mas, or New Year, at the farthest. But wiecd many human lives have already paid for this weather by the protection cf a campaign, the bloodiest in the book of tice. There probably never was wct! er in November and December so suitable, for carrying cn the very humane operation of mutual destruction. Nothing steps operation at Richmond Suebman's movements are not impeded by the season in Georgia ; the campaign in Tennessee and Kentucky eeems to t.ke a frteh start. Surely Grant has had every chance to try the tfiect or h'13 favorite f-ystern cf attrition of wearicg out the Confederate armies by constant coJIisicn with the superior numerical force of fbe Un.-ted StatC3. From May to December the stern wrestle of death has gone on, and not once has the iron etrahi of the sturdy athle'ic been relaxed, or their mu tual hold released for tha briefest breathing spell. "Will there really be any 6uch thing &3 a ciose of th's campaign? Any intermission of the deadly struggle any dropping ci tne curtaia upon me scene ot car nage ? . I'kcbably there is no chapter in warfare meaner or . mere disgraceful than that contributed by the conduct of the United States in the case of the Confederate cruiser Florida, treacherously surprised and captured while quietly crjojiEg the supposed sanctity of a eeu tral port That vvaa bsd enough but the final was worse. Feeling ensured that tLe powers "cf Europe, at least the maritime powers of Western Europe, would not quietly wink at such a violation of iaternational rights, even although a weak power like Brazil wa3 the victim and that, as a consequence restitution and apology might become necessary and unavoidable, the first of these is evaded by rendering it3 actual execution impos sible. The Fldrida, lying ia Ilarcptoa Roads, was cc. cidenially run into by an army steamer and suuk. "We think that if the Wachnsett cannot restore the Flor ida she should pive herself up in her stead.

Noruisa later from Shekman. Oa Friday mornins his main holy b.-oke up its carcp at Louisville, Ga., and marched down the Central Railroad, ia the direc tion of rfavannab, passing through Minen bafore night, fail, his left wing, consisting of the fourteenth and twentieth army corps, being in advance. The recent halts tf Shebmax are ascertained to have been for the purpose of grinding corn. A3 he tends towards the barren counties cf tbe South, it became necessary to make the proper provision. IH3 foraging- parties are constantly driven ia by our cavalry and compel.ed to hug the main body, h is ft rage is reported to be short Tn Yellow Fves is Bermuda The Bermuda Thk flurrt occasioned by ome propositions in President Davis' message has mainly passed away, and these propositions may now be discussed coolly aid without any aspersion of his motives, a jd equally with out liability cf baring the motive ot those differing from him suspected cr misunderstood by any one whose opinion could weigh anything in the scale. .The matter of the f'eedom of the press, supposed to be attacked by the President's recommendation to abol ish all exemptions of classes, and, placing all, at once, in the army, create a new status for the conductors or publishers of newspapers that of detailed men baa perhaps been discuesed with too much vehemence, so far, at least, as the assignment of unworthy motives ia concerned. We have seen nothing in the course of President Davis that would lead ua to suppose Jhat the object he had or has in view was or is an attack upon the freedom of the press. His object undoubtedly was to bring men into the service, and still more, to increase the efficiency of the army by removing causes of com plaint existing among the troops, arising out of abuses incident or supposed to be incident to the system of ex emotions bv classes. TLe reasonings bv which the W President sustained his recommendation or proposition have already been discussed, and need not now be re- w ferredjo at length, further than to repeat what was said oa a former occasion that the exemption extended to editors or printers has never been regarded, and never can be properly regarded, as a personal privilege. Tbe freedom cf the press, like tbe freedom of speech, is guar, anteed by tbe corstitutrm. But common sense will tecch us that the press the printed utterance of opin ion cannot exist impersonally tbat. without editors and printers there can ba no press that neither papers, books, pamphlets nor other publications can either write or print themselver. The perfect freedom of the press mu3t therefore mean tbe perfect freedom of those who conduct it ; and however great the public confidence may ba in President Davi3, however high may be the character of editors worthy to be such, we may fairly ask whether it is in accordance with human nature that men should feel perfectly free in discussing the acta or controverting the opinions of those in whose power it might be to close up their offices at any moment by withdrawing their own detail, cr the details of their em ployees? We base our calculations and reasonings upon the world as it exists. We live in no Utopia, and we do not think Jhe millennium has come. Tbe people generally would reason as we have reasoned. No matter how free the press might in effect be, would be so accredited 1 woald not people be apt to say that I whether abased or not, it ia liable to abuse ? But even suppoaibg the pess actually criticising with the utmost freedom the measures of .the government, would it feel equally frea to support and praise it ? Could it reallj lend an efficient moral support ? Would not its mo tives ba suspected ? We know that it has been hinted that the newspaper men make all this fuss because they fear that they may be put into service. That inch thiBgs should be sud is inevitable, and the modicum of apparent truth in them is one reason why we have sincerely deprecated the pas sionate and ill tempered utterances that we have seen too many of our cotemporaries indulge in. Silence gives consent, and silence on the part of tbe press would have been construed into acquiescence. It was right therefore that such conductors of the presa as dissented from the President's recommendation should express their dissent frcm that, as from any other recommenda tion of which their judgment could not approve. Hut in this case, of all others, the dissent expressed should have been that of the judgment, and sot couohed in such language as would subject them to the imputation of personal moXivcs. Another matter in the President's Message, namely in reference to engaging in a certain way the services o forty thousand negrcss as military workers, has, we think, given rise to more passionate animadversion than the occasion calls for, or the language of the Message would justify. The policy of acquiring for the public service the entire property in the labor of the slave, and holdiDg out to him the prospect of eventual emancipation as the reward of faithful ser vice, may admit of question : but we do not see wherein the principle cf State rights is infringed by any part qf the President's recommendation. The rights of private proprietors to surrender their proprie tory right in the labor of their slaves, and deport them to any point consistent with the status which they wished to confer upon them has never been denied. The granting of permission to reside here or in any other slaveh'oldicg State has always been reserved by the, States, and President Davis submits for the considera tion of Congress what action.should be taken to secure for the freedmau the permission of the State from which he was drawn to resida within its limits after the close of his public service. President Davi3 is no neophyte in political science he is no new convert to the doctrine of State Rights, and it will be d.ffiault for mere declaimers, who make their zeal ior State Rights the cloak for personal op position to fiad him really at fault. mngirg irea 111 iu uiwi uucs uumug ; s a mile atone, tod iULdry other such things have been generally classed together as labor in vain. We re gret to say that there are other things that are daily done, said and enacted, thai seem to ua equally deserv icg of uc5 clasaiflcitioa, arid among these we may cite the elaboration of. certain peace resolutions in nearly all the State Legislatures in the Confederacy. Some time since it was urged by the writers of semi-reconstruction letters, aad the offerers of peace resolutions that these were good to afect the pending elections at the North and to strengthen the peace party there. Well, tbe elections have come and gone without being affect d by anything coming from the South, and instead cf the peace party being strengthened, it tamed oat that there was no peace party. McClillajt was in effect the same ea Likoclx. Tbe whole thing is certainly a dead horse, ard we cannot but wonder whether those who keep up singing psalms to him, expect the taid defucct animal to burst out in a horse laugh at their greenness or their hypocrisy. It is about ai much in piace n jw as Mr. Foctb'b resolution iu Congress in favor of the Monroe doctrine. But then what is the use in having a bobby unless you can ride it T What advantage are principles unless you can parade or twist them for tbe purpose of ma king political capital T These be the questions to which present practices give rise. Why shonlda't Mr. Pool for instance, cf er his resolutions in the North Carolina Legislature, although he knows tbat tbeycan only .do harm? May they not do something for Mr. Poole? And so on with Mr. J. T. Lkach and other gentlemen, minor lights, all of them? Why shouldn't they all sing psalms to their dead hobby-horses to prove the great ness f tbe riders ? Why not indeed ? Gee up I In one thing Shesxan would seem to bnve cherished false hopes, and thus provided for himself a plentiful stora cf disappointment. His proposal to Governor Baowjt and Vice President Stephens, made during tbe Summer or Fall, shows that be flattered himself that Georgia was like a ripe peach, ready to fall into the hands of the Lincoln government, and that Gen. Sher man was the very person destined to gather the tempt ing fruit. He thought be had only to show himself in force and the people of tbe S tate would at once flock to the banner cf the Union, and place themselves under his protection. By' this time be is probably undeceived. His hopes h&ve vanished into tbe thinest of thin air. lie must bave entertained some notions of such assistance, recognition and countenance from the peo ple, eke why should he have fixed his rate of march at only fifteen miles per day, certainly a remarkable rate for a flying column. ' Sherman is not -the first person who has met with disappointment, and may not ba tbe last. His action in desolating upper Georgia and burning Atlanta makes bin appear like a very strange ambassador of peace a very surprising person indeed to hope to win Southern people by the blandishments of fire and swerd, and ra pine, and outrage and robbery 1 and yet after all he only represents the sentiment and course of action of those whom he serves. Gbant is as truculent as Shek man, Stanton, as truculent as Gbant, and " Old Abe as truculent as all of them put together, and Abe has just been endorsed by tbe Yankee nation. Subjugation or extermination form the motto of the dominant party at the North. . We glean some items from the latest Georgia pa pers : The Augusta Chxmitle and Sentinel, of Sunday, says that from advices received in that city, on Saturday, it is thonght that Shebman is below Millen with the main body of his forces. The enemy, in their recent march, destroyed every thing upon Gen. Cobb's plantation with the exception of his negro cabins. Macon is considered safe. The commandant of the post has declared the city upon a peace footing, and the order of Major General Cobb, ordering out every man capable of bearing arms, is withdrawn. The Georgia Central Railroad is being rapidly repaired. Refugees from tha line of the Macon and Atlanta Road are re turning and many parties are seeking their former homes in Atlanta. The scene of devastation in that city is too awful to contemplate. Soon after the Yankees left It, the country people in ita vicinity rushed in and car ried eff everything they could get hold of. Sherman will seek to avoid a battle, and above all a Beige, for he cannot afford to expend ammunition. The

Aiilitia and guard for home defence. The Guard for Heme Defence throughout the State br s been f-mployed in apprehending deserters and re turning them to tbe army, and in aiding the civil au thorities in preserving order. Ia the last four months they have returned to the army 1289 det-Trters and re cusant Conscripts, 421 of wacm have been apprehend ed and the rest surrendered themselves under your pro- clara.itioa cf the 24'h of August lat. In addition to these duties the Guard west of the Blue Ridge have been kept almost constantly in the field to rer.il invasion from Eist Tennessee, and to op erate against disloyal citizens who have gone over to the er.emy. With the view of keeping in the field as many oftfiis class cf troops as might be mcessiry and at the ima time to interfere as little as possible with the industrial pursuits of the country, they have been divided into three cljsses, each to setvo iu succession, aid for short periods ot tini3. The Guard in ccrtata coantuH h.ave h:-'n d-fenated fur seivice cn the western frontier, and h03d of the re gaining counties for vervicc- ia tho eas'ern part of the State. The first class of these latter have about com pleted their fi s' period of thirty days' service aid ere now being relieved by tha second class. It seems itnpossib'e to obtain c rrect return-? cf the Guard for Home Defence, but it ia believed that the of ficers are in proportioa to the cficciiva men as four to fifteen. This disparity arises from the great reduction of the members originally enrolled occasioned by the law of Congress of February last, which takes out ill above the age tf forty hve years, and decreases the number of exemptions from service in the Confederate array. It thereore becon es ne?easary to re-orgniza this force or what would be better, to repeal the law of the or ganization, and to organiz3 a force for fkll service, to be composed of ail ofhcais and others of the militia physically fit fcr such eervice. This force to be organ ized into companies, battalions, regiments, brigades and uiviaiuua, uuu uie cummigaions or me cmcers to De in Force only when called into the fieldat all otber times the organization to be mored iuto tbe regular militia where tbe cfSjers and men mu3t serve with their militia rank. This would necessitate the suspension of the commissions of militia officers while serving in this new urganiziuon, bhould the Guard for Home Defenc2 be abolished and another organization substituted, time should be given for the change to the end that the public service do rot sutler thereby. There are in the State 2650 militia officers, and 1312 Home Guard ocers. Many of these hold commissions in both organizations. 3. roll of noxos.

Vance, a copious synopii of which we publish to day, although, in some things, a little querulous, will commend itself to the puoiic ap proval, by the general wisdom ot its suggestions ana tne purity of its patriotism. We are glad to chronicle euch utterances from the Executive of tbe sister State which lies beside us, and with whose fortunes, those of Virgin ia are intimately and forever associated and blended. There is one of its topics c n which we deem it prop er to make a word of commcat. It formed a subj-ct of consideration in the Governors' Convention at Augusta and the ba9is of one of the resolutions there adopted. Gov. Vaoce's position, I ke that of Gov. Brown, is in harmony with tbe Augusta resolution. Congress is cal'ed npon to repeal the law under which tbe Confed erate Executive establishes "regulations" for the gov ernment of oar foreign commerce. Before Congress shall comply with this request, we hope it will give tbe subject a full consideration. It is not tbe first time tin proposition baa been mado ; aod, indeed, the last Congress so far acceded to it as to pass a la rr accordingly. But wheu it was returned to tbe House by the President, with the reasons which ren dered such a matur impolitic, the members were bo convinced by tbe exposition thui mad, that by a very large majority they sustained the veto, and assented to the law as it now stands. The veto npessage we have heretofore published, and its argumeuts have r-ever b:2n answered. We do not bebeve tbey cin be. Tin mil itary defence of the country is intimately involved in the question, and, therefore, it may not te decided without due deliberation. The " regulations " secure to tbe State authorities all the privileges tbcycoald reasonably dcire, while, but for trtera, we ebould tuva h-i ytaie ad (jonWeratc officers bidding aga nst eaca otht-r for vessels, and blockade rannere ecfciiitg ene"" from a ju3t and indispensable eervice to the Govern ment wbiaa defends tbe port of Wilmington ar.d keeps it open, by entering into more advaDtageoJ1? ecgig- mr.np with rflate officia 3.
