Congress.?A brief summary of Congressional items published elsewhere will be read with the highest inbirosi. The determined spirit manifested by Southern members is iruiy gratifying. Th.it the Union is <ibout t?> be dissolved scarcely admits of a doubt. The suggestions of Mr. Clingmsn, of North Carolina, are sensible and present an equitable and peaceable means of effecting the terms of separation > between the two sections. The Election.

The Presidents position upon the secession question,the on> Iv one iu which South Carolina is now partic ularly iuterested, tins been pretty correctly foreshadowed in the telegraphic despatches received from Washington before the Message was submitted to Congress. He denies that a Stute possesses the Constitutional right to secede and argues this at considerable length. He says : "This Government, is a great and powerful Government, invested with all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends. Its framers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds ot its own destruction, nor were they at its /creation guilty of the absurdity of providino for i(h own dissolution. It was not in. r?0 ' " "" "" tended by its frnmers to be the baseless fab-iic of a vision which, at the touch of the enchanter, would vanish into thin nir, but a substantial and mighty fabric capable of resisting the slow decny of time aud of defying the storms of nges. Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of thai day have indulged teara that a (government of such high powers might violaUt the reserved rights , of the States, and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these powers to prevent the danger! But they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imagine, that the Constitution would ever be so interpreted as to enable any State, by Iter own act, and without the consent of liei si-tor States, to discharge her people from all or any of their Federal obligations." But while he denies the right of a State to accede, he admits that tho people are not without redress against the tyranny and op pression of the Federal Government "The right of resistance 011 tho part of the gov 1 : , ,, J 1 uriiru nj^uiiisi me oppression 01 uieir gov ernmvnla cnnnot bo denied. It exists inde. pendenlly of nil constitutions, and has been exercised nt all periods of the world'* history. Under it old governments have been destroyed, nnd new ones have taken their place. Jl is embodied jn strong and express language* in our own Declaration of Indepeixiunce. ljut the distinction must ever ue observed,-thnt this is revolution against in established Government, and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inlersnt constitutional right. In short, let us ook the danger fairly in the face : Seces lion is neither more nor less than revolution. It mny or it may not be a justifiable 'evolution, bul'still it in revolution." He says that in the meantime, the Execuive is bound by solemn oath before God md his Country to see the laws properly ixecu'.eo. Hut adds : "What if the per fornance of this duty, in whole or in part, has >een rendered impracticable by ^vents over vhich be could have exercised no coutrol ? Such, fit the pregeol moment, in the case hroughout the Slulc of South Carolina, so ar as the laws of the'United States to neure the administration of justice by means >f the Federal Judiciary are concerned. All lie Federal officers within Us limits, through chose agency alone these laws can be curied into execution, have already resigned. iVe no longer have a l)bt/.et Juige, a I)isrict Attoruoy, or a Marshal, in South Caro iuu. In fact, the whole machinery cf the federal Government, necessary for tlie disributiou of remedial justice aiiu ng the penile, has been demolished ; and it would he litlicult. if not impossible, to replace it." In respect to the collection of customs, le says: "The sains insuperable obstacles io not lie in the way of executing the lnws for the collection of the customs. The 'ovenue still continues to be collected, as heretofore, at the custom-house in Charles* ton ; and should the Collector unfortunately i resign, a successor may ho sppointed to perform this duty." Then in regard to the Gov jrnnient property in South Carolina he says: ''J'hi* has been purchased for a fu'-r equiva lent,by the consent of the Legislature of the State," "for tho erection oi forts, mngnzlnsa, trsenala,'-' &.C., end over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation'' has been expressly grunted by tho Constitution to Congress. It is not beljeved that any at- | tempt will lye made to expel tho IJnitod States from this property by force; but if in this J should prove to be mistaken, the oHicer in command of thja forts bus received j orders to act strictly on the dt Tensive. In I such a contingency, the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants." | Tho President says that lie his no power | under the Constitution La coerce into sub* mission a seceding Jdtate. Ilo submit,* to Congress the whole question in ail ol its benrings, and intimates that the emergency may soon arise when that body will be called upon to decide the momentous question whether it poaaesaes tSo power, by force of arins, to compel a Stale to remain in the IT-:.... U. >.k? .c- -i < uiiiuii. cio Minrn ifiw |>?>?llinn UIBl l>Ull- j gress has no such power : lias the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into sub mission which is attempting to withdraw, or hiui actually withdrawn from the Corded >/?ey ? If answered in the affirmative, it inuat he on the principle that the power hae been conferred upon Congresa to deciire and to niaito war against a State.? Aftfer much d^.rfous reflection I have arrived at the cobcluslon that no ouch power has been delegated to Congress, or to any other department of JJ.fc Federal Government. It ia ruanifeat, upon an inspection ol the Conatitution, tfiat this Is not among the |>eciflc arid enumerated powers granted to Congress ; and it is equally apparent lhat its exercise is not "necessary arfd proper for carrying into execution," any one of the?e powers. Ho far from this power having been delegated to Congresa, it was expreaaly refused by the Convention ulijch framed Ihe Conatitution. Without descending to particulars it may >e safely asserted that lite power to make var against a State is at variance with the vhole spirit and intent of the Constitution, {oppose auch a war should result in the onquest of a Htute, how are we to govern t afterwards T Shall we hold it as a provace,and govern it by despotic power ' In he nature of (binge we could not, by physial force, control lha will of the people, ud compel theai to elect Senators and Hepsentatires to Congresa, and to perform I i all the other duties depending upon their own volition, and required from the free j citizens of 11 free ?Si?te ns :i constituent i member of the Confederacy. Hut if we possessed this power, would it ! be wise to exeieise it under existing oircum stances '? The object would doubtless be to preserve the Union. War would not only present the uiost effectual means of ' destroying it, bnt would banish all hope of; its peaceable reconstruction. Hosides, in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expended, rendering j future reconciliation between the States impossible. In the meantime, who can foretell what would bo the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence ? The fact is, that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be cemented by the blood of its citizens Bhed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affecljons of the people, it must one day perish. Con gress possess many means ot preserving it by conciliation, but the sword was not placed in their band to preserve it by force." Hut he solemnly invokes his country men to pause ami deliberate before they deter* initio to destroy this, the grandest Tempi? which litis ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began ; and insists that this ought to be the last desperate rem ?dy of a despairing people, after every other .constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted. He recommends that hefore the remedy of dissolution is resorted to, there be a Convention of the people of all tile Mtates to obtain an explanatory amendment of the Constitution on the subject of slaveiy ; and suggests that the amendment be confined to the final settle* merit of tLe true construction of the Constitution on three special points ; 1. All express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the States whvrc it now exists or may hereafter exist. 2. Tli? duty of protecting this right in ull the common Territories throughout their territorial existence, mid until they | shall be admitted as State* into the Union, with or without slavery, jia their coiistitulions may jircscribe. X. A like recognition of the master to have his ala\e, who lias escajiod from one j State to another, restored and "delivered I uto him, and of the validity of the f'ugi ] live Slave law, enacted for this jrirjio.se. to- ! getlivr with a declaration that an Stale laws impairing or defeuling this light, are violations of the ('onstituiiyii. and nre cotisefluently null ai;d void. Tho above embraces the material points j in tho Message on the question of Secession and remedy tor the grievances of the South. The Pri ident, according to Mr. j Buchanan's views, has no power l" coerce 1 a Slate into Hubuiistuoii; neither has t'l.n- I gress the power, and if that bvdy should , attempt to rc-ciinct tlio l'\>ree Bill, jiassed | under the recommendations of (jeneral ' Jackson, lie would be compelled to veto it | He aecuis, however, to coiitein|dalu retain- | itig possession of lli** Forts nt Charleston j in any event, and In continue tlio collection i of customs for the support of the Federal | Government. The Officer in commando/, the Forts has instructions to act strictly on the defensive. This condition of things cannot be submitted to b) South Carolina. 1 The possession of these Forts aro essential to her well being as a separate Government and in the event sf secession she will bo bound to attempt to regain possession of them nt all hazards. It the secession move, niont a general one, we believe that U.e Government property in each of the seceding States will be ahnndoned ; otherwise there would ensue a general w ar, which it is evidently the policy and the purpose ol the Government to avoid, lint should South Carolina he the only State t*> feeedc (a contingency not likely to happen) the course of thr Federal Government in respect to her, wc believe will be such us is foreshadowed in ill" Message. I'poll iho whole tlie .Mcauge has materially diminished the probability of civil war. Congressional Proceedings. Washington, December 4. ?

' in the house there was a long debate on ihe .reference of the .Message, and a resolution ottered by .Mr. IJoteler, of Virginia, was tinully adopted This resolution relers that portion t f the .Message concerning so cession to a special Committee of one from each State. The Message otherwise was referred to the Committee of tlie Whole ou the State of the Union. Before the result, .Messrs. Singleton, of Mississippi, Jones, Hawkins and (inrtrell, of Cecrgia, and Clopton and i'ugh. of Alabama, refused to vole, givjng as r reason, the culls for Conventions in their States to >.el tie the Questions at issue. Mr. Miloa, of South farolinq, sai l hit Statu wan virtually out of the Union, and thu South Carolina Delegation, therefore, wouldmot vote. There were thirty-eightvotea (all Republicans) agaitiat Mr. Bolelur's resolution. The Rupublican Senatora repudiate all j the Compromise scheme*. 'i'iiuy are detoruiiiind to remain entirely quiescent on the crisis. The declaration of several members that their Stale* had virtually withdrawn from the Union, created a profound eenaation in j the House, which was crowded to overflowing. Even lending Republicans fully admit the danger that menaces the Union, while among itemncrata wt.o are solicitous for its continuance with the understanding tha, there shall be juat concessions by the North there ia little more than hope that the Gulf States will hold otf from imirrcdiute secea. eion. I have heard of only two (democratic Senators who think that this may he < averted. judge Douglas, in hi* speech the other night, said that he ahould enter the Senate without feelings of grievance and without Kasslon, fully determined to unite with ajl Iniou men in the effort for ita preservation. He adopted the recent speech of Alexander H.

Washington, December 5.?There was an exciting scene in the Set.ate to-day. Wo hud a war speech from that noted Abolitionist Hale. He waked up the Senators Wigfull, Brown and Iverson, who responded in patriotic and noble terms. The speech .of Senator Iverson ereated a great sensation, lie declared that live Slates at least wou'd go nut of liiu Union, even if all the Personal Liberty Bills were repealed. It matters not what Congress might oiler or do. Senator llale said that, I if secession was persisted in, war wnsinevI "table.
