The position of the army on the Potomac re mains without change, An orler has been just issued under dale of November 2,"., by General MeClellnn, directing that all officers and enlisted men of (lie voluuleer service now prisoners intho liunds of the < nemy, or reported as missing i.i ac tion, or that may hereafter be taken prisoners or reported miming in action, be transferred to skele ton regiments, to be formed by the Governors of the respective States, and to consist entirely of such missing officers and men. The vacancies thus occasioned iu the organized regivents will be filled by the Governors of the various Btates*kto which the regiments belong. The same order dis misses from the service Major Isaac L\ nde, of the Second infantry, for sui rendering Fort Fillmore, in New Mexico, tc the rebels, in July last, the forces of the latter being inferior to bis own. Major General Hulleck has issued an important order to his commanding officers in Missouri, directing them to arrest and hold in confinement every one found in arms against the government, or those who, in any way, give aid to the rebels ; and ordering that all persons found within the lines of the army, in disguise as loyal citizens, and giving information to the enemy, and all those taken from the ranks of the rebels in actual ser vice, shall not be treated as prisoners of war, but as spies, and shall be shot. He further orders that the Provost Marshals of St. Louis shall take in charge tl,e numbers of Union families who are crowding into that city ? having been plundered and driven from their homes by the rebels? and quarter them upon avowed secessionists, charging the expense of their board to them, on the gronnd that, although they have not themselves plundered aud driven forth these unfortunate people, they are giving aid and comfort to those who have done so. By way of Cairo we have intelligence of a re ported battle at Morristown, East Tennessee, on Sunday last, between the Union forces uuder Par son Brownlow and the rebels, in which the latter were totally routed. The story comes from the Memphis papers, a:id they admit that it wm a Union victory, Brownlow is said to have li.td a force of three thousand men, but the number of the rebels is not stated. From another Memphis paper we learn that the rebel General Rains had cut to pieces the Union forces of General Montgomery, and taken the Gen eral prisoner; also that Ben. McCulloch had com pletely surrounded General Sigel at Sedalia, put ting him in a very awkward position, between sur render and annihilation. Taking the same au thority for what it is worth, we have the fact stated that the rebel General Pricc was advancing on St. Louis ? having crossed the Gasconade river that the people were flocking to his standard, and that he would enter St. Louis with an army of sixty thousand men ! The Dublin Freeman's Journal, of the 20th No vember, reports the object of. Archbishop Hughes' visit to Europe thus: ? The Most Rev. Dr. Hughes, Archbishop of New York, was among the pas sengers on board the Africa, which arrived at Queenstown on Monday. His Grace will stay a short while in this country, in order to obtain a sufficient number of Catholic clergymen to afford a chaplain to each of the Unien regiments requir ing one. He will then proceed to Rome taobtain the necessary power to grant faculties to such chaplains, so that they can officiate in whatever dlocess the regiments to which they may be attached may happen to be. CONGRESS. In the Senate yesterday Mr. Rice, of Minnesota, asked and obtained leavo to record his vote in favor of the expulsion of the traitor Rreckinridge. Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, offered a resolutiou providing for the appointment of a select commit tee to inquire into the causcs of the disasters to our arms at Hull run and Ball's Bluff. An amend ment was offered to extend tho inquiry bo as to embrace the battles at Springfield, Wilson's cr k (Ad Lexington. TLo amendment was rejected, and tho subject was tf-.cn postponed. Mr. Crimea, of Iowa, moved to tako up the resolution lo investigate the cose of Colonel Miles, a division commander at tlio battle of Bull run. Mr. Crimes said that a court of inquiry had round that Colonel Miles was iatoxleatcd to a certain ex tent?enough to justify Colonol Richardson in op pl\ it'K epliheta-to him, hut not enough to remove ltiin from command. He wanted all the facts of the cfiho to go to the people. The motion was agreed to, hut no further action was taken on the subject. Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, introdac d l.i i bill lor cor (if eating the property and giving free '?om to the slaves of rebels. In a long spceh in support of the measure, which we give in full in our report of (ho proceedings, Mr. Trumbull reca- ! pitulaled the main points of tho bill. The bill was ordered to be printed and referred to tho Judiciary Committee. Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, g:ive , notice of nn amendment to the Fugitive Slave law. I i 'ihe Semite then went into executive session. In the Hoat?e the standing committees were i announced by the Speaker. The changes in tho committees since the last session are unimportant. Mr. Curley, of Ohio, ollbred a resolution, which whs adopted, directing tho Judiciary Committee to inquire as to whether u censorship over the tele graphic despatches of the press has been esta blished; if so, by whose authority, aud by whom if is controlled; also to report if such censorship has not been used to restrain wholcsomo political j critiofsin and discussion, while its professed object j lies been to withhold information relativo to military movements from tho enemy. Tho various topics of the President's Message were referred to ? he appropriate standing rommittces, except that part relating to the proposed seacoast and lake defences, which w as assigned lo a special committee. Mr. Blair's project of colonizing ne groes iu Central America was adopted in Commit tee of tho Whole, then rejected by the House, but subsequently referred to the Committee on Foreign A .fairs. Mr. Lovojoy introduced a bill repealing all laws requiring parses of negroes goinf north ward, to take cK'ect immediately. It was referred to tim Committee - n the District of Columbia. A bill providing for the appointment of commission er- to revise aud codily the general statutes of the United States was referred to the Judiciary Com mittee. Both housas adjourned till Monday. 

IITSCLLIANEOUS NEWS. The Cunard st".imer Africa, which left Liverpool on Saturday, the 2:;d, and Sunday, the 24th of November, is now almost duo at this port, with three days later news from Europe. It is proba M" that ihe Africa will bring highly important iu tei'igence, in the smtpe of advices reporting the I'r : Impressions produced in England by tho new3 of the boarding of the steamer Trent by Lieutenant Fairfax, of the San Jacinto, and the arrest of Messrs. Mason and Sli.lell oa board of that vessel, by the order of Captain Wilkes. This fact was an nounced in New York on the ICth of last month, about noon. In n few hours afterwards the steam ship City of New York and Borussia sailed for Liverpool and Southampton respectively, taking out the main points of the communication as they appeared in tho extra edition of the Herald. On tho '20th of November the Persia left this port for Que nstown and Liverpool, having ou board files and letters containing all the particulars. Al though the City of New York is a very fast vessel, we do not anticipate tha' she reached England be fore the 26th ultimo. She would not, consequently, hive delivered her news until after the Africa s illed; but, in our opinion, the British mnil steamer La l'lata, Ironi St. Thomas? to which vessel tho mails and remaining passengers of the Trent were transferred? bad anticipated her ki that duty by making Southampton on the 23d of November. It will be borne n mind that Mason and Slidell were taken offtliu I rent, in the Bermuda channel, on tho 8th of November. The steamer would, we think, make St. Thomas from that point on the Uth,' three days afterwards. Allowing her two days for tho transhipment of cargo, passengers and mails, | she would have left on tho 13th of Novomber,' which would make her day at Southampton t'ie 23d of h?3t month, the day before the departure of the Africa. Should this calculation prove correct, the Africa will bring us, as wc have s*id, the reflection of tho feeling prevalent in England immediately after wards. If the La Plata d J not reach Southamp ton on that day the Africa will not bring the intel ligence referred te. In snch event we shall receive it by the Kangaroo, which left Qucenstown on the 26th of November for New York. The despatches by the Kangaroo will be ample. They may reach us by telegraph from St. Johns, Newfoundland, to morrow (Saturday), after the vessel has passed Cape Itace. Wc would look pretty confidently fur the arrival of the Africa, as well as the receipt of the report of the Kangaroo, this day (Friday), were it not for the prevalence of tho'se heavy northwesterly winds and cross seas, which delayed the City of Baltimore so long, during the past seven days. Although the three French men-of-war, Pomonei Bellone and Catin.it (corvette), still remain in our waters, being anchored oil' the Battery in the North river, on the other hand we are totally de void of a British war flap. The Raccr (British), six cuns, commander Lyons, of which we gave full particulars in the HtKALDof the 25th ult., has now left Quarantine. Her particular visit here was to receive despatches for the British authorities in the South, with which she sailed last Monday. The following table shows the number of men now in the service of the government and bat tling lor the preservation of the Union, the integ* rity of the country and for the preservation of the old Stars and Stripes against sedition, treason, insurrection and rebellion. The figures are taken from the official reports:? V olunteers 640,637 Regulars 20,331 Seamen and marines 22,000 Totnl 682,971 It is said that the late ridiculous and begging proclamation of the rebel Gen. Price in Misssouri was written by a man named Tucker, formerly editor of the Missouri Stale Journal. This man Tucker was indicted in St. Louis for treason, and gave bonds to appear and take his trial. He after wards ran away, and left his friends to pay the amount of his surety. There is some fault finding in the West because Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris, of Indiana, is not assigned a command. General Morris was very successful in Western Virginia during his short campaign, but his whole force being three months men, whea their time expired they left the service, and General Morris was thus forced into retirement, where he has since remained. He is a graduate of West Point, aud has the reputation of being a very tine officer. Unless the rebel blockade of the Potomac river is made more effectual the government will entire ly disregard it. Transports with troops and stores pass regularly up and down at the rate of half a dozen a day. The hospitals in Washington, Georgetown aud Alexandria contained, on the 2yth ult., ten hun dred and eighty-three sick and wounded soldiers, of whom two hundred and seventy-six belong to New York State regiments. John Vanderzee, the member elect in the First district of Albany county to the New York Assem bly, died on the 4th inst. The Seventy-fifth regiment of New York State Volunteers, who were encamped on Governor's Island, were yesterday afternoon transferred in a barge to the steam- hip I'a'.tic, lying at the foot of Canal street. Sb>' jiubably sailed during last nil' lit for Port Royal. [ A rcfcu'.u.- uiieiiug of the Gcavul Coiumiitge of thr. Mozart organization was field last oven'ng at their heAdquarters. A full attendance waa present, and several resolutions rclutive to tlie past election for Mayor were unanimously adopted. The Chamber of Commerce held their regular monthly meeting yestorduy afternoon, and adopted a niemoriul asking for the Assay Office the pri vilrge of converting into national currency tho gold and silver dopositcd in tho Sub-Treasurer's ' i oTiuo in this city. The subject of the recent dc- | i privations on American commerce on the coa.^t ; of Kurope hIko occupied tho attention of tho i Clmmber. A lull report will be found elsewhere. In tho Board of Aldermen last evening the ordi nance from the Council) in.'.!, appropriating an addi tional Hum oi 00,000 for tho relief of families j of volunteers was adopted. The Mayor sent in a ! communication giving i he names of persona ami \ associations to whom licences for theatrical or equestrian performances have been granted, and stating that ali license feus have been paid into the treasury of the Society for the Reformation of Ju venile Delinquents. Considerable unimportant routine business was transacted, and the Board luljourncd till Monday next. The Hoard of Councilmen were in session last evening and disposed of a good ileal of routine buuinri i. The ordinance adopted by tho Board of Aldermen in favor of appropriating $500,000 for the relief of the families of the volunteers from the city of New York came up for concurrence, and occasioned a long debate; but it was finally adopted. As there were minor amendments made to the ordinance, it will have to be sent back to the Board of Aldermen for their action. The Board of Exciso will hold a special aession this day, on the call of Commissioner Ilaskett. It is understood that the question of the qui turn suits will be bronght up for consideration. The second day's sale of books at the parcel sale at Leavitt's yesterday passed off well, prices in several cases being higher. A larger number of bidders was present, who bought fairly. The principal feature of to-day's sale will be the in voice of handsome ambrotype copies of flne en gravings to be offered by C. Tuber <St Co., of New Bedford, and a few listo of stationery, &c. In the General Sessions yesterday James Palmer was tried and convicted of passing counterfeit bill < np :i the Columbia Four Corners Bank, and sentenced to imprisonment in the State prison for five years and four months. Henry Ilandley plead ed guilty to nn attempt at burglary, and wub sent to the penitentiary for six months. The schooner Hubert B. Smith has been seized by order of the Surveyor, under tho Confiscation art, two-sixteenths of the vessel being owued in Virginia. Tlie cotton market continued firm yesterday , and tlio previous day's advance was fully sustained, while tho sales footed up about 2 *500 a 3,000 bales, about 1 ,0<~0 of which worn tukou by spinners. Price* closed utiir on tho basis of 30c. por pound for middling upl.tads. The stock was becoming materially reduced, and ostimated by some well informed persons in tho trado not to exceed over 12,000 bales, and sorao persons reduced the est imaled amount of available cotton in this market as low as 10,000 bales. This, however, may be bolow the actua[ amo'int. The private arcounts received by the City of Baltimore Imparted more buoyancy to flour, which wai active, at an advance of 5c. a 10c. per bbl. Wheat was also active and firmer, and closed about lc. per bushel denrer for good shipping lots. Corn cponod firmer, but clmcd at rather easier rates. Good shipping lota of Western mixed opened at 63)?c. a 64)jc., but closed ut the inside figure. Pork was unchanged and sales mode rate. Sugars were quite steady, whiio Bales were con fined to 306 lihds. and 70 bags. Coffee was steady, with sales of 2,400 bags of Rio at 18>{c. a 17)ic. Freights were steady, with a fair amount of engagements. The Rebellion? Signs of an Impending Collapse. It would not bo surprising if this overtaxed rebellion in the South were Boon to fall with a crash into a mass of ruins, like a ricketty old building with its supporting walls under mined. The immediate conspirators who pre cipitated this rebellion upon Iho South a to the vagabond politicianb of thai section, and they have contrived to draw the bulk of the great slaveholding interest into their toils, under tho delusion that the only safety to their slaves is a Southern confederacy. They have be>n strengthened in this idea by the incessant hue and cry of their own newspapers that "the usurper Lincoln'' has entered into this war i'or the extermination of slavery, and our abolition organs have been doing all in their power to push the administration to this extremity. But what is the policy of President Lincoln, as set forth in his Message? His policy is to save the South with its institution of slavery, and not to destroy it. His policy Is simply to restore the revolted Stales to the Union, and with as little injury to their people and their domestic institutions as possible. This Message will got among those people, and, though South ern confederacy politicians and planters may have passed beyond the reach of reason, there are seven hundred thousand non slaveholding white men in tho South who will have a word to say on the subject. This class is doing the heavy work of this war for Jeff. Davis. Ills soldiers, throe or four to one, are from the non slaveholding Southern whites. Poorly fed. badly clothed, and paid in worthless shinplas ters, these soldiers, from all accounts, are already sick of the service of Davis and his con federates. The Southern "poor whites," as they are called, who are left at home, arc not much better off. Thousands of them, in fact, are at the door of starvation. Granted, then, that they are strongly attached to Southern institutions and Southern distinc tions between whites and blacks, we think it very probable that these "poor whites," when they get hold of President Lincoln's Message, will begin to think that this rebel lion is a miserable delusion, that the longer it is continued the worse it will be for them, and that the Union as it was would be a great blessing. They will be assisted very materially to these conclusions by the kingly ideas of Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, and by the late proceedings of the Virginia State Convention in favor of superseding popu lar rights and republican institutions in the South by a convenient elective oligarchy. South Carolina, under this sort of an oligarchy, has for thirty years past been under the control of half a dozen men; and we see the conse quences. South Carolina is the fountain head of this rebellion. Her Legislature is an oligarchy, and her people under it have become as submissive as the people of France to the edicts of Louis Napoleon. A few designing politicians have thus ruled the Palmetto State in getting reins of her Legislature in their hands; and after thirty years of this training her people, in the matter of this rebellion, may be pronounced incurable except by subjugation. But sl?e stands alone. Had her secession movements of last December been snuffed out by Mr. Bucha nan. we should have had no rebellion. Every other State in revolt was carried into her con spiracy by fraud, terrorism and usurpation of power, and in many instances as in Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee? against over whelming popular majorities. Let us bring South Carolina to the terms of a military occu pation, n;:d wo shall have taken olf the control - iln? head ol this hydra of secossion; the TTufnn element In nil the other rebellious StaW will ri?o to its own deliverance. Already we are informed of startling signs of mutiny iu New Orleans against the Intolerable despotism of Davis. No other city of any nation in modern times, without being besieged or packcd l>y uti onemy, has suffered as New Orleans is suffering (lie horrors of war. Where aro the hundreds of steamboats, and the thousands of ark. and barges, w hit h constantly plied between lier le\ t e and the abundant stores of provisions of the Northwest, bringing down by millions of tons those stores to her merchants, in exchange lor their ootlon, sugar, molasses and imported ponds '.' Whore are the fleels of ships, going and coming, which, down to April last, whitened tho cutlets of the Mississippi rivor t All gone. For months not a steamer, barge or flatboat from the Northwest has gone down, and not a sail from tho sea lias gone up to New Orleans. Thus literally reduced to starvation, can it be supposed that the thousands of loyal men of that city wlM submit to the tortures of this mon strous rebellion much longer? We are satisfied that there will be very little, if any, resistance to our advance upon the city, and satisfied, too> that, what with starvation and what with the despotic tendencies of the rebel leaders, this whole rebellion is on flie verge of a grand col lapse. 1'resident Lincoln's views in the Message upon the subject are intended as a shot between the wind and water of this projected Southern Con federate oligarchy. And we hope vory soon to hear that he has hit his murk, and routed up in the South a popular revolt against this rebel lion which will speedily bring it to tho ground* Reduction ov Government Exr*VDrreRES. ? At every session of Congress a proposition is made by some member who is desirous of obtaining a reputation for economy, looking to a reduc tion of the civil expenditures of the government. Uut it never amounts to more than the intro duction or the reporting of a bill, and its being then printed aud referred to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union ? n tomb from which the clianoes of resurrection are ol the flimsiest. In this or in some other way the j responsibility of voting on the proposition is evaded, and every member can therefore con tinue to proclaim his great desire to cut down the expenditures. Already one of those inevi table propositions has beon introduced by Mr. Frederick A. Conkling, of this State, and is now before the Committee of Ways and Means. Mr. Conkling proposes the following retrench ments : ? 1. A redaction of twontv-five per cent on all salaries, civil, naval and military, amounting to $10,000 a year or over, including emolu ments. 2. A similar reduction of twenty per cent where the Binaries and emoluments are over $5,000 and uuder -510,000. 3. Similar reduction of fifteen per cent on compensations between $2,000 and $5,000. 4. The reduction of salaries of members of Congress to $2,000 per annum, subject to a for feiture of $10 for each time that a member does not answer to his name on a call of the yoas and nays, and the reduction of mileage to ten cents per mile from the post office nearest the member's residence to Washington city, esti mated by the nearest mail route. 5. The absolute and total abolition of the franking privilege. C. The cessation of the system of appointing supernumerary officials, and the reduction ?f the officials in all the departments of the govern ment to the number actually requisite for the proper transaction of business. On all the points embraced in this proposl I Mon we fully coincide with Mr. Conkling. except j only in regard to the salaries. The salaries of j the officials under our government, from that of President down to that of Custom House officer, are all loo small. It would be better to increase than 1o diminish them. The President ot the I. nitcd Stales should not bo confined to lhe pitiful salary of if 25,000, which is less than the average income of respeclable lawyers in good practice. But to all the other abomina tions aimed at ? mileage, tiie franking privilege, and the swarming of offices with superfluous officials ? there should be no mercy shown. They should be ruthlessly swept away. Why should members of Congress be allowed ton times as much for travelling as It actually costs them, or why should they have any exclu" sive privilege in the mails more than any other citizens? As they are supposed to pay for their boots and hats, so they should have to pay for their stationery and postage. Let there be no deadheads in the Post Office Department, whe ther they be members of Congress or newspaper proprietors. This is not the country for any exclu sive distinctions, and it is certainly full time that ' all such should cease. Let the Committee ?f Ways and Means, then, report back such portions of Mr. Conkling's bill as lop off all th,>se costly excrescences; but let them not do anything so foolish as to attempt to cut down the salaries of government officials. We hope, if the commit tee do report such a bill, that neither house will, by any parliamentary manoeuvring, avoid coming up to a fair and square vote upon it. Let us see who are really in favor of cutting down judiciously the expenses of the govern ment. Railroad Jobs. ? Now that the elections are over there is a general rush after the special jobs for the next Legislature. Especially is this true in regard to the Broadway Railroad project, there being no less than three schemes for a railroad in that street. The manager* of each are working night and day, preparing for a grand rush to Albany the moment tho Legis lature assembles. Our citizens may therefore look for a grand struggle for that prize with the Tribune, the organ of one clique, and the Times fbr another. Tho probable result will be, that after fighting each other until they are tired a compromise will be agreed upon, and the long coveted prize secured. Tho property holders along Broadway, who have so long fought tho seliemers, will have to bestir themselves, or a railroad will bo forced upon them by the coming Legislature. The railroad philosophers claim that the complexion of the Legislature just suits their purpose. Tub Health Bill Rkviveb.? The parties who have for several years past been paying regular annual visits to Albany to lobby for the purpose of securing the passage of a Health bill, of powers numerous and extensive, are again on the more for the same project. Wo ; understand that they ore now on a pilgriig?go ' ' to the rural districts for the purpose of securing ; a pledge from tho country members before they ro*.oh Albany, thus to insure its pas^o n| an ? t ally day. In this the republicans tnpe to rot ' control of one or two more tkiMrtmouts in the I city Tng MAToiui/rr Eukmon.? ' The suco\? of the republican candidate for Major will b^ing about numerous change* in the city gorernaiMfct, I and already there is considerable commotion among ihe politicians and office holders in re gard to the prospects in this line. The nume rous rumors that are afloat in the city in refe rence to the probability of the sucutda of Mr. Gunthnr over Mr. Opdyke originate from those who expect to be cut abort in their offices as soou as Mr. Opdyke seats himself in the Mayor alty chair. It is an old game, and has been re" peuted u dozen times in t,Lij city, got up for the purpose of diverting attention from themselves, and in hopes of really briuging about a change in the result. The same mode was resorted to when Wood was successful over liarker, the Know Nothing candidate; but in this case, as then, they will not bo able to accomplish any thing. The plurality of Opdyke can hardly be overcome by any inforinalltL's discovered iu the returns. The politicians may as well prepare themselves for their fate, and such as are in oflices where they can be reached by the new Mayor elect had better pack up their traps aud prepare for an evacuation. L.Tj. D. Ritsskll and Foiikign Akiutration in American Affairs. ? In a recent letter to the London Times, L.L. D. Russell states that our government is in favor of having our domestic troubles arbitrated and settled by foreign in terference. This is of a piece with some of Russell's other fine stories. The idea of foreign arbitration originated with Governor Hicks, of Maryland, who wished the whole matter left to Lord Lyons, whose decision would have been as silly and ungrammatical as his letter to Sec" retary Seward. The Emperor of Russia also had a notion that he could arrange our affairs satisfactorily to all concerned; and Smith O'JJrienand Grantley Berkley offered to do the job for us very cheaply. It is not very likely thut we will ask for foreign arbitrament when, in Senato, on Wednesday, a proposition by Sil(\ Saulsbury, of Delaware, to appoint Peace Commissioners of our own, was unanimously laughed down. So we are not ready to try to settle the matter peaceably ourselves, yet much less to allow outsiders to settle it. When we do wish strangers to interfere in our family quarrels we will lot England know by some means more reliable than Russell's letters. How the Tribune Abolitionists Arr> the Rebei? Abboap. ? Some time ago the Tribune published a letter from Its Washington corres pondent under the heading, "How Our Army is Not an Army." The letter contained statements that the rebel force on the Potomac was greater than ours; that the enemy had all along shown greater generalship than we; that our army was a " mere mob," and that our whole military array was confused, disorderly and ridiculous. This letter was published in the Tribune of October 24, aud wo find it again, published con spicuously in the London Times of November 19, and doing it3 mean work of encouraging the rebels and discouraging tho Unionists abroad, and of furnishing ammunition to English jour nals in the rebel interest. And yet the Tribune i3 perpetually prating of its own loyalty and the "rebel sympathies" of the Herald. The real rebel sympathizer is the Tribum, which gives aid and comfort to our enemies at home and abroad, and which, by such malicious misrepresentations of our forces and their disci pline, not only makes rebellion bolder, but fans the flame of foreign interference, which, it fondly hopes, will come, some day, to forcibly disrupt tho Union, and thus rid abolitionists of any further "fellowship with slaveholders." Captain Wilkes and British Retaliation. ? By the steamer Northern Light we have received information that the West India agents of the British West India Mail Steamship Company have decided to refuse to sell coal to United States war steamers, by way of retaliation for the arrest of Ma*on and 31idell by Captain Wilkes. In some quarters this report, if true, is regarded as an avant courrier of the retaliatory measures England will take, aud as an indica tion of the English opinion of the seizure. ThU is all nonsense. We have as yet received no in formation that the news of the arrest has reach ed England, and the action of the agents of the West India company is therefore only local, and the result of local pique, unauthorized by the English directors of the company. So far from John Bull, or the English steamship companies, making any trouble about this seizure, he will thank Captain Wilkes for allowing the Trent to proceed on her voyage uuconfiscated. John Bull cares more for one vessel aud her cargo than for all the Masons and Slidells on record, and will doubtless be glad to be relieved of such traitorous intriguers. Secretary Welles ox the Trent Seizure.? We publish this morning a congratulatory letter from Secretary Welles to Captain Wilkes and the officers and crew of the San Jacinto, thank j ing them for the eminent service they have ren dered the government by the arrest of the rebel emissaries Mason and rilidell. The point of this letter which deserves especial notice is its remarks upon the legality of the seizure. While some of our thin skinned journalists have been consulting Vattel, Puffendorf, Wheaton and a host of other writers upon international law, and laboring desperately to prove that white is white, Secretary Welles accepts the fact as in disputable, and assures the gallant Captain that, while he did his duty in arresting Mason and Slidell, he should also have seized " the vessel which had these public enemies on board," and reminds him that " the forbearance, excusable in this instance, must not be permit ted to constitute a precedent hereafter for in fractions of neutral obligations." This is the correct, common sense view of the case and in deed so obvious was the justice and legality of Captain Wilkes' act that the President regards it as a commonplace policc arrest, and does not think it worthy of mention in his Message. The idea of England causing any trouble about the matter is ridiculous. The Sheriff Fees. ? We understand that a bill has been prepared, to be Introduced in the next Legislature, on an early day of the session, re ducing the fees of the office of Sheriff. The fees of that officer have already been reduced by the Board of Supervisors several thousand dol lars. During the canvass preceding the State election tho clamor was so strong that Super visor Tweed, then a candidate for SherifT, was forced to move th? reduction of fees on the re- 1 ! ports from some of the minor courts from fifty cents to thirteen, making a difference of several thousand dollars in the receipts of tho office on that class of business alone. An attempt will be in ido t > make still further redactions at Al Iw.y and wo are informed that the movers in tho I project contemplate ineiudiog the office afCouafcy , Clerk. We preuume Uutt the lobby, a?u?uLl,wii? have something to say about this, and perhaps decide the question, as in the past. Th?s no sooner are the politicians out of one flght thad' they are forced into another. Mo peace for Ube pricked. .Tim Famink ur Ikkland. ? The suggestion wMo.h we threw out a few dayH since for the ap probation by CongroM of a sum for tho pur chase of food for the relief of tho starviug poor of Ireland has met with very general concur rence from tho press and public. As a measure of benevolence, it would only be a repetition inr another form of the aid afforded by us to the poor of that country in the famine of 1840-47' Since then, however, the Irish people have ac quired an additional claim upon oar sympathy. Ottr adopts citizens of that nationality have throughout the present crisis of our affairs been among the most devoted, unselfish and eelf-sacrl ficing supporters of the Union. There is no way in which we could ho well attest our sens* of tbeir patriotic conduct as by allocating by ? vote of the natioual legislature ft Bum sufficient for the purchase of seve ral cargoes of breadstuff's for the relief of their suffering kindred. Gaunt famine is stalking through the land, and before the slow machinery of English official aid oun be brought to interpose it will have swept away thousands of its population. Whatever Is to be don? for their relief on this side should therefore be dono promptly. It has been objected by sonto that, in tho present ticklish condition of our relations with England, the passage of a vote by Congress for this purpose might be takon in tho light of an insult. There may be something in this. Where there is a disposition to quarrel tho beat inten tions are subject to misapprehension. Perhaps, on the whole, the better plan of carrying ou> the object in view would be by calling a public meeting of our citizens and inviting subscrip tions. Our leading merchants should stir in tho matter, and request of tho Mayor to take steps to give effect to the feeling so generally mani fested in regard to it. Tho example once sel in New York, would be immediately followed by every city, town and village iu the Uuion. Election Canvassers. ? The instructions to the inspectors and canvassers of eleotions are, to say the least, exceedingly complicated, and not one man out of twenty who are appointed to those positions is able to understand or comprehend his duties. There are four sots of officials, viz: ? Registrars, inspectors, poll clorks and canvassers. The instructions to this class of officials are all mixed up together in one book, containing some seventy-five pages; each official is obliged to pick out hi* instruc tions by bits in different portions of tho book. The inspectors and canvassers are sworn in on the morning of tho election; they are then hand ed their book of instructions, which they see then for the first time. Without a moment of time to examine their books, they commence their duties, and, afier closing their labors f <r the day, sit down and read their bock of tsoven ty-five pages to sec what their duties are. Sinoo tho returns for several districts have not be n made up to this time, it is to he presumed that the canvassers are yet reading their instructions. This evil should be obviated by seme simple and explicit instruction to each class ol elec tion officials, iu such a short, Bite 'inct and com prehensive fonn as to bo understood by any person in fivo minutes' examination. Scukmk3 of the PoT.mriA.Ns. ? Since the re publicans have succeeded in electing their Mayor there are symptoms of sharp practice being resorted to by the politicians. In tho first place, the republican Mayor will go into office with both branches of the municipal legisla* ture opposed to him ; and if he makes any ap ' pointments that do not please the Aldermen they will not be confirmed; and to retaliate for that refusal the republican Legislature will step in and aid the new Mayor. This will at once arouse opposition between those two legislative bodies, and develope many new schemes but little thought of at present. On the other hand, should the Common Council pass any enor mously expensive job, tho Mayor will prob ably veto it, and if the Common Council manifest a disposition to pass it over his veto the Legislature will again be appealed to for power to attend to municipal legis lative philosophers. Thus we have in the election of a republican to the office of Mayor a fair prospect of a general quarrel between the different branches of th? city government, and we are not sure but thut the city will be the gainer by it, provided that we have soma effective legislation, and the power is given to the Mayor which rightly belongs to his office.
