Notice of an Amendment to the Canal Bill Given In Senate-Nicaragua Ar. ralgned for Granting a Concession to Americans Who Wish to "Obstruct a Great National Poltcy"-Couduot of Americans Attacked Nicaragua's Right to Slake the Concession Ques tioned. Washington, Dec. 7. As a result of the meeting of the senate committee on the Nicaragua canal to-day Senator Morgan gave notice In the senate of an amendment to the Nicaragua canal bill authorizing the issuance, with a guar antee by this government, of five mil lion dollars in bonds for the redemption of all outstanding stock except thai held by the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the cancellation of all obligations. He also submitted a report dealing exclusively with the fact that the government of Nicaragua has granted a concession to construct a canal to another company than the Maritime Canal company. The report upholds the rights of the Maritime Canal company for the present and for an extension of its concession for ten years more. It arraigns the conduct of the republic of Nicaragua as well as that of the American citizens securing the new concession in the most severe terms, attributing the course of Nica ragua to jealousy of Costa Rica, and that of the concessionaires for a pur pose to "obstruct a great national pol icy in selling out to a transcontinental railway company for the defeat of a supposed competitor." "It would be well," the report says, "for the reputation of those concerned in thus dishonoring governments for their personal advantage and using their powers to create jealousies be tween states, if it could appear that their conduct is not also corrupt." The committee adduces as a just justifica tion of the new report the seriousness of the situation, saying on this point: "The serious consequences likely to re sult to the United States from this un precedented and unwarranted action of the late government of Nicaragua and the evident purpose to force our gov ernment into payment of a large sum as compensation for the future consent of the republic of the United States of Central America to the creation of a maritime canal through the San Juan river and Lake Nicaragua requires the committee to present the grounds on which it insists that this proceeding Is without any support in law, justice or equity, and that it violates the hitherto cordial relations of the United States with Nicaragua." The report takes issue with the con tention that Nicaragua owns both banks of the San Juan river, declaring that Costa Rica has equal rights since the arbitration of President Cleveland as to the owner of one bank of the stream. The report states that in mak ing the concession of right of way granted by Nicaragua no mention was made of Nicaragua's claim, rendering It incumbent upon Nicaragua to put the canal company in possession of the channel of the river. "Here," the report cays, "was a breach of the agreement for which the canal company has paid $150,000 that entitled the company to the return to the money and other damag es. It also imposed on the United States the duty of campelltng redress if redress had been sought." It Is as serted that in view of the fact that Nicaragua had made the concession it was her duty to obtain a ccno:ss'.on from Costa Rica when the claims of that country were established, but in stead of that it is pointed out, Nicara gua made a formal threat to renounce Its concession if any concession was ob tained from Costa Rica. "Thus," the committee concludes, "by conduct equivalent to main force Nic aragua prevented progress in the work of the canal and put a cloud upon the credit of the company that could not tie otherwise than disastrous." The re port contends that the circumstances of the concession point to the fact that the concession provides for a charter to be granted to the "United States. "In this attitude," the report continues, " the duties and the responsibilities of Nic aragua are very high, if they do not even rise to the dignity of solemn pledges and consequent sovereign re spcnsiblltles to the United States whose intervention is sought in the charter ing of the corporation." It is tfr!n set forth that Costa Rica'B interests In the canal are as great as those of Nicara gua, "and it follows that the action of those republics is essential to the con cession. If Nicaragua claims that the concession it has granted is forfeited, Costa Rica has the equal right to assert that It is not forfeited." It is then set forth that the United States is a party to the measure of building the canal at the instance of both Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and it is claimed that the consent of this coun try is also necessary to any proceeding on the part of Nicaragua looking to the forfeiture of the concession. "Nicara gua," the report asserts, "cannot re peal an act of congress which dictates the canal and its concessionary inci dents to a corporation chartered for euch great purposes." The report says that the concession provides for the submission of any dispute to arbitra tion, and it is claimed that this provis ion operates to prevent any arbitrary action on the part of Nicaragua." Dwelling upon Nicaragua's course in the matter, the report says: "Hothis unexampled condition is to be dealt with otherwise than by an expressed and determined attitude on the part of the United States is a question that carries with it the danger of serious embarrassment in the future. If Nica ragua is not held to the performance of her agreement years will elapse and - many dangers will be encountered be fore even a start can b made toward 6be construction of a canal." 

AMERICAN TRADE IN CHINA. rhenomenul Strides Made In Foochow May Lead Other Countries, Washington Dec. 7. Consul General Fowler at Foochow has called the at tention of the state department to the phenomenal strides made by American trade in that section of China. He says that when the books of 1898 are closed the value of American merchandise im ported there will equal if not exceed the values for all countries. American gin seng also made its first apearance as an article of import. The Imports of drills for the first six months of this year ex ceeded those of the entire year of 1893 and 1S94, and the exports of all our goods in 1897 were four times as largo as they were in 1893. The value of im ports into Cheefoo was almost ten tlme3 greater than those specified as from Great Britain. The consul statos that the value of American imports into the single Chinese city of Cheefoo exceeds the entire value of our exports to any one of forty-one separate countries which he names, including such coun tries as Guatamala, Peru, Dutch East Indies, Portugal and Switzerland and that not more than twenty of the 26 political divisions of the world's com merce wrould show a greater value of our exports than does Cheefoo. He says that the value of American exports to three North China ports Tien Tain, Niuchwang and Ch'eefoo last year ex ceeded our combined sales to all the central American states. AFFAIRS IN CHINA.

SITUATION IN PHILIPPINES THE NATIVE PRESS STILL AVVO C ATI NO INDEPENDENCE. Would Reimburse the United States to the Extent of the Amount of Money Paid to Spaln-Thls Course Believed the Only Just One Agulnaldo Recog nizes the Importance of a Strong Pro tectorate. Manila, Dec. 7. The native press continues to advocate independence and a reimbursement to the United States of the amount to be paid Spain. The 1 Independencia thinks this course the only just one. It insists that the Fili pinos have aided the Americans solely because they believed they were fight ing for independence. The paper quotes liberally from President McKin ley's last speech in Chicago to support its contention that the Americans are pledged to give the Filipinos independ ence. Chief Aguinaldo and his principals fully recognize the importance of a strong protectorate In some form. One of the latter has even ventured the as sertion that If the Filipinos were grant- ed independence in accordance with the : demand of the leaders, the United j States would be asked to establish a I protectorate as, otherwise the Philip-! pines must sooner or later become th prey of a less liberal country. This statement is borne out by the attitude of the better class of Filipinos in the vicinity of Manila.

Ex-Presl-dent Grover Cleveland was Interview ed this afternoon on the new policy of the United States and dictated the fol lowing for the Associated Press: "Without going at all Into details I wish to say that I am ardently opposed to every feature of this annexation and expansion policy. The public ought to know pretty well what my convictions are from the Hawaiian question during my administration. I have not chang ed my mind and am opposed to all this annexation from Hawaii to the Philip pines." THE NEWS FROM HAVANA. Comment of the Press Upon President McKlnley's Message. Havana, Dec. 7. The local press shows a sharp division in the com ments upon President McKinley's mes sage to congress. El Pais and LaLucha find an analagy between the mess'igj and the joint resolution of April last constituting, in their opinion, proof that the United States government is determined to carry out the promises solemnly contracted before the world. El Dio De La Marina, La Union Avis dor, El Comercio, La Union Yberia and 1SI Leon uspanai see in tne message a veiled desire that the president's policy is to occupy the island for an indefinite period with a view of ultimately an- nexing it. These papers loudly de- i nounce the passage in the message which urges co-operation and assist - ance in every possible form for the social and moral reform of tne island.. The Idea of qualifying the Cubans to administer their own affairs is repre- sented by this secln of the press as '.'an insult and an ominous warning." Mr. Gould, who has been distributing the Bratton's relief supplies, returned last night from his trip to Matanzas, Cardenas, Sagua, Calbarlen, Santa Clara and Santo Domingo. He reports great suffering and want all over the island. While distribution of the pres ent supplies will relieve distress in cer tain Quarters for a time, he deems it imperative that further shipments should be made at once. In every case Mr. Gould has solicited the co-operation of the local authorities In the local towns and vilalges and he has derived this month. He has not yet given up great assistance from them.

Boston, Dec. 7. At a special meeting of the Harvard college overseers, this morning, it was voted to place women upon the visiting committee of the de partment of the college. President Elilot after the meeting explained that one of the women is Mrs. Henry W. Draper of New York, an expert in as tronomy. Mrs. Draper has given $10,000 a year to the observatory, and it was considered a proper thing to recognize her generosity by putting her on the committee of the visitors of the obser vatory.

General Miles' BUI Iguored-Hull Meas ure Provides for a Lieutenant-General, Six Major-Generals and Twelve Brigadier Generals -Artillery Arm Re-orgunlzed-Cavalry Increased Two Regiments, Infantiy Five-Big In crease In Medical Department. Washington, Dec. 7. Representative Hull, chairman of the house committee on military affairs, to-day introduced the bill for Increasing the regular army to approximately 100,000, men. The bill was framed at the war department and has the approval of the secretary of war. It is not the bill framed by Gen eral Miles, as this measure has not the high rank proposed by the Miles bill, and some of the appointments are open to officers of the volunteers or to men from civil life. It provides for a lieu tenant general and what is considered a sufficient Increase of majors and brig adier generals to command an army of 100,000 men. The artillery arm Is re organized, separating it into coast and field artillery, but promotion is to be by seniority of the whole army. A de crease of the enlisted men is made so that the army can be increased by re cruits in case of war to full strength. The cavalry is increased two regiments, the infantry five. The enlisted strength of an infantry company is not to exceel 145 so that in case of war new regiments would have to befoimed probably all of which would be volunteers, but the regular army would make a substantial first lien. The bill provides for the three battalion formation. The staff corps are increas ed about 40 per cent, and with the ex ception of the adjutant general, inspec tor general and ordnance are open to appointments from the volunteers and civil life. The most notable change is that in the medical department, in which provison is made for a hospital corps of 3,000 privates with the nec essary non-commissioned officers with a largely increased number of surgeons and assistant surgeons. All officers and men serving in the sub-tropical country are to have in in crease of 25 per cent, in pay. Under the immediate control of the president inhabitants of the new countries may be enlisted. Chairman Hull's bill is cast on entirely different lines from General Miles' bill. he latter is based on the theory of one soldier for every 10,000 population. General Miles' bill provides for a general and two lieu tenant generals, while Mr. Hull's bill does not mention these officers. , The Hull bill in its first section sums up the reorganized army as follows: One lieutenant general, six major generals, twelve brigadier generals, twelve regi ments 'of cavalry, a corps of artillery, thirty regiments of Infantry, an adju tant general's department, an inspec tor general's department, a judge advo cate general's department, a quarter master's department, a subsistence de partment, a medical department, a pay department, a corps of engineers, an ordnance department, a signal corps, thirty post chaplains, the chief pfthe record and pension office, the officers of the army on the retired list, the pro fessors, corps of cadets, an army ser vice detachment and band at the United States military academy, and such oth er officers and enlisted men as may hereafter be provided for. The Tegimental organization of the artillery arm of the army is discontin ued and that arm is designated as the corps of artilery. The distinction be tween coast and field artillery is simi lar to that in the Miles bill, but more elaborate in detail. The Atlantic divi sion of the coast is defined to include the Atlantic and the gulf seaboards and the coast of the great lakes and shall ultimately include the coast line of the West Indian possessions of the United States. The Pacific division is defined to include the Pacific seaboard and shall ultimately include the coast line of the various possessions of the United States In the Pacific ocean. The corps of artillery embraces 144 batteries of coast artillery and twenty four field batteries. Each regiment of infantry consists of twelve companies, organized Into three battalions of four companies each. The company strength in addition to commissioned and non commissioned officers is 112 men. In various staff corps express provision is made that persons who have served as officers in the volunteer army in the war with Spain and persons in civil ilfe may be appointed to various speci fied grades. Section 16 is as follows: Organizations serving in Cuba, Porto Rico and the Islands of the Pacific may in the discretion of the president be re cruited in whole or in part from the in habitants thereof to whom the legal restrictions upon enlistments in the ar my as regards term of service, age, citizenship and educational qualifica tions shall not apply and who shall be entitled to such pay and allowances not exceeding those now authorized as the president may direct.

Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 7. William A. L Burden, class ot 1900, who has played left guard on this year's eleven, was to-day elected captain of the Harvard varsity football team for next year. The election of Burden has been generally expected at Harvard ever since the Yale game, but outsiders thought Daly, the quarter-back, to be the natural choice. The latter is extremely young and It was not thought best to run the risk of spoiling so good a player by giving him the heavy responsibilities of the captaincy. This is Burden's first year on the 'varsity eleven, but he has played on the second eleven since his freshman year. Before this year he had not been considered good enough for the 'varsity team. Burden is 21 years old, weighs 180 pounds and is 8 feet 1 inch In height. He is the son of I. Townsend Burden of New York and received his preparatory education at the Groton school. Cornell. N. Y..

Resolution of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. ' Richmond, Va., Dec. 7. With to-day's session of the Union of American He brew congregations, in convention here the following report on the economist movement w-as adopted: "The Union of American Hebrew congregations in convention assembled, in view of the active propaganda being made at pres ent for the so-called economist move ment, deefs It proper and necessary to put itself on record as follows: While we are aware and deplore the abject condition to which many of our breth ren are subjected in foreign lands and that have naturally, but unfortunately aroused in some of them a yearning for a re-establishment of Zlon, yet we delegates are opposed to political econ omism. The Jews are not a nation, but a religious community. Zion was a precious possession of the past, the early home of our faith, where our prophets uttered their world-subduing thoughts and our psalmists sang their world enchanting hymns. As such it is a holy memory. America is 'our Zion. Here in the home of free religious in stitutions we have aided In founding this Zion." , . HENRY B. HYDE. Business Career of the Insurance Presi dent Probably Closed. ',! New York, Dec. 7. It is thought that the business career of Henry B. Hyde, president of the Equitable Life insur ance society is closed. Neither his phy sician nor his friends have any hope that he will ever again be able to em ploy his financial genius In the direction of the great corporation which he cre ated. He is but 64 years of age but a life that has been absolutely devoted to business has shattered his nervous sys tem and brought about a chronic dis ease of the heart. He has chosen as his successor James W. Alexander, the first vice president of the Equitable com pany. He is named as the next presi dent in Mr. Hyde's place, for Mr. Hyde has the right to so name his successor. But Mr. Hyde will remain president of the society until he dies even though Mr. Alexander be the president in fact.

Insurance of 9110,000 Carried Four Hundred Men Thrown Out of Work Company to Resume Operations as Soon as Possible-Fire Caused by Leak in Air Pump Connected With Gas Plant. Danbury, Dec. 7. The extensive hat factory of John W. Green & Co., on9 of the largest in the city, was complete ly destroyed by fire shortly before 8 o'clock to-night. The loss will be up wards of $150,000; insurance, $110,000. Four hundred men are thrown out of employment and 4,500 dozen hats in the rough destroyed. It is one of the most serious fires that Danbury has experi enced for a long time, but the firm hopes to continue business without de- lay if quarters can be secured. James Marshall of Fall River was a member of the concern. The Are was caused by a leak in the air pump connected with the gas plant that the company oper ated. An explosion resulted when the fire reached the 600 gallon naphtha tank that was connected with the plant, but there were no injuries. The factory plant comprised several frame buildings, all of which were destroyed. Th incipient blaze was discovered by Watchman John McTierney and soon Assistant Fire Chief Peter Beckerle and Daniel Jelenkie, a hatter, who Uvea nearby, were on the scene and ehdeav-" ored to extinguish the flames. The factory hose was utilized and two streams were turned on, but on account of the lack of pressure the kinks were not taken out of th hose and the water service was utterly useless. Before the efforts to extinguish the flames by wa ter were made, soft coal was freely shoveled on with the hopes of extin guishing the blaze, without effect, in the meantime the gas had been contin ually escaping and automatic sprink lers, with which the factory was equipped, proved useless and the fire department found it ' impossible to reach the scene on acount of the snow. In less than three-quarters of an hour the main factory, a three-story struct- ure 250 feet long, was a mass of flames. The drying room was immediately above the place where the fire started and this facilitated the progress of the flames. There wers several buildings connected with the main building, and as they were all frame structures they . furnished ready material - for the flames. The box factory, which was connect- . ed, was also three stories high, 150x75 . feet, and as it was full of combustible material, the fire continued unchecked. In connection with the main plant were several buildings, including the stock room, the make shop and the gas plant, and when the flames reached the last -named In which upwards of 600 gallons of naphtha was stored, there was a terrific explosion. Fortunately, how ever, there was no loss of life or no ser lous injucs. .The fire was of such a nature that nothing could be done to check it, and one of the members of the firm, who was early on the scene, had to witness the outcome of years of endeavor go up in smoke. The insur ance was all placed by a local agency. ANTI-TICKET SCALPING BILL Passes House by Vote of J 19 to 101 Senate's Doings. Washington, Dec. 7.
