DAILY INDEPENDENT. t TUESDAY DEC. 10, 1889. County Official Paper. SECRETARY WINDOM ON SIL VER. The Secretary of the Treasury has presented a report in which he recommends that the Mints of the United States be opened for the free deposit of silver, the market value of the same (not to exceed $1 for 412^ grains of standard silver) to be puid in treasury notfcs. Said notes to be redeemable in the quantity of silver which could be purchased by the number of dollars expressed on the face of the note at the time it was presented for payment, or in gold at the option of the government. If the price of silver should advance between the date of the issue of the note and its payment the holder of the note would receive a less quantity of silver than he deposited; but if the price of silver should decline the holder of the note would not receive more silver than he deposited. This proposition is unfair on its face, for while the holder of the note would be compelled to stand an advance in the price of silver he would not have the advantage of a decline; and as can l>e readily seen gold is to be the standard in all transactions, and sil ver takes the place of a mere com modity in the markets. This is the plan which President Harrison suys "seems to satisfy the purpose to continue the use of silver in connection with our currency," and obviates the danger which he foresees would follow either free coin age or any considerable increase of the present rate of coinage. It is clear that the silver men are to be arrayed against the combined forces of the administration, the Speaker of the House of Representa tives, the National Banks and Wall street with its combination of bond holders* hence we fear that but little in favor of the white metal will be accomplished during the present session of Congress. But he who hesitates is lost, and the friends of silver should put on a bold front, stand firm to the cause of free coin age, make no compromise with the enemy, and in the ond victory will l>eroh upon our banners. The people will eventually awake to their own interests and in spite of the Presi dent's message, in spite of Windom's cunning theories, in spite of the com bined powers of Wall street capitalists und National bankers they will de mand in thunder tones that will take no denial, the return of silver to the position to which it naturally belongs us the money of the people. Adamantine Cheek. The English financiers keep a oloBe watch of affairs on this side of the water. When?some time ago ?it wua reported that the full limit of $4,000, 000 a month in silver was likely to be coined, the white metal advanced in prioe in Iiondon. The President's message reassured the Londoners and a drop in silver followed. Free coin age of Bilver in the United States would he a bitter pill for the English to swallow just now when they have got everything working so charmingly Imtweon their little island and India. ?[Virginia Enterprise. And yet the Itepublioan press, the Enterprise not excepted, has had the supreme effrontery to claim that the Demooratio party is the party that favors British interests and enter prises, but now the admission is iraukly made that President Harri son is the friend of British capital in his hostility to silver. Vur.ly the world do move. THE
