MM is as FEEDING NEW CORN. Being Difficult to Digest, Much Is Wasted. Grinding the Corn. Much of the corn crop this year will be soft. It will be what farmers call new corn until freezing dries out its surplus moisture. Yet the hogs have to be fattened for slaughtering in Decem ber or January, and there will have to be a good deal of it fed out without dry ing to cows and other stock. American Cultivator has the following to say on the subject of feeding new com: Probably the cow can get more good ont of soft com than any other farm an imal. She will bring it up and remasti cate it, insuring partial digestion if she has not had an overfeeding of com, for it must be remembered that all com is hard to digest, and when it is full of moisture it is more so than ever. Grind the com, even if into coarse bits, and it is made much more easy to digest. When fattening hogs are fed fine com meal, some of it will go through them undigested, but when new com is fed to stock the part that fails to digest is mnch greater. It is very hard to grind new corn. The mois ture in it makes the grain stick to the grinding apparatus. But if some well dried oats, com or barley are mixed with the com not yet dried out it will grind mnch better. When it is desired to grind corn on the cob, the trouble is that the cob breaks into large pieces, in stead of being ground as it should. But if whole grain of any kind is mixed with tho ears so as to fill spaces the cob will grind perfectly. For feeding cows and other homed cattle there is an advantage in grinding com in t | le ear The ground cob makes the , . . . ° ^ A •. ji i nutriment less concentrated and it di ; ß e f bctter ff . .. fpd to As new soft com is usually fed to hogs, a great part of its nutrition IS -wasted. It is so-jnuch harder to digest than the same com after it has dried, that it is much better to feed sound corn if it can bo bad and reserve the soft com until it dries out by freezing. There is great shrinkage during this drying out process, but there is more fattening quality in the smaller quantity than there is in tho larger. Com is almost universally fed while it is full of the juices of the stalk and cob. If the feeding of the crop were spread out during the whole winter, in stead of being confined to fall and one of the winter months, the gain from feeding it would be far greater than it is. Much of the larger part of this sea son's com crop will be fed to hogs, cat tle and sheep between now and next January or February at furthest. It is done to hurry up the fattening, but ow ing to the indigestibility of new com much of it is wasted. The pork and beef thus made are neither so palatable nor so healthy as tbe same would be if hogs and cattle were fed from their ear liest period sufficient to keep them in thrifty and growing condition. It is the common practice of wasting new com during the fall and winter months that makes this impossible. A small amount of grain given while animals are at grass in summer will produce far more flesh and of a better quality than a much larger quantity fed as wastefully as new corn usually is. Successful Wintering of Bees. Whatever method be followed in win tering bees certain conditions regarding the colony itself are plainly essentiaL First, it shonld have a good queen; seo ond, a fair sized cluster of healthy bees, neither too old nor too young; third, a plentiful supply of good food. The third essential, good food, says Frank Benton, assistant entomologist, department of agriculture, is secured if the hive is lib erally supplied with well ripened hon ey from any source whatever, or with fairly thick sirup, made from white cane sugar, which was fed early enough to enable tbe bees to seal it over before ihey ceased flying Fifteen to 20 pounds lor outdoor wintering in the south, up to 80 or 40 pounds in the north, when wintered outside with but slight pro tection, or if wintered indoors 15 to 20 pounds may be considered a fair supply of winter food. A smaller amonnt should not be trust ed except in case much greater protec tion be furnished against the effects of severe weather than is usually giveu. A greater amount of stores will do no harm if properly arranged over and abont the «enter of the cluster, or in case the combs are narrow wholly above the cluster. In many instances it will be a benefit by equalizing in a measure the temperature in the hive as weU as by giving to the bees greater confidence in extending tbe brood nest in early spring. the vacant A Potato Crop That Paid. Cornell university at Ithaca, N. Y., is a noted agricultural college and ex periment station. Usually most of the experiments are made without caring much for profit. But this year the man agers determined to grow potatoes on a scale sufficiently large to determine whether this crop can be grown cheap ly enough under scientific treatment to make the crop profitable. The season, as all know, was very unfavorable for potatoes wet through the summer and dry as the potatoes should be maturing. Yet, as reported by American Cultiva tor, on the field fertilized with 20 loads of stable manure per acre tbe yield per acre was 3S0 bushels and on land un fertilized was 300 bushels. As the gen eral average of the potato crop in New York is only 65 bushels per acre, the farmers at Cornell have reason to con gratulate themselves on their success. The station potatoes were also free from rot, due doubtless to the liberal use of bordeaux mixture and other fungicides. At present prices of potatoes the crop this year is undoubtedly a pay lug owe. it of ty of to it a the as be, of be, to the ing iu less fill at the the the 

RETURNS FROM AN APIARY. , i A Moderate Estimate For a Fairly Good Locality. Apiculture, like all other branches of agriculture, depends largely upon the natural resources of the location, and tho favorableness or unfavorableness of any particular season, no matter how skillful the management, may make great differences in the year's return. The knowledge, skill, industry and promptness of the one who undertakes the care of the apiary have likewise much to do with the return. Further more, profits are of course largely affect ed by the nature and proximity of the markets. Frank Benton, assistant ento mologist of the agriculture department at Washington, writing in this connec tion, says: À moderate estimate for a fairly good looality would be 80 to 85 pounds of ex tracted honey or 20 pounds of comb honey per colony. This presupposes good wintering and an average season. When two or more of the important honey yielding plants are present in abundance and are fairly supplemented by minor miscellaneous honey plants, the locality may be considered excellent, and an expectation of realizing more than the yield mentioned above may be entertained. With extracted honey of good quality at its present wholesale price of 6 to 7 cents per pound and comb honey at 12 to 18 cents, each hive should under favorable circumstances give a gross annual return of $2.50 to $3. From this about one-third is to be deducted to cover expenses other than the item of labor. i.These will include the purchase of comb foundation and sections, repairs, eventual replacing of hives and imple ments and the interest on the capital invested. By locating in some section particu larly favorable to apiculture—that is, near large linden forests, with clover fields within range, supplemented by buckwheat, or in a section where alfalfa is raised for seed, where mesquite, Cal ifornia sages and wild buckwheat abound, where mangrove, palmettoes and titi, or where sourvvood, tulip trees and asters are plentiful—the net profits here indicated may frequently be dou bled or trebled. But these favored locations are also subject to reverses, the result of droughts, great wet, freezes which kill back the bee pasturage, etc., and, though some years the profits are so much larger than those named above as to lend a very roseate hue to the outlook for the accumulation of wealth on the part of any one who can possess himself of a hundred or two colonies of bees, the beginner will do well to proceed cau tiously, bearing m mind that mnch ex perience is necessary to enable him to turn to the best account seasons below the average, while during poor seasons it will take considerable understanding of the subject, energetic action and some sacrifice to tide over without disaster. On the whole, there should be expected from the raising of bees for any purpose whatever only fair pay for one's time, good interest on the money invested and a sufficient margin to cover contingen cies. With no greater expectations than this from it, and where intelligence di rects the work, apiculture will be found, in the long run, to rank among the best and safest of rural industries. _ 

NOTES ON COLD STORAGE. Very Low Temperature Not Necessary if the Air Is Kept Pure. At the meeting in Detroit of the So ciety For the Promotion of Agricultural Science Professor Bane of the New Hampshire Agricultural college read a valuable paper on cold storage which placed the matter on a novel basis. The professor made it appear that a very low temperature is not necessary pro vided the air is kept pure. Following are in brief some of the remarks made by Professor Bane: The first essential to this preservation is pure air. For orchard fruits the tem perature should be as low as possible and be above freezing, grapes not need ing so mnch cold. In from 84 to 36 de grees, where light could be excluded and the air kept pure and free from gas es, the fruit will keep indefinitely. The assumption that oxygen is tho agent of decay is erroneous. The condi tions which favor or avert plant growth are the same as those which avert or favor decay. The presence of moisture favors de cay. The first gas generated in a house is carbonic acid gas, and it is the first impurity found in a cold storage house. If temperature is high, there is shrink ing, then softening and loss of flavor. Fruits in a vault in which a candle can not be kept burning are affected as if by frost. Remove this gas as soon as found to be present The temperature for preservation, other things being right, was shown to be not as low as generally supposed, from 30 to 45 being given for apples, 45 to 65 for peaches, 46 for pears, 84 for cabbages and 87 to 89 for fresh beet Butter, Professor Rane said, shonld have 23 degrees and be kept in a room by itself. A description of the station cold storage house, which is on the north side of the barn cellar, was given. The floor is impervious to air. The all im portant part of it is the ventilators which are run across the cellar. The filling between the sheathing is of fine shav ings, packed as tight as possible. The cost, including lumber and labor, was given as $80. The system worked well. Of 800 barrels put in the loss over win ter was very light. Sold in the spring, the price was for first quality. The only expense of the keeping was the labor of hauling. Potatoes stored in the same house kept perfectly. The principle, as explained in the Philadelphia Ledger, which reported the meeting, is in keeping rid of the carbonic acid gas by changing the air by ventilation instead of by the exceed ingly more expensive and troublesome method of chilling and freezing Importers or ~»Ylndbreaks. Windbreaks are placed next in im portance to irrigation by E. P. Powell of New York. Writing to The New England Homestead he tells that in Oneida county, N. Y., there is an or chard of Red Astrakhans one half of which has a windbreak of arbor vitse hedge and the other none. The protect ed part is in perfect condition, the oth er part is nearly dead ; not a thoroughly sound tree in it The crops show the same difference. At another place there are on one side of the street hedges and groups of evergreens, on the north and west on the other side is an open sweep for the wind. The protected land ripens lima beans and Isabella grapes and is as good as a whole degree of latitude warmer than the other. Our serions trouble is not from cold, but from cold, drying winds and speedy changes of temperature. He recommends evergreen screens everywhere, not only hedges but screens of trees, allowed to grow tall without clipping. The arbor vit® is generally best hemlock iu some localities. Nor co wants more room, but is The old plan of letting trees grefw up in fence lines was right Too mnch economy in clearing land is a mis take. The proper trees for windbreaks vary in different parts of the country, bnt this means of protection is very gen erali v useful. in of the the on lie As he of to of is way spru valuable. of m

HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION'. By a special message dated the 16ih day of June last, I laid before the Senate a trea ty signed that day by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the Republic of Hawaii, having for its purpose the incor poration of the Hawaiian Islands as an integral part of the United States, and under its sovereignty. The Senate having removed the injunction of secrecy, al though the treaty is still pending before that body, the subject may be properly re ferred to In this message, because the ne cessary action of the Congress is required to determine by legislation many details of the eventual union should the fact of annexation be accomplished, as I believe it should be. While consistently disavowing from a very early period any aggressive poliey of absorption in regard to the.Hawaiian group, a large series of declarations through three quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital interest of the United States in the independent life of the islands and their intimate commercial dependence upon this country. At the same time it has been repeatedly assereted that in no event could theentity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the passage of the islands under the domliia tion.or influence of another power than the United States. Under these circumstances, the logic of events required that annexa tion, heretofore offered, but declined, should in the ripeness of time come about as the natural result of Ihe strengthening ties that bind us to those islands and be realized by the free will of the Hawaiian state That treaty was unamiously ratified without amendment by the Senn « und President of the Republic of Hawaii the 10th of September last, and only awu..s the* favorable action of the American Senate to effect the complete absorption of the is lands into the domain of the United Stater. What the conditions of such a union shall be, the political relations thereof to the United States, and degree of the elective franchise of the inhabitants, the extension of the Federal laws to the tei ritory or the enactment of special laws to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the regulation, if need be, of the labor system therein, are all mat ters which the treaty has wisely relegated to the Congress. If the treaty is confirmed, as every con sideration of dignity and honor requires, the wisdom of Congress will see to it that, avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements perhaps hardly yet fitted to share in the highest franchises of citizenship, and hav ing due regard to the geographical condi tions, the most just provisions for self-rule iu local matters, with the largest political liberties as an iutegial port of our nation will be accorded to the Hawaiians. No less is due to the people who after nearly five years of demonstrated capability to ful fill the obligations of self-governing state hood, come of their free will to merge their destinies in our body politic. The questions which have arisen between Japan and Hawaii by roaâbn of the treat ment of Japanese laborers emigrating to the islands under the Hawaiian-Japanese convention of 1888, are in a satisfactory stage of settlement by nego.iation. This government has not been invited to medi ate, and on the other hand has sought no intervention in that matter, further than to evince its kindliest disposition toward such a speedy and direct adjustment by the two sovereign states in interest as shall comport with equity and honor. It is gratifying to learn that the appréhensions at first displayed on tbe part of Japan lest the cessation of Hawaii's national life through annexation might impair pri vileges to which Japon honorably laid claim, have given place lb confidence in the uprightness of this government, and in the sincerity ofits purpose to deal with all possible ulterior questions in the broadest spirit of friendliness. Washington .. Letter In every life there must be sorrow! If not today, tl.en tomorrow; But of all sorrows there's uo other. Like the loss of mother. HE great sympathy felt for the be reavemsnt if Pr e s i de n t Mc Kinley tinged the a8sembl i n g of Congress with unusual sadness, which not even the greatest in terest felt iu the strong message of the President could dissipate. There were the usual crowds in the galleries of both House and Sen ate, but sorrow expressed in the faces of Senators and Representatives was reflected iu the faces of the visitors above them. Theie is something in the death of one's mother that appeals to the sympathies of others as does the death of no other relative. - a Had President McKit ley followed the example of his immediate predeces sor, w ho rarely finished one of his mes sages to Congress until the day before Congress me*, his message would not have been ready, but he completed the message a week ago, and did not have on his mind while traveling to the bed side of his strickeu mother, from which lie returned to Wa-hiugtnn In perform the duties incumbent uu«u him a; the opening of tbe session of Congr-ss. As soon as those duties were performed he started for Canton again, carrying with him tbe sorrowful sympa' hies 'of the whole couutry. Tltree P's, patriotism, peace, aud prosperity form tha keynote of Presi dent McKinley's annual message to Congress. His treatment of the an nexation of Hawaii, tha Cuban and other foreign q estious, including that of commercial reciprocity, is patriotic to the core, without (lie slightest trace of jingoism, and his treatment of the financial and oilier domestic questions is that ef a man who only desires that which will coulfuue and in cease tbe prosperity the country is now begin ning to eDjoy. In addition to getting a first class man to fill the important poaition of Attorney General, President McKin ley's choice of Gov. John W. Griggs, of N. J., to fill the vacancy ia the Cabinet that will be made by the nom ; it of of a of to iiiation of Attorney General McKenna to succeed Justice Field, who retired from tbe U. S. Supreine Court last week, after having served there longer than any t.riiis predeccs nrs, is 'em:» sidered to be a good political move one that will aid materially in keeping New Jersey in Ihe Republican Column, j aud the wish is general that Gov. Griggs will accept the tendered poit folio. j The activity in certain quarters in tfforis to make the public lulieve that ' there is some doubt about the siimxh tiou of Hawaii, indicates that situs money is being spent for ihe purpose of creating anti-annexation sentiment. If so, it is being thrown away, as an nexation is absolutely sure to couia be fore tlie close of this season of Qon gress. Two-thirds of the Senate are ready at any time to vote for th > rati fication of the annexation treaty, but the rules of the Senate put it in the power of the opponents—not more than twenty at the outside—to delay the vote. Should it become apparent that this power is bding used for fili bustering purposes, annexation will be secured by legislation, which will only need a majority vote. The more conservative element in Congress is strongly in favor of mak ing this session as shot t as possible. This sentiment was voiced by llepre sentative Heatwole, of Minn., when he said: lu my opinion, this Cong:eas sho lid git through its tontine work by May 1, and adjourn. The smallest amount of leeislutiou v. ill be of the greatest benefit to the countiy, and if we can finish und go home by that, date, a good many millions of our couii'iy men will rise up and call us blessed." Speaker Reed says he sees no excuse at present for make (he session a very l.mg one. » Nothing of m ire general benefit to the.inorals of the country has been done lately than the official announcement of the Boat Office Depar ment that the mails would.hereafter be closed to news papers that print missing-letter woid contests, or any other kind of adver tising matter containing chance or lot lery schemes. Some of the most dar ing swindling of ihe age has been con ducted by tbi- class advertisers, all of which violated the spirit, if no: the letter, of the anti-lottery law. In as much as ubnit $20,010.000 >vil! be expended upon River and Harbor in> -provementN, under contiacts previous ly made, during the uext fi-cal year, there is quite a strong feeling in Con gress iu favor of mniuing llie usual River and Ilarb-ir Appropriation bill at ibis session. No agreement to that effect lias actually been made, but it will not be rurprising should (halbe iheie&nltof the exchanges of opiuiou on ibe subject now g dug on. According to a celebrate! anatomist tbe e are upwards or 2,000,000 little glands in the human stomach. These glands pour out the digestive juices which dissolve or digest the food. Indigestion is want of juice weakness of glands, need of help to restore tbe health of these organs. The best and most natural help is that given by Shaker Digestive Cordial. Natural, because it sup plies the materials needed by the glunds to prepare the digestive juices. Btcause it strengthens aud invigorates the glands and the stomach, until they are able to do their work alone. Shaker Digestive Cordial cures indigestion certainly and pei mancntly. It does so by natural means, and therein lies the secret of its wonderful aud unvaried success. At druggists, price 10 cents to $1.00 per bottle.
