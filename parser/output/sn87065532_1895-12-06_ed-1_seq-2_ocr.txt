The Vopaltuw want to nominate htm for THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Congress has convened, the Presi dent's Message has Massed Into history, and still we are not happy. That Mr. Cleveland has evolved an able docu ment, his bitterest lualigners can hardly deny. His views on reciprocity must needs meet with thcapprobation of ail who understand the funda mental principles underlying that branch of political economy, while no advocate of Peace, with its attendant blessings, ean take issue with his ex pressions on the settlement of inter national boundary disputes. Regard ing the subject of the recent Chinese atrocities, committed upon American Missions, we enter a mild protest against the conciliatory tone of our Chief Executive's sentiments; still, none can doubt the soundness of his argument favoring tlrmncss tempered with gentleness, as well attested by the friendly attitude of that Power, and their ready co-operation in the punishment of the malefactors. Even the most belligerent defenders of our national rights will find solace in the vigorous language that demands pro tection for American fishermen in dis puted waters; likewise, sticklers for national precedents will derive much comfort from that portion of the mes sage which dwells in no uncertain tones upon our position in the Venezu elan Imbroglio. It will give pause to the insatiate British lion, now licking his chops in anticipation of the prom ised feast, while lovers of liberty and fair play the world over will applaud our stand. Lack of time and space forbids more than cursory allusion to many Important topics touched upon In this excellent Message; vide, the Hawaiian uprising, the Alaskan boun daries, the situation in the East, the Cuban rebellion, etc., etc. Ju treating of these all-absorbing subjects, Mr. Cleveland has evinced a masterly skill, and maintained hi high reputation as the true type of citizen, statesman and pati lot.. On the burning issue of tlnances, yclept "the money question," the President hits the nail squarely upon the head at every stroke, and we find it hard to realize that otherwise well meaning Democrats can doubt the soundness of his views. The fallacies of the Silvcrites and Inflationists are clearly exposed, and the strong light of reason thrown upon their specious arguments in a way to bewilder if not convert their most ardent champions. The catch-penny methods devised to capture the unwary arc described in all their hollowness, while the leaders in this misguided and unlucky cause, those who know the right and still pursue the wrong, come in for a cast! gation terrible to behold. To every "Doubling Thomas'' in the land, those animated by a sincere wish to absorb the undeflled truth, we earnestly com mend a prayerful and thoughtful perusal of that section of the Message relating to the financial question. This laudable .ask well performed, the ranks of the silver advocates will melt away as snow Hakes before the sun. Truly, we pity in our heart every deluded wanderer from the guiding-star of "Sound Money," so steadfastly kept in view, and so nobly defended by M r. Cleveland. Let them make baste in returning to the Fold ; grateful for the brevity of their alle giance to false idols, and wishing to expatiate the offence by future devo tion to a righteous cause. Col. P. K. Mayers, of the Pasca ooi'la Democ uat Stau, says his elec tion to the office of coroner was a joke put upon him by a few friends, and that he will not serve. Tube elected coroner is a grave joke, and the men who so wickedly behaved should be oflicially sat on. New Orleans Pica yune. M. A. Dees, member-elect of the Leg ilature from Harrison and Jackson counties, is writing himself to death in the public prints. Hazlehurst Courier.

"Before coming to qualify, which means taking the oath of olllce," says the Jackson correspondent of the Picayune Bureau, "it might be well for all ofllcers-elect. Slate, county, legislative and beat, to look up their tax receipts and ascertain if they have paid all their taxes for two years past before the 1st day of February. Only qualified electors are eligible to hold olllce in Mississippi, and to be a qualified elector one must have paid all his taxes us above indicated." Are your titles clear to olllce, ye re cently elected officials of Jackson county? The case of J. O. Williams vs. P. K. Mayers of the Desiocuat-Stau, for libel, has been continued in the Jackson circuit court unon the plea of the defendant. If we understand the case, Williams claims damages from Mavcrs because the latter charged Williams, through his paper, with having left without settling his board oil! ana wit ti being a nono. Ac cording to the Standard Dictionary, a houo is "an idle, shittless, wander ing workman, ranking scarcely above a tramp." Anil tnese charges, it seems, Is what lacerated Mr. Williams' sensibility to the amount of $10,000. But In all probability he will be food tor earthworms be I ore r. k. win un lock his triple-barred and hermetically sealed coffers and turn loose that much cold cash upon this uncharitable hem Isphere.

"Hello !" "This Is Mr. Pro Bono Publico. What do you think of the contem plated street railway from Seranton to Pascagoula?" "It impresses us as a most lauda ble enterprise, and one which should be encourged. Few measures would redound more to the benefit of both towns, and we sincerely hope the en prise will be carried out." "Exchange ! nimibcr 33, Dkmocuat- Stau ofliee 1 "Hello, is tbatCapt. Mayers? "Yes, sir." "An anxious citizen wishes to know when the new street lamps will be placed in position ?" "Great Scott! don't he read the paper? The contract, as we have stated before has been let for their erection. We learn that the posts are now being cut and the lights will soon be in position, burning brightly for the belated wayfarer." . "Hello, old reliable!" "All right." "I see by a recent paper that a wealthy delegation from the East is passing through the South with a view to selecting a suitable site for the location of a car manufactory. What's the matter with Seranton making an effurt to secure the enter prise ?" "Alas ! If the much-talked of young men's business league had been or ganized here, as we so persistently urged, their efforts in this matter would be invaluable. Such a move would add largely to our wealth, pop ulation and business. Perhaps we will wake up by the end of the next century." "Hello, Democrat-Stau! Don't you think it about time that more ef ficient service is being rendered at our postotlice, especially in the matter of more rapid distribution of the mail?" "We certainly do, and will mention the subject to the postmaster and see what can be done." "Hello, Demockat-Ktah !" "Go on, we are ready to listen." "This is Mr. Curio. I call your at tention to a notable phenomenon. There will be two full moons during this month, an occurrence sufficiently unusual to deserve mention." "tVehave made mention of it be fore, but a good thing can't be told too often. If the number of "lull men" this month could be limited to two, it would be cause for congratuhe lion, but considering the near ap proach of the holidays, such a con summation is hardly to be expected. We are loo full to say more," "Hello, Col. Mayers !" "Well, hello to you !" "A certain mutual friend bets me that you can't give the names of twen ty-flve different fishes off-hand. "Can't hey!
