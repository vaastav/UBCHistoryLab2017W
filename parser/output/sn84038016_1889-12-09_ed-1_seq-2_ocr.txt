It is a noteworthy faot, however, that they were not consumed by any particularly intense anxiety as to minority rights diring the sessions of the last Congress, It appears that fully CO per cent ot the shoe and leather industry in Lynn suffered heavily by the recent fire, There are but tew buildings left stand ing in the plaoe, suitable tor shoe manu faoturing, which are not already ooou pied tor that purpose. In consequence of this it is likely that a large number of the firms who were burned out will leave Lynn and seek accommodations elsewhere. The crippling efieots this great fire on the shoe industry will not be permanent; but the blow which it dealt to Lynn is one that will be felt for a long time. The Bureau of Statistics ot Labor . has oolleoted some figures about strikes that are .exceedingly interesting, and ought to be instructive to the persons moat concerned. During the year 1SS8 there were 1,021 strikes, in whioh 24, 054 persons were engaged, of whom 2.270 lost their Dlaoes permanently. Of the total number 489 strikes were "suo oessful." The amount of wages gained bv striking was $359.551 : the amount lost was $1,083.653 almost exactly three times the amount ot gain. There wage-earners. The New York Mail and Express says: Jeflerson Davis is dead. The rebellion whioh he led still lives in a large portion ot the country where he has been worshipped as the chief cham pion of the false dootrines that justified eoession as a "State's right." The form whioh the present rebellion takes is clearly desoribed by President Har rison and Attorney-General Miller in their references to the suppression or intimidation of the suffrage. A Repub lioan Congress will legislate fearlessly and efficiently for the maintenance of the Constitutional guarantees that were the price paid by the people of those States where armed rebellion had raged. for universal amnesty. And the Pres ident will enforoe this legislation with rigor and vigor and fearlessness." Senator Hals has introduced four bills whioh all relate to the navy. The first provides for the construction of eight battle ships of 7.500 tolO.CCO tans displacement, two armored coast de fense vessels, three gunboats ot about one thousand tons, and five torpedo boats. They may be built at the navy yards in case the Seoretary can not get them built by private firms at reasona Die price. The second bill relates to the naming of the vessels ot our navy. and merely puts into formal shap e the The rule already praotioally adopted. battle ships are to be called after States, like the Maine and Texas, now build ing; the cruisers after cities, like the Chioago, Atlanta and Boston, dow in commission ; the armored coast defense vessels after historic events or persons or plaoes, and the un armored ooasters after rivers. The third bill is of capital importance. The personnel ox tue navy is what makes it effeotive more than anything else; and this bill is intended to improve that, and more especially to provide a higher class of seamen. The term of enlist ment is enlarged, and special pay is given for long service. After thirty years of service seamen may be retired upon three-fourths pay. The fourth bill authorizes the Secretary ot the Navy to have steamships engaged in lake, coasting and foreign trade exam ined to ascertain their availability as cruisers in case of war. These bills exaotly embody the recommendations ot the Secretary of the Navy. xhebk are lew x.ngasa newspapers whose opinions about the message of a President entirely American in his 1 . : 1 . . pouucai economy ana general convic tions and ideas are worthy of attention ; but the London trott a remarks about President Harrison's message show such degree of fairness and appreciation standard of official oonduct la America is proverbially worthy of the republic s oriia as an oflsboot ot the first country where liberty was really established. and the calm and statesmanlike tone ot President Harrison's message is conclu- evidence that during his term m office he will endeavor to maintain tne best traditions ot Ameriaan diplomacy. unsullied by those temporary devioes which seem inevitable during election tim. It is not without a feeling of envy that the anxious and heavily bur dened slates of the old world contem plate the fortunate ciroumstanoes ot the int republic which has sr-rung up in the new." This an impartial tribute, all the more noticeable because the more im portant policies so dearly stated in the Message are distinctively opposed to English political eoonomy and English interests, and are regarded with un feigned apprehension by English and European statesmen. The possibilities of the movement tor closer relations between the North and South American oountries, under our leadership; the development ot our trade on this side ot the Atlantio, through subsidized steamer lines; the maintenance of our tariff system and the oreation of a great n4vy these are all prominent topios in the President's message, and they fore shadow the oommeroial independence of both Americas and the growth ot Americanism, with all that this implies, as a power to be respeoted by the whole world and silently lbflaenoing and revo lutionizing the rest of Christendom. 

MUSIC alE. Ufgant Kulrrlnluuirnl Ulyea by tba I iwrliuml Ifl u.le si Earlbara (Muardiijr MKbt. The department of music ot Eirlham college, under the management ot Mrs. Alice B. Finley. gave a reoital in Lind- ley Hall last Saturday evening. Many people lrom the neighborhood and city were oresent. and most tl the seats on the floor ot the hall and many in the gallery were taken. Muoh interest had been awakened as the time approached tor the first enter tainment under the skillful management ot the new mstruotor, Mrs. r inley, and it was a great compliment to the depart ment to be greeted with suoh a highly appreciative auiienoe. The program was opened by a piano duet from Weber, entitled Pol aoo a Brillante," rendered by Mrs. Finley and her sister. Miss Brown. This se lection was well reoeived and tully merited the hearty applause whioh was given, being a difficult eeleotion and sDlendidlv executed, Miss Delia Newsom came next with a beautiful soprano solo, "Tell Me. Baautilul Maiden." This seleotion was given in Miss Newsom's usually at traotive manner, and the audienoe showed their appreciation of the effort by encoring her. and she responded , with, another Deanxiiui selection., the auiienoe.

Xo the Editor of the Palladium : In the series of articles published in the Palladium, last Summer, under the general title ot "Larly Indiana, tne expression "Pioneer Period" was used in such ways as to convey the idea that the progress ot the State was diviaea or can be divided into different periods or stages. The time hen under consider ation au the brat utteen years touowidk Indiana s admission into tne union, id 1816. Those years partook ot ali the characteristics ot the conditions or stages in settlement ana imiuu"" n.n.llv Btvled "rioneer times, xne afclantion ot looations. the removal ot families thereto, the building of homes and the procuring ot the means ot living. were matters ot first importance, ran Hi. imnincAmonu were to some extent secondary considerations. J. he nrst tmht nt those tit teen years, were caneu ot "hard times." Afterward, aflairs be ?. n m to And i m mi?ratioQ waa re navari - larva tracts OI lana nau ueen . i , ii brought into market, and, by 1831, the people were more hopeful and began to contemplate great projects for public i m rii"fwm tan ta Before- continuing tne consideration nf avonta in the Period iuat now indi cated as opening about 1831, it will be well to consider the whole History oi .In diana with referenoe to the changes in the ohraoter ot events and in the con ditions of the region. divisions of Indiana's history. Th entire, hiatorv of the region now within the limits ot Indiana may be tiviil icto three arrest parts or epochs, each part marked by a diflereroi in the form and source oi government. ThA first cart may be called the "Col onial Epoch," and extends from the first visit ot white men in 1CC9, to the establishment ot territorial government in 1787. This part contains three re rioda: 1st. the Period of Frenoh Su nppminc. from 16t9 to 1763: 2d. the Period of British Supremaoy, from 1763 to (ootqaest by Amerman Drontiers men under Clark, in) 1779; 31, the Pe ri.vl while governed by V lrgima and olaimed by several States, until, being ceded to the general government, tern torial government was provided, irom 1779 to 1787. The second part may be called th "Territorial Epooh," extending lrom 1787 to 1816. This part contains two Periods: 1st. the time under the organ ization ot the Northwest Territory, from 1787 to 1800: 21 the Period ot the Ter ritorv ot Indiana, from 1800 to 1816 when Indisna beoame a State. The thirt part, following the manner ot designating the preoeding parts, may bo called the "State Epooh." It may be divided into Periods; and the first is the one already referred to and char aoterized as the "Pionr Period," ex tending from 1816 to 1831. With the latter date, great activity began to pre vail in Indiana, whioh seemed about entering a new era. Extensive interna improvements in canals and roads, were undertaken at public expense. The suooess ot the Erie Canal in New York had given a pattern and awakened en thusiaam. By the year 1837. the peopl began to feel the finanoial depression awasai'.:SMfca'"arf vriata; "a lnVo) veoTio a large amount. Until 1845 the reputa tion of the State was endangered, when by some measures ot compromise, its credit was saved. This Period may beamed the irenod ot Internal Im provements," beginning about 1831 and ending somewhere from 184o to 1843 The time from 1840 to 1845 was called "Dark days," from the finanoial troubles ot those years. .Beginning with tbe chances in the years 1816. 1847 and 1843. and extending to tne opening ot the Civil War, 1861, was a renoo wnicn may be named the 'Period ot Re-organizition." At first, it had been the policy to undertake the constructions ot roads and canals at public expense. I his policy resulted in disaster financially to the State and even to citizens. In the succeeding Period, the policy adopted was to leave the construction ot the larger and more expensive ot such works to associations ot men with money to invest in such en terprises. As the business aflairs ot the oountry began to revive, the people of Indiana began to renew their exertions to secure means of intercommunication but on the policy ot associated capital. Kailroads supplanted canals, and many companies tor their construction, and also companies tor the construction ot toll roads, were chartered in the lasti bait ot the forties and in the Fifties. ine state turned its attention to ednn uonai anairs. A law tor a school tax was submitted to the Deoc e in 1R4S and the subjeot was for several years me most prominent in state aft&ira The Institution tor the eduoation of the Deaf and Dumb was established in 1814; that for the Blind in 1847; and 1,? d i w K D"De' 00ntem: piatea since IsiiZ, but on account ol fi"noU1 cbsUole; not earlier es ab- tne nospitai tor tbe Insane, content lisbed, was ereoted in 1S46 and 1S47. the Bute Constitution adontad in 1S16. was regarded inadequate to the age of railroads, telegraph, tree sohools and improved machinery; and a new form was adopted in 1851. .New issues in national politics began to io finance the people, and in the midst ot lair prosperity, Indiana was called to take part in the war tor the Union. From what has been said, it will be seen that the Period iust considered, mn K designated as a "Period of fie organi sation." The "Period of the Civil W.f" from 1S61 to 165 inclusive need not be here desoribed. Following it, comes the present Period, which as yet we can not name with Doaitivene&a nn fully character! i a until we exDerienna some event that will mark its close; but which has already been a Period of marked progress in every respect mate rial, educational, and social The great wealth in tbe soil has been developed; that
