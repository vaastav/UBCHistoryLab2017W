DEW ELL, ntefedin the iostoffice at Pierfe, S. aft second class matter. The primary election law of V1 Wisconsin, passed by the, last scs gi011 of the legislature, and one of the championed measures of the Hon. Reform Masquerade LaFoi lelte, has, iu less than a year, been found tov be so full of holes that the governor, himself, has taken fright and convoked the solons in extraordinary session, to rectify, if he can, the mistakes committed, not only in the pri mary law but all of the other pel. measures. Now what do the in surgents of South Dakota think of that The Wisconsin primary law is a rank affair, but the pro posed measure that the insurgents of this state endeavored to force on the people, is even more rad ical. In the short time that is required to knock off twelve months of time it is demonstrated by the Wisconsin governor that vJPJ he legislature of South' Dakota r^Svas not only right but wise in re ":*futing to submit the proposed jjj^measuvc to a vole of the people, ^Jthereby saving thousands of dol lars of first cost, to say nothing of expense of a probable extra session of the legislature and a i.- ^resubmission, and nothing gained. MyThe insurgents will have to.put new catgut in the old fiddle The football season has closed, and well it may be. The game as now played in most cities and towns savors of the prize ring, and in many instances excells the fistic encounters for brutality. Each season increases the long list of deaths from accident or re sultant from blows purposely de livered ^y some member on a team. Young men are sent to educational institutions in pursuit of useful, elevating knowledge, not to train and cultivate the ani mal force which is born in every creature. The game is said to be high-class sport, witnessed by ».thousands, among whom are the i^olei'gv, educators, and the elete iMiaset, whose homes have been dark Ironed by untimely blotting out the a pronttising"lyoutig "man. An awakening is at hand. The ^foremost colleges ai placing a ban on the game and it is hoped that every institution of learning in the land will forever bar the diversion^! rThe only opposition to the re­ election of Congressman Burke next year that has developed any where in the state is in his home ilHtown, and from a little coterie of pot-house politicians whose am bitions are greater than their gratitude, whose selfishness is greater than their loyalty to the interests of their town and of the state. Mr. Burke belongs to the Estate and he cannot be retired at he behest of a few jealous ueigh ybors, none' of whom could till his •placfe in the national congress in H£a hundred years. It takes years service to command the influ ence that Mr. Burke controls in Ithji? national capital, even with a fyi"' |f|niart of bis ability. There are tW(f'idaily papers' published at ..an?l one, of thorn is op to Miv Burke just because W *le accomplished J§§i$! Ib^tQwn and state.

LaFollette £*W»!Hbroken 'sth$ silence as to to -opinion st-saetiseHkhan the -tail of a !ion» In the Badger state he appears to be held as a man of scintillation, and evidently prefers to be so considered while on the other hand should he become senator and go to Washington it is moie than likely he would develop into more shuck and nubbin. He may, however, be following the footprints of one David B. Hill, who, elected senator from New York, did not resign as governor to become senator until a month after the congress convened, ex pecting to make a grand entry into that august body. LaFol lette, like Senator Hill, has a presidential bee in his hat, but will, fike he, after a meteoric flight, sink into political oblivion. Ife second tiddler in Richard Pettigrew's orchestra, Hon. Coe I. Crawford, of insurgent-repub lican fame, accuses the railroad interests in the state of manipu lating conventions and legislatures of the state. Mr. Crawford hav ing tilled the office of attorney general of the state,.and having been the chief counsel of a lead ing railroad corporation in the state, ought to be consistent with his subject, but is he? The strange part of all this breeze stirring is that none of the so called misdeeds occurred while Coe-I. was in office, and ruling at will over the state on the now condemned passes. Naturally, after having been defeated for office these things loom into view, but not before. The voter will not take kindly to the present day manipulations of the insur gents' lieutenant. The congress is in session and Uncle Joe Cannon is speaker. The president's message, the long est. ever written by him, is brim full of sound conservative advice to the law-makers, and will be recorded in history as a great state paper. There are so many questions touched upon that their enumeration is forbidden. The leading topics are the railroads and rates, monopolies, foreign problems, the army and navy, immigration, the Panama canal, the civil service, and the urging of economy in the conduct of gov ernment business. The message furnishes the congress ample fuel for the session. --I aP k«« VA

Ci'S ron, ex-attorney general, ex-can didate for the nomination of gov vernor, was at Highmore one day last week instructing the peo ple, who are usually good listen ers and right voters. His address at the opera house was a rehash of the Huron-state-fair-speech, a denunciation of the honorable men whom he is pleased to term the machine,'' so-called,—for which his palm itches to be again a member,—a sarcastic criticism of the legislature, and a cry of disloyalty to Roosevelt's railroad rale policy. His argument, like a boy's old breeches, has shutters on the knees and windows in the a decision of the commis­ sioner of the general land office the fortunates in the Rosebud land lottery have received a severe jolt. It. seems that about all the home steaders who were holding down theft drawn claims through the summer and fall were seized with a desire for a leave of absence during the winter months, and so petitioned, but their applications homesteaders,' believing their re quest would le granted, departed for other climes, but are now compelled to return and maintain a continuous residence or forfeit theirclaim*. Mayor Ewert and the powers that be have put a ban on the slot mHohmes—a moral stroke in the night direction A Mitchell man, speaking of congressional timber, is reported as saying that in his opinion "if a congressman is big enoftgh and has influence enough to secure an appropriation for a $175,000 gov ernment building (for a fourth rate town—using his expression), every man in that town ought to support him." And this coming from a vanquished foe of last fall What think you, Mr. Dakotan Congressman Burke was among the first, after the organization of the lower house of congress, to be recognized to introduce-a bill for public buildings at Huron, Watertown, Mitchell, and Lead, to cost $175,000 each. President Roosevelt on Tuesday uoiniuattd and sent to the senate for confirmation, Captain Seth Bullock, of Deadwood, sheriff of Lawrence county, to be United States marshal of South Dakota. The long-drawn back biting con test between the two dailies lias developed into sort of "How Old is Ann*" problem. Nobody seems to know what the boys are. fussing about.. Common scolds—the insurgent. newspapers.
