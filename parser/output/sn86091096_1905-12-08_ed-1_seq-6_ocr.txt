DARK AS TO M08COW. Last News From There Is of Pillage and Arson. Berlin, Dec. 5.—Absence of news from Moscow leads to the worst con clusions in respect to that city's fate. The latest Information was that the old capital was in the hands of mobs that sacked and burned all the gov ernment buildings, and the police and Cossacks pillaged the Imperial gran eries and cut the telegraph wires. It is evident the last line of communica tion was severed at least 24 hours ago and that Moscow is isolated, not only from the world, but from the remain der of Russia. Honolulu Wants Laborers.

BALFOUR A ND CABIN ET RESIGN King Edward Accept» Seme end In struct» Campbell-Bannerman for Form New Cabinet. London, Deo 5.—The political crisis in the United Kingdom has reached a otimax Arthur J. Balfour, the pre mier, has formerly tendered the resig nations of himself and the members of his oabinet to King Edward,'who ac cepted them. His majesty has invited Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an interview, when he will offer him the mission of forming a new cabinet. Sir Henry will aooept the task, and within a few days a new government will be formed It may be stated as certain that Eord Rosebery will be entirely ingored in the makeup of the oabinet and that John Morley will be one of the ohief advisers of Sir Henry in drawing up the list of his official family, whioh will be presented to his majesty. Mr. Morley himself is considered like ly to go to the Indian office, aud it is probable that Herbert Henry Asquith will be ohanoellor of the exoheqner. The foreign afTairs portfolio will go either to Lord Elgin or Sir Edward Grey, though the latter is considered likely to be made secretary of the oolo nies. One thing is certain—that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has explained his atGtude on home rnle for Ireland to those liberal leaders who are known to be opposed to home rnle on the lines of the last bills introduced in parli»' ment. Sinoe his speeoh at Stirling, whioh raised snoh a fmore, Sir Henry has not made any statement, bnt it is confidently asserted in the liberal dubs that he is ready with a policy which will secure the adhesion of the British nationalists, and at the same time avoid raising the issue of one of the prominent planks in his platform. There is some uncertainty as to when the dissolution of parliament will be effective, bnt it is not considered prob able nntil after the new year. An interesting feature of the politi oal situation is the prospect of a doser alliance between the Irish and the labor parties in the new parliament. James Keir Hardie, the sooiaiist and independent member, in a political speech tonight frankly invited suoh an alliance. He pointed out that 46 labor members combined with 76 Irish mem bers would provide a voting strength which no government, however strong, oould afford to ignore. RECORD OF LIFE 8AVER8.

Wives and children of the entombed miners were among those who rushed the shaft, and the scenes there were most patuetlc. The men were ready enter the shaft.

The night force was small, their work being limited to knocking down coal to be taken eut by the day shift. Had the explosion occurred in daytime, the loss of life would have been far greater. The Diamond Coal & Coke company a Salt Lake o.ty concern. The out put of the mine is largely shipped to Salt Lake City and the smelters at Anaconda, Mont Many English miners, who came di rect to the mines from England, are employed in Diamondville, and it is believed tnat a majority of the dead are Englishmen.

ROOSEVELTS ADDRESS TO CONGRESS TOOK THREE HOURS. Rate Regulation Demands First Atten tion—Present Laws Ineffective—I More Money for Canal Work—Asks' . __.____ w , for Larger Navy-Revise Immigra-^ tion Laws—Change Land Laws. Washington, D. C.—At 11:40 Tues day morning assistant secretary to the president, Barnes, and executive Clerk Young and a messenger left the White a House bearing copies of the presi dent's message for reading in the house and senate and for distribution among the member. The reading of the message began 12:23, eight minutes later than in the senate. It required three hours to read. President's Message. To the Senate and House of Rep resentatives—The people of this coun try continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such prosperity, and this ebb and flow will be felt more or less by all members of the community, both by the deserving and undeserving. Against the wrath of the Lord the wis dom of man can not avail; in times flood or drought human ingenuity can but partially repair the disaster. general failure of crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-being, then those who are Innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the busi ness community would hurt the whole business community. But such stop page of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country the high individual character of the average American citizen, no mat ter whether his work be mental or manual, whether he -be farmer or wage-worker, business man or profes sional man. Talks on Corporations. Corporations are the first great sub ject dealt with. He says he is not opposed to corporations. Like trade unions they have come to stay. Each must be checked when they are not doing good. He thinks their regula tion possible under existing conditions but if not the constitution must be amended. The power to regulate must be affirmative and given to some ad ministrative body created by congress. He says such a body should have the power to judge of the reasonableness of a railroad rate and to prescribe the limit beyond which it shall be unlaw ful to go. All decisions on rates must be subject to revision by the courts. He does not favor power being given to originate rates, but to regulate rates already fixed. "I regard the power to establish maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform in the matter of railway regulation. All private car lines. Industrial roads, refrigerator charges, etc. should be controlled by the commis sion. Labor Question Taken Up. Again recommends compulsory use of block signals on interstate railroads and recommend regulation of hours of railroad workmen and the liability of employers for injuries. He says it would be unwise to deprive courts of power of Injunction in labor matters. Recommends thorough investigation of labor matters, child labor, healthy factories, reasonable hours. He recommends consideration of federal supervision of insurance. He says the needs and desires of the people should be consulted on tariff matters. Says economy in expenditures is ab solutely necessary this year. Advises the addition of the element of elastic ity to our currency. He wants better business methods in the various departments at Wash ington. Also recommends supervision of federal elections and campaign ex penditures. International Matters. The various matters affecting inter national law coming before the next Hague convention are discussed at length. He discussed the Monroe doc trine as an aid to the world peace and in this connection the San Domingoan situation. Canal Fund» Forthcoming. The Hepburn bill, appropriating $16,500,000 for the canal, will pass the house Thursday without reference to committee, either by .unanimous consent or by special rule. In this connection he also discussed the army and navy. He recommends general, maneuvers and promotions based on ability or seniority. He says increase the navy. Revision of the naturalization and criminal laws are recommended. He says public land laws should be changed to suit our needs today. He recommends to congress consid eration of the Mississippi levees, mer chant marine, Jamestown Tencennial, care of confederate soldiers' graves. He discusses at great length im migration and its evils and the neces sity ot the revision of present laws. He also considers the civil service and its needs, copyright laws, adulter ation of foods, smoke nuisance in Washington, and national parks, rec ommending an extension of Yellow to to stone Park south and east. Life sav ing stations and the Indians are also dealt with. He talks at length on the Philip ' pines, their improvement and needs. Says the most encouraging feature is increase of school children from 300, 000 to 500,000. He recommends free trade between the United States and the Philippines. He considers Porto Rico and insular affairs in general, Delegate for Alaska. He earnestly asks for an elective delegate for Alaska and recommends 0klahoma an(J Indlan Territory be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. He goes into canal affairs, but says he 'will" recommend type" at "a' later date. He finishes with the recommen dation for more adequate provision for the state department.

Despite all the denials at the meet;, ing of the American league In Chicago of any amalgamation between the Na tional and American leagues there are some of the magnates who honestly believe, that some such move will be made. It now looks as though Matty Fitz patrick would be the next match for Honey Melody. The Chicago boy has been trying to get a go with Gardner or Sullivan, but has about given up hope as the two latter men claim to be lightweights. Now Fitzpatrick comes out with the statement that he is after Mellody and wants to fight the Boston boy in San Francisco.

J.—Army 6, navy 6. While the army-navy football game Saturday was probably one ot the most exciting ever played between the two institutions, it was simply a side show to the social football event of the season. The 25,000 people saw the game. From all sectionttof'-the United States came spectators who or dinarily would not travel a score of miles to see a football contest. All this was doubtless brought about by the fact that President Roosevelt was to be present. Standing at end of Pacific coast league season: P. C.

Message Tuesday—Preliminary Work Only Will Occupy Attention for a Week—New Senators Appear—In Upper House There Will Be Four to Take the Oath. Very little besides the organization of the house will be accomplished the first week of the session, although it is possible that an emergency appro priation for the Panama canal may be passed the last ot the week.
