Reduction Sale Of 0xr Errtixe Stools of DEY GOODS! To Our Headers. For several weeks, as our subscribers are well aware, we have given the readers of the Weekly Kefdector but a scant amount of reading matter, owiDg to the advertising pressure upon our columns. In order to better ac commodate our readers we commence this week the regular issuing of a two page supplement, containing fourteen columns of reading matter. This makes the Weekly Reflector with its ten 7-column pages, 70 columns in all, the largest weekly ever issued in Dickinson county. It is only by reason of the unexam pled patronage accorded us that we are able to give this immense amount of reading for $1.50 per year. But our circulation, which is larger than that of any two papers in the county com bined, and our exceptional advertising patronage makes the additional outlay warrantable. Even with this addition to our space we are compelled this week to send out another supplement to accommodate advertisers. Subscribers to the Weekly Ee- flectob, the largest and beat weekly west of Topeka, who pay for one year in advance will have their subscriptions dated January 1st, 1889, and receive the DaDer from now until January 1st free. The President's Message. The President's message is before us. If we should say we had read the lengthy document it would tax the credulity of our readers. If Mr. Cleve land has not complied with all the requirements of the statutes in such cases made and provided it was not for the want of space. He thinks of lots more to talk about now than he did a year ago.. If a multiplicity of words, embracing a paucity of ideas indicates progress, then Mr. Cleveland has ad vanced since he wrote his free-trade message in 1887. It would be scarcely possible for a president, however much of a mediocre, to write a message as long as the one before us which should be wholly destitute of information. We have tried to separate the mes sage from the writer of it, and if possi ble judge of its merits from what it really contains. But it is to no purpose. The personnel of the President is so intimately impressed upon every origi nal sentence that it is impossible to read the message without seeing its author, and all the peculiarities of the man are before our eyes. Laying aside the disposition of the President to emphasize the fact that Grover Cleveland is President of the United States of North America, the message is thoroughly impregnant with what is known in psychological par lance as "sour grapes." There is nothing good, but every thing evil in the government. It is sinking into the vortex of ruin withl remarkable velocity. 'A century has passed. Our cities are the abiding places of wealth and luxury; our manufactures yield for tunes never dreamed of by the fathers of the Republic; our business men are madly striving in the race for riches; and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination in the magni tude of their undertakings." He views with pride and satisfaction the bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity in the past while only a closer scrutiny at the present develops a sombre shading, He sees the "health of the body politic" ruined and "selfish greed and avarice" take the place of "patriotic love of country." "Devotion of American citizenship for its own sake and for what it should accomplish as a motive to our Nation's advancement and the happiness of all our people is displaced by the assump tion that the government, instead of being the embodiment of equality,-is but an instrumentality through which especial and individual advantages are to be gained".

The President touches upon all ques tions likely to require the attention of Congress and he gives a great deal of valuable information ancUusefnl sug gestion which should be received and acted upon. Inasmuch as this is the last message, the valedictory as it were, of the great Democratic exhibition, it answers its purpose and it will go down in history as a fair expression of that party's opinion of itself and its ability to control the government in a manner satisfactory to the people. Nearly 8500,000 will be laid out in rebuilding Fort Eiley. It will be one of the finest reservations in the Nation when completed. President Cleveland should have confined his message to a plain state ment of the condition of the Govern ment in the past and present. The people have just decided that they do not go much on him or his party so far as the future is concerned. What with the Galloway circular and the blizzard-manufacturing correspon dents of eastern journals poor Kansas has a heavy load to carry. Mrs. Emma Malloy is in Kansas again. Say, Emma, you needn't come any further in this direction. Just "Whoa Emma!" as it were. The press of the Nation, irrespective of politics, agrees in one important par ticular regarding the message that it is unconscionably long and dreary. The Kepublicans, being practically sure of the House, have a great re sponsibility on their hands during the coming years. They have to shape the course of legislation and to do this in the face of the fact that it is always easier to sit back and find fault than to carry on the battle will be no easy task. that everyone has a hand in it. A ster ling character one who speaks for himself and speaks what he thinks is sure to have bitter enemies and warm friends; both are as necessary to him as fresh air; they keep him alive and active. Mr. Cleveland in his message refers to the Sackville West matter as follows: "Near the close of October last occur rences of a deeply regrettable nature were brought to my knowledge," etc. We don't doubt that the circumstance was "deeply regrettable" to Mr. Cleve land as it was one of the chief causes of his overwhelming defeat. The reports of the various Cabinet officers ought to be valuable articles. They have had excellent opportunities to learn something in the past three months. Old General Eice, of Ft. Scott, wants an omce. The many friends of the doughty old veteran will be glad to see him have it so far as he is concerned personally. "Tacky" is the latest slang. It means something which is ill-arranged, unbecoming or in bad taste. A would- be dude with too little sense to be dud- ish is "tacky." See? The Mormons are said to be getting numerous in Canada. This makes the outlook for annexation rather bright than otherwise. Getting annexed is the Mormons' favorite amusement. Physicians say that gum chewing "de- stroys female beauty. The gum habit drains the glands of moisture and makes plump and rosy cheeks impossi ble. This settles the gum question. A Vermont legislator has intro duced a bill providing for the fnrnish ing at public cost of suitable clothing for children who are unable to attend school for lack thereof.

Had this patriotic in junction controlled the acts of the Democratic party there would have been no President Cleveland. The basest kind of "discrimination in the treatment of the people" of the South made his elevation to the Presidency four years ago a possibility. The Charleston News and Courier mournfully confesses that there was too much South in Mr. Cleveland's administration. Not more than the South was entitled to from its political strength in the Democratic party and the electoral college, but decidedly more than the North was prepared to stomach. We are glad that this belated confession is made by so influential an organ of southern opinion. There has been too much South in Democratic legislation and administration. The Mills bill was a sectional measure. The Democratic party during the last four years has been led by the Solid South. Tribune. The above figures show that the Pro hibition party reached its greatest strength m 1886 and that it has so rap idly declined since that time that the column of losses from that year is nearly as formidable as the column which represents the vote of 1888. In a few States the Prohibitionists have made apparent gains, but as these are based upon their estimates rather than the official returns, it is not worth while to give them. The above facts show that the Prohi bition party is the strongest in off years when State issues are most prominent. That is, the prohibition element is.stronger as a State than as a Natior al party.
