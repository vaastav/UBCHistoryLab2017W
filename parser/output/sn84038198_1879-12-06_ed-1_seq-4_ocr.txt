rfHE Democrat SATURDAY- Uec.G. A J Ave 1*anther. One night of last week, while riding along the Kingwood and Tunnelton piko, going home after Court was over, and about S o'clock, Judge Shaw of the County Court was suddenly awakened from n reverio by his horse wanting to loave^the road, and go down the steep declivity to the loft. With considerable effort the Judge suc ceeded ir. keeping the animal in the way. When a few feet beyond the spot (which is two or three miles from Kingwood) the Judge heard a growl, and on looking back, lie saw crouched on a log, its eyes glaring in the moonlight, a live panther! It continued to growl for some lime?the Judge hearing it when oil* two or three hundred vards. He rode down to Mr. Trow bridge's who lived near, and in formed him of his adventure; when Mr. T. remarked that it was a pan ther, no doubt; and that it had frightened him a night or two be fore by its unearthly screams while lie was out in the woods, and, by following him, caused him to get home in haste, He had said noth ing about it to any one, for fear of being laughed at. It was a few days ago only that Mr. Richard Nugent, of this Dis trict, was followed by a nanthcr, ?while going home at night. Mr. Nugent had a lighted lantern and eomo bo close to him that ho could sue it by the light of his lantern. It# screams were unearthly?Mr. Nugent described them by saving they were "heart rending." At last lie throw a stone at it, and the pan ther leaped over a fence and ran awav. Mr. Nugent has no doubt about it being a panther as ho saw it plainly. A panther roamed about in this neighborhood for several wooks just before the War. It was seen by several persons, ami chas ed a Mr. Ilartman one night as he was going to Tunnelton. At length it was killed up in Lyon District. Panthers inhabit the mountain between Uniontown and Jlruceton in numbers and also abound in the Canaan country up in Tuekcr County. Following Cheat Uiver, they "pass and re-pass from the mountain to Canaan; and thus their appearance in this neighbor hood is accounted for.?King wood Juurnal. 1ho r resident'?

"It is understood in well-inform ed circles that tlio President begins his forthcoming annual message by congratulating Congress aiill the country up. ... the success accomplishment of resumption, but warns Congress that unless un limited coinage of standard ' dollars is stopped the present amount of gold' will soon heg.nl gradually to How out of tho coun try and that silver will take its, J,lace. On this point lie mends that no action he Ukui as to lixing the rati" between 'ho si ?, ver dollar and the gold dollar until j the international monetary Co - cress shall have arrived at sou Cj conclusion regarding the legitim.to status ofrflTt-r, but sugges s that, the coinage of the silver do l-ir merely suspended. It is aUo un. derstood that he takes the ground that as it is only in tunc o war or other pressing emergency that he issue of notes, the worth of which is fixed wholly by the government, is authorized, and that as no such emergency now exists, the circula ting notes, ?? '?> the greenback-, should now he retired in some manner wisely calculated to fore fend any disturbance of t,K!l,rJf' Bent financial equilibrium. to also argues that, as it has been the pulicv of the government ever siiiu the adoption of the constitution to pav otV all the debts as soon after thev am incurred as possible, a sinking fun.l should now be provid ed, or the existing laws relating to that fund amended so as toi fix limit specified and distinct ?>?"" which the present public debts shall be paid. He then recom mends that if the revenues of the, government shall not bo s - ficient to provide necessary funds to meet the demand of such a pol id a tariir should be placed on tea and coffee, as that tax could be conveniently levied, and would bo less felt bv the people than am ?l' 'Hc calls the especial attention of Congress to the continued and utter disregard of the gta'"tc8, against nolygamv bv tiie Pe?P'? the Territory of Utah, nnd suayst. or requests that soma action be ta ken in tho premises, lie rofeis to the fact that the lc?l!'rYVa > approaching the period when ? will apply lor admission into the Unioii, and when she will certain!} have to bo admitted as a Mate.

"He reports an agreeable ami friendlv state of-affairs with tor vigil nations and remarks m eh. et | that nothing of importanco has oc curred in diplomatic affairs sinco J his last massage. He discourages a renewal of the discussions regard ing the transfer of the Indian bu reau to the War Department, as that discussion always servos to hamper the ollicials of tho Italian bureau in pending operations and negotiations, and produces no cor responding good. As a member of tho Washington Monument com mission ho advises the appropria tion of a sufficient sum and the change of existing laws to permit the monument at an early date. "Referring to the 'deficiency which exists in the appropriation for the Department of Justice, lie points out the necessity of an im mediate appropriation for the pay ments of accrued dues and fees of United States marshals arising from the failure of Congress to pro vide at the late extra session for their payment under the usual pro cess. He further points out the necessity of similar or full appro priations for the faithful and com petent execution of the laws in the future. "In tone and spirit the en tire messago is conspicuously stal wart, as the phrase goes, so far as it relates to political affairs, and in length exceeds any of its prcdeees-1 sura.*'?Special to the Haiti more Sun. j Sever Say Die. We by no means give up the fight for* ISM). In the history of wars and parties many a victory has been snatched from oven great er reverses. The work to be done must be thorough?at once bold and usparing. Whilo the politi cians at Washington are wrangling among themselves, the people at home must organize. Needless baggage must be left behind. Wo can atlord to carry no dead weights. We must move up to tho front, pledging the country : 1. The maintenance of the public credit inviolato, and an honest ef fort to advance the prosperity of the people without disturbing the operation of the simple forces?to which we owe the present revival ?by experiments upon our fiscal system.

The resolutions mov ed by l'arnell and carried with en thusiasm, are to the effect that the arrests are arbitrary, unconstitu tional ami calculated to weaken the confidence of tho people of Ire land in the impartiality of the law, and that the government which squanders the blood and treasure of the people in unjust wars abroad whilo misery and famine aro uu mindod at home, stands condemn ed in tho eyes of all right-uiiuded and thoughtful men. Finnogan obstructionist member of Parliament for Innis, spoke strongly in denunciation of the gov ernment. There was no disturbance, as the authorities had taken great precau tions. Tho committee at a prior I meeting had issued an appeal to tho Irish to maintain a lirm but peaceful attitude. There was a torch-light proces sion, composed of four thousand persons, at Kelrush, coiintv Clare, : Ireland, last evening, which was witnessed bv an immense crowd, who cheered for the prisoners and O'Donovan Kossa.

Some of the experiences of voung women who lmvo been iirought to Montana in the capaci tv of servants have been very amu sing.

Governor Mathews lias been in vited by the Pittsburg Chamber of Commerce to address that body on the subject of the extension of the Pittsburg Southern Railroad through West Virginia, lie had expected to be present on Tuesday last, but a letter was rend before the Chamber explaining that en gagements would prevent him from complying with their request until after the lirst of January next. We are glad to learn* that Gov ernor Mathews has a full apprecia tion of the importance of this en terprise to the State of West Vir ginia. regarding it as the most material to the development of the State of any heretofore projected, and we have no doubt his influ ence at Pittsburgh will keep the boom booming at that point. We understand that he design?: giving a very full description of the terri tory and wealth of resources that woidd be opened up bv tho exten sion of this road. A full and fair presentation of this ought to be sullicient to enablo tho Pittslurgh ers to come right along with their "iron horso." 'We can feed him, even if we can't own him. And we hope to see many of our prominent citizens inking hold of this enter prise.? Wheeling Jteghler. Information has been received at Washington of an official charac ter that there will be two Territo ries knocking at the door for ad mission as States this winter. These are Dakotali and Utah. It is claimed that the population of each is sullicient. The Dakotains claim for their Territory a popula tion of 120,000. In 1870 it had 1-1,000. The increase has been tremendous, and there is now no doubt but what there will certainly he enough to make a State by the end of the present year. As to tho political complexion of these Ter ritories, Utah is Democratic while Dakota is Republican. A number of medical students in Indianapolis recently undertook to make a victim of a professional resurrectionist. They told him they had secured a body, and asked him to remove it from its hiding place. The supposed corpse in tho bag was a live medi cal student. The students pointed out where the bag was concealed, nnd the man threw the bag over his shoulder and set out for tho college. The corpse, with no knowledgo of his whereabouts, straightened out just as bis bearer was crossing the canal. With rare presence of mind the intended vic tim of tho joke heaved his burden over tho bridge into the water.
