And for thu privilege ) of In dulging this sentiment with tine Amuilcan enthusiasm , our cltlens are quite willlnc to foiego an idle surplus in the public tieasury , nnd all the people Know that thn averacn late of federal taxation upoi , impoits today , In time of peace , Is but Ilttlo less , while upon some articles ot necessaiy consumption , ills actually moie than was imposed by the urlovlous burden wllllngl ) borne at a time when the government needed millions to maintain by war the safety and integiltv of the United States. It Ins been thu policy of the government to collect thu ptliiclpil pirt of Its lovcuues by a tax upon Impoits , and no change in tills policy is desliable. Hut the presuiitcomlltlon of ailaiis eonstiains our people to deiinnd thai b ) a tcvlbion ot oui tevcnuo laws the 10- ceits ] of the goveinmcsit shall bo reduced to the necessaiy expense ot Us economic il ad- mlnlsliatlon , and this demand should bu rec- o/iu/cd iind obejed by the people's icpie- Hontativesin the Icgtalative branch of the gov ernment.

A reasonable and timely submission to such a demand should certainly be possible without disastrous shock to any inteiest , and a cheeiful conccssslon sometimes averts abiuptnnd heedless action , often the out- giowth of iiiipitlcnco and delayed justlco. Due reeard should be also accoidccl in any proposed readjustment to the Inteiest of Ameilcan labor so fat as they are Involved. We congratulate ourselves that there isamong UN no laboring class fixed within unviclding bounds and doomed under alt conditions to the ine.xoi.iblo lateotihily toll. Woiecosni/o in lubor a chief lactoi in thu wealth of thu lonublic and we treat those who have it in theh keening as cili/cns entitled to the mostcaieliil legauland thoughtful attention.
