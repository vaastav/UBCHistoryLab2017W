$ jp S?ljatan ani> ? oui brea. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5. The Sumter Watchman was founded in 1850 and the True Southron in 1866. The Watchman and Southron now has the combined circulation and influence of both of the old papers, and is mani? festly the best advertising medium in Sumter. THAT SPECIAL ELECTION. As will be seen by reference to oar advertising columns, an election bas bees ordered for January 9th, 1889, being Wednesday on the question of bonding the city to the extent of thirty thousand dollars, if so much be neces? sary, to establish aa electric light and waterworks plant. Voters must register between Deo. 10th and 24th, inclusive. No unreg? istered voter need apply. It ?hus appears that the people will be called upon to decide what must be regarded as a momentous question for the eity of Sumter. We have no satis* factory information, none that is decis? ive, to give our readers as to what such a plant will cost, but we presume that the City Council must be satisfied that it will not cost more than $30,000 for both purposes, or that sum would not have been mentioned. The gentleman who was here, Mr. Garden, gave those figures as approximating the cost, as we are informed. He afterwards with? drew his offer but that was only because he did not desire to keep it open for months, while the cost of material might be advanced meanwhile. So mueh on the general question. As to the election, as we look on it, the questions to be decided are these : 1. Are lights and waterworks need ed ? No two opinions ean exist on the j subject, from our point of view. The | present system of lighting, if it may be so called, costs in the neighborhood of $1800 a year. For $2500 electric lights, that will be lights indeed, can be procured. On this point, we may consult Greenville and Columbia, which have such a system in operation. As to waterworks, will any man un? dertake to say that we have an adequate supply of water now ? Vast sections of j the city are comparatively at the mercy of the fire fiend, and if we wish to know how the insurance men rate Sum- ! ter, in point of danger, just remember ' that from 4J to 6 per cent, is asked on property nearest the best water supply we have, and nearest to our steam fire engine. That tells the whole story in a sentence. Ten thousand dollars are paid out an? nually in this city for insurance. The cost would be reduced one-half if an ad? equate water supply existed. Had not that better be saved, even if a portion of it goes into the waterworks ? It is aa easy sum in arithmetic. A step like this, especially in view of the fact that this city is oo the eve of becoming one of the most important railway centres in the State, would be bound to attract the favorable notice of investors, and of persons seeking a place of residence. It cannot fail to advertise the city, and no one will deny that what we need is capital and popu? lation. In our opinion this is Sumter's golden opportuniny to leogtben ber cords and strengthen her stakes. A false economy now will retard the city's growth to an extent that wiU enable other competing towns to get ahead, and keep ahead of her. We must not forget that other towns are moving, and will move only the faster when they see Sumter standing still. We have lost ground already by our inactivity at critical times in our history. Let us not repeat the mistake, nor suffer the glittering generalities and the plethoric platitudes of the ever-cautious to make us shut the door in the face of the prog? ress that is knocking at iL If now de? nied, she may never return. 

POLITICAL BACK-PATTING. That portion of the fourth estate which hath its being at the North, and represents the. party of great moral ideas, has been considerably exercised of late in the effort to express its admi? ration of the grand character of the American body politic, which could go through the ordeal of a revolution such aa that which bas recently reinstated the Republican party in power, and yet possess the self-restraint to refrain from overmuch erowing on the part of the victors and an excess of kicking on the part of the vanquished. It is indeed a splendid example of the wonderful sta? bility of our young republic ; or at least that portion of it which lies to the South of Mason's and Dixon's line. Because, after ali, lo what a trilling ex? tent is the North affected by a change of administration ? Whichever party be in power, the North bas all the ben? efit and advantage of excellent and effi? cient and respectable Federal office? holders, but how about the South? What guaranty have we that our offices will not be filled with all the broken c ?wu political hacks and offensive par? tisans who lorded it over ns in the olden time ? If there is any portion of the country that is excusable for kick? ing, it is the South. AU the recon? struction, all the financial, industrial and political crises and revolutions that have swept over the country since 1865, have taken effect almost altogether at the South. AU the woes and sorrows engendered thereby, all the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, have been the portion of the Southern people. The war period and the period suc? ceeding it were times of unexampled prosperity to the North, while of the Svuth it can be truly said that nothing bat the indomitable pluck of ber peo] aided by ber matchless climate and i tile soil, baye enabled ber to take rank she bas and command the resp of the world, and even draw cap from abroad which gladly seeks invt ment here. And she bas done it in the face partisan lies innumerable, and frat waving of the incarnadined underve and persistent misrepresentation by t same complacent press of the Nor The South owes the Northern Kept Hean press nothing, nor does she t anything of it now.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAG1 We have risen from a perusal of tl President's Message with fresh and it creased admiration of his ability ac patriotism. After reminding Congress that t\ country has passed the first century < its constitutional existence, the Pres debt points out the fact that of lal years there has been a wide departut from the safeguards which the Const tntion throws around the citizen, au shows that in so far as we depart froi the provisions of that instrument, ot republic, as such, is a failure. H urges that private interests should t subordinated to public interests, an Congress should legislate on patriot! rather than on selfish consid?ration! He gives examples of what he meac when he cites the fact that the bill fe the relief of the Supreme Court hs failed to pass, while numerous acts of private nature have been pusbe through. He attacks boldly the syi tem of taxation which extorts io a fe' years two hundred millions of dollar more than are needed io pay all es penses of the government, and show bow the same grasping spirit that foe ters such an infamous system, is pre docing the immense monopolies whic now threaten to oppress the people He urges revision of this matter, show the bearing of tariff reform on it, an also advises earnestly a revision of th existing wretched pension laws. He refers to the fisheries questioi aud the Sackville episode in a prope and becoming manner. He shows hoi we are at peace with all the world that our navy is being put in fine COD dition ; that the postal service is bette than ever: *he department of agrien! ture is doiog good work, aud that in al respects the country is exceedingl prosperous. Mr. Cleveland's sturdy manhood am hatred of cant and hypocrisy stand ou in fine relief in hts message. No Pres ide nt has ever been manlier than he and h i3 successor will be compelled t act up to a high standard unless he de sires to see himself in painful contras with him when about to lay down hi trust with the entire respect alike o political friends and foes.

WASHINGTON LETTER. WASHINGTON. I). C., Nov. 30, 1888. Mr. Cleveland's last annual uiessag? to Congress is all complete, and hai been submitted to bis cabinet at a meet ing called for the purpose, but what i ti contents are, nobody outside knows, ot is likely to know until the document ii read at thc Capitol Monday. The mern bers of the cabinet will only say that ii is a very strong and interesting docu muent, and that it will be well worth) of a place along with the other statt papers which Mr. Cleveland has written. Speaking of this message reminds mc that Mr. Cleveland has bren particu? larly fortunate in never having had auv 'leaks' in bis administration through which public documents, such as pres? idential messages, have reached the public prematurely. His is the first administration for many years entirely free of these 'leaks.' On the eve of the first Thanksgiving day after Secretary Whitney took charge of the Navy Department, he in? augurated the pretty custom of present iog each one of the four hundred i ployees of that department with a fat turkey. The custom has been r ulariy kept up ever since, and 1 Wednesday the employees of that partment received for the last time t practical evidence of the Secretary's terest in their welfare This year Pc master General Dickinson followed good example set by Secretary WI ney, and presented each of the empl< ees of his department with the fin turkey to be had. These turkeys w< greatly enjoyed. It is extremely don ful whether the new Secretary of I Navy and Postmaster General will ? low the excellent example set them the Democratic officials. Believing in the old adage that M early bird catches the worm,* Represe tative Cannon, of Rlinois, has opec headquarters here and begun an acti canvass for the Speakership of the n* House of Representatives. Mess Butterworth, McKinley, Burrows, Re and company, will however make t fight interesting as soon as they { here. It is generally thought tl either Reed or McKinley will Speaker. Democratic members of Congress a as a rule extremely reticent as to wfa line of policy they will adopt at t coming session of Congress ; they neai all express a desire to confer with th? Democratic colleagues before comm ting themselves. An exception to tl rule is Representative Springer, of II! nois. He insists that one of the fit things thc House will do will be to pa his Oklahoma bill, and that the ne thing will be to pass a bill for the a* rr ittance of at least four Territories in the Union as States. The clerks in the Government d partment in this city below the grade chief are all in an easy state of mir: just at present. They have becon convinced that Harrison is a genuii civil service reformer, and that thei will be no clean sweep when be com? in. The principal cause of this beli was an article in our local papers, take from the editorial columns of the Ind anapolis Journal, a paper which thought to be Harrison's home orgai which warned the republicans not l expect a 'clean sweep.' There ma not be a clean sweep, but in my opie ion at the close of Harrison's term thei will not be one democrat in office hei for each ten republicans now drawin Uncle Sam's pay. In other words, don't believe that Harrison will kee one tenth as many democrsts in offic as Mr. Cleveland has kept republican: Harrison's Southern policy continue to be a subject of general discussio here. The opinion is almost ucanimou amoog the members of both partier that Harrison's administration will b a very conservative one unless some thing now entirely unexpected sh oui occur. ? don't think the South ha anything to fear at the hands of Hai rison. If many things that now bav a somewhat troublesome look are le severely alone, they will adjust them selves; chief among this class of thing is the negro question. I am certaii from information d?riv?e from repub Hean sources, that Harrison will appoin no negro to any prominent federa office in the South. In fact there i an undoubted- disposition among repub Heans to relegate the negro to bael seats in future. He is no longer o any practical nse to that party, there fore they will give him nothing. When Congress opens Monday it i doubtful whether either House will havi a quorum present, unless they come ii much faster to-morrow and Sunday There is a growing belief that Har rison will call an extra session of Con gress sooD after his Inauguration.
