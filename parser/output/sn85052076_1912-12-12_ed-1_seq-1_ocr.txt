KENTUCKY WORLD NEWS Fighting 'Over In Balklns Peace En voys to Meet In London Corean Plotters on Trial Railroad Str.ke In England Presidential Election In France FIGHTING CEASES IN I1ALKAN3 Tho Balkan situation has Improved greatly during Uio last week. Forty eight hourc after tho three nllleo signed tho armlutlce, tho Greek re presentative signed also. The terms of tho armistice are as follows: 1st, that tho armies maintain their res-IK-ctfvo positions; 2nd, tho besieged Turkish fortresses snail not bo re- vlctualed; 3rd, tho llulgarlan army bhall bo rcvlctualed In the field by way of tho lllack Sea; 4th, negotn- lions for peace shall begin In lndon, tho 13th. Tho relations between Servla nnd Austria which threatened to Involve all EuroKi continued strained for several days but aro relieved now by tho fact that both governments have consented to leave their differences to .i conference of the Powers which meets In Loudon simultaneously with tho ienco envoys. Ixiudon U making preparations for tho two great conferences, tho King having turned over St. James Pal ace for tho use of the foreign rep resentatives. Tho proceedings will be similar to those at Portsmouth, X. II., which brought peace between Rua ln ami Japan seven years ngo. It Is expected and rnther feared that tho TurkB will bo more ioverful In tho peace conference than on the field of battle as the Rusalaus were. And tho hope that tho Turks might bo driven out of Euroio entirely, although by tho thousands they aro already taking their flight owing to tho fear of their enemtea nnd tho greater enemy, cholera, seems to be vanishing. PI.OTTERS ON TRIAL Tho 100 Koreans, charged with con bplrlug agalust tho life of the Jnpnn eso Governor General, nro on trial In Seoul. It Is said that no religious feeling or prejudlco has shown itself In the matter, although many of tho plot ters In their tettlmony hnvo reflect ed upon tho Christians and credited their plotting to their Influence. ANOTHER ENGLISH STRIKE Three thousand English railroad engineers aro roported to have gone on n strlko becnuBo ono of their number, convicted of drunkenness while off duty, wns assigned to n lower grado of work, running a pilot engine Such Is tho perversity of tho lalwr world, labor unions usually losing tho sympathy of the masses by espous ing unjust causes. FRENCH TO ELECT PRESIDENT Tho French will elect n President Jnn. 17th, it being an entirely dif ferent election from ours, however, tho peoplo taking but very llttlo note of the ev.ent Inasmuch as they hae no cholco In tho matter, the Presi dent being elected by tho ChambT of Deputies. Tho foremost raudldato Is tho President of tho Chamber, J'atil IVschanel. Hero nro two pictures ono is of n man, tho other n woman, Look nt them carefully study their fenturea. It will not requiro any (front effort to recognize them. The iiihii is a husband or father or both. Ho In morose, or crab bed, exacting nnd unsympathetic; ho is downhearted registers the day's trials on his evening fnce; instead of sunshine nnd cheer ho brings n storm cloud nnd shadow into the home. He is oblivion of I lie present's splendid opjHniuuity to play the man, but thinks, of course, of himself us n hero if lie lind oidy been enst upon different times. He has lost the heart of n child nnd purity and tenderness nro nenrly forgotten. As n consequenco, these virtues lire repelled in his children, Heady, still, to place his life between them nnd physi cal danger or injury, he is forgetful of the fact that ho himself is tho most dangerous foo to their well being. He Is not quitting himself like a man. He is not living "game." Now look nt the woman. She is a wife and mother. She is impatient, indulgent, indifferent and extravagant. She is slothful and untidy. Tenderness and sympathy are gradually fading out of her life. She is desondeut nnd constantly bownils her sud lot, failing to look at herself to sec the cause. She also paints glowing piettires of what she would have been might have been under other circumstances, forgetful that one's worth is best tested by the obstacles overcome; that she is tho greatest heroine that best masters her own temperament nnd disposition nnd properly governs her home. And ihero are other pictures little faces. What they might have been they are not. Wo withhold them from view because they have been so marred by the background father nnd mother. The man who does a credit business is building his house upon saiul. Even those whom ho credits, and sometimes goes out of the way to favor, nro apt to respect him less in the long run than they do the man whose business is on a cash basis and he respects him self less. The President's Messages President Taft Is again followlns his custom of submitting suveral short messages Instead of one comprehen sive one. He has already sent in two, ono on Tuifcday, tho second day f tho session, and the other on the Friday following. Tho first mcssago was given up al most exclusively to tho foreign rela tions of our government, the Presi dent going into detail aB to our diplo matic and consular service, and show ing In what resMct8 there has been Improvement, For Instance, tho ser vice has been largely reorganized and placed on a merit basis and diplomacy has been used In trade promotion. At tention Is called to tho great in crease In our export trade which tho President saye vindicates what his opponents have derisively named "dollar diplomacy," which ho Justi fies by saying that "dollar diplomacy'' Is better than "bullet diplomacy." The message spcakB of our rela tions being friendly with foreign governments, emission being made of tho estrangement with Russia ow ing to tho passport controversy and the abrogation of our treaty with that country.

JUSTUS GOEBEL'S PRESJMITH Quotes Smith's Sworn State- ment In Court as Proof That L. & N. lluS Evaded Tax- atlon. Prsr.kfort. Ky. (Special.) In an pen letter to the press, Justus Dos sil replies to the recent letter of President Milton II. Smith, ot the L. A N., In which Mr. Smith discussed the stseument of the L. & N. for franeh'. tax purposes for 1912. Mr. oaebe says: "In the light ot the facts which re late to and upon which the 1912 as Mitmtnt ot the L. A N. railroad's franchise was based, and referring to what has heretofore been made pub II o touching the assessments of that company's property In past years, vita all of which facts President Smith was well acquainted, his letter can only be regarded as an attempt on hli part at perversion ot the truth for the purpose of misleading and de ceiving the public at large. "He Is merely attempting to gala sympathy when he says 'this addi tion! burden Is on our franchise alone r for the privilege of doing business.' "I deny that the L. & N. has ever paid one dollar In taxea on 'the priv ilege of doing builneis' In Kentucky for the reaaon that said company has not to date paid taxes on an amouat In anything like the value of Its actual tangible property. President Smith ays In his letter that there Is no con troversy respecting the aneisment ot the tangible property of hli railroad company. partment which wan covered In the first message, A notable paragraph is the Presi dent's reference to the tariff. No recommendations aro mado whatever, for tho reason, as he says, thnt, "The new Congress has been elected on n platform of tariff for revenue only, rather than a protective tariff and Is to revise tho tarlft on that basis, and for me to present arguments or re commendations In favor of a protect ive tariff would me needless.' The message) also declares that no radical chango Is needed In tho Sher man Anti-trust Law, and, referring to tho Panama Canal, expresses tho be lief that It will be open the latter part of 1913. Possibly the most notable feature of tho message Is the President's re ferencc to tho Philippines and the statement that autonomy ought o he proclaimed at once and Indepen dence In eight years. A notable sentence In this argu ment Is the following, "We are seek ing to arouse a national spirit, and not, as under the old colonial theory, to suppress such a spirit. Hut our work Is far from done. Our duty to the Filipinos Is far from discharg ed." 

REPLY TO OF THE L&OY, Ask That Public Ba Given the Wholi Truth Reading Real Value ot the L. & N. Rail way Property. Tangible Preperty, "Permit me, please, to say that taere never will be a controversy with reference to the assessments of the tangible property of hli railroad com pany io lor as his company, and his and Its confederates In this litigation. as In the past, continue to control the action ot the Kentucky Railroad Com- minion In fixing the values of their tangible property for taxation. "The Board of Valuation and Aneie ment Is called a 'franchise board,' but li In reality and affect a revisory board, having to do among other things with the work of asseiiment done by the Railroad Commlislon. It can not, In so far as the aliened val uation of tangible property li con cernrd, correct or undo what the nail' road Commission has done. That the State Hoard of Valuation and Alien ment was not again this year con trolled by the railroad companies agathat the Interests of the people was not because the attempt was not made. Mr. 8mlth's Claim. "President Smith says that 'for the pursoi of being operated as a carrier of freight and passengers,' all of the L. N. rallroad't property In Ken lucky all of Its tangible property In Kentucky Is aliened at Iti full value or more and taxes paid thereon. Let's tee whether or not such Is the truth.

MOOSERS IN CONFERENCE A big gathering of tho Progressives was held in Chicago, Tuesday and Wednesday, of this week. Ex-Presi- dent Roosevelt and a good delegation from the East made their wny to the convention city and all parts of tho country were represented. The purpose of tho meetng was to ds cuss plans for the future of tho new- party. A WISE COURSE Republican leaders In Washington havo decided to take no active steps toward a reorganzaton of tho Repub lcan party for a year at least.
