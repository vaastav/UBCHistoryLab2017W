&bf Sbtpbtrbstoton Stqistnr. H. L. SNYDER, Editor and Proprietor, Shkphkrdstown*. W. Va. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1889. Jkffkrsox Davis is very ill, and it is evident that his days are numbered. COXURKSS has commenced its ses sion. but who can say where it will end! Thk office- seeker is swooping down on the Congressman like a wolf on the fold. Notwithstanding the great quan tity of foul weather this fall, turkeys are scarce and chickens high. Thk Democrats made a pretty fair start in Congress by electing one offi cer of the House? the Chaplain. This lias been a wet year, but Bos ton and Lynn have suffered more from the opposite element than they have from water. Thkrk has been no relative of the President appointed to office this week yet? probably waiting for some of them to grow up. All the Democrat!" Congressmen from West Virginia whose seat* are conte>t??d were sworn in without any di>turhance on Monday. It is believed by many that Hon. Samuel J. Randall will never recover from his present illne>s. He has not been able to appear in Congres.- yet. A t( 

LORKI) woman has been ap pointed postmistress at Eola. in Lou i>iana. and the people of that com munity are raiding a big row about it. Thkrk is one consolation, anyhow ?if Congress shall follow the Repub lican idea a- to pensions there need be no fear of extravagance in any other direction. Thk Republican majority in Con gre-;. ha? but a Reed to depend upon, though, fortunately for them, it i? a very stout one. Nevertheless it may I be broken before winder is over. This Congress should not go too far into investigating committees. it i? a kind of work that costs much and results in little. ? Baltimore American, j Dox't want your party found out. i It is now said that the gubernato rial contest committee will have its report ready next we^k. They say | the report will be very exhaustive? probably to correspond with the ex- j hausted state of the public. A BLOODTHIRSTY mob in W isconsin j laj-t week lynched a poor insane man j in the most fiendish manner siuiply ; because they wanted to get rid of ! hiin. Northern papers will please I note that this outrage was not com mitted in the South. Wk take pleasure in noting the election of Mr. Charles W. Adams, of Sharpsburg. as doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. We know of no Republican whose success in this connection it would give us more pleasure to record, and there is ; no doubt that he will prove a eapa- ! ble and trustworthy official. Evkn the Republican leaders are j beginning to sp^ak in favor of a re- i vision of tariff, and they say a tariff bill will be passed by the present Congress. But the country wants a tariff bill formed by the friends of j the laboring people and the consu- i mers. not by the colleague? of the rich manufacturers and monopo- , lists. The other day a delegation waited on the Postmaster-General to urge the appointment of a certain gentle man for postmaster at Baltimore. , They described in glowing terms his I many good points as a (j. A. R. man and went intoecatacies over his record as a political manager. Then they gracefully bowed themaelver away without having said a word as to his business qualifications. Compared with the original, cour- i ageous and interesting state papers of Mr. Cleveland, President Harrison's ! message isa fiat failure. There is no ringing declaration for the welfare of the people, no bold stand against : the many corporate evils and trusts that imperil our free institutions, j Like the author, the message is nar row and partisan, and elicits nospark of admiration from even his party as sociates. 

COSGRKSS was formally opened on Monday last. Vice-President Morton presided in the Senate, where little business was done except to swear in the new Senators from the recently I adiuitted States. Mr. Reed, of Maine, "was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives by the Republicans, the Democrats casting their votes for Mr. Carlisle. The Republicans elect ed their caucus nominee for clerk Edward Mcpherson, of Pennsylvania; A. J. Holmes, of Iowa, Sergeant-at. arms; and Charles W. Adams, of Mary land, door keeper. Several Republi can members bolted the caucus nom inee for chaplain, and Rev. Mr. Mil bum, the blind preacher, was elected. Thk Chariest own Spirit of Tuesday ?ays: Our brethren of the Republi can household of faith had a meet ing in the court-bouse at this place last Saturday. It purported to be an Executive Committee meeting, but as to what it really was a Kilkenny cat fight was nowhere? if what we learn about it be true; and our infor mation is from a source not to be doubted. In addition to squabbles about other matters. Col. Black and Jas. D. Butt. Esq., claimed in be half of the colored voters of the party that as that element largely prepon derated in its strength, it should be represented irksome degree at least in its benefits? *. that all the appoint ments should not be given to the small minority of the party in this county, and the great majority left entirely out in the cold, without a single sop to soothe its hunjrry maw. If this practice was to continue, it was asserted, Jefferson county would at the next election give two thousand Democratic majority. The colored brother was again, nevertheless, left out in the cold, and his enthusiasm for the g. o. p. fs reported on the wane. The President's Massage. The President's message to Congress is admirable in form and comprehen sive in scope, referring in dignified and well-CDOsen phraser to all- the topics of domestic and foreign con cern that now occupy the public mind. In substance it is, for the most part, a paraphrase of the Chicago platform. Protective tariff views are presented in uncom promising language, and a strengthen ing of the strong arm of the federal government, with the object of con trolling Southern elections, is urged with partisan zeal. The mes sage opens with the usual review of our foreign relations, which are de scribed as in all cases amicable and cordial. The presence at Washington at our invitation of representatives of thirty-three nations iu attendance upon the meetings of the Maritime aud Pan-American Conferences is ap propriately recognized. Canada's conduct toward our fishermen dur ing the past year is referred to in complimentary terms, and it is recom mended that * a treaty with Great Britain, enlarging the list of extradi- 1 table offenses, be ratified. This changed attitude since the republi can party's acquisition of power is emphasized by further recommenda tions looking to more harmoniuus re lations with our northern neighlor. j Claims of our citizens in Peru and at Lisbou are mentioned as having the strong sympathy of the administra- j tiou. The important announcement is made that our recognition of the Brazilian republic is to be deferred until the majority of the people of Brazil shall have signified their assent to its establishment. Returning within the sphere of domestic con- : Cerns, the President finds a general ; condition of prosperity prevailing in the United .States. The excess of re ceipts ever expenditure.- in the pa-t ; fiscal year, after provision for the | sinking fund, was $57,470,129. In the present fiscal year the estimated sur plus is ?-13.678.883. In the fiscal year , ending June 30, 1881, there will be, it : is estimated, a surplus of receipts | over expenditures of $43,569,522, with | a prospect of even larger figures, j This actual and prospective excess of receipt.- requires, sa\ s tiie President, "the attention of ? 'ongres.-, with a view to reducing the receipts of the treasury to the needs of the govern ment.*" A reduction of taxation is not ur.'ed. as it is practicable to "re- | du<-e receipts" by increasing tariff ; taxes to the point" of prohibiting im- j ports that compete with our favored ludu-tries. Tlie President does not | adopt Mr. Cleveland's phrase. "L'n- I necessary taxation is unjust taxation." j but puts it more mildly. "The collec tion of moneys not needed imposes." | he says, "an unnecessary burden." j A change in his opinion as to the proper use to be made of treasury surpluses is manifested in the state ment of his message that "we should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our bonds." During the presidential campaign of 1888 he held in numerous speeches that the purchase of bond- with the surplus was the best possible use to be made of the money, and that a reduction of taxation" was therefore entirely unnecessary. Mr. Cleveland's device to put the money raised by unneces sary taxes back into circulation by loaning it to the banks in various sections of the country Mr. Harrison j still condemns, though he does not ; tell how, in default of 4 'anticipating ' our bonds," a dearth of circulation ' was to be averted. The deposits still ; with the banks, after so long an in terval, will accordingly, it is announ ced, be gradually withdrawn. To "re duce receipt.-." the President recom mends "a revision of the tariff law, both in its administrative features and in its schedules." It does not appear that he favors a reduction of tariff taxes. "The inequalities of the law," he -avs. "should be adjusted, but the protective principle should be maintained." There shouldbe.it seems, a leveling up rather than a cutting down of taxes. Tin-plate, j wool aud woolens, for example, pre- j sent "inequalities." according to pro I teciionist views, by being taxed too 1 little under the existing tariff. The specific changes recommended are an ! extension of the free list by putting | on it classes of articles not made in | the country, and the removal of the internal tax on tobacco aud on whis ky used in the arts. With respect to silver the President i- rather non-committal. He affirms that no harm has come of the larire coinage of silver dollars since 1878. but thinks "we should not tread the i dangerous edge" of the peril that j may come of "any considerable in- j crease of the present rate of coinage." Upon the whole, however, he is dis- i posed to think favorable of Secretary Window's plan for the issuance of cer- ! tificates upon the deposit of silver bul- ! lion at its market value. The Presi dent is evidently indispo-ed to "tread the dangerous edge"' in politics by taking a decided course on a question having so equivocal a future. He is more explicitly favorable to a large appropriation for forts, ships and guns and for the improvement of our rivers and harbors. A few large work- at a time is, he thinks the wiser plan. The question of drastic legisla nun ior lue ouuni is approacueu through a recommendation. suggest ed by the Terry-Field case, that fed eral officials be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the States courts. "Events." he continues, "happening in other parts of the country" suggest that law* should be passed to protect witnesses from intimidation or from injury on account of their testimony in the United States courts. The *-a crwdness of government officials here proposed and contempt of local opin ion of witnesses would be approved doubtless by the present regime in Ireland, but we can hardly desire that a section of this country of the extent of the South should be con verted for party purposes into anoth er Ireland. Such unquestionably would be the result of the legislation the President recommends in a truc ulent tone for the supervision and con trol of elections in South. The color ed population of that section, he al leges, is "deprived of any effective ex ercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights." This is in ferred, it appears, from the fact that the negro of the South does not send republican representatives to Con gress to support theprotective policy. This neglect on his part the President terms a "flagrant evil," calls it a "prob lem," and a>ks rhetorically "when is , he to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law?" Con gress is "earnestly invoked" to use its powers "wisely but firuilv" to protect the colored man "in all his relations to the federal governient, whether as litigant, juror, witness, elector for members of Congress or as a traveler on our interstate railways." From the bloody shirt question the message proceeds to the question of subsidies, and it is recommended that such ap propriations be made for ocean mail service in America, China and Japan | "as will be liberally remunerative" and "will encourage" American ship owners. To aid further this artificial stimulus to our steamships, as against oursailingships.it is proposed that we shall also give a subsidy to all steamers constructed in such a man ner that in case of war they can be 1 converted into cruisers. Other meas ures recommended to the favor of Congress are the Blair education bill, the civil-service commission's appeal for more clerks, an appropriation to promote the world's fair of 189-?, a sep aration of the weather service from the War Department and its incorpo ration with the Agricultural Depart ment, a bill to pension every ex-soldier who is dependent on his exertions for support and is for any reason unable to earn it, a territorial government for Oklahoma, and an investigation i into the jurisdiction of the federal I government in relation to trusts. It is also recommended that intermed iate courts having final appellate jur isdiction of certain classes of cases be created for the rel'ef of the Supreme Court, which is now overwhelmed with business. The message is. upon the whole, a clear and concise discus sion of the matters treated, but of the breadth of view and national spirit it betrays the less said, perhaps, the bet ter. - Baltimore Sun.
