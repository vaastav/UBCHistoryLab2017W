For President. GEN. ULYSSES S. GRANT. For Vice-President, GEN. JAMES A. GARFIELD. Mr. Hamilton, Superintew. ent cf the Ieetooim Kail Company, died 0 small pox, on Ust Sunday morning. 41 Mohawk, Jr.," a young trotter, was told in Cincinnati on Monday for $20,000. J. X. Cowley, of 5few York, was the purchaser. The number of deaths from small-pox in Philadelphia during the week ending at noon Saturday was one hundred and fifty -three, A man was killed by cars on the Ft Wayne road at Leetonia, last Thursday. He was on the track and did not observe the train until it was on bim. During the month of October the rail roads having their termini, in Chicago, with a single exception, not only suffered no loss, but earned nearly f 200, 000 more than fn the corresponding month of last year. Congress assembled on Monday. The President's annual message was read at 2 p.m. It is pronounced by the press to be an able and interesting document. We will publish it in our next issue, its length, as well as the hour in which we . received it, rendering it inconvenient for us to reproduce it in onr columns this week. Montgomery and Frank Blair have put forth deliverances on. the subject of the Presidency and the Democratic party. They sound like testimony of , the nearest surviving relatives before a coroner's jury. The Blairs give up ' entirely,' not 'being able to perceive ' single ray of hope for the Democratic party. The excitement in Clark county, In- " diana, on account of the Park tragedy, has not died out The suspicion that white men Instigated the murders is undergoing a secret investigation. A - number of negroes are leaving the county. The wife of the negro, Taylor, - who is now suspected of being the one ' who struck the fiendish blows, has gone . to Chicago.' The grand jury will meet , in December, when it is probable that some of the lynchers of the negroes ttnraeed in the bloodv affair will be indicted. " We last week named the ticket that we should prefer to see inscribed on the Republican national banner of 1S7 Grant and "Garfield. We are glad to know that our course in this matter meets the approval of Republicans, not only In our loomed ate vicinity, but also by gentlemen at a distance, whose opinions are not of light value. "We expect to keep this ' ticket at the head of our columns and . to say at opportune times an earnest word in Its behalf, hoping these - worthy names may be the honored choice of the Republican party to lead It to victory in the approaching important political contest. We believe the masses of the people favor the re-nomination of General Grant for the Presidency. We have heard scarcely a dissecting voice among the Republicans of this coun . ty. Intriguers are endeavoring to fleet combinations for the purpose of revenging their disappointments or promoting their individual ambitions fiir place and power, but the people, who have bo designs upon the public . treasury, or an inordinate yearning for the imagined honor of official posi tion, care nothing for the clamor of the disaffected, whether of high or low degree. They will go for the man who has filled his trust faithful ly, capably and fearlessly. The Democratic presses teem with malignity toward Senator John Sher man, and hare pnt in circulation a nnm her of false reports designed to injure him personally in popular estimation. The Columbus Journal gives a quietus to one of these untruthful stories. It ays of the Democratic newspaper sto ry that Senator Sherman has secured apartments and is going to " keep open house" at the Veil House, there is not a word of troth in the report. The Neil . House proprietor assures the Journal that Senator Sherman has not made anr engagements at that hotel for the winter, although he is prepared to entertain . Senator Sherman in the customary style at the usual rates. A dozen of colored students of the risk University of Xashville, Tennessee, have beer giving concerts in some of the larger towns and cities of the country, fur the benefit of the institution, which has already sent out through the Sooth about five hundred teachers among the people of color. H.is company of stu dents stopped at Mansfield, Ohio, a few days Since, and advertised a concert. Now Mansfield happens to be burdened with a full corps of Dcmeeratio officials ud as the chief end of Democracy is to persecute the colored population, of orse this opportunity could not be last. and so tber concluded to i moose a tax of f 3 on the singers, although the city or dinances expressly exempt concerts and lectures from municipal tax. Well the pshot was this : The audience learned rf the imposition and the ' hat being passed, the sum of 30 was raised, nonga to pay the license fee and leave a handsome balance. The rebuke may possibly be a good lesson lo the rebuked officials. Various have been the theories ad vanced by theologians and others ex planatory of the causes which, in their opinion, led to or permitted the terri ble disasters at Chicago and other points in the Sorth-west A Mor mon Elder named Miles, bad his say an the subject, in a discourse preached Inst Sunday at Williamsburg, X.

Hundreds of lives were lt. Do you not, my brethren, see in this tiie .Uaud of God laid bare? Yes, the same day, that place where all this ' persecution was eonsocted, that place where a political party placed a plank in its platform that was to wipe out Che twin relics of barbarism, slavery and polygamy, that place too was wiped out and laid in ashes, the city of Chicago. These are but a few of Che things that are to come. It there fore behooves you, the Saints of God, " Co awake from your sleep and gather to the valleys in the mountains " An elopement occurred at Fredonla, Mercer county, Pa., last week. A blacksmith's apprentice ran a way with his employer" -wife, a woman old enough to be his mother, leaving the blacssraith and the six children- to meditate on the uncertain ties ot life. It is suggested that now that the out-door season is over, the hae ball athletes turn their attention to sawing up wood piles for widows and iu--Tfllids. as by as President's Message on the Financial Situation. We make the following extracts from the President's Annual Message sent to Congress on Monday last, in regard ti the subjects of the National Debt, Re- duction of Taxes, The Collection of the Revenue and Gold vs. Currency : THE 

NATIONAL DEBT. ' The national debt has been reduced to the extent of $S,057,126.&0 during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, the in terest on the public debt nas been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly i i ,uuu,wu less uuoa uie isi oi aiarcn. tso. REDUCTION OF TAXES. It was highly desirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them, but in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends of the rapid development of the re- sources of the country, its increasing ability to meet laree demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I there fore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. I rec ommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobacco in its various forms Irera sumps In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate shall be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected un der the present laws alter providing for toe current expenses ot toe government, the interest account and a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced iu such manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home. Such as medicines compounded, etc., from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general nse. All such articles I recommend be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisa ble, l would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor. I have not entered into figures. because to do so would be to repeat all that has been laid before you in the re-1 port of the of the THE 

COLLECTION OF THE REVENUE. present collecting reve- nues pay collectors of customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at principal ports of I entry particularly, raise the compensa- uon ei tnese omeers to a large sum. 11 I has always seemed to me as if this sys- men. should such eet possession of those omces,to be lax in their scrutiny or make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject.

About a First Class Hotel. Few persons have an idea of what a world jn itself is a first-class hotel, and what it takes to keep it running. We find in the New York Commercial Adver tizer some account of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, in that city, which will interest the reader. . The report savs : STATISTICS.

Editor Chronicle : Trumbull coun ty is, as your readers all know, properly speaking, a dairy county, and much money has been made ,'rom that business here ; but this year, many of our farmers will not pay expenses, dairy produats being so low, and besides this, many of us are paying $2 per hundred for getting our milk manufactured, besides paying from $2 to $3 per cow for delivering our milk at the factory, and bringing back about two-thirds of the whey that belongs to ns. I have been informed by one of the patrons of a neighboring faotory that the cheese manufactured there up to September first, will not bring the pat rons 6 per hundred ; that being the case it is plain to be seen it leaves but a small income for the farmer on his invest ments. And now brother farmers what are we going to do keep on patronizin the factories and holn them to make in six months, on a capital of from three to four thousand dollars, a net profit of four to five thousand dollars, and we work for nothing and board ourselves f No. If the proprietors of factories cannot come Joint from their present prices w must do our own manufacturing and let the factories take care of themselves. We hear it stated that certain factories have had several funerals ; if that is so, who are the losers T I for one do not care lo sink (in the factory system) what money I have made and saved by making and selling my own cheese. We are all interested in this matter and let it be agitated so that the cream can all rise to swell ftctorymen's purses. A
