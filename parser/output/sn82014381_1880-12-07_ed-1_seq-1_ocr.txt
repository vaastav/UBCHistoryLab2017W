Washington, December Cth.— The following is the full text of the President's message, delivered to Congress this morning : -. : | Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Rep resentatives : I congratulate you on ' the continued and increasing prosperity of : our country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blest during the past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable employment for all our people, with contentment at home and with 77-*7 I PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP ''■■' With other nations. The occurrence of the twenty fourth election of a Chief Magistrate has afforded an other opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and s.fo —_____■ 'of the power and authority of the Government from the public ser vants whose terms of office are about to expire to their newly-chosen successors . 'i This example can not fail to impress the rrofessedly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which re publican institutions offer. The general cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens in the result of the election gives a gratifying —sural to our country and to its friends throughout the world that a gov ernment based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses eminently a strength, stabil and permanence not found in any other form of government. " „ 77, AFFAIRS IS THE SOUTH. The continued opposition to the lull and free en joyment of the rights of citizenship conferred upon the colored people by the Constitut'on still pre vails in several of the late slavchoiding- States. It has, perhaps," not been manifested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac tices in connection with ballDts, with the retaliations as to its places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all right*— the right of suf frage- which the Constitution expressly confers on our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism, as a factor in our politics, should disappear. They prefer that no section of the country should be united in a solid opposition to any other section. *I he disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal right* amendments to the Constitution, Is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our po litical contests. As long as these amendments are flagrantly violated or disregarded, it is safe to pre sume that the people, who placed them in the Con stitution a* embodying the legitimate results of the war the Union, and who believe them to be wise and necessary, will , continue to act together, and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The para mount question still is, as to the enjoyment of the right by every ; American citizen, who has the requisite qualifications, to freely cast his vote and have, it honestly' counted. "7' With thi* jueatiw, rightly settler), the country will be relieved ot . rj^B contentions of the past ; bygones will indeed be by gones, and political and party Issues with respect to the economy and efficiency of the administration, internal improvements, the tariff, deme—ie taxa tion, education, finance an 1 other important sub jects, will then receive their full share of attention. But resistance to and nullification of the results cf the war will unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of the Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the peo ple of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our Government They are the solemn expression of the will of the people of the United States. The sentiment that the con stitutional rights of all our citizens must be main tained does not grow weaker. | It will continue to control the government of the country. Happily the history of the late elections shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the Fif teenth Amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether if firm and well considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of the election re turns and qualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such viola tion shall accrue to ai.y person or party. . It will be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient appropria tions for the purpose, to' prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving, citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. 7 77, 7 7 . POPULAR EDUCATION. - It must no', however, be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of the primary rights of citi zenship is to be found in that capacity for self-pro tecti— which can belong only to' a people whose right to universal suffrage Is supported by univer sal education. ' The. means at the comnirnd of local and State authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. ; • This is especially true . where before emancipation I the education of the '. people was neglected or prevented 'in : the interest ol slavery. j Firmly convinced that the subject of pop ular . education ' deserves ; the | earnest :: attention of - the : people ol ■"• the .; whole j country, i and with a view to wise and . comprehensive action by the Government -of the United States,' 1 respectfully recommend that Corgress, by suitable legislation, and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citi zenship have been devolved on an uneducated peo ple, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and, if necessary, by appropriations from the treasury' of the United States, j Whatever the Gov ernment can fairly do to promote free popular edu cation ought to . be done. Wherever general educa tion is found, peace, virtue and social order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. .7 THE CIVIL SERVICE. In my former annual ' message* I have asked the attention : of ;-" Congress rto the , urgent necessity of a , reaffirmation of ; the civil ; service . system of i the '- Government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage or ap pointments for personal or partisan consideration have been strengthened by my observation and expe rience in the Executive office, and I believe the dan ger* j threaten the stability. of , the; Government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be perma nently tolerated. They tend to become more alarm- r ing with the enlaigement] of I the administrative service, as the growth of the country and population increase* the number of officers and placemen em ployed. 7 The ' reasons .: are imperative for 7. the adoption of ; fixed rules for ■ the ; regulation of appointments, promotion,: 1 pay .' and . remov als, and the istablishing 'of ; a : uniform method, having exclusively in every instance the attainment of the best qualifications for "the position in que*-' tion. Such a method 'alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most econom ical -ids efficient _ administration of j the | public business. Competitive examinations in aid of im partial appointments?, and | promotion ; hare . been conducted for some years past in everaTc. the ex ecutive department*, and by my direction the~sy_ tem baa been adopted in the Custom-houses and Postofflce* of the largest cities of the country. In the city of New York over 2,000 persons ___ "the civil service have been subject 'tv their appoint ments andjlenure of place to the ' operation of pub lished rules for the; purpose during the past two" y *?!-;' i The result* of these practical trials have been very satisfactory, aid ' have confirmed my opinion in favor, of thi, lystei of selection^* AU are subject to the same tests, an I the result is free from prejudice, personal favor or parti- an influence. It secure* for the porition applied for the best qual ification* attainable among the * competing appli- : - y : y ■ ■ .--'''-. ■.'■■>--■ r - ----- ■■■■■'-.■■■ ..,,.-..-.. .. ..:-, ..,.-.' - - - -■.....■■■--. c-^pte. .; It is an effectual ; protection from the prers ure of f importunity, which, under ] any other - course , pursued,'.; largely '. exacts the . time and J attention ;cf ' the appointing office s, '. to their great.-- detriment in the  discharge of . other official duties, X preventing .": the .7 abuse of $?_> sen-ice . for the mere furtherance of private I ° T iiarty purpo es, and having the employe of the Government freed from the obligation posed by ! patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention " *?."'. advancement; and with this constant incentive to exertion and improvement. 7 These invaluable re : suits have been attained ' in a high degree in the ; offices where the rules for appointment by competi tive examination have been applied.7 A' method which has so approved itself by experimental tests : at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive, should be extended ti all subordinate positions under the Government. VT believe a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency in i the civil service and its pro tection frirn recognized abuses, and that the expe rience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in the Cus tom-houses and Postofiaces have been held under many j embarrassments, and . without ; provision for .; compensatson r_ for the extra 7 labor per formed "by * the officers who have 7 con ducted them, and . whose commendable interest in the public service has induced : this devotion and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be expected, and without an appropriation by Congress for com pensation it is not practicable to extend the system of examinations generally throughout the civil serv ice/; It is also highly important ; that all such ex aminations should Ibe conducted upon a uniform system and under a general supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised Statute* authorizes the Presi dent to prescribe the regulations for admission to the civil service of the , United States, and j for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to the fitness of each candidate in respect to bge, health, character, knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter.* But the law is practically inoperative, for : the 5. win t ' of the requisite ap propriation. I therefore recommend an appropria tion of _25,0C0 j per j annum to meet the ex penses; of a ; committee to be appointed by the President, in accordance with the terms of this sec tion, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uni form and efficient ■*_ em of competitive examination, and to supervise the applicatiou of the same through out the entire civil service ; of the Government I am persuaded that the facilities which such a com mittee will afford fur , the testing of the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as wel come a relief to the members of Corgress as it will be to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also tend to remove the causes of em barrassment which now unavoidably and constantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between the legislative and executive departments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competi tion of influence and official favoritism in the be stowal of office will be the substitution of in open competition f of ; merit , between the applicants, in which every one can make his own record, with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone. 7 I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opinion - and to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen in the refusal of all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise certain stringent provisions against the use of official authority to coerce the political action of private citizens or official subordinates, is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and especially to reform in the method of appoint ment and removal, bag been found to be the prac tice, under what is known as the " spoils system," by which the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by member* of Congress. ' The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a com plete divorce between Congress and Executive in the matter appointments. The corrupting doctrine ' ml "to the victors belong the spoils" is insepar able from Congressional patronage, as the estab lished rule and practice of parties in power. It seen— to be understood by applicants for office, and by the people generally, that Representatives and Senators are :' entitled . to 7 disburse the patron age of their respective districts and States, It is ; not here necessary to recite at length the evil resulting frrm this "usurpa tion of the executive • functions. The true principles of the Government on the subject of appointments to efflce, os stated in the National Conventions if the leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the Ameri can people, and have not been called in question in any quarter. ; These authentic expressions cf public opinion upon this all important subject are the statement of principles that belong to' the consti tutional structure of the Government -that under the Constitution the President and heads of depart ments are to make nominations for office, tho Sen ate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prose cute " faithless officers. . The best interest if the public service demand ' that these distinctions be respected ; that Senators and Representatives, who may be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office. • To this end the co-opera tion of the legislative department of the Govern ment is requested alike by the necessities of the case and by public exigencies. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the demand made upon them with reference to appointment to office until by legislative enactment the pernicious practice is condemned and forbidden. It is therefore recom mended that an Act be passed defining the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office by the President, and 1 also recommend that the provisions of Section 1767 and of the sec tions following, of the Revised Statutes, computing the tenure of offica Act of March 2, 1867, be repealed. Believing that the reform of the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest nnd most imperative duties .of statesman ship, and that it can jbe permanently done only by the co-operation of the legislative and executive de partments of the Government, I again recommend the whole subject to your considerate attention. 

POLYGAMY. It is the recognized duty and purpose of th.. people of the United States and States to suppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territories and prevent its extension. : Faithful and zealous efforts have been ma 'c by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, ■ requires 7 executive, modification " and amendments. ■ The longer action is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon . sectarian . organization . which - uoholds polygamy has the whole power of making and ex editing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses a large influence over the administration of justice.' Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power, of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject of polygamy, and in fact to prevent It* enforcement. ' Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends upon those who practice it and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power |of - Congress . to - enact : a suitable law to protect A. the . Territeriea -.' is ample. It is not safe 7 for •• half-way measures. The political power • of : ; the . Mormon V sect : is •'.-■ increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most pop ulous Territories. It is extending steadily into other Territories. Wherever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. ' '•!, The sane tity of marriage and family relations are the corner stone of our American : society : and 'civilization. Religious liberty and the separation of Church and State are among the elementary" ideas of free insti tutions. For. the re-establishment, of the Interests and principles which polygamy and Morni onism have imperiled and the reopening to intelligent and vir tuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our do main which has been in a great degree closed to gen eral immigration by the j intolerant and immoral ta stitutions, it is recommended that the government of the Territory cl Utah be reorganized, that Con gress provide for the government of Utah by a Gov ernor and Judges or Commissioners appointed by the i- President and confirmed ' by the Senate, or a government analogous to the irovisional govern ment established : for the territory; northwest of Ohio by the ordinance 'of 1737. I', however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of the local government, I ' recommend f that the right to vote, bold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to thine who neither practice nor uphold • folygamy. ■ i If • thorough !' measures ; are adopted, it is believed ' that within a few year* the evils which now affect Utah will te eradicated, and :r^.-r?^^-a.,i^,,:i«ii.;irrWii s^A.:ra'- -.~-j:-'y- ! this T^ t °* f ? * a }.

My anticipation of an early reply from the Rritfcli Government to the demand of indemnity to ont fishermen for injuries suffered by that I im tustry at Fortune Bay] — January, IS7B, which I expressed in my last annual message, was • a disappointment. This answer wa* received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and when received exhib ited a failure of accord between the two Govern ments as j to the measure of inshore fishing privi leges secured to our fishermen by the Treaty of Washington, and of so serious a" character that I made it the subject of a communication to Congress, ln which I recommended the adoption * of measures which seemed to me proper ta ba taken by this Government in the maintenance of the right* ac corded to our fishermen j under the treaty, and to wards the i security and indemnity for the ] injury these interests had Buffer ed.."A bill to carry out tbeae recommend— tions wa* under consideration by the House of Representatives at the time of tbe adjournment of Congress in Juno last. Within a few week* I have received a communication from Her Majesty's Government renewing consideration of the subject, both of indemnity for injuries at For tune Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty, in which the previous correspondence bad shown the two Governments to be at variance upon both these topics.:' A disposition, toward a friendly agreement is manifested by the recognition of ounight to in demnity for the transactions at Fortune Bay, leav ing the measure of such indemnity to a further conference, and by an assent to the views of this Government presented in the previous correspond ence, that the regulation of the conflicting inter* tl of the shore fijhery of the provincial sea— as ts and the vessel fishery of our fishermen should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two Governments. . I sincerely hope a basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views in the interprets., tion of the fishery clauses of the Treaty of Wash !y will in good time become one of th. •ous and attractive of the now States o —S

'} 777 THE AUSTRALIAN EXHIBITION'S, *.-. - 11l the important exhibition of arts and industries which was rid last year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at Mel bourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably resented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable depart ments, and the participation of the United States was recognized . by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne, the -line- taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree of success Is confidently expected. FOREIGN RELATIONS. The state of peace and tranquillity now enjoyed by all the nations of the Continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have con cluded and ratified a Convention with the French Republic for be settlement of the claims of . the citizens of either country against the other." Under thi* Convention a Commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist, appointed in pursuance of the request of both nations by his Majesty the Emperor of ■ Brazil, _ has ' been organized, and has begun its session in this city, A Congress to co ns'der moans for the protection of industrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the Minister* of the United State* in France and Belgium as dele gates. 7ji77777 : .7:.'.'7^77:- ; ■: yy-A Ihe International Commission upon Weights and Measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your attention to the necessity of an appropriation to be made to enable this Govern ment to comply with its obligations under the met rlcal convention. ' ' > 7;". ";'_;■. ':'.' '',-'A Our friendly relations with the German Fmpire oontinue without interruption.'-? At the recent In.

The result of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this importa— and growing industry. I There have been some questions raised between the two Governments as to tho pioper tffect and interpretation ol our treaties of naturalizition.but recent dispatches from our Minister at Berlin Bhow that favorable progress is making toward an understanding in acoordanca with the views of this Government, which makes admits no distinction whatever between this tai,t and growing industry. There have been questions raised between the two Governments the pioper effect anl interpretation of our _ of naturalrzition, but recent dispatches from mister at Berlin show that favorable progress e'uig toward an understanding in acoordanc3 the views of this Government, which makes dmits no distinction whatever between the rights of native and naturalized citizens of the United States. In fact, the complaints of molesta tion suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present, There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations with the Governments of Austria, Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. * During last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine of this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, boarded and searched :by armed cruisers of the Spanish Government. : The ciicumstance, :as re ported, involved not only private injury to the per sons concerned, but seemed too little observant of the friendly relations existing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish Government in a mi ous protest and remonstrance, and the matter is un dergoing investigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such reparation as may be called for by the facts. - The Commiss icn sitting in this city for the - adjudication .of the . claim* of j our citizens against the Government of Spain is, it is hoped, ap proaching a termination of its labors. The claims against the United States, under the Florida treaty with Spain, was submitted to Congress for its action at the late session, and I again invite your attention to this long-standing question, Willi a view to a final disposition of the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish Government a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid co consider the subject of the protection ' by foreign powers of the native Moors in the Empire of Morocco. The Minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations : of this conference, the result of which is a convention, ' signed on behalf of all the Powers represented. .

The provisions made by Congress at its last ses sion for the expenses of the Commission which has been appointed and entered upon negotiations with the Imperial Government of China on a subject of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the Commissioners to proceed at once' upon their mission. The Imperial Government was pre pared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the con ference* proceeded with . such rapidity that on the I7th of November last two treaties were signed at Tckin-onc relating- to the" introduction of Chinese into this country, and one relating to commerce.
