The annual exhibition of the North Carolina Poultry Association will he held in High Point, January 14-17 Reduced railroad rates have been secured. Its promoters say that it will be by far the best poultry show ever held in North Carolina. In our next issue we shall begin the publication of a very interesting aeries of articles on Nature Studv, by Mrs. F L Stevens. Mrs. Steven is deeply interested in the subject, and is a charming writer The reader will be unjust to himself if he fails to read what she will have to say on nature study and allied topioa. The Charlotte Observer hopes that "in the rural library movement iD Nortb Carolina to-day, current lit erature will be kept in tue back ground in favor of thec'ai al novel, history, biography, science, eto." Here is an evil to be guarded again -t this orbze for the nesr though it ought not to be necessnry to warn those in charge of our schools Should it appear at any point, how ever, it should be promutlv reporter and supuresed. The public scho 1 libraries, supported by the taxe n the people, are not the p;ace f . r literary fads. The arrival of the December num ber of that beautiful magazine "Country Life in America,' remind us of many evidences of an awakea ing nmng city people generally t -the tuivank ges of fields, forests and fre-h air over the crowded, dustv dwellings of our oities. These al call to mind Tom Dixon's propheoy at this year's Wake Forest com mencement that America in the twenintu century will not build cities, but will develop the rural dis trict; that "with reference to cities the great work will be the cleaning up at the pig pens already built." "It is semi-officiall7 announced," says Walter Wellman, "that no more negroes will be invited to dine at the White Houe." Presiden Roosevelt is generally regarded a very stubborn, but he seems not t be incapable of learning. We con detuned hiM action in the Booke Washington dining at the time, but we did not then believe nor do we yet believe the statement of some rabid partisans that he intended it as an insult to the South. A man proud of the fact that he had an uncle as an admiral in the Confeder ate Navy and who regards Lee as "the very greatest of all the cap tains that the English-speaking peo plea have brought forth" may not un derstand the South and its custom-!, and so may violate them, but only the men ignorant or anxious to make political capital, will say that he "would attempt to insult us. 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE. When a small boy, we remember hearing an old man say that he could not understand how newspaper men managed to find enough matter to fill up a large paper eaoh day. In reality, however, the newspaper man's troubles oome from an entirely different direction It is easy enough to find matter to fill up ; the difficult work lies in deciding what to leave out. We are reminded of this j'ist now by our efforts to give Progress ive Farmer readers in four or five columns the gist of JPresident Roose velt's twenty column message. But this by the way. The message is longer than the average one of its kind, but more readable, we think. It is not dull, and yet there is in it nothing to suggest the reoklessness or jingoism of whioh Roosevelt has been so often accused. In fact, we find one of our contemporaries that only a few weeks ago referred to President Roosevelt as a "wild man" now complaining that his message is too tame and uncertain in tone. The message begins, as was to have been expected, with a feeling tribute to the late President KoKinley and an appeal for anti anarchist legisla tion. For our part, we have little faith in the ability of Congress to suppress anarohy by statute. As the World's Work says : "It is a kind of social insanity that it is hard to deal with till it take form in some definite aot," and seems to flourish quite as well under the ban, in Europe, for instance, as it has done in free Amerioa. We believe that the exolusion of vicious, low-grade im migrants from our shores, as the President recommends further on, will do more to destroy anarohy than any law for the suppression of anarchist meetings and anarohist newspapers. Mr Roosevelt approaches the trust problem very cautiously, not with so much sincerity and boldness as was evidenced in his talk on trusts in his Minneapolis speech a few days before his elevation to the Presi denoy. But his recommendations, as far as he goes government in speotion and supervision of the great corporations engaged in inter-State business are good. We should like to see them adopted. Two sentenoes of his section on trusts are worth re membering : "It should be as much the aim o: those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politio of crime of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions ; and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they w rk in harmony with these institu tes " The creation of a new cabinet 'ffiH, to be known as the Depart 'tint of Commerce and Industries, is advocated. This idea seems to have become popular during the' past few oionths, and we suppose that it will on adopted by Congress. We have already referred to the recommendations looking to th re striction of immigration, and in line with these is the suggestion that the Chinese exolusion law's ten year limit, whioh expires next M ty, should be at once extended. This also we regard as wise. But along with the high sounding eulogies of the late President Mc Kinley, it is very noticeable that the d -ctrine to the advocacy of which his last public speeoh was demoted, is now in but scant favor. We re fer, of course, to reciprocity. In this matter President MoKinley seems to have been for once in advanoe of the time, for e believe that reciprocity will grow steadily in popular favor, ilthough President Roosevelt has evidently weakened in the face of nhe present opposition to all inter ference with existing tariff laws. Of the entire address the veiled advocacy of the ship subsidy bill is, in our opinion, the mo"t indefensible. As we see it and we are sure that in this opinion we are supported by praotioally all the independent edi tors and public men in the country the ship subsidy bill is class legisla tion special privilege, of the most vicious sort. What if our merchant marine is in bad condition? Must the government offer subsidies to every industry that lags behind in the march of progress? Paternalism is the very life-blood of this ship subsidy bill, and yet its advocates are the very people that have pro claimed most loudly against patern alism Consistency is indeed a jewel. On the other hand, we note with pleasure that the President has brought to the attention of Congress, though in very mild language, to be sure, the necessity for amending the Inter-State Commeroe Aot. His extended reference to the preservation of our forests is also timely. Of the Philippine problem, he says nothing noteworthy, unless we ex cept the statement that America has erred, if at all, by giving the Filipi nos too muoh liberty ; that we have assuredly not given them too little. The building of the Isthmian Canal is urged. Here, we think, and not in ship subsidies, is where the best work for our merchant marine can be don. We hope this Congress will not adjourn until steps have been taken for beginning the actual work of dig ging the canal. Of all the subjects disoussed the President speaks most vigorously, perhaps, regarding the need of a stronger navy and of the extension of oivil servioe. His past reoord and utterances had prepared the people to expeot this. On the whole, we regard the mes sage as an able one. Its most note worthy feature is the appearanoe of remarkable impartiality in the dis cussion of the subjeots. So far from living up to his reputation f or ob stinacy, Mr. Roosevelt seems to have gone out of his way to give "the other fellow's side" of nearly every question disoussed. 

DECEMBER ALLIANCE TOPIC. The committee, consisting of Sec retary Parker, Maj. W. A. Graham and the writer, appointed by the State Allianoe to arrange topics for discussion in the Sub. meetings, sug gest as the subject for December: Will it pay the farmer or farm boy to attend the 10-week ' oourses in agriculture and dairying soon to be begun by the A. & M. College? Full information on this subjeot oan be obtained from Dr. Chas. W. Burkett, West Raleigh, N. C. We should like to have this topic thoroughly discussed in The Pro gressive Farmer. FOB THE LONG WINTER EVENINGS- Q00D BOOKS. We hope that our efforts to en courage the reading of the best books will bear muoh fruit this win ter. In every home some new books should be plaoed books new to the members of that family, but not new in the matter of years that have elapsed eime they were first pub lished. There are exceptions to all rules, of course, and there must be some exceptions to this rule, but we venture to say that there are not a thousand families among the five hundred thousand in North Carolina that do not need this advioe to seek after the old in literature rather than the new, and to buy books of biog raphy, science, essays, poetry, his tory, nature study, etc , rather than so muoh fiotion. We knOAV that the beautiful Olivia Raney Library in this city is visited daily by women and some men, we supp )se that never get beyond the shelves containing the works of fiotion. The fiction list furnishes 70 per cent, of the books read The romances of science, histoiy, and biography, the thoughts of great poets, prophets and philosophers all are neglected in the scramble for the latest novel. This is literary dissipation, and hardly less in . jurious to mind and character than physical dissipation. The sacrifice of the old, time tried works to the new ones of uncertain value reminds us of nothing so much as of some foolish man choosing ore newly mined and of unknown com position, rather than nuggets tested by the best assayist and pronounced pure gold. This illustration applies especially to works of fiction and to essays ; in science, of oourse, new discoveries are being made eaoh day, and the new is bettor than the old. Better sit by the fireside alone with your thoughts than cumber your mind with iunk shop trash such as the average new novel or, worst of all, the average "sample oopy" monthly or semi-monthly. But the world's best books are now being issued in oheap editions, and will cost you no more than the gaudy affairs that the book agent or train butoher has in stock. Get some of the best works and read them ; you can make no better use of the long winter nights. We shall be glad to answer as best we can any inquiries regarding this subject. Where demonstrations oome in the van, remonstrations oome in the rear. Landor. A FEW FEATURES OF THIS ISSUE. Harry Farmer has a thoughtful letter contrasting the cash and credit systems of buying' farm supplies. The difference is not so great as it was before the days of the Farmers' Alliance, but it is still very marked. Mr. J. C. Beavers, an A. & M. Col lege student, furnishes us an inter esting article on smuts and rusts in grain crops. Letters from young farmers and agricultural students are always welcome, and we hope that others will follow the example get by Mr. Beavers. A live question is that disoussed by Bray in the dipping from the Raleigh Post, and we should like to have it thoroughly debated in our columns. The second installment of Dr. Burkett's "The Live Stook Industry in the South," is no less interesting than the first. The comparison of New York cows with North Carolina oows is astonishing, and ought to awaken interest in what Dr. Bur kett will have to say as to the causes of the difference in product and profit. No one should lay aside this paper before reading Mr. C. S. Wooten's "On the Old Plantation Before the War." This we regard as the best of the series of artioles that Mr. Wooten has written for the Char lotte Observer. The style and subjeot matter are equally fascinating. MEETING OF THE STATE BOARD OF AGRI CULTURE. The semi-annual meeting of the State Board of Agrioulture was held in this city last week. Commissioner Patterson submitted his annual re port, a very interesting dooument. Among the more noteworthy faots brought out in it are those in regard to the sale of fertilizers. The follow ing table shows the number of tons sold in North Carolina in each of the years named, and also the revenue derived by the Department from the tonnage tax: Sales by Tons. Revenue. 1898 244,808 (at 25o) $59,511.01 1900 276,238 (at 20o) 55,247 69 1901 339,941 67,988.24 " The number of tons sold during the spring of 1901 were 291,408 and the revenue was $58,281.64. The number of tons of fertilizers sold during the fall season were 48,533, and the receipts were $9,706 60. The increase in sales for 1900 over 1899 was 31,430 tons, or nearly 13 per cent. The increase for 1901 over 1900 was 63,702 tons, or more than 23 per cent. The increase for the fall of 1900 over the fall of 1899 was 10,243 tons, or 30 per cent. The in crease for the fall of 1901 over the fall of 1900, was 4,470, or 10 per cent. The increase in revenue for 1901 over 1900 was $12,740 55." A loan of $20,000 was voted by the Board for the erection of two new buildings at the A. & M. College. "Watauga Hall," burned a few days ago, is to be rebuilt as a dormitory to accommodate twioe as many stu dents as did the old building. A new building to be used as dining hall and kitohen will also be ereoted. Important resolutions regarding the oattle quarantine and the inspec tion of ootton seed meal are pub lished in full in another oolumn. NORTH CAROLINA CROP NOTES. Newspaper reports indicate that the acreage of the wheat crop now being sown will be considerably larger than that sown last year. The second crop Irish potatoes grown with considerable profit in the trucking sections of the East, has proved more satisfactory this year than ever before. The yield has been unusually large and fancy prices have been received. The importance of the Spanish peanut industry in the Northeastern seotioh of the State is not generally recognized. Norfolk is the great market. The acreage this year was 10 per cent, larger than last year, but the News and Observer's reports from many correspondents in the peanut growing seotion show that unfavorable seasons have caused a decrease of 26 per cent, in the yield per acre. Last week a Texas brewery plead guilty to the charge of violating the anti trust law of that State, and was fined $5,500. At first blush, this may be regarded as a viotory for the anti -trust forces, but it will be re called that this was only a little com bination, and that somehow the trusts that really amount to something in variably manage to evade the law or to escape conviction if they violate it. The Thinkers. FOR THE ASKING. It is only necessary for some of our oounty people to go over terri tory, aeoure signatures to a petition asking for the estalishment of rural free delivery and the routes will be established in due time. This is an advantage and a convenience our people can secure for the asking, and the party who secures the signatures can get the salary of $500 per year for delivering, and the prospects are good for an increase in salary from time to time. Congress has already appropriated the money and there will be no ad ditional taxes as a result of these rutes being located in Rockingham. If we do not get them other oounties will; that's the whole thing in nutshell. Reidsville Review. STATE HISTORY. In his address of weloome to the Daughters of the Confederacy, Col. A. M. Waddell, mayor of tue city of Wilminerton. reminded the ladies that they were "on ground as his torio as any in America, although by a strange fate the faots whioh make It so have been generally un known to the people of the other States." Among these faots, Col Waddell cited the following, which will prove interesting reading to those familiar with them as well as to others : "1. Sixteen miles below Wilming ton on the west bank of the Cape Fear river where the ruins of St Pnilip's church still stand on the site of the oolonial town of Bruns wick, the first armed resistance to British oppression on this continent ocourred on the 28th of November 1765, when the Stamp Act was killed by men with guns in their hands. This was more than ten years be fore the Revolution, and nine years before the B jston Tea Party. "2 . Eighteen miles abo ve Wilming ton the first viotory of the American Revolution, (and a most important one) was won at Moore s Creek bridge on the 27th of February 1776 And yet a year ago when an appro priation was asked from Congress to oommemorate the event, so distin guished a New Englander as Senator Hoar, of .Massachusetts, declared that he had never so muoh as heard of Moore's Creek bridge "3. Twenty miles below Wilming ton on the opposite side of the river from Old Brunswick, and just one hundred years after the Stamp Act affair there, the most terrific bom bardment since the invention of gun powder occurred when Fort Fisher fell, and the last hope of the Confed eracy perished. I myself, heard an English naval officer who was at the eeige of Sebastopol and also at Fort Fisher, say that the artillery fire at Sebastopol was the greatest in the his tor v of the world up to that time, but that it was child's play com pared to Fort Fisher." Exchange. OUR FAULTY S STEM OF ELECTING CONGRESSMEN. Cngress met Monday. This is a new Congress, the Representatives in whioh were elected in November, 1900, over a year ago. It seems so strange and surprising that our Rep resentatives in Congress should be elected so long a time before they take their seats. They should be elected only a few weeks before going to Washington, and thus come fresh from the people. They would then more fully and properly represent the views and wishes of their con stituents. There are two changes so sensible and proper to be made that it is sur prising they have not long since been made. This is one change the time of Congress meeting or change the time of electing the Representa tives. And the other is to change the day of the President's inaugura tion from the 4th of March to some other day when the weather is more apt to be favorable. Pitta boro Record. THE 

DANGER OF COMMERCIALISM. One of the greatest dangers that threaten American institutions, to day, is commercialism. Our strenu ous life, with its hurrying and driv ing to get rioh, tends to foster the spirit of greed and traffio hunger ; and this spirit, in turn, tends to develop our material and ooarser f aoulties. Materialism is written all over American life to-day. In the anxious pursuit of dollars, many feel that they cannot afford time to de velop their social side. A foreigner visiting America for the first time. without knowledga of the business methods of its people, would get an idea that nearly every busings man in the country had lost a pearl, and, oblivious of everything else, was desperately searching for it. The fairest, the most beautiful possibilities of our civilization are too often trampled under foot in the mad rush for money, as if wealth were the only good ; fame, or noto riety, the great desideratum; and political power, the supreme object of life. Dr. O. S. Marden, in Suc cess. MANUFACTURES AND AGRICULTURE. Scotlar d Neok Commonwealth : It oosfs more to live in a manufactur ing town than it does to live in a town without manufactories. This is very easy of explanation. There are more people in a manufacturing town who have to buy everything thy consume. Gardens and poultry and the like have to be neglected frequently by those who work in manufacturing conoerns because they have little or no time to devote to suoh things. The result is that things usually brought in by farm ers and others in the country to the town to market sell at a better price, because there is more demand for them. And in all this there are many reasons why a farmer should oount himself fortunate in living near a manufacturing town. He can get better prices for his ohickens, eggs, spare vegetables, milk, butter, and the like. NORTH CAROLINA'S RECORD IN THE CIVIL WAR. That our State should have fur nished one-fifth of the soldiers in the Confederate armies, though there were eleven States in secession, and several of them larger, and that one fourth of the men in arms from our State were killed in battle, and one fourth died of wounds, and one-third of the remainder of disease, and had more men to stack rifles at Appo mattox and Greensboro than any other State is a remarkable reoord in itself and in comparison with that of other States. We presume these figures are approximately correct. They appear to be assumed generally to be as near accurate as suoh statis tics can be expected to be. It is a story that is worthy of repetition irequently that it may not be lor gotten. The telling of it ought al ways to make North Carolinians prouder still of their State. Rev. P. R. Law. The Chicago Judge who sentenced some newspaper men to jail for oon tempt of court justified himself by saying that "It such attacks are per mitted and allowed to go unpunished the judicial department of our Gov ernment cannot long survive." If the Judge's decision was a righteous one the paper that commented upon it adversely should have been allow ed to exoite the proper amount of contempt for itself. It it w un righteous the judge has given ad ditional grounds for the contempt of court which we are afraid to express, and whioh we therefore carefully conceal. The liberty of the press is just as precious as judicial dignity. Presbyterian Standard. IT SHOULD NOT, ANYWAY. The return of Henry M. Flagler and his seoond wife to the South for their winter residence is aooompanied by the information that a New York court has ordered Flagler to pay an annuity of $25,000 for support of his first? wife, who is still an inmUe of an insane asylum. But neither prompt compliance with this order, nor the faot that the Flaglers are protected in their present relation by a special law passed by the Legis lature of Florida, will entitle them to the respeot of decent people. Winston Journal. A oontemporay says that Rev. C. C. Thompson has oome out in the Raleigh Christian Advocate in a let ter criticising a recent lecture by Sam Jones. Mr. Thompson says the style of preaching done by Sam Jones and his imitators has done muoh to bring about a state of irrev erence for God and the Churoh." This is the Lord's truth and the only wonder is that Christian people tol erate suoh cattle, not to say enoour age them. States ville Landmark. Our task is not to show that any ground is less holy than it was of yore, but that all is holy alike. It i not that cathedral aisles have lost their sanotity, it is not that the Sab bath rest has suffered desecration, but that every day and every pl&ce alike are sacred to the Lord Selected. 1
