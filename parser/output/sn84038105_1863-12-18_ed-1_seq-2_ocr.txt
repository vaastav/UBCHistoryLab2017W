I • Bed Lion, De re The President's Annual Message, and Proclamation of Amnesty, We lay before the readers of the Union this woek. the President's Annual Mes sage to Congress ; and bis Proclamation offerlpg an Amnesty, with certain excep tional cas£3—to all those, now in rebelliop against the Federal Government, who will return to their dpty ; apd tako, and sub scribe an oath of allegiance. The piessage refers to tbip proclamation , And before we proocod to notice the sage further, it is proper to examine tho Proclamation, It piay be well remarked, that the Presi dent, with his very practical mind, sound judgment; and plain good sense; takes hold of, and treats the most difficult sub jects, with a plainness and simplicity of stylo, and distinctncßs of purpose, that leaves no one in doubt au to his meaning ; and he sustains his positions with mcnU so plausible, as to carry conviction to most of his readers ; and even to si lence these, and put them to serious thoughtfulness, who might feel disposed to question his views, The proclamation of Amucsty iß of this character. It lias often beeu asked, »'What arc we to do * with the rebels, after we shall have re duced them ?" This quostion has puzzled many men. And it is, confessedly, a question of great difficulty—a question, however, capable of au öasy solution, if we contemplate the character of our Government ; the nature of the rebellion, and Ahe dictates of hu manity. First.—The Federal Government, is not a l mon of the States, but of the people of the whole United States , aud is a compact , National Government, in unity with itself, harmonizing in its several parte, with checks, and balances, which at the same time that thçy protect the people, sustain and give vigor to the Government. It is a hetrodox opinion that a State , as such, can commit treason, or forfeit ite status, as a State, under the constitution of the United States. The people of the several States may commit treusou. In such case the constitution and laws of the United States, act upon the persons, not on the States ; so that, it is plain, no ordi nance of secession can take a State out of mes argu of to the Union, although all the people in that State may be in rebellion against the Fed eral authority. So soon as the insurrec tion, or rebellion is suppressed, and the Federal authority restored, then that authority resumes its sway or control over the people, and the State remains, as it was before, in the Union. This is the character of the Government. Second. — -4« to the nature of the rebel We have already said that a State can not commit treason, nor can it, as a State secede from the Union. The rebellion is that of the people against the constitution and laws of the United States. The State rename aa one of the United States of America, before and after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, subject, we admit, to the forfeitures, penalties, and confiscations which the rebels have brought upon themselves. Thirds—As to the dictates of Humanity. It is manifest, that a few leading, bad men, have plunged the people of the South into rebellion. The people themselves, the masses of the people, were, we are satisfied, opposed to secession. They express themselves in most of the Southern States, by Large majorities. Yet the ning and wickedness of the few ambitious demagogues, forced them into open und rebellion, with the Federal authori ties. SO cun war Then after the rebellion shall have bee« suppressed, how are prunithmenU to be jneted out against those who have com work ope and fore for its be one ter, wero tini, tion, ber, the ent ties ly P. ing to mitted treason ? No Nation upon earth, no matter how tyrannical, hasever involved the whole people, in one indiscriminate slaugh ter and punish meut for treason. leaders have been, and would in our own caBe, be punished, but the great masses of the people, thousands of whom have been conscripted and forced into the rebellion. Should not be punished with the vigor and severity of the laws against treason. The leaders being punished, either by confiscation and dcuth, or by confiscation and banishment, the people, the masses should be allowed to return to their duty, as quiet oitisens, and have the amnesty and clemency of a mild, parental govern ment extended to them. Further, the Constitution has clothed the President with the pardoning power. He may, as well befere as after conyiction, pardon an offender. In the case of the Proclamation of Amnesty now before us, we may regard it as an act of pardon, and executive clemency, extended to the guilty, before convictiou, and without a trial. And the good, sound policy of this act is apparent, It is the duty of the President to sec the laws faithfully executed tQ sup press this rebellion. A Proclamation of Amnesty, offering pardon to ajl those who shall lay down their arms and return to duty, and take and subscribe an oath of allegiance, is wise, apd humane ip itself, It tends to shorten the war, and to restore peace ; for we think, Jhuusands will avail themselves of this gracious opportunity to become recon ciled tp the Federal Government, apd thus logve the bad men who have plunged them into civil war, without the means of con ducting it. Men may differ from the President in regard to those who should be excepted from the operations of this proclamation ; but we think that the Presi dent, wi(h his usual good sense, has prob ably, in this case, decided correctly. Having thus briefly reviewed the proc lamation, we have but little space left to aqaliae the message. Our readers will see, and will read it for themselves. It has the great merit of brevity , and is so plain apd direct, that it is easy of compre hension by the plainest men. Wo would like to have time to make a few observations op our "Foreign relations," as exhibited in the message, W« could easily show— -first, that the wisdom, ability, and prudence of Mr. Lincoln's Adminis tration, have kept us at peace with Foreign Nations ; and secondly , that Divine Provi dence has graciously manifested itself in our behalf, ip regard to the condition of European Nations, Wo will in future continue these marks, The to to re foal mffaifg. large majority of tho physicians of this emnty, met in Georgetown, on Tuesday last, the 15th inst., and organized a County Medical Society, with Dr. William II.

LETTER FROM WASHINGTON. Washington, D. C. Doc. 11th, 1863. Mr. Editor : Wednesday the 2d inst., was a great day in the National Metropolis. The crowning of the " Statue of Freedom" took place at by a concourse of people. Immediately after tho crowning of tho statue tho glorious old Stars and Stripes wore given to the breeze some twenty or thirty feet above the stutuo and & salute of thirty five guns, representing the thirty-five States, which was responded to by the guns of tho fortifications around the eity. Truly this is a groat country! While treason with gory hunds has for tho last two and a half years threatened the very lifo of our , witnessed a it it beloved country, and tho rebel boats have been tho most of that time, almost or quite iu sight of tho Dome of the Capitol of the Metropolis displaying their too often victorious standard, this work of crowning Capitol with tho "Statuo of Freedom" has not for a single day been suspended. Tho events of the last two three y must indeed fill the civilized world with amazement and profound admiration. Aa 1 predicted in ray last letter, the House of Reprcscntetiv Hon. Schuyler Colfax speaker, the session, and Etheridge, and his cohorts, essayed to help the Copperheads, and thwart tho purposo of tho Union ist*, by placing on his lists several bogus represen tatives from the State of Louisiana with their cer tificates of election, as such representatives, pur porting to bo signed by one Biddle, who styled himself Governor of the State, and leaving off said list hone-fide representatives from the States of Maryland, Kansas, and Bomo other States, all of whom or nearly tion, thereby giving a copperhead majority in the organization of the House, and ho again to be elect ed elerk. But the scheme failed and the copper heads slunk away and abandoned their wicked de vice. organized, by the election of the first day of the first ballot. Tho lato olerk friends of the administra Congress is thcroforo in working order, both Houses having completed their organization and show symptoms of work in earnest. The message of the President Houses roceived and read in both Wednesday last, accompanying which was his remedy for ••restoration" of tho rebellious States, termed his " Proclamation of Amnesty." Fred. Douglass said a few days since in a locturo in Philadelphia, that " the nation had yielded long to pro-slavery compromises, that when the Nation came into tho hunda of Dr. Buchanan, that too far gone for medicine." 80 ■ > 'lo hncd it But it is generally conceded here that the treatment of the patient by Dr. Lincoln, who was called in when all hopes for the patients recovery, abandoned by such Doctors , ..... ... . ... . .. . .

It has undoubt Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives, * ' Another year of health and sufficiently abundant harvests has passed. For these, aud especially for tho improved condition of our national affairs, our renewed and pro found gratitude to God is own. We remain in peace and friendship with foreign Dowers. llie efforts of disloyal citizens of the United states to involve us 111 foroigu wars, to aid 111 inexcusable insurrection, having been un availing, Her Britannic Majesty's Govern ment, as was justly expected, have exercised their-authority to prevent tho departure of new hostile expeditions from British ports.— 1 he Emperor of France has, by a like pro ceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the oontest. Questions of great intricacy and im portance have arisen out of the biockude aud other-belligerent operations between the Gov ernmeut and several of the maritime Powers, but they have been discussed and, so far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our prise courts, by the impartiality oi their adjudications, have commanded the respect aucl confidence of maritime Powers. The Supplemental treaty between the Uni ted States and Great Britain, for tho suppres sion of the African slave tra.de, made on the 17th day of February last, has been duly rat ified and carried into executiou. It is be lioved that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inliu mau and odious traffic has been brought to aa T cu , d 'i, , -x r xi -, • „ . I shall submit for the consideration of the Senate a convention for tho adjustment of possessory claims m Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th of Juue, 18G4, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country. A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island oi Cuba, has been debated without reaching an .agreement, and it is proposed, in an ami cable spirit, to refer it to the arbitrament oi a friendly Power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the benate. I have thought it proper, subject to the ap proval of the kennte, to concur with the in terested commercial powers m an arrange ment for tho liquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the principles which have been hereto forc adopted in regard to tho imports upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. The long-pcnding controversy between this Gov °?c?i 0n * and 0 i 1 htngthoseizure of Silana, m Peru, by Chilian officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citi zens oi the United states, has beeu brought to a closo by the award of Ins Majesty the King of tho Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties.— The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly-respected magistrate, and, although the sum awarded to the claim ants may not h&vo been so large as they ex cted, i« ho reason to distrust the wis ol his Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chili when intelligence m regard to it reached that coun perhead will, cdly consolidated all the truo friends of tho Union. Radicals and conservatives, join hands and con gratulate each ether uponth& fact, that "Old Abe" has figured out at least a platform upon which all may stand, and unite hi the good worff of putting down this rebellion. While tho message and proclamation wa; being read a profound relief seemed to speak from every loyal face, while tho copperheads were dumb, and political dispair sat on the linoaments of each face. Tho faot appears to he that Abraham Lincoln is under Providenoe for this present crisis— tho people love him, and have tho most profound respeot for him, regarding him liypr this nation in its day of Bore calamity. They love him for his honesty, integrity, and patriotism, and any suggestion made by him appears to have a kind of magic about it, that does not attach to that of apy other man.

Congress is engrossing a largo sharp of the pcoplo's utUntion. As yet noth ing of importunée has been transacted. One would bo puzzled to enumerate the great things it is ex pected to do, and equally puzzled to tpll what it is not expcctod to do. Between the politicians that arc swarming hero and and our "shoulder strap" gentlemen, the hotels ought to be able to do a pay ing business. By tho way, "Uncle Sam" has enough officers "runninn loose" to officer an army ono large enough to have kicked Napoleon out of Mex ico, but it is to bo foarod that they would have to prefer that sport better than staying in front on the Rupidun, else 'twould be no go. Should Congress make "this cruel war over," or anything occur to interest your readers, or tickle their fancy, and in terest mo to write, I will correspond iftcn. B. W. President's Message. of of of of of of the 80 in try. The joint commission under the act of the lasession for carrying into effect tho con vention with Peru, on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in tho business entrusted to it. 1 {Difficulties concerning inter-oceanic transit . through Nicaraugn are in course of amicable aajustmeut. In conformity with principles 60 ' furth in my i ttst annual message, I have received a representative from the United dis- States of Columbia, and have credited a min ister to that republic. the and fair Incidents Occurring in the progress of oûr civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of internation questions teach ing tho rights of foreigners in this country and of th. United States citizens abroad.. In gard to some Governments, these rights arq, least partially, defined by troaties. In ho instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that, in the evont of civil war, a foreigner re siding in this country, within the lines of tho insurgents, is to he exempted from the rule which classes him as a beligerent* in whose behalf the Government of hia country cannot express any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, how ever, that such claims have been put forward, and, in some instances, in behalf of foreigners who have lived in tho United States tho great er part of their lives. There is reason to believe that many per 80s.born in foreign countries Who have de clared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have evaded tho military duty required of them by deny ing the fact, and thereby throwing upon the Government the burden of proof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to tho proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the clorks ef courts where declarations of intention may bo made, or naturalization effected, to send periodically lists oY the names of the persons naturalized, or declaring their intention to become citi zens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whoso department these names might be arranged and printed for general information. There is also reason to believe that foreigners fre* quently become citizens of the United States for tho sole purpose of evading the duties im posed by the laws of their native country, to which, on being naturalized here, they at once repair, and, though never returning to the United States, they still plaim the inter osition of this Government, as citizens.-^ lany altercations and great prejudices, have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is therefore submitted to your sorious considéra tion. It might bo advisable to tix a limit beyond which ho citizen of the Uuited States, residing abroad, may claim the interposition of his Government. The right of suff rage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens, under pretences of naturalization, which they have disowned when drafted into the military ftervice. I submit the expediency of such amendment of the law« as will inaVe th; fact of voting an estoppel against any pica of cinption from military servit*'.', o»-other civil obligation, on the ground of alienage. In common with other Western Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the pervers v opposition of tho hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations. It is hoped, aU though not with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to tho claim of the minis ter residing there for the dumages he sustain-, ed in tho destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Ycddo. Satisfactory arrangements have been made witjj the Emperor of liussla, which it i lioved will result .in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our Pacific const, I recommend to your fa vorable consideration the subject of an inter national telegraph across the Atlantic ocean, and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic board and the Gulf of Mexico, Such com munication, established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as*effect ive aids to the diplomatic, military, and na val service. The consular system of tho Uiiitod States, under the enactments of tho last Congress, begins to bo self-sustaining, aud there is r ' 8U " ho P° that 14 ™«y bocomo entirely with the increase of trade which will whenever peace is restored, Our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights. In protecting our commercial interests, our consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased laborH an d responsibilities, growing out of tho war, These they have, for tho most part, met'and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgement justly includes those con. suis who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Tur key, Japan, China, and other Oriental eoun tries, arc charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers. Tho condition of the several organized Ter ritorUs is generally satisfactory, although tho Indian disturbances in Now Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral sources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and Arizona, arc proving far richer than has been heretofore Understood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from tho Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for. tho encourage mont of immigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal ' of the precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus increased liorc, tens ef thou sands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign eonsu latcs and offering to,emigrate to the United States if essential but very cheap assistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the Govcrnmeut. Injuries unforseen by the Government, and and unintended, may, in some eases, have been inflicted upon the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on laud, by persons in flic service of the United States, As this Government expects redress from other Powers when similar injuries are in flicted by persons in their service upon citi zensof the United States, we must be pre pared to do justiee to foreigners. If tho ex isting judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law. Conven tions for adjusting the claims by joint corn mission have been proposed to some Govern montp , but^o definitive answer to the propo sition has yet been received from any. Jn the course of the session I shall proba Hy have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by the Admiralty courts. And in other cases whore this Government may bo acknowledged to bo liablo iu principle, and whero tho amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration, tho proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required, by the law of the United States upon the subject, to demand a tax upon tho incomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not, in strictness, bo a derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign country, tho ex-*^ pediency of so far modifying tkc act as to ex empt from tax tho income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration, J make this suggestion upon tho ground that a comity which ou^ht tq be reciprocated ex empts o-.r consuls in all other countries from taxation. To the extent thus indicated, the N an ex Im* Boa ea so, ensue re* 0 -
