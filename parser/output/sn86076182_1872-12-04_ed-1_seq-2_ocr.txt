MIXES OP EASTERN NEVADA. It has come to this: .That when the commercial newspapers of the Pacific Coast speak of the gnat mining interests of thevneignrrhoodtheyspeak'of What is doing in Nevada; and it is for 'this rea son" that we find such interesting mings up of matters and things pertain ing to Easttri Nevada in that excellent medium of rni""g, agriculture and com mercial affairs, the Alia CaRtvnua. 1 la J ib.9 issue of that paper for, the 2d in fiodhe foHowingr "The prospects of the Eureka Mining District which last year ui i duved about $2,061H'J88', fly improving. It is feported that the mass of payors wflently opened ia the Richmond mine measures not less than 40,000 tons, the gross yield of . which will be $2,400,000, and after makinc a consid erable. odaotfcn for error in hwth. titv) aad anahty, we aar Watery a J that the addition to the are-yield of the district nfft yaar,. wilj shotheiaduence of theBfchmondstriW.-' There It also a rmaor of a eoud strike in tto Phemx mine. x Las -jes- -turned -otitf aasToa.

It is said that the loss in smelting does not exceed two psr- ceatiM the metal, whereas in amalgamating, the loss f re- quenny uses io minj-uu ecu.. The cost of smelting a ton of ore ranges from $12 to $24, averaging about $18. An important item in the expense is the charcoaL of which 30 bushels. . worth troin 26 Jo 32 centsper buehel, are required for every ton. The transporta tion from the mine to the refining works. and the separation, cost f 70 (gold) per ton; and the lead sells for $110 or $130 per ton at the refinery; so the total net yield pert ton of base bullion is About $280, or $45 per ton of ore. " The district has 17 furnaces, of which 7 are not run ning. The idle furnaces are those of the Rnbv Consolidated, capacity about 20 tons ner dav: Boaaliad, 30 tons; Boil' whacker, 12 tons; Jackson, two furnaces, each of 12 tons; and Old Buttercup, two, each of 12 tons. The active furnaces are five of the Eureka Consolidated, of 32 tons each; two of Richmond, each 40 tons; one of Buby Consolidated, 45 tons; one of Phomix. 40 tons, and one of Sil ver West Consolidated, 50 tons making 370 tons of ore per day, equivalent to 61 tons of basebullion. The Silver West furnace is idle just at present, but is soon to commence on 4,000 tons of ore from the K. K. mine, and will probably soon have a laree supply of ore lrom its own mine. The furnaces moke continuous runs, lasting from 40 to 80 days; and at the end of each run must be relined, with a delay of three days, and a cost of $600. The small furnaces' are unprofitable and are idle; the large furnaces are ac tive, and if they had the capacity they could get 130 tons of ore per day beyond tne present supply, so tnac me iotsi ore yield of the district would be 500 tons, and the bullion-yield $23,600 per day. The Eureka Consolidated, K. h., Rich mond, Tip Top, Silver West and. Look out have large quantities of ore, though some of them are not yet provided with the facilities for cheap and rapid extrac tion. All of them hoist through shafts, and most of them have not yet gone down far. The Phornix and Orange are down 400 feet; the Eureka and Richmond 300, the SUver West 100. The latter mine is preparing to extract its ore through a tunnel, which is now in 150 feet and will be extended 200 feet further, striking the main vein about the end of February, at a depth of 210 feet below the present workings, where about 4,000 tons of ore are in sight, according to the Superin tendent's estimates. At 100 feet from the surface the ore in the main lode is 22 fett wide, and three other parallel veins on each side have beea found on the sur face, and so far as examined by shallow workings, seem to converge toward the middle or Excelsior lode. The only considerable lode of milling ore intbe district' is that of the Lemon mine, but probably little of it will be re duced until a tunnel 400 feet long, now under way, ahatt be completed. A tun nel 1,400 feet long would strike the lode 1.300 feet below the surface, and as the ore assays $130 to the ton, and the vein large and is supposed, to oe uniiorm m dips and richness, the tatam promrses much. At present the Lemon mill of fifteen stamps is encased in working about twenty tons of ore daily from the Gaddis and Bertrand mine in Secret Can yon. This ore avenges aoonr $ao- to tne ton, and tii ftirn smnlgsmnti i ia roasted at a cost of $3. per ton in a revolving in clined iron cylinder lined with fire brick." t NEW
