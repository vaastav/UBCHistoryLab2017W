The importance of the subjects dealt with is ample excuse for the unusual length of President McKinley’s annual message to Congress, the greater portion of which is about the war, the events leading up to it, connected with and following it, up to the acceptance ol our terms of Peace. The general tone of the message is highly commended; also the handling of the more or less deli cate question connected with our ac quirement of the Philippines. It is free from rancor and bombast,although fully recognizing the unprecedented achieve ments of the country in the war with Spain. Its dominant note is patriotism of the highest order—patriotism, such as every good American feels, regard less of political affiliation and can en dorse. If the sentiment in Congress ie representative ot that of tbs country, and it usually is, the message will be generally commended. While the legislation of the session of Congress, which opened to day, will have little direct connection with the newly acquired territory of the country, several of the regular appropriation bills notably those for the army and for the navy, as well as the bill for the increase of the regular army, will furnish texts, for many speeches on that subject, and tho talk of Senators and Representa tives indicates an intention to take full advantage of those texts. Consequently the debates of the present session are expected to be unusually lively and in teresting. i There is a disposition among promi nent republican Senators to fight shy of committing themselves either for or against holding an early Spring extra session of Congress, fo consider finan- ! cittl legislation, regardless of whether failure of the present session to pass all the legislation actually necessary makes an extra session imperative. Senator Allison was asked plainly whether be was in favor of an extra session to con sider financial legislation, but he adro itly declined to commit himsell and answered the question by saying: "The President must decide whether or not ihe new Oongressball speedily assemble; we have nothing to do with the ques tion." He was also averse to express ing on opinion, saying when asked to do so; "So many things may happen in the next three months that a prediction at this time regarding an extra session, must be necessarily based upon the mer est speculation." Secretary Alger says, in his annual report, in favor of his recommendation that it be provided in the legislation for increasing the regular army to 100, 000 men, that natives of islands occu pied by our troops may be enlisted: "These men are acclimated, understand the language and habits of their coun trymen, and their enlistment will not ouly give them employment, but also have the tendency to enable the govern ment to get into closer touch with their people than it would otherwise be able to do. This would also relieve our own men from serving in those climates to a large extent, and would, moreover, en able the volunteers to be mustered out of the service and return to the avoca tions of civil life." That last sentence will do more to hurry army legislation than any other one thing. Every Sen ator and Representative is besieged with requests to get this or that regi ment of volunteers mustered out, and they all know that no considerable number of the volunteers will be or dered mustered out until Congress pro vides for the enlistment of regulars to take their places. It is believed that this peculiar situation will keep men quiet who otherwise would bitterly op pose the bill providing for the increase ot the regular army. Senator Hale sees nothing but trouble and expense in the annexation of the Philippines, end declares his intention to fight the ratification of the treaty of peace to the full extent of his ability, regardless of what other Senatois may do. Mr, Hale's pictures of the calami ties likely to follow the ratification of the treaty of peace would be truly awful if he could make everybody see through his eyes. But it has not been forgotten that Mr. Hale drew some very weird pictures of what would happen to this country if it dared to make war on Spain, which were a long ways from what actually did happen; therefore his doleful talk isn't fetching any tears of alarm. The probability of Nicaragua Canal legislation is going to be a good thing for Washington hotel keepers, this win tin, and it may be that some inpecuue ous statesmen who will be dropped Irom Uncle Sam’s pay roll at the close of the present Congress, will also handle some of the Panama Canal Company's money which it is understood will be liberally spent to block Nicaragua Canal legisla tion. The house is the doubtful body; the Senate is knowp to be overwhel mingly favorable to the construction of the Nicaragua Canal bv this govern ment. There are signs that the admin istration will use its influence upon the House in favor of canal legislation. Kobbetl Ibe tirare. A startling incident, ot which Mr. John Oliver of Philadelphia, was the subject, is narrated by him us follows; "1 was in a most dreadful condition. My skin was almost yellow, eyes sunken, tongue coated, pain coutiually in back and sides, no appetite—gradually grow ing weaker day by day. Three physi cians had given me up. Fortunately, a friend advised trying 'Electric Bitters;' and to my great joy and surprise, the first bottle made a decided improve ment. I continued their use for three weeks,aud am now a well man. I know they saved my life, and robbed the grave of another victim." No one should fail to try them. Only 50 cents per bottle at Waters’ Pharmacy. Additional Locals.
