WALLACE, X2litor and l?urlislier. FAYETTEVILLE, TENNESSEE! Thursday Blorniug, Drc. 10, 1869 The "Yellow Man." The "ronrni" mn is the "vel Ijw man," and all his rights is the i.ew holby about to be bestrode by the enterprising and quiek-Bigbted of that party, who having agitated the negro question until the pubic are r-imply tick nd tired of it, cor find it necessary to incieasa thi ir politi cal stock io tmtfe by net? additions uV rc-nt importation. We tad thought the fifteenth amendment would probably meet the case of the Chinese, although not framed with special re'erenee to that people, but do not profess to speak frith certain ly upon the point, as cur c-py of the Constitution is Eome teverhl years o d, and of course without the j atorial district and Gen. Brown 1 modtrn improvements, and to fotDetfor tne Floterial district thus leav- degree antiquated. It would be a pity, too, that it should bo 6ettled in to summary a manner, because io that case a most splendid lot if por litical stock in trsde would be spoil ed befirre the politicians could have a chance to use it. Senator Sumner teems of the opinion that the "que - lion" is still "to le mef," and that they must "have protection," and so forth, 88 reported by the papers. We do tot deny that Col. IIol We take the following from thoBul-iman was gallant ai.d sclf-sacrific- timore Sun : The Rights of the Yellow Man S-nator Sumner, in a lecture at Klizabetb,New Jeis?y, on Saturday, warmly denounced the prejudice a gainst the yellow mnn from Asia. Tie Biid the Chinese question must ba met. Attention was once t trncted to the African; now it is the Chinese who demanded protection. Nothing can be settled which is not right, and this question can only be in harmony with the principles of our fathers and in conformity with Tight and justice. The Chinese must have fqual copartnership, Iot justice is the best policr, and justice is tbe best practice. Now, from this, it would seem that wo ought to have another amend ment to the Constitution at once ay amendment number seventeen; for by the proceedings of the woman's cuffrnge convention at Cleveland, Ohio, we see they claim number six teen for themselves. We presume tbe matter will be pressed in Con gress immediately, and protection and equal rights for the "yellow man" will shortly be the gathering cry of some of the political dune. EST It is urged that our friend Col. Holman served with distinc tion in the Confederate army. . This we grant. He served like a 'brave man long and well,"andde eerve? the gratitude of this people, and no doubt the people will "de light to honor" him hereafter. But we submit, that the humblest private is just as deserving as his highest officers, so far as bis ser vice in the Confederate army is concerned, and this people owe them the same debt of gratitude. But faithful service in the Confed erate army is not a necessary qual ification to make a just or good legislator or statesman. To our mind thirty-five j'ears of civil service much bettei befit a man for statesmanship than five years in the army. J2 We ask attention to the circular of Hon. Geo. W. Jones, in this paper. It is clear and ex plicit, and defines very satisfac torily his position on the questions likely to come before the Conven tion. He settles yery conclusively, also, the misrepresentations that had been published relative to his speech at the court-house on the first Monday. The report mis carriedit was started too soon, . thus affording opportunity for s correction of its misrepresenta tion's before the election. We ask everybody to read the circu-Jar.

The appeals made to tLe Con federate poldiers,to vote (or Col Hol man,by ht3 friends, would lead a stranger to infi r that thegentletnan whose name heads this article, was not only untrue to the South in the late war, but that he had failed to raise even his voice in behalf of the half-clad, half-fed and w ounded Confederate soldiers. While we deprecate that policy which would make military ser vice in the Southern army, chief lest of merit for civil the pro- motion, we can earnestly appeal al - so to the Confederate soldier and ask who was more mindful of .i,,,:. ...i tueir wants, who was more liberal i. . . , . ... m supp.ying ineir necessities, ana,am more opposeJ than to anotber who was more kind and merciful his the said Fifteenth Amendment. to the sick and wounded than Mr. 'By the provisions of that Amend- Jones.

There is no young man in the county forwhem we entertain a higher respect, than Col. D. W. Holman ; but the Colonel . should recollect that there are legislators and other officers to elect ; and we could take a great deal of pleasure in voting for him for these officcs,as we have done in times past. But in this instance, we have to form a new constitution, the foundation of our house must be rebuilt, and for such a labor, we prefer the man who has made statesmanship a study for thirty-five years, the man who through long years of service in Congress, has had to deal with just such. questions as will come before the Convention. ftg Last week we referred, in a brief paragraph, to our failing to have a County Court on the first Monday. Since then we have been informed that if a copy of the act had been received here, the failure complained of would have been avoided. We regret that a copy of it did not reach here in time. In our brief item, we had no reference to any individual member of the Legis lature. We did not know who introduced the bill, ncr who vo ted for it. The Radical candidate for Governor of Texas is elected. The 1 military controlled the mailer. To the Voters of Lincoln : County. Fatetteville, Tenxtseee, December 13, 1869. On Saturday last, at Pleasant Plains, I was informed that a re port was being circulated in that portion of the county, that I was in favor of negro suffrage. That report I publicly denounced as without foundation and false.' Since that I have been informed that there is another report in cir culation, that I am in favor of the proposed, pending, Fifteenth A- mendment to the Constitution of the United States. I am fortunate in having it in my power, and with equal truth, to say this report is also wrthout foundation and is ut- !terly falLsf- lf there isj an? one 'thing which has been done tsin.ee , , , . . , , -tine ciose oi me war to wnica l d consolidating, ultimately, all povver Keneral and domestic, in the Federal Government. To which I can never give my volun- tary assent. The pretended report of what I , nn Mnnjlv flia atU OTnf piinted in th.Lincoln Count; News." of Saturday, the 11th in- resentation. As a candidate for a seat in the proposed Constitutional Con vention my position upon the suf frage question, is, to Bujbmit to a separate vote ot tne people, the question of negro suffrage, thus affording to each and every voter in the State, to vote for or against negro suffrage as each one may determine for himself. At the ratification election, I will vote for while suffrage if in the mean time the fifteenth amendment shall have been defeated. I have many times been before this county as a candidate. This is the first time in thirty-five years that I have deemed it necessary, on the eve of an election, to adopt this means to deny or refute slan ders or falsehoods. I have lived in this county forty-eight years and the greater portion of that time in your servic, to little pur pose, if I have not established character for truth, honesty and candor, sufficient to commend me to your confidence and support I have never occupied a doubtful or equivocal position on any public question. Always a Democrat in the rrost enlarged andcomprehen sive sense of the term ; a Conser vative now and opposed to Radi calism and the Radical party in all of its measures. With me the public good is paramount to my personal success ur promotion. If I am beaten this time let it be fairly done, without misrepresenta tion or falsehood, and I shall be satisfied with your decision. Your ob't serv't, GEO. W. JONES. J$ When the ship is beset by storms, when the clouds are still dark and threatening, and we cannot see all the dangers that surround us, we want the old Captain who has long trod the deck and feels at home en it, to command the ship. This is our condition now. We are still in the storm ; the clouds are still heavy and ominous, and we know not where we are drifting. We want our Captain and helmsman then, the old, experienced, long tried and never-found-wan ting, honest, capable, safe statesman George W. Jones to lead u9. Vote for Convention and for him to represent us. 3 You know it vexes the ladies to have mean spun thread. I have got some thht they can work with and keep in a good hu mor. T. J. Gray.

The Unforgo'ttenFortDel awaro. The Clarksville Tobacco-Leaf mentions the arrival in that city of one G. W. Ahl, the man who was in charge of the Confederate prisoners at Fort Delaware during the war, and whose cruelty to the prisoners incarcerated in'that place was next to barbarism. He is on a drumming tour through the South for the firm of R. M. Pom eroy& Co., of Cincinnati. The Tobacco-Leaf refers to his reception in Clarksville as follows: He had not been upon the street long, however, until recognized by some of his former victims, in the persons of several young men, whose good fortune it was to sur vive the war, as well the more dangerous "reign of terror" under him at Fort Delaware, and in a short time he was waited upon by two or three gentlemen whom he once had the honor of tyrannizing over and the satisfaction of rob bing and abusing. ' Upon being questioned, he ac knowledged that he was the same man, Ahl, and the parties said they were glad of an opportunity of recalling to his mind a few in stances of the awful treatment they received at his barfds,as Con federate prisoners of war; and after assuring him that no violence would be offered him, proceeded to pass in review some of his cow ardly acts, to which he plead guil ty ; though he claimed that he was obeying Gen. Shoef 's orders. He left Monday evening on a south bound train. J5g In reading the Bible His tory of our first parents, we are for cibly struck with tbe fact that our good mother Eve immediately af ter eating the Apple discovered that she was much in need .of a new dress. Judging that her fair daughters of Lincoln county have many of the same wants, we would inform them that we have just received a large lot of the most fashionable Ladies' Cloaks made to order; also, Furs.Shawls, Hoods, Nubias, latest style of French Jelt and Gisela Hats no much spoken of in Harper's Ba zaar, with dress goods, Shoes, &c, &c. Not forgetting her chivalric sons, we have ready-made Clothing, Boots and Shoes, Hats, and piece goods, all of which we offer at lower prices than the same quality of goods can be bought fr at any other house in the county.

He favors the admission of Vir ginia again into the family of 'Qfntoa uurl of oonw) f !mo in A , r ly to induce her Legislature to de-!0r dare the seats of those members j a i- j i v ituuufc wuu ore meiigiuie uuuer his construction of the third' sec-j tion oftheFourteenth Amendment, and to admit the niggers who were cast out. "The freed men," he says, "u: der the protection which they have received are makingrapid progress in learning, auu no complaints are heard of lack of industry on their part when they receive fair remu neration for labor." The Nashville Hanner sums up the remaining leading points of the message as f ollows : He opposes immediate resump tion of specie payment and favors gradual resumption. To accom plish this he favors the redemp tion of greenbacks at a fixed price. As we understand it, his proposi tion is to use the cold in the treas ury in buyiug up the greenbacks, at the market price. He thinks the public debt could be paid in ten years, but doesn't favor it. He favors the lunding of the debt in bond1?, bearing a rate of in terest not exceeding four and a half per cent. In order to accom plish this successfully, he suggests that authority be given to pay the interest at one ot the money centers of Europe. He ftvors the postponement ot any legislation upon the tariff and internal revenue laws until the next session of Congress. He rec ommends a renewal of the tax on income?, but at the reduced rate of four per cent., to expire in three years with the funding of the na tional debt. To the Voters of Lincoln , crQty- in uiisvMi iu uiitiijr veiuai solici tations to become a candidate for rlolffrnfo fror tliio nnnftr in efinl "r,ll,u w icviau auu oiiiuiu the constitution of Tennessee, in all sincerity I would say that it is a position and an honor not to be sought nor declined. It is a posi- posi tion cf trust and responsibility, second to none in the gift of a free people: If it is the will and wish of the people of Liucoln county that I shall serve them. in that ca pacity, and will so indicate on the 3rd Saturday in December next, the 18th day of the month, the time designated by the law for the election, 1 will accept the trust with its responsibilities, with an honest purpose and firm determin ation to discharge the duties it will impose upon me, faithfully and to the best of my ability. In the meantime should you indicate your preference for another to rep resent you in that body, jn any mode or by any means you may adopt, I will retire and cordially unite with you in the election of the man of your choice The act of the Legislature pro - i xi.. l ? til t vides, that an election shall be held at all the places for holding elections in the respective counties of the State, at which every male citizen who has resided in the coun ty in which he may offer to vote, six months next preceding the day of election, shall have the right to vote for Convention or No Convention, at the same time and on the same ticket, to vote for one delegate for Lincoln county, and one delegate jointly for the counties of Lincoln.Giles and Mar shall. If a majority of all the votes given in the State shall vote for Convention, the law provides that the delegates elected on that day shall assemble in Nashville, to revise and amend the constitu tion, on the second Monday in January next. The law cteo provides: "That the constitution or form of government which 6aid Conven tion may adopt, shall not be of any binding force or efficacy until the same has been submitted to and ratified by the people of the State, in such manner and at such time as the Convention shall pro vide." The whole sutject is in the hands ot the" people. It is their work. It is for them to decide whether there shall be a Conven tion or not.- The duty of select ing and electing delegates is also for them to determine, and finally they will have to ratify or reject what the Convention may do. Whatever they do in relation to these important matters will be cheerfully acquiesced in by me. Most respectfully, GEO. VV.
