Peace and good will with ' lunations of the earth continue unbroken, he TrL. and we should feel genuine satisfaction at ihe crowing spirit of fraternal regard and uni- - fleaUon in all sections of our country and tbe lifting 61 great public questions above party prejudice. Th Finance. - Beginning with the subject of the finances, -- the president says tat while the full effect of th legislation of the extra session has not yet : ttetn realised., what it has already accomplished assure V of its timeliness and wisdom. To IMt its permanent value further ttme will ' be setfatvea and the people, satisfied with Its oper- - at ana and results thus far, are In no mind to 'withhold from It a fair trial. The next ques : (ion pressing for consideration is that of tho enrreacy. wits the great resources of govern meat and with the honorable example of the past before us. we ought not to hesi" Sst to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obliga- - ' tioBS less onerous to the gorortment, and re vive our financial laws from . ambiguity and (kmht. The evil of the present system is ' found In the great cost to the government of jnaiataining at a parity with gold our different - forms of money, and the experience of the past ' jour years have demonstrated that this is not - only an expensive charge upon the government, but a dangerous menaco to the national - redit. It is manifest that we must devise " some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated redemptions. We have CMX),Ma,0Q0 of currency, vhicn the gov erament, by solemn enactment, hjs undertaken to keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem iagoM but the government, which must borrow t the gold. The law, which requires the payment eat of the treasury of redeemed United states notes, demands a constant replenishment of the cold reserve, especially In times ef panie and Insufficient revenue, and during the preceding administration (262,313,400 4H-per-cenU bonds were issued and sold to sustain the gold reserve and pay the expenses of the government in excess of revenue. Vniie It is true that a greater part of this Is used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable por " tion was required to maintain the gold reserve. If no further legislation is to be had. to correct this and the policy ct selling bonds Is to be continued, then congress should give the sec retary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or sfrort periods, bearing a less rate of - interest tan is now authorized by law. The president says: Recommendations. " I earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts Of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any United States notes are presented for redemp tion In gold and t-a redeemed in gold, suota notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid cut in axctiange far gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the . United States note prefers the gold '. and gets it from tho government ... ae should not receive back from t.9 govern ment a United States note without paying gold In exchange for it," That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv ing an interest bearing debt, a government . Dona, for a non-interest bearing debt, a United . States note. The government should be re lieved from the burden of providing all the avid required for exchanges and exports. This ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity - and sufficient receipts we may feel no immediate embarrassment, but the danger will be ever present. - The president 'nvltes careful consideration for the detail plan of the secretary of the treas ury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs - with him in the recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of their bonds deposi ted; that their cir- - eolation tax be, reduced to one-half of one per cent, and national banks may be established with a capital of rS.uui), He also recommends that the is.u of national bank notes be re stricted to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards and that they be required to redeem . Uteir p.otes in gold. , Tho Cuban Question. ' Turning to foreign affairs, the president de- . 7 votes muoh space in his message to a consider- atioa of the Cuoan question, which he says, is . the most important problem with which our - government is now called upon to deal in its . foreign relations. Summarizing the history of former outbreaks, the president comes down to . the present insurrection, speaking of its re . markable increase, its tenacious existence against enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property and the disregard or the civilized loUo of war on both sides. He says these conditions give rise to gravest a pprehensions. There is ao desire on our part to profit by Spain's mis fortunes, and we have only the desire to see Cubans enjoying that measure of self-control, which is the inalienable ritfht of man. Of the concentration policy of Weyler he says: "It ' has utterly (ailed as a war measure. It is not o.viiixe'i warfare it is extermination." Oar Government's I'rotest. : Against this abuse of the rights of war, the president says, he has felt constrained, on re peated occasions, to enter the firm and honest protest of this government. He outlines his instructions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon the Spanish gov- , eroment the sincere wish of the United States U lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and ; honorable to Spam and to the Cuban people. . It was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make proposals for settle ment and it was said that we could not contem- . piate an indefinite period for the accomplish ment of this result. The Spanish Reply. The Spanish leply to Mr. Woodford, was. In the president's opinion, in the direction of a better understanding. It admitted our friendly purposes and deep interest, and declared that . the new government was bound to change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end political reforms will be put into effect ana military operations conducted on humane lines. It was suggested that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant political reforms while the United States for its part should enforce neu tral obligations and cut -off the assistance which the insurgents, it was asserted, received from this country. Early and complete pacifi- cation is hoped for. The president declares that the Spanish dis . position to charge us with failure to meet in ternational duties is baseless, and points to the efforts this government have made at the cost of millions, and by the employment of the administrative machinery of the nation to per form its duty welL He also says that the fact that no military expedition or armed vessel has left our shores has been diplomatically . represented with Spain. Promising that throughout all the horror and danger to our . Peace, the United States has never abrogated . its right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the : president points out that, of untried measures, , . there remains only: Recognition of the insur ;. gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end - he war by imposing a rational compromise be- - tween the contestants, an intervention in faor of one or the other party. Mo Forcible Annexation. Bessys: T speak not of forcible annexa tion, for that can not be thought of. That by our code of morality would bo criminal aggres ion. Taking up the question of belligerency, the president quotes at length from President . Grant's message of December 7, 1875. wherein : ,. he declared that the condition in Cuba war ranted neither the recognition of independence nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds . tt moreover a recognition of bellig erency-,, .would confer upon neither , psrty to conflict a status not theretofore act , Bally possessed, while it would weigh heav ily la Spain's behalf, giving her the right to search on the hl.-h seas and extending her maritime - Jfsts to the margin of our territorial waters. or these reasons," says the president, "I . Jgsrd the recognition of the belligerency of ... jae Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter M deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty. : lae executive will take it." : Hopvfal Change iu Spanish Policy. iJF Pints the hopeful change in the Span is policy to the pledge of reform and to the osfement of the horrors of war as reasons !fs nlrvention on humanitarian grounds. at first acts of the new go ernment lie in the " J"001016 Ptns it has outlined; the policy of 5't and extermination has been reversed ?y oroadclemencles proffered; measures have. r- iS? t"1 relieve the horrors of starvatio n -V1 Ppwer of the Spanish armies, it is as-IS4- s to be used not to spread ruin and des , . but to protect the resumption of agrl- witttral industries.

Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Mar ry to be received as minister to 1 ic&fagna on account of the obligations ef that country to the diet of the OreiLer Republic of Central Amei ica. As there in no legal authority at present td accredit him to the diet, Mr. Baker, ttfe present minister at Managua, has been di rected to present his letters of recall. Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter is said to be likewise accred ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Re public, and his case is awaiting actionv The 2nearagiia Canal. Tho Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of largo importance to our country, and the promise is made of further reference to the subject which, 111 the report of the commission now at work, is sent to congress. International Bl-Bf etalllsm. The president says of the International mon etary commission that, notwithstanding dil igent effort, the envoys have failed so far to secure un agreement. Gratifica tion is expressed at the action of France in this matter in joining in our effects, and it is said that the negotiations are still pending Meanwhile the envoys have not made their final reports, believing that the doubts raised in certain quarters respecting tha feasibility of maintaining parity between gold and silver may yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes that their labors may bring about an interna tional agreement. Reciprocity Negotiations. Mr. Kasson, of Iowa, is said to be now con ducting negotiations with several governments for reciprocity arrangements under the tariff act, and it is believed that by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by the act, some griev ances of our own and other countries in our mutual trade relations may be removed or alle viated and the Volume of our commercial ex changes enlarged. The president earnestly urges the improve ment of our merchant marine, the inferiority of which, he says, is humiliating to the national aside. Protection of Seat Life Reference is made to the recent conferences at Washington on the subject of the protection of seal life, the results of which place beyond controversy, it is said, of the duty of the gov ernments concerned to adopt measures Without delay for the preservation of the herds. Nego tiations to this end are now in progress International Arbitration. International arbitration is declared by the president to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world, and treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without in any way imperilling our interests orSwor, will have its constant encouragement. The Paris Expoaltlon. A liberal appropriation is bespoken in order that the United States may make a creditable exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, in which the people have shown an unprecedented interest The Navy. Under the head of the navy, tho president points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure the armor for the three battleships "now building, which would be otherwise use less. He speuks in terms of praise of the qual ity of our ships, and thinks that the time has now arrived when 'the increase to which the country is committed should for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels Lack of JUock Facilities. He refers to the lack of docks, and urges that three or four of the largest docks be provided on the Atlantic, et least one on the Pacific coast, and a floating dock in the gulf. There should also be ample provision for munitions of war and an increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards, and as there are now on the stocks five large battleships it is recommended that an appropriation be made but for one more battle ship on the Pacitio coast Several torpedo boats are also necessary. Legislation Needed for Alaska. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for surveys and for the establishment of another land officu at some point in the Yukon valley, for which an appropriation is asked, Military force is also necessary and the estab lishment of some sort of flexible government. If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the miners be fully veri fied, every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. Affairs In the Indian Territory. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the Indian territory. The lare white element is said to be without protection and without schools or oth er rights of citizens; leading Indians have ab sorbed great tracts of lands and created an aristocracy, and the friends of the Indians be lieve that the best interests of the five cU-iiized tribes would be found in American citizenship. Failure of the Uanres Commission. Reference is made to the failure so far of tho Dawes commission to secure the consent of tho tribes to an extinguishment of tho tribal title and a division of the lands. It is said tha? should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree ment, that some legislation should be had by congress. s The Quarantine Lawn. The president approves the recommendation of the secretary of ih j treasury for an exten sion of the quarantine laws, and also suggests the appointment of a special commission to as certain the cau e of yellow fever. The Kansas Pacific Railroad. Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas Pacific railroad, it is said, that if no better bidder is received than the upset price fixe! by the court, the government would receive only 2,500,OOJ on its claim of nearly tl3,0 0.00.1. He believes that the government has the authority to bid on the roa.l, and has directed the secre tary of tho treasury to make the deposit of fyou,0(Ki required to qualify as a bidder, and to bid at the sale a sum t least equal to the prin cipal of the debt to tha government. Congress Should LejjiitlHle In the Caao. He suggests, however, that in a matter so im portant as the government becoming a possible owner of the railroad, congress should enaot some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him. however, that the government should not permit the property to be soid at a price less than one half the principal of its debt and less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal and interest. The Civil Service. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to he civil service, the practical im provement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discussion, and which has of la'.e year3 received increa-ied legislative and ex ecutive approval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded against; the examinations improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by living a hearing beforo dis missal upon all cases where incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done with out impairing tho power of re moval, one of the vital safeguards of the system. Much remains to be done be fore the system can be perfected, and the pres ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly included in the classified service, or include those which, in his judgment, will best promote the public service. The system has the ap proval of the people, and it will be hi endeavor to uphold and extend it. Ketreuchment Suggested. In conclusion, the president admonishes con gress not to encourage the increase of the esti mates for the maintenance of the government. They would admitof decrease in many branches and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopro priatlons within the receipts of the gOTern mentl and thus avoid a deficit. An Eplaod. "No John!" The words were spoken gentljr, yet firmly. Had I been older and more ex perienced in the ways of the gentler sex I might Tiave' known that the an swer was final. But I was young very, very young and I was vain enough to think that she would be unable to resist my plead ing. X entreated her to take back those cruel words; but she would not listen. I begged I implored, but she was in exorable. Yet she was kind. She mere ly told me that nothing I could say would move her. It was for my own g-jod, she said, and some day I would thank her for it. Her calm, cool manner angered me, and, forgetting the deference due the fair sex, I threatened violence. She looked at me reprovingly and shook her head. She did not fear me in the least. Torture beyond endurance by grief and anger, I burst into un manly tears. . At last she was aroused. Drawing herself up to ber full height, she said, in angry tones: No, John Eenry, you can't have another piece of pie, and if you don't stop that noise X'U pnkyou Cgdr S. Y. JouraaA,
