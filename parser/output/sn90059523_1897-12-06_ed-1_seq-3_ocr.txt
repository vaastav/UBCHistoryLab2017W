WINTER WISDOM. A Few Sngrsentlona That Will Aid Yon Daring the Coining Months. Don't be afraid of fresh air, but avoid draughts. Don't go out-of-doors for a second without extra coverings.

The faults of our brothers we write upon the sands, Their virtues upon the tablets of love and memory. The Minneapolis Lodge of Elks, No. 44, held its annual memorial service j in the Church of the Redeemer yester | day afternoon, and a most solemn and Impressive service it was. Honor and j reverence were fittingly paid to the ! cherished memories of the departed I brothers, and the watchwords of the order, charity, brotherly love and fidel ity, were deeply impressed upon the minds of the living. Every seat in the church was oe ; cupied, pews in front being reserved ' for the Elks and their friends. The ! rostrum was beautifully decorated with palms and chrisanthemums, and a j large American flag was tastefully draped from the choir loft to the plat form below. In front of the alter a j large open Bible lay upon a table which I was covered with a silken flag. Fine 1 music was a feature of the service. • The Appclo club of about forty mem bers rendered "Sabbath Morn," by W. Muller, with an obligato solo by C. A. Marshall. Oscar Seagle sang "Eternal Rest," as a baritone solo. Then fol ! lowed the impressive opening ceremony ;of the Order of Elks, with Exalted j Ruler A. N. Harrison presiding. The j opening ode, which was sung by the ! congregation, was followed by prayer j offered by Marion D. fchutter. The quartette of the church, consisting of Miss Redlon, Miss Stoddard and Messrs. Finel and Fisher, rendered "O Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem." Dr. Marion Shutter then spoke briefly, dur ing which he said in part: "We wel come your order and your friends to day. During the last summer we threw open these doors for a service for the living; we open them today for this service for the dead. As I turn to the pictured window upon my right I see there two figures, which, if I were go ing to make an address, would furnish j the discourse of this memorial oeca ■ sion. I see yonder figure draped in i the blue mantel, the head in a thought ful and reflective attitude, and in one hand a scroll. This figure represents Memory, and the scroll is inscribed with the virtues of those who have passed away. The scene behind is that of the sunset at evening. So this serv ! ice today is a service of memory. We ! recall today the virtues, the good deeds, the noble qualities of our broth ers who have passed away beyond the I sunset. This recollection ought to be j an inspiration to those who are left ! behind. The virtues of our friends, i the good deeds of those whom we have known, furnish one of the strongest incentives to righteousness, nobility and justice for ourselves. The old maxim concerning the dead, "Nothing but good," is not the invention of flat tery. It has its. rights in one of the j profoundest sentiments of the human heart, the conviction that only the things worth remembering will live, ' and that all the goodness, truth, up ! rightness and affection that there was j in the hearts of our friends will live, j while all else will pass away and be j forgotten. It is a noble sentiment that j enthrones only the good on the throne i of immortality." The memorial address of the service j was delivered by Frank B. Nye, who 1 said in part: I feel honored, and yet, looking at myself, I cannot but feel that you must be disappoint ed, for I come to you with no symmetrical or well studied address. It has been impossi ble to do this, but I feel that we may well trust upon such an occasion that our hearts may send to our wits the fitting words for an occasion like this. I would not give a gloomy address. I would rather speak of hope and sunlight and good cheer than to speak of despair, disappointment and sor row. I had rather look out on the landscape living, with birds, animals, musical with all nature's beauty, radiant with flowers, with the music of running brooks, with the beauti ful paintings of nature, her lawns, her mead ows, her foliage, her mountain streams and seas, than To look upon the dead level of the marsh, or to the land of despair. I am glad to address an order to which I belong, whose membership is mainly composed of optimists: men who look, with all their im perfections and infirmities, upon the bright side of human life; men who believe some thing; men who have faith, and hope, and love, and who feel the- ties of brotherhood, of kindred and of citizenship. The mysteries of death are no stranger than the mysteries of life. The scientist can ex plain death and its causes better than he can explain the bonds of human brother hood, and the love which is the well-spring of all noble and heroic action. He may stand upon the battlefield looking upon the dying hero and explain clearly the course of the bullet, with all of its physical effects, but he cannot explain the love which clothes the dying hero as the banner of beauty. You are members of a fraternity that be lieves in the human soul. No man or wom an have ever left their impress upon hu man history who did not believe in some thing; who did not see some star of hope through the deep and inpenetrable darkness, and who, upon the wild tempestous sea of human life, had not some hope that some day they would anchor in the harbor of the b'.essed. The human soul is not the Intel- j lect alone; it is will. The man we ordinarily call the man, the eating man, the trading man, does not represent the true man. When he represents the soul, whose organ he Is, we bend the knee in love and adoration to him. This power, shining upon the intellect, is genius; shining upon the will, it is vir tue; shining upon the affections, it is love. It is the very weakness and fall of man when he trusts the intellect alone. All true re form recognizes that it is only by the light and splendor of the soul that we can grow broad and powerful. This is true reform. All else is sham. Looking over human life, what is there if it is not this? How frail are the conditions of men. Man, boasted lord of creation, is after all the toy of every wind and wave upon the pitiless sea of human love. I am exceptionally glad to belong to a fra ternity which, in spite of all its faults which may cling to its members, believes in those principles which endure forever. Among the brightest wreaths .that entwine around our temple are the v#eaths we bring today in momory of the dead. We must have belief, faith. Good cheer is the watch word of this order. We 'believe in charity, we believe In brotherly love, in justice, and we believe In fidelity. Fidelity Is a virtue which seems to under'M" all other virtues. The man, woman or chi%, who is faithful, true to hi 3 friends, througi* disappointment, through hardship, and toiling along the path of self denial, amid a struggle and pain, but faithful to the end, is the person whose character has the bed rock upon wbi-^h may be built all the orna ments, beaut^s and splendors of the higher virtues. I would have the Order of Dlks study the lesson of charity; not mere pity, not more tdving, but the sharing with each other. It is not in means; it Is in the sunshine of that ■harity which we should expect in every- . lay life; th^; smile, the good cheer 'jf man kind, the welcome hand, the word of encour- THE SAINT PAUL GLO33: MOXDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1897. agement If we have not silver or gold to give. | This, I say, is the order of good cheer. We believe in hope; we believe in. the future, we cling with fidelity to that faith which says man is immortal, and which says his destiny should be grand and noble. That greatest of religious teachers, Paul himself, that wonder ful warrior, whose characteristics were so great in all spiritual teachings, and whose life seems to stand out like a mountain crag in human history, when in the dungeon under I the ground, said "Be of gocd cheer, for the i angel of the Lord has come unto me, and I have been told that I shall testify in Jerusa lem and in Rome." Out upon the wild sea in the shipwreck, when fear had overspread the crew, he said "Be of good cheer for I have been told that a soul shall not perish, although the ship may be lost." He who has taught true brotherhood of man, and whose lessons come down to us from across the cen turies, He himself, bid His disciples often to be of good cheer. When His disciples saw Him upon the sea in the tempest, and were frightened, He said: "Be of good cheer, it is I." In the very shadow of the cross, when His hour had almost come. He said to His few faithful followers: "In this world ye shall have trib ulations, but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world." In His supreme and divine triumph of the soul, He felt that He had risen above all earthly conditions, and had overcome the tribulations of the world. This being of good cheer, this smile and good cheer to mankind, means more than the mere passing hospitality of friends. It is the promise of a greater and a better life. This charity of which I speak is not mere pity, but it is that pity which comes in connection with the very principle of brother ly love which you teach. I firmly believe that at no age cf the world's history has there been such a general recognition of the universal brotherhood of man as there is to day on earth. Let us, as individual Elks, raise In our minds and hearts higher ideals for the fu | ture, keeping in view fideMty, brotherly love I and Justice, which are the chief corner stones ] of our order, seeking as best we know how to I inculcate principles, so that the fragrance of i our lives will be felt wherever we are. We i are men who come far short in our duties and privileges, and whose lives, when com pared with the higher ideal, are base and ignoble, but let us strive for justice, more I magnificent charity, and a stronger fidelity. Following this eloquent address, the quartette sang "O Lord, Rebuke Me j Not." Ray D. Finel then sang "Lead I Kindly Light," as a tenor solo, when , the choir sang "Guide Me, O Thou ; Great Jehovah." The closing ceremo- I nies of the Elks was then observed, | and, with prayed and benediction by ; Dr. Shutter, the beautiful service came ; to an end. ■ -> .

NEW YORK, Dec. 5.— A piot to b'ack mail Senor Don Eugenio de Faria Teixeira, a Brazilian millionaire, which had been frustrated by the central of fice detectives was revealed today by the preliminary police court proceed ings in the prosecution of William B. Turnbull, who claims to be an account ant, and William Alfred Gould, who has been known as .a Wall street speculator. The name .of Arturo Bal dasano y Topete, Spariish' consul gen eral, having been mentioned in connec tion with the scheme to extort the sum of $4,500 from Senor Teixei, a sub poena was issued for his attendance at the examination ifi the case of Gould and Turnbull, which has been set down for Tuesday. The prisoners w«re committed to the.J*ombs prison in - default of bail, and it is said that at 'the police court investigation Turnbull will become a witness for the prosecu tion, and by disclosing the full details of the conspiracy fasten the guilt on his confederate, Gould, and implicate the high Spanish government official. The money was demanded from Senor Ttixeira under the threat to publish "his life's history" • and the al leged fact thar he had vio lently assaulted his wife while she was in a delicate condition. The detectives had several interviews with Turnbull during the course of the ne gotiations to extort money, the amount of which was finally reduced to $2,250, and are in possession of the letters written to the Brazilian millionaire. Senor Don Teixeira, who is a widow er, arrived here in October, 1896, with his mother, Mme. Maria Luze Teixeira, from Spain. It was then announced that the Teixeiras intended to invest their fortune of about $50,C00,000 in this country. They spent $500,000 in the erection of a mansion at the corner of Westend avenue and One Hundred and Fifth street, this city. There mother and son have since lived quietly. Consul Baldasano comes into the case because of his friendship for Gould. He gave to Gould a letter of recommendation, which Gould present ed to Teixeira in applying for the po j sition of private secretary. When a ! detective, posing as the agent of Teix j eira, conducted negotiations with Turnbull, the latter brought Gould into the case. Then the detective in quired at the Spanish consulate con cerning Gould. The consul said that he considered Gould eminently fitted to act as secretary to Senor Teixeira. Senor Teixeira has a reputation as an artist. He painted the celebrated pic ture entitled "The First Communion in America," which took prizes in Par is, Madrid and Chicago. He is a first cousin of Dom Pedro, once emperor to Brazil. Senor Teixeira is reputed to own rich gold mines in the republic of Brazil. 

BRAVE SHERIFF OF RACINE. Han Chicago Murder Suspects "Sur rounded in a Hotel. MILWAUKEE, Wis;, Dec. 6.— Early this morning two men, suspected of being Christ Merry and James Smith, the much-wanted Chicago murdereis, were seen at Western Union Junction. News received here by the police is to the effect that two men closely an swering the description of the murder ers jumped off a freight train there and went to the hotel. Their actions arous ed the attention of the men at the de pot, and the sheriff at Racine was call ed. He is now on the scene with a large squad of deputies and has sur roundtd the hotel. It has been decided, however, not to make the arrest until morning, but the suspects cannot es-, cape, as their rooms are carefully watched. Officers in Chicago have been com municated with and will probably be on hand to 'take a hand in the capture of the suspects. -•*- _ — WHEN WOMAN IS THE MASTER. State of Affairs Predicted by One Feminine Anlho'rlty. Four ycung men witli the regulation foot ball length of hair, tan topcoats and hiuge chrysanthemums, were riding in a south bound car, says the Chicago Times-Herald. After an impressive silence one cf them said: "Cecil Paig nearly died last night." And the others exclaimed in one voice. "Im possible! Paig has never really lived." "He told me the scory this morning, and "I tell it to you as 'twas told to me.' Two stunning girls sat opposite to him yesterday on the Alley L. One girl— Cecil said— had the deepest dioiDles " "Mary Baldwin— l'll wager my Virgil to a Mother Gocse!" "The ether had violet eyes, and the book that fell from her lap was entitled, "Anchit History,' but the cover slipped off when Cecil picked it up, and inside was a novel by the uchess." "Kate Wells! I know her tricks." "He thought to himself, "What a pity that pretty girls are always empty-headed !' Nevertheless, he yearned to know what they were talking about. Suddenly the car stopped and this is what he heard: 'Believe me, Kate,' from the girls with the dimples, 'with men's every retrogression women advance a step. The predominance of the female mind over that of the male is marked by a combi nation of circumstances new to history. Have some more chocolates, do. Aren't they just too sweet?

RUDE. flflbLY Op TtfE BULLS DECIDED CHANGE FOR THE BET TER NOTICEABLE IN WALL STREET. ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH UNEXPECTEDLY APPEAR TO MAKE A STAGNANT MARKET ACTIVE. PACIFIC POLICY AS TO Cl'BA. It Encourage* Investors — Decrease of Silver Agitation Also Hopeful. I ' 1 Special to the Globe. NEW YORK, Dec. s.— ln his weekly report of the financial situation Henry Clews says: A decided change for the better has come ■ over the Wall street markets. I have repeat ] edly noted, in these advices, that the stock | market appeared to have touched bottom as I to prices; that, so far as respects intrinsic j elements of value, there existed conditions I which warranted a buying movement, but I that there were lacking certain elements nec i cssary to give the upward tendency a start- I ing impulse. • Just at the moment of greatest stagnancy , these lacking elements have unexpectedly ap . peared. Perhaps the more immediate cause of this change has been that the room traders : have found it impossible to any longer make i profits on selling, and therefore changed over ; to the "bull" side. This was a natural test i of the market, and the response has been a ! general increase of buying orders. The re- I sponse came the more readily because there j has been a steady mitigation of certain out side influences which have been tending to the postponement of operations. As the open ing of congress nears it becomes more evi dent that we are likely 10 have a business like session, with the sensational factionarles held in restraint and with a preponderating regard for policies and measures calculated to encourage confidence among the business I interests. Among the things which now are | considered as assured are the support of the j president's pacific policy on the Cuban ques ! ticn. a fair chance for the adoption of a | good bankruptcy law, an earnest attempt to > effect some real improvements in the condi : tion of the currency, though possibly not all : that some may desire, and an »£Lort to se ! cure some equitable adjustment of the rail i road questions. The marked public neglect of the silver agitation also warrants the hope thac that issue will influence congressional action less than has been generally feared. i The feeling in Washington among tie ar i riving congressmen is very confident as to • the abatement of the agitatjons raised by the I Bryan campaign of last year and the Increas ! ing desire of legislators to deal witli the pend j ing large questions in a moderate and concil- I iatory spirit, and I venture to predict that this disposition will gain ground as the ses sion fidvancps. These symptoms, coming to the surface at this moment, have an important bearing upon the tone of the financial markets, and have directly contributed to the revival of buying which has been apparent on the stock ex change during the past week. Ordinarily, December opens with a postponement of buy j ing operations, owing to the winding-up cf ac- I counts and the liquidations incident to the ; close of the year. Now, however, the situ j ation appears to be regarded as warranting a j departure from that usage, and operators j deem it safe to promote an advance prelimi j nary to the rise in prices that usually re- I 6ults from the largp dividend and interest i disbursements made at the opening of the* year. The result of this buying— a rise of P-j to 3 points— in some measure sets at rest the fear entertained in some quarters that the very large amounts of stocks marketed in September and October by large holders would prove a load very difficult to move in any attempted "bull" movement. The purchases have been double those of preced ing weeks, and the rise in quotations proves that the demand exceeds the supply, and no haste is shown to realize on the already good profits. One of the inspiring aspects of the j market is the appearance of large operators who have been cautiously standing aloof since their rcalizings of two months ago. They appear to realize that, with so many assuring factors in sight— such as the hopeful pros pects of congressional action, the coming great abundance of money at this center, the promise of a booming spring trade and the probability of congress making at least a hopeful beginning in currency reform — it will not to be possible to hold prices at the recent semi-panic level, and therefore the preseut situation affords a good opportunity for buy ing. We do not pretend to say how far this recovering tendency in prices may immedi ately run. Possibly the rise may halt until the president's message und Secretary Gage's j report have been digested, after which a j further advance may occur. But. in any j case, it would appear that purchases at the ! present range of prices will prove profitable. The concessions now offered by Spain to the pfopln of Cuba, conceding home govern ment to the island, will doubtless be recog nized by members of congress as sufficiently i liberal to merit their acquiescence, and iuas j much as this excellent result has been ■ brought about through astute diplomacy by ■ the administration, the inference is that the ■ president and his cabinet are well satisfied j with the liberal attitude now taken by the I Spanish government. The plan proposed for ■ the government of Cuba is, as a matter of j fact, in many respects more liberal than I that acorded to Canada or to any other of . the British colonies, and it would appear ; therefore that there is no longer any justi -1 fication on the part of the insurgents in con tinuing hostilities. A government such as 13 now proposed for Cuba, in the estimation of* ; fair-minded people, is undoubtedly the best i for them, for if an independent government ; were established on the island it would not ■ be likely to prove permanent, as it would i lack the necessary adhesive qualities, and cer tainly no one having the interests of this country at heart would advocate the? annexa -1 tion of Cuba and making the Cuban people ■ American citizens. There has been much ap prehension felt that the coming congress ; might evince a spirit of "jingoism" similar to thr.t of tho last regular congress. This should not now be seriously contemplated, as the release of the American prisoners, the humane treatment on the part of Gen. . Rlanco of the Cuban people, and the with drawal of Gen. Weyler since the last eongross is a revolutionary change all round, and one that cannot fail to be recognized as remov ing the sting from "jingoism." The people ought to be willing to leave the I entire Cuban question to the administration j for settlement, and have faith that the best I will be done for the interests of all con ; cerned in connection therewith. The true j course therefore i 3 for the people to pay ' as little attention as possible to floating rumors about what both the administration and the government of Spain are going to do or not going to do in this matter. President McKinley can be trusted to do the right thing at the right time, and if the situation is sim ply left to him and his cabinet associates all will be well. 

LONDON MARKETS. An All-Arouud Rise In American Securities. LONDON, Dec. s.— Money last week was | scarce and rates were firm. The prospect Is of further hardening. Business on the stock exchange was slack, but the tendency was better, and there were indications of a re vival of the speculative spirit. In the mar ket for home government stocks consols reached the record price of 114, but closed slightly below that figure. Colonial and mu nicipal securities were in good demand, and there was a general improvement in interna tionals, which were firm. The market for Central and South Ameri can securities was distinctly better. Eng lish railway shares were depressed, owing to the labor dispute, and suffered a general de cline of from 1% to 3 points. In American securities there was an all round rise. The market was hopeful, with an excellent demand In view of the improve ment of trade and the traffic returns. Union Pacific shares rose 2 points, Atchlson, Topeka & Santa Fe, %; Pennsylvania, 1%; Illinois Central, 1%; Lake Shore & Michigan South ern, l'/i; Northern Pacific preferred^ 1U; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, 1; Philadel phia & Reading Ist preferred, 1; Denver & Rio Grande preferred, 1; Erie Ist preferred, 1; Wabash preferred and Wabash de-benture shares, 1. Traffic returns caused a rise in Grand Trunk railway securities, ranging from % to 3 points. Manchester Markets. MANCHESTER, Dec. s.— There was a falrly good aggregate of business last week, but it is considered smaller than the week's out _put. The manufacturers did not share evenly In the orders, and some who are still look- Ing for business have accepted very low bids. Only a small business was done in yarns, and spinners are reserved because they prefer to wait for the final decision In the strike negotiations. Prices, however, remained firm. Much of the cloth business was hindered by the weakness of exchange, but China and India are bidders for large lines. Germany waa steadier, with considerable business do ing, but Austria continued depressed, with overproduction, especially In Bohemia. Ad vices from Rouen, however, show that yarns again moved freely there last week. I P^tORJA Castoria Is I>r. Samuel Pitcher's prescription for Infants and Children.

"I dine with forks that have hut two prongs."— Swift. There can be but little doubt that the table fork owes its origin to the pitchfork, yet it required 1,500 years and perhaps twice that time to (■■> Ive the idea. Forks ar^ a modern inven tion, when compared with spoons. The Irishman who defined a fork as "a split spoon" had a true idea of its origin, as the earliest ones had only two prongs. The first mediaeval mention of forks is at the marriage of a Byzantine inai dtn to the Doge of Venice in the elev enth century. In Venice this young woman ate as she was accustomed to do at home,, cutting her meat In a few small bits on her plate, and carrying it to her mouth with a two-tined fork. The Venetians regarded this manner of eating as a morbid luxury. It stems highly probable that the fork originated in the Byzantine court, j and theme spread westward. It was j not introduced into .England generally until about the latter end of the six teenth century, anil its introduction lies at the door of one Thomas Coryatt. Coryatt was the son of a prebendary of York cathedral, and was a member of the household of Prince Henry, the [ eldest son of James I. He published a curious account of a walking tour un der the title "Coryatt's Crudities Has tily Gobbled up in Five Months' Trav els in France, Italy, Etc.." wherein he speaks of an article called a "forke." It is certain that forks were in use In the early middle ages, but only to spit meat and toast bread. They were ! never seen on the table. In the four- ' teenth century Clemence de Hongrie j had thirty spoons and one gold fork. The Duke of Anjou. in 1360. had a fork. J The Inventory of Charles V. of France ' twenty years later describes two forks ! with crystal handles. With silverware worth a million, the monarch possessed all told only twelve fork«. The use of a fork was considered such a luxury i that many monastic orders feforhadc ' their members to indulge in It. Its use was considered effeminate and "be neath the dignity of a true man." Queen Eleanor, wife of Edward 1., had among her plate a fork of crystal j and a silver fork with an ivory and bf-ony handle. The Duchess of Tou ralne had only two forks, though she boasted of ten dozen spoons. As late as the sixteenth century forks were a great rarity. Queen Elizabeth was the first English sovereign and the only woman who used one in her day. Her nobles thought it was sheer affec tation on her part, and so great was the prejudice against their use, even by educated people, that an eminent divine preached a sermon about forks, saying: "It is an insult to the Al mighty not to touch one's meat with one's fingers." As late as the reign of George I. so little was known of forks and their use that few inns provided them for the use of guests. No one thought of carrying the food to th>: mouth with a fork until Queen Ellza^, beth set the fashion. In a little book entitled "Isle dcs Her maphrodltls." ridiculing the effeminate dandies of the French court of Henry IV., the writer tells how it waa forbid den on the fabulous island to eat meat with the fingers. "Every one was com pelled to get his food into his mouth with a fork. These forks kept thf hands of the diners so clean that no one wished water and towels between the courses. The performance was as good as a play." With the opening of the seventeenth century came the introduction of forks into France, Germany and England by the Italians. Louis XIII. used a fork, though his wife, Anne of Austria, ate with her flngera. To the genial Duke de Montausier do we owe, it is probable, the general use of forks. His wife was the beautiful Julia d'Argennes, daughter of the Mar quis de Ramboulllet. The marquis' house was the abode of the highest culture of the period, and, true to the Italian traditions of his family, the marquis always used a fork. As soon as the duke learned its use and saw its advantages he exerted his influence to encourage the use of forks among : the French aristocracy, and, as the What is first court official of Louis XIV., his lead was followed. Forks was first manufactured in England in 1608. Their use was didl culed by men of the times, who argued, that the English race must be degen erating when a knife and A spoon were not enough for u?e at the table. Ben Jonson, speaking of the manners of Venice, says by the mouth of Sip Politick Would-be: Then you must learn the use And handling of your silver fork at meals. This was written in 1607. and nino years later he speaks of them in Eng land: Sledge— Forks? What be they? Mccr — The. laudable use of forks Brought Into custom here, aa they are in Italy, To the sparing of napkins. Forks for green ginger appear in al most every inventory of importance. The will of Sir Hugh Willoughby, in 1443,. mentions "ij forks for grena gynger," and in 1500 "a pronge tot grene ginger" figures. There is nothing new under the sun, says the prophet; in 1515 mention \a made of a "silver .-;«>n<- wt a fork<\" and in 1554 "a spoone wi a lufJTe" end." In the strong box of Dudi. m Charlotte of Savoy were two spoons and one silver fork "for the- purpose of eating sugar plums." Thy fork for eating olives Malinger re© gnizea in polite society about 161 C: I have nil that's requisite To the making cf a s,ignu>r, And my silver fork To convey an olive neatly to my mouth. The use of dinner forks was now be coming general, and the for was add> ed to the knife ;tnd spoon which most persons carried with them for their use. The same knife, fork ami spoon served for the entire meal, sometimes washed and sometimes only wiped. The large dinner forks, now called "table forks," were introduced by the Duke de .Mon tausier, and were first used In France about 1645. The fork bearing the Mosgrave crest, with the mark of 1883, was dug up in the grounds of Eden Hall, England. It ranks as the most ancient English, four-pronged table fork known, and was probably made out of a spoon. In th-e olden days all forks were per fectly straight and two tined, later on j the tines were slightly b< nt, Boon three I tines became fa.<-hlonal>l<\ and about the middle of the last century four pronged forks came in use. The hand les of forks followed the fashion of spoons. Forks were not üb<-'1 in England when the Pilgrims set sail. In 1620 travelers spoke of the use of forks, Instead of napkins, in Italy as a "curious innova tion. _ HOIfOH EASILY SATISFIED. Frenchmen Vtuht <he I mini Hloiml lenM Duel.
