That seems to be the sum and substance of the speech of the Prince of Wales, about which so much ado is "being made. It would be hard to say which caused, the greater surprise to the prince's auditors, the fact. that he discovered they were sleeping or the fact that a royal per sonage had brains enough to make a creditable appearance as an • after-break " fast orator. -- . - . «» riiOTKCTJSG FREEDOM OF SPEECH The action of Judge Dunn, of Chicago, In ■ releasing- the employes of the Chicago American, imprisoned : for contempt by his associate judge, Hennessy, sustains . the position taken in the matter by the St. Paul Globe, and is an effective vin dication of the right of the public press to criticise the action of any court of justice taken on any proceeding brought before it. - . Judge Hennessy's action was utterly ■ subversive of the right of . free speech. If it were sustained there could be no . freedom of thought or speech on the part of citizens of Illinois. The judicial de partment of the government. of that state would be an autocracy, whose decrees must not only remain inviolate in them selves, but which, however adverse they might prove to be to justice or to a sound . public policy, necessarily remained un . amenable to public criticism or condemna • tion. " ■ > ■ . Judge Dunn bases his action on a well rccognized principle in the administra tion of representative institutions. It is fundamental that all public servants are amenable to public disapproval, as are the decrees of all departments of govern ment. To apply a different rule of ac tion to the judiciary is in effect to place the agents of the administration of the • law above the law itself; to ordain that popular government is the creature ratti er than the creator of the courts, and that a part of the machinery of that government is more sacred than the gov ernment itself. Every intelligent newspaper man and citizen recognizes the Impropriety of passing upon the specific acts of a court of justice while actually engaged In the trial of a given case. There never is any attempt made at such action on the part either of the citizen or the press. The courts are invested with the power to punish for contempt where their author ity is set at defiance, or where an effort is being made by unworthy and extra judicial methods to influence ita pend ing action. This right there is no dispo sition to question. The policy of the law la to invest the courts with plenary pow er of punishment, directed against those, individuals or public agents, which interferes unlawfully with its pre rogatives In this behalf. There should be no question whatever in such a case that the necessary conditions were realized bringing the administration of the j; law and the. courts, which are the ; agents jof such administration, into contempt, so as to allow' of the suspension of the right of trial by jury * guaranteed •, by state '-. and • federal constitutions alike.

The defiance of "International opinion which Lord Salisbury gave expression to in his Guildhall speech is not so remark able in itself, as it is in the confession which it embodies that the British em pire^ in its determined effort to annihi late the Boer nationality, enjoys the hos tility of the civilized world. Indeed there is more than even this embodied in the speech. It involves an admission that the sentiment of the nations toward Eng land is a hostile one, and that there is practically unconcealed enjoyment by them of • thw difficulties which press so hard upon the imper;al resources. This is an almost"unprecedented position for any nation to occupy. Outside of her own dominions friendship is to be looked for nowhere. The efforts made so per sistently to assert the friendliness of this people is an outcome of that desperate situation. Yet among this people England can find as little of genuine friend ship as she can nnij, anywhere else in the world. There are certain restraining influences Which naturally operate to prevent any expression of sympathy on the part of this government and to- prevent its action in any direction which might be construed as growing out of a desire to interfere in the internal policies of the British nation. The first of these is the national policy which' prevents the United States from interfering in the con cerns of European nations; and the other is, that which is universally operative— the palpable national impropriety of in terfering in a quarrel which is in no sense ours. Were it not for considerations such as these, or were it possible for the aggre gate opinion of the American people to find expression in any effective way, this people would soon assert its aversion toward the brutal policies of England in South Africa. There is a Tiote of national self-as surance in the declarations of Lord Salis bury which the world is no stranger to. It is warranted no doubt by the present situation of international politics; but no one, not even Lord Salisbury, can question the truth, that the Boers have been effective in demonstrating England's military vulnerability. The nation which is held at bay by a handful of brave farmers, as England has been held at bay for three years by the Boers, may well thank its stars that international con ditions are such as to prevent effective expression being given to the hostility which Lord Salisbury confesses to be entertained toward it practically by every nation extant. The present prominence of Young Cor bett shows that the training in life w.hich succeeds is more likely than not to In volve the use of a punching bag. 

GETTING TOGETHER. For some weeks past the effort has been in progress to bring together the leaders of the New York Democracy and if possible evolve from the meeting some plan of united action among the different warring factions. The defeat of Tam many hall is likely to operate very favor ably in this behalf. The defeat was con cededly due to the dissatisfaction and hostility of a good minority of the Demo crats of Greater New York. The result necessarily operates to unsettle the rela tive positions of individuals and organi zations within the Democratic party in the stat9. Several days ago The Globe felt called on to comment on certain views as to the desirability and feasibility of party harmony which had been expressed by Mr. Prank Campbell, chairman of the New York state Democratic committee. In his formulation of what he thought necessary to harmony Mr. Campbell de clared that the first zequirement was that Mr. Croker should cease to be dictator of Democratic state conventions. Mr. Croker has since then expressed his views on the same general subject, and, to gether with Mr. Elliott Danforth, nation al committeeman of the party from New York, has evinced a strong disposition to insist on immediate steps being taken by the men of influence in the party in the state to lay aside their differences and unite for the common good. The movement haa plainly commended itself to the leaders all over the state, and it is believed that withVa a very brief time some plan of co-operation will be formu lated. ""he great need of the hour is party union. In the present demoralized situa tion of the party little or no use can be made of the splendid opportunities for promoting the principles of the party which the present session of congress of fers. The need of union is being gen erally recognized; and it is apparent that the old causes of feud are being steadily minimized, if not removed by the progress of events. Mr. Croker's view of the situation with reference to a reunion of party forces is well represented by the following extracts from a recent interview with him on the subject. He says: "The time Is ripe now for harmony arrong all Democrats. Unless the lead ers get together soon there will be little or no chance for Democratic success in the state, the nation or the city for years to come. It is time that all the state leaders should get together and bury their differences, and I think that this will be done soon. I am in favor of harmony throughout the party, and it w&r.'t be long now, probably less than two weeks, before the Democratic party will formulate a set of principles which will make a rallying ground tor all o£ THE ST. 

PAUI, GLOBB, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1901. the Democrats of the nation to meet on and to join each other on in harmony and with the determination to win in the next elections against the common enemy." National Committeeman Danforlh speaks with equal positiveiiess and seems to entertain equally high hopes of the .improved prospects,of agreement. On the general subject his published views are represented as follows: "The time has come for harmony in the party. By quarreling we have been playing into the hands of the Republicans and there is now a disposition a.ll around to get together. We see that it will be useiess to go into the state campaign next year without a united party. The Republicans are pretty sure to renomi nato Gov. Odell, and "he is not an easy man to beat. If we can't get together wo might as well give up the fight and not put up any ticket at all. On the other hand, if all the factions can get together we can win, for this is a Dem ocratic state. I am quite sure that a union can be effected in a short time. Tho Democrats are tired of playing into the hands of the enemy and they are going to stop the game." The second session of the Democratic congressional caucus will be held within a few days. That body, like the Demo cratic organization in the state of New York, can influence the party disposition to a degree that will be felt by every zealous Democrat in every section of the country. The presidential message, tak en in connection with the recent decis ions of the supreme court in the insular cases, shows that the amplest oppor • tunity is furnished to the party adher ents to come tog3ther and once more act in complete harmony and co-operation. We have an excellent minority, nu merically and in point of ability, in jthe two branches of congress. Of course, if we are to go on fighting each other, after the fashion which lias prevailed in New York and which manifested itself at t»he opening of the congressional caucus a few . evenings ago when certain utterly ill-considered resolutions were offered by the representatives ■ of the opposing schools of party belief, there is, as sug gested both by Mr. Croker and Mr. D^in forth, practically no use in going on maintaining a party organization or try ing to conduct a national opposition. The Globe looks forward with the utmost hopefulness to a speedy under standing being reached whereby Demo crats will again throughout the entire country be able to act in complete uni son, and with victorious results, as they did in 1870, 1884, 1892 and 1896, for the de struction of the prevailing plan of gov ernment through corruption and favorit ism. The beginning of Van's troubles has not yet been seen. Considering the de lightful non-partisanship shown by some of the Republican railroad -commission ers in sizing him and his plans and pur poses up, that nomination does not look appreciably any nearer today than it did two weeks since. TUB SUPREME COURT A\l> BPAIX. As time unrolls the scroll of events the world becomes more and more impressed with the superb intellectual ability dis played by the Spanish commissioners in that diplomatic contest which ended in the treaty of Paris. Spain was compelled to humble her pride before the-military and naval power of the Great Republic. But when the American peace commis sion, those tyros in diplomacy, headed by the country lawyer from Canton, Ohio, met the representatives of Spain at Paris, the Castilians won*more than they lost by the chance of war. Article IV. of the treaty of Paris reads: "The United States will for the term of ten years from the date of the exchange of the ratification of the present treaty, admit Spanish ships and merchandise to the ports of the Philippine islands on the same terms as ships and merchandise of the United States." This appeared innocent in itself. Ine Day commission had in mind the ex ploitation of the islands and forgot the fact that the United States was under a constitution which was not a creature o", but superior to, the conglomeration of mediocrity, known as the congress of tha United States. The object of Spain was to saddle upon the United States the burden of Philippine government with its interminable insur rections and secure, not only the twenty million good American dollars to pay her war debt, but also all the benefits of sovereignty, commercial free trade for a period of ten years. To correct the error of article 4, the administration conceived the policy of subverting the constitution; making of it a creature subject to the whims of con gress. It was a bold stroke, and so bold ly carried out that five of the nine judges were persuaded that it was good policy if not good law. With the question of expediency para mount to the constitution, the Foraker act, drawn on the theory of unequal taxa tion, in different parts of the United States, was sustained. No one doubted for a moment that the deciding judge was moved by political considerations. Someone must be vested with the power to undo the work which the blun dering peace commission had accomplish ed. The Faraker act was ephemeral—it would soon expire by limitation, and It only involved a fraction of a tariff, but the principle would remain—the precedent would enable congress to grain back from Spain what had been lost at Parts. The ten years of free trade which Sp.ain had counted upon could be made subject to the will of a co-ordinate branch of the government. The decision in the fourteen diamond rings case touches only the principle of United States sovereignly before any ac tion has been taken by congress. Any other decision would have been obiter dicta, but the decision in the De Lima case stands unreversed and the inference is that congress will at the present* ses sion hasten to enact such laws for the Philippines as to exclude Spanish as well as American products from the islands; for it will never do to allow Spain free ingress to the trade of her old possesr sions. In the meantime Spanish merchants importers of merchandise into the Philip pines for the last two years, will have claims against the United States for all duties collected by the United States or Fhilipp-ine customs authorities—and these claims will be paid. too. The discussion of the constitutional questions invelved in the first insular cases since the decision in the Downs and De Lima eas&s' were handed down has kept that question-still open. Should con gress rnact a Philippine law similar to.' the Ftrrkeract tk<s chances are that the supreme court w6uid reverse itself on the Foraker d&isioffffnd hold the act un constitutional, Jse personnel of the court is liable to .change any day. The end is not yet. a •-. -■ m Examiner' Popet^will do well to hurry up with th^t supplemental report on the street department. His present position on that subject seems to indicate that MeCardy may have something to justify holding up fiis bill.for services. The odds, however, ate that McCardy will do noth ing of the kind. Some of the. subjects discussed at the Episcopal conference at Rochester, N. V., were: "Money;" "Why Some Men do not Help," "New Fields," and "Our Publica tions." Surely no unbeliever will cry aloud when he reads this assortment of subjects "that the church is getting world ly. The fact that Judge Dunn released the Chicago American people seems to have received' as little attention from other papers and as brief space as it is possible to bestow on it without dismiss ing it entirely. This, it is needless to say, is due to the modesty of the calling. Chief O'Connor is said to have issued an order for the arrest of any small boys caught defacing trolley cars. The fact that the trolley cars have done quite their shafe in defacing the small boy does not seem to have entered into the "chiefs view of the situation, at all.

Will some able politician of a Republic an and philanthropic turn, for pity's sake, make up Gov. Van Sant's mind for him (if he can find it). One day there is to be an extra session sure, the next the chances are dead against, and thus are we k|pt on the ragged edge of suspense because somebody has apparently mislaid the governor's mentality, or perhaps it is that that backbone of which we have heard so much lately, has a crack in it.

"If the people of my dis trict are agreeable, I will try and repre sent them in the state legislature." For the last named office there are a number of aspirants, notably W. W.

It was a very neat "scoop" on the part of The president in thus shutting them off by supplying advance copies on the under standing that no intimation of the con tents of the message should be published before the message was delivered. All this is another evidence that Roosevelt is progressive and able to meet the ex igencies of his office whenever they arise. —Red Wing Republican. TUia Was Before Teddy Spoke.

JOSEPHINE TURCK BAKER. ARTICLE VI. The true function of language is to communicate thought. The function of grammar is to indicate those forms of language by which thought is most clear ly expressed. "Use Is the law of lan yuage," and usage regulates the gram matical construction of sentences and the uses and pronunciation of words. Gram mars and dictionaries record these forma and derive their authority and value from their conformity to usage. Much has been said in regard to good usage being the law of language. If by this is meant the usage of good speak ers and writers, then this definition ia correct. If, on the other hand, by good usage is not, strictly speaking, the abso lute law of language, for many forms used by good writers and good speakers are incorrect according to *the rules T>f language. Thus, many words have lost their original significance and have un dergone changes, and these changes, of ten in the form of idiomatic phrases, in correct according to the rules of gram mar, when once adopted by speakers and writers have in time the authority of usage and form an integral part of spok en and written language. The careful use of correct forms will preserve language in its purity just as the careless use of words will promote its deterioration. Many crude expres sions, slang words and phrases creep into one's vocabulary to the exclusion of cor rect expressions. Pure usage should be the criterion of examination each case, for, although one person cannot produce radical chang es, either for better or for worse, it Is the individual after all that is the prime agent in the promotion of change. Kach one should be the guardian of correct speech. The educated person should ex press his thoughts with ease and clear ness, leaving incorrect forms of expres sion to those who have not had the mean s of acquiring knowledge of these subjects. It is not the aim of this series of papers on "Correct English and How to Use It" either to promote a pedantic style of ut terance, or to create self-consciousness to such an extent that the thought shall be subordinate to the expression. The purpose of this series of papers is to in spire the reader to form the habit of us ing only those forms which best express hfs meaning and to exclude from his vo cabulary all faulty and incorrect expres sions. Let each reader assist in the pres ervation of the beauty, strength and purity of the English language. . Errors of the Careless Speaker. * It is the careless speaker who says: '"I can't hardly wait." "I don't hardly know." The person who makes these errors would feel aggrieved if he were accused of using two negatives. He Would never think of saying, "I can't wait no long er,'" and yet it is as incorrect to say "I cant hardly wait" as to say "I can't wait no longer," and "I don't hardly know what to say" is as incorrect as "I don't know no more." The correct forms are: "I can hardly wait." "I hardly know what to say." < It is the careless speaker who says "He hadn't ought to do it," instead of the cor rect form, "he ought not to do it." One would have difficulty in conjugating "I had ought," "he had ought." It la as in correct to use "ought" with "had" as to use "do" with "had;" as, "I had do," "you had do," "he had do." The person who says "he hadn't ought to" is on the level with the small boy who says "he cughtenter." Let us in the future" elimi nate "had" from the company of "ought" and use the correct form—viz., "he ought to do it" or "he ought not to do it." Errors of the Careful Speaker. It is the careful speaker Who errs in saying "nobody's else." Nobody else says "nobody's else," for everybody else says, "nobody else's." The careful speaker reads some nice little book on "What to Say and What Not to Say," In which the author warns the reader to beware of the fallacy "nobody else's." But everybody else who has not read "What to Say and What Not to Say" continues to say "no body else's," instead of nobody's else," until the careful speaker feels that he would like to buy a whole edition of "What to Say/ etc., and present a copy to each of his friends. In the phrase "nobody else," "else" is ordinarily an adverb, because a quasi adjective. The writers who object to "nobody else's" say that, inasmuch as an adjective cannot be put-in the possessive case, the possession must be indicated by "nobody." This would be true were it not fo r the fact that the phrase "no body else" has a unitary meaning, and in consequence the possession must be in dicated by "else," and not by "nobody." For those who have a lingering desire to cling to "nobody's else" the following rule is given: "The phrases anybody else, somebody else, nobody- else, etc., have a unitary meaning, as if one word, and properly present outlook. Yet Mr. Babcock, of Wisconsin, has no intention of receding from his position. He understands that the house ways and means committee will not report his tariff revision Mil fa vorably, yet he proposes introducing it and placing upon the Republican mem bers of the committee the responsibility of its failure. Mr. Babcock is not ex hibiting any partisan spleen in pushing his measure, as he is himself a Republic an in good standing—or who has been in good standing. He ia Just now being an athematized by his high protectionist brethren.—Sioux Falls Press. A Jfeiv Monroe Doctrine. The president in his message puts a new light on the Monroe doctrine, which ou&ht to make it more acceptable to European natio/is. He says: "It Is no wise intended as hostile to any nation In the old world. Still less Is It intended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring the .universal peace of th« world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere." —Red Wing Republican. He Won't Need an Excuse. Senator Quarles says that If Congress man Babcock is correct in his statement that steel billets are exported and sold in Europe at a cheaper price than is charged at home, the matter should be investigated and something done about it. Supposing such an investigation ha 3 teen made, and there is no question as to the facts, what excuse can Senator Quarics then make for turning his back on the Wisconsin Republicans who demand a modification of the tariff?— Milwaukee Journal. A Hot One for Loren. That is a great recommend — for a statesman. Representative Loren Fletch er, who represents Minneapolis in con gress, brags about being able to "get what he goes for," and promises more appropriations for dam building to make skating rinks and beating ponds in tSe Mississippi river between St. Paul and Minneapolis, under the pretense of mak ing the river navigable. What a farce it is and what robbery on the part of the cities. And what a recommend—that a member of congress "gets wthat he goes for" In cribbing cash from the treasury. A bright burglar with a jimmy might dp as much.—Waseca Radical. Tlte Tariff Situation. -Si The reciprocity question Is inseparable : from the [ tariff question, and jist in reality ; a part of it. There t can be no enlarge ment of f reciprocal trad© relations with- take a possessive case (with the suffix: at the end of the phrase); as, this is no body's else's hat: nobody else'a children act so." Should and Would. Should and would are subject to some of the same rules as shall and will: "I shall," "you will," "h« will," are the correct form to indicate futurity when there is no volition on the part of the speaker. "I should," "you* would," "ha would," are the corresponding forma which indicate past time. Futurity—Shall and will, followed by the infinitive without "to," form the fu ture tenses in the indicative mood. "Volition means the act of willing. Tn~ the forms "I shall," "you will," "he will," the first person neither asserts his will nor controls the will of the second or third person. "I should like to see him" is correct, because there is no volition on the part of the speaker. "I should" expresses a condition beyond the control of the win. "If I were you I would study' French' is correct, because plan is expressed by "I should." "It would be my plan to study French." Plan is expressed in tha * following: "If I were you I should go to town"; "it would be my plan to go to town." "If I were you I should accept tha offer"; "it would be my plan to accept the offer." "I know I should go," etc., is correct, because duty is expressed by I should. The meaning is, I ought to go; it is my duty to go. "He would go every day for his mail," etc., Is correct, because custom Is ex pressed by would. The meaning Is, it was his custom to go every day for his mall. "I would never give my consent" is cer- - rect, because resolution is expressed by "I would." The meaning Is, I have re solved not to give my consent. Custom is expressed by would. Duty is expressed by should. A Conversation. Mrs. A.—Since our last conversation I , think I have improved very much In my, English. I never say "I would like" for "I should like." nor "I will be obliged" for "I shall be obliged." In fact, I know,. I do not make nearly as many mistake.! as I did. j Mrs. B.—That Is encouraging, but yoii must not cay "I do not make nearly as many mistakes as I did." You shouM say: "I do not make nearly so many mis takes as I did." You must not use "as" after •'not." You should use ".so" after "not." You should use "so" after "not."' Whenever you compare unequals use "not —so." Thus you may say, "This room i 3 as large as that, but.it is not so pleas ant," "You are as tall as your sister^ but you are not so old." The rule is that "as" follows "as" in the comparison of equals, "so" follows "not"' in the com parison of unequals. Mrs. A.—Yes, I remember that I learn ed that rule in school, but I had forgot ten it. Mrs. B.—Someone has said: "What • tho world needs most Is not so much to be informed as it does to be reminded." Mrs. A.—Well, I shall try and remem ber, but people don't hardly ever observe that rule, do they? Mrs. B.—You must not sayj 'I shall try and remember." You should say "I shall try to remember." You would not say "I shall endeavor and remember." You cannot try "and" any more than . you can endeavor "and." "Endeavor" and "try" are verbs that require the in finite niood of some verb to complete their meaning 1. Then, again, you must not say "People don't hardly ever ob serve that rule." You should say "Peopla hardly ever observe fch«t rule." To say "People don't hardly ev"er observe that rule" is as incorrect as to say "No peo« pie don't observe tnat rule." Mrs. A.—l can't understand hardly; Why that is so. Mrs. B.—You mean you can hardly un« derstand why it is so. Mrs. A.—Now I think I understand it, but I must go now, as I am going to at tend a lecture in the Fine Arts building. Mrs. B.—You mean you are going to at tend a lecture at the Fine Arts building. Mrs. A.—Yes, and I must be there a£ 3 o'clock and it is now 20 minutes of 3. You see, I did not forget to say 20 min utes of 3 instead of 20 minutes to 3. You remember you told me about that the last time I saw you. Now, I have got to go or I shall be late. Mrs. B.—"Now I have to go," or "Now, I must go." "Got" Is superfluous In that sense. You must come again. Mrs. A.—Thank you. I shall be very pleased to do so. Mrs. B.—You should say "I shall b&* pleased to do so 7' or "I shall be very; much pleased to do so." Mrs. A.—Well, now, I must go, and I shall be very much pleased to call again in the near future. Mrs. B.—That Is right. Come soon, and I shall be pleased to give you any sug gestions that may help you. Mrs. A.—Thank you very much. Now I . { must go. Good afternoon. out some modification of the tariff. And most of this must be In the direction of lower duties on imports. We cannot eh courage foreigners to buy our goods by placing heavier duties on their. The sub ject has been argued, pro and con, for months, and It has been demonstrated that there are so many phases of It when details aro considered that the arguments might go on interminably without reach ing a conclusion. But there are a few facts which seem so self-evident that they must be admitted by all, and which . lie at the bottom of the whole discussion. —Grand Forks Herald. . Good Sense and Good Politic*. Tha St. Paul Glob© the past few weeks has asseverated again and again that It Is now a Democratic newspaper ' and will advocate the election of Demo cratic candidates. That ia enough. Who can ask more unless it be to wait and see? We shall take The Globe on Its word, without any probationary period. It has urged from day to day that tha great duty of the Democrats ia to get to gether—to let the dead past bury Its dead —and to work In union for success on living issues, of which there are enough. That Is the pressing duty of the present. New Ulm News. Straight From the Shoulder. Certainly Van Sant can beat Lind for governor again next fall. Why shouldn't he beat him?—Brainerd Tribune. Why shouldn't Van Sant beat Lind next fall? For the simple reason, dear Trib une, that ho> wil. not be able to get vctes enough. Van Sant's plurality at the last* election was, as everybody knows, less than the number cf ballots thrown oufc and containing the name of John Lind. for governor.
