He was presented, however, to the other members of the royal family, and , to many high mllitary-and court officials. j On account of the Secretary's ex-1 ! pressed desire that be be received unofficially, no salute was fired, but the reception was given a military setting by a parade and regimental festival jof the Semenoxsky Regiment, the ofil cm or winch attended the luncheon with Mr. Tnft.

At TsnrFkoe Sclo the party was met by a state equipage arm several court officials. The visitors were driven direct to the socnllcd "Little Palace," the residence ( 'f the Cznr. and escorted through, the1 palace with the usual ceremonial. "Secretary Taft was received by the; Czar in Ills private study. He questioned Mr. Taft concerning his journey over the Trans-Siberinn railroad, and drew n contrast between the present moans of communication and the method in vogue?three-horse sleighs and steamers acros the rivers and lakes? when hp made his trip across Asia Minor to inaugurate the trans-Siberian lines. The Czar showed a keen interest in the problems which the American government has to solve in the Philippine Islands, and he asked many questions concerns ine new Philippine Assembly. He referred, also, In a complimentary manner to the work done by the American government on the Isthmus of Panama In its light against yellow fever. Secretary Taft was the guest of honor last night at a banquet given by M. Iswolsky, the foreign minister, which was attended by the leaders of i the Russian state. The occasion was j marked by great cordiality and the oxchange or mutual hopes that the bonds of friendship between the two coun' trios would he strengthened.

The great butk of the re sources of the bank, meanwhile, is supposed to be placed in the hands of business people in the form of interestbearing loans. No. legitimate condition of business is ever going to compel [all depositors to make a wild rush at I the same time to draw their money out ot all the banks. ; . When such; a riisii occurs the reasons are psychological. People have I become panic-stricken with the Idea that the banks are unsafe, and that the; must get their, money out at the quickest possible moment." The money once out is, under such circumstances, hoarded until the people are In a different state of. niirid. They lock it up In sufo-deposit boxes;- or hide It in various ways about their homes. It is thus taken out of the channels of business circulation, and there ensues?if such a movement is t fde.-'.pread?a condition that makes v. hot is called a currency famine. A ;;reat part of the ordinary business of the country is carried on by mean^of v. hat is known as credit. Thus, in the autumn, nil over the country there are' I roiiucers of corn, whcnt, cotton, and other natural products who are in the habit of selling their crops at the nearest market town to dealers who pay them In. cash. Theso dealers in turn /iell to the large market centers, and the crops are thus distributed for domestic' and foreign use. This series of transactions, known as the "movement of the crops," rests in lnrge part upon the banks, which are accustomed j to advance 'the money with which to pay the farmers and the local dealers, j Tile crops are so vast and so valuable that the sums of money engaged in marketing them, are also enormous. hut the banks in turn are dependent upon their regular depositors for pv they are able to lend for the purpose of facilitating this vast crop movement and other analogous trans-' actions, such as the distribution of the winter's supply of coal, of dry-goods and general merchandise,- and so on. J And if people who usually deposit mon ey lu the banks are not only afraid to make fresh deposits, but are simultaneously scrambling to withdraw all that they have already deposited, It ( I Is evident that the banks cannot, with i their usuui confidence and * freedom, j supply the means with which to lubri-1 cate the marketing of crops, and the j distribution of other commodities. If | the banks are suddenly put In a condition where they cannot extend the customary credit to the manufacturers, the johers, and the mercantile community at large it is easy on reflection to see what a frightful check my be placed upon the ordinary freedom of the' so-called distributive process.

BUIIIC Bugpesllon for what he calls "extension of federal activity." Ills plans, for the regulation of railroads and of Industrial corporations through a federal incorporation law arc familiar to the public. Mr. Roosevelt entertains no doubt as to the existence of federal power to charter such corporations, and his conviction that the legislation he proposes would'bene lit railroad and other corporations is equally* prono, inced. New York Herald., Hpon many of the subjects dealt with In his unmercifully long message tho President, is either fraternallstlc or socialistic--fraternallstlc in suggesting federal. supervision of corporations and national Incorporation or national license for railways; socialistic in commending a federal graduated tax upon Incomes and inheritances. In shut, It is a very prolix and soporlflo message nnd?much of it being academic?it has the distinct merit of containing nothing to revive the disturbance from the effects of which the country Is now recovering. New York Evening Post. if nnj body looked for a retraction of the President's radical Ideas, or\even discreet silence about them, lie will be disappointed by the message'. They arc all there. Mr. Roosevelt Is still for widely extending and. vigorously exerting the powers of the federal government over rallronds and all other corporations doing an Interstate business. He has finally gone over to the Bryan plan (which Secretary Taft condemned) of malting railways and other corporations take out a federal license. New York Times. Wall street and the country receive the message as a conservative and chastened document. That thfe* President heeds even to this extent the criticism that has been visited upon him for his too frequent rashness of speech is of good augury. Nervous people have a right to take comfort from this evidence of the new temper that possesses hlm._ New York Tribune. Behind practically all of the President's recommendations stands the realization that regulation by the community and for the community is the surest means of curing the evils which have sprung from too great an effacemont of the state and too great an exaltation of the freedom of the Individual. This conception accounts for hi3 suggestions as to. the regulation of milrliids and trusts, the enforcement on the employer of enlarged liability. the Imposition of Income and inheritance taxes, the establishment of au eight-hour day for labor and the many other curbs sought to be put on ultralndividunlistic activity.
