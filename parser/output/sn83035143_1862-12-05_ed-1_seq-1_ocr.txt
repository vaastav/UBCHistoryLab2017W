Davit' negro was caught on the night of the 18th stealing blank sheets of notes from the Treasury i Department, to which he had access to .clean np the President's office. It turned oat that he acted to concert with other negroes. He will probably be hnng. The writer says he has heard of a young Kioh- tnona belie, about to be married, who paid $85 for one bonnet, $50 for a second, and $45 for a third. He is indignant at her extravagance. Fifteen thousand dollars hare been subscribed by the citizens of Richmond and others for the army. AH the prominent people paid readily, except Mr. Memminger of South Carolina, who denounced the moTement as a reflection on the Government" Jeff Davis, while handing in $50, remarked facetiously that he had two pairs of boots, one of which he would give, if necessary, and the other pair also ; but for the fact.that he had be come so nnaeoustomed to going barefoot, that he was afraid to attempt it in cold weather. Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. The Warren Chronicle speaks Tery en couragingly and flatteringly of the pro gress of this road. It says that but little more than three months hare passed since the location of the road in that part of the county, was made. Now the grading is finished (or Tery nearly) through the coun ty. The bridge across the Mahoning at Warren, is up, and the track will be laid overit this week. The bridge over the Mahoning at Braceville is also nearly com pleted; also that orer Duck Creek, at Learittsburg. The iron is laid from Ka ren na to Braceville, also from the Mahon ing Bridge in Braceville, nearly or quite to the bridge at Warren. The Chronicle adds : ("Teams are hauling iron from this place cast, and one or two additional gangs of track layers will be immediately put at work, (if they have not already.) A large, powerful engine is on the track, west of the river, which will soon be able to cross the bridge and render valuable assistance to the track layers on this side. There is scarcely a doubt but that before this month expires, the track will be com pleted from Salamanca, N. T. ,the point of junction with the N. T. & Erie, R. R., and Akron, and Warren will be less than 24 hours travel from New York." Brownlow upon Buell. Parson Brownlow, in a letter to the Phil adelphia Press, says that all that has tared Tennessee is Andrew Johnson, and not BoelL On this point the parson uses the following language : " General Buell want ad to anr lender Nashville three months go, and but for Gorernor Johnson, would hare done it. No man here can hear all the facts without arriring at the con clusion that General Buell feared his own personal safety, and kept his whole army bout him, as a body guard, to defend him. In other words he was so fearful of being whipped, that he would not engage in a battle at all. Another bad sign is that General Buell is the most popular man with the rebels that is in the United States army. They regard him as favoring a Southern Confederacy, and wishing to make the Ohio rirer the line. . How that is God only knows, but such is the opinion entertained by Union men." General Sam Houston. The Houston Telegraph mentions the passage through Brennan, Texas, of Gen eral 8am Houston, on his way to Inde pen deace, to g et out of the way of the "Yan kee inraders." He made a speech, advis ing that no more Texan troops be sent out of the State, but be kept for home defense. He denounced Hon. A. J. Houston, the Federal Military Gorernor, as a drunken rascal. He said he had been driren from his house and home, and had come back to Washington county, the cradle of Texan liberty, where he expected to lay his bones. General Grant's recent order, requiring that all traders in Memphis should take the oath, has caused much excitement there. Nothing can be bought or sold unless the dealer has taken the oath of allegiance. Incidents of a Printer's Life.

Riddle and Wade---Emancipation Triumphant---Black Flags---Foreign Intervention. Teottosu [Correspondence of the Cleveland Leader.] Natiokai Horn, Wahhihoto-', D."C., November 30, 182. f Well, here we are at the Capitol, with a clear blue sky and a warm red sun above us, which is ia fine contrast with the clouds of snow which filled the air In Cleveland as we took our departure last Friday morning. Every one instinctively says as he looks out' npon such a day as this, " What a glorious day for the great armies before Fredericksburg." By-the-bye, you may rely npon another fact, that the people will not watch in rain for ac tive operations on 'the Potomac, as they did through that pleasant weather a year ago. ! The city is full of strangers, and evi dently -of all classes, colors, and condi tions. The .hotels and boarding houses are crowded. Boarding is high. Provi sions are high. Fuel is high. ! Our member, Mr. Riddle, arrived last evening, and stop at the Rational. Sen ator Wade arrived this morning, and is also stopping at the National. Mr. Wade is looking very well, and if Ohio knows what is for her interest and that of the nation, she will re-elect him this winter. I tell you we want lion-hearted men as well in the councils ol the nation as npon the battle-field, and the approaching ses sion of Congress will conrince the people of that fact if they don't already know it Judge Worcester, of Norwalk, Mr. Edger ton, of Akron, Mr. Hutchins, of Warren, and in fact most of the Ohio delegation, hare arrived. The Avenue and Capitol Grounds hare been alire with people all day luxuriating in this "glorious old sunshine." The dome to the Capitol is nearly completed, improving its appearance very much. It has not yet been perforated with a shell by any of Jeff. Daris' horde of conspira tors, although to them the most coveted target in the world. The acres of white tents to be seen on the surrounding hills, and the vast armies between it and Jeff's minions, will probably present an obstacle never to be overcome by them. No; they will never get within gun-shot of the Cap ital. , Emancipation is triumphant ! The ball rolls on, and it will continue to roll on I No General can stop it no false Demo cratic party can stop it. I rerily beliere it to be beyond the power of man to stop it. ' - They may check it, ; they may turn , it aside for a moment, but it cannot be stop ped. The Lord has decreed that Slavery shall be destroyed in our fair land, and who is mightier than fie. The " pure cus sedness ' which has been instilled into the hearts of slaveholders by that corrupting institution, will drive them to such deeds of deprarity and wickedness that the whole cirilixed world will stand aghast shuddering with horror I The black flag will be raised orer battle-fields by them, and no prisoners taken no wounded spared no mercy shown I By it they will lose what cotton sympathy they now hare in foreign lands the Vallandigham De mocracy would say take all the Slare States and go, and peace be with jou, rather than do that, but they can't go in that way yet such a retaliation will be meted out to them by our own soldiery as will demonstrate to them that destruction to rebels will follow the black Sag. That miserable rebel, Jeff. Daris, as initiatory to the black flag, has just ordered one ef his generals to shoot the first ten Federal officers who fall into his hands as prison ers. The time will soon come when eren the present apologists of Slavery in the North will join in the work of Emancipa tion. Foreign intervention is not now feared in the least. The recent attempt of Louis Napoleon having so signally failed, it is now thought that matters will be left to work out their legitimate results without further effort of to mix in E. B. E. B. The Opening of Congress---The Seventh E. B. The Opening of Congress---The Seventh Ohio----Colonel Creighton and Captain Sterling. National Hotel, Washington, D. C, I Mi. j December 1, lSoi I saw Congress commence its session to day. The usual hum was increased by the cordial salutations of members until the clock indicated that it was twelve, when the rap of the garel of Speaker Grow was followed by an almost deathly stillness. The old Chaplain, with his locks of snow addressed .the Throne . of Grace, and as soon as he had said " Amen," dozen mem bers shouted from different parts of the Halt, "Mr. Speakerl" " Mr. Speaker 1" and the usual uproar prevailed. A communication from the Senate Bays they are organised, and hare appointed a committee to inform the President of that fact, whereupon the House does the same. In the meantime, little Cox of Columbus introduces a secesh bomb by way tf a reso lution censuring the President for arrest ing secesh sympathisers, and putting them in Forts and Prisons where their preach ings had no effect. Mr. Colfax promptly mores to lay them on the table, which is very promptly done by the yeas and nays. Old Ricaardsoa, of Illinois, follows op this bluff game by introducing a similar reso lution, only limiting it to Illinois butter nuts. It was summarily disposed of in the same manner. The President's Message is sent in, and the Clerk commences reading. I was in the Senate, as Mr. Forney, who by the way is an excellent reader, concluded the message. The galleries were literally jammed full, intently listening, and as the concluding sentence was uttered, a uni versal applause came forth, growing louder and louder until repeated raps of the gavel and sharp cries of order from the Chair man put a stop to it. I met Captain Sterling of our glorions Seventh, . lie is now serving on General Hooker's staff, and came from the army before Fredericksburg on Saturday. From him I learn that the 7th and CGth are to be consolidated, to be called the 7th, but the Colonel of the 6Gth taking the command. I can hardly believe such injustice to Colo nel Creighton can be done, for if any man has won his eagles by hard and honorable service, it is he. Captain J. A. Bennett,' an old Cleve lander, I have seen. He commands a bat tery " mit Sigel," now acting as a reserve. He baa been relieved to risit Lome, haring been away eighteen months. Ho is well E. B. Express Aoimct. Mr. James S. Lef fingwell has been appointed Agent of the Union Line Express Company, at Raven na, in place of H. -R. W. Hall, resigned. The office will be kept in the Rarenna pas senger station. Mr. Lef&ngwell is one of the most affable and obliging of men, and will make a good. . agent. Rmtmut Demo crat.

An amusing adventure is related as hav ing happened to the Bank of England, which had committed the great disrespect of refusing to discount a bill of a large amount, drawn by Anslem Rothschild, of Frankfort, on Nathan Rothschild, of Lon don. The bank had haughtily Teplied, " that they discounted only their own bills, and not. those of private persons." But they had to do with one stronger than the Bank. " Private persons I" exclaimed Nathan Rothschild, when they reported to him the fact. " Private persons I I will make these gentlemen see what sort of pri vate persons we are I" Three weeks after wards Nathan Rothschild who had em ployed the interval in gathering all the 5 notes he could procure in England and on the Continent presenting himself at the Bank at the opening of the office. He drew from his pocket-book a 5 note, and they naturally counted out 6 sovereigns, at the same time looking quite astonished that the Baron Rothschild should have person ally troubled himself for such a trifle. The Baron examined one by one the coins, and then put them into a little canvas bag ; then drawing out another note, a third, a tenth, a hundredth, he never put the pieces of gold into the bag without exam ining them, and in some instances trying them in the ballance, as he said, " the law gives him the right to do." The first pocket-book being emptied, and the first bag full, he passed them to his clerk, and re ceived a second, and so continued till the close of the Bank. The Baron had em ployed seven hours to change 21,000. But as he had also nine employees of his house engaged in the same manner, it re sulted that the house of Rothschild had drawn 210,000 in gold from the Bank, and that he had so occupied the tellers that no other person could change a single note. Every thing that bears the stamp of eccen tricity has always pleased the English. They were, therefore, the first day, very much amused at the little pique of Baron Rothschild. They howerer laughed less when they saw him return the next day at the opening of the Bank, flanked by his nine clerks, and followed this time by many drays, destined to carry away the specie. They laughed no longer when the king of bankers said with iron simplicity, " These gentlemen refuse to pay my bills, I have sworn not to keep theirs." " At their leisure, only I notify them that I haTe enough to employ them tor two months 1" "For two months I" "Eleven millions in gold drawn from the Bank of England which they have never possess ed! " The Bank took alarm. The next morning notice appeared in the journals that henceforth the Bank would pay Rothschild's bills the same as their own. Touching Farewell Address. Here is a rare bit of satire from Orpheus C. Kerr in the Sunday Mercury: But the whole body of Mackerels, sane and insane alike,unite in a feeling of strong anguish blended with enthusiasm, at the removal of the beloved General of the Mackerel Brigade. He has been so much a father to them all, that they never ex pected to get a step farther while he was with them. There's a piece of domestio philosophy for you, my boy. When the General heard of his removal, my boy, he said that it was like divorcing a husband from a wife who hnd always supported him, and immediately let fly the following farewell address: Hiasquastiu or Abut or Accomac, 1 Foot or tuf Blub Ripoe. t Mr CniLDSiit: An order from the Hon est Abe divorces us, and gives the com mand of all these attached beings to Major General Wobert Wobinson. Heartrend ing and enthuasastic cheers. In parting with you I cannot express how much I love your dear bosoms. As an army, you have grown from youth to old age under my care. In you I never found doubt or coldness, nor anything else. The victories yon have won nnder my command will live in the nation's work of fiction. The strategy we have achieved, the graves of many unripe Mackerels, the broken forms of those disabled by the emancipation proclamation the strongest associations that can exist among men still make it advisable that yon should rote for me as President of the United stats in 1865. Thus we shall erer be com rades in supporting the Constitution, and making the Constitution support us. The General of the M ackeecl Beioade. Green Seal. American Hopefulness. One of the American characteristics, which most surpresed Mr. Trollope, in his recent journey throngh this country, is the imperturbable good humor and hope fulness of the people. He frequently meets persons who are ruined by the calamities of the war. They never weep, or wring their hands, or tear their hair. One man, from whom the secessionists of Missouri had taken cattle and crops, and all the fruit of the labor of years, merely remark ed in a quiet way, while he picked his teeth with a bowie knife, " Yes, they have been kinder rough with me." That was all he had nothing else to say. Trollope thinks that a genuine American never complains and never despairs. " What ever happens in the external world," says Mr. T, "the man is always there." The Nightcap Brigade. [Nashville Correspondence Cincinnati Com.] The Nightcap Brigade was organized, and created great sensation in Nashville, day before yesterday. General Rosecrans, aggravated by .stragglers, who destroy dis cipline, prepetrate outrages upon private property and npon persons, and who are cowards, decorated about fifty of them with grotesque night-caps, made of white mus lin, frilled and ornamented with red trim ming, and caused them to be marched through Nashrille under strong guard, to the tune of the ' Rogue's March,", and then shipped them to Camp Wallace thus shamefully distinguished, directing that they should march through Louisville and to camp in disgraceful guise. All who disgrace themselves and the service by straggling and cowardice will hereafter be ignominiously punished. The scene was grotesque and humiliating, but this severe punishment will have a beneficial effect on the army. An editorial friend of ours was putting his little daughter through Prof. Royce's gymnastic exercises. ' Holding her up from the floor, suspended tij her hand from a ring, she suddenly "let go to laugV'as she said, and fell to the fioor. That reminds ns of the Irishman to whose heels another was hanging, who request ed him to "hold on tight" while he "let go to spit on his h&ni" Springfield N'ewi.
