Depart ment*. nceordinu to tenor or purpose. The i u)?jiri.?? I.taared. The ivf?-ivnee to Cuou is one of the string points of ?h? President's message. It is brief. but suftUi- ntly explicit. and it is ad mirably phrased. It comes as no surprise. b- ause ir t<?inports *ntir -ly with the Presi dent's character as a man, and with his previous deliverances on the same subject. Th? ? i. rif lit of cunning or bad faith does not ? nt'-r into the Pr* sident's composition. There has never been a day since he ap pr?? v. 1 of the resolution of Congress guar anteeing to the Cubans an opportunity to organize an independent government of th? ir own when he couM have been induced to depart from that position. P s a good thing at this time, however, for th? President to renew as he does his phage t.i the Cubans. Spanish sovereignty In the island is about at an end. and Ameri an ? Ofltrol Is to follow. The Cobsn^ nat urally. are full of curiosity as to the future. Sons. T.- very apprehensive. And the fears af the-*"* are being played upon by the selfish arid the unscrupulous. It is broadly hinted : hat American control will become perma ?:?>t through annexation of the island wh. 11.? r the people favor it or not. The President's word is sufficient in this ?.iness. Th?- Cubans may rest assured t ha* in the President they have at once ste j-ir'?si friend and a wise counsellor, and they . ould not do a better thing than to g'.ide r|os- ly by the lines of his declaration Hut if he assures them, he at the same time warns them. The length of the Stay of th? Americans in the island will de pend upon the- t'ubans themselves. That is the meaning ol" his words. A stable govern ment is required, founded upon humane and progressive principles. No revenges. N? Efov? rnment by faction for faction. All th< people of the island are to be considered Hi) i protected. In other words, what is to ake Spain's place in Cuba as a permanency xus? be the very opposite of that whicn ^pain provided and supported while she was n control. The task should not be a difficult one for he Cuban people after they have enjoyed a ?reathing spell. Among their leaders arr liany wist and capable and patriotic men, who. taking their cue from the President, leill loubtlesw exert themselves now to r?'de t heir countrymen in the right way. \ tiertuau I.anient. \ ). oiing tJfrman newspaper is of opinion that a big auction is in progress at Paris id ih.it s-'tne very valuable Spanish pos #es>io?is are going at a very low figure. It regrets that Germany is not a bidder, and de. laiv- that had she interfered at the prop*-! tim. between the I'nited States and 5pain she might aw acquired some choice rsland properties. She might and she might not. It all de pends upon the point of view. The opinion prevails in the I'nited States that there never was a proper time for interference !?. Germany in the quarrel between the i'nited States and Spain; that it never was possible for Germany to acquire islands in thai way. A tar likelier acquisition would have been a row of first-class proportions, into whit h Germany would have been none ;?k? well prepared to enter, arid from which she might nave emerged shorn of some of t>*?r own possessions. The German opinion which controverts this is not understood in rhn* country. There is no auction it Paris. The 5"nit d State.* is not bidding for anything Spain tins What it will acquire as the result of thos* negotiations it virtually already con trols. its terms for a peace treaty are generous, as they should he. but they are no* open to revision or objection by any eat side power. The I'nited States will pay Hpain twenty million dollars for better ments in the Philippines, but that is no bid Pads for tne Archipelago have at no tim* been in order. Germany could not hav. obtained the property had she raised that ligure fifty-fold. A more important and interesting ques tion than this relates to Spain's probable our>. r? spec ting the island possessions she will retain after her commissioners have Signed away those now demanded by the I rated States. An auction is suggested with regard to th m. Wit! she hang om th. red t'.. s and put ti.em up? And. if so. what will the p.?wers have to say on the subject?

MutlytBK F.hkIUIi MetliodM. "i'h siirgeon general of the army will ?- nd i commission to Kingston. Jamaica, to Investigate "the Pritish methoil of taring for trooj?s in tropica I climates. The infor mation is to be applied in <*uba and Porto Rico. This is a timely ami most intelligent l?roceedii;g, and the good to follow will probably be very great. W~ i?hall gain by realizing antl confessing at the \ery outset that we stand in need ??.' a ?t?o<l deal of information on this suh J-ct. The held is a new one for us. and we must enter it at once. We have the facili ?i?!? for applying al! useful knowledge of -hh? kind. No government cares for its sol ?iiers more generously than ours. No sol Uers are worthier of such care. The men ?feo will garrison '*t:ba and Porto Rico have a difficult tank to perform, and ?houid be the objects of the best attentions it may be In the power ?>f this government to bestow. The Knglish have solved the problem ?iMKtfMfuby than any other people. Their achievements In the tropics have been as notal?le as elsewhere, anil thcv I have conquered the climate there to a de gree almost equal to the dominion they have established over the soil. The cost ha? lieen considerable, but they have paid it like men. They have demonstrated that th?j white man may make his home in t]ie tropics and have health there, and their record with regard to caring for troops un der a hot sun shines almost like the sun Itself. It is most fortunate for us that this rec ord exists, and that we may hope to inspect it In all of its leading details in the fash ioning of our own program. The English will be as glad to teach us as we should be to learn of them. They are glad to have us for near neighbors, and will be at pains to hc-lp the new settlers with kindly ?u^ g est ions. And if we are wise we shall fol low pretty closely in the path which they as pioneers in these mailers have opened. Our Philippine problem is one upon which they may throw a good deal of light also. They have done wonders in India, where , the natives opposed as difficult a question as the climate. While we hold the archi pelago we must give the people good gov ernment. and get, and keep, in touch with them on all matters relating to their inter ests and our own. M'iren find ConduitM. In the course of an interview printed iv yesterday's Star Commissioner Wight, dis cussing the question of overhead wires in Washington, expressed the hope that, this paper would "redouble its efforts for a com plete system of underground wires." The 1 Star has always been ready to voice the i protest of th" citizens against a continuance of the antiquated and dangerous system of j overhead electrical conductors, and it is gratified now that there is a prospect that Congress may be brought to realize the vast importance to the city of this subject. The assurance that the Commissioners will press the matter to the attention of the commit tees of Congress at this session is gratify ing. and The Star will most assuredly con tinue to present the conduit system's many advantages and the overhead system's many disadvantages as occasion may offer. The fight for conduit railways has been won, as The Star was recently glad to note in connection with the new work on the Eck ington line. But there still remains a large problem t?? be solved, the solution of which is nevertheless comparatively easy If Con gress will but assume that the interests tirst to b' considered in the premises are those of j the people and not those of the corporations whose wires now encumber the air and threaten the public. Senators and representatives should take note of the occasional demonstrations of j danger which the overhead wires present. Saturday brought forth two such. An elec tric lighting wire in some way grounded against a tin roof on an F street building and burned a hole in the metal covering and set lire to the rafters beneath. A telephone wire in Eckinglon sagged in the storm until it crossed a tire-alarm wire and shut out of service the boxes nearest the disas trous conflagration at the car barns, caus ing much costly delay and handicapping the tire service in its efforts to cope with the flames. In each case the existence of a conduit system would have avoided the evil. \o "Al^erimn" in the Menage. The New i??rk Herald today expresses its regret that the President in his annual message did noi specifically refer to what ir is pleased to term "Algorism." It doubt less means thereby to suggest that the President was remiss in his public duty when he failed to devote part of his mes sage t?? a discussion of the sorrows of the soldiers incidental to their life in camp and at the front This term "Algerism" Is in some quarters regarded as broadly descrip tive of a certain system or perhaps lack of system which has been charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the sol diers. The Herald seems to think that be cause the President is siic-nt on the subject he is disposed to cover up the record. This appears to bt an unjust suspicion. The President has taken steps to ascertain tlie reasons why the soldiers sickened and died ir. the camps and in the hospitals, why they did not have sufficient food and cloth ing. why they were at times without medi cal supplies, and why a good many un pleasant things happened which some peo ple believe to have been avoidable. He lias assembled a commission composed of intel ligent and a presumably capable investiga tors. who have been diligently at work for several weeks inquiring into every phase of the case which lies within their reach. Th' only question now to be met is whether the President, in his annual message to Congress, should have mentioned this un finished investigation. The Star does not think that he was called upon by any con sideration to advance the subject in this connection. To suggest that Congress might investigate the conduct of the war would be to discredit his own agency for barning the facts. To present an incom plete reference to the subject would doubt less lead to acrimonious and uninformed deb-11? . while the inquiry continued in pro gress. demoralizing to the army and doubt less as well to the commission and discred iting us unnecessarily abroad. Judging the future by the past. It Is safe to anticipate that when the commission has presented its report the President will be heard from in terms as clear and suggestive as those with which, in yesterday's message, he to d Congress the story of the war with Spain. Don Carlos will have to arrange for sev eral preliminary fighting numbers before he gets to the part of his program which is to demonstrate what he thinks Spain (?tight to do with the United States. Li Hung Chang has reduced polities to a science where it is not necessary for him to display the slightest anxiety concerning the welfare? of the Chinese working man. CoL Boos*veIt has been engaged in re form *00 long to overestimate the import ance of slightly wounding a professional I oliciti; n's feelings now and then. It would be humiliating to Spain's peace commission to find opposition to the treaty In this country more successful than its own. Mr. Bailey regards the opposition to his leadership as one of those far-ahead fore casts which do not count Tlie i oiidiiil Sj?teni an Snow Time. Paring the recent heavy snow storm in New > ork city the transportation lines w?re badly blockaded, especially thos^ which aTe operated by electricity. Ina< much a?1 th city of New York has always rigorously excluded the overhead trolley from its predrcts the underground electric roads are r.ow coming in for a certain share of criticism for their supposed in ability to opt rat? in a heavy snow fall. Thi< Is essentially unfair, for a reason which U easily made plain. When snow falls in a certain temperature, such as that which prevailed in New York th;? other day. it has a tendency to ni' lt Immediately upon touching the Iron rails of the car tracks, only to frcoxe almost as qnickly. thus producing a thin coating cf ice on the rails which forms a practical insulator. The New York electric-roads, and doubtless most of thorn- now in use in this country, are run upon the single cable system, send ing the current back to the generating sta tion by means of the rails. When the rails are coated with ice this return Is impossi ble, the current l? checked and the cat stops. The same thing happens to the overhead trolley roads. In fact to any road which runs by electricity and Completes the circuit by means of the rails and the earth. So I ha*. lh? ?topp*f? of conduit roads by the snow In no wise bear.-* upon the ef ficiency of the system, which, under dif f< rent circumstances, has been found to cope effectually with the elements, eve;, under severe handicaps. The real lesson of the snow storm in New York and the con sequent blockade of the electric lines is that the roads should be equipped with the double conductor system, abandoning the old-fashioned and dangerous method of re lying upon the rails for the return of the current. It is the latter plan which causes the electrolysis in the cities, destroying wa ter and gas mains, killing trees, softening asphalt and even threatening the integrity of the sky-scrapers and bridges. If in ad dition to these items of destruction it ie* now found that the transportation system is in danger of being checked on this ac count whenever the snow falls doubtless the railway companies will be willing to adopt the costly but more reliable process of double conductors. Several gentlemen who have made it their ambition to subjugate Mr. Reed will be reluctantly obliged to delegate the enter prise to other and less experienced hands. Doubtless the Irish-American citizen would be more than pleased with an alli ance with England which would color that country's institutions with Americanism. ^ m It is claimed that the Klondike's gold cannot be exhausted. The same is, unfor tunately, not true of the people who jro after it. ? In seeking oratorical encouragement the Filipinos will remember that all insurgents do not look alike to Senator Mason. Governor Tanner of Illinois is said to have "a past." For exciting incident it can hardly surpass his present. Col. Bryan has managed to make a few speeches on the fact that he cannot talk at present. The President's message was not deficient ! in recognition of people who helped win the war.

Of the minor recommendations made by ['resident McKinley In his message to Con gress none is at once mor? time y and more mportant than his suggestion that the cen ennial of the founding of tin* city of Wash ngton shall b?- made a notable event. Only x little more than a year remains in which o accomplish that result, and comrnemora ions of a national character cannot be ar ranged in a day. The President recom iiends that a eonimittee to undertake the; management of the project be appointed ind mat Congress make an appropriation 'or the purpose. As the head of a nation hat is soon to celebrate so important an ?vent he could do nothing less. The President says but little on the sub ject. but it is obvious that he feels deeply. W ashington is today a beautifu. city, but t does not yet begin to do justice to the :reat people who own it as their seat of government. It is his idea that there should be some lasting memorial of the >ccasion, something which will teach com ng generations that the people of this age vere not without artistic aspirations and latriotistn. Had he argued for two or three such memorials he would not have gone .00 far. As he says, the people of the ?ountry are justly proud of their capital ?ity. and they have a right to be. Hut the vork of making that city beautiful has >nly begun. If an arch of any character be irected there, it should be one of Importance md of artistic merit. Those who would >rotest against such an outlay are of so ;ma?l a proportion of the population that heir voices would scarcely be heard, and ?ven if heard, would be of no consequence ?onipared with the overwhelming jentimenr n its favor. I^et us face this subject in a patriotic spirit. The erection of triumphal or histor cai arches should not end the work here ?ecommended. Paris is today the most >eautiful city in the world, because the >eople of France have spent millions of lollars year after year in adorning its Greets with just such memories as the ^resident has in mind. With its enormous ?esourees this nation should equal the re su ts achieved in the French capital. The loblest statues of our heroes should adorn nore of its prominent streets. Its rivers should be soanned by the most beautiful >ridges. Its streets should be further im iroved. if that is possible. A thousand rea sons for such a policy come easily to mind. S'o foreigner visits this country without visiting the capital and without returning .0 his own country to tell what he saw. S'o native citizen goes thither without hav ng his patriotism stirred and feeling more md more Inclined to light more determin edly for his country. These are the great ?easons for carrying out the presidential ?ecommeiidation. It need not be feared hat there will not be any adequate return or the amounts expended. The cost to so Treat a people would not be felt, and every where the effect would be to enhance the >restige of the whole people among the na ions of the world. It is hazarding little to predict that the committee for which the President has ssk.-'i will be named and that an gppropria ion will be made, but there should be no naif-way business in the orcmises. The 'omrm morition should be a notable one and ?should carry the fame of the Cnit^d States o the farthest corners of the earth. ? ? - l>uty of the Minority. Froni the New York Journal.
