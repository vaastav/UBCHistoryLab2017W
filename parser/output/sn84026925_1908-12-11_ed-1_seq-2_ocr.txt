Scraps and .facts. ? The withdrawal of the American troops from Cuba, says a Washington dispatch, will run into April. According to this programme American troops will be available for service In the islands during the transition from the provisional to the regular government and for a reasonable time subsequent thereto, so that if disorders arise they will be on hand for duty. One transport will be used in bringing the troops back to the United States and they will be landed at such ports as may be most convenient for them to reach the stations to which they may be assigned. The first of the troops will sail from the island January 1. ? Secretary Cortelyou announces that the Panama canal bonds have been sold at an average of 102.4368. The lowest accepted bid was at 102.2778. There were 1.79 accepted bids amounting to $30,000,000. Six hundred and seventy-six bids were rejected, amounting to $72,808,800. Among the successful bidders were: Fish & Robinson, New York city, five bids. $2,000,OOo; Chase National Bank. New York, three bids, a million dollars each; the National City Bank of New York, $10,242,760; Florida National Bank. Jacksonville, $100,000 at 102.55; Herman Myers, Savannah, (la., $100,000 at 102.46. ? Washington, December S: The Democrats of the house are planning to demand an investigation of the purchase of the Panama canal property and in conformity with this programme Representative Rainey of Illinois, introduced a resolution directing the speaker to appoint a committee of five to "ascertain how much of the $40,000,000 which appears on record to have been paid to the French company, was really paid to that company." It is said that the national Democratic committee requested Rainey to present the resolution. The resolution provides that the committee shall ascertain if any portion of the $40,000,000 was directly or indirectly paid to American citizens, to an American syndicate and if any member or senator profited by the transaction. Following the introduction of his bill for a searching investigation of the purchase of the Panama canal property, Representative Rainey made a demand on the interstate commerce commission to see the records in the case. Mr. Rainey says he will inspect the records carefully and see where the forty million dollars paid for the canal went to. ? Washington, December 8: President Roosevelt and President-elect Taft publicly put themselves on record today in advocacy of the issuance of government bonds for the construction of permanent public improvements to conserve the natural resources of the nation. President-elect Taft presided at the joint conservation meeting this afternoon at the Belasco theatre in this city at which President Roosevelt made the principal aaaress. Air. nwsevelt and Mr. Taft pave their unqualified approval for the carrying out of expert plans for conservation of the nation's resources. An audience, which filled the theatre and which included Andrew Carnegie, John Mitchell, senators, congressmen and the governors of several states, applauded every sentiment expressed. The joint meeting brought the members of the conservation commission and the delegates to the great Southern Commercial congress, the members of the Rivers and Harbors congress and others interested in working out a comprehensive plan for making the most of lands, minerals, forests and waters that belong to the public domain of the United States together. ? Union City, Tenn., December 8: Eight indictments charging alleged members of the night rider band of - * * 1 * ?? .... J /%?, tn fl I'c t Keeirooi iaKe vim muiuci m ?..?? degree were returned by the grand jury late today, the Indictments alleging that the eight men named, Garret Johnson, Sam Applewhite, Arthur Cloar, Fred Pinion, Roy Ranson, Bob Huffman, Tid Burton and Bub Morris had a part in the actual putting to death of Capt. Quentin Rankin at Walnut Log on the night of October 18, last. All of the men indicted today are under arrest and when their cases are called for trial tomorrow the prosecution will announce as ready. The defense, however, will doubtless ask and be granted a brief delay. The witnesses upon whose evidence the indictments were drawn are Col. R. Z. Taylor, the associate of Capt. Rankin, who narrowly escaped a similar fate, P. C. Ward, the hotel keeper at Walnut Log, Ed Powell, a farmer who declared that he was forced to accompany the band on the night in question, and Frank Ferrin, a member of the clan who has turned state's evidence and upon whose testimony the state depends largely for a verdict. Of the men indicted today, live are those whom Judge Matthews at Nashville ordered released under bond last week. ? Washington, December 8: A total of 11.010,864 baies of cotton ginned from the growth of 1908 to December 1 and 26,922 active ginneries against 8,343,396 bales ginned to December 1 last year and 26,854 ginneries ?i year ago were announced in the census bureau report on cotton ginned today. The 1907 crop was 11.057.822, of which 75.5 was ginned to December 1, the 1906 crop 12.983,201, were 77.2 to December 1. and 1905 crop 10,495,105, with 82.8 to December 1. In 1906 then* were 10,107,868 bales and in 1905 there were 8,689,663 bales ginned to December 1. The report counts round as half bales and excludes linters. It includes 200,818 round bales for 1908. 154,636 for 1907 and 227,145 for 1906. Sea island bales included 68,497 for 1908: 55,299 for 1907; and 41,250 for 1906. Today's report gives running bales ginned to December 1 and active ginneries, respectively, by states, as follows: Alabama 1.171.4U4 hales and 3,429 ginneries; Arkansas 776,153 bales and 2.073 ginneries: Florida 58,677 bales and 251 ginneries; Georgia 1.736,737 bales and 4,481 ginneries; Kansas and Kentucky and New Mexico 1,374 bales and 5 ginneries; Louisiana 397.179 bales and 1.645 ginneries; Mississippi 1,207,291 bales and 3,422 ginneries: Missouri 45.750 bales and 70 ginneries; North Carolina 554.002 bales and 2.681 ginneries; Oklahoma 432,077 bales and 973 ginneries; South Carolina 1.052,547 bales and 3.1S4 ginneries: Tennessee 278,679 bales and 625 ginneries: Texas 3.200,221 bales and 4.091 ginneries: Virginia 8.773 bales and 92 ginneries. ? At the annual dinner of the North Caro?ina society in New York last Monday night, president-elect Taft discussed the negro question in the south as follows: "We believe that the solution of the race question in the south is largely a matter of industrial and thorough education. Some southerners who have given expression to their thoughts seem to think that the only solution of the negro question is his migration to Africa; but to me such a proposition is utterly fatuous. The negro is essential to the south in order that it may have proper labor. Their ancestors were brought here against their will. They have no country but this. They know no tiag but ours. They wish to live under It and are willing to die for it. They are Americans. The proposition to increase the supply of labor in the south by emigration from Europe, it seems to me, instead of being inimical to the cause of the negro will aid him. As the industries of the south continue to grow in the marvelous ratio already shown the demand for labor must increase Primary and industrial eduea tion for the masses, higher education for t lie leaders of the negro race, for their professional men. their clergymen, their physicians, their lawyers and their teachers, will make up a system under which their improvement, which statistics show to have been most noteworthy in the last forty years, will continue at the same rate. On the whole, then, the best public opinion of the north and the .best public opinion of the south seems to be coming together in respect to all the economic and political questions growing out of present race conditions." <Tltr \torhvillr (fnquirrr.

YORKVILLE. S. C.i FRIDAY, DECEMBER II, 1908. Pkesident-elect Taft is to arrive in Augusta, Ga.. next week to spend a part of the winter. Arrangements have been perfected to keep him constantly under the protection of secret service officers. One of the most interesting discussions in the newspapers right now is whether Mr. Taft will be able to make political inroads in the solid south. Northern Republican papers are sure that Mr. Taft will be able to accomplish more than any of his predecessors have accomplished, and southern papers and politicians are sure that the effort will amount to nothing. Ir has grown rather common to hear people charge the present low price of cotton to the Farmers' Union. We have heard this charge coming from farmers, who no doubt made it in good faith. But before we would oe willing to accept the charge seriously, we would like to hear some of the arguments on which it is based. We are prepared to admit that in the holding movement fight, the Union failed to win. That fact is too clear to warrant dispute. But surely no one will attach blame for such a strong fight as the Union has made in such a commendable cause. Blame may lie against the Union for having raised such a large crop this year; but then the same blame will lie against all cotton raisers, who are not members of the Union. There is no good ground for putting the responsibility on the Union alone. Also it Is a fact that as .ow as cotton is now, it has been much lower when there was no Union. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the general theory of the proposition that so long as the entire cotton crop is held off the market, the price is bound to advance to a figure that the producers are willing to take. There is no j definite limit to that price under fifteen [ or twenty cents either. But neverthe.ess this holding movement has developed a lesson that ought to be of great value if the farmers will only grasp its real significance. However effective may be the holding expedient in ad vancing the price of cotton, it is pretty plain that to be able to hold cotton, the holder . must necessarily be the owner of it. He cannot hold cotton in which some one else has a preponderating interest. The thing, therefore, is for the south to produce no more cotton than it can actually own. Then inere will be no trouble about the price. It will be about whatever the producer may choose to ask. To Increase Earnings. Mr. Clarence H. Poe, editor of the Progressive 1-armer, was one of the opeaaers at the meeting of tne boutncrn Commercial congress, in Washington, this afternoon, and he outlined .-.oine of the plans by which, according to his idea, eacn farmer in tne soutn can earn $500 more per year. He hnds trom a census report mat tne average annual value of products per farm in tne North Atlantic states as $984. in the South Atlantic as $484, or exactly $500 per year less; in the North Central states as $1,074, in the South Central, $536?or $538 per year less. Broadly his scheme for getting this $500 a year more is a system of education which embraces young and old, not only the farm boy in the school, out the adult farmer and farmer's wife as well. Mr. Poe argues that every man whose earning power is below par, uelow normal, is a burden on the community; he drags down the whole level of life, and every other man in the community is poorer by reason of his presence, whether he be white man. or negro, or what not. "Your untrained, inefficient man," he says, "is not only a poverty-breeder for himself, but the contagion of it curses every man in the community that is guilty of leav.ng him untrained. The law of changeless Justice decrees that you must rise or fall, decline or prosper, with your neighbors. You will be richer for his wealth, poorer for his poverty." He does not think that the average business man in the south is half awake to the possibilities of this effort to bring the average farmer's earnings up $500 a year with regard to his own individual prosperity, and we agree with him. Add $500 to the earnings >f the southern farmers and the country would take a bound toward prosperity hitherto undreamed of. But there is much room for rural development. and perhaps Editor Poe is not taking too hopeful a view of the prospect.?Charlotte Chronicle, Tuesday. Intelligent farmers of twenty or more years' experience, have only to look back over a comparatively short time to see that their earning capacity has been steadily increasing, and this seems to offer about as satisfactory proof as one could desire as to general correctness of Editor Poe's theory. We are firm believers in the idea that the present and future prosperity of this country depends more upon agricultural development than upon any other possible avenue of progress. That the average farmer has many disadvantages to contend with, there is no use | trying to deny; but of all these disad[ vantages there is hardly one that will not yield to the application of better agricultural methods and the application of better agricultural methods is only a matter of knowing how. The average farmer jof today has information that the average farmer of twenty or even ten years ago, did not dream of; but there is no limit to the things that are vet to be learned. That limit will still be hardly less appreciable than it is now, even after the present producing capacity of the average farmer has been | doubled. Year's Cotton crop.?The total production of cotton in the United States for the year 1908-09 will amount to 6.182,970.000 pounds, not including (inters, which is equivalent to 12.920,000 bales of 500 pounds gross weight, according to the estimate announced by the department of agriculture last Wednesday. The estimate of production by bales gives. Virginia 131,000; North Carolina 619.000; South Carolina 1,118.000; Georgia 1.844.000 Florida 61.000: Alabama 1,273.000; Mississippi 1. 560,000; Louisiana 472,000; Texas 3,917,000; Arkansas 1,009,000; Tennessee 340,000; Missouri 54,000; Oklahoma 40,000. 

GETTING FROM UNDER. Trustees Wash Their Hands of Seminole Securities Company. It was the affairs of the Seminole Securities company and the Southern Life Insurance company that was referred to in the paragraph reproduced in the last issue of The Enquirer from the Spartanburg Journal. At least, it so appears from subsequent developments in the papers. Messrs. W. A. Clark, YVilie Jones and T. S. Bryan of Columbia are the trustees in a deal whereoy the Seminole Securities company purchased a controlling interest in the Southern Life Insurance company. Since the bursting of the sensation quite a number of startling facts nave come out. Garlington, the president of the Seminole Securities company, insists that everything is all right, and that if the recent purcnasers 01 oeminoie stock want to hold on to a good investment, they must sit steady .n the boat. Messrs. Clark, Bryan and Jones, upon the strength of whose names much of the Seminole stock has been sold, have become uneasy about the situation and have written an open letter to Garlington in which they charge that both the Seminole company and the Southern Life Insurance company are the victims of fraud. Their letter, which is dated December 5, but which was not made public until yesterday, is as follows: "Dear Sir: We have just learned from an authentic source that you and those associated with you received from the Southern Life Insurance company a very large commission, reported to be in the neighborhood of $70,000, for carrying through the deal between the Seminole Securities company and the Southern Life Insurance company, whereby the former company purchased of the latter $150,000 of the stock. This stock was purchased, as you know, at a very high price and we, as trustees, were informed that the money would go Into the treasury of the Southern Life Insurance company, so that the financial standing of that company would be increased and thus increase the value of the stock. It now appears that this much of it has been diverted. We regard it a fraud upon the stockholders of both of these companies and a flagrant breach of trust on the part of the officers of each ?ompany connected with this transaction. We are, therefore, unwilling any longer to be associated in any way with the affairs of the Seminole Securities company and avail ourselves of this first opportunity to notify you that we withdraw from any further participation in the affairs of the Seminole Securities company, and refuse to act any further under the agreement entered 'nto between the undersigned and the said company of date January 31, 1908. except as we may be advised to be oroper and necessary to protect the interest of the present stockholders or to enforce the collection of any causes In action which may have been placed in our hands by the Seminole Securities company, and further forbid that you, or any of your agents, should longer use our names in connection with the said Seminole Securities company. "Respectfully, "W. A. Clark, "T. S. Bryan. "wine jones. "Trustees." Since last January, Seminole stock has been sold extensively throughout he state, and there are perhaps several thousand dollars of it held in York county. Quite a number of railroad men are among the purchasers. There is a rumor that can be authenticated that the railroad people bought largely on the recommendation of a prominent gentleman who started in the race for the United States senate last summer. This gentleman withdrew from the race before the opening of the camoaign, and there are those who say that one of the reasons of his withdrawal was a direct intimation from the railroad people that they would certainly do all they could to get even with him for having induced them to make an investment in which they had already begun to lose confidence. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Long Document Illustrated With Photo Engravings. Congress was given an object lesson last Tuesday. President Roosevelt was the pedagogue and the subject was deforestation. In his annual message the president drove home his conservation policy by means of half-tone reproductions of photographs showing the shocking results of timber waste in northern China and eastern Asia all taken by a special agent of the agricultural department. This was the second time an illustrated president's message has been sent to congress. The former occasion was after the president's notable trip to Panama. The message was explicit. Adequate measures were urged for the proper care of the forests of the country,.for the improvement of rivers and harbors and for the conservation of natural resources generally. Large appropriations are asked for carrying on the work of the conservation commission, which receives a full measure of praise for the great amount of work it has accomplished in making an inventory of the nation's resources. The Appalachian-White Mountain improvement and the inauguration ot effective Federal control of the waterways of the country are advocated. But conservation does not take up all the message. As was to have been expected and in line with the policy of the administration, increased naval strength is urged. Among the other matters touched upon in the message are the following: Finances.?Seven years of Roose-clt administration show a net surplus of $100,000,000 and a reduction of taxation. Corporations.?Federal government should have complete control over an interstate business, railroad, telephone and telegraph, through the interstate commerce commission; but the companies should be removed from the domain of the Sherman act and be permitted to form proper combinations. Labor.?There should be a shortening of hours of all labor, abolition of child labor, diminution of women labor, a progressive inheritance tax, more extended industrial education and sweeping application of the employers' liability act. Courts.?Supreme court judges should have salaries doubled; remedy for intolerable delays of Justice and over regard for legal technicalities? should be devised; provision should be made that no restraining order issue, except where irreparable injury would result. Forests.?We have crossed the verge of a timber famine, but we can prevent further mischief, and it would be In the highest degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience interfere with such action. Waterways.?Action should be begun forthwith for the improvement of inland waterways, action which will give us not only navigable but navigatA/) ..IpaIH. cu i n ci o, Postal Savings Banks.?Recommen- I datlon for such banks, with govern-1 ment security renewed. Parcel Post.?Should be established on rural routes. Foreign Affairs.?This nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be done between nations as between individuals. Statehood.?Immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona. Hawaii.?Fortifications should be rushed to make islands impregnable. Philippines.?May expect independence in another generation. Army.?Promotion should be for merit, not seniority; officers who fail to attain a certain rank at a certain age should be retired; cavalry should be reorganized and infantry and artillery increased. National Guard.?Should be perfect [ ed bv details of regular officers; schoolboys should learn to shoot, j Navy.?It is desirable to complete as soon as possible eight battleships of the best type; the general board should be turned into a generul staff, as In the army: promotion should be for merit

Burgess of Sharon, has sent The Enquirer office some specimens of second crop apples that are very nearly mature. It is not too late to begin the making of a winning club for one of the handsome premiums being offered by The Enquirer. It is worth almost anybody's while to try. Most of the bird hunters insist that oartrldges are scarce. They say that there are fewer coveys and the coveys are not so large. There has not been i great deal of hunting up to this time. Mr. L. A. McGill of Bethany, sends 'nformation of three heavy hogs raised by negroes in his neighborhood. Sam McGill slaughtered a hog a few days ago that netted 412 pounds; Monroe Lowry slaughtered one that netted 369 pounds, and Rufus Adams slaughtered one that netted 335 pounds.

Wood, who was one of the competitors in the Farmers' Union prize acre contest and whose best acre yielded 61 bushels and 34 pounds, has furnished The Enquirer with a statement of expenses and receipts which show a clear profit of $48.94 cents an acre. The statement which includes both acres is as follows: Expenses.

The annual bazaar given under the auspices of the ladies of Trinity church was held in the restaurant room of the Parish hotel on Thursday, and as usual was a most delightful occasion. The bazaar was composed of a number of booths in which the ladies offered various articles of fancy work, candies, etc. They also had on sale sandwiches of various kinds, hot coffee, and at night oysters and other appetizing dishes. The bazaar was quite liberally patronized and the occasion was most enjoyable generally. The proceeds from the bazaar were quite satisfactory. THE SPECULATIVE MARKET. Following is a summary of yesterday's developments in the cotton market as given in an Associated Press dispatch of last night from New York: The cotton market more than lost yesterday's gain during the day's trading. closing barely steady at a net decline of 16 to 21 points. The market opened barely steady at a decline of 3 to 7 points with the active months selling 5 to 8 points net lower right after the call in response to disappoint ing cables and a growing impression that the trade was not crediting the official estimate of the crop. A rally of 3 or 4 points followed the Initial break as a result of covering and buying for a turn, but offerings became heavier again in the afternoon with stop loss orders uncovered on a scale down, and prices broke just about the low level of yesterday morning on the active months. Advices from the south, indicating that interior holders were not influenced by the government estimate but were offering cotton freely on practically the same basis as yesterday, were undoubtedly one of the factors on the decline. The market closed at practically the lowest prices of the day. Larger estimates for tomorrow's receipts at leading points were used to emphasize claims that the government's estimate of the crop was out of line with the movement and private cables from Liverpool stated that the official figures would have to be confirmed by future census and into-sight figures before they inspired much confidence abroad. Commission houses were good buyers of the late months on the decline. Receipts at the ports today 59.378 against 67,574 last year and 57,207 last year. For the week 425,000 bales against 459,291 last week and 368,793 last year. Today's receipts at New Orleans 7,763 against 15,787 last year, and at Houston 12.908 against 12.613 last year.

Although there are indications that the matter of building a modern county home is to be agitated, possibly to the point of action, Supervisor Boyd does not think the change desirable. Discussing the question last Wednesday. he said: "On its face, the proposition looks all right. I have no doubt that we could care for a given number of paupers in a modern home more economically than we could care for the same number under the present arrangement: but that is not all there Is to it. "It is pretty hard to get white people to go to the present county home. There is nothing especially attractive about the place; but with a modern hullrlintr. nrovided with all aceommo dations, the conditions would he more inviting, and I am of opinion that there would soon be a material increase in the number of inmates. People who are not willing to go to the farm would he glad to go to a modern home. "Then also, I think that a modern home, if we should go in to it, would cost a great deal more than most people are calculating on. There would have to be a large building for the whites and another for the negroes, and also one or more hospitals and probably a trained nurse or two. "There has been criticism from time to time, about use of the convicts in raising cotton on the farm. It has been stated even that the convicts have 1 been used to pick cotton. As I see it, the convicts have never heen used , ahout the county home farm except under conditions that were businesslike and sensible. They have certainly not been used to pick cotton so far as I have any information. And the .ittle cotton that has been raised on the farm has not had any appreciable effect on the market so far as anybody has been able to figure it out. As I see it. such cotton as has been raised at all has been raised at very nearly a clear profit, mostly with labor that would have otherwise been lost." As to exactly how many acres there are in the county home farm, Mr. Boyd is not certain. He thinks there are something less than 400. He Is doubtful as to whether it would be possible to sell the farm for as much as $8,000, and as he sees it, this would not he nearly sufficient for the erection of the buildings that would be necessary for a suitable modern home. 

FATAL ACCIDENT AT TAVORA. Mr. W. F. Downs, the well known machinist at the Tavora cotton mill, was Instantly killed at about 0.30 \r mnrrtlntr hv o r?r?lHon. u Viwvn ?cnin v?cvj uiv/i iniig wj uwiuvii tal contact with the 23,000 volts of electric current that supplies the power to run the machinery of the mill. The accident occurred in the transformer house at the mill. Something nad suddenly gone wrong, with the current, and Mr. Downs and Mr. J. T. Hamsaur, the superintendent had spent some time looking for the trouble. After making several tests they telephoned the Victor Oil mill, only a short distance away on the same line, and nnding everything all right there, could come to no other conclusion than that the trouble was in their own transformer house. Superintendent Ramsaur and Mr. Downs were in the transformer house alone. They had opened and closed switches and tried different wires. Mr. Ramsaur had just started toward the door leaving Mr. Downs at the transformer. There was a hissing, popping noise, and turning his head, Mr. Ramsaur saw Mr. Downs standing, holding a wire overhead with his left hand, and lire flashing at the point of contact with his hand and at his feet. The unfortunate man was unable to speak. He was completely paralyzed if not Instantly killed. Though almost transfixed with the horror of the situation, Mr. Ramsaur's first impulse was to rush to the assistance of his fellow-worker and friend; but Just before what would have been the last fatal instant, it occurred to him that to touch Mr. Downs would only mean death to himself and to no purpose. In another moment he realized that the absolutely necessary thing to be done under the circumstances, was to throw open the air brake switch on the outside. This he iCl'UllipilMlicu its nuuu ms pussiuic, auu with the current shut off, the body of Ylr. Downs dropped to the door. It Is very well understood among electricians that in the case of an electric shock, even by a current as powerful as 23,000 volts, It Is often possible to bring about a complete resuscitation. Mr. Ramsaur, Mr. J. Y. Lucas and others worked faithfully at the body of Mr. Downs as long ts there was any reasonable ground of hope; but without any encouragement whatever. There was some muscular twitching during the first few moments after the interruption of the powerful current that was passing through the unfortunate man's body, but no sign of returning life. It seems that there are two switches near the point at which the current from the main line enters the transformer. One is an air-brake switch, just outside the transformer house, and the other Is an oil switch, just outside the transformer. With the air-brake switch open the current is stopped outside the transformer house, and before it gets to the oil switch. The oil switch is on the same side of the transformer and is in the nature of a double precaution for the complete control of the current. Mr. Downs was a man who thoroughly understood his business. In looking for the trouble he had opened and closed both switches several times. A n-obable cause of the trouble, was that me of the conducting wires had pulled loose from its connection without ihowing Its disconnection. Where the wires were known to be live, their ' condition would be tested with a 1 piece of wood. In case of certainty that the outside switch was open, an Mectrician would have no hesitation about testing the wires with his hand, t is believed that Mr. Downs had for- 1 jotten the status of the outside switch, and under the impression that it was ( jpen, tested the wire with his hand, Mr. W. F. Downs, the victim of this deplorable tragedy is from Fort Mill. He was about 40 years of age, and has '' been the machinist at the Tavora mill for several years. He was a man of line intelligence, and excellent charac- 1 ter. He was sober and industrious and ' understood his business thoroughly. J He was held in high esteem by all who knew him. He Is survived by his 1 mother and a sister and leaves two i daughters. There was an inquest by Coroner 1 Louthian and a Jury yesterday and the facts developed as to the tragedy were about as described in the foregoing. l LOCAL LACONICS. 1 Cannon-Adams.

CANAL FREE OF SCANDAL. So Declares the President and He Threatens Prosecution. "If they can be reached for criminal libel, I shall try to have them reached," said president Roosevelt In speaking yesterday afternoon about, "those Americans who have been guilty of infamous falsehood concerning the acquisition of the property and the construction of the (Panama) canal itself," according to a Washington correspondent. It was to a committee of 100 of the lakes-to-the-gulf deep waterway association, headed by Governor Deneen, of Illinois, who were received by the president in the East room of the White House that he made this declaration. Governor Deneen had presented a copy of resolutions adopted by the association and made a few remarks to which the president replied as follows: i nave reii, as tne governor nas wen put it, that no more important service could be rendered to this country than the building of the Panama canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific; and one thing I am proud of in connection with the building of that canal is that there has not been legitimate cause for the breath of scandal connected with any feature of the proceedings. We have cause to be ashamed of only one set of Americans in connection with the building of the canal, and that Is of those Americans who have been guilty of infamous falsehood concerning the acquisition of the property and the construction of the canal itself. If they can be reached for criminal libel, I shall try to have them reached. If not, at any rate all the facts we know or ever have known are at the disposal of each and every one of you here, and of any one in congress or of all congress if they wish to see them. "Next only In importance from the physical standpoint to building the Panama canal comes the question of developing the use of our own waterways. That must be done by the policy of Irrigation at the head waters up in the arid regions; and where you come from, gentlemen, it is to be done by making our sea coast take a big loop in from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes-, and we will see that the work is done just as honestly, just as efficiently, as the Panama canal work has been done, and no work could have been done from beginning to end more honestly or more efficiently."

Columbia special to Charlotte Oberver: The annual reports of state officials are usually very "dry" reading', full of stereotyped expressions and set phrases hoary with age, large parts of them being merely revised from former reports to bring them up to the calendar year. Rut a striking exception this year will be the first report of the new insurance commissioner, Mr. F. H. McMaster, a former newspaper man who will make "live" copy of practically every page of Ids report. Of course fhe interest will be his comments on the outrageous graft that has been practiced throughout the state for many years on the poor and ignorant by numbers of irresponsible so-called industrial insurance companies. He commends the work of a number of honestly and ably managed home companies, but says their efforts have been greatly hampered by the piratical and i Irresponsible competition which ran on unrestrained by supervision," operating for the most part under eleemosynary charters In violation of law, one of these, a foreign company, claiming a capital of $200,000, a home office in a New York skyscraper and a J -.I~ ?*o t *1 AAA >'ov(ofunf oil UOiutrniHj mpuni ui f i ,wv

The commissioner estimates the total collections the past year amounted to $161,844, of which only $52,422 went to policyholders, the remainder being paid out to agents and for expenses. The hundred-odd companies doing business last spring have been reduced to twenty-three, many of the irresponsible ones fading away un- , der prospective investigation. But ^ strong remedial legislation is yet need- ^ ed to protect the public in future and encourage those honest companies which are doing a helpful work at home. ? Columbia special of December 8, to Charlotte Observer: The Seminole Securities company has an authorized capital stock of $300,000 and the president is Mr. John Young Garlington, formerly of Laurens. The company is not an insurance company and is not chartered to do an insurance business, it was advertised to be the original intention of the organizers to form the Sterling Casualty company, the purpose of which is Indicated by its title. The securities company was to finance j cne casualty company and fcr this pur pose the. stock of the security company was sold at $150 a share, par value 4100, the casualty company to be started with a surplus equal to haif the capital stock. Recently, however, the securities company advertised a change tn its plans and announced that it had purchased an interest in the Southern Life Insurance company, of Fay- , etteville, N. C., and that this company I would open headquarters in Columbia and do a life and accident business. Shortly after this announcement the life insurance company did open of- i fices here, in the Skyscraper, and the headquarters of the Seminole Securities company was moved to Chattanooia, Tenn. During the last year the agents of the Seminole Securities company have visited practically every portion of South Carolina and have jeen remarkably successful in disposing of the stock of this company at prices above par, in fact at $150 a share, payment being made in cash and notes. The solicitors of the company were several months ago taken off the road. As trustees of the company three of the most distinguished and trusted men in the state were named?Mr. W. A. Clark, president or the Carolina National Bank; Gen. Wl'ey Jones, president of the Palmetto National Bank, and Mr. T. S. Bryan, president of the R. L. Bryan company. The duty of these trustees was simply ^ to hold the money and securities own- " ed by the company, and the management of the company was the duty of the president, Mr. Garllngton, who Is now In Chattanooga, to which city he moved his headquarters after the purchase of the Southern Life Insurance company stock. According to the statements of the Southern Life Insurance company officials, the company on Julv 1st, 1907, had a paid-up capital stock ~>f $ 15H.700 and was pledged for $8,000 additional. In September, 1908, through Mr. C. J. Hebert, the Seminole Securitles company bought $155,000 of treas- J "ry stcck, increasing the paid-up capital to $276,700: and the Seminole Se- J curitles company also purchased from individuals $'5,000 of stock, thus giv- J ing the Seminole Securities company $150,000 of stock, on which $9,000 is still due. Of this stock 1,060 shares have been delivered and 440 are held. The Seminole company therefore has actually purchased 1,060 shares, par value $100 a share. For this stock the Quiit horn I.lfo Tn?nranr>? IVl.nnanv l*e ceived about $150,000 net or at the net rate of $140 a share of par value $100. For this stock, 1,060 shares, the Seminole Securities company paid at the u rate of $216 a share, or $228,960. The J difference between the amount paid by the Seminole Securities company and ?.he net amount received by the Southern Life Insurance company is $76 a share. On 1,060 shares the difference ^ Is $80,560; on 1,500 shares the differ- ^ ence is $114,000. Further, under the terms of the sale, the Seminole Securities company is obligated to sell the remaining stock of the Southern Life Insurance company up to $500,000. The difference stated above, $76 a share or $80,560 on 1,060 shares, represents the commission In the transaction. The stock of the Southern Life Insurance company is not in the name of the Seminole Securities company, but in the name of the three trustees. ^ Messrs. W. A. Clark, Wiley Jones and T. S. Bryan. Purchasers of Seminole \ V Securities stock say the elegantly \ V. Pressed agents from Atlanta, whom Mr. 1 larlington employed to sell the stock. m guaranteed them 12 per cent dividends certain with 20 per cent additional to go to the surplus fund. Further reve'atlons promise a big sensation throughout the state. Was Only Joking.?Our esteemed friend takes us altogether too seriously.
