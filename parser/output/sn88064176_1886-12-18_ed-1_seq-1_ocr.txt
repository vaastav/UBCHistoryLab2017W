Synopsis of the President's Message. Congress convened on Monday, Dec. 6th, and has got under good working order by this time. The following is a synopsis of Presi dent Cleveland's message: The United States is at peace with all other nations, aind enjoys great prosperity. Our citizens who have claims against Chili for injuries during the Peruvian-Bolivian war have not been paid for want of provsion therefor. The cruel treatment of the Chi nese in the Northwestern Terito ries is deplored and remedial or preventive legislatioi! recomended. The Columbia Government pro fesses its good will for the United States, without being able to allay the concern for American interests which has been excited on the isth mus. Future political combina tions at Bogota are expected to bring about a more satisfactory state of affairs. The submarine cable convention, signed at Paris in iMarch, requires Congressional legislation to put it into execution. Attention is called to the "diffi culties of sojourn," which natural ized Germans experience in return ing to the Fatherland, though the friendship between the two govern ments has remained unruffled. The fishery question is about where it was last year, the "high joints" not having made much head way in effecting a satisfactory un derstanding. They are still nego tiating, however and the President hopes for the best The President formally adopts Hawaii as "an outpost of American commerce," a 'stepping stone' to the growing trade of the Pacific. Liberia is included in the list of objects of Americam solicitude, on the ground that, like Hawaii, it is an offshoot or outpost, or some thing of that kind, and though we can hardly extend a formal protec torate over that part of the "dark continent," the colony should be "assisted in all proper ways," one of which, in the judgment of the President, would be to send a man of-war there to assist in protecting the coasting trade. The Mexican commercial treaty is urged for legislation to put it in to effect There is also need for a new contract with Mexico on gen eral matters, especially an enlarged treaty of commerce and navigation. The Cutting case is recited and ar gued at some length. The preten. tion of Mexico is mildly rebuked, but the desirability of continued peace with that country is affirmed in an earnest and sincere manner. The transactions with various petty governments of Europe are reported, most of which are of mi nor interest. Included in these are the negotiations relating to the Samoan Island; the misunderstand-' ing with Spain, etc., which have been given to the public in advance of the message. A revision of the naturalization laws is recommended; also an in- ° ternational copyright law. Legislation is needed to make 2 the consular service more efficient. a The financial part of the message i includes the information derived a from the heads of departmenta.. The only legitimate means eof dIealing with the large excess of E revenue over governmental requite- : ments is to strike at the source and t reduce the duties on certain claim of imports, viz,, "the necessaries a of life." The message elaborates the principle that labor and thie •apital invested in expensive mPI- d afacturing establishments should a mot be too suddenly or rudely di. turbed. The outcome is a recom- r mendation that the "necessaries of Life" and raw material be cheap. ned. The harshness of the mat- I ber is softened into "such imported material as by American labor may i be manufactured into marketable oommodities--e. g. wool, pig ir~oa raw sugar, etc. The public debt is being rapidly5 ixtinguished. The message reviaws at conside able length: the deptamental to. ports and concurs in the reeoi mendation s. The differences whiisprung up between the Postmaster Genral and certain steamshipie companiss relative to subsidieg, are reported b have been termnated by the so uieseoene of the later in the "poi y of the government as rpprved. y "Congres" and now the part-' ment enjoys the utmost service af forded by all vessels which sail from our ports to foreign countries. Additional postal service in lieu of the subsidy is recommended to stimulate commerce with South American ports. The recent decision of the Su preme Court in the Illinois railroad cases, involving the regulation of rates of freight is cited as showing tie necessity of interstate laws on the subject under the authority vested in Congress. In the same connection national arbitration laws in the interests of labor, or to set tie, where it may seem proper to do so, its difficulties with capital are deemed to be not only within the Federal power in certain cases, but are remommended as worthy the attention of Congress. The drift of the president's suggestion is that legislation should be franed to instill as much good will as pos sible into the respective contending parties. The new department of agricul ture, though, from the nature of its function yet to a great extent ex periniental, has so far proved satis factory, and promises to fully meet the expectation of its sponsors. Naturally civil service reform comes in for unstinted commenda tion. The commissioners are nam ed for promotion in rank to an equality with other officers of the goveriment having like duties and responsibilities, and it is intimated that an increase in their salaries and facilities would be a proper and j idicious exercise of liberality on ihe part of Congress. --4 Laborers in Council. CoLAX, Is., Dec. Ks IBa. Pursuant to call a large number of the citimens of Grant parish mt this day at noon in the court house at Colfax. The object of the meeting was explain ed- by Q. H. Thosus, constituted chair man, to be for the purpose of conmulting with the land owners and merchants, looking to some arrangement for seem ing better terms for land rent and leas exhorbitant charges for supplis farnish ed to laborers to make their crops.

While waitng for the committee to re. port, by request W. 8. Calhoun addressed the meeting, His remarks were fairly temperate and well received. The committee having reported, Col. E. OG. andelph spokd next. He exprrs-~ ed his willingness to make a moderate cohoeasiot in the matter of land rats, ad at the same time eouasled the laboaesr that reform was needed "all along the t line;" both as to industry on their part e and cheaper suppliim from the store keeper. ; His remarks received eathusias tic applause and had a good ed r Short speeches were also made by t Judge W. L. Richardson, H. G. Goodwyn e and Capt. C. C. Nash, thi last named giv- t ing it as hi opinio that the high chgar r es made by the m euanta has poasibly as y mah to do with Mthdhlnmtctiom of the n laborers as both bigll reuta and bad rops ii combined, and he thought it dsight and 6 proper for them to take steps toward bst tering their oondition. Marlow liagan and Albefd Mclauoghlin made good speeches and told their col- af ored co-aborere that while they could aot p expect to makilasdords sad m1rahante doetley a tbe$ tsd, still byeea- $ arted action ad statift besthr erths a eman force them into making r.eassable t reduetiona. a Judge W.
