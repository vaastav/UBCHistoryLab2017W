OPENING OF CONGRESS. ! THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE A REMARKABLE DOCUMENT. The Two Houses Draped In Mourning for JViee-President Hendricks The Silver Question Speaker Carlisle. Correspondence the Sentinel. Washington, Dec. 7.- Congress is here. The Senate and the House of the jForty-Ninth Congress have just gone to work. 1 he death of Vice Presideut Hendricks is still keenly ielt. Both Houses were draped two weeks ago. Not very long ago crape was likewise hung for Grant. But there was and is no one-sided mourn ing. Both lo-ses are common and great. Our noble Romans are broad- minded. We sit in the crowded gal lery, and behold Amei ica's represen tative intellect, the best, the greatest, the grandest minds of the Nation. No wonder citizens travel long distances to witness the American Congress. THE 

BUSTLE OF TO-DAY means no disrespect to the departed warrior and statesmen. Hurry, some times confusion, characterize the first day. The Senate has enjoyed the in troduction of several new-corners. But what paiu has been, felt in selecting another for the place death recently vacated ! Much unsightly speculation followed the loss, but it was not Sena torial. The true Senator is the true talesman. There are a few members of the Senate, to-day, never born to equal the grand, old Romans who are worthy of the name And so we must regard the House,' though in greater proportion. The toga fits John G. Carlisle like the gavel fits his hand. The details of organization, in both Houses, afford nothing new. Elec tricity will have carried the result throughout the civilized world before this is read. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE is the most important document sub mitted during the past quarter of a century. It comes from the pen of a President whose fearless, nou-partisan views, coupled with unusual common sense, com maud the respect of both sides. No time is lost in seeking mo tive. Grover Cleveland's motives are as self-evident as they are patriotic. Neither side has a shadow of reason to distrust him. He is as much the com mon President as he was elected to promote the common weal. And in this grand message, on which he has labored earnestly aud conscientiously, the "practical patriot can not be over looked. No President has ever more earnestly and practically sought the mutual patriotism of both parties, x et, here aud there, a skulking Democrat or a hardened Kepublicau doubt the motives and truths of one of the wisest messages Congress has ever heard. THB 

SILVER QUESTION is one on which both sides are pecu liarly . divided. - It seems "doubtful whtthcr an agreement will be reach ed. President Cleveland scarcely needs to define his position new. It will beiremeinbered that he long ago treated Mr. Warner, and his coterie, to an opinion on the subject. Seventy-five millions have recently entered the Treasury, and threaten to stay there. But Mr.' -Warner has under taken to present an avenue of escape. It is a matter of necessity ; Mr. Warn er's political life ilepcuds on the silver question. , - , " , . THE 

INDIAN tiUESTIOX is ono apjealing to thetheart of a just man like President Cleveland. - There. is nothing new in the qimstion itself; it has 'been worn threadbare. Yet no President has been mre prompt in taking the part of ftho Indians than Grover Cleveland. "Helen Hunt" Jackson .pursued a "beaten path" but she. trod with unusual firmness. F rout the Kick a poos dwn to the California tribes,: two liundred and, sixty thou sand Aborijfinees await justice. Pres ident Cleveland is not blind to the evils. Congress certainly ought to bo able to see. . . -.-, .. . THE 

CIVIL SERVICE QUE8TION has recei ved greater consideration from President vdevIand than even ex treme reformers had expected. -Aside From 'the question itself, one 'cannot fait to admire the unprecedented will with wliich President Cleveland has adhered to the law. History must re cord, though in dignified terms, that Grover Cleveland's -"backbone" was imroovaW-j. sThreats have been made on the eve of this session. But it is firobable that ail attempts to re-estab-ih political terrorism . will jrove fruitless, f; Terrorists may. as well ac cept the irWvitabTn. Cleveland is ofien to cHvjefcM'H, !ut he will never give the political terrorist another chance. ' .THK Ml, .1X1) DHL,

Criticism Versus Fault Finding. From the University Magazine. Nothing is more wholesome for men and institutions of public inter est than criticism a' fair and un biased consideration of their faults as well as a just commendation of their merits. Of all the detestable weaknesses to which unfortunate man is heir, none is more detestable, none more pusillanimous than the weakness manifested in this emotion of finding fault. There are men who would not be content to dwell in Paradisfi no opening for the ex ercise of their talents ! , . . .; If there is any one institution in our State which deserves the special friendship of all her sons, that insti tution is her University. IT not friendship, give her justice, at least. Let us do everything in a fair spirit. If you have an innate fondness for dwelling on the faults (?) of your surroundings, for heaven's sake keep it under control don't let it be seen by the world. Away with these puerile, groundless attacks on the institution of our fathers ! Earnest men are laboring in her interest, and earnest men will succeed despite the whinings and railings of those who rejoice in being inimical to the in terests of everybody except them selves. Cast out these evil spirits veny, covetousness, jealousy, and let peace and content and unity dwell in the hearts ofall ! Active Help Needed. From the University Magazine- To live is to strive to fight against misfortune to battle against storm and tempest o steer clear of the wiles and stratagems laid by foes and friends to stand up manfully against the enemies that lurk along the path of mortal pilgrimage. A troublous world, indeed, this, were there not friends by our side with sympathizing hearts and willing hands. But how many of these friends seem to be utterly powerless in every way except to give advice and make suggestions! Let no one depreciate the worth of well-timed, well-meant advice. Its value cannot be denied. But it must be remero bered that advice alone is of little moment to the discontented, unhappy man the man who is in trouble. There are too hiany of those who stand aloof, clothed in the mantle of their self-wisdom, and warn you d better do this," "better not do that:" of those who" wait till the end has come and say with a prophetic air- " I told you so," " I knew how it would be." Glad tidings do you bear to the sick - man when you ad vise him " to get well to the bank rupt, when you suggest that tis an unpleasant thing to be in debt." A happy message, indeed, to the drown ing man, were you to suggest that he " keep his head above the water and pull for the shore." A celestial balm it would be to the agonizing soul of the luckless beine who is slowly but steadily sinking to an irrevitable doom- m the devouring quicksands, if you should call out friend, you had better strike tor solid ground! What we need is more active help and not so much advise and so many suggestions. HIS DAY. . Another New Year, eh ? What's that to mo? I've seen a many on 'em. -ouhk and old And ain't no better oft for th-iu that's one. And them to come wont fetch me in no gold I Social gladness ? Humph! With these here clothes? This tangled heard, and these blear eyes o' mine? A gray old badger with the runiatiz An' manner that was never supernno ? My sort ? I aint no sort I'm all alone. There aint no fallow what would draw to me. To lounge about in some down-cellar dive Is all the signs home I ever see. , Qnite right yoa are. . It was not allez so. I don't pretend as how it aint my fault -That I sunk down from bad to worse nntU -I've got to where I'm now not worth my salt. ' But let me tell you this one thing right here, I don't go charge no woman with my case. Whatever else I am. I'm fair and square. And' dent go loiidln' her with my disgrace. Wife? May be she was. - What's that to you? She was a saint on earth not stiff and prim. But just a common goodness ev'ry day. Who never spoke a prayer or sung a hymn But did her duty patiently and meek, ' ' And took the good and bad with smiling face. I used to think the Lord used her to prove That evrywhere lie has a dwelling place. ' ' WelL when she died I lust let eo : that's all.
