TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1880. CHAS. H. MKACHAM - Without "running the thing into politics," the ecnato of Alabama has passed a general local option law. SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC j INSTRUCTION. Pine Timber In Prof. J. W. Rust, of Hopkinsville,' the Active and Distinguisnei Educator- Congress convened yesterday. The President's message was shorter than usual, containing only about 15,000 words. A fund to erect a monument over the grave of Chester A. Arthur has been started at New York and al ready amounts to $46,000. $100,000 is the sum to be raised. . : F. D. Carlcy and other parties, of Louisville, have bought the Kentucky Union Railroad for $000, 000. And wo didn't even know it was for sale. How provoking! If the Republican party of Ken tucky has to cry "Help Cassius, or I . sink," to that statesman of diluted greatness, Cassius ' Marcellus Clay the poor old concern Is indeed in a pitiable plight. The nine-mile railroad from Glaa crow junction to Mammoth Cave is now completed and we would suggest that William, the humorous ( ?) guide, might get off something fresh and convulse the next excursiou party by calling the cave a "nine-hole." Sam Walton, of Lancaster, has ful lowed Marshal Jack Gross' exampl and declined a good fat federal office, If this thing keeps on, Presided Cleveland may be forced to draft Kentuckiana into the service in or der to fill the offices. Mr. Dan E. O Sullivan, managing editor of the Louisville Commercial, was married Thursday last to Miss Bertha Bijur. The wedding was very quiet and was followed by a re ceptlou. They will board at the Gait House. The trustees of the National Sol' diors' Home, Boston, havo brough auit against Gen. Ben. F. Butler to recover $15,000 which it Is alleged he failed to account for when treasurer of the home. Wonder if they have couuted the spoons sinco he left? The Princeton Banner has discov erod in Gen. II. B. Lyon, of Lyon Co. the very kind of material of which to make an ideal Governor. Lyon coun ty has just beeu given the branch pen itoutiary, and if she bringBOut a can didate for Governor somebody migli accuse her of wanting a Lyon's share of things. Since Gen. Buckner has announced that he will not make a personal can vass of the state, the papers opposed to him have started the cry that he Is a "kid glove" candidate for Cover nor. It Is not a bad idea to let the office seek the man once In awhile. and if Gen. Buckner chooses to !r the experiment, he ought to be cred ited with honesty of purpose. Editor O'SuIlivan, of tho Commcr cial, was married last Thursday and there were so many other marriages to write up that the Courier-Journal hadn't space to give Daniel more than a one-line notice in the clerk's list of licenses issued. Somebody should take a bucket of oil and pour it on the troubled waters of Louisville journalism. A man registered as "Jim Cuin mings," at Parson", Kane., hotel Friday, and after eating his dinner walked off with the landlord's hat. Policeman E. R. Kyser was sent to arrest hi in, but the mysterious stran ger promptly shot and killed the po liceman for interfering with his lib erty and then made good his escape, On the same day poor Fotheringbam, the express messenger, was put in jail at St. Louis to await trial for the Frisco robbery, being unable to give a bond of $20,000. Only a day before another letter was received from "Jim Cummings," offering to give up $25,000 of the stolen money if (ho ex press company would call off the de tectives and let him go in peace. I Henderson Gleaner. The office of superintendent of pub lie instruction requires for the suc cessful discharge of its duties a man of practical sense, business sagacity, executive ability and of broad, com prehensive views of the aims and ap plication of educational system. With our large school per capita, it is la meutuble that we have such a defect ive system of common schools. The oublo is there has uever been had a clear view of our educational wants and necessities. We need at the head of our common school system a man who knows Kentucky and Ken luckians, who kuows the demands of the hour, who has an intuitive con ccptiou of and tho executive ability to apply the remedial agencies. ThiB no time for experimenting with nice theories. We want a man who knows what to do, how to do it and who will do it and who will do it quick. Such a niau is Prof. J. W. Rust, of Hopkinsville. He Is literal ly an educator from "way back." He was born in Logaucounty, feu. 14, 1819. Tho first fifteen years of his life were spent on a farm. Early in life the ambition to be and to do something became manifested iu him. A few mouths at a time in school, studying half-worn textbooks by the dim light of the old log lire after the day's work was done; catching a point hero and there and gathering inspiration from his very obscurity ; at first a simple teacher in the old Held school, then a wanderer with out friends or money and only a smattering of grammar and arithme tic with which to keep soul and body together ; another decade and he is at the head of au academy, then the president of a college, and now, ripe with experience and honor, he i6 contributing the wisdom of his life to the cause of education. Only thir teen months did he receive instruc tion, over fifty years has he beeu au instructor. One college and two uni versities have conferred honorary de grees upon him who never entered a college until called on to preside over one. Such a man, we say, knows experimentally tho educational status of Kentucky. He has watched our development along this line with the keen eye of a practical observer for over fifty years. He knows what ed ucation is as few men know. He is not burdened with the chimerical schemes of theoretical educators. lie sees what the masses need and his experience furnishes the wisdom to supply promptly tho demand. He is to education in Kentucky what Dan iel Boone was to pioneer life, ami Pe tor Cartwright to early Christianty Ho is the man to take hold of and manage our common schools. He can do right at tho work and will do it in a quick, common sense way The reform we need is less red tape and more plain, common sense work, Prof. Rust has received tho most complimentary solicitations to make tho race. From all parts of the state his friends most earnestly have ap pealed to him to enter the contest, hut, so far as we know, he has never intimated his intention or desire, Tliis is one of the cass in which the "office should seek the man," and if we read the signs aright there is a regular ground-swell for Prof. Rust. Should he intimate, his intention of running, it is doubtful if bis nomina tion could be headed off. lie is pre imiuently a man for the people, such a man as could take hold of popular education in Kentucky and push it to the highest possible standard in the shortest possible time.

Notwithstanding tho closeness ol the tinics,our list continues to increase and wo mean for it to continue to do so, if plenty of news and cheap prices will assist us. Our price is still $2- less than two cents a copy, postage included. We copy in this impression an ar ticle from the Henderson Gleaner, en dorsing our townsmen, Prof. J. W. Bust, for Superintendent of Public Instruction. Prof. Bust is being urged by his friends In various ice. tioni of the state to become a candi date for this very important office, and it is not improbable that lie will yield to the pressure being brought to bear and allow the use of bis name. He is not a politician and will not re tort to the methods of professional office-seekers to further his claims, but if the peoplo of Keutucky want him to be Superintendent of Public In struction we feel confident that be would accept the trust. Tho Second Congressional District has no an nounced candidates for state offices, though her 3,000 or 4,000 Democratic majority can always be relied upon to help swell the party vote. Her Dem ocrats are modest iu their demands, true as steel In their party affiliations, aud earnest lu their advocacy of par ty principles. Christian, the so-called "Republican county," has not only held her own in this year of general apathy, but increased lier Cleveland vote 700 in August and nearly 400 in November. Christian has never had one of her sons elected to a state of fice, and if sho brings Prof. Rust out and the Second District rallies to his support as it will do the slate con vention would bo expected to give him the nomination. Our 15,000 Dem ocratic votes are entitled to represen tation on the state ticket, and with the backing of his district Prof. Rust would bo a winning candidate. An exchange has suggested that Col. J. U. Powell, of Henderson, is the kind of man to make a first-class Governor. It seems that the young Democrats of the State, who are call ed "kids" by the old fogies, are do tormined to have a candidate of their own for Governor. There is a flue opportunity for some live, progressive and level-headed young man like J II. Powell, W. C. Owens or W. F. Browder to step into the gubernation- al contest and rattle up the dry bones. The newspapers of the state are clam oring almost with oue voice for a practical business man for Governor and if such a man can be found amongst the young Democracy and put in tiro Hold, Gen.
