The ordinary expenditures of tho Government for the flfical year ending June 30, 1880, amounted to a littio moro than $287,000,000. Of this sum $03,500,000 wero paid out for pensions. O. P. Huntinoton will gain control of the Louisvillo. New Albany and Chicago Railroad within ninoty days, if a report from New Yor is true. This great railway king is gradually enlarging his vast system of roads. It seems the Snow King lias been having a big time down South in the past few days. Throughout Tennessee tho fall is the heaviest ever known averaging from two to four feet in depth. At other places tho fall was unprecedented. The Montgomeroy Circuit Court is in sesion at Mt. Sterling with an unusually large docket tho largest, in fact, sinco the war. It consists of 127 criminal, 258 equity and 133 ordinary cases. Tho lawyers of that section ought to bo happy. Thk United 8tutes Circuit Court is in Beasion at Covington, with Judgo Barr presiding, Between one and two hundred moonshiners from the mountain countios are in attendance. Sixty indictments wero reported by the grand jury yesterday. i - - Kou the year ending June 30, 1880, tho revenue of the Government amounted to $12,700,000 more than tho previous year, while tho expenditures wero $17,700,000 less than 1885. Under Democratic rule, the government is being economically administered. A saving in one year of nearly J18.000.000 is something tho Republicans would hardly have eUccted. At a teceiit suasion of the Circuit Court iu Laurel County about two hundred indictments wero reported by the grand jury. Of tho number, were for soiling votes at the lato election. Claims amounting to about $4,000 wore allowed against tho State, and the sum would have been larger had the Judge anil Attorney failed to exercise the closest precaution. Labor has beon more abundantly durini; tho past four months than over in the history of the country. Tho percentage of idle to employed labor is lower at this time than since the boom of 1832. The cost of living is estimated at 20 per rent, less than then, and the purchasing power of monoy is put at 20 per ct?nt. greater by Bomo authorities. These conditions account largely for the unprecedented activity in house and shop building. Philadelphia Star. A boy was found on the street in Cincinnati tho other day too drunk to tell his namo. A short time previous to this tho Work-house Directorn released a who was nerving a sentence for selling liquor to miners. 'Comment is hardly necessary. The best way to compel obedience of the law is to enforce it to the letter. We have tho law. What is needed is a certainty of tho execution. Skykkm. parties have been indicted at London, Laurel County, this State, for Belling their votes at tho last -election, which brings ifoith the following pointed remarks from the Leader: Thoro entirely too much of this tinffip In votes Iu till county. Tho floating element bold the balance ut power, aud auy mnn, regardless ot his qnallilcitioiiK to hold oTlcc, can boetcoted If he will put up sufficient cash. It would he better for all concerned If theso peoplo wore disfranchised. A man who will uM his prerogative as a cltlr.en Is not worthy or QlllKsnNhlp, and wo hope these canon will hf vigorously prosecuted. The truth of tho above remarks Ih by all, and tho day is not far when such "citizens" will meet with a punMiment tlint will lit tho case. OplnionB of the Pfessl Tho Louisvillo Commercial Bays: " Tho message is dovoid of rhetorical flourish. It is carefully written, and is not lacking in interest for tho general reader." Speaking of tho President's message, tho Cincinnati Enquirer says: Altogether it Is a paper which will not simply challongo attontion, hut command it. At tho same time we aro impelled to tho suggestion that nono of tho measures Biiggested therein will meet tho approval of tho present Congress." Tho President's messago is a torse, strong, manly document, and will mako a good model for all future Democratic Presidents. Seldom have public measures boon bo capably handled or boon brought into so complete a harmony with the ascertained needs of the peoplo of tho whole country. Louisville Post. The Standard, of London, Eng., says : " President Cleveland's message is a Ben- siblo and statesmanlike production and eminently pacific. A note of menaco is not heard. Although in describing tho fisheries quontion ho throws unduo blamo upon tho Canadian fisheries, yot not a word is spoken to oxcito hostility or kindloetrifo." The message is, on tho whole, an excellent, documont, giving ample ovidonco of conscientious and painstaking work, and furnishing abundant testimony, if it wero needed, to tho patriotism and public spirit of its author. Mr. Tildon, doscribing Mr. Cleveland, onco said of him, " he is a man who would rather write a bad paper for himself than havo a frlond write him a good ono." Tho present paper is not a bad, but a good ono, and it is obviously tho product of the President's own genius. It marks progress and betrayB improvement in many ways; notably in an oasly familiarity with prevailing ideas and less of a certain crudo pragmatism which hns sometimes shown itself in Mr. Cleveland's writing. Its tono is that of an honest man, and, whether wo agrco with all Us conclusions or not, wo aro bound to respect its intelligence and candor. Louisvillo Courier-Journal. Major M. O. Johnson, ono of tho most prominent attorneys of Lexington, died last night. He was eighty years of age. We have heard of two instances thia week that illustrate tho good results being brought about by the new Revonuo law. Ono citizen who has heretofore been assessed at about $20,000 or $25,000 voluntarily gave In his property for taxation at $50,000. Another who was assessed last year at a little over 52,000, reported $8,000 this year for taxation. And yet there are some people who want this law repealed. Mkkifke County has about an even dozen candidates iu tho field for the Legislature, and the mountaineers arc promised an exciting contest. Tho main quostion at issue is the election of a Unitod States Senator to succeed Senator Beck. Some of the candidates lutve linked their political fate with that of the wily and distinguished ex-Scotchman, while others favor Kentucky's honored son, Speaker Carlisle. - Timely Warning. Huntington's SouUiBide railroad, from the Big Sandy to the Licking, is being bnilt by convicts, and more convicts are being planted along the line of tho Louisville Southern to do tho work on that line. This is bud enough, but it ia not bo bad as using this felon labor to break up established mining communities. When the branch prison is completed, if tho Democratic party doesn't put a stop to ttw working of convicts all over the State and confine this striped labor within walls, there will be no Democratic party led in Kentucky. Louisvillo Times. CommunlcHted. Pithy Points From Washington. What excuse can men offer for being engaged in tho disreputable business of making drunkards of their neighbors, other than that there is money in the trade? What do whisky sellers give a man in exchange for his hard-earned money, other than red eves, a shining nose, breath, bud credit, a diseused mind, a freo pass to the penitentiary or gallows, and lastly, loss of body and Bonl? A man must certainly be void of conscience who can, day in and day out, serve to his neighbors ond ottnrs that which foments airifo and discord, incites to crime and murder, ond winch will cause a man to do what nothing else will strike down his mother or father. How can any man who has sons look with complaisance upon a business which is lying in wait to entrap them, and onco it has woven its deadly coils about them, forever claims them as itH nwn offspring of vice and iufamy V " How can any man who cares anything for the fnturo of his soiih view with other than distrust and suspicion, a business which is almost certain to be the downfall and ruin of some of them ? Howls it possible font man who looks to his sons for his honor and support, to entertain for tho whisky trade in any of its branches anything but loathing, and for the men ongaged in it the eamo consideration that ho would for a murderer? Tho drunkard 1b incomparably the superior in everything that goes to make a mnn to tho ono that sells tho liquor, whether It bte by tho barrel, jug or glasa. Tho man who deals in tho article which makes drunkards, no matter whothor in large or small quantities, is tho sworn enemy to innocence, to virtue, to manhood and to all olso which makes life worth living. , There Is no man of ordinary Intelligence but knows that tho whisky business, besides being a fou to all that is of any value in life ia tho sworn ally of crime and murders; of anarchy and rioters; of jails penitentiaries. That tho men who aro engaged In tho busiueBB of making drunkards should bo viewed lu their light, as tho diro enemies of tho household and State, and to bo shunned as they would a pestilenco. An End to Bono Scraping. Edward Shephard, of Harrisburg, III., says: " Having received bo much benefit from Electric Bitters, I feel it my duty to lot Buffering humanity know it.
