The executive committee of the gen eral campaign committee met today at 1 p.m. One o fthe important things to be taken up, according to Rev. Dr. James E. Walker, Mr. Sunday's "ad- i vance man," is the question of an ade quate and suitable house for the Sun day party, which will number fourteen. Owtng to the crowded conditions here this is a phase of difficulty never be fore encountered in the campaigns in other places. As a final resort, Dr. Walker says the party may have to be divided In order to obtain the necessary accommodations. The party will arrive at 4:45 p.m. January 5, the day before the campaign opens. Billy is now at Winona Lake, Ind., recuperating from the Atlanta campaign. Tonight there will be a meeting of th? personal workers, representing each co-operating church, in the First Congregational Church, at which the church members to help in campaign work will be listed. Rev. Lucius Clark, chairman, will preside. Tomor row night at the tabernacle, which will be completed during the present week, the "key men" in charge of the differ ent detachments of ushers will meet for instruction, with Dr. Walker, H. S. Omohundro, chairman and chief usher, and the heads in charge of each "divi sion** of ushejs. The necessary 446 ushers and doorkeepers themselves will not be at this meeting, but will have their first big drill and instruction night December 27. Enough. Sopranos, Lack Contraltos. All needed sopranos for the three big choirs have been secured, but there is still need for contraltos, basses and tenors, according to P. S. Church, mu sical director of Petworth M. E.

These show that last Tuesday 376 hemes were opened for meetings, and last Friday 306. German Mutinies. fm the Montreal Star. lfore trouble In the enemy naval fwees ia reported. It Is a curious thing that discontent In a military nation usually appears first in the navy. The Boaaian navy is the latest example of tbla. the mutinies on the Black sea warships being the first serious fore runners of successful revolutionary flttvemants. Why this should be true ia sot clear. But possibly it Is due to the fact that a warship is a separate unit: and that, once a crew Is organ ised for trouble. It can pretty well pur sue its own course. From the outside It would seem as If a post on the Kiel fleet would be about as tempting a po sition aa exists today in the armed forces of Germany.

AMENDMENT PROPOSED TO EXCESS PROFITS LAW Difficulties Arise From Borrowed Money, Good "Will, Patents and Copyrights. Amendment of the excess profits law to broaden the definition of "invested capital" by including: certain earning assets will be recommended this week by the excess profits advisory commit tee, and the recommendation probably will be transmitted to Congress by Secretary McAdoo. Members of the committee, after sev eral weeks' study of the law, have I come to the conclusion that it is quite : impossible to remedy apparent injus tices which would develop under the measure by executive rulings. At the top of the list of difficult situ ations to be met stand the questions of allowance for borrowed money invest ed in a business, for value of good will, patents and copyrights and other in tangible assets, and for depreciation. Many companies with small capital, doing business largely on borrowed money, have complained that under the excess profits provision their earnings would be taxed almost at a confiscatory rate, while other concerns with equal | assets and earnings, but without bor_ rowed money, would take a lower rate of tax. Failure of the law to provide for set ting a capital figure on good will has led to many complaints, particularly from newspapers and other publications with plant and equipment of relatively small value, but large earnings based principally on good will. Despite the tangle and injustices ?which might develop from the law as it stands, the excess profits advisers be lieve it is workable in the main, and will propose regulations to make it so. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS COMMENDED IN ITALY Mr. Wilson's Words Offset Gloom Created by the Situation in Russia. BY TAXCRED ZAXGHKRI. Cablegram to The Evening: Star and Chicago Dally New?. Copyright, 1017. MILAN, Italy, December 17.?Many of the newspapers are still devoting much space to President Wilson's re cent message to Congress, which they say effaces the gloomy impression cre ated by the Russian situation. They point out that the economic, moral and military power of America much more than compensates for the loss of Rus sia. II Secolo of this city says the President talks rather with the sober deliberation of a judge than in the language of a combatant. "Mr. Wilson," it says "is truly a judge who is never blind and who proclaims the justice of the allies, cause while rejecting imperialism even on the part of the victors.'' With regard to Austria it is pointed out here that the populations of the dual empire have shown in innumer able ways that they aspire to seces sion and not to federation, while the government in Vienna is determined to smother completely the will of the people. 11 Secolo concludes that this American sympathy for Austria should make Italians appreciate the fact that Mr. Wilson took a most opportune mo ment to act. The Corriere della Sera says: "It does not matter much if Mr. "Wil son appears not. to comprehend the enormous responsibility of Austria, which by military force has denied every national right, for the Presi dent's main idea is that it is essentia^ to vanquish Germany?a point on* which he is effectively exact." It is rather remarkable that Italian opinion is not yet well acquainted wi$h Mr. Wilson's views concerning a league of nations after the war. The people here will doubtless receive the plan with enthusiasm when it is thoroughly explained to them. Flower Tones. From the Los Angeles Times. We hear more and more about the form and color of musical sounds and tone combinations. First thing you know we will all be seeing music in stead of hearing it, and the critics will be writing about Winkemflunk's sym phony in blue and Flingemosky's pur ple sonatas. Great pianists will hurl mountains of floral beauty at their au diences, and the master violinist will waft sweet lilies and lilacs of sound across the footlights. Birds will cease to warble and will start to painting. The skylark's note will become a cord of gold connecting earth and heaven, and the poet will refer to the mocking bird's medley as an exquisite rainbow of song. See Who's Here. From Judgo.
