Although tho change was In actual operation during three quarters only of tho last fiscal year, Its cflect was felt upon tbo lov enuo for tbo entire j ear; tho sales of stamps for tho quarter ended Sept. 80, 1683, having been greatly curtailed in view or tho ap proaching reduction In tho rate. Thus, tbo tales for that quarter under the 3 cent rnto amounted to 310,0s.l,50'5), while tho ncrago tor the three succeeding quarters was SUVJO,. 781.88. In rcfcrcnco to tho reduction of postago Cen. Hatton saj s that it Is cv Ideut tho predic tion has been fully perilled that tho reduced rate would greatly stlmulato lettor corre spondence, and lead to tho substitution of eealod lnclosures forpostal cards and open cir culars In regard to tho tree delivery service tho fol low lng important recommendations aro made: Tho ircc-dellvery scrvlco has now readied that period in its history when It is largely sell sustaining, tho surplus over the entire cost oftho scrvlco bavlmr gradually increased for tho past ten) cars until, during the last fiscal j ear, it amounted to 81,27.!,27tJ 25. I teel, there lore, tlmt lean with gieat propriety urge tho reduction of postago on local letters to I cent, tho single rate. Tho reasons for such reduc tion seem to me stronger than those presented for tho reduction of postage on mall letters to 2conts Letters which nro strict! local lu character Imolvo but comparatively little ex pense to tho department In their handling, and, therefore, tho Impression v cry generally prevails In cities wheru tho lreo deliver scr v lee Is In operation that tho prt scut local rate of postage (2 cents) is exccssivo;at least, that it Is Immoderate In comparison with the trans mission by mall and delivery b carrier of a letter irom New Y'ork to bail 1 aauefsco for tbo samo amount of postage. bo far as known, tho reduction of tbo rato on mall letters has met with great favor, nnd tho public undoubtedly believes that It should bo the aim of a prosperous government to re duce tho ratesot postago on tnallmatter when ever practicable. Considering, therefore, tho very largo revenue dcrlvod irom tho letter carrier service during tho past j car, tho time seems propitious lora reduction of the postago on local letters to one-half their present rate. I am confident that such u cbango would re sult iu ii very considerable) Increase in tho number of local letters mailed, and that tho free-delivery rev cnuo would not bo so greatly impaired thereby as to I rev cut it from i gula reaching tbo present amount lu a few years. Die necessity and demand, lu cities, for prompt transmission and delivery ot lutein passing between business men and others has resulted In tbo establishment, in many places, of what may bo termed letter express compa nies, which, by tho employment of rupssenger boys, aro enabled greatly to laellltate Intel course of tbls character among merchants, professional persons, and others engaged In active life. It is done at asmnll cxpciisonnd with so much svHtiu and promptness as se riously to cllmtnl-li tho revenues of tho depart ment at fev oral letter ( an ier olUccs Tho patronago which in extended to thoso companies nllords ev idenco that the freo de livery system, liotwlthstiiiillug its facilities nnd bonells, has not progressed so far as to meet all the wants of energetic business llfo In largo commercial cities llicroloro lurther improvemeutof tbu service In this particular should, in my Judgment, bo attempted, not only to prevent u loss of rov enuo, but with a purpose to mako It as useful ns pofslblo. 1 am of opinion that tho public hav on right to ex pect that tbls department should make tbo fcumo onori lu burvu lucm iioiiiini) mm man fully in thutransmlsslouniid delivery of lcttors as is done by private parties. 1 know of no nay in which tbls can bo better accomplished than by the uso of u special postago stamp tor letters malic d and intended lor special and prompt dcllvo-y at free dellv cry oillces. This stamp sbouldboof tho denomination of 10 cents, and, when mllxcd to a letter lu addition to tho proper postago charge, should Insure for it as speedy n delivery as posslblo niter Its rereptlon at any letter carrier o'.llce.

If, at tbo expiration or this probatloiuirj period, tboy havo proven themselves competent, they aro given a full appointment at class one Aller uu upHilut luent iu class ouo all clerks are promoted, ac cording to merit, w ben vacant les occur.

Tho amouut of special study that these clerks havo devoted to the duties of tbelr office would havo made them proficient in almost any of tho professions of Hie. in iho very nature of tho case, tho places of IIhim killed clei H who baio made their rrork ft llli) study, wunot bo lllicd with now appointees without great detriment totho service. Tho Injustice to tho men themselves might bo left out out of tho nucstlon. but tho system by which they havo fitted thonloivcs for their posts, nnd tbo maintenance! of a good service, demand that this branch of tho postal scrvlco be continued In tho lino of ,11s present successful dev elopmont, As oxpotlonccd clerks nro absolutely Indis pensable to an efficient service, It could not do other than work contusion and delay totho wholo mall Rvstein of tho country If tho prese nt fort c should be tct aside ind new and In experienced men be put In their places About eni per eeui.oinii cicrxs nppoiuieu laniuims satisfactory examinations and are retired lis wilt thus bo seen that a far greater number of clerks lmvo been nppolnttd than nro now in tho service, but by this silling process tho department has secured tho most actho nnd clltclcnt clerks. And I venture to say that no moro worthy, competent, and eilklent corps of men can bo found iu any brunch of tho government scrvlco. During tho past twelve years not aslnglo clerk has been removed without good cause, and that causo has been Incompetency, In temperance, or neglect of duty lly such means tho clerks havo, In great measure, felt secure in tlielr tenure, nna nave ciovotcei themselves with all cncrgv totho bestlntcn sts oi tho service. And, as tho retention or tho present forco of postal clerks Is essential to tho Integrity of tha mall service If the teiiura of this oliws of employes cannot bo mado securo under tho civil scrvlco law now on tho statute books I would recommend thnt congress enact a law whereby railway postal clerks shall ho sccuro In their positions, and be liable to removal only for ono of the following causes, vlr, Incapacity for tbo duties of tho olllco, disobedience ol official Instructions, in attention to or neglect of duty, intemperance, orcoudtict unbecoming a gentleman Through such permanency the present method would bo complete, and with this safeguard thrown around them tho tiostal clerks would fjol that ., I.I l. .. .... -l .I.....I.I r ...IT. nn. cue) CJUUlUKISU up nil eimuKiie oi miiiii viu- plo)mcnt and dovoto allot tlielr active lite to tho perfection of this branch or tho public service, which now presents a goodlllustia- Honor practical civil service, and needs only permanency to perfect It. l'or)cars promotions havo been mado on merit alone. All tho officers havo worked their way up from tho lowest grado to their K resent positions, so that each and ever) man olds his situation by reason of htscompctency and thorough know led ol the sen Ice. I havo dwelt in detail upon thlsfeituro of tho needs of tho railway mall scrvlco because I deem it Important, 1 ho present general super lntendeutof tho railway mall serv leo lias fre quently urged that this mi asuro of permanency In npiiolnlmcnt Is necessary to tho perfection or tho mall service, and one or mj predeces sors transmitted a bill to congress with his approval cinbod)lngthumalu features hero set forth. Tho report says that the fast mall scrvlco on tho trunk lines has been very materially lm C roved, and that tho changes In tho west liayo ecn such as to benefit all tho western states and territories, nearly a business day being gained In tho delivery of malls at Ban Iran cjsco nnd a full day being gained at Portland, U-egon, nnu lmcrmeuiaie iioinis. The appropriation for special facilities on trunk lines for the present vcar is SiW.O'W. This amount, In my opinion, Is being econom ically aud Judiciously expended, and great benefit accrues to tho public by tho expendi ture. 1 therefore recommend n continuation of tho appropriation for tho coming year, with tho increase recommended by tho second as sistant istmastcr general, making a total of SJiiO,754 50. lu my oplulou the fast mall sys tem should bo continued and extended at rapid!) as circumstances will permit In n gard to tho postal money order system den nation sa)s: At tho close ol tho last fiscal rear thoro woro 0,310 mont) order offices, an incroaso of 33-1 over tho previous car.

After deducting nil ascertainable expenses of every kind there was a net profit ol 8241,850 HI. Of Iho total number of transactions the money orders comprised OS per cent, and tho postal notes 32 per cent. Tho revenue de riv cd from postal notes up to tbo closo of tho fiscal year amounted to ! kt.s'j t si. I cannot loo strongly urge upon congress tho necessity oi so amending the law as to permit tbo depositing of ull fees received Irom tho Is sue ol lilonc) orders nnd postal notes In tho trewiirv with other postal receipts. Under n construction of the present law a clerk lu a postofilco paid from the regular allowance for clerk-blroinadob) tho first assistant postmas ter general Is not permitted to do any part of tho mbor n quire d In making out and pnj ing money orders. This Is absurd, Postmasters at first, second, and third class olliccs should not bo allowed any portion of tho monc) or der and postal note ices T heso lees bhould go cullro into tuo receipts oi mo various omcus, and sulllelcnt allowance should bo mado for clerical assistance without rcfcrcnco to tho class or wort performed.

There nro shown, ho said, In the toxt, two stages lu tho llfo of tho church ono of preparation, Iho other of perfection. Just as tho love of a hus band lor hlswlfo should bo unbroken and pt rtual, so also Is Christ's lov o f ir his church. Tho word holy has various significations, and Is applied lo things us well ns to persons, to chalices and other sacred osols, ami to doctrines nnd sacraments. Sanctity is an attribute of tbo church It Is not meant to Imply by this that all its members nro hoi), nor Is It necessary that In tho church tho saints should outnumber llio sinners; It Is sulllelcnt that alio Is oblo to produdo saints. Tho misdeeds of sinners nro the Ir own, tho church has no part lu them, and they havo no forco as objections to her sanctity. Tniauctlfy thu church Christ apisdnted a ministry, mado it perpetual and gave It n vitality, with all Iho world for Its field, aud nil time fur Its laliors.

THE rOl.TT.FMlllTH lOMIItkSS TO HEAS SKMUIiK AUtll lli.tl.SS. Work Laid Oat For Senate and Honsc I Possibility or Adjournment Oat or Itcsiiut to Deresvul Members A Proposed Msll; to err Orleans. The advent of congress, even a short session, always sets Washington In ft flutter, nnd tho usual Sunday quiet was yesterday disturbed by n sort ofiuhduod excitement , Hvcry trnlu on Saturday nnd jcslorday was loaded with congressmen and others Interested In legisla tion. Tbo hotels wcro crowded last night, though many occupying quarters thcro will probably soon scolc quieter accommodations In prlvato families. Doth houses will bo called to order for tho second session of tho forty-eighth congress nt noon to-day. Ono member of tho sennto nnd two members of tho nouso havo died during tho recess, aud two members of tho houso have resigned, It is probablo that tho first proceedings In both branchi swill bo tho swearing In of tho now members to fill tho v acanclcs thus created, If this accompanied by tho customnry formal announcements or deaths the two houses will propnbly adjourn nt ouco as a mark of respect to tho memory of tho doceased. Tho pre cedents In such cases bow over give reason for tho belief that no formal announcements of deaths w llltako placo to-day, or If they do take plac o will follow tho reading of the President's message. Inthlscaso there will probably bo no unusual delay lu tho appointment oftho joint commltteo lo notify tho President or thu rcadlncs of tho two houses to recolvo his an nual message. A greater number of appropriation bills nro In readlnoss for tbo consideration of subcom mittees oftho house commltteo on appropria tions thnn havo been prepared nt so curly a date for ft number ot jcars Theso bills In clude tho estimates for tho Indian, army, navy, military, academy, consular, and diplo matic, postofilco, and District or Columbia ap propriations. Members or tho appropriations ( ommltteo ale ol opinion that ono or two or these bills will bo ready to report to tho houso during this week. It has been suggested by n number of rcpro seutntlvcs that congress tako n recess about tho middle ot tho mouth, to glvo an oppor tunity for membars to ntlcud tho opening of tho New Orleans Hxposltlou, nnd that during this proposed reciss the appropriations com mltteo consider appropriation bills, so ns to havo most of them reidy to report to tho houso upon tho reassembling of congress after the hollelavs. They argue that tbo usual amount of work prior lo adjournment for the boll da)s will havo been accomplished by the 11th instant, ticcauso oi mu usually cariy assem blage of congress this )ear. Tho Mcl'herson (sennto) bill, to prov ldo for tho Issue of circulating notes to national batiks, and tho (Dlngloy) bill, to authorize the sccrclnrv of the treasury to invest the lawful money deposited lu tho treasury Intrust by national banks for tho retirement ol their circulating notes, were both reported favorably from tho committee! ou banking and currency nt tho last session, and nuwawalt thu action of the house. All eliort w Hi bo mado by tho house commlt teo ou public hinds to secure curly considera tion or tho bill providing for tho lorfelluro of tho Northern i'aclllo laud grant That meas ure was fivorably repotted to tho houso nt tho last session of congress. A bankruptcy bill, as a substitute for tho sennto bill ou tho snmo subject, was favorably reported by tbo Judl- ciarv coinmiiiee. .ucniuerf oi mis committee say It is their oplulou that no action will bo taken upon tbo bill during tbo present con gress. Tho Mexican pension bill, which was dc b ited at length during tho last lew days or tho last session, is tho first "unfinished business" to bo considered, aud this cau bo reached only by a motion to dlscus-s measures on tbu speaker's tabic. Itopresentatlvo Townsh'iid, who bod ebargo of that measure, says ho w III ask for Its further consideration at tho earliest practicable moment. Tho president of the senate and tho ser geant at-aruis nude o tour of Inspection of iho senato wing or the cnpltol baturdav, examin ing tho several Improvements Introduced into commltteo iintl cloak rooms, aud Iho condi tion ofthe rooms themselves, and found every thing in readiness lor tho opening of tho ses sion. Opinions regarding tho course of business during tho session were expressed with tho qualification In most Instances that they em bodied only tbo views of tho speakers as to what might and what ought to bo dono. It Is probable that no serious eoutentloiis between tbo two bouses will tako placo over tho appro, prlatlon bills, with the posslblo exception of bu naval bill nrovldtm? tor tho Inst six months or the present fiscal vcar. Tho settlements or controverted matters last session m connec tion with tbo o'her arinronrlatlon bills will probably lu maiiv cascabo taken ns precedents lor tbo action or the committees nnd or tho two bouses al this session. The Interstate couimcrco bill, reported to tho senato Inst j ear, is set for consideration noxt lhursdii), and the postal telegraph bill the Monday lollowlng The bills lor thu admission of Dakota nnd Washington territories will undoubtedly bo pressed bv tbo semitors who hnvu them in charge Tho electoral count bill Is riallv in the hands of tho senate, tho house having passed u substitute for the senato bill, mid tbo conlircneo commltteo having failed to ngreo upon thu measure, and thu opinion prevails among senators Unit tbo coining session will bo a favorable tlmo to bring this Important sublet l to tho point of final nctlon llut tho position or tbo senato having be en taken iitiaii Imoiish there is 11 tt lo or no prospect that It will recede and accept tho houso substitute. It Is therefore believed that unless tbo houso re eih s from Its position and Instructs lis con leicni e accordingly no action will bo possible, the bill lorthoiiiolnago of tho trndo dollar Is before tho sennto committee on finance, and its consideration was last session .o.-tponeil until Diee.iiberoi Ibis session.
