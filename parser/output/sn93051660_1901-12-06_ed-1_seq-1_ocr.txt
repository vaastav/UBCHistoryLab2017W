WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. President Roosevelt's message to Congress follows: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: . . The Congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity. On the om ui cepuemutr rrciuKiii hot by an anarchls:, while attending tne 4; i !.-., ., nff.ir, r,,i Pan-American Exposition, at Buffalo, and died in that city on the 14th of that month. Grief of the People. ' The shock, the grief of the country are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days while the President yet hov ered between ile and death When we turn from the man to the Na tion, .the harm done i3 so great as to ex cite our gravest ar-prehensions end to de mand our wisest and most resolute action. This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reck less utterance-s of those who, on the slump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred The Anarchist Is a Malefactor. The Federal Courts should . be given Jurisdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the President or any man . who, by the Constitution or by law, is in line of succession for the Presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity o" the offense against our insti tutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole human race; and all mankinl should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form' of man-stealing known as the slave trad-2; for it is of far blacker infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the Federal Gov ernment the power of dealing with the 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. Restoration of - Confidence and Re turn of Prosperity. During the last five years business con fidence has been restored, ana tne na tion is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity. Such pros perity can never be created by law alone, although it is, easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. Fundamentally, the welfare of each citizen, and. therefore. the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the Nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this Individual capacity;but wise legislation and honest ana intelligent aa ministration can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. Caution in Dealing With Trust An additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be found in the International commercial conditions of today. The same business conditions which have produced the great aggrega tlons of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors In International commercial competition. Business concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the .ablest men are naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial supremacy among the na tions of the world. America has only just begun to assume that commanding position In the international business world which we believe will more and more be hers. It Is of the utmost impor . tance that ' this position be not jeopar dized especially at a time when the over flowing abundance of our own natural re sources and the skill, business energy and - mechanical aptitude of our people matee foreign markets essential. Under 6uch conditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our nation. MUchlevons Lenrialatlon. In dealing with business interests for the Government to undertake, by crude and Ul-consMered legislation, to do what may turn out to be bad, would br to Incur the risk of such far-reaching national disaster that it would be pref erable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the al.ies of th' forces with which they are nominally a war, for they . hamper those who would endeavor to find- out in rational fashior what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it Is practi cable to supply remedies. All -this is true;, and yet ft is also triK that there are real and grave evils, om of the chief being over-capitalization be cause of Its many baleful consequences and a resolute and practical effort mu be made to correct these evils. Reg-ulatlon .of Corporation. - There Is a widespread conviction In the minds of the American people that tht great corporations, known as trusts an in certain of their features arid tendon cies hurtful-to the general welfare.' Th!.1 springs from no spirit of envy or un charitableness, nor lack' of pride in tht great industrial achievements that . have placed this country at the head of the nations struggling ror commercial su premacy. ' It Is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concen tration should be, not prohibited, but su pervised, and, within, reasonable limits, controlled; and in my judgment this con vlctlon Is right. Great corporations exist only be cause -they are created and safeguarded by our Institutions, and it Is, therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions. 'necessity of Publicity. The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combina tions is knowledge of facts publicity. Artificial bodies, such as corporation: and joint stock or other associations, de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate Information as to their operations should be made public regular ly at reasonaoie intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized In one state, al ways do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where . they are incorporated. There is litter lack of uniformity in the state law: about them; and as no state has any ex clusive interest in. or power -over their acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through state action.; Therefore, in the' interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without interfering with the power of the states In the matter Itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over alt corpo rations doing an interstate business. Department of Commerce and Indus, tries. There should be created a Cabinet of fleer, to be known as Secretary of Com merce and Industries, as provided in the pill introduced at the last session Of the Congress. It should be him province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense; including among many other things what! ever concerns labor and all matters affect ing the great business corporations ana our merchant marine. With the sole exception of the farming interest ho one matter is of such vital moment to our whole people as the wel fare of the wage-worker. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off too. It is. therefore, a matter -for hearty congratulation that, on the whole, wages are higher today In the 

TTI,A4 Ql.tu Uafnra In Mir .(-unlet. .aico Lilian . . ... nlstory and far higher than in any other country. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Every effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and Its improvement wherever possible. Chinese Exclusion. Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should alao be pro tected, so far as it is possible, from the presence In this country of any laborers brought over by contract, 'or of those who. coming freely, yet represent a standard living so depressed that they can un "--;,,,, , tha iah- morUo- nrt """"' , ", V drag them to a lower level. I regard It as necessary with this end In view, to re. enact immediately the law excluding Chi nese laborers, and to strengthen it wher ever necessary In order to make its en forcement entirely effective. Trades Unions. The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole civilized world, has to deal, is the prob lem which has for one side the better ment of social conditions, moral and phy sical, in large cities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far rfcaciung Question winch we group togetn er when we sneak of "labor." The chief factor in the success of each man-wage- oiiier, farmer and capitalist alike must ver be the sum total of his own in dividual dualities and abilities. Second only to this comes the power of act ual tn combination or association witn others. Very great good has been and 'ill be accomplished by associations or nlons of wage-workers, when managed with forethought and when they corn- Ins insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for the rights of oth ers. , . . ' V - Better Immigration Laws Needed. Our present immigration laws -are un satisfactory. We need every honest and. fhcient immigrant- fitted to become an American citizen, every Immigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout heaTt. a good head, and a resolute purpose to do his duty well n every way. ard tb brine ut his chil dren as law-abiding and God-fearing .lumbers of the community, Hut there 3hould be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a three-fold mprovement over our present system. trst. we should aim to exclude absolute- r not only all persons who are known to be believers In anarchistic principles or members Of anarchistic societies, but also all persons who are of a low moral ten dency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should require a more thor ough system of inspection abroad and more rigid system of examination at .our immigration ports, the former being es pecially necessary. The second object of a proper immlgra tion law ought to be to secure, by a care- ul and not merely perfunctory educa tional test, some intelligent capacity to ppreciate American lnsu tlllions ana act sanely as American citizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many oi them belong to the intelligent crimlna Hut it would do what ,1s also in point, that is, lend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so potent in producing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion ana atred of order, out of which anarchistic sentiment Inevitably springs. Finally, all persons should be excluded who are below x certain standard of economic fitness to nter our ' industrial field as competitor "th American labor Both the educational and economic tests m a wise immigration law should be de signed to protect and elevate the general body, polilic and social. A very close su pervision should be exercised over the steamship coi' panies, which mainly bring over the immigrants, and they should be ne.a to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law." Tariff Revision Hurtfnl. There is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a National oollev. The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this economic poucy.- XNOtmng couia De more unwise than to disturb the' business Interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time Reciprocity must be treated as the hand maiden of protection. Our first duty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff In every case where it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done with out injury to our home industries. i asK tne attention oi tne senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor. condition of the Merchant Marine. The condition of- the American mer hant marine 13 such as to call for lmme- iiate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us as a Nation that ,iur merchant marine should be utterly nsienlncant In comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a mnjne- iwruon oi our great commerce is ?arried In our own ships. Financial Masters. The .act of March 14, 1900, intended un equivocally, to establish gold as the stand ird money and to maintain at a parity therewith all form ot the money ..medium n use with us, has been shown to be imely and judicious. The price of our Government bonds In the world's mar ket, when compared with the price of nmuar oDiigatlors issued by other na- ions, is a flattering tribute to- our public credit: This- condition it is evidently de sirable to maintain. In many respects the National banking law furnishes sufficient liberty fop the iroper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence if commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to "the de mands of our domestic trade and com merce. Surplus in the Treasury. The collections from duties on imports ind internal taxes continue to exceed the 3rdinary expenditures of the Government, thanks mainly to the reduced Army ex penditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues: so that there will be any possibility of a deficit; but, after providing against any such con. tingency, means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly with in the limit of our actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secretary of the Treasury considers all tnese questions at length, and I ask your attention to the report and recommendations. I call especial attention to the need of strict economy In expenditures. The fact that our National needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever is actual ly necessary to our well-being should mak'j us doubly careful to husband our National resources as each of us husbands his private resources, by scrupulous avoid ance of anything like 'wasteful or reck less expenditure. , Interstate Commerce Law, In 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways, com monly known as the interstate commerce act. The cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable, - and that all shippers, local ities and commodities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was cre ated and endowed with what were sup posed to be the necessary powers to exe cute the provisions of this act. The act should be amended. The rail way la a public servant. Its rates should X

The Government should see to It . that within its jurisdiction - this is so, and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. Department of Ag-riculture. The Department of Agriculture, during the past IS years, has steadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has ac complished results of real value In up building domestic and foreign trade, it has gone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our country and with two of the island groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as a live lihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits and vegetables spe cially fitted for introduction Into localities of the several states and territories where they may add materially to our resources. Value of the Forests. Public ODinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a just appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural growth. The great part played by them in the creation ana maintenance or tne national wealth is now mora luuy realized than ever before. The nractlcal usefulness of the National forest reserves to the mining, grazing, ir rigation and other Interests of the regions in wmcn tne reserves lie nas tea to a wide spread demand by the people of the West for tneir protection ana extension. ine forest reserves will inevitably be of still ereater use In the future than in tne oast. Additions should be made to them when ever practicable, and their usefulness should be increased by a thoroughly bust ness-like management- Protection of Reserves. - At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the General Land Of fice, the mapping and description of their timber with the United States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with the general advancement of practical for estry in the United States. These vari ous functions should be united in the Bu reau of Forestry, to which they properly beloncr. . The wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful to the interests which depend on water than to those which ilenend on wood and grass. The water supply Itself depends upon the forest. In the arid region it is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country today if the waters that now run to waste were savea ana used for irrigation. The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital inter nal o.uestlons or trie united states. certain of tne forest reserves snouia aiso be made preserves for the wild forest creatures. All of the reserves should Oe better protected from fires. Forests Are Reservoirs.. The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood and re- pienisnmg mem in arougnt tney m&K possible the use of waters otherwise wast ed. They prevent the soil from washing. and so protect the storage reservoirs from hiung up witn slit. f orest conservation is,, therefore, an essential condition of water conservation. The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to 'save the flood waters. Their con struction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the maiviauai states acting alone, if ar reaching interstate problems are involved and the resources of single states would often be Inadequate. It is orooerly a Na tional function, at least in some of its features. The Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as It does other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season, to take the same course under tne same laws as the natural now. : Reclaiming Arid Lands. The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different problem. Here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The object of the Government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish .this object water must be brought within their reacn. The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, Just as the settlement of the Onio and Mississippi Valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic States. The Increased de mand for manufactured articles will stim ulate industrial production, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies and ef fectually prevent Western competition with Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of min ing and other industries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for suc cessful home-making is but another name for the upbuilding of the Nation. The necessary foundation has already been laid, for the' inauguration of the pol icy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too much, for a great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what can and what cannot be safely at tempted, by the early efforts, which must of necessity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginning the Gov ernment should make clear, beyond shad ow of doubt, its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public in terest. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal or lo cal interests, but only in accordance with the advice of trained, experts, after long investigation has shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the greatest usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no extrava gance, and the believers In the need of Irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys. Kxtenslon of Irrlsjatlon. Whatever the Nation does for the ex tension of irrigation should harmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now living on Irrigated land. We are not art the starting point of this devel opment,Over $200,000,000 of private cap ital has already been expended in the con- structlon of irrigation works, and many million acres of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and ability bas been shown in the work Itself: but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws relating thereto. The security and vafcie of the homes created depend large ly on the stability of titles to water: -but the majority of these rest on the uncer tain foundation of court decisions ren dered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid states have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams In times of scarc ity. Lax and uncertain laws have made It possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or necessities, and many streams have already passed into private ownership, or a control equivalent to ownership. Nation's Aid Justified. : The benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past Justify tne Nation s aid and co-operation In the more difficult and Important work yet to De -accomplished 

INSULAR MATTERS. "I What Must Be Done to Develop Hawaii. . In Hawaii our aim must . be to develop the territory on the traditional Ameri can lines. We do not wish a regioa of large estates tilled by cheap labor: we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end In view: the well-being of the average home-mak er must afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system. Porto Rico. J It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to fono Rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limits. The: isl and is thriving as never before, and it is being administered efficiently and honest ly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of the United States, and upon this fact we con gratulate them and ourselves. en on. In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent govern ment ot the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the Con gress closes this will be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress: and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of Na tional interest why . the ; policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask. your attention to the wisdom. Indeed to the vital need, offero vlding for a substantial reduction In the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United States. - The Philippines. In the Philippines our problem Is larg er. They are very rich tropical islands. Inhabited by many varying tribes, repre senting widely different stages of pro gress toward civilization. Our earnest effort Is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest beneflt.-to the Filipinos them selves: and as an earnest of what we In tend to 46, we point to "What we nave done. Already a greater measure of ma terial prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before in their history. Troubles Still Ahead. There are stiil troubles ahead in the islands. The Insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the Old world Encouragement, direct or indirect, to these insurrectos stands on tne same footing as encouragement tc "hostile Indians in. the days when we still had Indian wars. Ex actly as our aim Is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration, but to have it un derstood that we show no weakness if be goes on the warpatb, so we must make it evident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands or civinza tlon and humanity, that while we will do everything in our power for the Filipino who Is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto and the ladrone. Additional Len-lslatlon Needed. The time has come when there should bo additional legislation for the Philip pines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to Introduce industrial enter. prises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial dcvelooment. The connection between Idleness and mischief Is proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of. the surest preventives or war. Of course, no business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to his interest to do so; and it is Immensely to tne in terest of the islands that he should go in It Is. therefore, necessary that the Con gress should pass laws by which the re sources of the islands can be developed so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing business in them, and every encourage ment be given to the incoming of business men of every kind. Pacific Cable. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from tne Philippines to points in Asia, we snouia not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable. It is de- manded'not merely fat commercial, but for political and military considerations. Either the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of a Govern ment cable, or else ..an arrangement should be made by which like advantages those accruing from-, a Government cable may be secured to - the Government by contract with a private cable company. 

NICARAGUA CANAL. Work of the Greatest Importance to the American People. No single great material work which remains to be undertaken von this conti nent is of euch consequence to the Amer- lean peot.le as the building of a canal across the isthmus connecting North a: "tn' South America. Its importance to Nation is by no means -limited merely to Its material effects upon our business prosperity; and yet with view to these effects alone it would be to tne last ae. gree important for us immediately to be gin it. l am glad te be able to announce tt you that our negotiations on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mu tual good will and respect, have resulted In my being able to lay before the Senate a treaty which If ratified wll enable us to begin preparations for an istnmian can al at any time, and wblcb guarantees to this Nation every right that it -has ever asked in connection witn the canaii Honroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine should be the car- dlnal feature of the" foreign policy oi all the nations of the two Americas, it Is of the United States. Just 78 years have passed since President Monroe in his 'annual message announced that "the American continents are henceforth not to be considered us subjects for future colonization by any European power." other words, the Monroe Doctrine is declaration that there must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any Ameri can power on American soil. .

KATY DEPARTMENT. Work of Upbuilding; It Must Be Steadily Continued. - The work of upbuilding he Navy must be steadily continued. No one point of our DOiicy, foreign or domestic, is more im portant than this to the honor and ma- rial welfare, and above all to the peace. of our Nation in the future. Whether we desire it or not, we must hencefortn recognize that, we have International du ties no less than international right. Kven if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Porto Rico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian canal. we a.iuu.u neeu a uiuioua.i.y tiauicu ..Navy of adequate size, or else be prepared defin itely ana for all time to abandon the idea ' that our Nation is among those hose sons go down to the sea in ships. nlefs our commerce is always to be carried In foreign bottoms, we must have war craft to protect it. Should Be No Cessation. There should bo no cessation in the work of completing our Nav-v. So far ingenuity has been wholly unable to de- v.bb .. suuetitute tor tne great war crart wnoae hammering guns beat out tne mastery of the high seas, it is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battle-ships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and I.ghter craft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy. cut tnere is something we need even more than additional ships, and this is addi tional officers and men. To nrovide bat tle-ships and cruisers and then lay them up, witn tne expectation of leaving them unmanned until tney are needed In actual war, wbuld be worse than folly; it would oe a crime against the Nauon, The Naval Militia. The naval militia forces are ntnte mvan. lzations. and are trained for cnasl servine and, in event of war, they will constitute tne inner une oi aeiense. They should re ceive hearty encouragement from the urenerai overnmeni. But in addition we should at once pro vide for a National naval reserve nre-an- ized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and subject to the call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes imminent. It should be a real auxiliary to tne naval seagoing peace es- luuiiauiueiii, sriiu oner material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the Naval Academy, grad uates of the naval militia, officers nnrf crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels and steam yacnts, togetner witn tne coast population about such centers as life-saving stations aim iisuLiiuu&es. WAR DEPARTMENT. Army Is Large Enongrh at' the Pres ent Time. It is not necessary to increase nm Armv beyond its present size at this time. But It is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency. The individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this Army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those of any other army in the entire world. It is our duty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highest possible expression ot power to inese units when acting in combination. 'ine conditions of modern war are mich as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever before upon the individual char acter and capacity of the officer and the enlisted man, and to make it far more difficult for men to act together with ef- tecL. ai 'preacui tne ngnting must De OOne in extended order, which means that each men must act for himself and at the same time act in combination with others with wnom ne-is no longer in tne oia-fashionerl elbow-to-elbow touch. Under such con ditions a few men of the highest excel lence are worth more than many men witiioui tne special saui wnicn is only .uu.iu -3 icoun ui aimNti ironing ap plied to men of exceDtional nhvsi morale. But nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to per fect Is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring rider. The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased. General Staff. A general staff should be rrenferl. Ac for the present staff and supply depart- urciiia, tney ajiuuiu oe nuea Dy aetans from the line, the men so detailed return ing after a while to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the Army composed of men who have come to -fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A system should be adopted bv which there shall he an elimination, grade by grade, of those who seem unni to render tne Dest service in the next grade. Justice to the veterans of the Civil War who are still in the Army would seem to reauire that in the matter of retirements they be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the Navy. Field Exercises. Our Army is so small and so much scat tered that It is very difficult to give the higher officers (as well as the lower officers and the enlisted men) a chance to practice maneuvers In mass and on a compara tively large scale. In time of need no amount of individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would iniiuw inaouity to worK as a conerent whole, under skillful and daring leader ship. The Congress should provide means whereby It will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regu lars, ana, lr possible, also a division of National Guardsmen once a year. These exercises might take the form of field maneuvers; or, if on the Gulf Coast or the Pacific or Atlantic seaboard, or in the region of the Great Lakes, the Army corps wnen assemoiea snouia oe marcnea irom some inland point to some point on the water, there embarked, disembarked after a couple of - days' journey at some other point, ana again marcnea inland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching, camp ing, emouraing ana aisemoarKing, will it be .possible to train the higher officers to penorm tneir auties well ana smoothly. Reorganising the Army. Much good has already come from the act reorganizing the Army, passed early in the present year. The three prime re forms, ail of tnem of literally inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four- year details from the line for permanent appointments in the so-called staff divi sions; second, the establishment of i corps or artillery with a chief at the head; third, the establishment of a max imum and minimum limit for the Army. It woulu be difficult to overestimate the improvement in tne cmciency of our Army which these three reforms are making, and have in part already effected. , - Tolnnteer Forces. . Action should be taken In reference to the militia and to' tbe raising of volunteer forces. Our militia law la obsolete and worthless. The organization and arma ment of the National Guard of the several states, which are treated as militia in tbe appropriations by the Congress, should be made identical with those provided for tne regular forces. The obligations ana duties of the guard In time of war should be carefully denned, and a system estab lished - by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces snouia oe prescrioca in advance, it is ut terly impossible in the excitement and Haste of impending war to do this sat isfactorily if tbe arrangements have not been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called but the training of thosa. citizens who have al ready had experience- under arms, ana especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be raised for careful selection of the kind necessary Is impossible after the outbreak or war. Debt Due to the Veterans Who Savea the Union. No other citizens deserve so well ot the Republic as the veterans, the aur- - ' . ' wouio. nave meant that all else in our history went for nothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all our annals would be mean ingless, and our great experiment in pop ular freedom and self-government a Kiwmr luiiur--. Civil Service. I .recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable the President thus to extena it. In my judgment all laws providing for tne temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain provision that they be selected under the civil service law. It is important to have this system obtain at home, but it is even more lm portant to have it applied rigidly in our Insular possessions. Not an office should bo filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to tbe man's partisan affiliations or services, with any regard to the political, social or personal influence which he may have at his command; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing, save the man's own character and capacity and the needs of the serv ice. The merit system Is sln-mly one method of securing honest and efficient adminis tration of the Government; and in the long run the sole Justification of anv tvne of government lies in Its proving Itself uoto nonest ana emcient Consular Service. The consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law passed In 1S56, which is entirely inadequate to ex isting conditions. The Interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country in the reorganization of the service Is heartily commended to your at tention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in recent years been submitted to Congress. They are based upon the just principle that ap pointments to the service should be made only after a practical test of the appli cant's fitness, that promotions should be foverned by trustworlhvness, adaptabil ty and zeal in the performance ot duty, and that the tenure of office should be unaffected . by partisan considerations. Treatment of Indians. In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an indi vidual and not as a member of a tribe. The general allotment act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the family and the individual. Under its provisions some 60,000 Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should now break up tho tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands that is, they should be divided into Individual holdings. There will be a tran sition period during which tbe funds will in many cases have to be held in trust. This is the case, also, with the lands. A stop should be put upon the indiscrim inate permission of Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be stead ily to make the Indian work like any oth er man on his own ground. The mar riage laws of the Indians should be made tne same as tnose oi tne wmtes. - St. Louis Exposition. I bespeak the most cordial sup port from the Congress and the people for the St. Louis Exposi tion to commemorate the 100th an niversary of the Louisiana Purchase. - The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an exposition which will continue throughout the most of the present ses sion of Congress. I heartily commend this exposition to the good-will of the people. Library of Congress. ' Perhaps the most characteristic educa tional movement of the past 60 years is that which has created the modern pub. He library and developed it into broad and active service. There are now over 6000 public libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In addition to ac cumulating material, they are also striv ing by organization, by Improvement in method, and by co-operation, to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to makte it more widely useful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of its ad ministration. In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to tne r eaeral library, wmcn. though, still the Library of Congress, and so entitled. the one National library of the United States. Permanent Census B-arenn. For the sake of good administration. sound economy and the advancement of science, the Census Office, as now consti tuted, should be made a permanent Gov ernment bureau. This would insure bet ter, cheaper and more satisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business. but of statistic, economic and social bci ence. ' ' . The Postal Service. ,' The remarkable growth of the postal service la shown In the fact that its reve nues have -doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within 12 years. Its progressive development compels con stantly increasing outlay, but in this pe riod of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its ex penses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal ad vances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made its bene fits so plain, that the demand for its ex tension is general and urgent. It is just that the. great agricultural population should share In the improve ment of tbe service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6009, practically all established within three years, and there are fiwv applications awaiting action. It is expected that the number in opera tion at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8600. The mall will then be dally carried to the doors of 6,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been depend ent upon distant offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service. Chinese Situation. Owing to the rapid growth ot our power and our interests on the Pacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest National concern to us. The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the anti- foreign uprisings In China of 1900. having been formulated in a joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the Injured powers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese Gov ernment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the meas ures taken by China in compliance with tne demands of the joint note, and ex- pressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States. Mr. William Woodville Rockhlll, to whom high praise la due for trva tact good judgment and energy be Das displayed in performing an exception ally difficult and delicate task. The agreement reached disposes in manner satisfactory to the powers ot the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to better future re lations between China and the powers, Under the1 provisions of the Joint note of December, . 1900,. China has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navi gation and to take such other steps foi the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed.
