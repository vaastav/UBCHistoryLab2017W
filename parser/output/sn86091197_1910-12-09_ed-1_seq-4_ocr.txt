It contains seventy five pages with a cover, and is a very creditable piece of work mechanically as well as from a literary point of view. It covers the Upper Snake Rivet Valley from Blackfoot to Ashton, each town being represented by write ups and advertisements of its busi ness men. Blackfoot was very generously ac corded double the amount of space for the write-up of the town itself as was their own city of Idaho Falls. A rather amusing feature of this edition is the time at which it ap peared. It was to have come out last May, or June, and their delay of six or eight months makes some of it a little out of season. Advertising bi cycles in December raises a question of whether they are at the wrong end of the season, or preparing for an open winter. Much of the advertis ing is for real estate for the summer of 1910, and may still be effective, but some of the firms have gone out of business, moved away or gone into the hands of receivers between the time the advertising orders were giv en and the time the edition went to press, in this way badly perforating the stock expression of the publishers, "Hitch to the Po«t." But the publishers said it would "come out," and it came. Most of the advertising was paid in advance, and if the patrons were impatient they have not said as much as they might have done. Some of the candi dates who took space in view of the aid it might be to them in the cam paign of 1910 and who have since been beaten, are in a funny quandary to decide whether it was wisdom to "hitch to the Post" or whether the Post might not have brought them success if this edition had not re mained "hitched" so long.

ASYLUM SUPERINTENDENT MAY GO Last week we published a list of appointments which may be made by Governor-elect Hawley, and we have since investigated the matter of asy lum boards and superintendents. The asylum at Blackfoot Is under direction of Dr. C. A. Hoover, Repub lican, who was appointed by the board of regents, who are appointed every two years' by the governor. The Northern Idaho Asylum is gov erned in the same way, but has al ready been under direction of Dr. J. W. Givens, Democrat, who was for fifteen years superintendent at the Blackfoot Asylum, about ten years of which was under Republican gov ernors. Unlike most of the boards govern ing state institutions, the asylum boards are not appointed one member every two years, but the whole board may be discarded and a new board and a new superintendent may be put fn charge at once, leaving the whole matter in the hands of men new and unfamiliar with the problems before them. Whether the incoming Democratic administration will leave a Republi can in charge at Blackfoot as the Republicans did a Democrat for so many years remains to be seen. ONLY PARTLY TRUE Editor Porter of The Paris Post last week gave vent to his feelings in this wise: "Editors are compelled by the pro fit system to cri'ngingly stultify* them selves in order to live. There is no such thing in America as an inde pendent press. There is not one of us who dares to write our honest opinions. We are paid for keeping our honest opinions out of the paper. Any of us who would be so foljjsh as to write honest opinions would be put on the streets looking for another job. "The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, tc pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and sell his country and his race for his daily bread." The above is only partly true, but the publisher who survives knows there is enough truth in it that he has learned to close his eyes upon many things that it might be well to publish, but it would be infinitely better for his own bank account if he left it out. -o ANOTHER HEAD LOOPED OFF Boise, Dee. 2.—For reasons which he declined to discuss, Governor James H. Brady yesterday accepted the resignation of State Bank Com missioner William G. Cruse, to take effect immediately. While Governor Brady has nothing to say as to the reasons leading up to the step, he announced last night that he had not yet selected a suc cessor to Mr. Cruse, hut would prob ably do so within a day or two. In the meantime the duties of the office will be assumed' by Deputy State Bank Examiner H. S. Geary, who has been connected with die office for some time past. While the resignation of Mr. Cruse was entirely unexpected, those fam i'iar with the situation locally say that the governor has been dissatis fied with the manner'in which the bank examiner has conducted his office for some time past, freely stated that the circumstances surrounding the connection of the official with the defunct Hailley bank constituted the direct cause of the governor's step, and In" many quar ters the action of the governor In demanding the resignation of the bank commissioner was by no means a surprise.

SAYS BILL TO HARNEY President Adopts Modern Political Methods With O'Neil Wallace Banker Considers Taft One of the Best (Qualified Men for the Office—Commercial World Has Confidence in His Ability "Barney, I'm glad to meet you, but I'm sorry you're skinned," was the way President William H. Taft greeted B. F. O'Neil when the latter entered the president's office in Wash ington, D. C., a few days ago. "That is what he said," commented Mr. O'Neil today, "and he shook hands just this way," and he illus trated with a good, old-fashioned grip and pump-handle movement. "I had a pleasant visit with the president," continued the Wallace banker. "In my judgment he is one of the best qualified men to govern t.he people that we have ever had. He has a splendid legal mind, a good heart, and meets all comers on the level. Predicts Second Term "In my mind, without doubt, he will he a mighty popular man at the end of his term and I'm sure he will succeed himself. With such a man at the head of governmental affairs we can successfully look for better times if it is within his gift. The commer cial world seems to have explicit confidence In his ability. I can see where he is growing in strength every day." Mr. O'Neil had not expected to call on the president. He was in New York when lie received a telegram from Charles D. Norton, secretary to the president, stating that Mr. Taft would be glad to see the Idaho man and talk over Idaho affairs at any time it should prove convenient to Mr. O'Neil. The latter replied at once, naming the day he could be in Washington. When Mr. O'Neil ar rived at the White House he found some thirty or forty people in the waiting-room and was contemplating with some grief the prospect of wait ing until they had all been attended to. Had Open Sesame However, to his pleasure, his card brought an immediate call from the president to come in. Mr. O'Neil was closeted with the president an hour or more. What was said during that time is a matter of conjecture. Mr. O'Neil declines to discuss it. Mr. O'Neil was glad to return home. He has been in New York and other eastern places for many weeks. "As the old saying is. 'there is no place like home'," he asserted. "Par ticularly like a home among the good citizens of my own city and county and among so many good friends in the state of Idaho to whom I am so much indebted. 1 hope I will be able to reciprocate in some way for their goodness ad kindness to me." Speaking of conditions in the East Mr. O'Neil said: Good Times Coming; "The concensus of opinion there seems to be that better financial times are coming. The money situa tion seemed much easier when I left New York than it was some time ago. and everything commercially looks bright. The merchants are expecting a good business year in 1911. "The eastern people are becoming awakened to the growth and deve'op ment of the west and they are look ing this way for a future move. "While in the East 1 met many western people who were there, some on pleasure trips and others on busi ness enterprises." While at the Holland House in New York, Mr. O'Neil received a telegram from J. E. Cloghley of LaGrande, Oregon, inviting him to attend the annual Thanksgiving banquet to be held November 24 at the Dewey Pal ace in Nampa, Idaho. The telegram stated that if he did not come he would grievously disappoint 100 of the boys. Mr. O'Neil w'as compelled to send his regrets. Mr. O'Neil went to Harrison this afternoon on a business trip but will return tomorrow. -o 

CONGRESS NOW IN SESSION Washington, D. C., Dec. 6.—The reading of President Taft's annual message to congress began shortly after 12 o'clock, tt contains about 3000 words. The leading features of the mes sage are these: He declares it is time to stop leg islating with reference to regulation of corporations and to witness the effect of a vigorous execution of the laws already on the statute books. The exact limitation upon business methods imposed by law will doubt less be made clearer by pending deci sions of the supreme court. Just at this time, the president says, he believes the activities of the government, in addition to enforce ment of the laws, should be directed toward economy or administration, the enlargement of opportunities for foreign trade, the building up of home industry and the strengthening of the confidence of capital In domes
