PAGE FOUR EDITORIAL PAGE—Let the Truth Prevail! _________________________________________ ______a__a____BSß__a____a_ Message Is One Western Washington Will Approve and Applaud On the whole, the message which President Wilson today read to the assembled houses of congress Will please the progressive people of western Washington. The paragraphs dealing with preparedness, tin •abject of perhaps paramount interest, are certainly far from militaristic or jingoistic. They are no Stronger than advance press reports had intimated. Certainly \vp of the freedom-loving west will agree with the president when he says "At least so much by way of preparation for defense seems to me to be absolutely imperative now. We cannot do less." Indeed, the country probably will be bitter pleased il congress takes considerably more advanced ground on the question of national defense than does he. One disappointing feature of the message, in this regard, is that no mention is made of the question of the government's manufacturing its own munitions of war and building its own battleships. The address opens with an admirable statement of America's reasons for its position of neutrality. It turns next to our relations with Houth and Central America. Wilson seizes the opportunity to set forth an altered Monroe doctrine in which "there is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards but, Instead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, in the in terest of all America, north and south. As to Mexico, the president stands by his creod. He says, "We now hopefully await the re-birtli of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from"am outside quarter in the radical but necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will imt coerce her; and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all America that we sed< no political suzerainty or selfish control." < After dealing with the subject of military preparedness, the president turns to the highly important question of a merchant marine, He advises the immediate establishment of a government-owned fleet »-»■ —— mtrnm wwmm i < Henry and Noah Speaking of the ridicule of Ford's peace voyage, his side-partner, Mr. B^yan, says that "if any peo ple on Noah's ark had been making money out of the flood, they would probably have ridiculed Noah for Sending out the dove." Not probably, but certainly, Mr. Bryan. We haven't complete reports on what took place on that ark. Very likely, some fellow aboard, who had enjoyed a monopoly in water cress, rice, water lilies, or such, admired that rainfall and hooted the idea that 40 days and nights was enough of it. There were in that boat Noah, Shorn, Ham, Japheth and their wives. \t would be another miracle of high class if, in that crowd of eight there wasn't one who kicked on anything tending to break up the pleasant life of security, comfort and ease, after an hundred and fifty days of it. With this proposition established as premises, it is legitimate to conclude that Noah really was ridi culed, since he was 600 years old and it. was reasonably safe to do it, for it will be remembered that Noah, desiring a port, maybe desiring peace for family reasons, first sent forth a raven, which was lost, and then a dove, both failing to find what Noah was after. Ke undoubtedly got ridiculed for sending out for land when there was nothing but water, just as Ford is getting it for sending out for peace when there's noth ing but war. I Then, what did Noah do! Say, what did Noah do then? Why, he gave the flood a chance to subside somewhat, sent out the dove again and got an olive twig, which indicated that there was some show for a safe landing. This gave him tlie laugh on Shem or Ham, or Mrs. Sheni or Mrs. Ham, or more likely Mrs. Noah, who had made fun over his losing that raven. i The similarity between the voyages of Noah's ark and Henry's Oscar is striking, up to the present, and Mr. Bryan's reference to the matter is a neat hit Romance In Commonplace Lives We are all accustomed to look upon ourselves as eommonplaise. We are apt to see only dullness in our neighbors'lives. We mourn because we thing romance is confined to fiction or the stage. And we even go to the movies to seek the romance which we miss at home. But where did the story, the play, and the film udventure come from, if not from real life? 

QUESTIONS THEY WRITE TO I -«-««- .— CYNTHIA GREY--HER ANSWERS | ZspT^JTJ^ Dear Miss Cray: lam a widow, alone. I have a good posi tion —1 get $7 a week and board myself. That Bounds easy, but I am also supporting my children. I pay $5 a week for their board, and out of the remaining $2 I am clothing them and m> self, also feeding myself. lam well, thank Ood, or I couldn't stand it. Now what I want to know is this —should I struggle on until "something" happens, or shall I find homes for my babies. It breaks my heart to see Christmas coming on, and—oh well, what's the use? I went to a picture show a short time ago and it Is said "what Is the reward of right living?" The answer waa "untainted moth erhood." Now I gave my babies this, and they are all the world to me. I cuddled and loved them just as all mothers do, and now I must give them away. Any old squaw in the United States can keep her babies. Uncle Sam sees to it that she can, but we American mothers mast grit our teeth and smother back the heart-breaks and give our babies away. If I could have the dearest wish of my heart, do you know what it would be? —work where I could send my children to ■ehool, and lie able to get home in time to fly a nice supper for them when they returned. A terribly er pensive hope, isn't it? Yet I can't have it. I must find homes for them. Then, supposing I do, what will be come of me? I surely need advice. Shall I struggle .on, or try tc* find them homes? Tell me— MOTHER. A.—You certainly are in need of aid and encouragement, you poor, discouraged woman- lint cheer up! IHd yon never hear of the mother's penaki_? It waa created for JuHt such mothers as you.

Then see the Juvenile judge. They are good men, and will Ind- you. Don't look nn the dark Hide. There la always some aid for a worthy mother. If you <!•> not succeed In getting a pension, please write me again, dear, and I will have some further advice. Dear Miss Orey: You give such sensible advice to others, will you please tell me what to do? lam staying at my father's (he is a widower), and keep ho use for him and one boarder. I have a baby of about six months. My husband works away from home and comes home only once in two or three weeks, to spend Sunday. Do you think I should pay board? Ido all the housework. I have to care for my baby, too. I have also been reading "Confessions of a Wife," but un fortunately did not get tha first of it. 1 am very much Inter ested and would like to get it all. Can you tell me where I could get it or th? first of It? I certainly do not blame Margie for not wanting Mrs. Waverly to live with her- 8. A.

Your efforts In keep ins the house for him not only are worth a great deal financially, but they furnish him with homelike -urronndlng- that he would not have otherwise. Ido not believe he expect** an] thing more from yon. rnfortunatety, "The Confections of a Wife" hare never been pnlilished in book form, although they undoubtedly will be when the series of diary note* Is complete. TBI TAOOMA TIMIA of freight earners, the need for which Secretary McAdoo, in a special article written for this paper, so strikingly set forth a few days ago. Discussing the revenue situation. President Wilson points out that $112,000,000 of additional income will be needed by the goveninient for the coming year. He recommends that all the present taxes be continued and the added sum be provided by one or more of several easy methods. One of the striking passages in his message is his declaration against the proposal for raising any of this money by the sale of bonds. "It seems to me a clear distate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance," says he, "that in what we are now, I hope, to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry, and to know from the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation." Suggestions which ho advances along this line are for increasing the income tax rates, and levying taxes on gasoline, automobiles, bank checks and fabricated iron and steel. One of the strongest passages inihe whole message is directed against the "hyphenated" citizens of this nation who have been plotting to destroy our industries, to involve the national neutrality and to pry into national secrets for the benefit of European governments. The president rightfully urges that laws be passed making it possible to punish such wrong-doers with deserved severity. Inline with other lessons taught by the great war are the concluding section of the message, which propose a study to lead to the complete co-ordination of our industrial and transportation systems for the national defense. On the whole it is a message, not only TO you and me, but FOR you and me to congress. And that is what a president's annual address should be. X
