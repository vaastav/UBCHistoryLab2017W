S.--The stats concluded today its cross examination of W. R. Patterson, father-in-law ot Gaston B, (Means, on trial here charged with the murder of Mrs. IMaude A. King; without bringing out anything materially to break down his testimony of yesterday to the ef fect that the 1 defendant's business transactions with Qirs. King's money were legitimate and with her knowl edge and approval. Reading of let ters written toy Patterson to Means Patterson, and other members of their party had arrived in Ashevflle from Chicago and had fceen installed In a hotel, occupied most of the morning session. "OM Seventy Six" Patterson wrote to (Means, referring to Mrs. Robinson, mother of (Mrs. King, "has settled down after fluttering around a while like an old hen after scratching up her nest.' " IMaude has trimmed her sails," wrote the witness, tout he did not see much prospect of any successful flirt ations. Later he wrote that "Maude" had ceased her flirtations, as aibout all the men at the hotel were married. In one letter Patterson, writing from Aaheville to (Means in New York, suggested Insistently that au tomobile drives in the mountains would keep Mrs. King in good frame ofl mina and "keep her from rocking the boat." The party was comfortable in the resort hotel, but the expenses, $84 a week and upward for each room, were considered excessive. C. A. Rambaiugh, a mechanical en gineer of Ashevflle, qualified as an ex pert in firearms and testifying lor tne defense, declared that from, experi ence and observation study he tad learned that a 25 caliber automatic pistol was liable to be fired at any time by a jar. He testified that In his opinion Mrs. King could have held the pistol in a position, to Inflict a wound found in her head. London, Dec. 5. President Wilson's message to congress has full prom Ihence in the morning newspapers, but it reached London too late for much considered comment The Dally News receives warmly the president's declaration that peace should te based on generosity and Justice to the ex clusion of selfish claims. It adds: 'It would be affectation to pretema this language echoes the declarations of the European spokesmen of the Al liance. It is the voice of a statesman whoso vision comprehends the world, while theirs comprehends only half a world. "If President Wilson could have said earlier what he said yesterday and if in Great Britain, France and Italy the responsible leaders had made his language their own, Russia might ibe today driving the enemy from her 'borders. The Times says there are no half tones in the president's address, add ing: There are no ambiguous phrases on which militarists may feed the il lusions of their dupes, no hints of compromise and no suggestion of fal tering or doubt to raise the spirits ot the pacifist With this straightforward and logical statement of America's war alms the last hope of the pacifists must founder." The Daily Graphic says: "Whether this re-statement, so lofty in spirit, so forward looking in effect, will' have any Influence on, German opinion Is doubtful. Then the only resort is to Inflict such a military defeat on Ger many as to convince the Germans of the infamousness of their rulers," None of the editorials dwells espec ially on the reqest for a declaration, of war against Austria, but brief refer ences imply that it is regarded as log ical and desirable. Be saving but not miserly. Beeconom ical and make every dollar do its duty. Waste nothing. But don't let your heart grow cold and don't forget that Christmas is the biggest day in all the year for the children. Each $50 of furcoat value is now$40.

Hol comb and the state war council by Judge W. D. Makepeace chairman of the Waterbury town committee of the council of defense; and Mayor Scully, who were given a hearing In the mat ter before a recent meeting of the council.
