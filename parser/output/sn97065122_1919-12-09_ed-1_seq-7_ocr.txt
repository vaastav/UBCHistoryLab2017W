A new contest between the democratic administration and the republican congress over revision of revenue laws is apparently approach ing. Both administration and congres eional leaders agree there must be re- -vision to meet record peace time ex penditures but agreement ends there Secretary of the Treasury Glass, backed by President Wilson, wants a , revision started at once, Republican leaders say it will not be done at this session of congress. Glass, again backed by the presi dent, wants excess profits taxes abol ished and an increase in the normal income tax rate and the surtax rate on intermediate incomes. Republi an leaders say they are doubtful about raising sufficient revenue If this is done. The president in his message to congress came but strongly against tariff legislation. Congressional leaders say a new tariff should be nacted although they doubt the ad visability of doing this knowing the president would veto the bill. The revenue bill for 1920 was enacted at the last session of the 65th congress. Glass contends that the present , session should frame a bill for 1821 so that business will know in advance what taxes it would "have to pay and the government can prepare its machinery for tax collec tion. "There will be no general revision at this session," said representative Longsworth, Ohio, a member of the bouse ways and means committee. There is a tradition that the party which frames a revenue measure just before election fares badly at the hands of the voters, but congressional leaders deny they have this possibili ty in mind in delaying. Glass in his annual report in con gress declared the excess profits tax "encouraged Wastful expenditure, puts a premium on overcapitalization and a penalty on brains; discourages new ventures and confirms old ven tures in their monopolies." He also put upon it part of the blame for high prices. "I do not think the ways and means mmittee is likelv to follow this suggestion," was the answer Rcpre nentative Green, Iowa, made to Glass Green, next to Chairman rorciney, is ranking member of the committee "There are many objectionable features connected with the excess profits tax but the reduction in rates will migrate its application," Green continued. "It has one merit that is often overlooked, namely, that only those who are making high profit pay it." ' The 1820 revenue code will raise $4,000,000,000, it is estimated and about a billion and a quarter of this mm from excess profits. If this source of revenue were abolished, contrress would have to find some thing to take its place since expendi tures are not expected to be less than i nnn nnft.OOO annually for some T'v" , years. To make up for loss through the abolition tax, Glass suggested a raise in the normal income tax rates and 1 - a raise in the surtax rate on muuium sized incomes. 4 To this Green says; "It would be extremely difficult to obtain the amount produced by. the excess profits tax from incomes. It is well that the multi-millionaires are already transferring their holdings to tax exempt securities. I think the same result would follow if we un dertook to raise intermediate rates as suggested by the secretary's re port." President Wilson, in his message, advised against a high tariff, warn ing that it might prevent Europe pay ing her debts to the United States in goods. , Green says a higher tariff is the ,'mqst natural method of increasing our revenues." The low rate of for eign exchange, he says, have reduced "even the low rates of the Underwood bill." PET

Senator Boise Penrose and other influential Republican leaders are be ing counted on to swing the 1920 Re publican National , convention to St. Louis when the national corumittee selects the convention city at a meet ing in Washington tomorrow. St. Louis is sending a delegation of twenty-five leading Republicans to the meeting to back up the support of party leaders. The first representative convention in years will result from choosing St, Louis, delegates from St Louis will insist. They plan to offer the na tional committee convention expenses and convention tickets. v Previous convention cities have handed out tickets as they saw fit resulting, St. Louis delegates insist, on exclusion of those from other cities. "We will offer the national com mittee all expenses, such as the con vention hall, decorations and other things said John Schmoll, Republican city committeeman. We will offer them all tickets free. The expense of the convention probably will be about $35,000. "In addition hotels have agreed to charge regular rates. This is a close state And bringing the convention here will do considerable good to the republican cause. , "We will have four thousand rooms to accommodate convention delegates, and in addition the Coliseum here is amly large, seating fourteen thou sand. Paul V. Bunn, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce pointed out that St. Louis' already has entertain ed three national political conven tions. "We sent a delegation to Chicago recently to aid in securing the convention for St. Louis. Anoth er delegation of thirty or forty is go ing to the Washington meeting. St. Louis is accessible from all parts of the country and is a natural conven tion city. The Coliseum has proved adapted to political convention needs and St. Louis is better fitted to care for the visitors."

PAUL, Minn., Dec, 9. (United Press.) The Twin Cities of the North have combined In an effort to bring the national convention' of the Republican Party here in 1920 if the national executive committee decided against Chicago as the meeting place. Gustav Lindquist, secretary to gov. ernor Burnquist and member of the national executive committee, start ed the boom for the Twin Cities in the fight for the convention. He pointed out the fact that the north west normally delivers a Republican mapority. The Minneapolis Chamber of Com merce decided to lend its support to St. Paul in the capital city's cam paign for the convention. D. V. Cavanaugh, chairman of the convention committee of the St. Paul Association has laid plans to attract the convention here. Chicago, it is reported here, may be decided upon as the permanent meeting place of the Republican par ty conventions and if it is, the Twin Cities will make no effort to get the convention.

"Miss Jones always seems a nice obliging sort of girl" "Oh, she's all that. But she will keep interrupting me when I'm dic tating to ask me how to spell words." "That certainly is a great waste of time."

A building campaign, unequaled in scope in the history of South Ameri ca is soon to be started in Buenos Aires, if the predictions of American business and construction men here are successful. The construction slump of six years is expected to be followed by a wave of activity in the building line designated to relieve the uncomfortable house, apartment and office shortage, from which this city has been suffering for three years, Unless American capital can be in terested in investments , in Buenos Aires real estate the financing wil be done almost wholly by British and French interests, and it is predicted that building on a wholesale scale wil be started as soon as the British and French exchange once more approach the normal. It is not anticipated that American capital will cut a great fig ure in the building "drive" in which it is believed that the expenditure will reach at least $200,000,000. Buenos Aires really is "in a bad way" for houses and apartments, Construction has not kept pace with the constant influx of new residents during the past year. Rents have soared to unexpected heights. Apartment houses have not yet gained great popularity with the na tive or Spanish-speaking resident. Europeans and Americans are per fectly "at home" in them as long as they can keep their minds off the rent theey must pay. Few people are mov ing The operation of changing donv lciles is like the old children's game of "puss In the corner." When family succeeds in getting an apart uia ""'h " ment and furnishing it, it is I of holding on "until death do1 a case doth them part." Families who find it necessary to leave the country for as long as a year or two invariably sub-let their apartments furnished for a consider ation that removes much of the sub- Btance from a comfortable income. For four and five room furnishad apartments, $200, $300 and $400 a month is asked and paid without a kick. In the very few apartment ' houses that have gone up in the past years, every apartment , was spoken for long before the building was completed. Conditions are just as bad in one family houses. Much valuable space goes to waste from an American or a European viewpoint in these hous es. The Argentinian must have his patio or garden which is located in the center of the house, bounded on two sides by the front dcor and the kitchen. It would be a task of many years to educate the people out of the patio idea, if it is ever undertaken. Buenos Aires is literally sprinkled with magnificent' residences of pala tial type and great dimensions. Some, of these homes occupy more ground space than some of the larger hotels In New York City, and at least half of them are larger than the private homes of American millionaires on Fifth Avenue and elsewhere. It is a common practice for a member of a wealthy ranch owning family to build one of these houses and furnish it, then never live in it. Many of these homes stand monuments to the wealth and prosperity of the- country, typical of the pride of their owners and rep resenting a misapplication of scarce and still expensive building material and of labor, which, if employed in a less pretentious and more utilita rian cause would aid greatly in pro viding sheltering roofs for people in more moderate circumstances. Real estate values in Buenos Aires are inflated. Several years ago a great property boom boosted the price of real estate. Then the bottom of prices fell out, but the greater part of the property owners, who acquired their holdings during the boom still retain the boom-day's valuation and decline to accept a loss. In the poorer districts there are blocks and blocks of dwellings, many of which are nothing more than mis- erable hovels. In these districts, al- though Buenos Aires is generally rated as a clean city, the sanitation has been miserr.ble. Under the Irig oyen administration much is being done to improve these conditions, but they still exist pretty generally. The modern office building in Bue nos Aires cr.n still be counted on the fingers of one hand. While office rent is not exactly exhorbitant it is almost impossible to obtain offices in the center of the city, standpoitnintbpricediratedonfaprantt When building is resumed in ear nest here it is believed that attention will be given to the lack of office space, and that the new buildings will be of the modern type, patterned iTeatly after the model of the Amer ican office building minus the afo Farm Bargains for Sale 90 acres, S miles from town, right on good pike road, 2 good dwelling house?, 2 good barns, good spring, in a quarter mile of railroad station.: one-fourth mile, of good school andj church, in 2 miles of good high school, , good orchard and plenty of timber on place.
