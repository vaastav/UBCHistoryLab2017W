MESSAGE. i To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: : Tribute to McKinley. I The congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity. On .the 6th of September President 1 McKinley was shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American ex position at Buffalo, and died in that r city on the 14th of that month. t Of the last seven elected presidents he is the third who has been mur dered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm t among all loyal American citizens. I Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third assassination of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister significance.. Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history; President Lin coln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by fQur years of civil i war, and President Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a. disappointed office seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belong ing to that body of criminals who ob ject to all governments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities in cident to public life. His political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates. To a standard of lofty in tegrity in public life he united the tender affections and home virtues which are all important in the make up of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him for he never acted with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those murderous crimi nals who seek to excuse their crimi nality by asserting that it is exercised for political ends, inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. President -McKinley was a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang Sfrom the sturdy tillers of the soil, who had himself belonged among the wage workers,- who had entered the army as a private soldier. Wealth Ss not struck at when the president gaseassinated, but the honest toil is content with moderate gains 4a lifetime of unremitting labor, f t he se rvice of the public '. lhIrespoaulhle or vidual. The blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage worker has ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to public office. President McKinley filled that political office for which the entire people vote, and no president-not even Lincoln him self-was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought out wishes of the people. His-one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people, to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their thought after hav ing endeavored to guide that thought aright. He had just been re-elected to the presidency because the major ity of our citizens, the majority of our farmers and wage workers believ ed that he had faithfully upheld Lneir interests for four years. They felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him. They felt that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals and aspirations, that they wished him to continue for another four years to represent them. And this was the man at whom the assassin struck! That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas-like infamy of his act, he took advantage of an occasion when the president was meeting the people gen erally, and advancing as if to take the hand outstretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous confi dence of the victim into an oportunity to strike the fatal blow. There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime. The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days, while the president yet hovered between l.fe and death. it last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the lips .that even in agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his mur derer, of love for his friends, and of unfaltering trust in the will of the most high. Such a death crowning the glory of such a.life, leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own character, that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who is dead, but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements -of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death. When we turn from the man to the nation, the harm done is so great as to excite gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most reso lute action. This criminal was a pro fessed anarchist, inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utter ances of those who on the stump and in the public press appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed. envy and sullen hatred. The wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped. This ap plies alike to the deliberate dema gogue, to the exploiter of sensational ism and to the crude and foolish vis ionary who, for whatever reason, apologizes for crime or excites aimless discontent. '·le blow was aimed .ot at -this president, but at all presidents, at every symbol of government. Presi dent McKinley was as emphatically the embodiment of popular will of the nation, expressed through the forms of law, as a New England town meet ing is in similar fashion the' embodi ment of the law-abiding purpose and practice of the people of the town. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the president be accepted as due to protest against "inequalities an the social order ," save as the murder of all the free men engaged Sin a town meeting coula be accepted Is a protest against that social in qi.uality which puss a malefactor in lail. Anarchy is no more an expres sion of "social discontent" than pick ing pockets or wife beating. The anarchist, and especially tie anarchist in the United States, is, 3 merely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because t he represents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who ad vocates anarchy directly or indirectly, t in any shape or fashion, or the man f who apologizes for anarchists and D their deeds, makes himself morally r accessory to murder before the fact n The anarchist is a criminal whose e perverted instincts lead him to prefer Sconfusion and chaos to the most e benificent torm of social order. His i protest of concern for working men Sis outrageous in its impudent falsity; d for if the political institutions of this t country do not afford oportunity to t every honest and intelligent son of e toil. then the door of hope is forever t closed against him. The anarchist e is everywhere not merely the enemy g of system and of progress, but the , deadly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy e is triumphant, its triumph will last e for but one red moment, to be suc b ceeded for ages by the gloomy night t of despotism. For the anarchist him ii self, whether he preaches or practices a his doctrines,"we weed not have one r, Particle more concern than for any Sordinary murderer. - There are no a wrongs to remedy ln.hl oBae. The ir cause of his crimlialityW .: b~ touad I- in his own evil pas.alo 'i ad ta evil conduct of those who urge him on, not in any failures in others or iby the state to do justice by him and his. He is a malefactor and nothing else. He is in no sense, in no shape, or no way, a "product of social con ditions," save as a highwayman is "produced' uy the fact that an unarm ed man happens to have a purse. It is a travestyupon the great and holy names of liberty ana freedom to per mit them to be invoked in such a cause. No man or body of men preach ing anarchistic doctrines should. be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder or some speci fied private individual. Anarchistic speeches, writings and meetings are essentially seditionF and treasonable. I earnestly recommend to the con gress that in the exercise of its wise discretion, it should take into consid eration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meetings to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy, perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigorous punishment. They and those 'like them should be kept out of the country; and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came, and far reaching provisions should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thoughe of the congress. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions. An archy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the laws of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade; for it is of far blacker infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all the civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with the crime. A grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken the life of the president. The people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in his behalf. So far from his deed being committed on behalf of the people against the government, the government wasoblig ed at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant ceath at the hands of the people. More over, his deed worked not the slight est dislocation in our governmental system, ~nd the danger of a recur rence or~suci deeds, no matter how great it might grow, would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of or der. No man will ever be restrained from becoming president by any fear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the president's life became great it would mean that the office would more and more come to be filled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in deal ing with every friend of disorder. This great country will not fall into anar chy, and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its in stitutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines. 'Ine American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled The Trusts. During the last five years business confidence has been restored and the nation is to be congratulated because f its present abounding prosperity. Such prosperity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy snough to destroy it by mischievous aws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if flood or drought comes, human wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us against the conse quences of our own folly.. The men who are idle or credulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work by head and hands, but by gambling In any way, are always a source of menace, not only to themselves, but to others. If the business world loses its head, it loses what legislation can not supply. Fundamentally the wel fare of each citizen and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens, which makes the nation, must rest upon individual thrift, and energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this individual capacity; but, wise legislation and honest and intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope, the larg est opportunity to work to good effect. The- tremendous and highly complex industrial development, which went on with ever accelerated rapidity dur ing the latter ._alf of the nineteenth century, brings us face to face at the beginning of the twentieth with very serious social problems. The old laws and the old customs, which had almost the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumu lation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive power of mankind, they are-no longer sufficient. The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth' of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very large indi vidual, and especially of very large corporate fortunes. The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, operat ing in other countries as they operate in our own. The process has aroused much antagonism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, the wage work er, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in tlis country and at the present timne.- There have been abuifes connected 'with the collection of weajth, yet it remainuo true that the fortu a accumulated-in legtimate !bu.si ..t be-.,AcumnlaIted by. the rne ý .
