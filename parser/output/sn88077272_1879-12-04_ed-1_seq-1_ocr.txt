Some months ego Charles Norman moved bis family from the town oi Flowery Branch taElberton, more that 100 miles distant. But in the hurry of moving Mr. Norman forgot to let bis dog, Watch, out of the kennel or dog, house, and did not think of it until he and all the family were in the cart bound for Elberton. Little Willie Nor man was vnry sorry, "for be and Watch were particular friends, and, though the Gazette doesn't say so, it is likely thai ' Willie cried over leaving Watch. One week went by, and the Normans had nearly forgotten Watch, when the dog suddenly appeared while the family were at dinner at Elberton. Watch en tered the room with an air of injured innocence and was soon welcomed by all hands. The strange thing about it is bow in the world Watch could have found the family.'. He probably fol lowed the trail to the depot and intt the same, car, and then rode in the cat under the same seats that bad been oc cupied by the family, until the train stopped at Elberton.

First grace was said, then soup was served a piece oi bread being folded in each napkin. First, though, I must tell you how the table was laid. In the center of the table was a glass oenter piece filled with flowers. In front of this, on a raised fruit-dish, lay an uncut Spanish melon. On either side of the flower-piece was a dish of ripe English gooseberries and French cherries, and opposite the melon a dish of white grapes. Between the dishes of fruit stood a small vase of cut flowers.- On the top of each dish of fruit was laid some kind of mossy green stuff from the oonversatory, making it look very pretty. By each fruit-dish lay a golden spoon. After soup was brought boiled salmon with sanoe; then plates removed and lobster patties were served; then plates removed and roast lamb placed before the master of the bouse. Pota toes and green peas were served with the lamb. Two kinds of pudding were next brought, with a red wine sixty years old. After pudding appeared two kinds of jellies and a dry white wine. Alter jellies came the fruit. Then the ladies retired to the drawing-room, where coffee was served, the gentlemen . remaining in the dining-room to have their coffee and smoke." Indianapolit JoumaVt New York letter. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO THE FORTY-SIXTH CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. Fellow-CilaeM of tki Senate and Hou no Re pratntattvtt : The members of the Forty-sixth Uragress have assembled in their first regular session under cirenmstanoes calling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of all good for tbe large and unusual measure oi national prosperity which we now enjoy. OF THE UNITED STATES. THE MOST INTERESTING EVENTS Which have occurred in our publio affairs since my last, annual message to Congress are con nected with the financial operations of the Government, directly affecting the business in terests of the country. I oonirratulate Cons-resa on the successful execution of the Resumption Act. At the time fixed, and i-. the manner contemplated by law, United States notes be gan to be redeemed in coin. Sine the 1st of January last they hare been promptly re deemed on presentation, and in all business transactions public and private, in all parts of the oountry, they are received and paid as the equivalent ot coin. The- demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bul lion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed Is aboutMO, 000,000. The resumption of specie payment has been followed by a great revival of bnsiness. 

IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC CREDIT. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent, interest have been sold at about par, sufficient in' amount to pay off all of tbe National debt which was redeemable under present. lawj The amount of interest 'saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, 'and the num ber of ouroitUens now holding the publio se curities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the National debt which ma tures within less than two years is $792,121,700. of which' $600,000,000 bears interest at the rate of S per cent.; and the balance is in bonds, bearing Spar cent, interest. vlt is believed that --this part of the public debt can be refunded by . the issue ' ot four per cent, bonds, and by the . reduction of interest which will thus be. effected about $11,000,000 can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by tbe United States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session. I would, however, strongly nrge upon Con gress the importance of Authorising tbe Secre tary of the Treasury to suspend the .... COIiriOI OF 

8ILVIB DOLLARS Upon the present legal rate. - Tbe market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it ia obviously impracticable to main tain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. .If the cheaper ooin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined with out limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat tbe desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, bich snail be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognised money ot the world. The retirement from cir culation of United States notes with the capa city of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress' toward safe and staoie currency, wnicn snouid be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government, and tbe interest and: security oi tbe people. It is my firm oonviction that the issue of legal ten der paper money, based wholly upon the au thority and credit, ef the Government, except in cases ef - extreme emergency, is without warrant in tbe Constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitution, has been to avoid tbe creation of a NATIONAL DEBT, And when from necessity, in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possi ble, w ltn this view, and tor this purpose, it is recommended that the existing lawr for the accumulation of a Sinking Fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited ' .1 i i fjenuu w uiniuwiuvut . .. IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC CREDIT. POLYGAMY. The continued deliberate violation by large number of the prominent and influential citiiens of the Territory of Utah- of the Jaws of the United States for tbe prosecution and punishment of polygamy merits tbe attention ot every Department oi tne uovernment. 1 nis territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State. . This important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the oitiiens of Utah in very con siderable number uphold a practice which is condemned aa a crime by the laws of all civil ised communities- throughout the world. The law for tbe suppression of this offense .was en acted with great unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently-a dead letter in the Territory of Utah. . . The opinion widely prevailed among the cit- tens of Utah that the law was in contraven tion of the Constitutional guarantee of relig ious freedom. This objection is now removed The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within tbe legislative power of Congress, and binding as a rule action tor an wuo reside wrtnin tne territories. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stingent in its provisions should be amended. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exer cise of the rights and privileges of citisenship tn the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on subject. The election of the past year, thongh occupied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit in the -political discussions which attend them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citisens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of tbe elective tranobise. " While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of National and State authority, I find no rea son to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message that no temporary for administrative interests of Government, hoif ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace the seal ot our people in oeiense oi tne primary rights of citUenship, and that the power public opinion, will override all political preju dices. X respecnuuy nrge upn vongress supply any defects in the laws which experi ence has shown and which it is within power to remedy. 

CIVIL SERVICE. The grave evils -and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office, and omce tenure, are now generatly recognised, In the resolutions of the great parties, in reports oi Departments, in. tbe debates proceedings of Congress, in the ' messages Executives, the gravity of the evils has been pointed out, and the need of thejr reform been admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure ot reform must based on common right and justice and must compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential a free State. When the people have approved a policy a National election, confidence on the part tbe o racers they nave selected, and ot tbe visers who in accordance with our political institutions snouid no consulted in- tbe policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, indispensable. It is eminently proper they should explain It before the people, well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of tbeir official duties. It hardly need be pointed ont that very differ ent considerations apply to the greater num , her of those who fill the subordinate places the Civil Service. Their responsibility is their superiors in official position. It is duty to obey the legai instructions of upon whom that authority is devolved, their best public service consists in the dis charge of their functions irrespective of par tisan politios. Their dnties are tbe same whatever party is in power, whatever policy prevails. ' - as a eonsequenoe, it louows that tneir tenure of office should not depend on the pre valence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, bnt should be determined by their ca pacity to serve tne people most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan interests. Tbe same consideration that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the appointment, dis cipline and removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite which may be used to aid a friend or remove a partisan ; but is a trust to be exer cised in the publio interest under all tbe sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the publio funds only for public purposes. Ever.7 citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public service of his country. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem dear that a wise and just method of ascertain ing personal fitness for office must needs be an important and permanent function of every just and wise Government. It has long since become impossible in the great offices of those having the duty of nomination and appointment to personally examine into the individual quali fications of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of the Civil Service that proportion must con-. tinue to become less. In tbe earlier years ot the Governmont ihe subordinate offioes were so few in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to per sonally ascertain the merits of candidates. Party managers and methods had not then be come powerful agencies of coercion, hostile to tne tree and just exercise or tbe appointing power.; A large and responsible part of the dutv of restoring the Civil Service to the desired purity and emciency rests on tbe president, and it has been my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and frugal measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administra tive s methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority it is in the power of the Execu tive to do much to promote such a reform. But it can not be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operauon on tne part ot congress, ana con siderable and intelligent support -among the people. . f Ketorms which challenge tbe generally ac cepted theories of parties, and demand changes in tne methods ot Departments, are not tne work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be-laid on sound principles, and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of tbeir Adversaries. PARTISAN BLACKMAIL. a There are other Administration abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap pointments and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an ab sorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only .interferes with the due discharge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my predecessors in the residential omce, ana directly within the law of 1871 already cited, I endeavored by regula tions made on tbe 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to such abnses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be neoessary, to define with precisio-e the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers ; but while their right tu hold ancHireely--express their opinions can nut be questioned, it very plain tnat toey snouid neitber be al lowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use tbe authority of their omce to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political action of those who bold different opinions. In whatever sspect considered, the practice ot making levies for party purpose upon the salaries of officers is highly demoralising to the public service, and discreditable to the ooun try. Though an officer should be as free as any other cititen to give his own money in aid. of his own opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the officers, it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear tbe tax, the excess in an inderect robbery of the public funds. . I recom mend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public enployment tne protection with whicn a great and enlight ened Nation shall guard those who are faithful in its servioe. OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGH COUNTRIES of it Have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of the laws of the maritime provinces and the action of Provincial authorities deemed - to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fisherman. The United States Min ister in London has been instructed to present a demand for $105,305.02, in view of the dam ages received by American citifens at Fortune Bay on the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject has ' been taken into consideration by the British Gov ernment, and . an early reply is anticipated upon the completion of the necessary prelimi nary examinations. The subject of our par ticipation in the Provincial fisheries as regu lated by treaty will at once be brought to the attention or tbe iinusn Uovernment, with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which was .only tempor arily adjusted by tbe Treaty ot Washington Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exporta tion of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes, wnicn nas resulted in import- ant modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion Government on the subject in the interest ot and commerce. THE FRENCH CABLE. of 10 The assent of the Government has been siven to landing on the coast of Massachusetts of a new and independent Transatlantic cable between France, by way of the French Island St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject The conditions imposed, before allowing this connection with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any existing or future lines or marine cable, and preclude amalgamation therewith : to provide i , i r niiLirn mumiLi t , i 1 , 11 141 ui u 11 1 inir tti 11 ,111,1! and people with tbose of France in the use tbe cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disadvantage ot any luture caDie communica tion between France and the United States which may be projected and accomplished our citiicns. I respectfully submit to your consideration the importance of Congressional action in this matter. MINOR FOREIGN MATTERS. of the and of has be be in at of ad is that as in to their thoBe and The questions ol grave importance with Spain, growing out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have been, for the most part, happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the Commission now sitting in Washington, tor the. decision private cases in tbis connection, will soon able to Dring lis lanors w a conclusion. Some questions with Switserland in regard to pauper ana convict emigrants nave arisen but it is not doubtful that they will be ar ranged upon a just and satisfactory haiis. With the German Empire frequent qne tions arise in connection with the subjects naturalisation and expatriation, but the im perial Government has constantly manifested desire to strictly maintain and comply with treaty stipulations in regara to them. Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portu gal, Turkey and Belgium continue amicable and marked by no incident of special import ance. , - ' A change of the personal head of the Gov ernment of Egypt has taken place. No change, however, has occurred in the relations between Egypt and tbe United States. The action the Egyptian Government in presenting to City ef New York one of the ancient obelisks which possess such historic interest is highly appreciated as a generous mars ot interna tional regard. Tbe treaty reoently made between and the United 6tates in regard to the revision 01 tormer commercial treaties, it is now lieved, will be followed hy. similar action on the part of other treaty Powers. : The attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity fund received some yesrs since from Japan and China, which, with tbeir accumulated interest, now amount to considerable sums. . - The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigrations of its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-operate in such measures as may. tend to prevent in jurious consequences to the United States. The negotiations are still proceeding, and will bei pressed with diligence. OUR SISTER REPUBLICS. : It is a gratification to be able to announce that through the judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two na tions on each side of the Rio Grande, under the instructions of their respective Governments, raids and depredations . hare greatly decreased, and in the localities where formerly most destructive, have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a confi dent expectation that the continuance of this prevalence of quiet on tbe borders will soon be come so assared as to justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to-crossing the border without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace nf the two countries. The third installment of tbe award against Mexico, nnder tbe Claims Commission of July 4, 1868, wss duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of the act of Congress providing for the same. The satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an ex pansion of our trade with Mexico, and an in creased contribution of capital and industry by our people to the development of the great re sources of that oountry. I earnestly commend to the" wisdom of Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Columbia is again fully restored by the arrival of a Minis ter from that country to the United States. This is especially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an inter-oceanic canal has recently assumed a new and important aspect, and is now nnder discussion with the Central American oountries through whose territory the canal, by the Nicaraugua route, would hare to pas's. It is trusted that enlightened statesmanship -on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely inure, to the benefit, not only of their own citisens and those of the United States, bnt of the commerce of the civilised world. Diplotauttao relations with Chili have also been strengthened by the reception of a Minis ter from that country. - Cordial, relations oontirfue with Braiil and the Argentine Republio, and trade with those oountries is improving. , A recent revolution in Tenesula has been followed by the establishment of a Provisional Government, This Government has not yet been formally recognised, and it is deemed de sirable to - await ' the proposed action of tbe people, which is expected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms Tbe subject of opening diplomatic relations with Roumania and Servia, now become inde pendent sovereignities, is at present under consideration, and is the subject of diplomatic correspondence. - There is a gratifying increase of trade with nearly all European and American oountries. audit is believed that with judicious action in regard to its development it can and wiU be still more enhanced, and that American pro ducts and manufactures will find new and ex panding markets. The' reports of diplomatie and consular officers upon this subject under the system now adopted save resulted in ob taining much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid be- foTeCongrefff and tbe pnblio trom time ume. . v PUBLIC FINANCES. The attention of Congress is called to the annual report of tbe Secretary of the Tieasurv on the condition of the public finances. ( The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year, ended June 30, 187a, were 273. 827,184.46. The ordinary expenditures for the same period were $266,947,883.53 ; leaving a surplus revenue for the year, ol $6,879,300.4)3. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending jnnecu, icou, actual and estimated, are aa follows : Actual receipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61 j esti mated receipts lor tne remaining three-quar ters of the year, $208,156,336.39 ; total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and esti mated, $288,000,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1879, actual expenditures, $91,683,385.10, and for the remaining three-quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $172,316,614.90, making the total expenditures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated surplus revenue for tbe year ending June 30, 1880, of i 24,000,000. 1 be total receipts during the next fiscal year. ending June 30, 1881, estimated, . according existing law, will be f 2B8,uuo,uuu, and tbe estt matedordjnary expenditures for tbe same pe riod will be $278,007,364.39, leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year. The large amount expended lor arrears ot pensions dur ing the last and the present fiscal year, amount ing to $21,247,249.60, has prevented the ap plication of the full amount required by law the sinking fund for. the current year; but these arrears having been substantially paid, it is believed that the sinking fund can here after be maintained without any change of ex isting law. OUR 

FIGHTING FORCES. Department estimates for the fiscal year end ing J une 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same Doing for a less sum of money than any annual estimate rendered to Congress from that De partment during a period of at-. least twelve years, aa concurs witn tbe ueneral ot tbe Army in recommending such legislation will authorize the enlistment of the lull number of 25,000 men for tbe line of the army exclusive of the 3,463 men required for detached duty, and therefore not available for service in the field. He also recommends that Congress asked to provide by law for the disposition of large number of abandoned military posts and reservations, which, though very valuable themselves, bave been rendered useless for mil itary purposes by the advance of civilization and settlement. In these several recommenda tions I concur. THE 

NAVY. 1. of The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows a continued improvement in that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been com pleted and made ready for sea. The total ex penditures of the year ended June 30, 1879, including specific appropriations not estimated tor by the Department, were $13,555,710.09, in expenses chargeable to tbe year, alter deduct ing the amount of these specific appropriations, were $13,343,317.79, but this is subject to reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants but not paid during tne year. 1 he amount of appropria tions applicable to. the last fiscal year $14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a bal ance of $1,479,954.37 remaining unexpended and to the credit of the Department on June 30, 1879. The estimates for the fiscal ending June 30, 1881, are $14,864,147.93, wnicb exceeds the appropriations for tbe pres ent fiscal year, $301,897.28. The reason this increase is explained in the Secretary's report. THE SUPREME COURT. be of a all of the The business of the Supreme Court is present largely in arrears. It can not be pected that more cases can be decided than now disposed of in its annual session, or by any assiduity tbe distinguished Magistrates who compose the Court can accomplish than is n w done. In the Courts of many the Circuits, also, the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an propriate remedy. It is believed that all done in eaoh Circuit which can fairly be pec ted from its judicial force. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General is the appointment of additional Judges and the creation of an intermediate Court.of errors and Appeals, which shall lieve the Supreme Cour. of a part of its juris diction, while a larger force is also obtained the performance of Circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to -the consideration of Con gress. It would involve, if ten additional Circuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure of not more than $60,000 a year. THE 

POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. e- -The report of the Postmaster-General testimony to the general revival of throughout the country. The reoeipts of the Poetoffice Department daring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more than tbe revenues of the preceding year. ' The amount realized from the sales of postage stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal cards was $764,465.91 more than in tbe preceding year, and $2,387, 559.23 more than in 1877. The expenditures of tbe Department were $.13,449,899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in preceding years. The expenditures during the year were. $801,- 209.7? less than in the preceding year. The amount drawn from the Treasury on ap propriations in addition to the revenues of the Department was $3,031,454.96, being 2,276, 197.00 less in tbe preceding year. Abe ex penditures for the.. fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are estimated at 39,920,9O0, and the re ceipts from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the Treasury of $7,710,900. The relations of the Department with Railroad Companies bave been harmonised, notwithstanding the general reduction by Congress of their compensation by tbe appropriation tor special facilities, and tbe Railroad restoffice lines have been greatly ex tended, especially in the Southern States. The Postmaster-General recommends an amendment of tbe law regulating the increase of compensation for increased service and in creased speed on Star routes, so as to enable him to advertise proposals for such increased service abd speed. The arrangement made" by the Postmaster-General and the Secretary ot the Treasury for the collection of duty upon books received in tbe mail from foreign coun tries bas proved so satisfactory in its practical operation that the recommendation is now made that Congress shall extend the provisions of tbe Act of March 3, 1879, under which this arrangement was made, so as to apply to all other dutiable articles received in the mails from foreign countries. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The history of the outbreak: on the White River Ute Reservation in Western Colorado has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press that its remarkable incidents need not be stated here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of the difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent further hostile contact between the Indians and 4he border settlements in Western Colorado. The other disturbance occurred in tbe Mes- calero Agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small band of mauraders, after committing many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across 'the Mexican border, and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which a comparatively small .number of Indians were engaged, are most deplora ble, a vast majority of our Indian popula tion have fully justified the expectations ot those who believe - that by humane and peaceful influences the Indian can be led to abandon the habits of savage life. The Indian policy sketched in the report ot the Secretory of the Interior, the object of wbich is to make liberal provision for the edu cation of Indian youths, to settle tbe Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give tbem title in fee in their farms, inalienable for a certain number of years, etc.. must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians. I, there fore, earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the- Government to give Indians title in tee,- unalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by . allotment. I also repeat the - rec ommendation made in my first annual mes sage, that a law be passed admitting Indisns, wbo can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to de tach themselves from their tribal relations, to tbe benefit of the Homestead Act, and to grant tbem pat-nta containing tbe same provision ot THE 

FRONTIER. 1. to to ' The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the depredations en the timber lands of the United States have been continued, and have met with considerable success. A large number of eases of trespass ers have been presented in the Courte ot the United btatea. Others bave been settled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of -the timber taken by them. The proceeds of these prose cutions and settlements turned into tbe Treas ury far exceed in amount the sums appro priated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result, bowever, consists in the fact that the destruction of our public forests by depredation, though such cases still occur, bas been greatly reduced, in extent ; and it is probable that if tbe present policy is vigorously pursued, and sufficient pro vision to that end is made by. Con gress, such trespasses, at least those on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, ex cept in tbe Territories where timber for the daily requirements of tbe population can not under tne present state ot tbe law be other wise obtained. I, therefore, earnestly invite the attention of Congress to the recommend ation made by the Secretary of tbe. Interior, that a law be enacted enabling the Govern ment to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated that aa to eon form to domestic wants and business require ments, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping destruction of the forests. The enactment of such a law ap pears to become a more pressing necessity eyery day. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. be a in There is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by scientific knowledge, yields such an inoreosed production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to wbich the encouragement of liberal appropriations can be more appropri ately extended. The omission to render such aid is not a wise economy, but on tbe contrary undoubtedly results in losses of immense sums annually that might be saved through well directed efforts by the Government to promote this vital interest. The results already, ac complished, with the very limited means here tofore placed at the command of the Depart ment of Agriculture, is an earnest of what may be expected with increased appropriations fur the several purposes indicated in the report of tne uommissioner. w una view to placing me Department on a footing which will enable to prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is established, appropriations are needed for a more complete laboratory, for establishment of a veterinary division and division of forestry, and for an increase force. The requirements for these and other purposes indicated in tbe report of tbe Com missioner under the head of the immediate necessities of the Department, will not involve any expenditure of money that the country can not with propriety now undertake in the interests of agriculture. THE 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. a out was year for at ex are that more of ap is ex Cir cuit re for In -former messages, impressed with the im portance of the subject, I have taken occasion to commend to Congress the adoption of generous policy toward the District of Colum bis. The report of tbe Uommissioners of the District herewith transmitted, contains sugges tions and recommendations, to all of which earnestly invite your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration of the views wbicu iney express as to tne urgent need of legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of the Potomac and its eastern branch within the limits of the city, and for the repair of the streets of the Capital heretofore laid witn wooden blocks, and decay rendered almost impassable, and source of imminent danger to the health of citizens. The means at the disposal of Commissioners are wholly inadequate for accomplishment of these important works, and should be supplemented by timely appropria tions from the Federal Treasury. The filling of the flats in front of the city will add to adjacent lands and parks now owned by United States alarge and valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its en tire cost, tnd will also,, as an incidental re sult, secure the permanent improvement of river for the purposes of navigation. - The Constitution having invested Congress with su preme and exclusive jurisdiction over the Dis trict of Columbia, its citizens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legisla tion affecting their interests ; and as the terri tory of this District is the common property the people of the United States, -who equally with its resident citizens are interested in prosperity of their Capital, I cannot doubt you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the oountry in any measures you RUTHERFORD B. HAYES, Executive Mansion, December 1, 1879. The Sparrow War. Once upon a time a .certain King of Prussia found fault with the sparrow, long before it was brought over here and subjected to the prevailing storm of unfriendly criticism that is not' beating upon its hardy head and ener getic struggle for existence. This mag nate aforesaid was fond of currants, big red Uutcn currants, and a row of noh- I ly-laden bushes, which his gardener was cultivating in confident pride fbr the ultimate denotation of the royal palate, was the subject of more attention from his Majesty than- the gorgeous flower parterres or the clumps of semi-tropical foliage, transplanted to please the eye, here and there throughout the prmoely gardens.' When the berries were al most blushing in full crimson beauty of ripeness, his Royal Highness made the unpleasant discovery that multitudes of sparrows not only coveted the fruit as much as.be, but that they had eaten them all before be could muster an alarm, mount guard, and pick the clus ters for himself . ' A quaint chronicler tells us, there upon, that the wrath of his Highness was not confined to a single or repeated explosions, of disgust on the garden walks, but that an edict was published at once ordering the extermination of the Pyrgita' dometticd; and, so thor oughly did the vassals of the crown carry out this law, that the unhappy sparrows were literally eliminated from the Prussian realms.' Then this old historian goes on to say that, to the great surprise of "his Majestic " the currant bushes were not perrbittod, af - Lter the expulsion of these birds, to render service after their kind, for a strange fly next year followed, and "did eate ye leaves so extensively that the shrubs again failed in bearing; and so on, season after season, until the King, weary of seeing its ravages, re voked the decree of death to the spar row, and actually paid out of the royal treasury some $809,000 in the form of rewards to his people for their zeal in bringing the exiled birds back. . Thus the sparrow, which we bave "brought over from the continent, is no stranger to persecution, and the success with which he fights for a living here augurs well for his future; but, like all people of pronounced character, be bas decided phases of good commingled with much that is as decidedly evil ; hence his friends and his foes have arisen, and the overburdened refrain of their angry disavowals and recrimina tions is spread ont within the columns of the wherever men can read in Prof. H.

Corthell, the resident en gineer at Port Eads, in' an illustrated paper -iu Scribner, writes as follows concerning the practical benefits of Capt Eads' work at South pass: It is not too broad an assertion to make, that every theory advanced by Capt. Eads, every statement made by him in reference to the channel which be should secure, and in reference to the advance of the bar in front of his works, has been fully verified by actual results. These results are all that the most sanguine anticipated, but the ob jects for whioh the jetties were - built are of far greater importance, for they affect the welfare of millions and are destined finally to exert an influence on tne wnoie country. These obiests wilt be realized in a development, and in an increasing pros perity of the Mississippi valley. - The work whioh bas been accomplished will stretch its relieving and assisting hand to the remotest frontiersman, who, knowing that an open river month will make it profitable for him to raise cereals, will cut down new forests and cultivate a larger farm. It will induce greater production everywhere in the Missis sippi vauey, ana wiia u as increasing immieration. Already the grain expert oi tne vai- ey is turning into this, its natural channel.
