Pine Run was the scene of another riot yester day morning between striking coal ininevs and men working at reduced wages. About J 3:30, when twenty-five miners were on their way to work, a squad of 200 masked men met them and demanded that they return home. This they refused to do, and the mob made an attack upon them with clubs sticks and stones. The riot lasted two hours. Ten men were injured. One Newton Camp bell was beaten insensible and his injuries are believed to be fatal. Richard Hall and Samuel Myford were also -eriously injured. The others got away with slight cuts and bruises after standing their ground for nearly two hours. The non-unionists were finally driven off and fled to places of safety.
