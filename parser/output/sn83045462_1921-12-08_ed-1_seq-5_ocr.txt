PRESIDENT Declares Mr. Harding Is Doing "Very Things for Which' He Denounced Wilson." Criticism was heaped on President Harding and other leaders of the re publican party in the Senate yester day by Senator Harrison, democrat, of Mississippi. He asserted that tlie President was doing the "very tnmgfc for which he as a senator had ae- ; nounced President Wilson.' j The President's message to ( on- J gress, he said, constituted an appeal j to partisanship and a warning to re- , publicans to disavow their allegiance to "bloc" organization. Mr. Harrison attacked the Senate republican leaders, saying they had "shifted and hopped until none of us know where or when or why." i Continuing, he said he was confident j there had been a misprint in tn? j President's message where Mr. Hard ing had expressed appreciation of the . "signal achievements" of the extra} session. What the President meant, he added, was. probably -single achievement, for otherwise the mes sage appeared "most contradictory and conflicting." . The action of the House in fixing a 50 per cent surtax rate in the revenue bill, he declared, constituted a "plain repudiation" of the executive s stand. It was apparent, he added, that the House action had "riled the President considerably." "But I insist, he said, that the progressives in the House had cour age and they told the President where to get off." . Secretary Mellon also was de nounced as seeking. Tn his annual re port of the Treasury Department, to "help along" the ideas of President Harding with respect "to relieving the rich" of heavy taxation. When Mr. Wilson opposed or urged legislation. Mr. Harrison continued, the then Senator Harding described him as a "dictator and an autocrat, and when Mr. Wilson issued his ap peal in 181S for the election of a democratic Congress Mr. Harding was eaually bitter in his denouncement. | "Yet we have the spectacle, he ? said "of the President coming here and'making a speech against the sol dier bonus, a thing unprecedented. Then, yesterday, he came here and ap pealed" to the agricultural Rroup to line up, to get behind the party ban ner."
