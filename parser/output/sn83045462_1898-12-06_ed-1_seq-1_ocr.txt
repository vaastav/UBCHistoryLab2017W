IMPORTANT SESSION YESTERDAY ? - Spaniards Playing for Time Regard ing America s Requests. LONG SESSION TODAY PARIS, Deceml>er ?'?.?The Joint commis sion met at i! o'clock this afternoon, and was still sitting as this dispatch was sent. It has developed that yesterday'6 session was of far greater importance than gener ally supposed. It resulted In the Americans uncompromisingly rejecting Spain's request that, for a term of years, the Spaniards of that country and its products be admitted to Cuban and Porto Rlcan porta under the s<lme regulations and customs tariff as American ships and products. The Spanish commission for some days I s been playing for time. The Americans v *? ar xio is f??r a decision on the question of a coaling station in t'n- Caroline islands.

This is why Spain com-ruled that the arti cles of the treaty be iisposed of in their ? whih* the Ameri ans wanted to first settle their pressing needs. riulit on I'roccdnre. The session of yesterday was practically a fight ??n the order of procedure. Finally the Ameri- ans yielded, and then the Spaniards proposed their shipping and c?_mm< r ial question, which the Americans rjjected in its entirety. Th*? session then adjourned with neither ^;de in an especially amiabv frame of mind. It is learned that there were differences of opinion among the Americans on the shipping question and numerous telegrams u re exchanged with Washington. Finally, ? e American commission was instructed to refuse, the principal reason being that Por - Ri< ? ?; a brut to 1.,- declared within the : ?<:st lin? of the I'nit'-'l States while as j r* ;.irds Cuba ihe authorities at Washing- j r.-M n 'lid mak- no promises. as the Amer f? . a tion th-*r?- is nor fixed and the fu re Cuban government must make its own treaties."

December ?>.?The heavy storm which raged throughout this reetion for nearly forty-eight hours, has subsided, and the weather today is elear and cold. There has not been such general prostration of telegraph ajid telephone wires in years as that suffered during the past two days. The wind reached a velocity of sixty miles an hour.

CABINETS SHORT SESSION All the Members Present But the Attorney General. Cuban 4tTalr? Briefly DUca???4-Ioi poHlblf to Tell When the Inland C'ltn Be Given 1>. The cabinet held a short session today, all the members being present except At torney General Griggs, who Is out of the city. There was a brief discussion of Cu ban afTairs, in view of the early approach of the time for the United States taking possession. Secretary Alger has received a letter from Gen. Wood as to conditions at Santiago. Gen. Wood says that matters of every kind are adjusting themselves to the new conditions, that people are return ing to their homes and to work, that bus intss is reviving, that churches and schools are opening, and everybody looks forward to happier and better days. The letter af forded much satisfaction to the cabinet. It is hoped by tb^ President and cabinet that the people of Havana and other Cuban cities will behave as well as those around Santiago, ns this condition will enable the 1'nited States to speedily turn the admin istration of the island over to the people, and be relieved of the heavy responsibility which will be incurred for the next few months. Kvaenatlon of Culm. It is impossible for the administration to approximate the time when the United States will withdraw fr. m the island. Some hope that this can bt done by next summer, so as to remove the troops from the dan gers of disease: but few believe that the United Suites will be able t>> fully retire in 1. ss than ten months or a year. Much de Is. it i~ said by cabinet members, on tlie sensible assistance given to this coun try by th*1 Cubans at all points. I nited Slates troops will be gradually withdrawn and th ? last soldier will leave the island just as soon as President McKinley thinks that the responsibility will permit. Nothing OIHcinl From Paris. Secretary Hay said this morning that nothing offlt ial has come from the Ameri can peace commissioners since Sunday, but that things were moving along in a fairly satisfactory way. The cabinet Is highly pleased with the manner In which the President's message was received at homi- and abroad. Foreign comment was especially pleasing. Many telegrams of congratulation have reached the White House since yesterday. The cabinet has not vet talked of cur rency legislation or the advisability of an extra session to endeavor to secure rem edial legislation. Secretary Gage ia under stood to regard the matter as of great Im portance, sufficient to justify an extra ses sion if the republicans can reach anything like an agreement upon a measure.

WHITE IIIM SE CtLLEK.S. The President Could tiive Visitor* Only an Hour. There was only an hour at the disposal if the President for visitors at the White House today, the time for tho cabinet to assemble being 11 o'clock. Daring the hour, however, the President received and talked with many distinguished callers, most of whom merely desired to pay their respects. From the House side were Speaker Reed, Representatives Henderson. Perkins, Wm. Alden Smith. Wadsworth, Alexander, Hop kins. Johnson of North Carolina, Burleigh of Maine and Fowler of New Jersey. The Senate was represented by Senators Alli son. Piatt, Culiom, IJndsey, Deboe, Nelson, Hawley and Sewell. Ex-Vice President Devi P. Morton was another caller. He said that he was In the city to attend the marriage of a rela tive. and wanted to pay his respects to the President. There was general commendation among the callers of the President's message. It was spoken of as a wise, statesmanlike doc ument. Representative Wm. Alden Smith said to day that there oug'ht to be an extra ses sion of Congress. "I do not care about the political effect. We ought to carry out our promises." Directly opposed to this view is the posi tion of Mr Hopkins of Illinois. "There ought not to be an extra session," he said, "and I do not think there will be." When Senator Llndsey was asked about the ratification of a peace treaty he an swered that "treaties of peace are gener ally ratined," meaning that the Spanish American treaty was not likeiy to prove an I exception to the rule.

HOLD COLONIES Senator Vest's Resolution Denying Existence of the Power. FIGHT AGAINST EXPANSION OPENS House Adjourn# From Respect to Dead Representatives. DEFICIENCY BILL .REPORTED Senators were slow in assembling at to day's session. Soon after the session was called to order former Vice President "Levi P. Morton of New York appeared on the floor. He was given a cordial greeting by his friends among the senators. The credentials of Nelson W. Aldrich for a new term as senator from Rhode Island for six years from March 4, 1899, were pre sented. They were signed by EHsha Dyer, "governor. captain general and commander in-chief of the state of Rhode Island and Providence plantation." Mr. Morrill gave notice that on Tuesday next he would address the Senate in favor of the bill to provide a building for the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Pettigrew t.S. I>. > offered a resolution, which was adopted, calling upon the Sec retary of the Interior for Information con cerning the region south of and adjoining the Yellowstone National Park and con cerning the preservation of the game in that region. \o Power lo Hold Colonic*. Mr. Vest (Mo.) offered the following joint resolution, which he asked might lie on the table, as he desired to speak on it at an early day: "That under the Constitution of the United States no power is given to the federal government to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies. "The colonial system of European nations cannot be established under our present Constitution, but all territory acquired by the government, except such small amount as may be necessary for coaling stations, correction of boundaries and similar gov ernmental purposes, must be acquired and governed with the purpose of ultimately organizing such territory into states suit able for admission into the Union." Consideration of bills on the calendar was then taken up. A measure, reported favorably at the last session, amending ex isting law relating to the issuing of Amer ican registry to foreign-built ships wreck ed in the United States, purchased by cit izens of the United States and repaJ.vd to the extent of three-fourths of their value, was discussed. The bill provides that if such a wrecked ship be employed In the coastwise trade it shall be subject to for feiture. Our General Carrying; Tra?le. Mr. Vest, a member of the committee on commerce, expressed his opposition to the bill, principally because it afforded protec tion to the coastwise trade, which needed no protection. Our general carrying ttade, Mr. Vest believed, needed protection. Under the present system of navigation laws this trade had decreased from T."? per 'ent to 11 per cent, and tills country is now paying $150,000,(J1*) annually to foreign ship owners for carrying trade that ought to be carried in American bottoms. This condition of affairs, Mr. Vest de clared, was "a scandal and disgrace." He said he had been amused at the suggestion of the President made in his message sub mitted yesterday that our carrying trade be encouraged by the payment of subsidies. "In other words," said he. "It is pro posed to substitute for the present vicious system of a navigation law, a scheme of subsidies that is even more vicious than is the evil it proposes to remedy." "Under the proposed policy of the admin istration." continued Mr. Vest, "we are to build a national navy. We are to ecase to be a nation of traders, and under the im pulse of the policy of expansion become a nation of warriors. It would appear to me to be better first to build up our carrying trade. I would also let our people, through the beneficent effects of such trade, buy where they can buy cheapest." Mr. Caffery (La.), also a member of the committee on commerce, opposed the bill. Finally It was made a special order for next Monday. I After the passage of some minor bills the Senate, at 1:80 p.m., on motion of i?fr. Aid rich <R. I.), adjourned. HOI SE OF 

REPRESENTATIVES. The Hall of Representatives looked nor mal when the House was called to order today. The attendance on the floor was large, but the galleries held few spectators. As soon as the journal had been read Mr. Dingley presented, from the ways and means committee, a resolution for the dis tribution of the various topics treated in the President's message to the several com mittees having jurisdiction. It was adopt ed without opposition. Mr. Hay (Va.), a member of the commit tee on military affairs, asked unanimous consent for the consideration of a resolu tion requesting the Secretary of War to inform the He use what towns in the Islands of Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines will require to be garrisoned by soldiers of the United States, and- how many so'.diers will be necessary for each town and how many soldiers will be required for the United States. Mr. Hopkins ?111.) objected, and the reso lution was referred to the committee on military affairs. Deficiency Hill Reported. Mr. Cannon, chairman of the appropria tions committee, reported the deficiency ap propriation bill covering the extraordinary expenses of the army and navy for the six months beginning January 1, 18J>9. The report of the Hawaiian commission transmitted by the President was laid be ; fore the House and referred to the commit tee on territories, together with a bill of I fered by Mr. Hitt to carry out the recom mendations of the commission. Mr. Grosvenor (Ohio) then announced the de.ftih of his late colleague, Mr. Northway of Ohio, during the recess, and Mr. Henry (Miss.) announced the demise during the recess of his colleague, Mr. Love. Appropriate resolutions were adopted, and at 12:25 p.m. the House, as a further mark of respect to their memory, adjourned until tomorrow. 

CAPITAL CENTENNIAL. The President** Reference Sent to the Appropriation* Committee. The ways and means committee today re ferred to the appropriations committee that portion of the President's message relat ing to the proposed centennial celebration of the establishment of the seat of govern ment at Washington.

EXECUTIVE SESSION The War Investigating Committee Sit Be hiud Closed Doors. The Selection of Camp Alger Xot Hade by the Commnniling General. The entire morning session of the war in vestigation commission was spent today behind closed doors. Little could be learn ed of the subjects under consideration, but from the echoes of cachinations which now and then floated out into the ante room the conference was undoubtedly pleasant. It was understood that one of the matters taken up was the setting of the body dur ing the Christmas holidays, and that it had been decided to continue the work steadily with the exception of one or two days. This was due to the fact that the com missioners expect that all testimony will be in by the commencement of the new y?ar, and there is little prospect that the original intention to visit Cuba and Porto Rico will be carried out. The officers in command at both places will be 'examined, it is now believed, in this city. The com ing week will be notable for the witnesses to be heard in regard to the conduct of the war. It Is expected that Secretary Alger. Gen eral Miies, Adjutant General Corbin and General Shatter will be among them. It is understood that the work preliminary in character of outlining the report of the commission has been commenced under General Beaver's direction. The report will be divided in sections showing the manner ! in which the various bureaus of the War Department were conducted, while separate reports will be made as to each branch of the service. Then there w... be a general report devoted to the entire conduct of the war. It will, of course, take a long time after the testimony is concluded to proper ly digest it and prepare the report. Prepwrntloiin for Carlug for tlie Sick. It was developed yesterday afternoon during the examination of Col. Martin, In a colloquial way, that exhaustive prepara tions were being made by the quartermas ter general's office sfor permanent winter headquarters for the sick of the army. Large contracts have been made for lum ber to be sent to Cuba for the use of the medical department, in anticipation of tne necessity for the erection of numerous pavilions for the use of the sick. In this country a 1,000 bed hospital was to be erect ed at Fortress Monroe; a l.?KtO bed hospital at Savannah, a .Kh) bed hospital at San Francisco, while at other places pavilions to accommodate from 100 to 500 patients would be put up. Over at Fort Myer the riding hall had already been converted into a hospital, and other buildings were to be constructed there for similar purposes. Altogether the hos pital capacity, exclusive of the new colo nies, would, when completed, be able to take care of between 5,000 and 0.000 sick soldiers. Another development in Col. Martin's tes timony proved very interesting to the com mission. Some time ago Adjt. Gen. Cor bin submitted to it a statement giving a list of the various camps and the officials who were responsible for their selection. In this list the selection of Camp Alger was attributed to "the commanding gen eral," and the impression was that Gen. Allies had selected the site. In Col. Martin's evidence yesterday he stated that he and Maj. Seaburn had ex amlned the sites; that he had selecte l Camp Alger, and so recommended to the quartermaster general, and that he was thereupon authorized to make the neces sary contracts for its occupancy. At this point Gov. Woodbury remarked: "1 saw Gen. Corbin yesterday, and h ? told me the list he had submitted about the selection of camps would need to be revised." During the executive session this morn ing a messenger was sent over to the War Department to request Col. Hecker to ap pear before the commission at once, but he had not arrived up to 1 o'clock, when re eess was taken. Paymaster General Stan ton was also notified to hold himself in readiness to take the stand. In I'lireutive Seaalon. The commission went Into executive ses sion again at 2 o'clock, and no witnesses appeared. There was an indication of sen timent that certain witnesses w ho had been requested to appear for examination were proving recalcitrant, but this could be traced to no authoritative ource. So far as Colonel Hecker' wag concerned there was no truth In this rumor, as that officer is out of town. Regarding the Christmas holidays, it was decided to adjourn Friday, December 23, and meet again December 20, and to ad journ again December 30 and meet again January 2. All the members of the com mission will spend Christmas at their homes except General McCook and Colonel Denby. THE MEDH'Al. CORPS. Col. I'ornutMl Sent to the Department of California. Col. W. H.

HEADIXU ItOOM FOlt JIVEML.ES. A Xew Feature to Be Added- to the Library of Convrcu. Librarian Young of th# Congressional Library Is adding another popular feature to the library?a reading roam for juveniles. Mr. Young upon several occasions notifed that youthful readers visiting the main reading room were likely to get in the way of their elders, and also likely to have theif little wants made secondary to the demands of the adult readers, sto it occurred to him to set apart a place where children under sixteen years of age can avail themselves of the large collection of books for juveniles in the library. In accordance with this idea a long room | Is being fitted up in the basement adjoining the quarters devoted to the accommodation of the blind and of the Jefferson collection of books. It Is a light and cheery apart ment and will be furnished with rugs, tables and chairs, and two ladles will be placed in charge. There are 10.000 or 12.000 books in the library which ai'e suitable for children's reading, and these will be placed in the room, to be delivered by the attendants. The reading room will be open from !? a.m. until 10 p.m., and-tht^ little visitors welcome to remain and read during good behavior, if they are ill-behaved they will be bundled home to their mothers. No date has been fixed for the opening of the new reading room, but it will be as soon as the furniture can be put in place and the boolu moved. A NEW TERRITORY Form of Government Proposed for Hawaii. BILLS FRAMED BY TBE COMMISSION Report Transmitted to Congress by the President. LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED The President today transmitted to Con gress the report of the Hawaiian commis sion, consisting of Senators Cullom and Morgan, Representative Hitt, President Dole and Justice Frear of Hawaii, together with the text of bills drawn by the com mission for the government of the islands as a portion of the United States. The preliminary portion of the report is mainly descriptive of the Hawaiian Islands, the Inhabitants, the existing institutions, the public domain, productions, climate, har bors? and shipping facilities and various conditions of general interest. The remain ing portion is mainly devoted to a discus- I sion of the legislation proposed by the com- i mission, giving in the appendix the various reports of subcommittees and copies of the i bills suggested. The Territory of Hawaii. Three bills are formulated for the con- ' sideraticn of Congress. The first and prin cipal one outlines a general plan of govern ment and the other two deal with subordi nate questions. Of the main bill the com missioners express the opinion that it will prove to be "such a measure for the gov ernment of Hawaiian Islands as will best promote the interests of their people at the same time that it promotes the interests and mainains the sovereigntv of the peo ple of the United States. ' It provides for the erection of the islands into a territory of the United States to be styled "the territory of Hawaii." The bill contains provisions for the government of the territory, giving it executive, legisla ti\e an 1 judicial officers. A governor, sec retary of the territory, a United States dis trict judge, a 1 nitcd Stales district attor ney and a United States marshal are to be appointed by the President and an internal revenue district and a customs district are created. The offices ?t president, minister of for eign affairs, finance, public instruction, auditor general, deputy auditor general, surveyor general and marshal are al>oI isned. The officers of the territory under the new regime are an attorney general, with powers and duties similar to those now possessed by the attorney general of the republic of Ha.vaii. with a few excep tions: a treasurer, with powers and duties similar to the present minister of finance, "?and such powers and duties regarding li censes. corporations and companies and partnerships and registration of prints, la bels tnd trade-marks as are now possessed by the minister of the interior, except as changed: also a superintendent of public works, a superintendent of public instruc tion. an auditor and a deputy auditor, a surveyor, with the powers and duties of a surveyor general, and a chief sheriff, to succeed to the duties ..f marshal of the re public, all to be appointed by the governor. The (Question of Citizenship. Probably the most important portion of the bill Is section 4, defining citizenship, which provides that "all "white persons, in cluding Portuguese and persons of African descent, and all persons descended from the Hawaiian race, on either the paternal or maternal side, who were citizens of the republic of Hawaii immediately prior to the transfer of the sovereignty thereof to the United States, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States." The LeKiKlaturo. Provision is made for a legislature to consist of two houses, a senate, to consist of fifteen members, as at present, and a house of representatives, consisting of thirty members, double the membership of the house under the Hawaiian republic. The members are to be elected at a general election, to be held on th Tuesday alter the first Monday in November, 1801), and bien nially thereafter. The supreme court is to be the sole judge of the legality of election to a seat in t ither house in case of contest. No member of the legislature is to be eligible for appointment or election to any oflice of the territory, and no officer or em ploye, notary pubiic or agent of the terri tory is to be eligible to election as a legis lator. There is also a provision that no person wTTo, having been entitled to qualify and vote prior to October, 18U7, and since July, ls;?4, failed to register as such voter, shall have a vote, unless he shall take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States. The sessions of the legibla ture are limited to sixty days in duration, and each member is allowed as salary and 10 cents a miie for traveling expenses. A senator is required to be a male citizen of the United States, thirty years of age, to have resided in the territory three years, be the owner in his own right of worth of property, or to have during the preceding year received $1,00?> income. Representatives must be twenty-five years old, male citizens; must have lived three years in Hawaii, and must either own ? worth of property or have an income of $250 a year. <t lift I i tin i ion* of Voters. Voters for representatives are required to be male citizens, twer.ty-one years old, and of one year's residence in the territory; to have registered, to have paid all taxes due the government, and to be "able under standing^ to speak, read and write the English or Hawaiian language."

Speaker Reed and Representatives Hen derson and Dalzell. constituting the repub lican membership of the House committee on rules, which directs the course of legis lation, were together in the Speaker's room today, talking over general plans for the session. There is no purpose to fix "upon any exact program, except to give the ap propriation bills the right of way. Mr. Henderson expressed his personal view thgt there will be little or no general legislation at this session, except, perhaps, some action relating to the permanent peace footing of the army. He says the peace treaty is not likely to be advanced to a stage where the Senate will be called upon to consider any of the questions re lating to our new pe>ssessions.

I In response to a question from Chairman I Hepburn of the committee, Mr. Clements said that the saving in distance between j the White House and Arlington and Fort Myer would be about three miles. Replying | to a question whether Alexandria cotm:y ought to contribute lo the construction f the bridge, Mr. Clements said that This section of Virginia had done its duty in ?aking care of the r.?m*o refugee* wh. wer* dumped by the government upon Alex andria county aft. r the war.

Mr. H<Tider* son urgently represented the necessity of a. bridge across the Potomac, for the use of the government, its weil as the benetit t?f the people. He said the Grand Army posts had recommended the legislation on ac* count of Arlington. Chairman Hepburn suggested That it might be appropriate to construct this bridge in connection with the proposed centennial celebration of the establishment of the government at Washingt<*n Mr. Henderson thought it would be a vjry appropriate occasion. Street Railway Frasrhlte. Mr. Mann, a member of the committee, suggested that street car companies would find the use of the bridge a valuable fran chise. Mr. Henderson said this was undoubtedly true, and that 10 p?r cent on the cost of the bridge could probably be realised from leasing the privilege. Mr. Mann said it might be better to have the railways contribute to the cost of the bridge. Mr. Hume said this would s em to give the railways a partnership with the govern ment in the bridge, and it might be better to lease the franchise.
