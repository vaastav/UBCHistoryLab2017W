Campaign to Increase Tobacco Growing in Sumter County It 'appearing- very doubtful that the money will, ever be forth coming to employ a tobacco demon i strator or to buy seed "for ' free distribution in time to Help out any on the 1523 tobacco crop, and the [time to plant tobacco beds having about, arrived,' the Sumter County Chamber of Commerce has secured 'some seed for free distribution to 'those' farmers who have decided [to produce tobacco for ' the 1923 ^selling "season and who not having j planted tobacco, in 1922; conse quently did not have opportunity to1 save seed from this year's crop. But "the Chamber of Commerce can only ""supply free seed to those who will guarantee to sell their tobacco onu the Sumter tobacco- market in 1923 to either the Cooperative To bacco Growers* 'Marketing Asso ciation or the. Independent ware houses. Just as. long as the Cham ber of-Commerce, can manage to secure seed it will distribute same .as above mentioned to those who .call-in person for the seed. No . 'seed will be snarled to "any one and no attention will be paid to postal card or letter appu'eations. : '.-A ?ri**e to increase ..the acreage i of tobacco in Sumter.. county is be ing made by the Chamber of Com merce which has, been working along, this line . for years. and es pecially within the past thirty days among the farmers of this county. - One especial . feature of this movement b4s. been, the effort to ' disabuse the minds of our.. **es- ' tern Sumter county farmers of the idea that the lands west of Sumter are not suited to tobacco culture. Experience has time . and again proven by the production of as good tobacco as was ever produced ?in the lands west of Sumter and numbers of tobacco buyers and every tobacco warehouseman that has ever done business here state that western Sumter county lands are splendid for first class tobacco production. The mercantile, banking and Other business and ? professional concerns of Sumter and the coun try merchants and large land own ers can greatly assist the Sumter Chamber of Commerce in this movement by trying to get tobac co planted all over Sumter coun ty--'' .? Should, ? tobacco- demonstrator be. employed he should be, put to work now so that. those who are inew at the tobacco planting busi I ness will have some one who can. ] instruct them regarding prepara j ti?n of tobacco beds, and if -this Idemonstrator is put on in time to 1 do this it is" reasonably certain ? that the Chamber of Commerce :can supply this demonstrator with seed for free distribution under certain conditions. Of course a tobacco demonstrator who has had actual experience himself in the production, harvesting, and curing of tobacco and especially in the grading and tieing of tobacco to increase the quality and marketing value will be worth thousands of , dollars to the county in 1923?but the preparation and care of the tobacco beds is the primary effort in successful cultivation of first class tobacco. The Sumter Chamber of Com merce is getting ready for a mon ster celebration early In January or as soon as the approaches to the Wateree River bridge are , thrown open. The object of this celebration is two fold in purpose. First to advertise to the world that "this famous cross country. , and inter-state highway from the north to the south is open and that Sumter is the hub of trans-conti ^nezital automobile transportation, via the Wateree River bridge and Sumter-Columbia hard surfaced highways in Sumter and Richland counties. To show the kind of hard surfaced highways that Sumter and Richland counties are put ting in and will continue to put down for years to come. Second: It is probable that a.; j Sumter business men's, booster trip I will' be run to Eastover and other I eastern Richland county points to put Sumter into closer touch with the hundreds of splendid farmers and their families of those sections. The Columbia Chamber of Com merce has been invited by the Sumter Chamber of Commerce to j join forces in making this, a dual j county celebration with our friends and neighbors of Richland, Or angeburg and j Calhoun. counties j joining in with Sumter county cit izens in celebrating the bridging of an heretofore impassable barrier) between Sumter and the Pee Dee I counties and numbers of Carolina 'counties just across the river. Just what shape this big event will take, when and at what point it will be held will have to be fig ured out by the commercial organ izations of Columbia and Sumter. jand it is sincerely hoped that the I Rotary and Kiwanis clubs, auto I mobile associations, and other civic l and business organizations of both j of these cities and the Young Men's j Business Deague of Sumter will interest their organizations in j thinking up something worth while, j The picture of this celebration isj j gradually shaping itself up in the j Sumter Chamber of Commerce and j sketches thereof being sent over to I Columbia for inspection and in-1 j spiration. I Babe Ruth, former baseball play- i I er, says he likes farming.

Commissioner Booth called at tention to; complaint received from Mr. Curry on the Mayesville. road in regard to condition of ditches. Engineers advised th?y would im mediately look into this matter. C?tnmissip^er Britton ? stated he would like a full discussion of the force account proposition. This was gone into very fully, and.it was decided that it was to the best in-[ terests of the commission to letf the engineers handle this force ac count matter as they have, been doing.: Agreement between the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad company and the Sumter County Permanent Road Commission in regard, to erec-. tion of overhead bridge at Swifton: Siding, prepared by Atlantic'Coast Line Railroad company and ' sub mitted by them for execution, was read very carefully and con sidered;- it was found entirely in accordance with the commission's agreement and was properly exe cuted.

' Matter of straightening the Shi loh road through Brunson lands at a point where it crosses the Bre% ington road was discussed. Engi neer's location, which is opposed by" the owner, was approved by the board, and it was decided to insti tute, condemnation proceedings to secure necessary rights of way. Engineer Murray brought to] board's. attention the matter of j maintenance of roads, explaining] that the sum of $13,921.82 iSj available from State Highway" De-! partment for 1922 automobile li-j cense charges. The question of best method to employ in handling this maintenance proposition was' discussed at length, and on motion of Commissioner Burrows, duly sec onded, it was ordered that the board's standing committee, com posed ' of Commissioners Jennings, Lemmon and Booth, confer with Lee, Pennell, Murray & Company, engineers, work out a plan for this maintenance proposition, and sub mit it to the board at next meeting. Chairman Jennings read letter from Southern Bell Telephone com pany in regard to replacement of polls on the Pinewood road, and secretary was instructed to reply thereto. Location of Sumter-Camden road between Little Rafting Creek ^and Remberts was brought up for dis cussion. Mr. Gillis, one of the own-, ers through whose property the new location .passes had requested certain changes in the alignment, but after a full discussion the com mission decided to adhere to the original location. Commissioner Burrows advised the board it was his opinion this was. the logical time to award con tracts for the extension of the Bishop vi lie road from B oss?r d Cross Roads to DuBose Cross Roads at the Lee County line; and also from Bossard's Cross Roads to Du Bose Siding. Matter was fully dis cussed and vote taken, with the result it was decided to award these contracts to C. D. Rigsbee, Dur ham, N. C. who is building section "B" of the Bishopville road, at the same unit prices which he is receiving under his present con tract for section "B" Bishopville road. Commissioner Booth dissented, stating in his opinion the road be tween the swamp and DuBose Cross Roads was in good condition and, did not need paving at this time. On motion of Commissioner Rembert, seconded by Commis sioner Burrows, it was decided to award to Mallard Lumber Company a contract for grading approxi mately two miles?from Moore's Avenue at Dalzell. to present grad ed new road at Ballard's Hill, so ordered. Commissioner Rembert suggested that this road be straight ened as much as possible. Messrs. D. W. Cuttino. S. F. and D. E. Stoudenmire appeared before the board in regard to a strip of land reported sold by Mr. H. J. Harby to Mr. Cubbage, on the road to Myers* Store, stating this little piece of land completely blocked them from reaching hard surfaced road. Commission advised these gentlemen they had no jurisdiction over this matter and suggested they rake it up with the County Board of Com missioners; that they were in sympathy with their complaint. Engineers explained' that the old public road could be kept open by the installation of a pipe line over a large ditch on the right, which would give these gentlemen access, to and from their property. Boart instructed 'the* engineers to have] this pipe .installed mmedlately. PaxrUte Road. Two delegations ? from' the Pp calo-Tindkl-Pinewood sections \ ap-j peared before the board. Mr. M. H.

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS Educational Addresses Made By Several Church Leaders ; Rev. A. G. Townsend. district superintendent of the Sumter dis trict, presided at the night session. The services opened with an an them by the choir. Prayer by Rev. Shelton, after which another very beautiful selection, Hark. Hark, My Soul, was rendered by the choir. Dr. Shelton was introduced and said that he came to bring a mes sage, from the church that every body who was willing to work for it could secure an education. Fac tory life, drove him from the in fluences which gave .him a desire for an education but through the influence of a Christian minister he received this message from the board of education and he would emphasize three things: Industry, a willingness to work and appli cation. He said it was his privilege to study the life of Booker T. Washington with a class of young men. He asked -them what had they learned from that study and he said the most capable among them replied. They found out that they would have to work harder after they had succeeded than they had before. There is no greater stimulus than the Christian j religion. He. gave a. good text for in educational sermon, "Nurse the child and I'll give thee wages." Dr. J." W.. Bowen was introduced and said "Give us the young and we will make a new civilization in one generation." He told, a story of an African tribe who though j small hi numbers got it into their naind/that they wanted to conquer | a,.nation. Their prince began, with, these Zulu babies to train 'them and by the time they were grown tSey were trained and gave 'many nations much trouble and they were never conquered. He made 5^. new nation in one generation, this has been done and can be ?bhe again. The biggest job America has is to train the weaker races. If she would do this, she would jump up. If she would put the price of a single battleship in ther training of the black race. The training of the negro membership af the Methodist Episcopal church is the church's biggest job. Money cannot be better, spent than in training negro boys and girls. They must be educated and trained to be able to fully appreciate what is be ing done. Dr. Wade, secretary of the board of conservation was introduced and said he would have his say on Fri day. Then he-would practically illustrate the Christian education t)f the church. ;, Prof. Henry Pierson, dean of Ch?flin said that Claflin believes in the education, of the child 40 years before it is born, and what is giv en in' money to Claflin, we will give it back" in manhood and woman hood, for Clafln believes in the highest development possible. Claf lin quartette sang very sweetly, ac companied by Prof. Hunt, instruc-j tor of music at Clafln. ' j President J. B. Randolph of Claflin was introduced and "came to the front amid cheers. He said, "I came to this great conference that I have heard so much about to bring greetings and thanks in my humble way for the privilege of rendering service to you. I sin cerely thank you for this oppor tunity. In the Texas conference when we have done our best, South Carolina still keeps ahead. She ought to, she is old enough. It is 118 years old: it is worth being proud of. Every negro should be proud of its history. Yes, we 3hould be proud of a conference where more than 170 answered to roll call the first morning. I want to congratulate you because not withstanding you had the burden of building up the church, and the Sunday schools, you did not forget the educational cause. I am hap py to come into your ranks to add my feeble bit to assist in this good work for the uplift of humanity in any way that I can. I realize that Claflin is wrapped up in your en tire life. It has your love and like real lovers you are jealous of tier, and you have a right to be inxious about her welfare as far as my own ability is concerned. I tremble when I look at her record. [ do not come as Dr. Dunton's suc cessor. I am not worthy of such isperation. but I feel confident with Sod's help and the South Carolina conference behind me that you will lift me up and push so that the ivork is bound to succeed. t-I like Dr. and Mrs. Dunton, am willing to give all that is within me to the building up of this great institution, (t has been said here that the work Lo elevate one people has many iandicaps and a note of dtscour igement once and a while is at :ended. Very different to our past -eputation as a people who in form er years wrestled and waited pa tently on God. We must still continue our fatih in God for if mything at all is worth while it is Christian education. He spoke of a beautiful poem by Mrs. Johnson, he title of which CT Can't let you n") suggest the sentiment encir cled, illustrates the feeling of a irery cultured negro woman the iuthor on account of the situation confronting the negro child of to lay. Some wonder if it were bet er that they were not born. The >nly hope we have for these and >ther similar conditions is Christian education. Let us, as has been said >y a previous speaker "Nurture the hild and I will pay you wages." !t is our earnest prayer that the rreat M. E. church will do this. Dr. King, one of the foremost ora :ors among the younger men that ve have, he bids fair to excel some >f our grand old orators of the oast. He is logical, eloquent, prac ical and thoughtful, and any jhurch might be proud of such a >roduct. Dr. King: said by way of ntroductipn that he used to have me sermon and many toxts. but low he has one text ;ind one ser V mon. And that Is the South Wes tern Christian Advocate. We re gret that we can give only a very incomplete outline of Dr. King's remarks. He said that the Meth odist Episcopal church had popu lized and democratized Christian education. This he proved most successfully. He believed that the negro should not only be trained to work but they should be trained how to work., and to be trained how to do, both barwn and brain, must be trained and developed that they might pull together. The thing that brought success and made the Methodist Episcopal church superior in her educational work was the phychological prin ciple that she recognized the ne gro a man, not a white man, a black man, a red man, no simply a man. The meeting was indeed a great one. Many prominent educators were present and the church was taxed to its^ fullest capacity. December 8th at 10:30 through the kindness of the Second Pres byterian church the Laymen's As sociation met and held a splendid meeting. Some prominent laymen attending were, President N. A. Cornell, who gave a very enthusias tic talk. Hon. E. J. Sawyer, Dr. J. S. Levy, Rev. A. . J. Andrews, Rev. S. J. McDonald^ C. Wr. Cald well and.many others of the laity. F. W. Anthony?

HARWNG'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS President Takes Up Transportation Sit uation, Prohibition Enforcement and Farm Credits Washington, Dec. 8.?Presi dent Harding addressing, congress in person today, on the state of the union, placed the transportation situation, prohibition enforcement and farm credits in the forefront of the national problems pressing for solution. Also he took occasion to reply directly to those whom he said had assumed that the United States had taken itself "aloof and apart, unmindful of world obligations." He declared these gave "scant cred it" for the "helpful part" Ameri ca had assumed in international relations, referring particularly to the arms conference. Of the prohibition situation the j executive asserted there were con ditions of' enforcement "which sa-j vor of nationwide scandal." He made' no recommendations on this score but announced his purpose! to qaU an early conference of the governors of the states and terri- j tories with the federal ?uthori- j ties to formulate definite policies of I national and state cooperation in the administering of the laws. Declaring there was no prob- i lem exceeding in importance the \ one of transportation, Mr. Hard-j ing told congress there was need to begin on plans to coordinate all I transportation facilities?rail, wa- J ter and motor. As to the relief of j the railroad problem he suggested | merger of lines into systems, a,fa- j cilitated interchange of freight! cars and a consolidation of fa cilities generally. Turning to the recent railroad strike, the president proposed that the federal tribunal dealing with disputes between the carriers and their workers be given ample au thority to enforce its decisions. He voiced a preference for abolition of I the railroad labor board and the j placing of its functions under an enlarged interstate commerce com- ( mission. Should the decision be to continue this board in exist ence, however, he suggested that the partisan membership be abol ished to the end that the tribunal be impartial and the headquarters moved -from Chicago to Washing ton so there might, be direct con tact with the commission. The only specific recommendaT tion of the executive for enact ment of legislation, at this, the J short session of congress, related to the permanent establishment of widened farm credits. He .both advocated ample farm production credits and enlarged land credits through* enlargement of the pow ers of the farm loan board and reminded congress that special pro vision must be made for live stock production credits. ? Other recommendations includ ed: , Registration of aliens. More' rigid examinations of im migrants at embarkation points. Federal assistance in the educa tion of aliens. ? A constitutional amendment giv ing congress authority over child labor.
