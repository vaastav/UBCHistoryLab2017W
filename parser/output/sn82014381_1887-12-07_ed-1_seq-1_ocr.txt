Matters of Importance Acted ITpou l>y the State Board or Trade. Han Kka.ncisco, December 6th.— The Board met in regular weekly session at its Second-stree; rooms this afternoon, Presi dent A. T. Hatch of Suisun presiding. The news of the affiliation of i'lacer county was received with pleasure, and an nouncement was made of the organization of a Hoard of Trade in Woodland for Yolo county. A communication from Local Agent Shepherd of the Chicago and Alton line caused some debate. He asked for pamphlets and general literature regarding California, volunteering to distribute widely in Illi nois and Missouri. W. H. Mills questioned the advantage of indiscriminate advertising, and suggested that it be ascertained exactly how the pro posed distribution was to be effected. M. M. Kstee of Napa agreed with Mr. Mills, and cited how the Xapa circulars, with pretty pictures upon them, had been greedily taken at the Mechanics' Pair, yet probably not more than one in fifty of these books had been read. Now is the time, it was suggested, for the circulation of semi tropical, orange and lemon literature in the frigid districts of the East. Secretary Davies suggested that one in • luiry that came to him recently was : "Where is the best town for a winter resi dence?'' The labor of answering such a question, it was thought, would be consid erable. Mr. Estee offered a resolution authoriz ing the compilation by a committee of facts and figures regarding "payment for skilled and unskilled labor and chances for em ployment in the State. Mr. Mills spoke on this resolution, say ing that with the growing fruit production of the State, the labor problem is one of the most important to be solved. There is no labor for the ranch better than that of the industrious white boy. We want to circulate information that will tell the yonng men in the Kast the facts regarding this State. The speaker detailed at length the difficulty Senator Stanford had en countered in securing good labor for the Vina ranch .luring this year's harvest. In the discussion that followed Mr Hatch said that so far from there being a surplus of labor that if this year he had had $3,1 XX i more labor he would have cleared $10. OW more than he did. Mr. Kstee said that he had found from inquiry and experiment that a family in California may live fully o3J per "cent cheaper than in any other State in the union. Mr. Blowers suggested that young women may secure profitable employment here in gathering the fruit harvest as well as young men. He employed some twenty live young women this season in picking and packing grapes. The resolution of Mr. Kstee was adopted and as the Committee on Labor Statistics the Chair appointed Messrs. Kstee, Mills and Camron. The question of making an exhibition in Los Angeles of Upper California pro ductions, brought up by Mr. Bartlett, of I.ivermore, was discussed. It was yaid that at this time of the year no suitable exhibi tion could be arranged, so the proposition was withdrawn. Jt was decided by resolution to denounce generally as frauds all gift enterprises of the East which promised lots in California for nothing. One started in Minneapolis was cited as an instance of the way sp< en la'ors are making money out of California's growing fame. HE HLOAVS WELL.

San Francisco, December Oth. — This afternoon Judge Hornblower disposed of the case of Seneca Augustus Swahn, charged with having forged the name of Dr. Jt. il. McDonald to five certificates of Central i'a citic siock, by holding him to answer. San- Pbah( tsco, December (ith.— ln hold ingSwalm to answer for the McDonald forgeries to-day, Judge Hornblower thus expressed himself: " In the examination of ihis cate the evidence has developed such ;i state ot immorality and crini?, con sisting of adultery, perjury, larceny and forgery, as is seldom brought to the judicial pori em an examination.

Washington, December Gth.— Soon after the opeuing of the Senate that body took a recess to await the coming of the Presi dent s message. At five minutes past I MoOook, Secretary of the .Senate, began reading the message. He concluded at 1:30 ami the Senate ad journed.

TRESS OPINIONS. Eastern CrltUisius on President Cleve- land's "One-Idea" Message. [Ctfgrijd, I.SS7, by t/it California Associated Prm.] Nsw York, December Oth.— The Com mercial Adeertuer, speaking of the Presi dent's message, says : The novelty in form and the unconventional tone of the message, as well as the urgent and over >hadowing importance of the single topic it considers, will attract the universal at tention of the nation to the document. If we are not mistaken, it will have decisive weight in the future of parties and of !e<- islation. The Pott says^ editorially: The message deals with nothing but public finances and a means of bringing about an equilibrium between receipts and expenditures. This is unusual, but under the circumstances entirely wise. The World in an editorial says : In thus pressing upon Congress an issue of para mount importance, to the exclusion of all other issues, the President has shown a true csmprehension of the situation. lie has championed the cause of the long over burdened tax-payers, and he has supplied his party with what it has long lacked— an issue aiid a leader. A REPfBLIIAN 

JOUBHAL'S VTEWB. The Mail and £ipr<M says: The Presi dent has framed the issue for next year's campaign. He lias put the Democratic party on a free trade platform, and the country will recognize the fitness of thepo- Sltion. The devotion of tlie whole of the message to the single subject was necessary to emphasize the fact that Cleveland is a candidate for re-election as a free trade leader. The Republican party lias nothing to complain of. It has for several years urged the making (if the issue, and Cleve land has simply accepted the invitation of his political opponems. We are glad that he has accepted it so frankly, bo fully and bo boldly. There ia promise of a great po litical contest in the unequivocal words of tins extraordinary message. The Repub licans will enter upon the campaign with courage and confidence' There is no doubt about their attitude oa the tarill question. They took their ground years ago, and are prepared to maintain it now. ThePresi dentand Speaker Carlisle say that they de sire to do nothing that will injure the American workingmen or Americ-m man ufacturers, but neither the workingmen nor manufacturers will he deceived by flit tering generalities. They know that free trailers believe that both would be benefited by the abolition of duiies. No such false issue will be fought over. The next cam paign will be a battle between protection and free trade, and it will be a wholesome, vigorous political contest, with the chances largely in favor of the Republicans. RKMAUKAIiLE KOR ITS OMISSIONS Ni.w York, December 7th.— a. X.— This morning's Tribune says the President's message was a disappointment to Wall S(m;t. Ithad been supposed that ii would treat of other matters than i he tariff", and would make positive recommendations on several subjects. The genera! opinion seemed to be that the mi Bsage was remark able chiefly by its neglect of important ob jects outside the tariff. In this respect the free-trade utterances of the message were not entirely offset by the concluding state ment that "the question oi free-trade is absolutely irrelevant." THE 

DKHOCRATIO KEY-XOTK. Cleveland's One-Idea Message -How It Is Keg»rded East. i Copyright, 1887, by the California Associai, -I J V. ,.- | Washington, December (jth.— The Presi- Jentsent to Congress today his annual message. It is a unique document, much Shorter than any similar paper prepared by any Presiuent during the past quarter of a century, and dealing simply with the ques tion of revision of the tari'tr and reduction of the surplus. It is considered by mem bers of both parties here as fixing the j Democratic position in the nest Presiden : tial campaign, laying down the lines on j which the battle of 1888 will be fou»ht. ! The President made no allusion to the fish ] cries, the silver question, national banks j pensions, nor any one of the minor propo j sitions that divide the two parties. The ! tariil' is made the single and prominent , feature of the session's work. I The contrast between the tone of Car : lisle's speech yesterday and the President's message is the subject of universal com ment and speculation. Carlisle, who was supposed to be the more earnest revenue reformer of the two, is moderate in his ut terance compared with the President. The message pleased the great majority lof the Democrats. Speaker Carlisle says I he sees nothing in it to prevent a recon struction of the Rajidall wing of the party. ■ Kandail declines to be interviewed on the j subject. 

SENATOR RAOTOBD'S OPINION. Senator Stanford says he think- the message is a fair statement of the Presi dents position on the tariff question. " I want to see the internal revenue tax abol- I tahed," said the Senator to your correspond ent to-night, " and I observe that Mr. Cleve land wishes revenues reduced by taking the duties off imports. I can see no reason for taxing any article of legitimate manufact ure and removing taxea from articles of foreign manufacture. It is as legitimate to make whisky from com as to manulacture I flour from wheat. It is not the use, but the I abuse, of whisky that is reprehensible, and there is the power in the Federal and State Governments to control its manufacture, if the tax is abolished. 1 don't think the President's view will be popular in Califor nia." 

WHAT SENATOR HEABST SAYB. Senator Hearst said : " Well, I haven't read the message, aud I did not listen at tentively to the reading, bu: it seems to be popular with our side, and I guess it will be all right." OCB CONGRESSMEN HAVE OPINIONS. Representative McKenna said: "The message is a very queer document, and in myjudgment. weak. Yesterday the Speaker told the country that we were going to the bow-wows, and today the President sayg I weare on the vergeoi financial ruin. J may be BOCOBMUmiy short sighted, but f can see no sign of the widespread ruin and de vastation that the President says threatens us." Representative Felton said: "The Presi dent assumes certain propositions to be facts, and from them draws his personal conclusions. They are not conclusive to me, by any means. I think the message, as a whole, is weak, and a good campaign document for the Republicans to meet on the stump.' 1 Mr. Biggs said: "I think the message is a good one. It defines our position on the tariff concisely and emphatically. 1 don't like what the President had to say about wool. We raise a great many sheep in California, but with that exception I think the message a good one." Mr. Morrow said: '-The messase abounds simply in generalities. It con tains no specitic recommendations for tariff revision. As a Democratic tariff speech delivered on the stump in the campaign, it would be admirable.

JVSTICK. Xo Objection to berried to the Appoint ment of Inmii I Copyright, 1567, by Uue California Associated rras.] Washington, Dec -mber fith.— There will be no serious opposition in the Senate to the confirmation ot Secretary Lamar as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. The only objection that can be urged against him, apart from the fact that he is a stanch friend of Jeff Davis, is that he is H2 years of age. A Justice of the Supreme Court can be retired at the ace of 70. pro vided he has served ten years, and Lamar, cannot be retired, even at his o-.vn request^ unless he becomes 72 years old. Lamar is the first Democrat appointed a member of the Supreme Court since Abraham Lincoln made Stephen J. Field a member of that tribunal. The Mississip pian is in good bodily health, and his men tal faculties are unimpaired. He has not practiced the profession of law for many years, but he is an educated jurist, and will be welcomed to the bench by members of the Court with all the respect due men of Bne legal attainments. Justice Gray, of Massachusetts, who was appointed by President Arthur, never practiced law, but was educated a jurist.

Dickinson claims that Smith lias been working against him. .Smith is a Republican, and a Democratic House needs one of their par;y in his place. Smith is credited to Michigan, and the deal was fixed up some days ago.

COST OF THE ARMY. The Secretary of War Wants •53,338,710 For Next Year. Washington, December tith.— The an nual report of the .Secretary of War shows the expenditures oi that department dur ing the fiscal year to amount to $41,386,165.
