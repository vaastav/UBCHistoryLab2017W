His exhibitions will be more beautiful and Btartling than anything ever seen in thin city. Both tho lovers of soi ence and the general public will be in- j structed nnd delighted. The General Assembly of the State convenes at tho Capitol to-morrow. Should j the message of the Governor be sent in at an early hour, we shall endeavor to give t tho full text of it in our next edition. The t members have already arrived in consider- I ablo numbers, and the prospect is that ; thero will be a full quorum in attendance at the opening hour. i It is to be hoped tha. tlie financial ques- ' tion, tho legal rate of interest, a general , railroad law, proper measures of relief for \ our people, matters of internal improve ment, our educational interests, immigra- 1 tion, agriculture, etc., will receive their ' proper consideration at the hands of this J body. One year's experience at legisla- j tion ought to enable them to become an t efficient working body for this session. '■ ._ j RICHMOND TO W.tSlllVilll.. Lnnd—Water-powers—Pepnlatlon—Railroads j —Petersburg—Farmers' Convention. [From our Special Correspondent.] Washington, Dec. 2,1872. J Having attended the Farmers' Convert- - tion at Petersburg, last week, and listened < thoughtfully to its debates and proposi- ( tions, we are satisfied good will grow out l of its organization and doings, though it is • not what and all that we expected from the • call or announcement. It was not suffl < ciently attended or managed by practical , farmers ; yet, several important topics, in- - teresting to them, were proposed and dis- , cussed. And the agitation there started ( will be considered and examined by farmers at home and in their local clubs and meet ings, such as fertilizers, homesteads, immi- t gration, a general railroad law, and other topics ; and thus the agricultural class will become better prepared to discuss and act t upon them wisely and independently at a ) future meeting that may be held, we nope, £ ere long. c We found Petersburg, where the Con- | vent'on was held, a pleasant, active, and . hospitable place, containing many most in- - telligent and enterprising gentlemen ; while , many are too much wedded to traditional | ideas and old fogy notions, out of which ' the rising generation will gradually grow _ and ripen. YVc passed from Richmond to Freder icksburg, on the Rappahannock river, in . the cars of the Richmond and Fredericks burg railroad, and were gratified to observe signß of improvement along the line, and also to learn that its freight and travel is ■ on the increase, which is a promising omen for the couutry of its prosperity. There is much good land along the route, which should have good cultivators, and a ( good deal which ought to bo better culti vated. The number of population ought to be greatly increased, so as to present an industrious, enterprising farmer on every two or three hundred acres; then they could ! have plenty of good roads, schools and churches, with blooming fields and cheer ful homes. The grand water-powers should be improved on the Rappahannock and other streams. . On tho cars we found the conductors obliging and gentlemanly, which was gen erally remarked, and particularly our courteous friend, M. A. Birdsong, was spoken of for his kindly attention to the comfort of his passengers. At Quantico we left the cars and went l . on board the fine boat " Keyport," Cap- - tain Carter, on which we had a coraforta- ! bio passage to YVashington, though encoun tering considerable ice between Alexandria and tlio capital. Immigration—more labor, enterprise and ! capital—to work the vast, beautiful, friendly , but waste lands—which meet the eye of tho traveller, is greatly needed all over this State; and among the means, most effectual to bring them here, is for the j farmers to cultivate their fields well and ■ deeply—so as to produce large yield of crops,to show the capacity of the lands, and , thereby recommend them, which will in- , duce purchasers. Large yields on the fields, and low prices for the surplus lands, is what will, more than anything else, se cure immigration to Virginia; and next, fair and liberal representation and adver tising through the papers, to be sent North and East, will do the business ; but work, earnest industry, by those already here, in producing good crops, will do more than anything else. General Fit. Hugh Lee hit the keynote when ho said, "Industry, economy, closo farming, thorough tillage of small fields, rather than skimming large ones" is tha true policy. That course will show results far more in viting than flaming advertisements or high . sounding resolutions. Then let these sub stantial facts be well known abroad, and it will not be long ere substantial and indus trious buyers will flock hero from abroad to buy farms.

He mado interesting ex periments with oxygen and hydrogen gasses, with the compound blow-pipo with its beautiful scintillations of burning steel , and with tho calcium light, electric light ana lantern, showing photographs of microsco- , pical object.. The most beautiful object shown, per haps, was the image of the carbon points. The Professor closed with tho exhibition of ' a large electro-magnet, suspending four men in the air, and afterwards all the boys that could hold on to tho amature. These ( feats well illustrated its magnetizing power, i A bar of steel was magnetized, to which was suspended a whole bucket of nails. The hall wa3 crowded full of eager searchers after knowledge. The scholars were remarkably attentive. So excellent was their behavior that Professor Binford, ! Superintendent of Public Schools, publicly thanked and complimented them.
