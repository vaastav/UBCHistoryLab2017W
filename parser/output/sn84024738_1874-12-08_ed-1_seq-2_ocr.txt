J9PAIN. i Tbe .President bad hoped &. at by t&e meetiDg of Congress negotialioae with Spase wonld be concluded. He therefor:: says littie about indemnity pendiDg negotiaSione, i FUjAJtflAL. ThePrcsident recommends .resumption at tbe earliest practicable day, but does u?ot be lieve tbat tbis can be as early as ilie 1st of January, 1??6. "Without naming .* da.?, be thinks it tbe duly of Congress to do^o. He advises tbe repeal of the .legal-tendc; cU.Wfie of the currency act, and iKges tbat the Sec ro tary of tbe Treasury be ecipower^d to bay gold, from and after the.day, fixed fo? i&e re sumption, by the issuance of bonds. As a contemporary measure of assistance, he ad vises tbat the receipts of Government shculd be in excess of expenditures ia order to cup port resumption. Economy, *in all depart ments is pressed as proper on the occasion, and, if necessary, increased duties on imposts is advised. [Pretty good "fcard-moue$T " policy.] 

FRZE RANKING. The President thinks that with <tbe retort of specie payments banking should be free. Billbolders should be protected^ in the present-banking law; Jbut there Should be no limitation to tbe currency. Tb^-oommu nity itself should determine what amount is required for business, instead of leaving it to the Executive, Secretary of tha Treasury, and Congress. Regulation^ however, should be provided -suited to the resumption spe cie payments for tbe government of t&nks. The President recommends tbat Congress shall not interfere with the currency .act passed last wintec. 

JNT&RN'AL IM?ROVKKJJB?TS. The President abftains from .making auy recommendations with regard to interna! improvements by the General {government. He refers to the documents brought out by the investigations of committees ?jd the sur veys of engineers in relation io several routes. Some of these accompany ithe mes sage. LOKi&UNA AND /3KANSA8. The President recountstbc occurrences in Arkansas, and gives the reasons Cor his declining to interfere in tbe recent .diffi culties in tbat State. l$e recurs to the factB recited in his message of Feb ruary, 18T3 in regard to Louisiana? bit submission of the whole question to Con gress, and his informing that bady that in default of aetion by & on the aybjcct he should act according to tke dictates of his own judgment, recognizing thegovernmeat which was recognized and upheld by the eocirts of the State ? i. e.t the Kmj-qg# government. Tbe President again tobmits th? question to Congress, and assures tbem that be will con tinue to act as be has beretofo&s done unless controlled by Congress. [But is there aDy necessity for this acting at all f] THfl JKWAKg. General Quant renews bis rseemmeuda tlon of tbe peace policy [too late for Captain Jack], and thinks ir that policy be maintained .It will soon end troubles on tbe border. (But the guns which ended Captain Jack's life were not Quaker guns.] 

C1V1L-SEBV1CB REFORM. The message claims benefits from civil service reform? tbat it has elevated the ca pacity and tone of appointments, &ct; bu> it Is impossible to continue tbis reform with out the direct support of Congress. [We shoukl think so. And tbat direct support can never be bad.] HEADS OF MFARTMSMTS. IiK mo wencU tliat rcpoxti of the heads of I>ej)artnumta to |li? cowjideni tiou of Congress.

We suppose Mr. MaoKimkov, in tbe words f admitted indebtedness/* >ta<3 allusion to the assumption of u two-thirds'" of the debt .as-provided in the funding ?3f. , If so, we were in orror in assuming that tbe bondholders' propositions equally in ? voiced the payment of .interest with the funding act. It would'then appear? i 1st. That the reso!ution?of the Bondbold' era? Convention involved only the payment oC.four per cent, at preseiit, while the funding ?act; provided for six per cent. flFke bondhold ers .would postpone tbe ?re?aining fwo per cent? for ten years, the Stote.payiog it earlier at her option ; but if not paid by the time spe* cifled then to be" funded in aTour per cent, interest-bearing bond., k. , .2nd. Mr. MacKinnon proposes to " re capitalise " the " admitted indebtedness " (is that Uvo-thirds ?) in a<four per cent, in terest-bearing bond. That wonld diminish 'tbe interest on so mnch <of .the State debt from six to Jour pet sent. <Thi> we suppose to be a .correct view of ?the* plans. How far either alternative to the iftiBdring.aet can be enacted dnto law, or to .what extent the holders of bends under the tfua^vng law <will acqaiesce in any change of ttbe.fortn or amount of Interest to be paid (omtfaeijtate bonds tbey hold, remains to be aeon. The settlement of the .ftuostion must heooe of great difficulty.
