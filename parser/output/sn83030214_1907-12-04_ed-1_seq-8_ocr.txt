After talking for an hour en "The Jews In Amer ica" before the People's Institute, in Cooper Union, last nipht. Professor Franklin H. Giddings, of Columbia University, was plied with questions f<.r nother hour by an audience largely composed of Jews. •Is the Jew justified in his position in tlie move ment to keep out Christian ceremonies from the pabttc schools?" he was asked. Professor Giddings answered: i vnainly. Any movement Is justified in the United States The Question involves two queries: 1 -irs.. whether it Is right and expedient that a niovem<*iit aeainst Christmas festivities in the public schools should b<' pushed forward, and second, what my altitude personally Is. If we can't have free-speech ;m<l if a group of men cannot K-t together to aßi tate a dfslred end. we have not yet achieved Ameri can civilization, and we. had better keep on trying. Tn the other place. I do not see how any on.- can subscribe to th<: doctrine that It is right to tax one group of citizens for a general purpose, and compel them uiidt-r the Uiw to BUtnnlt to things thai are <on*rarv*to thHr ronscienop. I believe In universal Mtwrtv *an<l we ought to ha.vo exercises that ar- ac rpptabl*; to all common sense men and l>> no other*. I think that the movement Is right and prop.-, and Its success will depend upon the prood Judgment temperate tone and patience with which it is carrie-l on. If Ii Is carried on properly it will be a loceHß, In answer to Other questions Professor Giddings said that be did not' think tho Zionist movement would prevail, for the reason that tho attraction and opportunities offered by other countries were far greater than would bo offered the Jew in a land of his own. „ . , "The Jew has come to America to stay, said. Professor Giddingx. "and he will have all tho kinds of liberty h- wants if he makes known his wants to the American people. Whatever else may come to pass we shall certainly have Kttgtoua liberty In this country." i • SUNDAY ''LTD" ON IN CLEVELAND. Mayor Johnson's Change In Policy on Sa loons Creates Discussion.
