A Ions, anxious dav of seeming infe ction on the part of those whose office it is to choose an inaugural committee chairman with feverish activities on the part of those who would be chosen to that honorable position, had brought the campaign for the place at midnight to an intensity never hitherto knots n in similar competition and had undoubted ly clouded the prospect for an early ap pointment. Senator Ken) on said that the country had a right to look to Washington for a model cits, not onb in civic affairs but also to set a. high moral standard to the ret of the countr) The bill, which mil hae a hearing this morning lefore the District Committee of the benate. is entitled the Ken) on Red Light Injunction Mil fe 5i61 Hill la Indorsed Resolutions were adopted indorsing the Kenjon red light' law, the Johnston fcundav rest law for the District, the Jones Works acts for increased restric tion of the liquor traffic and to petition Congress for the maintenance of the divorce law requiring Scripture grounds for remarriage In divorce cases.

National committeemen arid Congress men have expressed verv ardent opinions At midnight perhaps the most nearly conclusive statement that could be made outside Mr McCombs coterie of con fidants was that Mr Jordan still seemed to have the best chances In circumstances distinctly unsettled Of the "dark horses' Corcoran Thorn, George F Schutt, Ben Minor, and E.
