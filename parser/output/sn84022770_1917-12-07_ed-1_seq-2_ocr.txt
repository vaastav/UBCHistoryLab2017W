PAGE TWO Washington Standard OLYMPIa, WASHINGTON BAGLE FRESHWATEK Edito Member of the WASHINGTON STATE PRESS ASSOCIATION Snbarrlptloa Price. IISO » U«r STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER. Bold, forceful anil aggressive from its tirst sen tence to the last. President Wilson's message to Congress is a clarion call to the members of that body and to the people of the nation at large to fell heartily to the task at hand, the immediate end great task of winning the war, and to-do it without any misgivings or trumped-up notions as to their own prospects and desires. Likewise it is just as forceful a message to our Allies and the world at large, a message which clearly sets forth to the Central powers, the neutrals and ourselves, just what we are fighting for and how we propose to settle the world tragedy when it is settled. There is nothing hesitating, nothing vague, nothing covered up in it all. The president boldly And repeatedly says that "autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claim to power or leadership in the modern world," and in the next breath he specifies as the indication of its going the time "when the people of Germany say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done." Anybody permitted to read hki address can understand what he means. There is nothing Ambiguous about it; rather is there a repetition of these two ultimates, pointedly stated at the outset, running through the whole of it. There lore it will be interesting to note its reception— and its effeet —among the peoples of the Central empires, if they are permitted to read it. For in these words the president has declared the basis upon which the Allies will make peace, for the United States today is dictating, as it has been for the past ten months, the policies of the Allies, 'in striking contrast are these statements to. the vague, indefinite, double-meaning offers Which Germany has made in the past in proffering / peace, offers whose meaning and possibilities de pended entirely upon the person expounding or * interpreting. The president's message is strikingly charac teristic of American action, straight from the shoulder, plainly and emphatically summing up what he has said in all of his public addresses since last spring in which any reference was made to the war, into two concrete, unescapably speci fied propositions. A 

UNITED If ATION. One of the most forceful paragraphs in the president's whole address is his reference to the domestic situation and his declaration that "as a nation we are united in spirit and intention." The same boldness with which he attacked the international situation and the same frankness with which he declared its objectives, are evident here. There is no mincing of words, no handling of soft and lovely, soothing phrases. "I pay little heed to those who tell me other wise," he says. "I hear the voices of dissent— who does nott I hear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling themselves in Impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I "I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits.. But I know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten." So he leads forth for the nation, thrusting aside the few self-seekers who may be in the way with out showing even the slightest favor or desire for compromise, and aggressively championing and heartening the loyalty of us all. He asks no quarter and gives none. THE 

CASE OF AUSTRIA. Second only in importance to the president's Statement of the objectives of the United States in the war and the bases for peace, is his recom mendation that recognition of a state of war with Austria-Hungary be declared. In fhis he ran counter to the guesses of those who attempted to forecast his speech, yet the proposal, as a matter of fact, was neither startling nor unexpected. It was inevitable, a foregone conclusion of the THE W A "-dl l NT, ION

Austria would have asserted it- If and w!este*. itself from the domi nation of (iermany and etfeeted peace. There were many indications durinu the spring and summer ih.it such miirht be tl'.e ease, hut the iron hand of (Jeriaany. its commercial, political, gov erniiiental and militaristie power so domineered that Austria dared not. could not break the grip. The United States could not continue longer in its anomalous position, for all the while it sought to maintain a friendly, helpful attitude toward that country, its people resident in this country were the nefarious tools of the German system of sabotage among us. We of the Northwest know this particularly, know that in nearly every in stance the anarchists, the agitators spreading I. W. W. doctrines, inciting to industrial revolu tions, depredations and destruction, are Austrians, not Germans. This situation here at home doubtless was a compelling force in prompting the president's recommendation. Certainly it is a situation that must be dealt with immediately and severely. A declaration of war will make that possible. "No annexations, no contributions, no punitive indemnities," a phrase to which much publicity has been given during recent months snd which, as President Wilson says, "has been made dili gent use of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray," is nevertheless accepted by the president as expressive of the basis upon which the United States will seek peace when the power of autocracy is encom passed. "The fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea is no reason why a right use should not be made of it," he says, but. in the next sentence points out that "it is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the pres ent masters of Germany command." "But when that has been done," lie continues, "we shall at last be; free to do an unprecedented thing and this is the time to avow our purpose to do it. We shall be free to base peace on gener osity and justice, to" the exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage, even on the part of the victors," another thought which is repeatedly stated throughout his address. He proceeds to point out that "Germany's suc cess by skill, by industry, by knowledge, by en terprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and influence, secured by the peace of the world * * * but at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not exceK the rivals she most feared and hated." Having thus clearly established the fact that the United States became Germany's enemy only frhen convinced that she had started out to dom inate the world by arms, the president proceeds to break Germany's long-cherished dream of "Mitteleuropa" with the declaration that "the peace we make must remedy that wrong." He sets forth America's version of peace in these words: "It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and Northern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria- Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and Asia, from the impudent and alien domination of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy." - There is no mistaking his meaning—the dream of Prussian militarists, the burden of the teach ings of Prussian scholars, diplomats, journalists, preachers and commercial leaders since the war of 1870, of a German empire stretching from "Berlin to Bagdad, yes from Antwerp to Bag dad," dominating commercially and industrially if not governmentally all the intervening smaller nations as well as Austria-Hungary—"Mittel europa" as it Avas fondly called — is to be shat tered. So the president puts before the world as our spokesman America's declaration of the objective we seek, with the affirmation that we Americans "are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise, deeply and indignantly patient," and with the further and even more emphatic assertion that "those who desire to bring about peace before that purpose (winning the war) is achieved, I counsel to take their ad vice elsewhere—we will not entertain it." But. "\vh< n this thing and its power are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace—when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the bases of law and of covenant for the life of the world, we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay it ungrudgingly."

BETTMAN'S Everything to Wear for Men and Boys. r WHAT HAPPENED IN OLYMPIA N STATE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO From The Washington Standard for Friday evening, December 0, 1802. Vol. XXXIII. No. 3. Whole Num ber 1710. In a shingle mill at Gray's Harbor recently the entire works were kept running all day on a single cedar stick, which made 188,500 shingles. The legislature will convene the second Monday in January. Arrangements are being made at Seatte for a grand celebration there on the occasion of the completion of the Great Northern railroad, which is expected to be about January 15. The strange case of Moses H. Scott was decided by the supreme court last Monday. Scott disappeared from Olympia in 1881. After a lapse of seven years, during which time he was not heard from, his estate was probated on petition of his sister, on the ground that his long absence without being heard from was evi dence of his death. A year ago he re-appeared and brought suit to eject John McNeal from lands of Scott sold in the probate proceedings. The superior court decided against Scott and the supreme court affirms the judgment. Saturday morning our community was inexpressibly shocked by the an nouncement of the violent death of Col. Thomas Boyd, editor of the Olympian, which had occurred in Seattle, about 10 o'clock the pre vious night. The remains were buried in the Masonic ' cemetery Wednesday. Westside is petitioning for free de livery of mail. Annie Besant, the famous lecturer, will probably visit Olympia. The Theosophical society is now in cor respondence with ber. Preparatory steps for the organi zation of a social club were taken by about 25 representative young men at The Olympia Monday evening. Van Etten Second Lieutenant. At the outbreak of war John C. Van Etten, son of Mrs. C. E. Van Etten of this city and a student at Reed College, Portland, at once vol unteered and helped organize Com pany A, United States engineers. In August he entered the second officer's training camp and was recommended for a first lieutenancy of artillery. Then a special call came from the war department for 20 picked men for the signal corps. Mr. Van Etten was one of those selected and, at tracted by the promise of immediate service, sacrificed one rank, was com missioned ranking second lieutenant and left last week under orders. Van Etten is a member of the Society of the Sons of the American Revolu tion and of the Tellurlde Association. Lumbering Most Dangerous.
