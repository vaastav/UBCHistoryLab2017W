Dr. Shaw, the first speaker, said that no attempt was to be mad' to convert the rules committee to woman suffrage, but that the suffragists merely wanted a suffrage committee in the House. Suffrage Crowded Out. Mrs Helen II Gardener made the point that because of President Wilson's deter mination to get trust legislation this year tbe judiciary committee, which has al ways considered suffrage in the House, will be too busy to gi\t- proper atten tion to votes for women. "The judiciary committee is warned that it i* to he heavily burdened during this Congress." said Mrs Gardener. "As never hefif* the question of woman suf Omega .

"Four states?Nevada. Montana and North and South Dakota will vote* on suffrage in 1914. The legis latures of eight other states gave a majority vote in favor of submitting suf frage amendments this year." She said that until 1884 the House had a suffrage committee. Mrs. Harper re ferred to the suffrage parade here last March, saying the acts of men on that occasion were disgraceful. Miss Jane Addams Speaks. Miss Jane Addams was the next speak er. She took up the states right ques- i tion, bearing on the question of whether Congress has the right to control the voting qualifications. She showed that in a number of instances Congress has exercised control of who shall vote in the states. 1 here is a wave of public opinion i growing over this land in favor of this movement." she continued. "We expect that twice as many women will be vot ing In two years." Representative I la rd wick ol" Georgia suggested that the House committee on ' the election of President and Vice Presi- ! dent might be glad to consider woman suffrage. Mr. Henry said that Repre-! sentativ e Rucker of Missouri is chair man of that committee. He said that "perhaps you would like to know how he stands on suffrage." "We do not care about that so much."! replied Dr. Shaw, "but w<- do care that' the committee shall heed what the peo ple of the country want." Retort Causes laughter. One of the members of the committee said that the committee mentioned is a "dead" one. "It wouldn't remain dead lung if we got at it, retorted Dr. Shaw, amid laughter. Miss Desha Breckenridge of Ken tucky, a granddaughter of Henry Clay, declared that a constitutional amend ment for suffrage will not harm the south. "1 must admit," she said, "that the men of my state now speak oratorically of women in connection with horses and whisky, and politically in connection with idiots and criminals." Objection Over Committee. Objection l?o the idea of turning the suffiage question over to the commit tee on the election of President and Vice President was made by Repre sentative Roper of California. He said that because of the President's recom mendation for presidential primaries this committee probably w ill be very busy. "You have committees to consider every other kind of a question." he con tinued. "Why not one for this ques tion ?" Representative Garrett of Teunensee asked if it was not expected by the women that the proposed committee be composed of men favorable to suf frage . Mr. Roper replied that all that was desired was that the committee be fair. Dr. Shaw interjected liiat even if a committee against suffrage should be named it could be won over.

President Wilson's Failure to Advocate Woman Suffrage Is Criticised by Convention President Wilson's failure to apeak of woman suffrage irt his message to Con gress yesterday was made the subject of several speeches delU'ered at the Na tional American Woman Suffrage Asso ciation convention at the New Masonic Temple last night, which resulted in the adoption of a resolution criticising his | stand. , Tiie resolution, introduced by Mrs. .1. William t-unk of Maryland, was as fol j lows: "!t is the sense of this meeting that ident Wilson failed to rise to the sup.imlst heights of democracy when he tailed in his message to Congress to recommend the freedom of half the citi i MHS. 

MAID MISKH OF CHICAGO. zens of the United States, and probably half the citizens of the civilized world " Some Defenders of President. The resolution was adopted by an over whelming: majority, although some of the more conservative suffragists voted against it on the ground that the Presl | dent had, so many important subjects to j consider in his message that he should not be criticised for not mentioning votes for women. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the national association, brought up the subject when she made a short address. She declared that the President said In his message that the time has come for an extension of greater social justice, and that she had hoped he would include some measure of political justice. Dr. Shaw called attention to the fact that President Wilson in his message urged the necessity of the extension of the ballot to the Filipinos ?nd territorial voters' rights. for Alaska. Several other delegates to the conven tion made statements along the same line. Need of Court Reforms. "Women and Children in the Courts" was Mte general topic of the addresses last night. The speakers included Mrs. , Joseph T. Bowen of Chicago. Judge Har | ry Olsen. who spokf on "The Court of ! Domestic Relations and the Couri of Morals." and Miss Maude Miner, who spoke 011 "The Women's Xight Court and the Work of a Probation Officer." "From the time of the arrest of a woni man." said Mrs. Bowen. "to the final dis position of her case she is handicapped by being in the charge of and surrounded by men. who naturally cannot be expect ed to be as sympathetic and understand ing as one of her own sex. In the police station she is at a disadvantage, for such places of detention in most of our large : cities are not tit for human habitation. In Chicago the majority of them are da.'k and insanitary. The women are herded together, the innocent with guilty, the clean with the unclea*. the young girl j with the prostitute. The sleeping accom modations are vile. "When the woman appears for her pre liminary hearing she is tousled and un tidy as the result of being without proper toiiet accommodations, and is therefore apt to create an unfavorable Impression. In all police stations separate rooms or cells should be provided, with plenty of light and air and sleeping and toilet ac commodations for the women." Mrs. Bowen toid of what had been done to meet this situation in Chicago by the I establishment of the court of domestic relations and the morals court. The lat I ter hears the caaes of women charged j with improper conduct. Compromise Is Forced. l'ear oi" bringing on a revolt that might give America a militant suffragist or ganization yesterday caused leaders in the National Woman Suffrage Association to abandon their efforts to have adopted MRS.

REPORT FAVORABLY ON POST OFFICE BIUS I ?????. House Committee Indorses ' Proposed Changes in Pos tal Savings Service. The House committee on post offices and post roads, at its session yesterday, after Third Assistant Postmaster Gen i eral Dockery had appeared before it by | direction of the Postmaster General, de cided to report favorably the bill remov i ing the restriction of $100 placed on the amounts that may be received as a postal I savings deposit from any person within a calendar month and increasing the amount upon which interest may be paid from $"4M) to 11.000. The bill, if it becomes a law. said Mr. Dockery today, will allow postal savings : depositories to receive from a single de ; positor any amount he cares to deposit: j but it provides that interest shall be paid j only on the maximum amount of $1,000. ; even though the deposits exceed that amount. It was said that Monday a depositor called with $1,500, but. as the clerk at the Washington office could accept only *100 of it. he decided not to split the amount, i but to invest it in money orders for safe ; keeping. Another depositor who called j the same day offered $3<R>. $100 of which was accepted and a certificate therefor I was issued. A short while later he called to say that he had either lost or had stolen from him the other $UOO. The proposed bill will make these occurrences impossible. The House committee also, it is said, de cided to report favorably the bill author izing the payment of money orders at any post office. At present they may be paid only at the offices on which they are drawn. Other bills in which the department is interested, such as the one relieving post masters from individual responsibility for losses of postal savings funds by fire, burglary or other unavoidable accidents, it is understood, are also to be favorably reported.
