On his return he pictured heaven In glowing terms to the entire Mud Ray trtbe. declaring that lots of Indians Were there and that each Indian ha.d a horse and plenty of salmon. All the Indians at Mud Bay and Oyster Bay became his followers, and the remain ing years of his life were spent in ex tending the Shaker religion among the Puyallup, Skokomish, Clallam and oth er Indian tribes. Previous to his alleged visit to heaven John had been a very wicked Indian, drinking, gambling and swearing. These vices he discarded, and after his trance he lived an exemplary life.

This sect has built churches on six reservations in Western Washington. They believe in God, and lay stress on leading temperate lives. They hold periodical revivals, when the leaders testify to their faith by a prolonged shaking of their bodies, which habit has given them the name of Shakers. COURSING AT INGLESIDE.

The Controversy is Attracting Much Attention. Possible Effect of the Spirit of the Civil Service Law. Rapier Refuses to Surrender the Office to Barker, Claiming That the Revised Statutes Provide That Second-Class Postmasters Are Appointed for Four Tears, and He Wants to Fill Out His Term, as Barker Did. MOBILE (Ala,). Dec. s.—The con troversy over the Postmastership at I Mobile iB attracting attention on ac j count of the important legal phases of 'the case and the possible effect of the j spirit of the civil service law. Post j master Rapier, who refuses to sur render the office to P. B. Barker, is a j Cleveland appointee, whose commission is dated December 11, 1894, and hits ! official term will therefore expire De cember, lfeOS. Mr. Rapier contends that ! the section of the Revised Statutes, j under which second-class Postmasters (are appointed, provides in terms that jsuch Postmasters are appointed for the | term of four years, and can be removed jby the President only and with the advice and consent of the Senate. | The President on the Ist of October I gave to P. D. Barker, a Republican, a commission as Rapier's successor. I Barker, who was out of the city, did | not return until recently, and on the j Ist of December demanded of Post j master Rapier the surrender of the of j fice. Mr. Rapier claims he received |no notice of his removal according to i law. and will not surrender the office until the legality of his removal has been passed on by the courts. Barker, the new appointee, was Postmaster at Mobile during the Harrison Adminis tration. and served his full term of four years. 

ALFRED CHENEY'S CASE. He Is Making an Effort to Gain the President's Pardon. NEW YORK, Dec. s.—Alfred Cheney, one of the famous Cheney brothers, is making an effort to get out of the peni tentiary, where he is serving a life sen tence. Cheney's two brothers were hanged for their 'share in an Indian Territory train robbery and he came near sharing their fate. There was some doubt as to his actual participa tion in the robbery, however, and this saved him from the scaffold. A number of prominent men have in terested themselves in Cheney during the past two years and are doing their utmost to get the President to pardon him. They have looked carefully into his case, and say it looks very much as though Cheney was the victim of prej udice against Mb family in Indian Ter ritory. His claim that he was twenty miles away from the scene of the rob bery on the night it occurred seems to be true, and there is a possibility that when the President has a chance to weigh the evidence he will pardon Cheney. Cheney is broken down men tally and physically. The hold-up took place at Pryor's Creek fn the fall of 1803. it was one of the famous train roblK-ries of recent years, not on account of the amount of money stolen, but because of its hu morous features. At least two of the Cheney boys and a desperado known as "Dynamite Jack" were engaged in it. The trio boarded the train at a small way station and began operations when Pryor's Creek was reached. The men had revolvers in their pockets, but "Dynamite Jack" thought it would be fun to bluff the passengers instead of intimidating them with real firearms. He had a glass bottle made in the shape of a revolver and full of whisky. He Whipped this out and madf the pas sengers throw up their hands. Then the Cheney boys went down the aisle relieving the passengers of their valu ables. When they had secured everything of value in the car "Dynamite Jack" pulled the bell rope, and as the train slowed up he threw the glass revolver on the floor and smashed it. Then he laughed in the faces of the passengers, called them a lot of curs and cowards, and, with the Cheney boys, jumped from the train. When the officers got on the trail of the robbers they soon ran them down. They caught all three after a fight in which many shots were exchanged. Al fred Cheney was arrested next day at his heme. His brothers and "Dynamite Jack" protested against Alfred's ar rest. They insisted that he not only had no hand in the robbery, but did not even know it was even? to take place. Th- pei pie of Indian Territory v. re getting tired of dee] redoes, b >w ever, and all four men had to suffer. "Dynamite Jack" got the same sen tence as Alfred Cheney, although the brothers of the latter while on the seef fold, swore he was innocent. Both men were brought East and placed in the Kings County Penitentiary four years ago.

ANNUAL REPORT OF SURGEON GENERAL WYMAN. It Treats of Ravages of Various Diseases in Our Own and Foreign Countries. WASHINGTON, Dec. o.—Surgeon- General Wyman of the Marine Hospital Service has submitted his annual re port to Secretary" Gage. It shows that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1897, the total number of patients treated art hospitals and the dispensa ries connected with the service was 54, --777. Although the total number of patients treated was 074 in excess of those treated during the previous fiscal year, the expenditures were $538,356, which lis $21,000 less than for the pre vious year. The number of immi grants inspected by officers of the ser vice at the various ports aggregated 232.147. The appearance of cholera in Japan and China, says the Surgeon- General, is now a matter of greater moment to the United States than at any previous time, owing to the rapid growth of commerce between these countries and the Pacific Coast. Small pox is reported as having appeared in sixteen States between November 1, 1896, and November 1, 189T- in the year previous it appeared in twenty two States. The prevalence of the bubonic plage in the Eastern Hemis phere has offered a new problem for the consideration of the health author ities of the United States. The disease is reported as increasing at present in Northern India. It has also appeared in certain portions of China and Japan. The report cf the international leprosy conference held in Berlin in October, gives a somewhat imperfect statement of tiie number of cases of leprosy in the different countries in the world, there being approximately 130.000 m India. 20,066 in Japan, 2,oiH) in Hawaii. 1.20 Din Russia. 700 in Calcutta, 250 in the United States. Yellow fever has been unusually pre valent throughout the island of Cuba during the past year. In the port of Havana alone, from November 1. 1866, to November 1. 1807, there were 1,(505 deaths. The disease has also prevailed ext( nsively throughout the West Indies. The total number of cases of yellow feVer reported to the bureau up to No vember 20th. was 4.195, and the num ber of deaths 423. Of these there were 1,722 cases and 244 deaths in New Or leans. The national station was removed from Chandler to Ship Island in 1894 after the destruction of the Chandler station by a storm which swept the hospital out to sea and drowned five people. Its transfer is legalised by the Appropriation Act of 1595. Th« Surgeon-General again refers to the necessity of a more strict national quarantine law. which he has made the subject of a special report in the past two years, and he makes recommenda tions looking to the strengthening of the law both to prevent the spread of disease and interference with interstate commerce during the times of epidem ics. 

BLACK JACK'S GANG SEEN CAMPING ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF BISBEE. Said to Bo Waiting for a Chance to Kill Three Men Whom They Have Marked. BISBEE (Ariz.), Dec. s.—Black Jack s gang was seen camped twenty miles sjuth of here, across the line, to-day by a prominent cattleman on his way from Mexico. There v.eie nine men, ail well aimed, having good horses, and they had apparently gathered for some new exploit. The Mexican knew three of the outlaws weli. they having been cowboys in this vicinity for a number of years. A cowboy whom he met before reaching them told him that the cut throats were in the vicinity for the purpose of killing three men whom they had marked. The first man they want is Bert Al vord, the Wilcox (Ariz.), Constable, who shot and killed Bill King a few weeks ago while resisting arrest for drunk enness. King was a cowboy who as sisted Black Jack and his gang to es cape when they were so closely pursued last fall, just after the robbery of the depot at Huschuca Siding, and they have swoin to avenge his death The other men are Deputy Sheriff Bill Hildreth and Line-rider Sam King. Hil dreth has been hunting these men down for months, and it was he who first con nected them with the Grant-station train robbery. Sam King is a marked man, because he caused them trouble after they had killed Line-rider Robin son nearly two years ago. Two of these men have been warned to be on their guard. Hildreth left Tombstone this morning for the line alone in pursuit of a clew to the whereabouts of the gang, and could not be warned. Should he run upon them alone he is a doomed man. and his friends here to-night are very uneasy. For certain reasons the posses were taken off the trail. The impression is that it was because they thought it useless to pursue the robbers into the fastnesses of the Ajo Mountains, but such is not the case. The three members of the gang who were arrested on Thanksgiving Day at Fronteras—Jesse Williams. Tom Ander son and an unknown —are still separ ated from the main gang and were seen yesterday by a cattleman named Fisher near the Souse Ranch at the l>ase of the Ajo Mountains. These three outlaws, who were thrown into jail at Fronteras on Thanksgiving Day for "shooting up" the town, were held nearly four days awaiting word from the United States authorities. At the end of that time a notorious Mexican outlaw arrived at Fronteras, had some conference with the authorities and the men were heav ily fined and turned loose. They rode to La Morifa Custom-house and slept there Sunday night and made for the Ajo Mountains in the They left an old stocking in a room at a hotel there were fourteen silver dollars, which are in the hands of Fred Dodge, Wells, Fargo & Co.'s detective. The coins are very badly mutilated, some being bent double by the force of the explosion of the 3afe in the express car. From persons at La Morita it was learned that they inquired as to the time when the paymaster went through there to Nacosari to pay off the men at work in the mines there, and this may be the reason for their gathering there. Telegrams are being sent in all direc tions to-night repotting the wheres> bouts of the robbers. Officers have been working very quietly, and it is thought the drawing off of the posses is a. blind to gain time to notify all small frontier towns in Mexico to be on the lookout and arrest the outlaws should they show up. As soon as this Fs done a raid will be made on the gang from several quarters. A CONVICT BANKER'S WIFE. She Tells Governor Leady How She Has Managed to Exist. TOPEKA (Kan.). Dec. 5 — Mrs. Wightman, the wife of an ex-banker now serving a term in the penitentia ry for using the bank's funds, in an appeal to-day for pardon before Gov ernor Deedy, made a statement show ing how she had managed to live on the barren plains of Western Kansas dur ing her husband's incarceration, which brought tears to the executive's eyes.

YAQUI RIVER GOLD FIELDS. Reports From the Hew El Dorado Greatly Exaggerated. DENVER, Dec. 4.—A special to the ••Republican" from Santa Fe. N. M. says: For the past sixty days scores ot prospectors from Colorado and the Northern States haVe been passing through New Mexico en route to the Yaqui River placer fields in Sonora. Mexico. The rush caused much ex | citement in this Territory, and recently ; delegations of mining men have start ed in there from Albuquerque, Silver CSty, Santa Fe and other points. However, Special Agent H. C. Flip per of the United States Land Court, who returned to-day from Hermosillo and vicinity, tells a story that will dis hearten all the seekers after wealth in this new Ei Dorado. He says hun- I die.is of miners who have spent the ' last few weeks along the Yaqui River are now struggling to get out and re ! turn to the United States. The reports of gold dtscnver?es there have been greatly exaggerated. People who rush ed in seemed to think that a scoop and a gunnysack was all that was necessa jry to secure a fortune, but. said Flipper, j while gold has been known to exist ! along the Yaqui River for many years !it is by no means a poor man's Mecca If it can be saved at all, it must be done only by the use of expensive hy draulic operations.

Will Only be Referred to in the President's Message Casually. WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.—President McKinley in his forthcoming message to Congress will not discuss in a sig nificant way the recent monetary ne gotiations of the Walcott commission, but will refer to it in only a casual way. The chief interest in the financial part of his message will attach to a recommendation that gold shall be paid only for greenbacks, and that green backs shall be paid only for gold. The President does not believe that Congress will retire the notes, and it is his opinion that where there is a constant surplus of receipts over ex penditures and an exchange of gold and notes, there is no longer any menace to the country. He does not contem plate the retirement of treasury notes, but only a change of classifications, for the reason that if retired there would always be a talk of contraction of the currency, and he does believe that if gold and greenbacks are made lnter-

CABINET. No Change Contemplated Before the First of the Year. Washington Dec 4. -Fi m the best obtainable information, it app, *.s composition of the Cabinet during the remainder of the current year. There are two good reasons for tins. Attorney-General McKenna has charg d himself with the prosecution of the Pacific railroad cases, and it is not to be supposed that he will relinquish his present office until the Kansas Pacific sale has passed into history. it is generally understood that Gov ernor Griggs of New Jersey has been offered the place in the Cabinet to be vacated by Attorney-General McKen na. but it will not be possible for him to take the oflice before the beginning of r.ext year. The New Jersey Constk tutlon fails to make provision for a Lieutenant-Governor, and toe su r to the Governor would be the President of the State Senate, who is limited in the assumption to office to the time when the Legislature is in actual ses sl"!!. which will not occur until Janu ary Ist. Should Governor Griggs re linquish his place now, there conse qu-ntly could be no head to the State Government during the period of time between new and January Ist, and the Governor is unwilling to leave matteis in such a state.
