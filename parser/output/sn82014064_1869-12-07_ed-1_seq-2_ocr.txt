The Republican party cm well i rd, so lung as its principles and practice sound, to rely on its ability to secure a ority of any vote fairly taken, whether be people or in the Legislature: and it r the true interest of the Stale, and of Republican principles, that any other y have the same fair chance s come into power if their [ ciples command the assent of the ority of the people. Trickery and <>' will injure any party that attempts iL • ; the organization of the convention, it irlv due to the political sentiment of Sut«\ and to its large Republican ma v. tiut tbe presiding officer should be •publican. Any other course than this U bo so wide a departure from manifest k-o r.ud common usage as almost iubly to defeat tbe work of the conven- Aitcr the convention has organized, tlt all the questions which will come it wSI bo wholly non-partisan.

Should »at amendment, by any chance, remain gratified, the convention would doubtless qree in submitting to the people, separate a clause conferring the right of suffrage. »There remains, therefore, only tho quos of the formation of legislative districts which there can be any party division, tbo conduct of parties in gerrymandering districts in our own and other Italcs has been the standing disgrace and x crpetxxal stumbling block of their Consti iitional Conventions. It is exceedingly jCfiirablo that this irritating question shall <e kept wholly oat of tho convention. Xbo llament it eaters the convention will be hanged from an assemblage of constitu tional reformers into a cabal of political in !rigucrs. There is no possibility of the .eliberations of the convention resolting in ■'xt great good, or in any benefits j ,o the State proportionate to the op portunity it confers, after the members ‘if either party have begun to “ gerryman der ” the districts. They will be worse han partisans, for many of the members ;will have forgotten even the interests of their party in their desire to carve out dis ’irictrt for themselves. If the convention Vould preserve its deliberative calmness, its public spirit, its legislative pride, Its desire to render the State a service which will ■leave its enduring impress for good for .half a century to come, it must resolve rfrum the start not to bring this firebrand .unto its councils. The most obvious means ''of avoiding it is Uie best. Lot the coaven- ' ition provide that tbo districts shall bo np ‘portioned by the first Legislature which r shall assemble otter the taking of the census of H7O, and that the proposed increass in :tho camber of members shall not take cf- Jfect until then. In advance of the pnblica f lion the cdusus tho convention will • nave no upon which to base an cclimate oitnc population of • tho respective counties Any | apportionment tho convention may make * will !>o necessarily made in ignorau->o a of the fact on which alone it justly can be 1 ‘ mode, viz., the actual population. Being ynndA on imperfect data, it will bo likely t<^ * endanger the ratification of the constitn t tion, and will be certain to pervert it. The , ® proposed constitution will, of coarse, pra- < vide that a tecond apportionment shall be ‘ made by the Legislature after the State ' census of 187.', and equally strong reasons would suggest that the first apportionment r > be made by the Legislature after the * taking of the national census of 1370, „ the result of which, so far as popn ■ latiun is concerned, will undoubted? be r made known to the next Legislature - nt its regular seraion. This will strip the convention, and, of necessity, the canstita • tion they will adopt, of all partisan charac ter, and will prepare the people to watch their deliberations with sincere respect, and, » probably, to heartily adopt the result at £ which they may arrive. t e FUtASCE HI THE 

EAST.* TLc Kew York Tribune scouts our notice c f tho false rumor that capitalists are anxious to lend the government all the ■ money it wants at 4 per cent, when they • can, by purchase of its bonds at existing : prices obtain not leffi than 7 per cent. It f ; eaya: i “mat opwiUoa Journals should seek toem t tartc»i»ndli.p«rde such funding by all inctr re m crcce cl eusal calculations ana prediction*, u ucfortunat* nut not unnatural; butthey ought to • be Jett aloes to such »orrj busmeai" If the editor of the Tribune were honest - in thin paragraph he would be bold enough .• 1 to v aj that be differed with ns m oar main _ i point, i. e., that he believes that now, 1 1 ; while the lenders to the government are actually getting 7 per cent on our j 1 Dctuinullv C and 5 per cent bonds, they ‘ • arc willing to-day to lend to ns at 4 per \ ■ cent on no higher security. He cither be- > libYcs this or he docs mt. If ho believes i it, bl% view is quite worily of the author of the financial proposition that “ The rood to resumption is to resume." If he does not, he fce«*e with «*• 116 Ik dishonest In charging us with *‘ sorry business” in stating what be Umself knows to be tree, and, because true, therefore ns e- J tut and proper to be known by ill. It mty * i>t that bo thinks the credit of tie govern* I xuent cm be strengthened by the publication of bubble boasts which be docs not Relieve, bnt which some numskulls may. Be would , | nurse a few judicious lies by waj of 1 strengthening the truth, or perhaps jlay the Borcum with our public credit, on fto • * theory that, if the public could. I it was a woolly the genuine wool I * wonld grow; h~hn Trif'iinr, on December r 2, scales upon the fact, fully explained in ’ Vo- columns on November 2?, that we had > inadvertently quoted the gold price of the I bonds in sterling instead of in American i b gold, which reduces by a third of one per ' » cent the rate of interest alleged as the t actual rate to the purchaser of the 5-20 s, > and by still less the rate received on the » 10.40 a. While this fact in no way affects « the principle involved in our argument, and puts not a grain of truth into the false* i hood we were combatting, the profound < financier of the Tribune demands: c «• bow can one eJocMaie Finance wbo U igno ** rant ot its amplest elements ot fact 7 e As well might we exclaim, How can one elucidate Finance who spells the word with i a capital F, and lends fourteen thousand ■*- -nnnji .Vanderbilt; without Treasury is embarrassed by haring the troth relative to our national credit made known to the people, or that he would bo helped by falsehoods. On the contrary, the reitera tion for a year or two of the statement that foreign capitalists are eager to lend the amount of our debt to na at 4 per cent, while it would not induce a single foreign capitalist, to make the loon, would excite general discontent with an administration which was supposed to be constantly neglecting such a golden opportunity. If there is any newspaper influence now at work tending to prevent the advance of our bonds to par, and so postpone the work, sooner or later to bo begun, of reducing onx rates Ol interest, it is the advjw which Mr. Greeley is constantly and laboriously giving in the Tritmne to oil holders of gov ernment bonds to sell them and invest in railroad securities. Such advice aims di rectly to throw government bonds on the market in largo quantities, and so reduce their price and prevent their refunding. Xo amount of favor with which Mr. Gree ley can coddle and nourish the stupid lies set afloat about the alleged offers of foreign : capitalists can neutralize the direct effect of his own advice to ah bondholders to sell their bonds. Were it acted upon by all to whom it is addressed, sow and in the fu ture, the period for reducing the rate of in terest which the government bos to pay would never come, and our bonds wonld decline one-half. The Tribunt apparently has no motive in giving this advice, except to assist its advertisers who are trying to sell their railroad bonds. If the Tribune would wait, however, lotting the bond holders retain their bonds, and ad vise merely the holders of real estate, farms, manufactories, and mines to sell their property and invest the proceeds in railroad bonds, it is possible that before a groat while the government bonds might come to par; and should the government attempt to fond them it might advertise them in the New York Tribune, TEE CURBEHCYREPORT. The Comptroller of the Currency, in hia report, published yesterday, discusses two subjects of great interest and importance, the first cautiously and inconclusively, the second thoroughly and with perfect com* mand of his subject. His first point is that the business of “receiving deposits” should not be construed or allowed to permit Na tional Banks to attract deposits by paying interest on them; that the habit of doing so attracts loanable capital to New York, where it can be loaned “on call” to speculators (loans on call being preferred by bankers to loans on time, where they are lending the money of depositors, who are liable to draw it oat by check at any moment) ; that, while call loans are ruling at 5 to 7 per cent, there fore, time-loans are often worth 1 ■"> per cent, I which means 7 per cent to speculators, 13 1 per cent to merchants. The Comptroller favors a law restraining banks from pay ing interest on deposits. Upon the other point,—the necessity of withdrawing the greenbacks, and issuing National Bank notes pnri pat*u in their stead, and providing for making the Na tional Banking system immediately free to all who choose to secure the redemption of their notes in specie,—Mr. Hnlburd's re port is sound, able, and evidently trne. Those who have been muddled by the specious theorythat the government should abolish the National Banks and issue all the currency itself in greenbacks, will do well to study carefully Mr. Halbard's argu ment, which, though brief, is conclusive. He shows that the people have the benefit, in reduced rates of interest, of the cur rency famished to tl v banks. His argu ment on this point is worth reproducing entire: “A bank with 1100,000 capital invested in seen rules betrlrg 6 per cent interest, upon which it basrocetsed $90,000 In circulation, can lend tbit $90,000 at 7 per cent, amt yet realize a profit of 311SOO on Its capital. Toe private banker, lending bis capital or Sioo,ooo dirocUjr, suit charge bis customers 12 per cent to realize tbe same profit aa the bant. 'The merchant and .tbe tradesman know ibis, and expect to pay about ttiat difference for tbe me of money wbeu iter necessl'-tos com pel them to resort to private bankers or brokers. “Tbe gcvernmsnt, therefore, confers a greater boon upon the boatnesa public, by eoabiios it to borrow money at moderate rates of Interest than is generally realized or admitted. If all toe biota vue deprived of them ctrcaUUon daring the com ing year, by act of Congress, the rates at whies money comd be borrowed in most sections or tba conntrv wonld be nearly doubled. Tbe assomp i:un by tbe government of tbe sole power to is*hft circniatlrg notes would in do alee inrush relief. The United States can get Its notes in‘o clrcnla non by paying them oat for Ua expenses, and in psTment of ua debla. Not being able to do a bank ing business, however, it cannot Iced mem as a tank car, bnt wonld have to pay them ont to its creditor?, and, la »he end, tbe notes wonld come trto tbe hands of capitalist?, who wonld lend them j to the people at talgn rates of Interest. •> Taking tbe coootry as a whole, government and people aa one, the profit gamed uytbe gov ertment on tbe issue ot its own notes—or, to asesn expression in common uae, the amount saved by tbe nse of its own notes as a loan without interest —wonld not compensate fur tbe additional tax noon ibe boslceas of tbe country, advance tn th* r»u> or uiteiesl wnicb wonld bo luci? to follow such a change In the circulation. “ Tbe amount leaned by the National banks to the business interests of the conntrv will average atom 1700,000,000; and for every addition of 1 per cent to the rate ot interest, a tax of not lest than $7,000,000 would be imposed on the basinets of tnc cootiliy. An increase of 6 per cent to tbe rate of interest wonld make tbe tax not less than $35/00,000. This wooid be tne actual money tax. But tbe depression esnsed by this additional bur den, while u wonld t»c a very serious drawback to tbe prosperity of tbe country, coaid not well be estimated lu morev. As agontrai thing, National Banka lend money to ttselr customers at abont tbe legal rates; though, of coarse, .there are excep tional cmi." We are glad to see tbe views which wo have steadily maintained for tho past four years so ably presented by tho bead of tho Currency Bureau, and are encouraged to believe that this influence,with the growing tendency of public opinion in tho some direction, as exhibited in the columns of our exchanges, will lead to tbe passage of a law by the present Congress providing for tbo retirement of tbe greenbacks, the sub stitution of the bank notes, and free bank ing on the specie basis. The first need of the country is to get rid of the greenbacks. The second is a supply of a paper currency at par with specie. These objects provided for, the people will very soon adjust their accounts to tho gold standard, and accept it as their par of enonnt and exchange for all future transaction:. The new city and comty government entered upon tbeir offices yesterday. J. J. Kearney was elected Chairman of the lioard of Supervisors, and John Comiskey presiding officer of the Common Conned —the latter by a nearly unanimous vote. It happens that both these gentlemen are Democrats, and that they received the united support of the Aldermen and Super visors who were elected on the straight Re publican ticket and those holding over who supported that ticket. This would acctn to indicate that the millennium is not far distant. Mayor Mason delivered bis inaugural ad dress last evening, and claimed the right under tbo city charter to preside over tho Council, but yielded under protest to the claim of the ucwly-elcclcd presiding officer to discharge the duties of that office. The City Treasurer, Mr. Gage, sent in a com munication, with his official bond, stating that he had made arrangements with certain banka to pay to tlif rity four and one-half per cent interest on the average balances of the city u*po*dta. Alderman "Woodard raised some objections to the practice of “loaning tho city funds,*' as it is termed, and pending tbo discussion of tho question whether it is lawful for the city to receive the interest on its own money tho Council adjourned. The enthusiastic New Yorker who sub. scribes fifty thousand dollars toward the formation of a vigilance committee to sup press crime means well, but we fear ho has almost as imperfect a conception of the magnitude of the work as did those «th« enthusiasts who, a few years ago, proposed to pay off tho national debt by subscrip tion. A vigilance committee in New York to suppress crime is a good thing. Bat fifty thousand dollars is but a meagre be ginning when the enemy to be fought con trols the city government, tbe courts, tho Democratic party, and the Erie Bailway* In Maryland, at the recent election, the tdla for state Comptroller was: For Wool ford (Dcm.), 52.5T*! for MeKellip (Eop.). S 3 412. Not one EepnhUcan was th’oecn to either house of the Legislature. There will be an nnbroken Democratic rep* reaenUtion in both bouses, and the 23,412 Bepoblican electors will bo wholly unrepre sented, and, for all practical purposes, as much disfranchised as the negroes of that State. If the plan of minority representation trcre in force in Maryland, the Republicans vould secure at least one-fourth, and per-. haps nearly a third, of the members of both houses. Apportion Maryland into triple districts, each electing three mem bers, And give each toUt the right to concen trate or distribute his rote as be pleased, and, the Republicans, by concentrating their on otQ in__ejich dis trict, couldelect him, unless' tlioy**cast Tdis than ono-ouarter of the rotes, which is not it land tiiat the Republicans ware represented in proportion to their voting strength, and better for the purity of legislation. The present system of exclusive majority repre sentation is wrong from every point of view, and demands reform. It is reported that Senator Drake is about to introduce a bill in Congress, which ought to be entitled **A bill to abolish fbo constitu tion.” It proposes that hereafter no United States Court shall have power to decide on act of Congress to bo unconstitutional. Of course if no United States Court can do so, any attempt of a State Court to do so would bo overruled by the superior power of the National Government, The result would be that no law of Congress could bo annulled for unconstitutionality, oven though it might abolish the State Govern ments, or provide for the establishment of a hereditary monarchy. The constitution would no longer form any check on Con gress. Wo should have no Constitution of tbe United States, and each State Legisla ture might, by a similar act of its own, abolish its constitution. It is not too much to say that the member of either house who is intellectually capable of introducing such a bill deserves expulsion on tbe ground of menial Imbecility. Uo is non compos menti*. The Comptroller of the Currency is not exact in his statement >f the outstanding currency. lie says: “Daring tbe past year It has neither increased nor diminished, hot stands about as it did mis time last year—f»o,coo,otw issued by the govern ment, and |30t),o00,000 issued by tbe banks—nei ther redeemsole cor convertible into anything more valuable, and therefore not susceptible of redaction by any ordinary process; each loaned to tne mu limit allowed by taw, with no power of ex pansion.” This statement contains two inaccura cies: 1. The notes issued by the govern ment amount to $141,000,000, instead of $ 111)0,000,000. 2. There has boon a con traction, daring the year, of about $8,000,- 000.

Some have offered to fix the rate of sea postage at two cents per half ounce.

Tb>s treaty will expire January 1, 1370, and such postal inter course with France will cease.

(BY TELEGRAPH.] To the Senate ani House of tUprt»sntatiees : In coming before you for the ant time u Chief Magistrate of the cation, u is with gratitude to tbe Giver of all good for the many beneati we enjoy. We are b.essed with peace at home, and are without entangling alliances abroad to forebode trouble. With a territory uninrpaned In fertmev, with an area equal to tbe abundant support of too.coo.oco people, and abounding in every variety of mend mineral id quantity sufficient to supply the wotld for generations; with luxuriant crops* with a variety of climate adapted to the produc tion of every tpeoes of earth’s riches, and suited to ibe bahiu, taster, ana requirements of every living thing; with a population or 50,000,000 of tree people; ail speaking one language, wlta facilities for every mortal to acqvtre an education • with Institutions closing to nose the avenues of fame or any blessing of fortune that mar be coveted; with fteedom or the pnlplt, the pr«*, atd tbe schools; with a revenue flowing into the TTeamiy bejond the requirements ot govern* ttent supply. Barmonv u being rapidly re stored within onr own borders; manufactures hitherto unknown in our country are springing op in an directions, producing a degree of national independence unequalled by that of any other power. These blest logs and countless others are intrusted to jour care and none for safekeeping for tbe brief period of onr tenure of office. In a short time we most each of os return to the rank* ot the peop'e who have conferred open ns our borers, and account to them for oar stewardship, 1 earnest:7 aeatre that neither yon nor I may be condemned by a free and enlightened constit uency nor by our ownlcocscieaces. Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic magnitude, aided as it was by the sympathy and assistance or Danone with whom we were at pesce, eleven mates of the Union were left four years ago with out legal State government. A deb: had been contracted; American commerce was almost driven from the sesa; the Industry of one-half the country had been taken from the contrd of the capitalist, acd placed where all labor ngntfnliy belongs. In tbe keening of tbe laborer. Tbe work ol restoring the State governments loyal to tbe Union; of protecting and fostering free labor, and providing means lor paving interest on the public debt, has received ample attention from Congress. Although your eflons nave not met with tbe suc cess in all particular* that might have been de- sired, yet, on the whole, they have been more successful ttancooid have been reasooaoly an ticipated. Seven States which passed ordinances ol teccsrlon have been fatly testored to their places inthe Union; the eighth. held an election at whten one ratified her consti i niton, republican in lotm, elected aGovernor, members of Congress. a Stale Legislature, and all ether dfficcts required; the Governor was duly installed, acd the Legislature met and performed all the nets then required of them by me Becon* ttraction acts uf congress. Sanaequenuy, oow cver, in violation of tbc cocstitatlon whicn they bad just reused, oa since decided by the Supreme Conn of the State, they unseated the colored members of ibe Legislature, and admitted some member* who lie duquallfled by the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitn* uco, an article which they themselves hod con* tnbated to ratify. Under these circumstances, 1 would submit to you whether it would not be wise, without delay, to pots a law authorizing the Gov* error ot Georgia to convene toe members origin* ally elected to tec l>gl:latnre, requiring each member to take the oatb prescribed t>y tbe Recon struction act, and soce to be admtued wto are ineligible neder the third clause of ths Fourteenth Ameccmetu ns FssxmrsK, under the protection which they have received, arc making rapid progress In learning, and no coisp'aiEta are beard of alack ot industry on ihftr part, when they receive fair remuneration lor tbelr labor.

It mikes the aau oi business an involuntary gain bier, for In all sales where fatore payment la to be trade, both parties speculate as to what wQI be the value of the currency to be paid and re ceived. 1 earnestly recommend to jou, then, poeb legislations* will insure a gradual return to ipem payment?, and put an immediate stop to me fluctuaiirn m tie value or currency. The teetheds to secure these results areas numerous as are the speculators on political economy. To k cure the latter 1 tee but one way, and that la to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presetted: to withhold from cremation all such currency redeemed until told again for cold.

Ter byieartheabmtj to pay Increases in a rapid ratio, bot the burden or interest ought to be reduced ns rapljtr as can be done without the violation of contract.

It Is Believed mat wl which arc now doe may be replaced by l«cd* beanos a rate of interest tot exceeding 4* per cent, and, as rap idly ss the remsiedtr become Car, mat they may be replaced In the same way. To accomplish this It may be necessary toso'horre me Interest to be paid at either ui three or lour of the mosey cnies of Kurope or by any Assistant Treasurer of the Catted States, at the option of the bolder of tre bond. I suggest this subject for the consider- SHOP of Congress.

The subject ot the tariff and internal taxation will necesanUy receive your attention. The reve nue ol the countrv are greater than the require ments, and may, wl'bsaicty, be reduced; but ns the funding of toe debt on a four, or a lour and a half percent, would reduce the annual expenses largely, thus, after funding, Justifying a greater reduceoo of taxation than would be now expedi ent,! suggest the postpor cment of thU question unto the next meeting of Congress, when tt may be advisable not only to codify taxation and tartif in IE nan ccs where unjust or burdensome disctlml* natiota are made by the prevent lawn, but to make a general revision of the laws regult'log this so> jtcr. I therefore recommend iu postponement (cr the present. I also anggevt the renewal of the tax on income?, bat at a reduced rate, say, of three per cent, ana this rax to expire in three years. vVitb the rending of the national debt as here sug gested, 1 reel safe in raying the taxes and revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and be s*m further reduced from year to year, aa the resources or the country are developed. yiXAXCIAL statistics.

Believing that a convention, thus miscon ceived in its scope and to provisions, would not have produced the hearty, cordial settlement of tbe penning questions which alone la ooas latent with tbe relations which I desire to hive established between tbe United States ard Great Britain. 1 regarded the action of the berate to rejecting the treaty to have been wisely taken in the interest of peace, and os a necessary attp in the direction of a perfect and cordial frie td*htp between the two countries.

The practical working of this asserted snptrvtsjty control over the dolors of the Coamheiyoer has bees, upon the whole, injurious. Consistency of decisions aid of administration has not been attained.

Diligent effort Is be ing made to bring the offenders to Jus tice, but the mode of appointing and paying Pension Agents and Medical Examiners ahoald be changed, niiit a view to increasing tneir effl* as aids to the office In protecting the gov ernment against fraudulent claims* The Pension Agents are now entitled to a per centage upon the amount ot money disbursed by them. In my Judgment this Is the exact oppos te of the tine rule in tcch casern The government may he benefited by paying collecting officers a percentage on teem collections, smee their vg ihu.ee Is eliminated in that way; oat to increase the officer's compensation tn the ratio of the amount disbarred, is to make it hla interest to be bind to frauds which tend to increase the pay ments to be made by him. and his own consequent profit, laouid recommend, therefore, that the salaries of the several pension agents he llxed at the amount actually pstd them during the pate fis cal year, and that toe sliding scale, dependent up on dUbumments, be abolished. Under the present laws examining surgeons ore appointed from the medical men resident in the vartoos districts of the country. They examine the applicants for pension in their own neighbor hood. such applicants paying the fee therefor, which is repaid to the applicant if the pension is finally granted. Under this rule the feelings of good neighborhood, the disposition to favor a friend, ana tee desire to extend bts own practice by increasing bis popularity, ail tempt the exam iner to be isx, ana mere is conclusive evidence mat such laxity ha's greatly and improp erly increased the pension- roll, andthe consequent burdens of taxation. I therefore recommend mat a rofficient number of medical officers be perma nently attached to the Pension Office, to mate me required exam matrons of invalid pensioners as well as cf applicants for Invalid pensions, or aa inerrate of rate, and that the fees now paid for tnch examinations be turned into a fund tor pay ing proper slants to such Medical Examiners.

Tte completion of one of ttie great lines of ralU war to ibe Pacific eoass baa teta'ir cheoged the co&diDODS under wblcb tbe clriltzed population of the country corns to contact with the wild tribes. Instead of a slowly advancing tide of migration, mating its gradual to roads upon tbe circnmfer- esce cl Ue great inferior wilderness, tbe very 1 centre of tbe detert has been pierced. Every na- ! lien upon the railway has become a nucleus tor a Utilized settlement, and a base from which imea 1 cf exploration for octb mineral and agricultural aealib are pu-bed to every direction,- luily trains ue cairytr g tbootaods of our atlseos and untold valnea of merchandise across tbe continent, and moat te protected from tbe danger ol bating boa* uie trines on either aide ot tbe note. Tbe range of tbe buffalo is being rapid.y restricted, and tne chase Is becoming sn uncertain reliance to tbe iruv.an (or tbe sssrenaoee ol b!a famtiv. Ii be la ta tract te mu rub, as white men do In the like drccmstinces, ana robbery is bat tbe be ginning of war, tn vblcb savage bartiariUea aod retaliations toon came a cry ot extermination to be raised along tbe whole frontier. It bas long been tbe policy of tne government to require cl tbe tribes most nearly in contact with wbue settlements that tbey should Ox their abode upon definite reservations, and abandon the wan- Cenagioeto which tbey bad been accustomed. TO encourage them in ctvfUzation, large expend!* tmts have been made in (ntaahlsg them with tbe means of agriculture and with clouting adapted to thrit new mode 01 life. Anew pohej la notsomuch needed as ca en larged and more enlightened application ot the general principles 01 the old one. We arc now m ecs tact with all tbe aborlgloal tribes withm our borders, and can no longer amine that we may. even for atiine, leave a large part of them out of the operations of onr system. 1 understand this policy to look to two objects: First the location 01 the Indians upon fixed ressr vatlots, so that the pioneers and settlers msybe freed horn the terrors of wandering hostile trues; and. second, aa earnest effort at tbelr civilization, so that tbey may themselves be elevated m the scale of humanity, and onr obligation to them as lenowmen may be discharged. in carryug out this policy a great practical dif ficulty has amen from the lent that m most in stance* a separate reservation was given to each tribe. These reservattgns have been surrounded andfiradnaSpinvaded sg the white settlement! the Indians crowded out of tbotr hoses and forced to negotiate for a new settlement, became their presence, thetr habits, and tbeir manners were distasteful to new and more powerful neighbors. . It la believed tb&t the only remedy for this con dition ot things Is to encourage tne Indians to as * 'k tofiie Hi on'lanrr Tevervattonar-where thetr. 1 bqq beta >w te • and where the cjtrs drctzed o! them will inflame* the otter* (a striving to progress IQ the sns ot peace. Congress has already r m ”*** so act to enable the civilised of the Indlsn Territory, property so caned, to form a general organization, with most of the elements ol a Territorial Government; bat there* aatiite appropriations ot money bare net been made to carry Ura plan Intoeffeow J would esrp eitly recommend vast no funner delay be made in this : too associated tribes, of which the Cherokee* have taken the lead, ate those best sued lor a toilet experiment to self-government. They are already familiar with most of the forms of executive, legislative, sad Judicial actum in ok among nr, and I believe them well prepared to dhpessewiththetouisceof oar agents, if they mry have a Delegate ol thetr own upon the floe* of theOooie of BepreventaUvegta apeak for them. Both they and we are suffering for the lack of such direct rtpresentation. The whitaeonstltaca cica which are nearest to them are the ones of al* the nation whose interests are meat in opposi tion, and whose personal tendencies are most hostile to them*. The representatives of such ccnatitoeeales wools be more than human if ther were not mdoenced by this fact. Representation chosen try the tribes tftemerlvrs, and responsible totfcetreelte*, is the cnirmode of meting toe country acquainted with their coMUloo and with cor obligations to them. Is inch a Territory tho mbs! organization would easily merge into the comity, and me Territorial Legislature would cot be vciv different from the grand councils as prevent m rogue among them. The Indians north of the Flttte River are not jet prepared tor a similar concentration; not tho time cannot be far distant when two of the pitn cipsllndmn Territories itsy properly embrace all the tribes east ot the Rocky Mountain o . Without suchasjucrj they will titrltibij go through too old process of being tirst surrounded and then overwhelmed and destroyed by the white immi grautn. As thev advance In intelligence they wld need no urgmg to adopt mis plan, tortney vU see us piauly as we that the existence of tholr race cepe ads upon It. TbeesmepoPcyofconceotratlcffthe tribes will apply to the country west of the Rocky Mono tains, and will be eqnalty necessary whenever sod wherever the lends existing among them can be so tor settled tbatthey can lire together la peaceful tcighbortood. Upon such permanent reserva tion?, farms ahouiu be allotted in soveraity as soon as any elf position to agriculture Is awakened, aid every iDoncement offered to stiomlate the de sire for proceny ol a flxea character. The late Peace Commitslon negotiated treaties , wKhall the principal tribes cast of the Rocky Mountain*, and were guided In thetr actionoy the gecerul views ststed above, which, indeed, may Le said to have been accepted by all disinterested partita who have Cad any opportunity or examin ing the subject.

CIVIL JEftVICC. My predecessor remarked iu hti report for 1355: “No otc, with the least experience tu on execu tive department can, 1 believe, avoid the conclu sion that Its efficiency would be largely promoted by a radical change in the ctgaulzat 00 ol its clef leal lerct;" and, in that fer *• 1; is my set tled opimor, the result of much reflccuou, atd of experience m m> prerent position. rim the ef ficiency of the clerical force would t>e ts«cntuTy promoted by thcronghiy recrgsuittng it.*' lie added: “It u hoped that a subject of to muca to portancc to the sncceatfoi working or the ex ecutive deportments will receive tie coastdexatloa it so well merlm.'* I fully concur in the opinion*, and nolle in the hope oe expressed. The Orac mcaimo of tvlorm u to raise taeatebdud of qcaiiflcatlou, make merit as tested by the duty performed the sole groand of promotion, and se cure to the faithful incumbent the same persu atnceol employment il-at tsgjvea to officers of the army and navy. Fcrter me present system, the gentrai couvictma amouz the cierss acd employes is that the retention or their places d* rends mnch tcoie npot> the political UCattce they caa comoaud, than, upen energy cr zeal in tte rcrforuasce ofdatr- A'ter a careful exumluaitoa of the subject, lam tally yet stud* d tha* 17 e meaiurc I hive sugztatcrt would have tnabted this de;artmcsi Co do the wotk of the past B-cal year, with a or cleisv, o&e-tUlnJ less in luzber we lound reo ssary. special rcowledgc and skd' are indis pe: sable fc> the proper pt-rfonracce ol much of iceclenc-.llaborof moaiol iheburtau?, and can only be acquired In Urni aud with great labor.

Abezptriccced clerk la a repository of tr.e law, the history and the tndifoas of the depart ment, acd m:y olten. t>y a werd of suggestion, ex pose a mud, which might otherslac escapo unnoticed, mairate an important fact of which there la cu record, or in a luousand ways save rus aopenor from impotUion or iroru a long and labo rious mvtatlgatioD. Vet scca ts the singular anomaly of oursysrem, that the very fact that a man b&o been rctameu tu place denog a chango of administrations baa been commonly held to be a sufficient political reason for demanding bis re moval. My own conviction is very strung, that the* advantages supposed to be gained In this way are at. unreal and oelctlte a* the mLcblefj are anb ata&tisl and certain. The evil does not ttop with the increased coat and dioucisbed value of rbe clerical labor It lelf. it haa given rise to a practice of office-seek ing, which goes far to prevent the p«oncr per formance ol their duties, by the highest officers of the government. During the firs; three nontha alter the inauguration of a new President, nearly the whole time ot his confidential advisers u oc cupied by applications tor office, and tt is impos sible, euner before or alter the ordinary business hours, to get sufficient time for the careful study of the larger duties pertaining to the depart ments, cr of questions of pubdc interest. Trto deuces u»ed by apnocants to obtain as audience nake it impossible to discriminate between those who have important public business to transact and tbuse who have not. Toe only mode of re lief Is to ohsnge, entirely, the tables of easy ac cess- which ought to auk all offloera ot the re public, and tnu, of ttteii, shows me necessity of a reform. theoretically it would seem that the remedy is m the hands ul the executive and depailm*nlal officers: cnr. practical!*, tee'custom has become £0 firmly established, that members of Congress are forced to 5 icld to the Imponunr.y of their con stituents, and are unable to set relief except by urging uppoiou&eLifi and removals upon toe ex ecutive departments, ihos public business is most seriously embarrassed ar»i retarded, and changes are sometimes made, because in that way alone does it seem possible 10 get room for the ordinary action ottha administrative machinery, la this matter, the mu tom established for forty years has so much the effect of law, that so remedy seems adequate except to give permanence to the suo , cremate branches of the civil service by legltla non, making capacity and integrity the sole teats ot the flttesa ot the applicant, and throwing com petition open to ad. If there were no hope for speedy legislative action, 1 am well aware toat this statement would be a useless display of an unpleasant subject; bat the fact mat public ar.et.non is already directed to It, and that measure* are pending in Congress, designed to cure the acknowledged enU seems to make an unreserved .declaration of the truth a public only. 1 am, am, very respectfully, your cbedleat servant, J.
