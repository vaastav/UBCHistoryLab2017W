IT'S UNDER WAY NOW aills M Isoeltioms An ing In froimed Right and Wl MONROE DOCTRINE AGAIN Cuba Will Aleo Form a Popular Subject for Debate in Both Houeee of Congrees Soon. Washington, Dec. 3.-The session of the house to-day was very brief and was consumed entirely by the reading of the president's message. It was listened to with lair attention, but the features of the document received no sign, either of approval or disapproval from the members until the conclusion of the reading, when sevesal democrats created a slight demonstration. When it was finished the house immediately adjourned until Friday. The first movement in congress upon the Venezuelan boundary dispute came to-day in the form of a resolution in troduced in the house by Representa tive Livingston of Georgia. The reso lution recites that by a resolutlon of the last congress it was recommended that the boundary dispute be submit ted to arbitration, that the action was brought to the attention of her Britan nia majesty's government by the presi dent courteously and with kindly in tent, and declares that her majesty's government "has failed to give the prompt consideration to the important request contained in that joint reso lution or to answer the same in any manner, such as was due and becom ing to the dignity of the United States as a great nation and to the friendly relations existing between the two governments." The resolution eio recited that after this communication, the cdlonlal secrea tary instructed the government of Brit ish Guiana to take forcible possession of certain territory of Venezuela In volved in the dispute, an act which has been officially declared to be the manifestation of an unfriendly disposi tion towtard the United States In conclusion it provides for a joint committee of two senators and three members to investigate the facts and recommend proper action to congress, to vindicate and preserve the dignity and rights of the United States in the premises. Among the bills introduced were the following: By Mr. Wilson of Ohio-To equalize pensions on account of ser vice fn the Mexican war. McMahon of Pensyl vania-Incorporating the Mari time Canal Company of Nicaragua. Byi Mr. Herrmann of Oregon-To abro gate the Clayton-Bulwer treaty. By Representative Johnson of California To provide that no alien shall be ad mitted to citizenship who has not for the continued term of five years pre ceding his admission, resided within the United States and who cannot speak and write the English language. 

DOWN TO BUSINLSS. In the SOnate the Monroe Doctrine and Cuba Are Mentlomed. Washington, Dec. 2.-The senate plunged into real business to-day. Naturally, the president's message at tracted the main attention of the day, but aside from this there were stirring resolution. on the Monroe doctrine and 4the Cuban rebellion, and after that the usual deluge of bills and resolu tions, running far up into the hun dreds. The message was given the closest attention from all quarters of the chamber. At its conclusion Mr. Lodge of Massachusetts. offered a res olution, vigorous in terms, reaffirming the principles of the Monroe doctrine and presenting them in such a form as to permit their enactment as a per manent law, rather than an expression of the policy advocated by President Monroe. In the same line was a reso lution by Mr. Cullom, and another by Mr. Allen of Nebraska. The Cuban situation received attention from both the Florida senators The Call reso Iution will be called up to-morrow, so that Cuba and the Monroe doctrine will receive early attention. At the executive session the nominations of Mr. Olney as secretary of state and Mr. (Harmon as attorney general were con frmed. and that of Rufus H. Peckham, to the supreme bench, was referred to the judicial committee. The galleries were again well filled but there was not the struggle for places incident to the opening. After the formal proceedings. Vilas and All) son, the committee appointed to wait on the president, stepped into the mid dle aisle and Vilas said: "The presi dent desires us to convey his respectful salutations to the houses of congress and says he will immediately commu nicate his views in writing to con gress." Then Pruden, the executive clerk. made a formal transfer of the message to the senate. There was a thinning out of attendance on the floor after the first half hour of reading, as the senators had printed copies. At 1:40 p. m. the reading of the me. sage was completed and on motion of Gorman it was laid on the table and ordered printed. Cullom presented a communication from Evanston, Ill., asking the govern ment to take action concerning the de plorable condition of affairs in Turkey. Gallnger offered a similar communica tion from citizens of New Hampshire. The resolution of the Idaho legisla ture urging the election of Unites States senators by popular vote was presented by Dubolo. There was a ripple of laughter as Mr. Stewart of Nevada reintroduced his time-honored bill for the free and unl.mited coinage of silver. Mr. Call, democrat. Florida, gave notice that be would call up >b' s reolution to-morrow Mr. Cages. re publiean. Illinois, iatreaget a SgIl tion on the Monroe dootrasm shaber to that presented by Mr. LedWg ne save notice that be would rea A the resolution as soon as permissIet for the purpose of addressiag the iate thersoL .enater Lodge of Mamn5Kin todey introduced the followiag ipseli tion relative to the Moaroe deetrite: "That the congress or the Vanted State. deem it proper to assert, as the principle In whiob the rights sand a tereets of the United State. are la volved. that Americaa continents, by the free and independent cosdition which they have assumed and main tained, are henceforth not to be msa sinered as subjects for future esteli sation by any European powere. "Reeslved. That we should eeag~sr any attempt on their part to emtead their system to any portion at dis hemisphere as deagerous to our peace and safety. With the existing soo nles or dependencies of any European power we have not Interfered sad shall not Interfere, but with govern ments who have declared their lade pendence and maintained it and whose independence we have, on great se - sideration and on just principles, ank nowledged we could not view any la terposition for the purpose of oppress Ing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power, in any other light than as a manifestation of unfriendly disposi tion towards the United States. "Res4Aved. That in accordance with the doctrine laid down by President Monroe. as stated in the preceding res olutions. the United States declares it proposes to maintain the principles embodied in that doctrine, and will regard any infringement of it or any attempt on the part of any European Gower to take or acquire new territory on the American continent, whether under pretense of boundary disputes or otherwise, as an act of hostility to the United States. "Resolved. That the president be re quested to communicate these resols tions to the governments of all na tions with whom we have relations of amity and commerce. Senator Cullom, republican, Illanois, also introduced a resolution enunotat ing the Mlonroe doctrine. It is as fol lows: "Resolved, That the policy proclal ed by President Monroe, and since known as the Monroe doctrine, is by precedent and tradition the recognised, rightful policy of the United States, and this government will regard tbe establishment by any European ýg't of any colonial dependency or of protectorate over any existing cis tf* ture government, or the extansion of any territorial possessions, er :he con trol or ownership of any inter-oceanic canal on the continent of Amncrw'a as a dangerous mensaº.e to the .v lfares and prosperity of the United States." Senator Call introduced the foUowing joint resolution: "Resolved. That the government of the United Stales re*ognlse a condition of public war between the g)vernm"nt of Spain and the government proclaim M and for some time maintil.i d by force of arms by the pc ple of Cuba, and the United States of America here by declare that they will maintain a condition of strict neutrally between the contending powers And accede to 4Jach all the rights of belligere.ts in the ports and territory of the United States. The congress of the United: States protests and remonstrates against 'the barbarous manner in which; the war in Cuba has been conducted, and the president is hereby authoriaed to take such steps as may be expellent in his judgment to secure an observ ance of the laws of war as recognised by civilized nations." Senator Vest re-introduced his bill of last session to prohibit monopoly in the traneportation of cattle to foreign countries, and aiso his bills for the compulsory education of Indian child ren and the settlement of private land claims. Senator Chandler re-introduced his bill for the exclusion of alien anarch Ists, and his bitt for the regulation of iummigration. The following is the tull test of Sen ator Allen's resolutlo't on the recognl tion of Cuba and the maintenance of the Monroe doctrine: "Resolved, That it is the sense of the senate: First, that the government of the United States of America should promptly recognise the revolutionists of Cuba, who are now bonestly strug sling to secure independence of the Spanish government, as composing an independent nation, possessing al the rights thereof according to the laws of nations. "Second. that al Islands to loase pros Imity to the mainland of the United States of America should as speedily as possible, by treatles of pardhase, be annexed to this goversenest as essen tial to our safety in times of war, and the convenience and necessity of other cownnerce in times of peace. '"Third, that the wise declaration of Presldoet Monroe. known as the Mon roe doctrine, is a well-estasblihed poll cy of the government of the United States and should be promptly and' effectually maintained by the govern meat In its orlgimja purity and pur e'ourtht , that while the government of the United States should net need lesaly or hastily embroil itself with any foreign power and should only resort to extreme measures In cases of ab solute necessity, a firmer sad more prompt policy on the part of the gov erament in maintalaing the rights of American cttisens abroad sbould be in troduced and pursued." Mr. Morgan. democrat. Alabama, gave notice that on next Monday he would address the senate on the Brit lah claims for Bering Sea seizures. At 2.50 o'clock the senate went into executive seeslon and at 3 o'clock ad journed. 

ENGLAND'S COMMENT S8m Parts of the masp Hit John Bhll athw Har&. ABOUT MONROE'S DOCTRINE The " Standard" Cannot But Re gret the Tone of the President's Referenoe to the Venezuelan Dispute and So On. London. Dec. =.-The newspapers to morrow will very generally contain ed. torial comments upon President Cieve land's message. The Graphic says: 'The crudities and Indisoreflons of President Cleveland's present pronun ciamento on foreign affairs might have been evolved by the late Mr. Blaine In his worst mood. Can anything be more absurd than the proposal that the Schonberg line (in Venesuela). should be submitted to arbitration? The ret erence to Cuba is infinitely more Inju dicious. It is virtually an expression of sympathy with the flHibueterers." The Times says: "President Cleve land has drawn a startlina picture of the difficulties created by the vicious currency system, and we should be greatly surprised if the plans be sug gested are not warmly welcomed by the business men throughout the states. But, flushed by electoral victories, it is probable enough that the republicans will refuse to allow anything to be done in the direction indicated." The Daily News will say: "President Cleveland knows better than to treat the Monroe doctrine as it it were a rule of international law. It is neither dig niled nor politic for the administration at Washington to take the quarrels of South American communities which do not observe the usages of civilised na tions." The Standard says: "We cannot but regret the tone of President Cleve land's references to Venezuela. If we may Judge of the tone and substance of Mr. Olney's dispatch from the para phrase thus imparted to congress, we are not surprised that no answer has been received, and we further under take to predict that when the reply reaches the white house it will furnish the president with a deal of matter for serious reflection. Even if we were eager for arbitration, the experience In the Bering sea controversy would hardly encourage us. It is not easy to argue calmly when we And that Prest 4 UNeveland has already prejudiced 1 erits df the dispute. But even ptong states have rights, and though Wreat Britain Is able to maintain its dignity and Interest, It ought not to be a mark for public affront in a presiden tial message." The Post says: "As regards Samoa and Venesuela, the message appears to te framed on lines whioh Senator' Chandler might approve. In regards to Cuba. there are similar suggestions of a disposition to conciliate the feel ings of popular agitators." THE

In conjunction with Russia and France, Germany has en deavored to prevent ftrther compilca tions threatened by war between the two great Mast Asiatic empires. Our endeavors have been attended with suc cess, thanks to the judicious modern tion displayed by the Japanese govern inent, and will contribute to preserving and enlarging the field of peaceful labor for Germany's industry and trade. The dep4oraible events in the Turkish em pire and the situation created thereby have our serious attention. Faithful to its aliances and to the tried princi pies of German policy, the empire Is ever eady to cooperate with the pow ers when called upon by their lIterests to work for the furtheranoe of the cause of peace. The unsalmity of de cislon of all the powers to respect to existing treaties and the support of the government of his majesty, the sul ta. In the establishment of an orderly state of things justifee the hope they wil not be wanting In suocess." Atte* inviting the cooperation of the relbeteg in passing the proposed civil code and series of bills Intended to promote the welfare of the Industrial classes. including the establishament of artisan chambers, the speech alludes to the proposed bourse law intended to remove, as far as possible, the influence of deahag on the bourse In affecting the prices of commodities, dangers whbicb have frequently been felt, to the detrksamt of the national well-being. Continuing, the speech says the ex pectatieo attaching to the existing su gar tax bill for the Internal abolition of export premiums has unfortunately not been realized, and In view of the uaevosable effect which the general condition of the sugar market exercises over agricauttral affairs, a strong wish has been manifested for extensive re Lorm la legislation on that subject, and this is now under consideration by the federal government.
