Washington, Dec. 8. T. n. Walker, he largest timber land holder in Mln esota and the holder of hundreds of thousands of acres of white pine lands tn Northern California, Is In Washing Ion taking the initial steps in what looks to be an amalgamation into a o-operatlve association of all the limbered lauds in this country, Cana da and Mexico. Mr. Walker denies that his scheme has anything to do with a reported merger with the Wey rhauser interests of St. Paul, thougs that merger would form, he admits, a logical beginning for the more gen eral scheme of combination. Within the last few days there has been a meeting here of Mr. Walker and Mr. McCorniick. who represents the Weyerhauser interests on the Pacific, and General Manager Illnes, who looks after the more eastern prop ertlea of the Weyerhnusers. For a number ot years, said Mr. Walker. here has been talk on the part of outside interests of promoting the merger of the two concerns already owning more than a million arms of timbered lands In Minnesota. Idaho, Wisconsin, Oregon, and California. Under the present tariff protection however. Mr. Walker declares he al ways has refused to become party to any merger. Hut the possibility of a lowering or the duty on lumber Mm feel the necessity for a c.r,.l .,iml)in;itim to which the Government shall be at least an in terested spectator, if not a real part Mr. Walker says his aim Is to avoid the necessity of cutting down the for ur. hi.i,t nurt that are held by wniii e. ......... - iii this country, nut it v. mriff Mulls are to be lowered ...., .I..,.,. .ci I,.. si!iw check nut on cut iino in Canada and Mexico.

" IKE Woodford Representative's Let ter From State Capital STRUGGLE OVER DOE BILL Mr. Bowles Has An Idea That Pub lic Utilities Bill Is Doomed to Defeat. M,intt.i.ll..r Vt Tl., K UW It seemed In a sense like home when we got back here for business this week. Hecuuse of my brother's funeral, Mon- uay, i couia noi ue present ai Mon day evening's or Tuesday's sessions. Never before have I been absent five minutes when the house wan in ses sion during my two terms in the leg islature. When I came up Tuesday I had to wait SVi hours in HurliuKton. and as the weather was fine 1 enjoyed look ing over the varied industries and large buildings of the Queen City. Just before arriving at Iturlington, and alongside the lake, a young man at my side asked me what river it was? When 1 told him It was lake Chaniplaln, he said he did not know that there was so large a stream of water in Vermont! lie was an in telligent young man, but I thought quickly that my school children knew as much about geography as he. He then told me that his home was In Philadelphia and that his sister had Just died in the Mary Fletcher hospital and that his mission to Ver mont for the lirst time was a sad :!lie. Or try arrival at the capiial Tues day i wniiig at t'.:;;i, ;i delegation of legislators headed by lepleS'lltativo l.eltay of Se;irshiirg. was in the lie pot tn meet me. The care and courtesy extended me was deeply ap preciated, and will not soon be for uotien. Nearly all the nieinbir had heard of my brother's death ln-fore my arrival, and in the mails I have re ceived letters of condolence from fib nils in lleiniitigtoii and elsewhere. It would have pleased my friends interested In (he game question to have noticed the look of earnestness and anxiety on the face of Governor I'routy during Ills two d.ivs holdup be fore signing the doe bill, which he linallv did Thursday morning. Floods of netitions from all over th state llelicv hill. that devil had been rcceiwd by his excel importuning him l veto the Kemarks were frequent l made the governor was "between the 1111,1 the lleell sea." as all klleW that he was conscientious and desirous of doing the right thing at the right time. I'nder tin- circumstances, the gover nor couldn't do otherwise unhss he was looking for trouble with the House and Senate. Had he vetoed the bill, It could lie passed over the veto hynia)ori'y action of both bran ches. The vote Wednesday, when the House refused to recall the bill from the chief magistrate, proved conclus ek that It was up to him to say yes or no. If It was a diplomat lin dodge on the part of the executive to try out the temper of the House It worked .successfully. It placed the Tespon-i I. ilii.. .1 i i ! v- mi the House. 11 body supposed to respond most readily to popular will. M. J llapgood of Peru rushed in to see the governor to per suade him not to sign the bill, but was too late, although the Ink of the gov ernor's signature was not y t dry when M. J. arrived. Mr. Ilapgood felt aggrieved and almost wept aloud. Senator Orvis of .Manchester, chair man of the committee on llsh and game was the hcavlcht factor In sup port of the bill, and it was largely through his night and day wotk. com bined With the efforts of Representa tive Howe of Itennlnglon, that the bill was passed The cattle tuberculosis quest ion was before the House as a committee of the whole Wednesday afternoon, nnd during the time Cattle Com missioner Wlllson of Arlington was on the rack he was given several arithmetical problems to solve, and some In which logarithms w.re use less, especially the one In which he was asked by Representative Martin ef lltookline to tell how long the at -tie In his opinion, would h ive lived If thev had Hot been killed I told Mr. Wlllson afterwards that I had heard a good many witnesses ex.imoi I nnd cross questioned In count nut, but for him to I"' 'lie target tor - ., ., , t ..,l...ci I,, len t a house tun 01 . 1 1 their luqnlrb s at 1,1m. some of whom evidently likened Mr. Wlllson to a live squirrel In a cat s inoinn. must have mud.' him feel quite uncomio i- nble at times.

SMALLPOX CONCITIONS BETTER People and Doctors of Brattleboro Are Encouraged Over Outlook. Hrattleboro, Dec. 8 The health officers and people generally are much encouraged over the situation with respect to smallpox. No new case in a new point has been reported since Wednesday, and there have been but three new cases In places previously umb-r quarantine. The number of pa tients at the Isolation hospital re mains at twelve, where it was a week ago. Some of those will be released this week. All the patients are doing well. The Infant sen of Mr .and Mrs. Itert Crouch, concerning whom some anx iety was felt, has passed the danger point and is expected to recover. None of the other patients has been Heriously 111. At no time has the situ tion In Hrattleboro been as serious as the mention of the disease has led people to believe. Outside people are much more scared about It than the home people are. Five cases are reported by Br. II. n. Holton in the family of Herbert Parsons a Hawsonvllle farmer. The Jamaica and South Londonderry phy sicians do not agree with Doctor Hol ton In the diagnosis. 8H0RT EVENING SESSIONS Both Houses of Legislature Convene After Sunday Recess Montpeller, Dec. 8. There were ful ly 175 members in the House and IS in the Senate when the two houses of the General Assembly convened last evening after the week-end recess. The sessions both lasted about an hour. The House killed both bills, S. 71 and II. ir.r, relating to the cutting down of witness fees from $2 to $1 and allowing six cents mileage, by nn emphatic vote, the two measures be ing much alike in their provisions. The Senate on account of the ab sence of many senators, who had not returned from their homes when the sessions opened, ordered the bill to pav certain printers the sums named, to lie. This Is the bill over which there has been so much controversy, and which the Senate committee re stored to the original figures after House had cut tin sums named on reeoiniiH sloiicr I 'iidation .anglcy. of Printing Conimls "muddy Mings" at one another by the discussers, and at certain state news papers. There was a general feeling growing against the bill before that big meeting, and since then the anti pathy has increased, so that such statements as. "we are afraid of it." and "'tis the better way to let each Concern run its own affairs." at'" fre quently heard. If "straws tell which way the wind blows," it Is safe before hand to conclude thai the "utility bill" Is doomed fi r defeat. And at this writing "the Hermit" is of the opinion that it ought to be killed. The main object to some projects is innslly lor the "plums" there are in 'hem; tjuite a number of names have been mentioned as prospective can didates for governor in r.M'l, but no name would take better, with a grow ing tendency throughout our com monwenlth for that exalted .osiion than that of Hon Joseph A. le!oer.

M Xo LIBEL SUIIS W CMIALJTORY Trouble Ahead for Indianapolis and New York Papers NO RAKE-OFF IN PURCHASE Records, It Is Claimed, Show Every Dollar of $40,000,000 Was Paid to France. Washington. D. C, Dec. 8. Sensa tional developments may follow Presi dent Roosevelt's denunciation of Dela van Smith, proprietor of the Indianap olis News, for hla editorial on the al leged scandal in connection with the purchase of the Panama canal. That editorial was based on an article print ed in a New York paper and furnished by it for simultaneous publication in a number of papers, of which the In dianapolis News was one. The article brought forward the np. nes of Douglas Robinson, brother-ir.-law of President Roosevelt, and Charles P. Taft, brother of the President-elect, as having been members of a syndicate that it was alleged se cured assess Ion of the Panama prop erty at a low figure, and uon the sale to the United States for 

$10,COO.(IUO pocketed the difference. The story was originally offered to Chairman Mack of the Democratic na tional committee for campaign pur poses, who after nn investigation by a sub-committee consisting of Senator Culberson, Josiah Qulncy and other members of the Democratic advisory committee declined to accept It. Now, it is said, libel suits are likely to be brought against every paper that published the article. It Is declared that the most absolute proof exists in the shape of the records ol the French courts, that there was no American syndicate participating In the sale of the canal. The full amount of the purchase price. tlil.ono.iMa), was paid into the hands of the French courts for dls tribution to the stockholders of the old and new French ratiania Canal companies. That distribution is still in progress. In the lapse of years, through the death of original stock holders, the subsequent division of their holdings among heirs, many of the claims are small. Distribution has been made, it Is declared, to over I'.Mi.niMl persons, the largest amount being about Il'imi.uihi, and ranging from that down to one franc twenty cents. The disbursements, however small, have been and are being made only on the order of the French courts and every one Is a matter of record There Is still on hand about Ii'imi.himi. ! tie1 claims to which are under Investi ! l-atinii uhile nlhci iiftssilil,. heirs nre being sought. It will be shown, it Is claimed, that the full amount of $n. una, iino, less the cost of distribution, is being paid to the French stock ' holders or their estates.
