The full text of President Wilson's .message read in person to members of the Senate and House in the Hall of Representatives-today, follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: Since I last had. the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union, the war of nations" on.the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportipns, has ex tended its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and reconstruction such as statesmen and people have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart, studiously neutral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have brought the conflict on; it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a limit should be set to' the sweep of destructive war and that some part of theTgreat family of nations should keep the processes of peace alive, if only to prevent collective economic ruin and the breakdown throughout the world of the industries by which its populations are fed and sus tained. It was manifestly the duty of the self-governed nations of this hemisphere to redress, if possible, the balance of economic loss and confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day of readjustment and' recuperation, we earnestly hope arid be lieve that they can be of infinite service. In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate life and their habitual detachment from the politics of Eu rope, but also by a clear perception of international duty, the States of America have become conscious of a new and more vital com munity of interest and moral partnership in affairs, more clearly con scious of the many common sympathies and interests and duties which bid them stand together. ' ALL 

AMERICAN NATIONS ON EQUAL FOOTING. particular matter that 11m at the very front of my whole thought as 1 ad dress" "you today. I mean national ae- fense. People of America Have Genius For Peace No one who really comprwiier)di the. spirit-of tho great people for whom wo are, appointed to speak .can tall to per ceive that their passion la (or peace, their jrenlus beat displayed In tho prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are. not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war. Their thought la of Individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and trie uncensored thought that quickens It. Conquest and dominion aro not In our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. Hut lust becauso we demand unmolested develop ment and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own prin ciples of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever Quarter It mav come. the aggression wo ourselves will not practtoe. We Insist unon security In prosecuting our self-chosen lines of no tlonal development. We do more than that. Wo demand It also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty and free national de velopment to the incidents and move ments of affairs which affect only our selves: We feel It wherever there Is a. people that tries to walk In these diffi cult paths of Independence and right. I rom the first' we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side of the sea, and have deemed it la Important that our neighbors nnouia. oe tree xrom all outside domina tion as that we ourselves should bo: nave set America, aside aa a, whole for the uses of Independent nations and po litical freemen. Out of mich thoughts grow all our policies, we regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a PfiCple against agcresslon. And wa are las fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta- mum puwor wiiuin our own nation as 01 aggression from without. Wo will not maintain a standing army except for uses which aro as necessary In times of peace' as In times of war; and we shall always see to It that our military peace establishment Is no larger than Is actually and continuously needed for the uses of days In which no enemies move Ttralnst us. But we do believe" In a body of free citizens ready and suf ficient to take care of themselves and of. the governments which thev have set up to serve them. Th nufc constitutions tnemselves wo have commanded that "the richt of the neonlc to keen and bear arms shall not be Infringed." and our confidence has been that our safety in times of dancer would lie In .the rising of the nation to take car of itself, as the farmers rose nt Lexington. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns, it is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they roust know how modern Ashling Is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render them selves Immediately available and Imme diately effective. And the Government must be their servant In th's matter,, must supply them with' the training they need to take cure of themselves and of it. The military arm of their Government. Which thev will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serVa them and make their Indepen dence secure-T-and not their own-Jnde-peudence merely but the rights nlso of those with whom they have made com mon cause, should tney auo do put in Jeopardy. They must he nttfd 10 way the great roie :n tnr worm, ana variivu larly In this hemisphere, for which they are qualified by principle and by chas tened ambition to play. Pan-Americanism Is Defined fey President the states of Ameri ca have 'become conscious Tot a new and more vital community.' of interest and moral partnership in. affairs, ,more clearly conscious of the many common sympa thies and interests' and duties which bid them stand together. We still mean always to make a common cause of national Independence and of politi cal liberty in Ameriqa. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we havo benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. But we have it least proved that we will not take advantage of Jier in her distress. ' the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating friends. This is Pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. From the Presidents Message read to Congress today. called economlo protection. It la high time wo repaired our mistake and re sumed our commercial Independence on the- seas. United States Must Be Jte Ovyn Carrier There was a time in thearly days of our own great nation and the republics fighting their way to Independence In Central and South America when the Government of the United States looked upon Itself as In some sort the guard Ian of the republics to the south of her as against any encroachments or ef forts at political control from the other side of x the water; felt It Us duty to play the part even without invitation from them; and I think that we can Claim that the task was undertaken with a true and disinterested enthu siasm for the freedom of the Americas and the unmolested self-government of her Independent peoples. But It was always difficult to maintain such a role without offense to the pride of the peoples whose freedom of action we fought to protect, and without provok ing serious misconceptions of our mo tives, and every thoughtful man of af fairs must welcome the altered circum stances of the new day in whose light we' now stand, when there is no claim of. guardianship or thought of wards but, instead, a full and honorable asso ciation as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, in the Interest of all America, north and south. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of tho states, of Central and South America la not altered. We retain unabated the spirit that has inspired us throughout the whole life of our Government and Which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean al ways to make a common cause of na tional Independence and of political lib erty In America. But that purpose is now better understood so far as it con vents ourselves. It is known not to be a selfish purpose. It Is known to have In It no thought or taking advantage of any government In this hemisphere or playing Its political fortunes for our own benefit. All the governments of America stand, jo far as we are con cerned, upon a footing of genuine equal ity and unquestioned Independence. W c have been put to the te,st In the rase of Mexico, snd we have stood tho tent. Whether we have heneflted "Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hnhrts. Jtut we have at least, proved that we will not tako advantage of her in her distress and undertake to impose upon her an order and govern ment of our own choosing. Liberty is vCften a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set, and to which no bounds of a few men's ehoos lnT ought ever to be set. Every Amerl o&n who has drunk at the .true foun tains of principle and tradition must subscribe without reservation to the hldi doctrine of the Virginia Bill of Right., which in the great days in which our Government was set up was everywhere amongst us arcented as the creed of Tree men. Tnsi aocinne . "That government Is. or ought Nto be, Instituted for the common bener.t, pro tection, and security of the neople. na tion, or community." that "of all the ynrlous modes and forms of govern ment, that 4s the best which Is capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, nnd Is most ef fectuallv secured ngainst the danger of maladministration: and that, when any government shall be found Inadequate nr contrary to these purposes, a mi- Jcrltv of the omnunltv Uath an Indii hltaht". ins lien P-e, wir. such manner as shall he Indeed most conducive to the public weal." We' Urges Approval of Defense Program have unhesitatingly applied that heroicN aleps. and they seem to me for the nrlnclnltv tt.a tfaA t V..t.n Mn r- " . now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled renubllc. which had so much of which to purco Itself, and so little sympathy from any outmde quarter in tho radical but necessary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, tut we will not corece her; and nr.r course with r:ard to her ought to be sufficient proof toall America that we seek' no political suzerainty or selfsh control. Republics Friends, Not Hostile Rivals It Is with these Ideals In mind that the plabs of the Department of War for more adequate national defense were conceived which wilt bo laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and dlsoussed. They seem to me the essential first The moral is. that tho states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-opera-tlnu friends, and that their growing sense of community of interest, alike In matters political and in matters eco nomic, is llkelv to give them a new significance na factors in International affairs unci In the political hUtdry of the world. It present them as In a very deep and true sense a unit In A'orld affairs, spiritual partners, standing to gether because thinking together, quick wun common sympathies and common Ideals. Separated thoy are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hostile rivalries: united in spirit and purpose they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful Ues- 1111V. TJ his Is Pan-Amerlcanlsm. It has none of the spirit of emDlre in it. It Is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. M very notable body of men recently met In the city of Washington, at the invitation and oe the guests of this Government, Vhose deliberations are llkelv to be looked back to as markinir La memorable turning point in the his tory or America. Tney were represen tative spokesmen of the several Inde pendent states of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of the repub lics of the two continents which nature and political fortune have so intimately linked together. I earnestly recommend to your perusal the reports of their proceedings- and of the actions of their committees. You will get from them, I think, a freslf conception of the base and Intelligent and advantage with which Americans of both continents may draw together in practical co operation and of what the material foundations of this hopeful partnership should build them and of how necessary, It is that wo should hasten their build ing. There Is. T venture in nnlnt nut nn a. peclat significance Just now attaching to this whole matter of drawing the American together in bonds or honor able partnership and mutual advantage because of the economlo readjustments wiuch me woria must inevitably wit ness within the next generation, when peaco shall have at last resumed its healthful tasks. In the performance of these tasks I believe the Americas to be destined to play their parts togeth er, i am Interested to fix your at tention on this prospect now because unless you take It within your view nnd nermtt the full significance of It to vm. Indefeasible mand your thought I cannot find the nresent sufficient. They contemplate an Increase of the standing force ot the regular army from its present strength of rive thousand and-fwepty three officers and one hun dred and two thousand nine hundred and eighty-five enlisted men of all serv ices to a strength of seven thousund one hundred and t h'rty-slx officers and one hundred and till ity -four thousand seven hundred and seven enlisted men, or 141,843, all told, all services, rank, Hie, by the addition of fifty-two com panies of coast artillery, fifteen compa nies of engineers, ten regiments rf in fantry, four regiments of field artillery, and four aero squadrons, besides ueven hundred and fifty officers required for a sreat variety or cxtrn service, espe cially the all important duty of training the cltlren forco of which I shall pre sently speak, teven hundred and nmcty two noncbmmlssloned officers for serv ice In drill, 'recruiting and the like, and tho' necessary quota of enlisted men for the Quartermaster Corns, the Ilpspltal Corps, the Ordnunco Department, and other similar auxiliary services. Those are the additions necessary to render the army adequate for Its present du ties, duties whlchjt has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army nnata hut nlcn In the PhillDlllnrs. ill tht Hawaiian Island, at the Isthmus, and in Porto Rico. . T.. .., M mnlilt.iv tli ennntru Tmnir to ssert some part of Us real power promptly and upon a large wcale, should occasion arise, tho rlnn also conterri plates supplementing th nrmv bv a force of four hundred thousand dlscl niini Htironn fftineii In increments of one hundred and thirty-three thousand 'a year throughout a period of hree tlon for defense seems to me to be ab solutely imperative now. We cannot do Uss. , Tho program which will be laid be fore you by the Secretary of the Navy Is similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out: but it does moke definite and explicit a urogram which has heretofore been only lmollclt. held in the minds of the Committees on Naval Affairs and dis closed In the debates of the two houses but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will be to the' advantage of the coun try ror tne congress to aaopi a com prehensive ulnn., for nuttlnr tho navy upon a final footing of strength and ef fltclcncv and to oress that plan to comt nletlon within the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense: we have always seen It to be oilr manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating,, a navy which now ranks very high Indeed among the navies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely determine how we shall complete what we have begun, and how soon. The urogram to be laid before you. contemplates the construction within five vears of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eightv-flve coast submarines, fpur gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction or two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destrovers. five fleet submarines, twentv-five coast submarines, two gun boats, and one hospital ship: the sec ond year, two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet sub marinds. fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship: the third year, two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five de strovers. two fleet submarines, and fif teen coast submarines: the fourth year, two battleships, two battle cruisers, two' -scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition ship, and one fuel oil ship; and the fifth vear, two battle ships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair shin. For it is a question of lndeponJ enoe. If other nations so to war or seek to hamper each ohter's com merce, our merchants, it seems, are at tneir mercy, to do with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them as they determine. We have not ships enough for our own. We cannot han dle our own commerce on the seas. Our independence la provincial, and is only on land and within our own borders. We are not likely to be per mitted to use even the ships of other nations In rivalry of their own trade, and are without means to extenJ our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a. altu&tlbn la not to be endured. It la of capital importanco hot only that tho United States should be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy the eco nomic Independence which only an adequate merchant marine would glva it, but also that tno American hem lsphere as a whole should enjoy a like independence and self-sufficiency. If it is not to be drawn into tho tangle of European arrairs. , without ftuch independence the whole ques tion of our political unity and self determination Is very seriously clouded and complicated Indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships of our pwn not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and carrying much more; creating friendships and rendering indispens able services to all Interests on this side the water. They must move con stantly back and forth between the" Airiericas. They are tho onlyehuttlos that- can weave the delicate fabric of sympathy, comprehension, confidence. and mutual dependence in which wo wish to clothe our policy of America for Americans. ' The task of building up an ade quate merchant marine for America private capital must ultimately un dertake and achieve, as It has under taken and achieved every other Ilka task amongst us In the past, with admirable enterprise, intelligence, and vigor; and It seems to me a mani fest dictate of wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may stand In the way of this much to be desired revival of our old Indenendence and should facilitate In every possible way the building, purchase, and American registration of ships. But capital can not accomplish this great task or a sudden. It must embark upon It by degrees, as the opportunities of trade develop. Something must be done at once; done to open routes and devel op opportunities where they are an yet undeveloped; done to open the arteries of trade where the currents have not yet learned to run especial ly between the two American con tinents, where they are. singularly enough, yet to be created and quick ened; and It Is evident that only the Government can undertake such be ginnings and assume the Initial fin ancial riskH. When the risk has pass ed and private capital begins to find Its way in sufficient abundance- Intn these new channels, the Government ni) wniiuraw. out it cannot omit to begin. It should take the first steps, and should take them at once. Our goods must not He piled up at our ports and stored upon side tracks In freight cars which are dally need ed on the roads: must not be left without means of transport to any foreign quarter. We must not await the permission of foreign ship-owners and foreign governments to send them where we will. appears that the deficiency will ariso directly out of the adoption by the Congress of measures which I myself urge it to adopt. Allow me. therefore, tcr 'speak briefly ct the present state of tho Treasury and ot the fiscal problems which the next year wHl probably dla- On 'the thirtieth of Juno last (here was an available balance in the general fund of tho Treasury of 1104,170,105.78. The tntnl Mtlmated recelnta for tho year 1816, pn the assumption that .tho emergency revenue measure passed by the last Congress will not be extended hnvnnrt Ita nrennnt limit, the thlrtV-flrSt of December. 191S, and that the present duty of one cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the first of May, 19M, will be 670,J65,K0. The bal ance of Juno last and these estimated revenues come, therefore, to a grand total of $774.635,G03.78. The total esti mated disbursements for the present fiscal year, including twenty-nve mil lions for the Panama Canal, twelve millions for'prbbablo deficiency appropri ations, and fifty thousand dollars for miscellaneous debt redemptions, will be ?e 041 wi liA t.olAti In tnA eren erai fund of the Treasury will be re duced to 20,C44,605.78. The emergency revenue act, if continued beyond its present time limitation, would produce, riurlnir thn half vear then remaining. about forty-one millions. The duty of one cent per pound on sugar, if con tinued, would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after th first of Mav. about fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting together to fifty-six millions, If added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year, would yield the Treasury at the end of the year an available balance of S7ti,644,605.78. u no additional revenues requireu to carry out the program of military and naval preparation of which I have spoken, would, aa at present estimated, be for the fiscal year 1917, 03,800,000. Those figures, taken with the figures for the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our financial problem for the year 1917, Assuming that the taxes imposed by tlie emerg ency revenue act and the present duty on sugar are to be discontinued, and that the balance at. the close of the present fiscal year will be only J20,6t4, C0S.78, that the disbursements for the Panama Canal will again he about twenty-nve millions, and that .the ad ditional expenditures for the army and navy are authorised by the Congress, the deficit in the general fund of the Treasury on the thirtieth of June, 1917, will be nearly two hundred and thlrtv- five millions. To this sum at least fifty millions should be added to represent a safe working balance for the Treasury, and twelve millions to lncludo the usual deficiency estimates In 1917; and these additions would make a total deficit of some two minions, Would Crush Out All Ifyphepated Americans , 1 s I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our Government into con tempt, to destroy our indus-; tries and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their number is not great but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it necessary that we should promptly make use of pro cesses of law by which we may be purged of their cor rupt distempers. Such creatures of passion, dis loyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. From the Presidents Message read to Congress today. and other governments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been and may yrt turn out to ne. i am sorry to say that the gravest threats ngainst our nitlorial hiih.ini on nin.t,...... peace and safety have been littered it (, ....... -.

The obvious moral of the figures Is that It is a nlaln counsel nr nni(lni. to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents, and confine ourselves to tne prooiem or providing one hundred una twelve minions or new revenue ratner man two hundred and ninety seven millions. Recommends Plan to Purchase Ships $222,000,000 In Bonds Available at Present 7,500 More Sailors Asked By Daniels . With a view to meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and avail ing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present unparalleled op portunity of Unking the' two Americas together in bonds of mutual Interest anJ service, an opportunity which may never return again If we miss it now. proposals will be made to the present Congress for the purchase or construe tlon of shins to be owned and directed by the Government similar to those maoe 10 tne last congress, but modified in some essential narticuiara. I reenm- mend these proposals 'to you for your prompt acceptance witn tne more confi dence because every month that has elapsed since the former proposals were maae liar made the necessity How shall we obtain the new rev enue? We are frequently reminded that there are many millions of bond which the Treasury Is authorized under exist ing law to sell to reimburse tho .sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal. ui It is trua that bonds to tiio amount of approximately X222.000 are now available tor mat purpose. Prior to 1913 J134,631,9N) of these bonds had actually been sold to recoup the expenditures at tno Isthmus, and now constitute a considerable Item of the public debt. But I. lor one. do not believe that the people or this coun try approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrow Inc monev is short-sighted finance. It can be Justi fied only when permanent things arc to be accomplished which many gener ations will certainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a sin gle generation should pay for. The ob jects we are now proposing to upend money for cannot bo so classed, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be dono in the Interest of posterity as rreli as in our own. It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what, we are now, I nope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The Deonle of the coun try are entitled to know Just what bur dens of taxation they are to carry, and -to know from thn outset, now. Tho tflr. allot.

Evervhinpr Depends on Men's Patriotism - The Secretary of the Navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the personnel o'f the navy of 7.500 sailors, J.B0O apprentice seaman, and 1.600 ma rines. This Increase would be suffi cient to care for the ships which are to bo completed within the fiscal year 11)17 and also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships which will be completed early In 1918. It is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Naval Academy at Annapolis should be in creased by at least 300 in order that the foroe of officers should be more rap idly added to; and authority Is naked to appoint, for engineering duUes omy, approved graduates of engineering col leges, and for service in the avlaUon corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. lr this full program should be carried out we should have built or building in 1921, according to the estimates or sur vival and standards of classification followed by the general board or the department, an effeottve navy consist ing of twenty-seven battleships, of the first line, six battle cruisers, twenty nve batUeahlps of the second line, ten armored cruisers, thirteen scout cruis ers., five first class cruisers, three second class cruisers; ten third class cruisers peratlve. That need was then foreseen: It Is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade Is waiting but who can find no convey ance for their goods. I am not so much Interested in the particulars of the pro gram ns I am In taking immediate ad vantage of the great opportunity which awaits us ir we win but act in this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, and out of It should come an early solution of this pressing problem. There Is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated with the Question of national Bafety and preparation for defense. That Is onr policy toward the Philippines and the people of Porto Itlco. Our treatment of them and their attitude towards us are manifestly of the first consequence In the develonment of our duties In the world and In getting a free hand to per form those duties, vve must be free from everv unnecessary burden or em barrassment; and there is inobetterway in h clear of embafTtStsBsflt than to fulfill our promises ana vromote tho in terests of those dependent on us to the utmost. Bills for the alteration and re form of the government of the Philip nines anil for rendering fuller nolitical Justice to the people of Porto Illco were submitted to the Sixty-third Congress. They will be submitted also to you. I need not particularize their details. Tou are most of -vou already familiar with them. But I do recommend them to vour early adOntlon with tho sincere conviction that there are few measures if riestrnvsra. eJarhteen fleet submarines, vnu could adont which would more 167 coast submarines 1 monitors, servlcoably clear the way for the, great twenty gunboats, four supply ships, nr- policies by which we wish to make good, teen fuel ships, four transports, three now and always, our right to lead in en- t.nilM tn (ftrfMitA vessels, aiffht vea- mr4na rrnenrA nnd erond will and L.hl l r tnrt 1 "rr or abolish it. in light llghl In which tn set forth the It -would depend upon "tho patriotic feeling of the younger me.n of the coun try whether they responded to arch a call to service or not. it would depend Upon the patriotic spirit of the em ployers of the country whether they made It pcsslble for the younger men In their emrlnv tn resnond un der favorable conditions or not.

But armies and Instruments of war ore only part of what has to be con sidered if we are to consider the su preme matter of national self-efflciehcy and security In all Its aspects. There are other great matters which Vlll be thrust upon our attenUon whether we will or not. There Is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping Involved In this great prob lem of national adequacy. It Is neces sary for many wolghty reasons of na tional efficiency and development that .. .V.S11IH have a. crraat merchant marine. The great merchant Meet we once used to make us non. mat great body or sturdy sanors wno usen to carry our flag Into every sea, and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, wa have almost driven nut nr existence by Inexousubls neg lect and Indifference and hy a hope Istsly blind and provincial policy ef s- economlc and political freedom. Plans Involve Large Ex penditure of Money tuxatlr.n, To what soti'ces. then, shall we turn?
