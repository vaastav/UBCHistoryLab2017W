Both houses adjourned soon as the preliminaries of organ ization were concluded, out of re spect for members and officers who had died since the adjournment in August. President Taft's message came to both houses today. The senate met at 11 o'clock, an hour before the customary time, so that the mes sage might be received and read be fore proceedings are begun in the court of impeachment which is to try Judge Robert W. Archbald of the commerce court. j Former Speaker Cannon was giv-i as the. roll call proceeded. They fere Representative! Sulser. New rjoraj vox, umo; Kooinson, .Araan sas, and Hanna, North Dakota. No business was transacted in the senate, but a number of bills and resolutions were introduced in the house. . ' A joint committee was named by the two houses to notify President Taft that congress was ready to re ceive his communications. Senate Republicans held an in formal conference during the day, in an effort to solve the tangle which has presented the selection of a permanent presiding, officer of the senate. It is expected that a Repub lican caucus will be held before the end of the week, and that an effort will be made to secure enough sup port from Progressive and "lnsur- gent" Republican senators to bring about the election of Senator Gallin- ger. . Washington, Dec. S. The great Frrrlman merger created when the Union Pacific railroad company -cugai 46 per cent of the stock of tte Southern Pacific railway sys was split asunder by ths su preme court of the United States as a violation of the Sherman anti trust law. Then, with the end of the merger before It, the court sent forth its portentious declaration that "while the law may not be able to enforce competition, it can reach combinations which render compet ition impracticable.". Justice Day annoonced the unani mous opinion, of the court. The court in substance approved the minority holding of Judge Hook, that the roads were competitors and that It was just as much a violation of the law for one road to buy the controlling stock of a competitor as it was for a holding company to buy the controlling stock of two competing companies. The circuit court . for- the district of Utah was. directed to supervise the separation of the two roads af-j ter hearing, and in emergency to appoint a receiver to sell the stock. It Is the general belief here that the application 1 of the decision to the railroad situation of the country will be widespread, placing a power ful precedent in the hands of , the attorney general to prevent the con solidation of competing roads, i Justice Day in his opinion first dealt with the law in the case. Hs spoke of the Standard Oil and To bacco cases of last year as the final author?7 on the Interpretation of the Sherman anti-trust act. . He pointed to the decisions before the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, and then proceeded to apply to this, mer ger the principles discussed in de clslons. ' "We take It therefore," he said in this connection, "that it may be regarded as settled, that a comblna tion ; which places railroads engag ed In ' Interstate ' commerce in such relation as to create a single dom inating control In one corporation whereby natural and existing com petition In interstate commerce , is unduly restricted or suppressed, Is within condemnation of the act. While the law may not be able to enforce competition!, it can Teacjh combinations which rendered com' petition impracticable. 'Nor do we , think It can make any : difference tnat instead or re sorting to a holding company, as was ,done In the Northern Securities case, the controlling interest in tne stock of one ferred to the other. The domina tion', and control, and the power to suppress competition, are acquired in the one case no less than In the other', and the resulting mischief, at which the statute was aimed, is equally effective whichever form is adopted."

DOUBLE TAXATION HERINGTON PEOPLE THINK, r Herington Gets Into the Game Dr. Koons, Vice President. Dickinson is one of eight counties w' "ch has organized to secure leg islation relating . to county higx schools. As the law now stands, districts are compelled to pay a tax to support the county high school whether or not they have, pupils en rolled therein. Those ' districts which have schools of their own are therefore victims of double taxa tion. For instance, Herington has not had a pupil in the county high school at Chapman for six years but has had to pay approximately It, -100 a year to the institution in ad dition to supporting its own high school. The taxpayers naturally re sent this and are In accordance with the organizati6ii;;wichprosps'" to secure legislation ' granting the re- m m M . r S - A. 1 i celebrate the victory of women's rights by leaving seven girls while he brought only two boys.

Germany Claims to Have Found Another Cure for Tuberculosis Remember, It takes only one 4 coupon cut from the Weekly Reflector and the small sum of 98c to get a $4 New Web- 4 sterlan Dictionary at the Re- "tlector cTrlcsT ' . - ABILENE KANSAS Berlin, Dec. 2. Another alleged cure for tuberculosis has been found. Frelchrlch Franz Friedman, a Berlin physician, says that he cannot only cure tuberculosis in ev ery form, but that he can confer absolute immunity against the dis ease. His claim was made at a meet ing of the Berlin Medical society. None of the leading members of the profession as yet has committeed himself to an Indorsement of the proposed cure, but many of them have testified . to some rather re markable cures. Prof. August Bier of the University of Berlin, one of German's most widely known sur geons and physicians, speaking be fore the medical society, said: "I have sent a number of tuber-, culosis patients from my clinic to Doctor Friedmann. I must admit that I have been greatly Impressed with the results of bis treatment, although I am not yet in a position to say that it has been proved to me thai be can cure tuberculosis." Doctor Friedmann says that he has developed a variety of tubercle, bacilli which, while retaining the beneficial curative properties known since Koch's time to be present in the tubercle bacillus (antigene), are absolutely free from virulence and from the properties that cause tu berculosis. His treatment consists solely in the Injection of serum con taining these bacilli, without any kind of local or therapeutic treat ment. '
