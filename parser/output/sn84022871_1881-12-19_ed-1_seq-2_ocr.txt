Of course every President is en titled to a Cabiuet of his choice, but it is not to be - forgotten that - larger - con siderations than these that arc merely personal ! determine, in the main the construction of a Cabinet.

REDUCED TAXATION AND " THE PENSION ACT. ' There are two topics in the President's message which are closely , related, viz. : the section relating to the " reduction of taxation and that which estimates the expenditures under the Arrears of Pen-? sions'act. The latter is in substance the same with the exhibit already made by Commissioner Dudley. It is a sim ple problem of mathematics. The aver- High way Vobbery, considered as a fine art, is under review just now, because of many recent occurrences. One of the latest was the ''Conveyance." as Shake speare so neatly put3 it, Jof diamond ear rings from a lady on the threshold of her own domicile, in broad daylight, in a fashionable and well-frequented neigh hood in Brooklyn. .The delicate mani pulators hurt the lady's feelings but they abstracted the brilliant pendants without inflicting the tiniest scratch. Therejyas a policeman .on the corner but he was, as. many of them are,, too fat to have any chance of catching the skill ful youths. 1 suppose you have read Mark Twain's "Innocents Abroad." The lady was the wife of one of them. Perhaps that accounts for her misfortune. The stripiculturists have been hold ing a convention, and among their usual long-haired and objectionable doctrines, which as they unmistakeably tend to develop "cranks" and Guiteauism, gen erally might, I think, receive at least as much attention as poolrooms and faro halls. It's all very well to talk about heredity and base comparisons on the methods of breeding horses, cows, sheep and pigs, but there , are , differences , in human beings. Real scientists can't ex plain it, and don't try to, and the bogus root ought to be severely suppressed. They, haven't made any. improvements in. the good, old: way, of courtihip , and consequences. ; Good, fathers don't al ways make good sons, not by a jugfull. Bv the way. Vic Woodhull & Co. are back again, especially the Co. ., Genv. Haneock,, and a distinguished company of ordnance experts, have been examining a delighful little double-barrelled sort of Gatling gun, which fired 100 shots in 11 3-4 seconds, is small enough to put on a shelf, kept cool for a long time by about a gallon or so of wa ter. Supplied with . these as domestic conveniences any respectable household er who would keep cool, like his pocket Merrill of Swanton and others are mak ing arrangements to establish a butter and cheese factory at St. Albans point, iiear Gov. Smith's place. It is proposed to erect a factory capable of , working up the milk from six hundred cows. The St. Albans Messenger says that Col. Albert Clarke, ; formerly proprietor of that paper, hs been offered the position of managing editor of one of the Boston daily papers, but declines it, as he has found the opportunity to purchase a liter ary paper which promises to be : less la borious and more profitable. T; M. Tie rney( of St. Albans has issued a challenge in behalf of Edward Drecker of Highgate, to wrestle any man in Amer ica, collar-ahB-elbow,' at 165 pounds or under, for 250 or 500 on a side, the man especially mentioned in the challenge be ing William Johnson of New York. $100 forfeit money accompanied the challenge. iThe.

The senate, also., is now republican by a still more, precarious tenure. At each congressional election the democratic majority was reduced, until now it has disappeared. The. party made, a bad use of its power, and the people, after successive warnings, withdrew their con fidence.. The republican party, has now its turn. As,it deals wisely or reckless ly with the public interests, it will gain in strength or lose its power, over : the government The present congress promises to be more prolific in bills than any of its predecessors. Some 700 bills were placed upon the calendars of the two houses during the 4Gth congress, but on Tuesday, the first bill day in the House, 781 were introduced, while 850 were in troduced in the senate last week. The call of states for bills were not complet ed in the House, Tuesday, and will be resumed on Friday,1 and by the end of the week there will probably be as many as 2500 bills placed upon the ' calenrs of the two houses. The great 1 majority of these bills are of no national'' import ance at all, and in a great many cases they will never be 'seriously considered or serve any other purpose than lumber ing up the calendars'. ! , "Perley" describes the new. speaker as "a good specimen of the Garfield type of ; Western,,. war statesmen who have worked their own way,., up in,;the world. He is of medium hight, sturdi ly built,. with a well-shaped head, and a ruddy ; complexion,. ,not .whisky-tinted, but the hearty glow of a. genial, disposi tion, overflowing spirita and a. mind ac customed to : free utterance, -j His gray eyes twinkle and shine, Lis silvered hair carelessly thrown back from his high forehead, and he bas a full grizzly beard . in which a humming-bird might build ber nest.,;, Reared on a- farm , bis .ideas were formed by communing with nature, rather than by poring over books, and in politics as it was. in the war he means business. Mrs: Keifer and two of their children, a boy and a girl,, arrived in time .to see him elected and sworn in. the act is $1350. There are about 197,000 claims which have been or will be allowed under the act ; and these,, at an average of $1350 each, make a round sum of $260,000,000: necessary for first payments. Deducting $15,000,000 as an estimate of saving in cases where claimants die, leaving no persons enti tled to .succeed . to . their pensions, we have $236,ob6.6ooi. as the amount to be paid. But there are 38,500 cases filed since June 30 1880, and now pending. 86 per cent, of which the , President es timates will be allowed. . These . do. not involve the payment of. arrears and- are not taken into the President's estimate ; but their aggregate amount must be heavy. This enormous outlay has, as we have intimated, a very direct bear ing upon what the President has to say concerning t the reduction . of taxation. People who have been disturbed by the large excess of Government revenues over expenditures, and have been agi tated over the apprehension that we were about to ruin ourselves in a . some what novel manner, by paying our debts too rapidly, have based their arguments and their apprehensions on the existing state of things, without taking into the account the enormous : drain . upon the revenues which is to. be made ' by the payments under, . the . Pension . Act. What might be. possible, if we had. not this load .to carry, is not possible now, and the President was wise in declining to recommend any. immediate reduction in the taxes on spirits and tobacco, which yield the great . bulk of our internal revenue. The other taxes, the repeal of which he recommends, may be remitted without serious loss but these sources of revenue cannot, be safely .abridged until , the outlay called for by the Pen sions Act is met The tax is one that is borne by the customer ; it is, , in a sense,: purely a voluntary tax ; and any one who considers it onerous can release himself from - its operations by abstain ing from the: use of the articles , taxed. To remit any . considerable portion of this tax at the demand of the , whisky and' tobacco interests,,; at; a, time when we are confronted by . the ; necessity, of making enormous outlays which cannot even' as yet be accurately estimated, would be the height of folly.-r-teMrBd. The unfortunate situation of Irish af fairs does not seem to change for the better. " The popular feeling seems to be growing more and more favorable to the land act; yet'many of the people are actually intimidated from' accepting the benefits to be derived from the act, by a certain element led by" selfish and ' de singing demagogues. Whether the cpes tion of refusing to pay rent be right or wrohs it is certain that those ' who re fuse to pay rent have no right to intim idate or compel others to act with' them. If a tenant desires to pay bis rent it is a monstrous wrong for the "no rent" ele ment to attempt to prevent him by vio leuce and intimidation. It is pretty fair proof that some of the leaders of the Irish agitation are working for personal forty or fifty cows. Everything is man aged on business principles, and the re sult is he is a successful farmer. By this refrigerator process poultry can be kept sound and sweet till July, when chickens begin to' arrive in the market.
