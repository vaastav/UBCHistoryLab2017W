T'hey were first sug.ested, says the lieno Gazi tIe, by its practical vice president, Charles Crocker. but hia companions hesitated through fear of impracticabilty and expense. They are of two kinds, one with very steep roofs and the other with flat roofs. They cost per mile from $S,000 to $12,000, arnd In some places, where heavy masonry was needed, the cost reached $30,000 a mile. They are firmly constructed to support the heavy weight of snow and resist the rush of as alanches. Fire precautions are also very thorough. Corru gated plates of iron sepalate the buildings into sections, ard In the great ten-mile shed there are automatic electric fire ala ms. At the Sumlmit is an engine and tant always ready to flood the Ignited spot. These sheds shut out the view of the greet Sierras, but without them the winter travel would be Im possible. Sometimes five feet of snow falls upon them in a day, and often thirty feet lie upon the ground at one time; and In man aTE idea is beginning to dawn in many eastern people that there Is something "in a name." They discounten.sced oleomargar itie. It was a vile compound. They deter ruined to have the pure thing, and bought "creamery butter." Oleomargarine was so delusive a counterfeit that table experts could not detect it. Hence the only protec tion was to buy only from manufactureas of "creamery" butt-r. We have had some of this "creamely" butter in Montana. It was good because it was brantded "cream ery" butter and sold at a high price. But these eastern people have raised a suspicion. They have found that the "creameries" are supplied with the oleomargatine oil. They have found also that "creamery " cows ate producing as high as forty pounlds of butter each per week. With a lack of faith that dlscounts Ingersoll, they claim there is a swindle, and that the ' creamery " men are supplied with oleomargarine oil, which they mix with the cream and thus have so much "creamery" butter for sale. Mo0e than this, they have gone through the stataisics of manufacture, export and creamery pro duct, and are disposed to prove It. Oleo margarine is said to be pure and healthful, and hence the expert cannot tell the differ ence. It does not seem there is much cause for complaint. But by the t;me this "cream ery" butter teaches Mo:! ana and slands a few weeks, it is rancid. Wilen the ve y best of dairy and packed butter can be had from our ranclmen, why should Montana import the manipulated grease from the east ? THE E lRTARt YHtiP. It is about time another Secretary for Mon t1as were being appointed. On Octoberlst, 18I1, a letter was transmitted from which the following is an extract: To the I'reideet.

As the secretary holds until his successor Is appoluted and qualiLes by oath and bond, it is presumed It was con. aidered eut to defer the succession unil the date named, and as the Laws haveslue been priated and the audit by the Treasury Department made, there appears ao reason why the appelateent should be deferred many days Ioer. la this eaa ton we wish to thank *ea oma friends who hav bes ensmueas, hae pabss appseviqgly and sgeOed eatinas nesIstaes.

Straight Mormon Sas expottnded by Joseph Smith has ex isted since Iti0; as expounded by Brigham In i- Y.ug, with the polygamous annex, since 1t+2, although previous to that it was se- of cretly practiced. It Is not creditable that a l from this latter date until now the United in '.

The Latter-Day Mor- t itr mols claim polygamy as a part of their rell w gill and take refuge behind their alleged of ed constitutional rigihts. They, or a iy other of at SIs the hundred sects in existence, might just as o0 ith properly claim anty other crime to be a part el 4J. of their eligion.

Olne element of this proposition is proven by their persistence in polygamous marriages, a esti- custom not only antagonistic to the princi ous ples of all civilized people, but in direct de esti- fiance of the law of the UnitedStates against ex- bi allty.

D)EATH Or JOHN W. FORNEY. John W. Forney, one of the two most plominent Journalists in Penusylvania, is dead. He was born in Lancaster, in 1'17, and took a regular apprenticeship as a printer. In 18.5 he assumed the editoeship of the PecnylJanaa, an influential Demo cstatic paper. Six years later he became Clerk of the House of RepoesentaJves, and in 1Fi was a candidate in Pennsylvania for the Senatorship, and defea.ei by a few votes. He went to 'hiladelphia and started the Press, end was a great power in secutitg the nomiali.on and eleciton of Buchanan. Duriun the Lecompton strife in Coigress he turned ajainst Bcbhanan-;n. dured thereto it has been surmised by Buchanan having failed to give him a Cabi net appolutment-and thetlreforward until 1880 acted with the Bepuhlicans.

Mr. Forney was a tapid and able writer. anI indefatlgable worker, and one of the best informed men In the count ry, doing an im. meniiky of work beside that enumerated.

Colonel Furney died in Phobs delphia December 9th. The other great editor of Pensylarlaia is Colonel A. K. MeClure, of hbe Philadelphia Thees. He is about the usame ae .s Colonel Forney.

PARAMA CANAL. w The questions growing out of the proposed be interoctanec waterway across the Isthmus of }I e Paiarna are of grave national importance. t Thins Government has not been unmindful ti I of the snlemn obligations imposed upon it p it by its compact of 1546 with Colombia, the qi d independent and sovereign mistress of the 1 , territory crossed by the canal, and has sought ti to render them effective by fresh engage- ri s ments with the Colombian Republic, looking qi 7 to their practical execution. The negotla- 0 r- tions to this end, after they reached what ap- r 1-peared to be a mutually satisfactory solution u here, were met in Colombis by a disavowal i n of the power which its envoy had assumed, b af and by a proposal for renewed negotiation ti as on a modried basis. Meanwhile this Gov- n rt e unment learned that Coluuba had proposed Ii to tile European Powers to join In a guaran- p it tee of tile neutrality of the proposed Panama id Cainal, a guarantee which would be iii direct I. contravention of our obligation as the sole id guarantor of the Integrity of Colombian ter ritory, and of the neutrality of the caual it at self. My lamented predecessor felt it his ° duty to lay before the European Powers the t as reasons which make tile prior guarantee of ill the United States indispensable, and for wl iclh the imterjection of any foreign guar to antee might be regarded as asuperfluous and if- unfriendly act. Foleseeing the probable re be liance of the Blritish Government on tlhe pro visions of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850, as aIlirditg room for share in the guarantees which the United States covenanted with ve Colombia four years before, I have not hesi ud tated to supplement the action of my prede es cessor by proposing to Her Majesty's Gov ertnment the modification of that instrument P' and tile abrogation of such clauses thereof a as do not comport with the obligations of the ses United S ates toward Coloumbia or with the on- vital reeds of the two friendly partiesto the compact.

The cost of the star se, vice must Ihec.aore rapidly decrease in the West ern States and the Territories. TaE iNDIAN qCsrTIOIo. 1. I recommend the passage of an act making the laws of the various 8(ates and Tearritories applcauble to he Indian reserva ,sons within their borders, andsirtendingtl e laws of Arkansas to that portion of the In dian Ternitory not occupied by the ive civil Ized tribes. The Indian should receive the protection of the law; he should be allowed to maintalu in court his sighas of person and property. Be has repeatedly begged for this privilege. Its exercse would be ve y valua ble to him In his progress.oward civilliation. 2. Of even greater impoiaance Is the meks nre which has been frequently recommended by my predecessors In oIre, and in furiber ance of which several bills, have been from time to time introduced iu both bouses of Congles. The enactment of a general law per miitlng the allotment Iu severalty, to such Indians at least as desire it, of a reasonable quanitty of land. secured to them by patent and for their own pretec ion made jiadlena ble for twenty or twenty-6ve years, is de manded for their present welfare and iheir permanent advancement. In trls a a for such considerate action on the part o thGovera meat, there is reason to believe that the In dians tio lall neubers would be persuaded to sever their tribal melations and to engage at once in agrleuLural posusts, sad ft is now for their bees iterests to easero theirmus ur of life to the new eder eo thiup.

This suggestion is approved. I rec eommeod aIso the mpassing of an et providing that in the Territories of the United States the fact that a woman has been mnarried to a w person charged with bigamy shall not dis qualify her as a witness upon h.s trial for S that offense.

CIVIL SnRVICE. The question of civil service is considered t at length, and the President inclines toward the adoption of amodificationof the English t system rather than the compeitive examina- I tion system advocated by many. The Message closes with a recommenda tion for speedy legislation concerning the vote of Presidential Electors, and an actde- 1 1 fining the term "inability " as applied to the. President and which was so fully discussed during the recent disability of President Garfield. h THE 

MORMON QUESTION. Governor Neil, of Idaho, Offers His opinions. it NEw Yonct, December 12.-Gov. Nell, of if Idaho, now here, was interviewed yesterday e by a Tribune reporter on the subject of Mor e monism. The Governor said: Mormonism is a serious questionon the Pac;i0c Coast,and Mormons are making special effors to coln 's trol Territories outside of Utah, where they have already complete mastery. If the press o of the country would discuss the question me thoroughly, a sentiment would soon be cre e sted that would compel Con;ress to art mu the mailer. I should also like to say hat the e- division of pailes in U.ah is "In sympathy of with Mormonism" and "Anti-Mormon." y There are no Republicans or Democrats known as such there, and I find among the d stanchest Anti-Mormons such men as Judse e- Roseborough, Judge Sutherland. and Col. e Samuel Menitt. and many other prominent SIDemocrats, all as hostile as any Republicans to to the prevailing system. It is part of the plan of the Mormon Church to populate the surrounding Territories and States with its al adherents, with the view of ultimately gain i- log political eon. rol of them and then bar gaining with ei her of the political partiesto ), have the Territorles admitted as States, thus obtaining the balance of power in Congress. In my opinion the No-mon Chioch is more '- of a political than a religions organization, ae and I am convinced that it is a treasonable t- orgaoizat ion. I believe that all the mem ic bers of it who go through the Endowment in House take an oath of hostility to the Gov ernment, and I have myself heard treason ble doctrines preached in the Salt LakeTab. ed ernacle. In my judgment it will be ulti - imnately necessary to deal with the question ie from this standpoint, unless Cong-ess adopis ,,% immediately very effeciual measures ýo pre an vent the practice and splead of polygamy, On for that ie the couer-stone of the Church. rou Polygamy gives all who join the society a Amt community of interest in crime, and Ihat is 'or why the p,iests insist strenuously on the in practice of polygamy. The- know that fu '' sterest in crime will stienlthen lhe Church mly and make it better able to stccompl;sh its de to signs. Dear Lake county. in Idaho, is popo lated exclusavely by Mormons. The last in census gave it a popuniaion of 3,200. One;da iSty county, bavrng the Iargest representation in S r u.r.o r - V C.nV i, out of a total of 7.500 in the county. In s. Cosseau county they have a number of set ry tlements and are enabled by thlrowlg their i votes for those who are friendly to them to i- decide electlions. The Territory has a popu iation of about 410,00, and time Mormons number nearly 10,000. Mornmoolsm is op. d- posed to all inrmdustries, particularly to mm Iu lg, which is the greatest interest of the Pa cfic slope. If time Mormons haod tie powe e they would not permit an ounce of ore to be he e;oed, nor, indeed, would they allow any persons hostile to their peoenllar institutions to settle in their midst. I am fmnqmently be-asked how,in afree eounty like ihis, the Mormon priesthood exercimes so comnplete ed control over the followers of tlme Churi;h. It leg is easy of te planation. TheMormon lpopl in- laton is largely made up of the lowest and ' most superstiious clases of frme;gners. In . their own truottles they were accustomed to we submit to priestl;y domination or they iLved in underadespotie Government. When ,aou.ht Sto Americae they are put on the cars at New ce York and talken as rapidly as possible to t- Utah, where they mare placed for settlement in exclusively Mormon communities. They have eaet no;thblng and know nodhing of American institutions, and are permitted to learn mohingof them. They ate bited .e eonstotly by Mormon priesl and their con In- det is wamched. oI factthere is ibe moest eemplete system of espolisge that could pc ed sibly he delrvsed. It is not surprising, then, a that they submit willingly to that which i they are saccstomed to In the counotries from Swhich they tame; and agai, before they cam e tes, they bad nothinmgpobably which atheycould eal teirowa. Bere, after do - elarso their mnteuioa to become etizens, they take up a hbome sad goverment land.

Six months ago lie shot a land I's lord in Ireland, and came to this coiut,,y. e In Ireland he was a gentleman, and kept a lie pack of hounds, but he was in full sympa its thy with the poor peasantry.

Ch The T,.ibtme finds the message objections- g,( ble chiefly for its recommendat ions on the silver question and for its unusual length. lie The a1,1'. O'ceoI regards it as a dignified, Lc worthy document, a vigorous and straight- p forward message, one of the best given to mi the country for ffteen years. All the jour- re nals notice its great length. Nzw Yos, December 7.-The Journals it are crowded to-day with the President's mes- t] sage, and the documents incident to the opmning of the new Congress. The message m it -ilf is universally well spoken of, patticu lat y by Republican and independent sheets. The World says: The message in a word i is full of views, and the views are not pie tended to be the views of the counltry or ra even of the party, but only t hepersonal opin- et ions of the author of the message, which are ei to be taken as going for what they are worth. P' No carerul reader of the message can faIl to at note this peculiarlty, and few reflective read- a es will be ata loss to assign it to its I,ue 01 ca tee. Isis the same cause wlhich made the letter of acceptance of the Republican cart- I didate for Vice-President last year so mtlh d more outspoken and positive than the letter a of the Republican candidate for President. S The World concludes: In legard to the e finances and io our forel.n iela;tons, il b I Pesident sneaks with a force and .ilea. llts which will cotmmand the trespect of patliotic iI men of all parties.
