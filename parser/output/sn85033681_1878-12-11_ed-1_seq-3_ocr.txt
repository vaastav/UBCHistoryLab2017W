The greenback candidate for Gov er sucn a taw would re?ult in any good even if it was constitutional. When men want liquor they will have it, law or no law, and the at tempt to enforce a local act would create strne ana. nara-jeeimg in neighborhoods, thus resulting per haps in more harm than is wrought by, the sale of liquor. We have a law on the statute book of Tennessee now which if properly enforced will meet the object of the temperance people without any elec tion. , That is the act forbidding the Bale of intoxicating liquors within four miles of a chartered institution of learning.

He graduated at Princeton College in 18C8, with.the first honors of his class. After leaving college he be gan the study of law and wa soon admitted to practice. In 1870, he was elected clerk of the Circuit court oF U5arpson county, for the ensu ing period of four years. At the expiration of his term he declined to run again, and resumed the practice of law, which he has since prosecu tedwiih,, success in.

And if East TeDBessee members have no special choice of their own froji this end of the State, and will take for it the word of one, 'win? knows whereof he writes, they can make no better selection of a presiding officer west of the mountains, than the subject of this npice. II. G. Iv. RoG'rcivrxLE, TejsN.,No:v. 29, '78 The above letter was written and handedjtqTus by a gentleman who is well acquainted with Mr. Fowlkes, and to please our friend, if for no oer, reason, we would be gratified to hear that the talented young gen tlemari .froia Williamson had been selected to preside over the next House. The young Democracy of the State should be encouraged in i - - eTOr-'way possible, because upon them must soon devolve the welfare of the country. We are for putting our young-men forward as fast as possible. - ; : - "Local optictm'' is beginning to excite a good deal of interest In the State of Tennessee just now. The ujeaningof the term "local option" is that the Legislature shall pass an act permitting the qualified voters of a civil district to say at the ballot box whether intoxicating liquors shall be sold within the district or not. Such an act was passed in this State- while Hon. John C. Brown was Governor, and he vetoed it on the ground of its unconstitutionality. If another law similar to that one skouid be enacted by the incoming General Assembly it will be apt to ireet the same fate at the hands of Governor Marks, We doubt wheth- the thirteenth, fourteenth and fif teenth amendments, and law passed in pursuance thereof!, should,! in good faith, be enforced rigidly and impar tailly, in letter and spirit, to the end, that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color, should, under them,
