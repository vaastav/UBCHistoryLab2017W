It is not only in the conceiving and suggesting of legislative reforms that the president is setting the wise men of the country gathered in Washington an excellent example, but he is showing them also how to go about getting themselves into the best possible condi tion physically for attaining the best results mentally. In fine, the president has become a preacher, by example, of the gospel of exercise. He has taken to horseback riding, and in consequence that form of outdoor exercise has be come immensely popular at the national capital. The great bane of American public life is the tremendous exaction it makes upon the time and energy of those who occupy official position. The pressure of severe mental labor, united with a disinclination toward recuperative ex ercise or ignorance of the proper way of procuring that exercise, has been the cause of the breaking down of many American public men who were yet in their prime. We live at too high pres sure in this country. The human machine is continually hammering away without a single stop page for repairs until it finally collapses, ntterly worn out. They do these th ings differently across the water, and ready as we sometimes are to adopt sugges tions from our English cousins, it is curi ous that we have not learned from them something about the way to pre serve vitality and to maintain rugged health. It must be an urgent reason Indeed i that will prevent the English •public man from enjoying his frequent holidays— breathing times that we prac tically know nothing of— and his daily exercise. . What man in public life on this side 'of the water retains, like Gladstone. jj'n vigorous old age his youthful vigor? The only name that occurs is that of Bancroft, the historian, who has all his life been a conscientious believer in the efficacy of systematic exercise as a means of prolonging mental and bodily health. There can be no manner of doubt that, if the statesmen in Washing ton would refresh mind and body by periodical devotion to forms of out-door life, the standard of legislative achieve ments would be raised materially. The president, wisely recognizing the necessity in his own case, has done well in setting the example. It would be well if it were followed without excep tion. There are enough forms of exer cise to please every taste. 

EUROPE'S STORM. Our foreign news this morning has a decidedly warlike aspect. The cloud which hung on the European horizon a little while ago no larger than a man's hand is now looming up in massive pro portions. Russia evidently realizes the menacing conditions, and is rapidly hurrying forward the work of protect ing her frontiers. The aggressive tone of the German reichstag is evidence that Russia's fears are well grounded. The temper of the public mind at Berlin leaves no room to doubt that war is imminent. England, too, has caught the infection , and places her navy at the ', disposal of the powers to aid in enforcing the tripartite agreement. France, poor France, has too many domestic troubles and internal dissensions just now to as sume an aggressively belligerent atti tude, but by the time the other powers are fairly into it France will have healed her local quarrels sufficiently to become an active factor in the great contest which will probably result in re-map ping Europe, It now looks as though the beginning of the end were at hand, and another month will in all probabil ity reveal the fiercest and most destruct ive war that ever swept the continent. EXPELLING THE ANARCHISTS. Among the many important bills that will be before congress this winter, the one introduced by Mr. Adams to expel anarchists from this com 4 y mer its as serious consideration as any of them. its importance lies not only in the apparent necessity for such legisla tion, but also in the novelty of such a measure in a republican government. It is admitted that 'there appears to be a necessity for legislation of this charac ter, and yet the enactment of a law of the kind indicated would be the longest | stride toward monarchical government that the republic has ever made. The anarchists are an undesirable class in ♦any country. It would be a bless ing if they could be kept away from United Slates territory. We have no need for the seditious citi zens or subjects of other governments. But how to ke;;> litem away or to get rid of them after they are once here is the question. While we acknowledge that the Adams bill would accomplish the desired end, we also feel that such a law would be a dangerous precedent. If %c commence once to abridge the free dom of political opinion or to restrict the freedom of speech, where and when will it end? As long as a law for the expulsion of anarchists is confined in operation to aliens there would be no substantial ground for complaint. Un fortunately anarchism has taken root in American soil, and there are "American citizens who are just as fanatical as the Spieses and the Herr Mosts. Little would be gained by expelling the alien anarchists and leaving the home-made article to flourish. If neces sity requires the expulsion of one it will require the expulsion of all. And just here is the trouble in adopting laws of the character of the Adams bill. If the government has the power to ex patriate its citizens because of their po itical opinions, what is to prevent a dominant political party from declaring the doctrines of the opposition to be po litical crimes and to make itself secure in power by expatriating all the mem bers of the minority? Of course, this, on the face of it.may seem a far-fetched illustration, but greater results have often come from smaller beginnings. At all events, it would be well for con gress to consider the Adams bill in all its phases and its possible consequences before enacting it into a law. The ex pulsion of the anarchists would he grat ifying to all good citizens, provided it can be done without a strain upon our much cherished republican institutions. ■ — ■-•»■ CHRISTMAS CLUBS. Occasionally a good thing may come out of that Nazareth which we call the metropolis of America. A number of charitably disposed young people of so ciety have formed Christmas clubs, the object of which can not be too highly commended. The idea is for each mem ber of the club to secure from her or his personal acquaintance contributions of any kind coming under the general head of necessaries of life. A common fund is made of these con tributions; and then, dividing into com mittees, the club makes it its business to discover what poor families or home less children aie likely to be left with out a substantial remembrance of Christ mas day. Then from the store of the club judicious selections are made and hundreds of deserving people made happy by the receipt of gifts much needed, and all the more grateful be cause unexpected. It is not often that in the frivolity of society an idea is conceived worthy of general adoption, but in this case the ingenuity and energy of the young peo ple well deserves every praise and wide spread imitation. As the season of --peace on earth and . good will toward men" approaches, the heart naturally softens, and the disposition to give ex pression to something of its feeling in forms of charity could not take a better direction than that indicated in the formation of Christmas clubs. There is a field here in St. Paul for just such work, and those who may en gage in it will find themselves the richer on Christmas morning for the fervent blessings which their good deeds will call down upon them. >«•»■ Tite ladies ot the Flower mission are mak ing an appeal to the charitably disposed peo ple of St. Paul that should meet with a gen erous and ready response. They ask for do nations of fruit, jellies, delicacies or money to aid them in making the coming Christmas as pleasant as possible for the sick in the various hospitals and charitable institutions. Nearly every one can give a little.and the ag gregate will be sufficient to make many a poor unfortunate, if not happy, for a day at least comparatively comfortable. Mrs. T. C. Field and Mrs. Thad Jones will receive con tributions after 10 a. m., Saturday. Dee. 24, at Unity church. In the afternoon of that day they will distribute the contributions re ceived. m — The president has recommended to con gress that the government pay to depositors the sums lost by them in the Freedmen's bank. Let's see, bow long has it been - since our Republican friends were telling the ne groes that they would all be made slaves again in the event of Cleveland's election? W. D. Washburn, whose name is familiar in other places beside Minneapolis, has been telling the Eastern papers that he cordially approves of the president's message. Mr. Washburn might also have added that he voiced the sentiment of the entire Northwest. ■-■■ The only reliable European war cloud is the one that hovers like a halo around the classic head of J. Lawrence Sullivan, of Boston, now abroad for his health and the money there is in it. -•»- Mr. Wisdom was present at the convention of the Republican clubs. It may interest Minnesotians to know that Mr. v» indom, of whom they may have heard, claimed to rep resent Minnesota. ♦ Next Sunday will be Christmas day. As you listen to your church service to-day, re solve to make next Sunday a happy day for some poor family and you will be happier yourself. -a* A city official of London has been asked to resign because he asked for free theater tick ets. Just fancy for an instant if this prece dent should be followed on this side of the water: You will buy most of your Christmas gifts during the coming week, of course, and a careful reading of the Globe's advertising columns will tell you just where to buy them. The Nun of Kenmare will publish a book assailing Dr. McGlyxn. And yet it had been hoped that the doctor was at the end ot his advertising rope. I— — W_U _ Sis Rome has decided to espouse the cause of Ireland, will the Tory government countermand the order for the pope's jubi lee present! — ' Onto Shermanites are talking about swing ing over to Chauncey Detew.

New York, Dec. 17.— The steamer Etruria, which reached Queenstown to day, made the fastest east-bound trip on record, her time from New York to Fastnet being six days and two hours.

THE SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: STTNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 18, 1887.— TWENTY PAGES. A FOOL'S WISDOM. There is a feminine character in Pell can Rapids, whose nickname for a num ber of years has been "Minnesota Bliz zard." The title deserves to pass into history arm and arm with that of "Bung Baasen." She went to Washing ton during Billy Wisdom's palmiest days to obtain a pension for her hus band. This was a difficult matter; but she began to talk to the Republican members ot this state. She talked early and late, before breakfast and after supper, rain or shine. Wisdom, if I am not mistaken, after weeks of her talking, named her the "Minnesota Blizzard" and told the commissioner of pensions that either the pension must be granted or the Minnesota delegation be killed by talking. The "Blizzard" got her pension. « * * Fergus Falls is agitated over the ques tion as to whether the governor ought to commute the sentence of Oolong. the murderer of the Fields girl, and who is now under sentence of death. The murder, readers of the Globe will remember, was peculiarly atrocious, the victim being only sixteen years old.and, as near as ever can be ascertained, de fending her honor when slain. The plea for commutation is made on the ground that Oolong is insane. His in sanity is just as strenuously denied by those who know the prisoner and under stand that the crime was in part pre meditated. There is some indication of the issue being made a political one by those who are opposed to capital pun ishment. In that case, the governor's well known leaning toward the Fifth district will not only save Oolong's neck, but also restore the life of his in nocent victim. By so doing he will un doubtedly satisfy both sides and mate rially benefit himself. * * In the way most women manage horses there is something that causes the average man to believe that Provi dence does protect us. A lady stepped into tier sleigh on Wabasha street tiie other day, and taking up the reins talked to her horse like this: "Get up!" "Coon. Billy." "Get up! Get up!" "Billy, why don't you go?" "You horrid brute!" "What a stupid!" The horse, despite all this, stood stock still. Then his mistress spoke to a gen tleman who had been watching her: "Can you make this animal start, sir?" . He politely bowed, came forward, unhitched the horse and patted him on the neck. Then the "horrid brute" and "stupid animal" started. IT * I understand that the common coun cil intend to take charge of the high license matter in St. Paul. lam told that at their next meeting they will pass a resolution forbidding the city clerk from issuing any licenses on Jan. 1. The knotty point raised is whether or not under the new law, twenty days after the election in May will the sa loonkeepers in St. Paul have to take out new licenses— that is, pay $1,000 Jan. 1 and then again in May? This, the high license people (some of them) explain will not be the case, the broad intent of the law being that licenses shall, when paid in January and the election comes in May, amount in value to that per cent of $1,000 or $500 that one-third of a year may come to. The purpose of this pro- - vision is that if at an election a city or town decides to raise licenses or ab olish them the decision may take effect within twenty days thereafter. Of course, the saloons don't intend to close Jan. 1, but it is very doubtful if any licenses .will be issued then, and per haps for some time afterwards. * » The Columbia association has been considering this point in the license law, and has come to the conclusion that the courts should pass upon it before any licenses are paid in St. Paul. There is as well the unsettled point raised in Minneapolis, as to whether the brewers and wholesale liquor dealers are sub ject to this $1,000 tax. The Minneapolis courts hold that they are. I have heard wholesale dealers say themselves that they thought they were, but the su preme court has yet to pass upon it. These two questions will delay the en forcement of the license law in St. Paul, but what complications it will lead to can lutrdly be foreseen. The irrational ones of the temperance clement are in clined to make a fuss, and talk loudly about what ought to be done with the city council, William Pitt Murray and the saloonkeepers. That's arrant non sense. It is only fair now to presume that when it is decided what the law is it will lie obeyed. It has been a serious question for ten months past whether the high license bill was a law or a com-, pound of tom-fool lawyerisms. Marcus Johnson and other Repub licans residing at Atwater or there abouts are said to be quietly booming Donnelly for the Republican candi date for congress from the Third dis trict next year. Should this be true, Mai. Strait might fall upon his mar row bones and thank the Lord he was out of politics. It is only four years ago that one afternoon at Glencoe a Democratic convention nominated Mr. Donnelly for congress. He stumped the district on what is in truth a free trade platform. By all . means bring him out next year for Republican ism and protection. He would accept just as readily and fight just as hard as he did in 1888. Little cares Ignatius whether his breeches are blue or black, Give him an audience, a campaign fund and a butt for his jokes, and he'll be what you ask, without question. * * Mr. Donnelly's chameleon charac teristics remind me of the story told of him years ago by one of his political op- j ponents. He said: "I dreamed last night that Donnelly j had died and was standing at the gates of heaven knocking for adm ission. St. Peter asked him who he was. This hurt Donnelly's vanity, that he should not be known of in heaven, so lie kept silent but rapped on, when St. Peter asked: _ 'Are you a Republican?' " 'Yes.' " 'Ever been a Democrat?' " 'Am now.' " 'And an anti-monopolist?' " 'Yes.' " -Friendly to railroads?' " 'Yes.' " 'Son of toil? 1 " 'Yes.' "'Author?' "'Yes.* " 'Free-trader?' • " -Yes.'j " 'Protectionist?' " 'Yes.' " 'Ah,' said St. Peter, as he drew another bar across the door, 'only the devil could he all that. I know you.'" * * * During the campaign last year Charley Oilman took a severe cold, hut as he was still in the field for a nomination, he would not go home. In consequence Major Wilson put him to bed in his own room at the Merchants. He kept getting worse, and angered the major by refusing to have a doctor. Finally Wilson came to him one night and said : "1 tell you. Charley, there's just one thing that will cure you." "What's that?" groaned the states man?" "Why, you want to have Eli Warner come in Here and tell you how pretty McGill is. while G-888 swaps lies with yon about delegates. That'll sweat you out of bed." » • m Here is a Republican congressional slate for next year that is receiv ing some attention: First District— White. Second District— John* Lind. Third Ignatius Donnelly. Fourth District— Lores Fletcher. Fifth District— Steams. Against these five I hear mentioned as possible Democratic candidates, Henry R. AVeli.es, Judge Wilson, Tom Bowen, E. C. Steinger, * Judge Mac Donald, Edmund Rice and A. R. Whitemax. Judge Start is talked of in the First district, but he would never accept a qualified nomination,and"| that practically puts him out of the race. B. B. Heruert is not dead yet, but the convention will probably stiffen his hones. Judge Si earns will have to 1 confront at least a half dozen Repub lican opponents. • * • -How will John Lind vote on the tariff question in congress this winter? He is elected from a free trade district, and has high protection views. Will the young and budding statesman dodge or stick to his constituents?. The situ ation is interesting. If there is one thing that could defeat Mr. Lind in his own district it would be a free trade campaign. Perhaps he knows this. By a Fool. DRAMATIC DRIFT. By far the best dramatic performance of the season has been Miss Olcott's production of "Theodora" at the Grand the past week. It was the best both as respects the dramatic ability of the star and the gorgeousness of the stage set ting and costuming. Miss Olcott played to large houses the first part of the week, but owing to the excitement over the National opera engagement her business suffered somewhat during the latter part of the week. * * The National Opera company will open its season in St. Paul to-morrow night in a grand spectacular production of Rubinstein's great opera "Nero," in which will be presented the famous scene "The Burning of Rome," which is described as being the most effective scene ever depicted on an American stage. For Tuesday night the previously announced bill of Verdi's "Aida" has been changed to the "Flying Dutch man," in order to gratify a popular de sire to hear one of Wagner's composi tions during the engagement. "Queen of Sheba" will be given at the Wednes day matinee, and "Faust" Wednesday evening, as previously announced. * * A telegram last night from Charles E. Locke, proprietor of the National Opera company, announced that his company would leave Omaha this morn ing at 4 o'clock, traveling in two special trains of twenty-two cars. The com pany will arrive at the union depot in this city this evening about 9 o'clock. Mr. Jones, the advance agent, has en gaged eighteen carriages and twenty omnibuses to convey the members of the company to the various hotels where they will stay during their sojourn in the city. * * Following on the heels of the National opera engagement comes New Beers' lyric spectacular play, "Lost in London," which will occupy the Grand the last half of the week. It is a poor spectacular show nowadays that doesn't have a ballet and a Bible story. Mr. Beers' is provided with both. He advertises two fascinating fairy ballets giving three pleasurable hours and six impressive stage pictures, and In addi tion there is "Job's Vision," giving a veritable glimpse of ('lory Land. The glimpse of ('lory Land from the stage of a St. Paul theater is a fairy tale sure enough. An opera cyclone has struck the Northwest. Next week, Christmas week, we are to have "The Gypsy Baron," which was so popular here last season, and the following week Ed Johnstone's "Bostoiiian" wins of the old Ideals will take the town. The"Bos tonians" have had a streak of luck this season. Notwithstanding Col. Fos ter's oft-repeated assertion that they are bric-a-brac from Noah's ark, they seem to have caught the drift of the popular tide better than the colonel himself did. The Bible has furnished a wealth of material for the poet and the artist. It is not singular then that the world's great musical composers should have drawn on the sacred book for themes. The story of Queen Balki's visit to Solomon furnished Karl Goldmark with a subject worthy of his genius, and his treatment of it as given in his en chanting opera is a lasting monument to his fame. * * The Grand opera houses in Paris and La Scalar, Milan, must turn out a great many premiere ballet dancers. There isn't a traveling show with a ballet at tachment but announces that its stage nymphs are led by some lady with an unnrouounceable name, from one of these opera houses. It has got to be as common as lor an actress to advertise that her dresses were made by Worth. Why theatrical managers, catering to American audiences, should want to give a foreign flavor to their perform ances is past finding out. The fact is that most of the ballet premieres.as well as the stage costumes, come from New York; and as New York can turn out as good a grade of each as either Paris or Milan, the wonder is that our American managers are not willing to give our American folks the credit they are en titled to. * * There are a great "many young people who are stage-struck, who, it they only knew the truth that one year in the pro fession would teach them, would be sat isfied to seek some other field for wealth and fame. Stage success de pends more upon luck than merit. There are some actors of pre-eminent ability, like Booth, Salvini and Bern hardt, who rise in spite of circum stances. But in nine cases out of ten those who have been most successful have been the creatures of fortunate circumstances. Acting has reached that place which makes the stage man ager the autocrat of the theater. The man who knows how to mount a play is a more successful artist these days than the one who plays the dramatic role. * » The ballet has lost caste with Ameri can audiences. A nice clog dancer or a fancy jig beats a ballet all hollow. There is a grace and melody of move ment in a jig or a clog that is sadly lacking in the ballet, and then there is no suggestiveness of the vulgar. *. * * Rose Cogiilan has taken up Gene vieve Ward's old play *'Forget-Me- Not." Miss Cogiilan must have im proved her stage methods since she was in St. Paul by adding finesse and elab oration of detail if she can give as artis tic impersonation of Stephanie as Miss Ward did. » * * Lotta's kindheartedness got her into trouble the other day. She was taking a walk along a street in Boston the other afternoon, when she saw a lame horse attached to a herdic and be ing whipped by the driver. She re monstrated with the driver, and when he refused to stop at her command, she caught hold of the bridle and delayed the conveyance until a policeman came up and made the driver take the horse to its stable. The cab bad for its pas senger a commercial traveler named Abraham Samuels, who got mad at Lotta and nows sues her for $50,00*, because he failed to catch his train. • • * Teresina Tua, the young It/lan violinist who has had a remarkabl ca reer in Europe, made friends of royalty on her recent tour of the continent. The queen of Spain made her court violin ist, and the queen of Italy decorated her with the order of "Stella d' Italia." The queen mother of Spain gave her a genuine Amati violin, on which she plays in concerts. The Prince of Wales sent her a gold violin studded with dia monds, and the emperor of Russia made her a present of a valuable diamond brooch. * * * Lawrence Barrett comes to Shakespeare's defense in the Decem ber number of the North American Re view. He says: "His creations stand breast high with those of the Old and New Testaments, and when we have torn from the writers of the Bible their Moses, Isaiah, Ecclesiastes, their evangelists and teachings of the sacred text, we may then, and then only, be ready to deny his Hamlet and his Lear, his tender lmogene and his moralizing Jaques, his gallery of Romans, and the star-eyed Egyptian, to the 'poor player' who lived and died, aud was buried, and has come down to us »+ William SnAKEsrEApo^* AGoi#'t_iMfe Paris.

WHISPERS. The daring robbery of a St. Paul jew elry store reminds me of what a local jeweler was saying the other day about diamond drummers. A diamond drum mer is a man who travels all over the country with a collection of choice stones, sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, which he sells to the jewelers In different cities. The gems are not carried in a hand satchel in the way the ordinary drummer carries his samples, but are kept in a capacious pocketbook or in a belt carried .next the body. The drummer uses every precaution to prevent his occupa tion from being known to any one but the teweler. with whom he deals, as, onccKnown, he is sure to be followed and attacked by thieves. It was only the other day that a diamond drummer was sandbagged in Kansas City and al most killed. So great is the peril that only "salesmen of proven courage and great physical strength are selected to .go oat the road, and they are always * I heavily armed. There have been sev eral of these drummers in the city lately, and each one of them had the uncom " ** ortanle feeling that he was being fol lowed, j Not a very good occupation for a I timid! is it? * - ■ -i For a man who claims not to care whether he receives the Republican nomination or not, Mr. Blame evinces a wonderful deal of anxiety as to the state of feeling in this country. Accom panying Lilian Olcott to St. Paul was a Mr. Cunningham, who was os tensibly a sort of agent of the young act ress. It appears, however, that he has other duties. Mr. Cunningham, who isa personal friend of Blame's manager, "Steve" Elkins, makes it his business to converse. with as many representa tive people as possible regarding the candidacy of the man from Maine, and makes daily reports to Mr. Elkins, who probably studies them with a great deal of interest, particularly those coming from the anti-tariff Northwest since Mr. Blame's denunciation- of the presi dent's message appeared. But Mr. Blame will find out what the people think very effectually a year hence. The Whisperer. MEN WHO TALK. Channino Searury, of Maxfield &Seabury— of the best indica tions of the stability of the market is shown by the determination of the to bacco manufacturers to increase . the prices of this article 2 cents a pound. This, too, despite the fact that congress is considering the advisability of reduc ing the tax of 8 cents per pound now levied on tobacco. Ordinarily agitation of this sort would c*iuse a decline in prices, but tobacco men evidently do not fear such a movement, or they would not be so unanimous for an in crease. I think, after considering the mat ter pretty thoroughly, that Mr. Blame is right in his assertion that tobacco is not a luxury but a necessity and hence should be relieved from the inter nal revenue assessment, while whisky is abundantly able to carry any load that may be imposed. Laboring men have come to regard a supply of tobacco to be almost as indispensable as bread for their comfort, and the supply of the farmer is not equal to the demand by any means. Take l a .itn's manu factures, for instance, for we have none in stock nor can we procure any at this time; and what is worse than that, there is no telling when we can obtain it. P. T. Kavanagh. P. T. Kavaxaoii. of Kavanagh & Dawson— men have recently become our best customers in the real es tate^ line, and while no large deals have been consummated, the market has a healthy and vigorous prospect. Num jbers of mechanics and laborers have made' purchases of midway property, •especially in Stinson's addition and at Gladstone, where the Duluth road's -shops, will be transferred the .Ist of January. 1888. Thus far I have not been able to learn that any of the em ployes of the road in question have be come owners of land in the vicinity of the • shops, but for the most part 1 the g purchases, have been made**; by laborers Who \ work in St.- Paul. One , block of eleven . lots was sold to-day at an' average price of $•500 each, and they will all be improved with substantial and comfortable dwell ngs by their new owners. ..;, Alfred Dufresne. Alfred Dufresne, of the P.H.Kelly Mercantile Company — Business up to date makes a better showing than for a corresponding period last year, and sales have been larger and profits bet ter than for any previous season that I can recall. Collections have been right up to the mark, and losses few and com paratively slight in proportion to the volume of transactions. It was ex pected that the holiday trade would be good up to within a few days before Christmas and that we might then ex pect a lull, say until about the 15th of January. But we have experienced no falling off that is perceptible, and the indications are that business will keep on unchecked through the entire win ter. I find the same to be true of the otlier trades besides the grocer's, and money seems to be easy and plenty. 1 do not remember a better winter season than the present. F. E. Wheeler. F. E. Wheeler, St. Paul White Lead and Oil Works— Lake Minnetonka is at present a most attractive spot for those who admire aquatic sports, and a proj ect is on foot looking to the inaugura . tion of an ice boat regatta there . Re cently one of the ice boats, owned by a gentleman at Wayzata, accomplished the distance between that place and Excelsior, about seven miles, in less than five minutes. There is no reason why the Twin Cities should not enjoy this exhilarating sport, and a series of matches ought to be arranged for the winter. Many of those who spent the summer on the banks of 'Minnetonka have retained their cottages, and make frequent trips to them during the win ter, and in some instances they have purchased ice boats for their amuse ment. Owing to the sweep that the wind has in the vicinity of Excelsior and Wayzata, one of the ice boats can go at the rate of ninety miles an hour, and carry ten passengers at that. John Phillips. John Phillips, the artist— On the eve of my departure from St. Paul for the warmer climate of the Pacific slope, 1 cannot refrain from saying a word or two as to the possibilities in the future if the city in which I have spent so many pleasant days and formed life ' long friendships. Walking the streets of St. Paul 1 see on every hand evi dences of substantial prosperity, and especially is this true of the class of buildings that are going up in the ! business portion. Take for instance the new structuaes on Jackson street adjoining the Bank of Minnesota and the annex, to the Ryan hotel, which takes in the block on Seventh street, between Jack son and Robert. These two edifices are Sot surpassed by any buildings of their lass that I have ever seen in my wan derings, which have embraced the globe you might say. and principally for the reason that they contain all the modern improvements from the ground up. They will stimulate others to build the same style of business blocks, and it is almost impossible to tell where such a generous spirit of rivalry will land the Saintly City ten years hence. *'. ■■> l\ ■ • Don't Care Who Kicks. Osakis Observer. President Cleveland ought to be ashamed of himself. Thousands of politi cal editors had reviewed his expected message to congress and had long editor ials already prepared, in their minds at leasts criticising his .views on a hundred different points, and some had already been roasting him on its length, when lo! it was not what was expected at all. Brief, and on only one subject— the tariff. They can not even charge him with straddling of the question, for he got right over the fence and announced himself in favor of reduction, bordering on free trade. It is characteristic of tiie man, however. When he takes a stand he don't care who kicks. . i 

HONORS TOTHE .DEAD Lawyers of the State Do Honor to the Late Judge Berry, They Turn Out in Large Num bers to Attend Memo rial Services. Appropriate Resolutions Read and Ordered Placed on the Court Record. Prominent Members of the Bar Speak Fittingly on the Occasion. The supreme court chamber was filled with the most distinguished and able representatives of the law of the Twin cities, and even of the entire state, yesterday morning, assembled to pay a last tribute, as a body, to the memory of the late Judge Berry. The resolutions adopted by bar associations of the two cities were read and unanimously adopted, after which came a number of eloquent and interesting speeches by the leading attorneys of the state, re citing the talents and many noble quali ties of the deceased member of the su preme bench of the state. It was a sol emn and affecting occasion, and the speeches and resolutions show in what high esteem Judge Berry was held by the lawyers of the state. FROM RAMSEY COUNTY. Ex-Senator MacMillan presented the memorial adopted by the Bar associa tion of Ramsey county. It read thus: '•Since the opening of the present term of the supreme court the earthly career of lion. John M. Berry, the senior asso ciate justice of this* court, has termi nated. As members of the Bar of Min nesota, we desire to express our deep sorrow on account of his death and testify our respect and veneration for his memory. In the „ early part of his professional career lie was called to the bench and for nearly twenty-three years he held the high and responsible position which was made vacant by his death. By his natural endowments and intellectual discipline and attainments he was peculiarly fitted for a judicial life. His learning and ability were quickened in the exercise by a strong sense of justice and an ar dent love for the equity of the law. Free from prejudice and undue intel | lectual bias, he sought out only the j truth in his conscientious discharge of his official duties. In his long judicial career he has indelibly impressed upon the jurisprudence of the state his own wisdom and ability and the purity and uprightness of his character. Honora ble, generous and kind, he was loved and rdspected by all who knew him. In his death our state has lost one of its ablest judges, our profession one of its brightest ornaments, the community a useful and up right citizen, and his family a devoted husband and father. Removed from earth in the midst of his labors and use fulness, we mourn his loss and extend our sincere sympathy to his family in the sad bereavement. *We respectfully request the court to direct that this ex pression of our respect for our departed friend be entered upon its record with such other proceedings as may be had in connection therewith.and that a copy be transmitted to his family." Judge Atwater, of Minneapolis, then presented the touching memorial adopt ed by the Bar association of Hennepin county, with a short and appropriate tribute, as an individual member, to THE 

STERLING QUALITIES of the late judge. -'This is the third time in thirty years," said Judge At water, "that the supreme court of Min nesota has been called upon to pay the last sad tributes to a member of its body. No man who ever practiced at the bench where Judge Berry sat ever had aught to say against him. The tender memo ries of those who knew trim best could never be voiced in language. Though highly loved and honored as a judge, he was even more highly honored as a man. His life was his greatest eulogy. It was fortunate for the state of Minnesota that political preferment had no charms for Judge Berry. When he reached the su preme bench he found the place for which he,- was best fitted. He was a born judge. He has been taken from his high and exalted position, and has been welcomed to the high court." D Judge Flandrau, of St. Paul, and Hon. Gordon E. Cole, of Faribault, then spoke briefly of the life of the deceased judge, and. its effect and part in mould ing the history of the state. Chief Jus tice Gilh'llan was the last speaker, and he spoke in the highest terms of the career and character of Judge Berry. "On behalf of the bar I thank you," he said. "Mr. Justice Berry is the sec ond of this bench to die in the midst of duties. He has been on the bench more than twice as long as any judge but one. Twenty-six volumes of reported decisions testify to the labor of this judge. His decisions concern men in all paths of life. It was fortunate for the people of the state that Judge Berry came on the bench when he did and stayed as long as he did. He was la borious, patient, conscientious, But what need that 1 speak of these things to you who know them all so well? He had other qualities fully known to those only who knew him best. He always shunned anything like notoriety—al most dreaded it. He avoided prefer ment. He had a nobler ambition to fulfill and that was his whole duty. He was a diligent and faithful student. He was an original thinker, and no author could bias his reason or judgment. He was uniform in his kindness and good temper. During twelve years of my as sociation with him nothing ever oc curred to ruffle his good temper." After paying a warm personal tribute to the memory of the late judge, Judge Gilfillan anounced that the proceedings would be placed upon the records of the court and the meeting was at an end. CHICAGO MARKET GOSSIP. Regarding Fluctuations, Schemes and Armour's Actions. Special to the Globe.' Chicago, Dec. 17.— The markets opened higher on sentiment and coun try buying orders, with May wheat quoted at S4c, May corn at 54% c and May pork at $15.95. Offerings of every thing on the list were unlimited. There was a world of wheat for sale at 84c, and of corn at 54%@54%c. Wheat declined to 83% c and corn to 54% c during the first hour. For the first half hour there was a rattling trade in pro visions. The floor traders made a determined and concerted drive at the market, and carried pork for May down to $15.82}^, May lard to $$.22}4, and March ribs to $7.97)£. From this range there was a slight Improve ment, and the market acted strong. Only 900 hogs were received at the yards to-day, and 116,000 for the week against 182,575 for the corresponding week last year. The top prices of the day were obtained early in the morning. Wheat sold down to 832gc. Corn to 54ii'c, and pork to 115.75— a1l for May. The average of prices was considerably above the range, and the markets were firm at a slight decline from outside quotation, and lowest prices .were above yesterday's closing. Wheat cables were rather steadier than they have been of late, but the feeling abroad does not seem to be especially firm as yet; holders are still rewresent ed to be offering grain freely at "current rates. Possibly the war news, which carries with it a reminder of the possibility of the shutting off of Russian supplies, may have something to do with the im proved feeling abroad, but the news did not produce the slightest effect here to • day, for a wonder, though it influenced stock speculation more than a little. .. Hutchinson was the mainstay of the wheat market to-day, his purchases be-, ing on a large scale. The market was narrower to-day and outside business slack, not only in wheat, but ; iii all the pits. In : provisions a strong effort was made early to bull the market to sell on. Bloom bid \}{c above the mar ket for pork, and he bought some at $16. As indicative of Armour's attitude on provisions it is stated by commission merchants that he is buying January and selling May, whereas last year he took their January contracts off their hands and ; sold May sparingly. Last year he wanted the stuff; this year he seems to be quite willing that the other fellows should have the deal and the profits to be made out of it, at least that is the way it seems to the commission merchants and to the trade in general. Provisions to-day are at a small advance over yesterday. FEDERATION OF LABOR. Doings of the Convention in Ses sion at Baltimore. Baltimore, Dec. 17.— The conven tion of the American Federation of La bor this morning took up its considera tion of the report of the committee on resolutions. Many unimportant mat ters were acted upon and business was disposed of as rapidly as possible. The resolution introduced by Mr. Block, del egate from the Bakers' union, denounc ing the actions of the police in various cities interfering with meetings and the tendency of the authorities in some sec tions to curtail the constitutional rights of the people, and insisting that the spirit of anarchy as displayed by the authorities should be condemned by the working people, was the subject of pro longed debate. It was vigorously op- Eosed by a few conservative delegates, ut was finally passed after the words "unlawful oppression" had been substi tuted for anarchy. A resolution was adopted advising workingmen to guard more carefully their constitutional rights and to foster a spirit of inde pendent political action. Another urged the extension of the educational system and the necessity of having the science of government added to the list of sub jects taught in the public schools. The Blair educational bill was endorsed. The protest against a reduction of the internal revenue tax on tobacco was approved, as was also the protest against the proposed extradition treaty with Russia. The efforts being made to establish an international ' system of arbitration as a substitute for war was approved in a resolution. The coercion policy of England towards Ireland was condemned and sympathy expressed with Ireland in her struggles for emancipation. The thanks of the con vention were extended to members of the press, the mayor of Baltimore and the local reception committee. An effort was made to have the convention pass a resolution against any reduction in the tariff on raw materials, but it was not successful. The Chicago printers' difficulty with their employers was de plored, and a resolution was passed sus taining them in the stand they have taken. The eight-hour bill under con sideration by congress was warmly en dorsed, and after the adoption of a few minor measures the convention ad journed sine die. -»— MAKING BAD WORSE, The Anarchist Funeral Commit tees Kicking for Precedence. Chicago, Dec. 17.— Conflict of author ity between the anarchist relief com mittee, sometimes known as the defense committee, and a commilttee appointed by the Central Labor union, has led to a complication that furnishes a comical element in the otherwise solemn affair of the burial of the anarchists that is an nounced to take place to-morrow. The n torment lot at Waldneim cemetery was bought by the defense committee, the members of which do not feel called upon to give up the property to the Central Labor union, professing to be lieve that such action was not intended by the request of the dead men that the union take charge of the burial. It ap pears, however, that Mrs. Engel, the widow of George Engel, and who con trols the disposal of the body of Louis Lingg, has got into a quarrel with the defense committee, and will not allow those two bodies to be buried except by the Central Labor Union, to the exclu sion of all other organizations. But the Central Labor Union has no exclusive control over the burial lot, and cannot bury the two bodies in it without the consent of the relief committee. Unless, therefore, this committee comes to an understanding with Mrs. Engel, the bodies of Engel and Lingg will not be interred to-morrow with the rest. In addition, Miss Van Zandt has expressed a desire to be buried beside Spies, and the relief committee has prom ised to gratify her wishes as far as pos sible by placing him separate from the others and leaving room for her. This, for some reason, seems to have been added to the jealousy between the two committees, and feeling runs high. One of the principal differences between the two committees is over the inscriptions on the tablets, or monuments, to be raised. The Central Labor union is said to want a fiery political inscription, while tbe relief committee appears to desire only something to commemorate the personality of the men. THE COVETED COUNTRY. Oklahoma Boomers Expect to Succeed Some Time. Wichita, Kan., Dec. 17.— E. C Cole, one of the acknowledged leaders of the Oklahoma boom in the past, has just returned from that country, accom panied by several colleagues. His trip, which lasted nearly four weeks, was made in the interest of the present movement. He is very reticent about giving information concerning the"new crusade," as it is called, but admitted that before long another great ef fort will be made to occupy the coveted country. Cole insists that their former failure Was due to information that was spread abroad concerning their move ments, adding that it will be in the fu ture their policy to act more and speak less. Capt. Couch, who is now . presi dent of the organization, stated that they are becoming thoroughly organ ized, there being a club for the further ance of the object of the movement in almost every county in Kansas, also many in Missouri " and Texas. Concerning the time for the march to be taken up.he refused to give any definite information, but it is inferred that it will be near April 1. He says the organization is more power ful than ever before, and that this win ter every effort will be made to prevail upon congress to open up the country ; but, should they refuse to do this, there is no doubt but that trouble will ensue. Couch will give the matter his personal attention this winter at Washington. : .«. 

TOOK DESPERATE CHANCES. How Several Imprisoned Sailors Got Ashore at San Francisco. San Francisco, Dec. Several days ago a sailor who was imprisoned on the English flag ship Triumph, now lying in San Francisco bay, jumped through a port hole and swam ashore, a distance of several miles." He was pur sued, but a strong gale was blowing at the time, and darkness coming on lie reached the wharves, where he would have perished. from, exhaustion but for a watchman, : who dragged him to land. His - example has caused several other sailors on the Triumph to escape. Heniy Ryder and John Stan ley, two of the crew, have performed the feat of jumping from the Triumph with $40 in their clothes.

He is receiving a number of distinguished guests, among whom are the governor and staff and many ladies of literary and social note. THE LONG AND SHORT. The Peculiar Plea of the Union ' Pacific Company. Washington, Dec. 17.— The hearing in the case of John H. Martin and H. H. Martin, of Denver, against the Southern Pacific Railroad company and roads con trolled by it, alleging violation of the long and short haul clause of the inter state law, was continued before the in terstate commerce commission to-day. Thomas R. Kimball, the general freight agent of the Union Pacific road, and W. G.Clements were called as witnesses and admitted that greater freight rates were charged between San Francisco and Denver than between San Fran cisco and Omaha and justified on the ground that the Canadian Pacific com pany, being a competitor for the busi ness to Missouri river points, compelled the Union Pacific to make a reduction in favor of those points. The Canadian Pacific being without the jurisdiction of the commission, the defendants claim that under the circumstances stated above there has been no violation of the law. Mr. Martin in his testimony stated that the discrimination was made in the interest of Kansas City. A Row With the Milwaukee. Special to the Globe. Winona, Dec. Assistant General Superintendent Case and Superintend ent Underwood, of the Milwaukee & St. Paul road, were in town to-day, and had a conference with the mayor, city engi neer and members of the council rela tive to the opening up of several streets across the road's track, to the property lying south. The rapid growth of the city has made quite a boom in city lots south of the Milwaukee track, and a large number of houses have been erected there the past year. The people living over there have made application through the council to have the streets opened. The railroad company will not open the streets across its depot grounds, but to-day made an offer to open up Franklin and Johnston streets. The council did not seem satisfied with these concessions, and no agreement has been reached in the matter. Some time ago the city council passed a reso lution authorizing the city attorney to take the necessary legal steps to compel the railway company to open a number of streets, some of which crossed the company's switching tracks and depot grounds. The matter was postponed, however, to permit a conference with the railway company. The Milwaukee & Geneva. Special to the Globe.
