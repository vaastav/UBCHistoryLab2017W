I To fliow the thoroughly bogus character 1 ol all the Ktgiittr'i pretensions to enterprise j in the matter ol news we tnay refer to the i fact that on Tuesday last it suppressed I about two-thirds of the President's mensap'. A President's mesaago is supposed to be a document of firet-class Importance ' to the public, yet here Is a paper, protendlog to lie a newspaper, that suppresses twothlnia of It, and gives up Itaepace to bogus , pedals and such like stufT In lieu ol tho j ml news ol tho day. The iNTKLUoKNcsn does not set up a great racklo about Its news. The public expect us to furnish the news and it is our business to do so. They do not expect us to publish a mutilated President's message, and that Is a performance we never Indulge In. As such nows comes to ua it goes to the public. The I.VTKixtoxNcEn has a regularly paid correspondent at AVashlngton in Us employ, ami his Instructions are to furnish the news ol the day without regard to par; ti? or politics. We are not lu tho garbling business. Our Ideas ol a newspaper reach beyond tho suppression of the news. Da. Clso.
