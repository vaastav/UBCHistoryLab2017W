"And the next day it snowed," is not a witticism in Walla Walla, where the weather man has so signally failed m bringing about a winter season. The continued attacks on President Roosevelt from every source of dissat isfied politics makes it almost certain he will have to run for office again as a sort of vindication. The term "sawing wood," as used in Walla Walla nowadays, does not carry the usual slang definition of "saying nothing." In fact there's too much said —when the wood is being sawed. Tlic "Evening Bunc" uses headlines to make it appear The Statesman mis represented Attorney Garrecht. Any intelligent person reading the Garrecht statement will easily determine other wise. Also he will discover the "Bunc" says untiling about its misrepresenta- tion of the attorney's client. It is not expected that President Roosevelt will write a special message to congress on the action of the Walla Walla police arresting a Jap, who put up the claim of being an American citi zen, with a right to blackmail other Japs not claiming legal residence. The Christinas number of Walla Wal la's new magazine, Up-To-The-Times, came out yesterday and is a credit to its publishers. The cover design is a handsome piece of work, expressive and timely. The magazine is full of good things of local and general in terest, well written and well edited. That Third District Development League lost no time in declaring the railroads subject to public and private censure because of a lack of proper in terest in the tributary country. They, should not stop at censure. Legal pro ceedings may properly follow this first solid demonstration of the public senti ment. Some months ago Dr. N. G. Blalock wa* advertising that he had not re tire,!, but hal been "chloroformed." Judging from the enthusiasm and en ergy displayed by the doctor in push ing large projects for the benefit of Walla Walla and surrounding territory that sort of "chloroforming" would do good with other men not near the hustling physician's age. Nothing can be more despicable or cowardly than an act such as that which yesterday brought grief to little Narcissa Johnson. Out of a spirit of revenge a schoolmate telephoned a newspaper the statement that the girl was engaged to wed a playmate. It was false and Waa published without proper investigation. But corrections and apologies do not assuage the suf fering of the little victim. Nothing should be left undone in searching for the culprit. It's all over. We are through with "thru." We are not so close to "dost" and have "busted up" on "wisht."

Ignorance of the system used In con ducting the editorial department of a newspaper permits of many false im pressions which, when bolstered by personal animosities, give occasion for assumptions generally far from the truth. Hasty conclusions thus drawn are often rank injustices, particularly to the individuals employed on news papers. Such is the case out of which grows an anonymous communication in the Union this morning, written ostensibly by a student of Whitman college, as suming to speak for the student body, and attacking one of the members of the editorial staff of The Statesman in a manner subject, assuredly, to severe criticism. No better demonstration of the lack of knowledge of how a news papers is conducted could be given than in the reckless accusations made against an individual member of the staff of this paper. The fact that the letter was anonymous leads to the assumption that a person most con cerned was the author. No one reporter or employe of The Statesman is responsible for a per fected story appearing in these col umns. The story may be written by a reporter, edited by another man and the head written by a third. Such was the procedure in the case referred to. The story was written under orders. If it had not been written by one re porter another - would have taken his place and composed it. The reporter who wrote it saw the heading for the first time when the paper came off the press. - The attempt to give the impression of personal feeling, or inject person alities into the matter, is wrong and calculated to do an injustice to one who is in every way a gentleman, who is thoroughly loyal to his alma mater and whose record there will prove | greater services done to the splendid institution which educated him than can be shown by any anonymous writ ers to rival newspapers. If a story appears in The Statesman which can be proved incorrect, this pa per will gladly and cheerfully make the necessary and proper corrections. Until such proofs are forthcoming it will continue to have the utmost con fidence in the integrity, honor and truthfulness of those of its employes who have so frequently demonstrat ed their right to such esteem. j And it will require more than an ir responsible, anonymous communication to destroy that confidence. 

CONSOLIDATION IN RELIGION. The spirit of consolidation is in the air. It is the supreme economic and social tendency of the times. Even the churches have been attacked by it and certainly there is much to be said for the movements now in the making for the consolidation of denominations whose beliefs are practically identical. One of the latest projects in this direction is that which committees of the Congregational, United Brethren and Methodist Protestant churches are striving to work out. The last named church, by the way, should not be con fused with the much larger and quite distinct denomination the Methodist Episcopal church. Committees appoint ed to formulate conditions of union have recently reported. One commit tee has perfected a plan for consolidat ing the publishing work of all three churches and syndicating much of the material, without affecting the formal eixstence of present incorporations or interfering with educational institu tions. Another proposes a plan of pol ity whereby the communicants shall be organized In district associations, an nual conferences and a national council to meet quadrennially. In this way it is expected that complete fusion will in the end be attained. The tendency of the religious denom inations to "get together" is one of the most hopeful signs of the times. Competition i s desirable in business, but in religion cooperation is better. In the Barnyard. "I hate to see a hen," said the pig bitterly. "It always makes me think of bacon and eggs."

HEAR WHAT WILLIE HAS TO SAY Kaiser Speaks Through Talking Ma chine and His Words Are to be Preserved. BERLIN, Dec. 14.—The phonograph ic record recently made at the instance of the German emperor, who wishes it preserved in the German museum of Harvard university and in the Con gressional library in Washington, con tains the following words from the mouth of the German sovereign: "We must be strong in time of dis tress; never desire the unobtainable or things of no value. "We must accept the day as it is and seek for good in everything; be satis fied with human nature and mankind as they are and be happy even In the darkest hours if we only can find a moment of joy. "We must work and act, even if no immediate benefit should result from it. "Any one adopting this policy will be free, happy and enterprising, and his life will be beautiful. "Mistrusting man is always unjust toward others and wrongs himself. "The world is very large and its in habitants very small, so that they can't expect everything to cause their exclusive personal advancement. "There is no one can assert that when sorrows are met with they are not necessary for the rest of creation. "The will of God is reflected in ev erything, and we w T eak human beings do not possess sufficient knowledge to understand it. "The world is as it should be and, no matter what happens, we must recog nize the will of God is everything." Emperor William's activity was nev er better illustrated than during a re cent indisposition. Though confined to his bed in the palace at Potsdam, he continued to receive his ministers, sign papers and documents and transact all state business from beneath the cover lets. It is said that he and his family rather enjoy such forced confinement, because then they can lead a more in timate and familiar life. GIRLS HAD LOOKED TOO LONG. On the Booze When It Was Scintillat in the Stein. Two girls were picked up by the po lice at a late hour last night and taken to the police station and after being given a severe reprimand they were taken home. The girls, who are not more than 13 years old, were found near the corner of Sixth and Rose streets and one of them was very much under the influence of liquor. A brother of one of the young women was trying his best to get his sister to go home. After the authorities arrested the girls one of them was made to go with her brother while an officer escorted the other to her home. , j Aimuseimeinits "PEGGY FROM PARIS." "Peggy From Paris," George Ade's merry musical play which has scored distinct hits and achieved long runs in New York, Boston, and Chicago, will be the attraction at the Keylor Grand next Saturday, Dec. 15, when it will be offered by the only organiza tion which is appearing in this suc cessful melodious comedy. Hence, theater patrons will be certain of the excellence of the company and the richness and beauty of the production. "Peggy from Paris" is one of the most popular musical plays ever produced, a fact known to all persons who are in touch with the theater. There is no , doubt of its wit and merriment for its author is George Ade, the famous humorist, whose writings have delighted readers in this country and abroad. It ; has been said of the play that it con tains much of Mr. Ade's cleverest wit and satire. That it furnishes abundant enjoyment is proven by the fact that it ran four months in New York, five months in Boston and three in Chica go. Critics and public unite in pay ing tribute to its brightness and gaiety its originality, its clever character portrayals and its droll and amusing situations and incidents.

One is laughing unre strainedly at the comedy when a burst of melody precludes a capitivating air and the comedians and commediennes from saying funny things turn to singing catchy songs, most of them well seasoned with merriment, allot the captivating, and their delight en hanced by scores of pretty chorus girls who sing and dance in alluring measure. J. A. Raynes wrote the mu sic for "Peggy from Paris." "Peggy From Paris" will be one of the nota ble engagements of the season in this city, and admirers of all that is best in musical comedy will wish to hear it. WITH PLEASING EFFECTS. "A Little Outcast," that much talked of production, will be seen at the Key lor Grand, Sunday, Dec. 16. It comes with a wealth of scenery and tons of electrical appliances for those bewild ering effects which have been aston ishing theater goers. The play itself, is a pretty, natural story, all warmth and grace and singular originality; the kind of play to captivate all sorts and conditions of men and women. The play opens in the office of Mr. Harcourt, a wealthy broker, who is about to take his clerk, Paul Weston, into the firm as junior partner. Inci dentally, Weston has won the heart of the broker's pretty daughter, Mad i eline, and has wedded her secretly. Mr. 1 Harcourt approves of him, and the young pair agree to announce their mariage that evening, when the part | nership papers are signed. But be i fore evening, De Voe, the broker's i graceless nephew, who had hoped to jbe both son-in-law and partner of his' uncle, learns a dark secret in Weston's career, and plans the young man's downfall. He discovers that, years be fore, Weston has served a states prison sentence for another's crime, and De Voe chanced to be present when Wes ton is recognized by "Red" Darby, a former cell mate. In buying the man's silence, Weston becomes involved in a money transaction, and is denounced by De Voe, who is the real culprit, to Mr. Harcourt, as an ex-convict and a thief. He is utterly cast off by the broker, and Madeline is ordered to for get him. Branded as a thief, and for saken by his former friends, Weston becomes an easy prey to drink, until he falls to the level of habitual drunk ards and consorts with criminals and outcasts. At the darkest part of his ca reer, on the eve of committing a great crime, Weston is brought to a sudden realization of his situation, and his better nature asserts itself. His re demption and ultimate triumph over his enemies, is accomplished by a se ries of powerful dramatic incidents, in all of which the faithful newsboy "Bob" is his trusted ally, and the curtain falls on a happy home scene, where Weston is restored to his friends' confidence, and to his wife's love, receives the spontaneous cheers of the audience, which is ever ready to applaud the triumph of virtue and good will. A number of novel characters are in troduced, among them being a new type of "dope fiend" in the person of "Quinn" a once brilliant lawyer, who, when under the influence of the drug, raves in every language but his own, and is, in his own words, "As the gods" knowing good and evil, but untouched by either."
