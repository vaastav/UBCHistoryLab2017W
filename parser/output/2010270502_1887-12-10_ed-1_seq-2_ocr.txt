Congress convened Monday and both houses immediately organized without difficulty, there being no fghtinthe Senate as was antici pated. Carlisle was elected speaker of the house. The organization of the Senate was witnessed' by Presi dent Cleveland and most of the di plomatic delegations. The anarchists will hold a meet ing in Chicago to-morrow to ex press their adherance to the cause, the proceeds to go to the widows and orphans of the gentlemen who lately died for murdering police men. The mayor declined to give them the privilege of selling beer. As without this indispensible bever age, the receipts would be trifling and the proceedings tame indeed, it may naturally be supposed the or der created much dissatisfaction amnncr them. It is not likely the courts will restrain the mayor. Tire Gmjrlte.-Journal voices the sentiment of many of Mr. Blaine's old friends in Nebraska when it ars that its oDnosition is based j . upon expediency and not upon per sonal hostility. No where in the United States is Mr. Blaine held higher among his political asso ciates than in Nebraska, and there is no one whom his admirers would rather see in the presidential chair, but they fear that to nominate him will be taking unnecessary chances. If he is the choice of the conven tion however, he can count on 30.000 majority in Nebraska. Walt Mason, the 'poet of the Journal, was up to Omaha living with the incarcerated councilmen. He apparently didn't appreciate the the grub furnished by the sheriff, for on his return he thus discourses on bills of fare: "Some day an enterprisiug aud intellectual hotel proprietor will edit and publish a bill of fare in which the queen's English will be used instead o'f illegitimate French and imitation Italian. Nothing de prives a man of his appetite quicker than to tackle a bill of fare which he cannot read. When the hotel keener in ciuestion makes himself known he will be escorted around town by a brass band." The new President or h ranee is named Sadi-Garnot, a moderate lib eral republican, but not much known outside of France. His elec tion was a hard blow to the mper ialists and monarchists, who thought tbpv saw in the political crisis of J L ifchp fame a chance to advance their favorite form of government a step. The time for the return of the monarchy or the empire now seems more remote than ever. In the United States we have never had much faith in the stability of the French Republic. The people or at least those of Paris, and they say Paris is France are too impulsive. we might say light-headed. There is an apparent lack of that solid na ture of character peculiar to the Encrlish.

TliorA will not lie less liberty, but restraints unon license, while w - flip fWnra of government will be administered by stronger hands. ternal taxes. Mr. Cleveland argues that' tobacco and liquors are not necessities, therefore the people pay this tax of fifty million dollars cheerfully. We admit that they are not absolute necessaries of life, but they are consumed largely by poor people and the tax does not lessen the consumption. These taxes are not popular, and often work, hardships, especially the-Vtaiion toi J I "' y ' ' oacco, which is repungent to our in stitutions. They are relics of war measures and should long since have been stricken from the statue book. There is no necessity for a tax on to bacco, while municipalities under state laws can tax liquor all that is required. Rapeal those laws and then adjust the tariff if necessary. One of the results of the troubles in umcago is tne prepara tion of a bill which will "be submit- ted to congress tins session, con taining provisions for sending out of the country such aliens as are dissatisfied with our government and are continually making trouble. The 'only difficulty with the bill is not comprehensive enough for prac tical .use. With an amendment or two the object of the bill could be more' easily attained. To send foreign, agitators back to. the coun try from which they came would not put nn end to the trouble, for at home they would continue to talk and act as they do here and the germs of sedition would naturally come back to us. A good plan would be for all the powers to com bine in the purchase of some island or uninhabited country and. to set it apart for the reception of those dissatished persons to be found in every country; in other words, to found a kingdom of anarchy where the apostles or anarchy and ninii- ism could have just such a govern ment or rather no government at all, as they now advocate. The czar has a large number of subjects of whom he would gladly get rid, Emperor William has a few, Queen Vic. a tew more, France could add to the quota and the number lack ing could easily be furnished from our own country. With all these discontented spirits transplanted to some one designated spot, the dream of Johann Most would find a most startling fulfilment anarchy would reign supreme. New brumea has been suggested as a fitting place for the experiment, it already having an appropriate designation in the words, No Mans Land. btate Journal. The President's Message. President Cleveland's message is a very unique document. It treats of omly one subject, the tariff, and is a- free trade argument from beginning to end. There is not a word about reducing internal taxes; not a word .kAnf iho arniv or navy, the settle- monf nf the fisheries question or of oar relations with foreign powers. For information under these heads congress is refered to the reports of heads of departments, except that of Secretary of State, which will in due time form the subject of another communication. The mes sage is plain and outspoken; there is no diplomacy about the language, mo beating around the bush that an uLa mav be inferred rather than v.-w- expressed. In this Mr. Cleveland is perhaps to be commended. Taking mlthe whqle, however, it has more; - tie character ot a stump speech i3; vtJan that of a state paper. rhut- nnr rvpnnps should lift rp- 1 iUW V"1 ' - diced to the requirraents of the government all will agree.

R. has expressed himself as heartily in sympathy with the pen sion bill prepared by that organ iza- tion, ana predicts mac in win re ceive the necessary support and be come a law. This bill, similar in many respects to the service pen sion bill vetoed last year by Presi dent Cleveland, provides, among other things, for pensioning that large class of invalid soldiers whose circumstances are such that they cannot prove, satisfactorily, that they are entitled to a pension. Many cases exist where it is well known by friends that the disabil ity of the applicant for pension was caused by the exposure of army life, but where the lapse of time renders it impossible to bring con clusive proof of the facts in the case. The death of a single man whose affidavit on a pension appli cation has been demanded, has been known to defeat the issues of the order to place the applicant's name upon the pension roll. Changes in residence have often operated to ac complish the same undesirable re sult. In view of these facts, legis lation is needed to sanction less rigorous requirements than now prevail in establishing a claimant's right to the relief he asks. It is but a matter of simple justice to the defenders of the nation in time of peril. -5- Russia's action in massing troops on the Austrian and German fron tiers is regarded with considerable alarm in Germany The reason for this action is given by Russia to be a precaution to guard against sur prise and attack should Austria-and Germany niake - common cause against her. The cause for4his ap prehension on the part of Russia is unknown, and the action taken seems to be exactly opposite in its nature to that which might have been expected so soon after the late satisfactory conference between the czar aud Bismarck. A solution of these seemingly unwarranted move ments may possibly be found in the situation of France. Whatever the meaning may be, or what the cause of the military activity in Russia, the continental situation had such an appearance yesterday as to mate rially effect European markets. A misunderstanding seems to ex ist in some quarters regarding the case or senator Turpie of Indiana, to the seating of whom some objec tion was made before the convening of congress. The contest was not dismissed by the fact that Mr Tur pie took the oath of officej but the republican senators allowed this course to be pursued -in order to facilitate onranization. The com mittee on privileges and elections now has charge of the matter, will examine the evidence, the evidence produced by the contestant and con testee and report findings to the senate, which will then decide whether Mr. Turpie is entitled to hold his seat.

New York, Dec. 7. The Tri bune says: The president's mes sage was a disappointment to Wall street. It had been supposed it would treat of other matters than the tariff, and would make positive recommendations on several sub jects. The general opinion seemed to be that the message was remark able chiefly by neglect of impor tant objects outside ot the tariff. In this respect the free trade utter ances or the message were not en tirely offset bv the concluding state ment, "the question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant. An active broker, speaking of the messat said: "It reminds me of the daily letter which we send out to our cus tomers. I usualllv write it, and frequently, after I have demonstrat ed that stocks ought to advance, 'hedge' by suggesling that in spite of these influences prices may de cline."
