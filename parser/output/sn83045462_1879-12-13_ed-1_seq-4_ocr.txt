Ta STAR has a direct wire from its news room to the Western Union Telegraph offie in New York eity, from which wires radiate to all parts of the globe, and is therefore anabled to secure the latest ews by Its own operator from every quarter up to within a few moments of going to press. It is the only evening paper south of Philadelphia which re edyes exclusively the Associated Press dispatches. Facts have recently come to light which prove that In entering upon the bolt against Tilden and Robinson, In New York, Tammany had the pounsel and support of some of the most eminent leaders of the democracy in the - state. Chief Justice Church, of the Appeals Court, and Senator Kernan, among others, countenanced the movement. Mr. S. S. Cox said to a representative of THE BrAn yesterday: "The democrats outside of New York have never understood that move ment, nor do they appreciate the necessity that existed for It. It was essential to party success next year. Tilden would not get out of the way, and we had to put our knives Into him. We could have done it with twice as many votes as were cast against Robinson if It had been necessary. We had the best men in the party, in the city and outside of it, to count upon.' The democrats who inspired the bolt in order to "kill Tilden" will never consent to any compro mise with him. Tilden has, within the last few days, directed his party agents to hold on to the organization and "control the delegation to the national convention." The fight between the two factions continues, and the outlook for the New York democrats is not hopeful. The state officers chosen at the late election in New York were very quietly declared elected yesterday by the board of canvassers, so that all the anxiety about "counting out" was un necessary. The board decided that they had no power to go behind the returns to correct al p t leged Irregularities. Mr. Seymour was the only democrat who was found to have been elected. The Maine canvass remains to agitate the peo ple. Another southern democratic Congressman has created a "decided flutter" in political IIrcles by cutting himself loose from party ties. skptesentative Alken, of South Carolina, in a 3.tter to a friend, says "the time has come for a is-w deal politically;" that both the political 1artles have outlived their usefulness and should t,e wiped out; "that the word democratiI is as hateful to the people of the north as 'repub lican' Is to those of the south." Mr. Aiken is satisfied that the democrat does not live who can carry either New York or Indiana, and he advises the Industrial elements north and south to take the field with a party and ticket of their own. There are other southern Congressmen who, like Mr. Alken, have very little hope of democratic success next year, but this does not indicate that they will desert their party with out one more trial. The democrats will, no doubt, be able to hold the south together for 1880, but after that the division and disruption will come, no matter which party may win. The handsome display of holiday advertise ments Is one of the most attractive features of to-day's STaR. The best houses in the city are represented. There was no chance for "ent erprising" jour nlaits to get possession of and prematurely publish President's messages In the early days of the Republic. Presidents Washington and Adams delivered their messages in person to Congress, and Mr. Jefferson was the first to de ptrt from this custom. He turned the annual "address" into an annual message and sent it to Congress, a precedent that has been followed by all his successors. In sending his first mes Rage to Congress he wrote to the President of the Senate as follows: "The circumstances under which we find our selves placed rendering inconvenient the mode heretofore practiced of making by personal ad. dress the first communication between the leg Nlative and executive branches, I have adopted that by message, as used upon all subsequent occasfons through the session. In doing this I have had principal regard to the convenience of the legislature, to the economy of their time, to their relief from the embarrassment of immedl ate answers on subjects not yet fully before tiem, and to the benefits thence resulting to the public affairs. Trusting that a procedure founded on these motives will meet their appro bation, I beg leave through you, sir, to com municate the enclosed message, with the dhcu ments accompanying it, to the honorable the Senate. and pray you to accept for yourself and them the homage of my high respect and con aideratlon." The Wilmington Erery Erening "stands ready to prove the falsity of the absurdly false story" that Senator Bayard was once a "captain in the rebel army." 'ThPre are twelve men now confined in the Tombs awaiting trial for murders committed in New York city. Some of the city papers aye ca11ing for a "little less law and a little more justice," but It is not justice that the prisoners want. There are 138 new advertisements In THE
