A one-pupil school, and that pupi' in attendance but twice in three weeks, is the report of a public school teacher in Oneida, N. Y. "Sinecure" no longer lacks a definition. At a recent bicycle exhibit in England all American wheels were barred. There is but ono conclusion to bo drawn from this, and that is that our manufacturers are making a superior wheel. The time when Americans had tc send to Europe for what was best in mechanical pro? ducts is long since past, and tc-day, in cutlerv, fire-arms, watches, and in fact into whatever human skill and brain mechanism enters, Auitrica is an easy first nmong the nations of the'worl;!. The announcement by the students of the University of Virginia for a called meeting to reorganize the movement put on foot last commencement, in order that plans may be devised for a Poe memorial, will be noted with plcnsurt; by tho alumni ot that institution. Poe is ensily her most distinguished alumnus, and it is almost past belief that the University has not long ugo taken some steps to commeniorate.eitlier in architecture or in marble, the goo-like genius of her alum? nus, whose poetic lire, extinguished all too soon, burned with a brilliancy that has been approached by few and sur? passed by none. With Pnris for a radial point, all France for the past week has been in a state^of frenzied excitement,such ns only ^Frenchmen can rise to, over the Dreyfus case. It really begins to '.nok'as though the youug oOicer has been the victim of a conspiracy of the foulest sort.and already from being a by-word and a reproach among men, ho is fast becoming a [popu? lar idol. The circle of sympathy has widened until it has even touched Amer? ican shores, a branch of tho National Ba varian Union in Baltimore bavin e just completed an organization for the pur? pose of attesting their belief in his inno? cence and pledging him their aid in every way possible to secure him justice. Should it really turn out that Dreyfus is' innocent, li^s return will lie given an ova? tion in Paris, such no has never been wit? nessed since the tin CS of Napoleon. Amongst people of so volatile a tempera? ment who can tell how high, politically, such a wave of popular enthusiasm might lift, him? France, her enthusiasm once aroused, never does things in a half way manner. As was to be expected,the criticisms oi the President's message by the press of the countiy Is favorable or adverse, ac? cording to the political standpoint of the paper. It. is. however, noticeable that not even the stauchest organs of the Re? publican p'irty are wildly enthusiastic over it. Even a superficial reading of it will convince one that the message lacks strength and firmness, and all the ques? tions of great moment, the currency question perhaps excepted, are treated witli indecision, no policy save a half? hearted and temporising one being out? lined on any given subject. The message' itself, so far as its English is concerned, is remarkal ly terse and clear, reminding one very much in this respect of his pred? ecessor, whose messages were always models ?.f English composition. That Wall street is jubilant over the message and that stocks took an upward leap by reason of it, is no reason why the coun? try or. huge should feel the sr.me spirit of elation. In speculative circles Mr. Mc? Kinley'? midget will be hailed :e n grand success. The Scientific American has quite a lengthy article, witli cuts, illustrating the school fire drill as practiced iu the Cambridge,Mass.,manual school for boys. It seems that some sort of systematic drill or exeicise must be provided now in all large schools, as a sort of escape valve for youthful eO'ervesence, and here, Liver Ills like biliousness, dyspepsia, headache, consti? pation, sour stomach, indigestion are promptly cured by Hood's rills. They do their work Hood's easily and thoroughly. ggfc ? E B <xt TL.?* nflnr illnnnr rillt?. iMfir ? ? H C?

SHIVERING STJHOOL DHILDREN. Prcf. Sbeppe, 'principal' of the Com? merce street school, in Ins reply in yes? terday's Times to the card of Col. Lock ett, calling attention to the fact that tho children of the public schools are forcod to stand on the streets until the doors are opened, durl.lg tdl sorts of] weather, shows t hat he isactingstrictly within the limits ot school regulations. The q" tion, however, is whether those wdio framed these rulesand regulations cannot devise some p'an by which such a neces? sity can be avoided. We know that there are many difficulties in the way of 'his. Until the teachers are in their rooms, It would not do to let the children pour pell-mell into them. Then, again, many of cur public school children come from homes that are rarely comfortable,and to fix the hour at which they are allowed to assemble in school, at an earlier one, would be to see these same children still ahead of time, standing shivering ou the ' streets. To require the teachers to be present at an earlier hour t'jan they now are would be to impose additional work upon.those who already have as much as they can do. These are some of the diffi? culties iu the way; but at the same time, to compel children who may arrive at school before the hour of opening, whet her it be purposely or .inadverteutly,? to ie main outside in the rain or snow, or even Ofi a clear but cold day, is certainly not right. As a rule, these early comers will be found to be from the homes of our pooler people, and to their thinly clad bodies the unnecessary exposure of even ' five minutes" in a raw east wicd may mean u spell of sickness. This is a mat? ter wo have frequently heard bitterly complained of, and iu one instance, whether correct or not, a case of pneu? monia was charged directly to this cause. In lieu of anything better, we would oiler the following suggestion, applicable at least to the Commerce street school, which Is steam neated. The janitor is necessarily on the premises at an early hour. Let the lower rooms bo kept locked uutll the teachers arrive aud in? struct ihe janitor to tdlow tne children who may come before that time,the priv? ilege of the balls, which are usually com? fortable, and which are large enough to accommodate such as come before the ar? rival of the teachers. Whether such a plan could be adopted at the other build? ings we do not know. The whole ques? tion is a much vexed one, and has always given tho same trouble iu al' our larger cltles.but we do not know what expedient they adopt to remedy it. For Infants and Children.

THIEF TO < 'A TCI I A THIEF. President Diaz, of Mexico, is credited with tho invention of an ingenious method of ridding the country of bandits, iuclud'ug train rol bers, which is work? ing like a char-*'. A desperado of more thun common intelligence was captured about, two years ago. and the President interviewt] bun in prison several times. The bandit, told him t hat want of occupa? tion was at thefoot ol , the whole, trouble. The President, said: "I will test you. You shall be liberated,and I will appoint you chief of police in your native district. You aie to guard all trains, [und protect, passengers at the way stations. You can appoint your own suborainatea from your to)lowers. You will be rewarded for maintaining good order ln"yonr district, and held responsible for all 'lawless acts by whomsoever committed." There has not been a robbery In that district (which was formerly a dn.tgerous one for ionrists to pass throughJ since that appoint incut ivas made. The system has been extended, and now the solitary uniformed policeman on tin platform of nearly every small station iu .Mexico is an ex robber. l'e is known.and respected as a superior person by the pecna and loafers, who know thai ho will permit no petty thieving. He. in turn, knows thai he is d'-scly watched by a superior officer who is in the employ of the chief ix bandit.

In Greensboro Saturday Night?A Strong Talk of Lynching. The ftllcwing will uc dcubt interest fronds cf the murderer in Koanoke. Winston Sentinel: One of the most hor l ible and cold blooded murders ever per? petrated in this S{ate was that at Greens? boro Saturday evening when Sonly Ryan, a trilling fugitive from justice, shot and killed h's wife because she hail refused to turu over to him $11, *vhich she had just collected from her boarders. Mrs. Ryan was passing noross the street from her residence to a grocery store to pay a bill when'the brute came suddenly upon her, seized her throat ami demanded the money. Her refusal caused fclm to draw a pistol and (ire two balls into her body. Tho itrst entered her head and the other the breast. Death was al mort instantaneous. Not satisfied by this dastardly deed,the fiend turned upon Iiis daughter, who was rushing to her mother's rescue,and would have shot her but for tho appearance of several men running to tho scene. The wife-murderer disappeared doIV11 an alley. Still thirsting foi blood he went to Frazier's hardware store and attempted to shoot County Treasurer liodgen, against whom he had ,'a grudge. When captured he said tie had attempted to shoot himself and showed a print of the pistol muzzle on his temple. '1 he pistol, he said, failed to fire. A brother of the dead wife came upon the oflicers witli their prisotier and would have killed hin with a shotgun but lor the intervention ol bysl Inders. There is much indignation among Greensboro cit? izens and theie is talk of a lyucliiuu.

ANTI-FOOTBALL BILL \ ETOED. Atlanta. Pec. 8.?-Qovtruor Atkinson yesterday evening vetoed the inti-foothall hill. lie sent a message to the hou.-e Stating that he had vetoed the measure, as he thought tin* question of whether college boys should play football should be left with the faculties of the various institutions. Ii Is possible an effort will be made to p?ss the measute over the governor's head,but it is not at all likely that such an enort will succeed. It has been stated that Mrs. Yon Gammon, mother of the football player who was killed iu the University of Virginia game ngain?) the University of Georgia, had aski (1 the governor to veto the measure.

At this time of the year a cob' is very easily contracted, and if left to run its course without the aid of some reliable cough medicine is liable to result, in that dread disease, pneumonia. We know of no better remedy to cure a cough or cold than Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. We have use ii quite extensively ami it has always given ent ire satisfaction. -Olngah, Ind. Ter., Chief This is the only remedy tint is known to he a certain preventive of pneumonia. Among the many thousands who have used it for colds and In grippe, we have never yet learned of a single case having resulted in pneumonia. Persons who have weak lungs or have reason to fear an attack of pneumonia should keep the remedy al hand. The 25 and 60 cent, slze.s for salt by II, C. Barnes, ''he puls up THE PENSION OCTOPUS. Swallows Nearly One-Half of the Federal Revenue. From tiu* Now York Sun: For tins first time since tlie jreiisiim appropriations be? gun to assume enormous proportions it seems certalu that thu subject win re? ceive proper and earnest attention from Congress. It begins to lie sein tii.it a pcusivti list which thirty t wo years alter the close of the war clo.-ely approximates half the total numb"r of three-year en? listments, and which is still rapidly growing, demands serious conslderation. It is a case .vhere the assistanco is needed of the veterans who sprang to arms iu 1801, before pensions or bounties were talked ol or thought of. Their aid is a patriotic duty, now as ihe.i. They owe it to themselves to frown upon unworthy pent-loners on the rolls and unworthy up plica ii ts. '1 he pension roll now far exceeds the membership of all the patriotic societies ol veterans which the war created: iu fact, is considerably mure than double the membership of all of them?Grand Army of the Republic, Union Veteran Legion. Union Veterans' Union. Military Order of the Loyal Legion, Society of the Army of the Potomac, Society of the Army of the James, Soc ety of the Army ol the Tennessee, Society of the Army of West Virginia, and the Society of tho Army ot the Cumberland. Turning from the contemplation of numbers to the consideration of the cost, it appears that next year's expenditures for pensions will require mort than half the ye uly icceipts as calculated upon those of the month just closed. Tho present estimate la that.the roll will cost $1.10,000,000. To put the matter in stil! more striking form, ]this annual outlay will iii|tiiie $32,000,000 more than the total receipts Irom customs, estimated upon those of the month of November last as an avenge. If this annual ex? pense be compared with the internal rev? enue receipts estimated o-' the same basis, it. is found that, the entire reveuue from this source, with the exception of ?12.000,000, wiil be required to pay the pension roll. Loosed at iu another shape: if a line could he forme' equal in length to one made up of all the_three-yenr veterans of the war and every other man should bo advanced a pace to' the front, the num? bers in either line would then mit slightly exceed those ou the pension roll, ami mote than every other dollar or the gov? ernment revenue would be required to pay it. More st art line stiii does the magnitude of t'ds pens on payment appear when its amount Is compared with the items of aunnul appropriations. These in round numbers were'the appropriations for the current fiscal yeai: Legislative, ?7 713,000; "executive prop! r. $200 000; Stute. $2.109.000; Treas? ury, $32,200,000; war. $?8,073.000; navy, $3:1,554.000; postofbee, $939,000; interior except pensions, $15,012,000: agriculture, $3.1e8.000; jns'ice, $0,120.000; labor. $174,000: pensions. $l4i.204p900; total, $302,585,000; totals without pension*. $101,321.000; penfeious for next yenr,$130, 000,(100. It will bo seen Irom these 'figures that if tleooi of Cotieres--,tbe printing olbce, the library and the botanic igarden. ex? pressed in ihe item legislative, and the i?giiculturnl department be taken out of the above,column the pensions lor next year will rqutl the tctal cost of the re? maining government service. That is to say. the cost of pensions will, with thi small except ions noted, 'equal the entire salary list of the Government iu Wash? ington nnd throughout the country, the expenses of hII the departments, includ? ing the whole judicial system, the cost of the army and navy, postoffice deficien? cies, pUblic buildings, fortifications, and ships, livers and harbors,the department ? if labor, and the whole expense of the White House and its salaries. A long array ol prominent items, such as those for the coast survey, the life-saving ser? vice, the light house system, the Indian service, the general land oflice, the Ma? li lie Hospital service, the national Sol- ? liters' Homes, the customs service, which i are included in the above figures, might be added t,? still further emphasize the J point under ci moderation. Such compaiisons as these have at last 1 attracted the attention which they do j serve, and Washington upon the eve of | tho opening of Congress in full ?u ta'k based upon such presentation of the .sub? ject. Pension reform has been a question which for years has been forcing Itself upon the attention of Congressmen. It I has been put aside from year to y ?ar be- 1 cause, from motives which are easily un- I derstood, autl which have innen to com- j mend them, there was a general dispnst- | lion to provide for the growing' burden rather than seem ever, to be turning the i cold shoulder to veterans. Hut with a pensiou expenditure re (Hiring more than | half ti.e present yearly revenues, and at a time when these revenues, :ir; falling many millions below the total annual ex? penditures, the question becomes one 'n volving nut only justice to the old sol? dier, but fairness to the rest of the nu l ion. There is no dissent worth consideration from the proposition thit if $150,000,000 is fairly due to soldiers, or those who liav been or are dependent upon them on account of disabilities incurred 'in tho service, every cent of it should be promptly paid. Further than this there Is a goueral assent to t ic proposition that the government owes to all who weie' Ms nbled and impoverished by the casualties of the service, not the mere pittance which so many of those now receive, hul a sum. which, with other means that the pensionei may be able to command, would lift him and those depending upon him above want. There Is a growing feeling that the pen? sions enjoyed by many thousands who are iu lull health, find comfortably fixed in life, .should be terminated, and the Government be thus enabled to more nearly discbarge itsduty toward the help? less and the miserable. If the pension list could be nriuted, every community iu the land would be 4paj
