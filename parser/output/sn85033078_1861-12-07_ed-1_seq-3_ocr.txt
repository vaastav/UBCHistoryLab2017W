X.” get bis, what d’ye call it? Has not J. X. heafd of Samp son and the “Foxes with the Brand* The Stone Fleet. —What is known as the “atone fleet” consists of 25 old whaling ships, having an aggregate tonnage of 8,377 tons, and carrying 7,841t0ns of stone. The vessels are to be scuttled and be sunk in the water approaches to the Sohthern ports. It is estimated that a dozen of these ships judiciously disposed will effectually block all the water entrances to Savan* nah, and the rest will completely close some other port. By this plan the block ade squadron will, one after another be relieved and enabled to accompany the naval expeditions. A gun boat or two will be sufficient to watch any port thus blockaded and prevent the removal of the obstructions. We pre sume the -efficiency of the blockade will soon be demonstrated to the satis action of Jaff. Davis. Our cold weather has gone up and a more mild genial temper ature threatens to unloose the icy fetters oi the old Wisconsin. The little snow we boasted of has well nigh disappear, ed. We hope for a freeze. ZD
