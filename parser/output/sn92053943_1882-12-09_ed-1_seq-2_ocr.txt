Referring to the eriod of Fraud Hayes, President Arthur, in his message, speaks of it as ''the four years immediately pre ceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the pres idency." Hayes will go on record before many years as the chief of political thieves, as be ertainlyis.

It is downright attempt to thwart, the "will of the people as expressed at the ballot-box. The people of Rock Island county gave an emphatic expression of the . purpose and wish to build a county hospital, ai d voted $ 30.000 for that particular object. The Argcs cares, not a single . rush-light whether or cot the "legislature may at the session of 1882-8 enact . a law providing " for the care of -the insane of the state." The board of super visors have nothing whatever to do with the matter. ISobody .asted them a ques tion on the sub jtct, and their action is a srratuitous assumption of a power not vested in them. They should and must be taught to understand that the people voted a sum of money to "build a county hospital," and their late action is only a high banded ruse to defeat the will of the people. 

WASHINGTON LETTEK. From onr regular correspondent. Washington, D. C, Dec. 6, 1883. There was an uncommonly slim attend ance of representatives at the ... opening of congress on Monday the slimmest I have seen in my eight year's observation here. The laggards are always numerous at the beginning of a session, in years when there is no speakership to settle, but what it was that kept such an unusual number behind this year can hardly be explained, . unless Speaker Keifer's ruling that 11 o'clock should be the hour was too much for them. People who work from sunrise to sunset will have some difficulty in comprehending the tardiness of congressman who finds 11, or even 12 o'clock too early for him to be in his seat, but there are many of them. The greetings among members of both parties were unusually cordial. . The cheer fulness of the day appeared to dwell on the democratic side, as they discussed what they would io in the next congress. .Every one was curious to note the manner and demeanor of the defeated members who were represented in such large numbers upon the floor. Robeson, upon whom the eves of the gallery were often centert-d. was very active going about among bio colleagues, ana no one would Dave inferred from his manner that he is an intensely disappointed man. He did not extend many of his calls to the democratic side, probably because of the jokes and chaffing he met with there. ju.uch of the talk among members on the republican side was made up of explanations by those who had been defeated for re-election of the peculiar causes which led to that result. Jay Hubbell was one f the absentees. In running over the republican side . the flsrures most sought after- by the ' galleries were the diplomatic and courtly Kasxon. the strudv and vigorous Father Kelley, the judicious and ever alert Robinson, of Massachusetts, Mr. Robeson and SpemkejrH Ketf erf L pon the t democratic side tae candidates far the next speakership jg.re t$e main objects of attention. They were all on hand Monday. Carlisle and Randall were the most dignified of these gentlemen remaining at their desks to receive callers. Is one of the candidates we;e so agile , and so effusive us the genial Springer, who in the course of thirty or forty minutes, em braced every democratic voter in the house. On the senate side of the capitol the ex change of pleasant greetings, comparison of notes about the past , fall's, campaign and other subj-cts kept up a perfect buzz of conversation in the chamber. As is usual on the first day of a session, every body was in good humor, The chamber, with the handwome .new carpet .lately laid, new chairs and desks, .freshly varnished, wore a bright - an&'cletmJyipearaDce. Some of ihu -desks were decorated with make good use of their limited time and talents. The president's message was re ceived here with varying degrees of criti cism and. approval, but the preponderance of sentiment s that while u does not rank as one of tua ablest of thestate papers, it was nererthete constructed withr great deal of fihrevdness. so as i touch; a popular chord upon ail the various ques tions concerning which the people have lately expressed themselves, and he steals awav from the democrats a (rood deal of their loudest thunder. There was not the usual experience of printing the' message ali over the country . before it was Bent -to congrcbs. A rumor was current in news paper row Saturday niht that a copy of the message t ad been procured -and was for saltv-to correspondent desiring it. One or two. I believe, were taken in by this bogus copy, bat when President ! Arthur heard the rumor he sent word that he would like to get a copy himself,; as his own message was not finished, and this might av him all further trouble. Though the Garfield monument fair was not financially a success it developed a num ber of amusing incidents. One was the developu ent of Congressman Ilouck. of Tennessee, and one Wigsrins, of : some where, as presidential candidates.. A gold watch was voted the most popular candi date, and k spite of the fact that votes were cast for more -than twenty-five candi dates, among whom were such well-known names as James , U. , Blaine, bamuel J Tilden and Dr. Mary E. Walker, the friends of Houck and5 Wiggins fairly astonished themselves by the strength they were found to possess. , iiut ilouck car ried off the election. All the goasipers, have been indulging in more or less talk about the coming social season at the capital, which they generally predict is to be unusually lively. The season will be short,, and , we shall have here an unusual number r of people who come just to spend the winter and see what is going on. This class is growing yearly, and the peculiarities of the present situation adds to their number a good many who are interested in political mat tersthe cac vass for the next speakership. the revision of the tariff and other kindred subjects. The President will take a hand in the social festivities this season, which will be opened with the New Year's recep tion at the White House. Having a good deal of pride about doing such things cor rectly and. brilliantly, it is probable that the rounds of receptions and dinners will be in keeping with the predictions and expecta tioos ror an unusually brilliant season. Last winter, while the President was writ ing ' his CQBimumcations to congress and his . notes . to personal friends on paper deeply bordered with , mourning,, it was proper that a degree of restraint should be observed at the executive mansion. The season of official mourning was long xgo ended, and the occasion for it has faded from the memory o." most people here. In preparation for the fitting reception of guests at the, vt bite House, the interior. as well as the exterior, has been improved The scaffoldings are still up in the halls and the vestibule, but the work of the dec orators will be completed in a lew days. Don Pedro 'Merrimac" in March. 1862, In the course of discussion Mr. Bayne, of Pennsylvania, called attention to the fact that yesterday ! tae house voted down a measure for the benefit of the soldier wha- were n poor- houses, and now all at once a great oppo nent of all impoverished soldiers, (alluding to Mr. Hewitt, of. New York) rose ? and described a conference which he once at- i tended, and how he and that conference' had saved the spoliation of New York city, and told how be wanted to appropri ate 1200.000 to a few men who had taken part in the combat with the Merrimac. If these people were poor let New York take i care of them. The enacting clause of the bill was then struck out on a motion by Mr. Atherton, of Ohio 102 to 84. The committee then rose, but no action on its report was taken by the house. Mr. Bingaam, of Pennsylvania, reported a bill reducing postage to two cents. Re-1 ferred. Adjourned TEN
