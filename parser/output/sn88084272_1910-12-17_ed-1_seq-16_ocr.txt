Washington, D. C, Dec 17. A par cels post will be one of the most im portant subjects that the present con gress will have to deal with, and the champions of this movement feel con fident that some definite steps will be talcen toward the establishment of i this system before congress adjourns j The fact 'that both president Taft, in his annual message, and postmaster general Hitchcock in his annual re port, have recommended the rural par cels post, has greatlv strengthened their hopes, and the3' believe that if once a sj'stem is established for the rural districts, it will only be a short time before It is made general.. James L. Cowles, founder and secre tary of the Postal Progress league, says that a vigorous campaign will be made this year in Washington to bring about tne enactment of some parcels post j iegi5ia.i.ion. "Should we fail." he continued, "we shall urge the president to call a special session of the sixty-second congress to take up this matter. "Every effort is being 'made bv the i members of our league throughout the I country to bring about the efection of senators pledged to a parcels post sys tem.

It provides that all mail matter col lected and delivered within the differ ent rural routes of the United States j shall be in one class, with rates, door j-o uour, Deiween tne airterent nouses and places of business, and the post office or postoffices on each route, as follows: On parcels up to one twenty inches in dimensions and up to one pound in weight, 1 cent; on larger parcels up to one-half a cubic foot or six by 12 by 12 inches in dimensions and up to 11 counds In weight, 5 cents; on larger, parcels up to one cubic foot, six by 12 by 24 Inches in dimensions and up to 25 pounds in weight, 10 cents.

Is Xot Taft's Plan. 'f ourse'this is not in accordance with the recommendation of the presi- dent' aihe gests only a parcel? post for rural sections, while Sulzer's bill provides for a general system. Some parcels post enthusiasts oppose even the Sulzer bill on the ground that f the merchandise rate should only be a cent a pound. This they claim, is the only way that uncle Sam can hope to compete with the express companies. They argue that if the bill is made a law as it stands, uncle Sam will get all the long hauls, where losses are In curred, while the express companies .m t -, ,. - i. r.

The resolution declared that under existing laws, the government has a monopoly for carrying all letters and packages. The law specifically dei-f clares for "letters and packets." According to Mr. Murdock "packets" cover most of the packages handled bj' the express companies, although the postoffice officials construe it to mean "packets of letters," in accordance with an opinion given by attorney general MacVeagh in 1881. Mr. Murdock declared that the Mac Veagh opinion was not founded on law or fact. Nothing definite came of tae resolu tion, but the master will be taken up in the near future, and every effort will be made to have congress look into It. Beach Is Pleased. Frederick O. Beach, editor of the Scientific American and president of the Postal Progress league, seems greatly pleased with the progress that Is being made. I "Parcels post legislation is bound to come soon," ihe said in an interview with a representative of the Interna tional News Service. "All the leading nations in tne wona nave it, and it has proved not only a great time and' money saver to the merchants, but is .i- .- -" . also a great source of revenue to the goverament. In Germany the government will carry packages up to 110 pounds for one-third of a cent a pound, while under our present laws, the govern ment charges the prohibitive rate of 16 cents a pound for merchandise, and refuses to take anything over four pounds. Think of our rural free de livery being run at a loss of millions of ( dollars a year. The driver makes his daily rounds with his horse and wagon, and a load of mail weighing about 25 pounds, while there is room for at least 500 pounds. This space J could be filled -with packages sent by Parcels post. Not only would this sys- I tem be of immense benefit to the farm- I ers, but the income derived from it would overcome the postal deficit. "Of course, legislation of this kind j would decrease the swollen profits of the express companies, but the people are arousd and it is bound to come.

Republican Growth Heaviest in Congressional Districts - to Be Divided. ! FOUR NEW ME'MBERS IN TEXAS POSSIBLE Austin, Texas, Dec. 17, The reappor tionment of the congressional and other political divisions of the state, on the basis- of the new population figures, must be made by the next legislature, which is to convene in January, and, while it is stated that this work could be performed at a special session, it is considered unlikely that there will be any postponement of the task. It is considered not at all unlikely that in counties where there may be plain evi dence that an incomplete count of the people was made a recount may be or dered. ' Democratic Politicians Disappointed. The men most keenly disappointed over the federal census figures for Tex as are .the Democratic politicians who aspire to being elected to congress by the creation of new districts and the general readjustment of the present ones. In the absence of the establish ment of the new basis of population for congressional districts it is not defi nitely known how many additional con gressmen the census figures will give I Texas. It is considered practically as sured that it will not be less than two and it may be as many at four. The more new districts that are allowed the state the greater will be the legislative wirepulling for their creation on the part of aspiring politicians. Sixteenth DLstrlct'w Growth. By far the greatest proportion or percentage of population increase dur ing the last 10 years was in the west ern and southern parts of the state. The most wonderful showing in tHis partic ular is In the Sixteenth congressional district, represented .by W. R. Smith. The area of this district is S3.2S6 miles, embracing 56 counties, some of which are as large as the average state. It is more than five hundred miles across this district at its widest point, east j and. west. In 1900 it had a population of 161,084. The census figures recently announced give the district a popula- t tion of 367,623, which is an increase of 206,39 in 10 years. Thirteenth Comes Xext. V Immediately north of this district is the Thirteenth district, embracing the Panhandle region. It is represented in congress by John H. Stephens. This district hal; an area of 44,607 square miles and in 1900 its population was 188,541. The new census gives the dis trict a population of 338,333, an increase of 149,792. The LKJsyer Rio Grande. The lower Rio Grande border region which is embraced In the Fifteenth district, has Increased in population from 166,694 in 1900, to 235,895 in 1910. These 69,201 new people have gone into that territory within, the last four or five years, the new e;ra of settlement j The (Copyright,

The Fifteenth district has . an area of 35,525 miles, and is repre- : sented In congress by John N. Garner. I The district was cut out in the shape of j a shoestring by the legislature in or der to prevent the several Republican ' counties along the border and towards j the interior from wielding political con- j trol. j Growth of Fourteenth. ! The district in which San Antonio is situated, the Fourteenth, made large ) gain in population during the last 10 j years. The census of 1900 gave that j district a population of 181,250. The j new census shows that the aggregate ; population of the counties composing j the district ist 269,198. an increase of j 87,948. James L-. Slayden has represent- ed this district in congress for several j 3'ears. Dallas Helps Fifth Grow. The rapid growth of Dallas accounts; chiefly for the increase in the aggre- J gate population of the counties com- J posing the Fifth district. The popula tion of this district in 1900 was 200,061, and in 1910. 293,654. Jack Beall is the present congressman from this district. Two Show Decrease. The new census shows a falling off in the popuation of the Third and Fourth districts. The former decreased from 191,953 to 186,854, and the latter from 218,963 to 214,721, Both of these dis tricts are situated in North Texas. An analysis of the population figures by districts shows that the reapportion ment will chiefly concern, the western and southern portions of the state. The gain of population in the remainder of the state, exclusive of the Third and Fourth districts, which show decreases, was relatively smalL Readjustment of Boundaries. It is expected that there will be a general readjustment of the boundary lines of all the districts. This will be absolutely necessary as to most of the t districts where the increase of popula- j tion was even slight, if the change in the basis of representation is made by congress, which now seems to be assured. But it Is in carving out the new districts from the big scope of ter- ' ritory Into which new settlers are now pouring that promises to excite the , more intense rivalry on the part of j congressional aspirants. It is already apparent that the present Texas deleea- F tion in congress will strive to keep their respective districts as intact as possible, but to what extent the legis lature will respect the wishes of these officeholders remains to be seen. May Give Republicans Chance. It is in the -western and southern por tions of the state that the Republican vote is the largest. With the influx: of new settlers from northern and middle western states into these parts" during the last few years the Republican vot ing strength has been greatly increased. It took some radical gerrymandlng on the part of the legislature 10 years ago to create districts in the San Antonio and Rio Grande border territory that A would be assuredly Democratic The coming legislature has- a still harder task before it of grouping the counties so- as to make the new districts in that part of the state Democratic The Republican voting strength, in all of the larger cities of the state is much, larger than in the smaller towns and rural sections. For this reason no Democratic congressional possibility who lives outside of these cities wants one of them in his district. San Anto nio was formerly in one of the Rio Grande border districts, but at ,the last apportionment, through the persistent effort of Mr. Garner and other rural members of the legislature from that part of the state, it was shunted out of Its natural tributary territory and placed in a shoestring district that ex tends north for two hundred miles.
