President's Message Fellow- Citizen* of the Senate and Home of Representative*: In the midst of unprecedented political trouble*, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests. You will not be turprised to learn that In the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended wltb profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people hare, duriog the whole year, been engaged in au attempt,to divide nud destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious and domestic divisions, is exposed to dis respect abroad, and one party, or both is ?ure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign in terruption. K Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seem ing expediency and .ungenerous ambitious, although measures adopted under such in fluences seldom fail.to be unfortunate and uninjurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in re ward for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they expected. If it were just to suppose as the insur gents have seemed to assume that foreign nations in this case disregarded all moral, aocial and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy res toration of commerce, including specially the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear yet not to have seen their way to tbis.object more directly or clearly through the destruction than tbroughjthe preserva tion of the Union. If we could daro to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principles than this, I am quite sure a second argument could be toade to show-them that they could ranch their aim more.readily and easily, by aid ing to orush this rebellion, than by giving encouragement to the principal lever re lied on by the exciting of foreign nations to hostility against us as already intimated iTi emharraasment of commerce. Thoae nation., however, not improbably "W [">?? the lhat it ... the 0oioJ which made as well our foreign as our do mestic commerce. They can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion pro duoes the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive, valuable and relia ble commerce than can ibe name nation broken into hostile fragments. Il ia not my purpose to reriow ourdijeus sioos Will] foreign States, became what ever might be their wishes or depositions, the Integrity of our country and the stabil ity,ofourgorernment depend tnatolj not up on them, bnl upon the loyally, patriotism, virtue and Intelligence of the American people. The.., correspondence itself, with the usual rtservXtions, is herewith subtn - ted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers, averting ciuses of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our own rights add honor. . Since, howover, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers -necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample meas ures be adopted for maintaining the public ,defences on every side. While under this general recommendation, provision for de rending onr coast line re.dily occurs to the mind. I also, in the same connection, Ukei and"iMr?n ?f Coagnu 10 onr treat It Is believed that some fortifications and depots of srrfiB and monitions, with Harbor and navigation improvements at Well selected points upon these, would be of great importance to thenaUnnal defense Cud preservation. I ask attention to the leers of the Secretary of War, expressed to his report upon the same general sub ject. rl deem It of importance that the Inyal ,F"\T,,nn",ce ttnd Western ir. !l! t j* *^on,d be connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts or the Union by railroad. Itherefore recommend, J}.' measure, that Congress pro Tide for the construction of .och a road a. jwit M possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-opente, and through her Luis. ??* most Judicious selection of The Northern terminus must conned With some existing railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or NlcbolrsviUe to Cumberland Gap, or Trom Lebanon to the Tennessee line In the d|. rectlon of Knoxvllle, or come other still distant line can easily be determined. Kentucky ud the Qsnemi Government so-opiratlng the work can be completed Itt a very short urns and when done ft jrM sot only be of rut present nisfulness bat 41so an available permanent improvement worth its cost in all the futdre. Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been ne gotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration. Although we have failed to indnce some of the com mercial powers to adopt a desirable me lioration for the rigor or maritime war, we have far removed all the obstables from the waj of their humane reform, except Bueh as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence. I invite your attention to the correspon dence between Her Britanic Majesty's min ister accredited to this government and the Secretary of State, relative to the deten tion of the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by the U. S. steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and as justice requires that we should commi no belligerent act not founded in strict right, as sanctioned by public law, I re commend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention. I repeat the recommendation of my pre decessor in his annual message to Con gress iii December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will prob ably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the Commissioners under the act of the 3d of March, 1861. If, however, it should not be deemed ad visable to carry that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given (or investing the principal of over the surplus referred to in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of snch other just claims of onr citizens against China, as are not unlikely to arise here after, in the course of our extensive trade with that Empire. By the act of the 6th of August last Congress authorized the President to in struct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to cap ture pirates. Tbis authority has been ex ercised in a single instance only. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be ndvisable to authorise the commanders of sailing vessels to re-cap ture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the consular courts established by law in eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be object ed to by the loyal authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withdrawing our re cognition of the independence and sover eignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to in augurate a novel policy in regard to them, without the approbation of Cougress, I I submit for your consideration the expe diency of an appropriation for maintain ing a "Charge 0'Affairs near cach of those States. It does not admit of doubt that important eommercial advantages might be pecurcd by favorabls treaties with tliem. The op erations of the treaty during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment, bave been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the people has placed at the disposal of the governmeht the large tneuii!* demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the National loan has been ta ken by the citizens of the industrial class es whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal for their countrys deliverance from its present peril, have induced tbein to contribute to the support of the govern ment, the whole of their acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action. The revenue from all sources, in cluding loans, for the financial year ending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,835, 900 24, and the expenditures for the same period, including pay men ta on accouut of the public debt, were ?84,578,034,34, leav ing.a balance in the treasury on the 1st of July of $2,257,065,80. For the first quarter of the financial year ending 30th of September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance from Joly 1st, were $102,232,500,27, and the expenses $08,239,732,09, leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of $4,292,776,18. Estimates for the remaining three quar ters of the year and for the financial year of 1863, together with his views of the ways and means for meeting the demands cobteuipfated by him will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know the expenses made necessary bv the rebellion, are not beyond the resources of the loyal people and we believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it until peace and union shall again bleas the land. 1 respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information respect ing the numerical strength of the Army and for recommendations having in view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of the ser vice entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the public fa equal to the occasion and thnt the num ber of troops tendered greatly oxceeds the rorce which Congress authorised mo to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to these portions of his report which make allusion to the cred itable degree of discipline already attain ed by our troops, and to the excellent san itary condition of the entire army. The recommendation by the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis, is an object of vital importance to the future safety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Con gress. A large addition to the regular army in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of Cadeta to the greatest extent of_the Military Academy. By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to pfovide chaplains for the hos pitals occupied by volunteers. This sub ject was brought to my notice, and I waa induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which was properly addressed to each Of the persons and at the dates respectively named and stated in a sched ule, containing also the forin of the letter marked "A," and herewith transmitted. These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the dutiea at the time respectively designated in the schedule, and bave la bored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore recommend that they be compen sated at the same rate as Chaplains in tho army. I further suggest that general pro visions be made for Chaplains to serve at hospitals,.as well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents In detail the operations of that branch of the service, and the activity and energy which have characterised Its ad ministration and the results of measores.to increase Its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions by construction and purchase that It may almost be said a Navy has been created and brought into service since onr difficulties commenced. Besides blockading onr intensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before assem bled under onr flag bave been pat afloat and performed deeds which have Increased our naval renown. .

I ask attention to the Report of the PostMaster General, the following be ing a summary statement of the condition of the Department. The revenue from all sources during the fiscal year ending 30th June 1861 including the annual permanent appropriation of $700,000 for the trans pirtation of free mail matter, was $9,049, 296,40, being about two per cent less than the revenue of 1860. Tbo expenditures wero $13,606,709,11, showing a decrease of more than e'ght per cent, as compared with those of the p recced log year and leav ing an excess of expenditures over the rev J enne for the last fiscal year of over $557, ! 462,71. j I The gross revenue for the year ending June 30th, 1863, is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent, on that of 1861, making .$8,683,000 to which should be added the earnings of the department for carrying fret* matter, viz; $700,000, making $9,832,* 000. ? The total expenditures for 1863 are es timated at $12,528,000, leaving an esti mated deficiency of $3,345,000 to be sup plied from the Treasury, in addition to the permanent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, thut the extension ot this District acrors the Potomac river at the time of estab lishing the Capital here, was eminently wise, and consequently that the relinquish ment of that portion of it which lies in the State of Vit^inia, was unwise and ? dangerous. I s?bmit for your "onsideration, the ex pediency of regaining that part of the Dis trict of Columbia and the restoration of the original boundaries thereof, through 'negotiations with the state of Virginia. The report of the Secretary of the Inte rior, with the accompanying documents, ex hibit the condition of the several branches of the public business, pertaining to that depni tment. The depressing influences of the insurrection have been especially felt in the operations of the Patent and Gener al Land Office. The cash receipts from the sales of pub lic lands during the last year have exceed ed the expenses of our land Bystem onlj about $200,000. The sales have been en tirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the North west ? The receipts of the patent office have declined in nine months, about $100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force , employed neees?ary to make it self sustai j utng. The demand upon tbo pension office j will belargely increase by the insurrection. ! Numerous applications for pensions,based j upon the casualties of the existing war I have already been made. ! There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension roli and in re ceipt of the bounty of the government, are ill the ranks.of the insurgent array or giv ing aid and comfort. The Secretary of the ! Interior has directed the suspension of the payment of the pension of such persons upon proof of their disloyalty, t I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension ro,,s- ~ The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes- have been lately dis turbed by the Insurrection?especially in the Northern Superintendency and in that : of New Mexico. IThe Indian coubtry south of Kansas is In possession of tho iusurgeota from Texas and Arkansas. . The agents of the United States appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendency huve been unable to reach their posts, while the tnost of those who were in offico before that time have espoused the insnrrectionnry cause, and armed to oxercise tho power of agents by viitue of missions from the insur gents. It has been stated in the public press, that a portion of these Iudians huvo been organized as a military forco and are at . tached to the army of the insurgents; al though the government has no official in formation upon the subject. Letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indi an Affairs by several prominent Chiefs gi ving assurance of their loyalty to tbo Uni ted States, and expressing the wish for the ?? presence of the Federal troops to protCCt ? them. It is believed that on the re-possession of the country by tho Federal forces the Indians will readily cease the hostile dem onstrations and resume their former rela tions to the Government. Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the na ! tion, baa not a department or a bureau, but a clerkship assigned to it in the Gov ernment While it is fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its na ture as not to have demanded and rceeivedinore from the Government. I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advantage. An nual reports exhibiting the condition of our agricultural commerce and manufactures, would present a fund of information of ; great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion as to de tails, I venture the opinion that an agri cultural and. statistical bureau might pro fitably be organized. The execution of the laws for tho sup pression of the African slave trade has been confined to tbe Department of the Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that j tho offorta which hnvo been mado for tho suppression of this inhnman traffic have | recently been attended with unusal suc ?ceas. PiTe vessels being fitted out for j the slave trade have been seised and con : demned. Two masters engaged in the trade and one person equipping the ves sel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of a fine and im prisonment, and one captain taking out a cargo of Africans on board his vessel has been convicted of the highest grade of ofienco under our laws the punishment of whfeh is death. The territories of Colorado, Dekotah and Nevada, created by the last Congress have been, organised and civil administra tion has been inaugurated therein, under auspices especially gratifying, when It is considered that tuc leaven of treason was found existing In some of these new conn tries when th? federal officers arrived there. The abundant natural resources of these territories, with the security and protec tion afforded by organised government, will doubtless Invite to them a large im migration when peace shall restore the bu siness of the country to Its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the legislature of Colorado, which evince the patriotic spirit of the people of the terrl % far the authority of tbe U. S. Gov ernment bsi been upheld in all the terri tories, as it Is hopod it will be In the fu ture. ! commend their Interest# an* dn ' fense to the enlightened and generous caro of Congress. I recommend toHthe favora ble consideration of Congress the interests of the District of Columbia. Tbe insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to tbe inhab itants, and as they hare no representative in Congress, thai body should not over look their just claims upon the Govern ment. At your late session, a joint resolution was adopted, authorising the President to take measures for facilitating a proper lep resentation of the industrial interests of tbe United States at the Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations, to be holdeu at Londonjin the year.1862. I regret not tb hnve been unable to give personal atten tion to this subject?a subject at once so interesting in itself, and so extensively and intricately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretary of State a plan and system has been devised, and partly matured, which will be laid before you. Under and by virtue of the act of Con gress, entitled, "An act to confiscate pro perty used for insurrectionary purposes," approved August 6th, 1861, legal claims of certain persons to the lahor and service of certain other persons have become for feited, and numbers of the latter thus lib erated are already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for tn some way besides this. It is not impossible that some of tbe States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by the operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for dispos al. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from such states according to some mode ot val uation in lieu pro tanto of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such states respectively, that such persons in such acceptance by the general govern ment be at once deemed free, and that in any event steps be taken for colonization with clrtBsea or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into expedi ence in some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the Uni- j ted States could not so far as individuals j may desire be included in such coloniza- ; tion. To carry ont the plan of coloniza- ? tion may involve the acquiring of territory and also tbe appropriation of money be yond that to bo expended iu tbe territorial *X:!Tp'"C?c*d the .cquUUio^or^er c o n sti^^ ' p o w e?r?w aa ?ffrs t ^e?ffor wtit'e me""thiay measnro effects ??^ssas2?'S& "1?"

Since jroar l&tt adjournment Lieut, j Geo. Scott has retired from the head of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit, yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country'from :i time far back in our history, when few of the now living had been born, and thence forward continually. I cannot but think that we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for your considera tion what further mark of recognition is due to him and yourselves as a grateful people. With the retirement of General Scott came the executive duty of appoint ing in his stead a General-in-Chief ot the ?*rmy. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither In council nor country was there, so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected.? The retiring Chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of Gen. McClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence The designation of Gen. McClellan is, therefore, in a considerable degree, the se lection^ of the country, as well as of the bxecutive. and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him the con iidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised, and without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country. It has been said that one bad General is better than two good ones, and that saying is true if taken to mean no more than that au army is better directed by a jingle man, though! nferior, than by two snperior ones at variance and cross-purpose*, and the same Is true in all joint operations wherein tho*e engaged can have none but a common end in view and can dif fer only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea, no one on board can wish the ship to sink, and yet not {infrequently all go down together, becouse too many will direct and no sin gle mind can be allowed to control. It continues to develope that the insur rection is largely, if not extensively a war upon the first principle of popular govern ment?the rights of the people. Conclu sive evidence of this is found in the most grave nnd maturely considered public doc uments, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In these documents we find the abridge ment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the people of all right to par ticipate in the select on of publiv officers, except the legislative body, advocated with labored argument to prove that large con trol of the government in the people is the source of all political evil. Monarchy it self is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.? In my present position I could scarcely be justifiable were I to omit raising a warn ing voice against this approach of return ing despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point with its connections not so hackneyed as most others to which I ask a brief uttention?it is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above labor in the structure of the govern ment; It is assumed that labor Is available only in connection with capital, that no body labors unless somobody else owning capital somehow by the use of it induces him to labor This assumed, it is next, considered whether it is best that capital sh'ill bire laborers nnd induce them to work by their own consent, or bur them and drive them to it without their consent. Having pro ceeded so far. it is naturally cohludei that all laborers are either hired iaiborers or what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired la borer, is fixed in the condition for lite. Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor Is there any such thing ?? a freeman being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these assumptions are false and all inferences from them are groundless. Labor Is prior to and independent of capi tal. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed If labor had not first existed. Labor is the supeiior of capital and deserves much the higher con sideration. Capital has its rights, whiph are as wor thy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is and probably al ways will be a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a cammunity exists witbin that relation. A few men own capital, nnd that few avoid labor, and with their capital hire or buy a few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class?neither work for others nor have others work for them. In most of the Southern States a ma jority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majorityare neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families, wives, sons and daughters work for themselves on their farms, in their houses and in their shops, taking the whole prodoct to them selves, and asking no favors of capital on the one band, nor of hired labor or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their'o'wn labor with capital, that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them. But this is only a mixed and hot a distinct class. No priuciple stated is disturbed by the ex istence of this mixed class. Again, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed for that con dition for life. Many independent men, everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beggar in the world, labors for wages awhile, and saves a sur plus with which to buy tools or land for himself, tben labors on bis own account, and at length hires another new begin ear to work Tor him. This Is the just and a generous and a prosperous ayseem, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all and consequent energy, progress and improvement of the condition to nil. No men living are mure worthy to be trusted than those who toil up or on from poverty?none less inclioed to take or touch onght which they have not honestly earbed. Let them be aftrare of surrounding a por litical power which they already possess nnd which If surrendered will be surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix newe disa bilities nnd pardens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost. Prom the first taking of our national census to the last ere 70 years, nnd we find our population at the end of that period 6 tlmei as great as it was at the beginning. The increase of thole other things which men deem duirable has been even greater. We thus have, at ono view, what the popular principle applied to gevornmant through the machinery of the States and the Union has produced in a given time, and aUo what, if flrmljr maintained.

FROM SKCE881A. a ? ? In Eut Tennessee. A prominent citizen of oar neigh boring town of Martinsville, O., sends os the fol. 1 lowing letter, accompanied by the subjoin ed note: The following letter, which I hate beeu permitted to copy for publication, win speak for itself. 1 am acquainted with the writer?a young man of 19 years, resident of onr village, has been absent since De cember last, and I can vouch for its genu, ineness. Anjr one doubting the same can see the original by calling on the young * man's mother, Mrs. Kate Lewis, of thia place. The letter is written at Calloway Post Office, Harlan county, Ky., close to the | East Teouessee liae, aud is as follows: Dear Mother:?I suppose you have aft given me op for dead, but, thank God, I am still alt re, and may some day get back to see my dear mother, sisters and brothers. I hare been in the rebel army for three or four months. Was caught and threatened to be banged if I did not enlist. I enlisted, trusting to lock to get away, having one of the most infamons oaths forced npon at that was ever taken by man. I'll commence and give you the full details us far as I au> on paper. The day after I received your last letter, a young man, post-master of that place, (Tlgeraville, La.,) came to me. He had beard some men say they were going to arrest me for being an abolitionist, because 1 was from a Northern State; be told me to to try and get away. I mailed a letter to you with $30 in it, then went and hid In a wood-house until dark. When the cars came I went to the town I spoke of in one of my letters, (Brashear City.) When I got there, there was no way of getting away without going back through the town I bad left. So fearing'to go back, 1 took passage on the steamer Matagorda for Galveston.? f Woen 1 got to Texas, they were takiog op Union men and hanging tbem like dogs. I got me an old suit of elothes, and hired mjaelf out to work on the H. T. &. B. R. IL, until I could get a chance to get away.? That was i? the month of March. I work ed there about three weeks, when, in com pany with a yonng man from Ohio, I started to walk to Red River, all eommunieation by sea being cut off. It was a dangerous project, but better than staying and being forced into the rebel army. We bad got within 50 miles of Alexandria, on the riv er. when we were stopped by a band of vil lians and forced to join a company of vol' ante era, in a small town called Cheney - villa; Rapids Parish, La. W? were kept there three weeks, when we were taken to New Orleans nnd mastered into the State service of Louisiana. We were then taken up to a town called Tanghipbis, went into camp, were drilled for near three months, then mustered into the Confederate ser vice and started for the seat of war with the 8th Regiment La. rebels, on the last Monday in June. Wednesday morning af ter we started through Hnntsville Alabama where Miss E. P. was, I kept awake all night, hoping the cars wonld stop long enough for me to find oat if she was still there, aad have her let you know where I was, for I coald not send a letter without letting our officers read it. Bnt the cars stopped only a few minutes, so I had to go without seeing her. We traveled night and day until Friday morning at 1 o'clock, only stopping for wood and water, and then a heavy gaard around the train to keeo the men from running off. On that morning I .pretended I had the diarroeha and got out. My frisnd crawled from nnder the cars and we took to the woods and made our way towards Ky.? The town where we left the train is Bris tol, Sullivan county Tenn.) We traveled until a little before day, when we hid our selves. At 11 o'clock we started again and ran right into a town called Blountville before we knew it. We both had military clothes on, and were surrounded by a band of rebels and earnc near being taken, but we talked fhem T>ct of it, told them we were absent on furlough and were go ing back in a week. We left them talking about taking us np as deserters. So soon as we were fairly out of sight, we changed oar course and traveled a different direc tion until we were out of their reach. We Iben traveled abont seventy six miles wwt ioto Sand villa, Hancock county. There are lota of good men tbere, who would not let us leave tbem to go into Ry., as there were rebel soldiers guarding almost every road, and sconts scouting the woods and bills to keep some of the leading Union men from going into Ky., to let the U. S. Government know that there were men in Tenn., ready, willing aud anxious to fight for their connrry, and their country's laws. So it was a great risk, if not an almost impossibility to cross the mountains. The rebels soon found ont that we were in the country and formed companies to take us, when they were met by a company of Union men and driven back. Wo stayed there until last Thurs day, when ten mounted men started after me, (my companion having started to Ken tucky the day before-) They came up Clinch river, took a young man prisoner by the name of B ana tried to make htm tell where I was. He refused, and broke from them in a corn field. They then abated B 's wife, and Mrs. L- - threatening to barn their bouses if they did not bring me out. Finally concluding I was not there, they started back, when they were fired upon by four of my friends, shooting one through the bat, raising the hide on the top of bxs head, wounding another and killing a I left Kentucky the next day. a Metho dist minister, I had been staying ^ thinking it the best I could do.
