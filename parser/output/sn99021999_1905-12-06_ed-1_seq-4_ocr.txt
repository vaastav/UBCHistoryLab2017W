I A gout heart ban txen presented to President Roosevelt by Colorado admlr - era, which proves once more that the whirligig of time has its revengvs. Only a few years ago any man from Colorado who would bate dared to Introduce any nhlng ms.de of gold into the White pSouse w.ould hsve made the .acquaint anew of the Tlgllantes. the rnrsfOKATS msssaqk. President Roosevelt's annual message deals comprehensively and forcefully with the subjects that are uppermost In the public thought and Interest. Giv ing first place to the question of the supervision and regulation by the na tlonal 'government of corporations en gaged iu Intei-state commerce, the pres ident points out that the policy he urges has become a necessity by reason of the great fortuues amassed through cor porate organisation and the power vested in those who wield these for tunes. He recognizes that this is an' age of combination and that any effort to prevent all combination would be both useless and vicious, but they must be subject to some sovereign authority and control and this can be exercised only by tho general government, repre senting the whole people. "Our steady aim shoald bo.py legislation, cautiously aHd carefully undertaken, ' but reso lutely persevered in, to assert the sov ereignty of the national government by affirmative action." The president Cites overcapitalization as bne of the abuses to. be prevented, saying that generally this Is itself the result of dishonest pro motion. He believes that congress possesses authority to provide for. the desired supervision and regulation, but If not authority must be given it through amendment of the constitution. In regard to railway rate regulation, the president renews the recommenda tion of his message of last year with some slight modification which in no wise impairs .or weakens the position he then declared. He urged a year ngo that a rate fixed by the commission should go iuto immediate effect and stay in effect unless and until the court of review .reverses .it. v His present sug gestlon-ls that when -a maximum roa sonable rate Is prescribed by the com mission or other administrative Wy it shall go into effect within a reasonable time and obtain from thence onward. subject to review by the courts. While this is in the nature of a compromise It is very far from being a relinquish ment ou the part of the president of the vital principle for which he contends namely, that , an administrative body created by congress, must be given the power, when a railway rate has upon complaint and after investigation lcen adjudged to be unreasonable, shall de clare a reasonable rate, subject to re vision by the courts. The bill framed by the Interstate Commerce commission, and which Is understood to be In a gen eral way opproved by the president, pro vides that the orders of the commission shall be effective within thirty days from the time they are made, subject to Judicial review upon proceedings taken within sixty' days. Assuming this measure, in drafting which It is said Attorney General Moody and Sec retary Taft were consulted, to repre sent the president's views, thirty days is regarded as a reasonable time within which the orders of the commission' or other administrative body should take effect. The president is careful to have It tinderstood that he does not propose to give the commission power to initiate or originate rates generally, "but to regulate a rate already fixed or orig inated by the roads, upon complaint and after investigation." The policy urged does not contemplate a sweep ing and arbitrary regulation of rates, but simply the correction of those that are found to be unreasonable. It would seem that no railroad disposed to deal fairly and Justly with the public could object to this. A very Important sug gestion in the message is that there should be publicity of the accounts of common carriers, that all books or mem oranda of the common carriers should be open to the Inspection of the govern ment, for "only In this way can viola tions or evasions of the law be surely detected." Of ourse the railroads will vigorously fight this proposition which it may be remarked is embraced in the bill framed by the commission but the soundness of It is unquestionable. On the question of national regula tion of insurance companies, the presi dent points out its great importance, whtch has been emphasized by recent events. This matter will come before congress during the session and doubt less will be thoroughly discussed. The president is strongly of the opinion that there should be national supervision of the Insurance business and In this be has the support of a very large part of the public and practically the entire body of policyholders. The relations of capital and labor re ceive attention in the message and the well known views 'of Mr. Roosevelt repeatedly avowed, are again stated. The cardinal principle is thus declared "Individual capitalist and individual wage worker, corporation and union, are alike entitled to the protection of the law and must alike obey the law." What the president says on this sub ject merits thecareful attention f both employers anu employed, as to reve nues the president Is clearly not in favor of any present readjustment of the tariff, on the ground that It is not now needed. He urges, however", that unless expenditures can be kept within the revenues the reveuue laws must be readjusted. He therefore recommends rigid scrutiny of appropriations. The president thinks the currency should have greater elasticity, but does not ap pear to regard the matter as ot urgent importance. a The view respecting the nary is some thing of a surprise, since it does not recommend any considerable addltlou to the present sea power. The standard of efficiency that has been reached should be maintained, but it is thought to be unnecessary that iu the immediate future the navy should be increased be yond the present number of units. As congress will undoubtedly be found to .concur in this opinion it la safe to pre. diet a large reduction In naval appropri ations. In reference to Immigration the message Is in harmony with Intelligent "and unprejndlced public sentiment The president believes we should deal fairly and Justly towsrd the Chinese. "We cannot ask the Chinese to do to us what we are unwilling to do to them." The message Is throughout Interesting and Instructive and no one who would be Informed regarding public affairs, and particularly those questions which are of most commanding Importance, should fall to carefully read it. THC 

TBV8T ISVKSTIQATIOKS: It is expected that at an early day Commissioner Garfield will have com pleted his report on the Investigations of a number of the big trusts which have been made by the bureau of cor porations. It is said the report will re veal the fact that the agents of the bureau have been carrying on an In quiry Into the methods of the Coal trust and the Lumber trust, the results of which, along with those concerning the other examinations, will be sent to congress for such legislation as may be considered necessary. The findings in all of the inquiries will of course go to the president in whose discretion It is to say whether or not they shall be made public. Doubtless congress will ask the president for such luformatiou obtained by the Investigations as he may see fit to communicate and it is to be presumed that he will thus give publicity to at least a part of the information secured. The bureau of corporations, it ap pears, has been most industriously en gaged In these investigations, which have embraced the Oil, Sugar, Steel, Tobacco, Beef, Lumber and Coal trusts. How thorough the Inquiries have been cannot be known until the rejtort is completed, but It Is not to be doubted that a great deal of hard and earnest work has been done by Commissioner Garfield nnd those under him. It is said that the big corporations or so- called trusts have come to the conclu alon that it Is idle for them to oppose the efforts of the government to get cer tain information about their operations and as a result they no longer attempt to hinder the agents of the government This shows that very substantial prog ress has been made in bringing the big corporations to a realisation of their amenability to the law. soma rut timk. The proper time for the banishment of the liquor traffic from the proscribed district is at the end of the year when the application of saloon keepers located In that section of the city are before the police board for new licenses. If the police board refuses the applications the saloons will be compelled to close down for good and no serious hardship will be inflicted on them or the brewers. If, on the other hand, their licenses are ex tended for another year, ' their resorts cannot be closed except upon individual complaints against each for law viola tion, which would Involve a great deal of disagreeable contention, that should be avoided and forestalled by the action of the police board. The assertion of a member of the board that the maintenance of the sa loons located In the proscribed district under rigid police surveillance would be much better for good government than their banishment, is illogical and lrra tlonal. In the first place, the saloons In the proscribed district could not exist profit ably to their keepers unless they are kept open In violation of lawN Their heavy traffic is after midnight all the year around and, therefore, in conflict with the statutes and municipal ordl nances. In the next place, there is ho rigid po lice surveillance over the saloons in the district and there never will be so long as the present policy Is pursued. On the contrary, these saloons have always been and are now patronized at all hours of the night by the vicious and criminal classes and if any police surveillance is exercised it Is not visible to those who have taken the trouble to investigate existing conditions. The rantankerous Cathers has hereto fore Invoked the power of the courts to restrain the unlawful expenditure of municipal funds and prevent overlaps, but now he has Invoked the power of injunction to restrain the lty from sav ing money by the consolidation of the city and county treasurer's offices. As there has always been method In Catb ers' madness, bis latest appeal to the courts is evidently made for some client or clients who are not taxpayers and have no standing In court The query naturally suggests Itself, What ple-blter does Cathers represent? The city legal department announces that It will co-operate with the attorney general in fighting the Injunctions brought by the Union Pacific and Bur llngton to prevent the collection of taxes levied against their property. If the city authorities want to go the limit they should issue a proclamation and abide by it, that no railroad receive any more concessions from the city tn the way of vacating streets or permitting trackage in alleys until all taxes are paid to date. The school board has adopted a resold tlon requiring the members to put In their whole time during school board meetings upon board business. The members of the School board might also with propriety have resoluted to double their own salaries in view of the in creased work. The efforts of Senators Millard and Burkett to have Omaha made ueadquar ters for a live stock inspection division covering the territory between the Mis aourt river and the Rockies should be backed up by all our local commercial organizations. The more government work is centered in Omaha the more Im portant will the city become for the peo- le of nrroundlng territory. The self-constituted watch dog of the treasury now objects to the consolida tion of city and county treasuries pro vided for under the, new Omaha charter. He is evidently afraid that if the two treasuries are reduced to one, half of his occupation will be gone. The sultan Is said to be awaiting unanimity in his cabinet before issuing an irade accepting the proposals of the powers regarding Macedonia; bnt It is barely possible he knows how to keep at least one of his advisers out of har mony with the others. An inquirer from Dondon Intimates that Omaha's Auditorium, costing 1 200,- 000, is "absurdly cheap." Better take off that temporary roof and put on the tiling called for in the original plans be fore our London admirer comes over on an Inspection tour. Governor LaFollette announces that he will accept the senatorshlp to which he was elected, but did not make the announcement until after he had an op portunity to tell the legislature what would be expected of It when he leaves the state house. Railroad construction In Omaha and South Omaha is progressing more rap idly than in any other part of the state. The mileage of sidetracks tn the new Jobbing territory exceeds that of the Omaha Lincoln Interurban by several laps. That New York life insurance com pany which paid $15,000 to prevent policyholders bringing suit to oust its president no doubt did It for the benefit of the policyholders, but it may have a hard time to make the policyholders realize It. Pat Crowe appears to have ceased to attract much attention in Omaha. No bouquets are being showered upon bim and the Omaha yellows have not even honored him with red headlines at the top of column, next to reading matter. A Rare Innovation. Philadelphia Press.

Baltimore American. The business men and farmers out in Butler county, Nebraska, who have de clared a freight and passenger boycott against the two railroads that have re fused to pay their taxes, have adopted a unique but effective way of getting even with the railroads for the Inconvenience to which they have been subjected in pocket and purse since the roads have been In errrears. Owing to the present heaviness of the grain traffic. It Is said that in a few days the roads will lose an amount equal to all taxes assessed against them. HOW THE 

LOST WAS SAVED. Kins; Corn's Early Troubles Fittingly Poetised. Chicago Inter Ocean. Speaking of this year's tl. M0, 000,000 corn crop. It might not be out of place to recall the fact that It was ruined repeatedly be tween planting time and harvest. Indeed, the nation has seldom had a corn crop that was ruined oftener or more completely, and, while the announcement that It Is the largest In our history was not unexpected by those familiar with conditions In the country, it could not fall to be a matter of surprise to city and town people every where that notwithstanding the number of times it was lost, it was finally saved. The phenomenon has not escaped the attention of one of the sweetest of our western singers, who begins by saying: The corn waa killed In early May, The floods had washed it quite away. And later on it died again And rotted 'neath the constant rain. And continues 1 Once more we tolled Its final knell; The seed had not been tested well. Yet. later it began to sprout. Then died. The weeds Lad run It out. And remarks further along And later yet, still thin and pale. It perished In a storm of hall. Then came a fierce and burning beat. It died that week of "fired" feet. And goes on to mention that And then the awful smut arrived And not a single stalk survived. And soon we -watched It in dismay l)ry up and shrivel quite away. Then came the last and saddest death; ' It wilted 'neato the frost king's breath. And points out that Nina times It died, and yet that fall We built new cribs to bold It all.

New Tork has an abundiince of water on all aides, but the quantity suited for drink ing purposes Is barely equal to the present demand. Millions upon millions of dollars have been Invested In securing the present supply from the Croton watershed. When originally planned this supply was consid ered sufficient to meet all demands for gen erations to come. Tet the growth of the city Is so rapid as to upset all calculations on this prime necessary. Even before the Croton plsns are fully completed the city authorities are considering plans for addi tional water supply to meet the needs of the future. These new plans comprehend securing new watersheds In the Catsklll mountains at an estimated cost of 112,nfK),. 000, capable of supplying B00.0O0.000 gallons a day. As usual, the estimates, large as they appear, are regarded as only a fraction of the cost. An Investigation of the legal phases of the problem convinced the city attorney that the expense of the project. If all demands were met, would amount to S00.000.ono. Purchase of the property needed Is but a fraction of the cost. Not only Is compensation asked where mills, factories and other business enterprises would be wiped out but every resident, grocer, butcher, doctor, clothier, laborer, etc., has put In demands. If met with, the claims would literally amount to life pension to the recipients. A steamship Is an Inn and the passenger on it has a right to the same protection as far as his belongings are concerned, as tn a hotel on land Is the decision Just reached by the New Tork state supreme court In Its appellate division. A passenger had a shirt and some ftvids stolen from a stateroom on a German Lloyds steamer while the vessel was lying In Nnples harbor. The New Tork court derides that the steamship company Is liable. Notices that the steamship com pany Is not responsible cannot change the law. This Is decided not by the desire of the common carrier, but by the settled de cisions of the court. William Waldorf Astor Is soon to erect a model apartment house tln Broadway. New Tork, near Central park. It will be the biff gest thing of Its kind anywhere on earth, but It will not be the tallest William Wal dorf, unlike his cousin, John Jacob, does not believe tn tall buildings for residential purposes. The new building will cover al most a city block, but will be only twelve stories high. When It Is stated that It will accommodate in large and comfortable rooms 1,600 persons some Idea of Its else may be had. There will be five miles of hallways, seventy miles of pipes and eight hydrostatic elevators running day and night. No apartment will be let under X1.0M a year. New York has a "skyscraper" church; there Is talk of building an eighteen-story recreation pier and now the city Is to have a twenty-story railroad terminal. The lower part of this structure will be used by the Hudson St Manhattan Railroad com pany, or better known as the McAdoo tunnel, which will furnish a link between Jersey City and the subway system In this city Junction being made at Dey street and Broadway. Preliminary to beginning the construction of the unique Manhattan terminal of the company work has begun looking to the demolition of the two blocks of old buildings on the west side of Church street, between Fulton and Cort landt the site of the terminal. As soon as the old buildings are removed and ex cavations completed the company will erect a twenty-story building on each block. - ' Suspended from a chandelier nvAP h la desk In the office of Police Commissioner McAdoo of New York is a lock of brown hair.

Crete Vldette-Herald : The next morning after election The Omaha Bee, Lincoln Journal and Lincoln Star estimated the majority of Letton somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000. The World-Herald was not quite ready to concede any majority, but the day following it cleared some of the cobwebs from its eyesight and placed tho majority in the vicinity of 12,000. It ought to propound to itself a growing question on majorities., Arlington Revlow-Herald : Governor Mickey, In a speech at Omaha the other day, declared that the railroad pass agita tion would be in evidence next year, and that there was no doubt In his mind as to whether two or three of the present state officers would be renominated for a second term. This paper sees no reason why state officers should be favored by the railroads unless they give value received in retvjrn, in which event the milk In the cocoanut Is accounted for.

The boy was arrested, taken before a judge and fined ISO. The boy had no money. To pay the fine meant that he must sell the very clothes rrom nis oack. And so he was sent to Jail, where he is paying the penalty for his sin. On the same day two wealthy owners of western Nebraska cat tle ranches stood before a Judge In Omaha, charged with the crime of - fencing and coveting to their own use thousands of acres of government land. The Judge fined each of the men taoo and ordered them into the custody of the marshal for six hours. The fine Imposed upon the boy who rolled a cigarette meant a toriune to mm. The fine Imposed upon the cattle barons meant a penny to them. The jail sentence meant to the boy close confinement and rough prison fare.
