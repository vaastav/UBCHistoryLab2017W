A four-year old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Adams was burned to death at its parents' home near Long view one night last week. The child's skirt ignited from contact with the fire and he was horribly burned before assistance reached her. She died shortly afterwards from the ef fects of the injuries. Xrw Em, Sam M. McKce and Miss ITnttie Kelly, both of the Longview neigh borhood, went over to Nashville last Wednesday and were quietly mar ried at the residence of Rev.

These, however, were most trivial cases, but there are a number of bad cases on the docket, and it promises to be a long and tire some tenn. The Avant case will hardly come up at this term. The grand jury found a true bill against him last week and ho v ill go over to the next term. It is a bad case and will be put off as long as possible. After disposing of another charge against Charlie Drake, the purpose is to take up John Gilmer's case. Gil mer is charged with the murder of another negro, Abe Clardy, in dis trict No. 4, some three years ago. He has had two trials, resulting in hung juries. This case will consume the remainder of the week and perhaps go over into next week. -A bad case disposed of yesterdwy was that of Teunie Hall, a white woman, charged with keeping a house of ill fame, corner of Frank lin and Tenth streets. This woman has a very bad character ; her case was up at the last term of the court, and the judge allowed it to go over on her promise that she would sell the orouertv and leave, or at least break up the place. Thi3 she has tailed to do, and the court gave her the extreme penalty of the law, $50 fine and six months in Jail. This will be the breaking up of this foul den, and the court is to be corn mended for it. The cases disposed of yesterday were as follows : Dock Edington. col., petit larceny not guilty. Dock and Lee Edington petit lar ceny not guilty. Will Johnson, col., petit larceny five cases, five years in the peniten tiary. Charlie Drake, the Nashville Black Bottom negro, who snapped his pistol .in Officer Stafford's face and assaulted another party with intent to kill, two cases ; convicted in the first case and sentenced for four yean in the penitentiary. The second case will be tried to-day." Ed Blair, col., petit larceny, ten months in the county workhouse. Ike Evans, col., gaming, one cent and cost. Harry Gupton, col., gaming, two cases, one cent and cost in each. Jeff Lockert, col., carrying pistol dismissed on paying the cost. Win. Shemwell, carrying pistol dismissed on paying the cost. . Death of the Great Hog, Gladstone. The Memphis Scimitar is perhaps mistaken in the statement that the great setter dog, Gladstone, died this city a few days ago. Cant. Pat Henry kept the dog here severa years, but from the best information we have, he was shipped to his own er, 1'. J I. Hyson, Memphis, two or three years ago. However, the dog is dead and he died with old age He was perhaps the most noted and valuable dog of his kind in the world He lived to be 11 years old and won more premiums and realized more money for his owner than was ever known of any other setter. His owner refused $5,000 for him ten yeirs ago, since then he has woi $25,000 in the stud, field trials and the sale of his progeny. "Buck's Brilliant" Wood & Viser's.

The Clarksville Bending Works, which started a few months ago, are meeting with unprecedented pros perity. Some six weeks ago a Chicago man came here and wanted to contract for every piece of timber that McKesson & Shaw could turn out. The firm refused to do this, but signed a contract for about two- thirds, amounting to 00,000 sets of wagon felloes, 500,000 spokes and other parts in proportion. Since that orders have bee pouring in from other quarters calling for stocks to double the capacity of the mill. The superior quality of the timber worked tiy these men gives the concern, it seems, a prestige over all others. They have invested $30,000 in the works and have been pushed lo their utmost to do this, and being unable to increase their operations without more money, they organized into a stock company for the purpose of is suing bonds. Messrs. H. C. Merritt, A. Howell and John Hurst have subscribed for shares and organized under the title of McKesson & Shaw Manufacturing Company. Mr. McKesson was elect ed president, Mr. Shaw secretary and treasurer, and the other gentlemen, with them, compose the board of di rectors. The company will add more build ings and increase the capacity of the works as fast as possible. It does look as if manufacturing will pay largely here. It only needs the man with energy, nerve and cap ital to make a success at anything and there are plenty of things that nays equally as well, if not better than this. Litteli's Living Age For 1801.

Death of an Aged Lady. Miss Loraine Eraser died at the home of Felix Northington, near Port Itoyal, last Saturday, at the ad vanced age of 75 "years. Some months ago she received a severe fall, sustaining injuries from which she never recovered. She had long been a devoted member of Harmony Baptist church, and her body was laid to rest in the Northington bury ing ground Sunday with services by her pastor. To Merchants. The publishers of the Leaf- Chronicle desire to keep their ad vertising columns as fresh as possl ble, and to this end they afford its patrons unusual latitude in frequent changes. They find it very incon venient to make these changes late in the day. however, and have been forced to establish a rule requiring copy for changes to be handed in be fore 9:30 a.m. of tho day on which the change is desired ; otherwise it may go over until the day following d,tf Maaonlo Election.

Mrs. Nina Hives, the wife of Plum mer Rives, of South Christian, died at her home last night, after four hours' illness. Mrs. Rives was first taken with something like cramp colic, of which she was relieved. A second attack followed in a very short while and she was in a dying condition when medical aid reached her. Ho physician pronounced the immediate cause of her death conjes tion of the brain. Another sad fea ture of her death was the absence of her husband, who had gone to the northern part of the county on busi ness. Mrs. Rives was a Miss Garrott; she was a Baptist and a most excel lent woman. The remains will be interred in the old Garrott family burying ground to-morrow. She left three children. The President's Message. Congress met yesterday and the Leaf-Chronicle presents its read ers with the president's message to day. It will be found on first page and will no doubt be scanned with interest, from curiosity if no other reason, to see how Mr. Harrison meets the defeat of his party. It ap pears that he has not learned any thing from the result of the late elec tion. He thinks the McKinley bill is misunderstood, and that is where he is mistaken. He also seems to think that the passage of the force bill will overcome the disaster. Another mistake. Elegant assortment of Sewing Lamps at Wood & Viser's. ll,15,d,tf George W.
