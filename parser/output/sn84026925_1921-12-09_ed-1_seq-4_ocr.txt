The question Of allegiance Which up to the last moment .threatened* to wreck the negotiations was surmounted by permitting the members of the Irish parliament to swear allegiance to the constitution of the Irish Free State and be "faithful to his majesty the king." The treaty has yet to run the gauntlet-of the Ulster government and of the ifupcrial parliament. The imperial parliament has been summoned to inert on December 14, and will bo opened in state by the king, who had taken the closest personal interest in the, Irish negotiations since be practically instituted them when he opened th<- Irish parliament.

Although keenly hurt by the cold shoulder which he said the medical profession of this country had turned toward him, l)r. Adolph Lorenz, famous Austrian, indicated Wednesday night he would probably continue to carry on his free clinics for cripples here. - lO' had announced earlier in the day ihat. he would abandon thein and return to Vienna. "I'll stay if they don't(throw me out." he said tonight. Pf.

' * ' There is no question about the fact that the next step in the real progress of our public school system is solution of the high school problem. The high school pupils are taking up too large a proportion of the time of the teachers in the two and three teaclier schools, and some way must be found under which the high school pupils can re| ceive nil the attention#they require I without neglecting the lower grades. . m n m? The disiiatchejr say than Premier Lloyd ^leorge "has" definitely" decided that ho will not. be qblc tb come to America to appear in the disarmament 'conference, because of the npproach' ing session of pairlWriient to deal with ;he winding up of Irish agreement. As much''as lie would, liko to make a speech to'theLYmorican people through tho arms conference, he I considers it far more important at this particular juncture lo remain at home. Tbf' 'voters ''of Sqtnh Carolina need : to take charge o^ their jofllcinT ma-j i?hiroi'v of course the lawyer will t continue to run that machinery as heretofore? but it should be for the people to say how. The people are just as competent to elect the judges as they are to elect other state, district and county officials. The time was, it should he remembered when even the state officers and representatives in congress were elected by the general 'assembly, and there was no more sense in that than there is in allowing the general assembly to elect judge.*/now. In the selection of Dr. J. I>. Johnson, of Itock Hill, for the presidency of flic South (Carolina Cotton Growers Association, that organization has placed at its head the best man ;it ooulcj have found in the state for the position. Dr. Johnson is a practical business man, a practical farmer, and a man of character, energy and'ability. As a farmer he ins had to meet and solve all the problems that have confronted other farmers?financial problems, labor problems, fertilizer problems, seasonal problems and everything else. Personally he has always cultivated a deep, broad, helpful sympathy for his fellow man generally" uud his fc|jpw farmers especially, and those who know and understand him fully appreciate that his only purpose in ever becoming a member of the eotton growers association was for the good lie wanted to do for others rather than I the benefit he expects to secure for himself. It is certainly that same motive that lias induced liini to accept I the place to which lie has just been elected, because en acount ef His large and prosperous personal business interests, ho could not possibly afford to give his time for any other considerj alien. There will bo a good deal of difference of opinion about the righteousness of that vurdict in the case of McFadden against the Anderson Motor Co. According to the testimony, the driver, of the car was running along where he had a right-to l>e, well within the speed limits,^and the. little girl was walking along where she ought to have been and in perfect safety. 'Ifie child suddenly sought to cross jthe street right in front of the automobile, all uuconcious of licr danger, of course. Under the circumstances it was almost a miracle that the child was 1101 kiiicu. The question before the jury was the measure of responsibility for the accident, and the jury found that the driver was responsible, not actually of j course; but technically. We do not question the jury's finding in tilt; mattor; but that the question was a close one there is no room for argument. What the supreme court will do remains to be seen. l!ut if the supreme court does uphold the verdict, it will undoubtedly be notice to automobile drivers that they must he on the lookout not only for persons who are directly in front hut for peopl who are on either side as well. In considering I i this matter tpq, it is very well to jceep frankly in hpi^d a, fact .tfeat Is, !Upde)-etood of all experienced aiitomobilists, that it is a quito" frequent happening for children to do just what the child in this case did?suddenly start across the street without looking behind for danger. If there is a suggestion In President Harding's message to congress that meets with our hearty approval more than anything else, it is that suggestion for a constitutional amendment to do away with any further creation of tax free securities. This tax free security ifiea is. o^t pf harmony with ^mericanism, undemocratic and vicious.

Men of large wealth get their money into this form of investment and then congratulate themselves on their exemption from the burden that they have helped to put on other people?tho peoplo who stand for progress and who keep tho country* going. There should be no such thing as tax free securities and the legislator'who stands for such a thing should bo ashamed of himself. We would like to see the constitution of the United States amended so as to prohibit tho further creation of * tax free securities and also we would like to see arr end of tax exemption in South Carolina, Tor whatever purpose. ' At the request of Senator Nells Christensen, ChhirAian ' of the "joint Legislative Committee on > Economy and Consolidation, we take pleasure.In helping to get;the statement that is printed elsewhere ip this issue to the people. As we see it, tho legislature of this state has for several years past been almost inbecilic. Instead of devoting itself mainly .to the all Important business of iaw and order, security to life and property it seems to have been acting mainly as the self constituted administrator of the proceeds of the ]>coples" industry. Instead of trying to promote self-government, it has been trying to govern. Instead of considering tho people as citizens, It has seemed to consider them as subjects. Instead of concerning itself with the equalization of taxation, it has seemed to be concerned only with the levying of taxes and sending money. Not Content to contlne itself to the fos'ering and development of the absolutely nwpsMi'v Dublic institutions, Jt JuiS been amusing itself with numerous nud vancd cxpcrfmcnts ali ne the expense of, the taxpayers, The statement /ram this, committee indicates that at least the legislative is beginning to come to its senses. The grumblings Of the people have become more nffd more audible, and there are indications that'they are approaching the danger lines of revolt. Except for the widespread crop failure and distress throughout a large part of the state, we would probably not have been offered the hope of relief that is now being held out. But however this may he, there is encouragement in the statement referred to. Taxes need to be reduced on the people, and wasteful extravagance needs' to be stopped. The burdens of government need to be more equally distributed and by all means there should be reform in our judicial system so that the laws may be administered in the interest of right and justice. By all the rules of the game, asplayed in the courthouse, Fatty Arbuckle was aoquitted of flic charge of manslaughter, against him in connection with the death of Miss Happe. Ask nine men out of ten and they will tell you that such is their opinion, and that opinion Nwlll Ik* confirmed by all the lawyers. But there cam^ a mistrial, because of what sonte sire pleased to call the "stubbornness" of a woman, Mrs. Helen M. Hubbard, who, satisfied of the guilt of the tiecuscd, and unwilling to credit the lying testimony of many of the witnesses, was resolved, as the foreman rather inelegantly, but none tiie less correctly described, to stajk there until "hell frOze over." What were the facts? A sensual beast with an unlimited bank roll, gathers together a number of his kind for an unspeakable orgie of drunken debauth cry in a great hotel. On? of the women is injured unto death through the act of Arbuekle., No, lie did not mean to kill her of course, or even to hurt her; but nevertheless he did. In stress and excitement of tho moment, each in trying to excuso himself or hcrsi'f talked. Indictments followed. By the help of his money Arbucfele employed tijo ablest lawyers to be, had, and he also hired doctors and others. Witnesses changed their stories. The truth that had been told under . t ic stress.of excitement was obanged to deliberate lies on the witness stand. Itappc liiid others, it was made to appear were accidental and unwelcome guests. Huppc's injuries were tho result of mysterious, but none the less natural causes, and tho Arbuckle boast had done nothing but try to relieve the distress to the contribution of which he) had done nothing. There was not a man or woman 011 that jury who was deceived by any of the lies that were told. There was not a man or woman on that jury who was not satisfied that the (ruth had been suppressed. Mrs. Helen M. Hubbard realized fully that she could not acquit wunoui ivinp unu she refused to acquit. Arbuckle stands the same as if he had never been tried, and the world is beginning to learn that women are really fit for Jury service. All honor t<> Mrs. Helen M. Hubbard smv we.
