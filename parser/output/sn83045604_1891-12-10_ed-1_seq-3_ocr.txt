A— (Sew York World ■ra cial.}— The substance of President Harrison's statement on Chilean affairs was received today, and is the subject of universal comment. It is regarded by the Chileans as decidedly threaten ing a rupture, ana it is not believed that the Chilean government will consent either to au apology or material indeinu.ty. The majority in congress is known to b* to any concessions, an i the Chilean government would find it difficult to carry the necesssry •upport for any humiliating measures. It is now no secret that the govern meat is pro ceeding actively with warlike preparations, and artillery of the latest manufacture has been ordered from Germany. The situstion is complicated by Spain's demsud for s larte indemnity. The Chileans have always detested the Spaniards and their hatred a quickened by this demand. They would challenge fpatn if they had not the L' lilted States to deal with. Captain Schley re fused to express an opinion as to the president's message, but wat evidently pleased. General Valssques, who was m n;ster of war under the B»1 reared* regime, and who, nr>on the fall of Valparaiso, sought teiupo-arr refuge in the Oerman legation, lei t that asylum some time ago. and has since been in h.diug. He sur rendered himself to the military tribunal yester day. after having received guarantees from In tendente I ira. of Santiago, that he would be dealt with fairly. It is stated that British Minister Kenaely was not aware of the shipment of silv .-r by Baltna eeda on feard the British vessel iweigie until after she had sailed from Ta calms no. 

LONDON, Dec. 9.—Tbe Ttmea today publishes a dispatch from ite Santiago de Chile correspond ent stating that Insulting notes written to tbe government by United states Minister Ei;au and his own telegram* to his government caused a proposition to be made that Chile suppress her legatiou at Washington City. Th.s propo sition was dlscu*se J at a meeting of the finance coratnit'.ee of the house of representatives last night, but the government declined toa.upport the proposal.

When the clique was pushing up the price last month many shorts sougit to recover themselves by selling the year, believing there would be plenty of contract corn on the market in December, but the results have been disappointing. For a week or so rumors of a tig desl have f>een rife, and to lay, wheu so.id names were attached to these rumors the shorts went wild.

Superintendent Neff and Engineer Scnr tieid, after remaining on the sround incessantly since Mondav ei ening. came into the city yes terday morning and collected a new force of 10) men to relieve those who have became ex hausted, and took them up the road in tho after ternoon. In an interview with a POST-INTELLI GENCER reporter Mr. Neff said: "When we were coming down on the south bound train on Monday we did not encounter any storm until we rescued Edmonds. Th're we caught the full fury of a southwest gale, the waves rising twenty-five feet high and spray dashing against the car windows. None of the cribbing was washed out, fur the wash-outs were only in places along the »hore where it was thought unnecessary to put any cribbing. In these places the waves dashed against the bank and scraped the earth out undernearth the track. The re moval of the slide is a very laborious task, for it is mostly blue clay, which sticks hard and ia very difficult to h anile. In order to prevent slides in the future we shall pile and bulkhead the earth along the shore side of the track. The south-bound train due in this city at 6:10 in the evening, and which has been delayed by the slide since Monday, arrived In this city about 8:30 o'clock last evening. At that time the slide had been cleared away sufficiently to allow trains to pass, and work was continued all nignt. Trains will run today, and after to day will run both ways regularly. The storm on Monday washed out 400 to 500 feet of track on the Burrows Bay Improvement Company's road on Fidalgo island.

On Swinomish flats some of the dykes burst for the first time since they were built aud about 300 acres of laud were Hooded.

Gill then called Marius to the witness box. He denitd his wife's cha'ge that he had never contr buted to her support.
