Ulic Svmc lovtttcvnci FRIDAY, DECEMIlEU HI, 1880. STATE OF THE COUNTRY. The Prosidcnts Annual Message, Fedlow-Cttfcns of the Renate and Houses of Hop. rvso-atatives : I congratulate you on tho continued and in creasing prosperity of our country. By the favor of Divine liovidcnce we have been blessenl, during the pant year, with health, with abund ant harvest, with profitable employment for all our ieople, nd with contentment at hcino, and with peace and friendship with other nations. The eiceurrenee of the twenty-fourth election of Chief Magistrate has u Horded another op portunity to tho peoplo of the Un tod State to exhibit to tho world a significant example of tho peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of Govermueut from the public servant w'hose terms of ollioo are about to expire, to iTicir newly -chosen success or. This example cannot fail to impress pro foundly thoughtful people of other countries with Uo advantage which republican institu tion afford. Tho immediate, general and cheerful aeepiiesceneo of all goeHi citizens in the result of the election given grutifying assurance to our country and to it friends throughout tho world that a Government based on the free consent of anintehigeut and patriotic people peissosses elements of rdrength, stability and pcruiauency not found ia any other form of Government. Continued opposition to tho full and free en joyment of tho right of citizensliip, conferred upon tho colored peoplo by the recent amend ments to tho constitution, still prevails in sev eral of the lato slave-holding States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in tho recent election to any large oxtont in acts of violence or mtimidation. It hs, however, by fraudu lent practices iu connection with tho ballots, with the regulations as to the place and manner of votin, and with counting, returning, and canvassing tho votes cast, been successful in de feating the excrcb-o of the right preservative of all rights, tho ngtit of suffrage, which tho con stitution expressly confers upon our enfran chised citizen. It is tho desire of the good pooplo of tho whole country that sectionalism as a factor iu our politics should disappcur. They prefer that no sec ion of the country should lo united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to rcinso a prompt and hearty obe dience to tho equal-right amendm nts to tho constitution is all that now stand in the way of a completo obliteration of sectional lines in oar political contests. As long as either of these amendments is fiagrantly vio lated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that tho people who placed them in tho constitution, as embodying the le gitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and nece ssary. will coutinuo to act to gether, and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the en joyment of the right by ev.-ry American citizen who has the requisite qu hfication to freely cast his ot and to nave it honestly counted. Wit h this question rightly settled, tho country will bo re Loved of tho contentious of the past ; by gones will indeed le bygones, and political and party issues with respect to economy and effi ciency of administration, internal improve ments, the tarff, domestic taxation, educa tion, finance and other important subjects will then receivo tluir full uhaof atten tion ; but resistance to and unification of the results of tho war will unite together in res olute purpose for their support all who main tain tho authority of tho Government and tho perpetuity of the Union, and who ad quately appreciate the value of tho victory achieve L This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeing to any part of the people of our conntrv, oT to any of their interests. The inviolability of tho amendments rests upon the fundamental principles of our Government. They are Uih oleum expression of tho will of the people of tho United states. Tho sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our c.tizens must te maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Government of the country. Happily, the his tory of the late election shows that in many Farts of the country where opposition to the iftcenth amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease al together, if firm and well-oousidered ac tion is taken by Congress. I trust the House of lU-picsentatives anl the Senate, which have the right to judgo of tho elections, ro tnrnsand qualification of their own member., will Bee to it that every case of violation of the letter or fpirit of the Fifteenth amendment is thoroughly imestinted, and Unit no erne-fit fioin mch viuUt ion shall accrue to any person or party. Itwi.l lc tho duty of the Exeeuli o, with -ntncient appropriation for tho purpo-o, to prosecute unsparin.ly all who have been en gaged in depriving citizens of tho rights guar anteed them by the constitution. It is not, however, t lo forgotten that the best and surest guarantees of tho primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that ca pacity for self-preite ctiou which can N long only to a eoplo whose ril.t to universal suffrage is supported by unieii 4 ducatiou. Tho means at ttie command of tV local an l State anthori t ce are, m many e;.Ve s, wholly iunele q uite to famish fno instruction to all who need it. T .-is is especially true where, before emancipa tion, tho education of the ieoplo was ne-gbct-cd or prevented, in tho interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that tho m'ject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of tho whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by tho Government of the United States. I respectfully recommend that Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safe-guards, supplement the local edu cational fund in tho Bcveral States whero the crave duties and re p mobilities of citizenship bavo been devolved ou uneducated jieople, by devoting to the puqoeo grants of tho public lands, aud, if necessary, by appropriations from the treasury of the United Scutes. What ever Government can fauly do to promote free popular education ought t bo done. Wherev r general education is found, jxace, virtue aii'l social ordir prevail, and civil and religbus liberty are tocuro. Iu my former ann'nl miages, I have asked tho attention of Congress to tho urgent neces sity of a r formation of the civil seni-e sys tem of the Government. My views eo:u rHing tho dangers of patronage, or rppontments for personal or panics n eoni (orations, liavo been rtrengthened by my oherv..tien and exirt enco in the Executive clli , nnd I Is-bevo tliese dangers threaten the stability of the Govern ment. Abuses so w nous-'m their nature can not bo p-mum-idly tolented. They tend to become inoroal ruling w.th the enlargement of cdmini-trativo service, as tho growth of the founiryin popn'ation incresscs the number of officer and pl.tce-mm emploved. The reasons are imperative for tho adoption of fixed rules f r tho regulation of a p (oint ments, promotion an l removal, establishing uniform methoil, having exclusively in view, iU ever UHt.t !!!, tho attain ncnt of tho host qualification for tho position in question. J'ueh a rue thel a'nno i consilient with the e-qual righ's of all eitiz ns. und tho most e-co-. noinicjil nd efiic.ent administration of the pub lic hnitie. ComjKtitlvo examinations. In aid of impartial appointments and promotions, have boon con ducted for sonic year past in several of the Executive Departments, and by mv direction Ibis sys em lifts len ar'o ted in the C is em House ind Petste flics of the 1 rger it ic of the countrv. In the city of New Yoik over two tlons n 1 po ibons In the civil service havo been subject, in their apponwents and tenuro of pl.ieo, to the or ration of pub lished rules for this purpose, during tho past two tears. The n units of theso practical trnls h ave beon very satioTadorr, ami have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system af selection. All sro su,jcctel t the Mtn tests, and the result i fne from prejudice by personal favor or partisan infltienee. It se cures for the position appliod for the lwst qualifications attaiaablo among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure of importunity, which, under any other course pursued, largely exact the time and attention of appointing ofiiccrs, to their great detriment in tho discharge of other official duties, prevent ing the abuso of tho service for tho mere fur therance of private or )wrty purposes, and leav ing tho employe of tho Gov rnnient, fr ed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to d pend solely upon merit for retention and ad vancement, and with this con.-Uiit incentivo to ixrrtion and improvement. These invaluable results havo leen attained in a high degree in tho office where tho rules for Hp) ointment by competitive examination have been applied. A method which hna so approved itself by experimental testa at points wlu ro such tests may bo fairly considered conclusive should 1 extended to all suls.rdinato )osi tic ns under tho Government. I believe that strong and grow ing public sentiment demands immediuto meas ures for securing aud enforcing tho highest posdWe efficiency in the civil m Trice, and its tirottf'Otion from rectgnizd abuses, and that he exKTienco nf erred to has demonstrute-d thp feasibility of such measures. The examinations in tho Custom Houses and To-toftices havo been held under many embar rassments, and without prov sion for compen sation for tho extra labor performed, by the of ficers who havo conducted them, and whoso commendable interest in tho improvement of the public pervieo ha inluood this devotion of time and lalor whithout pecuniary reward. A continuance or these lalmrs gratuitously ought not to be expected, anl without an appropria tion by Congress for compensation it Ls not practicable to extend the svstem of examinations generally throughout tho civil service. It i alo highly important that all such eliminations ttboidd be conducted upon a uniform system and under peneral suiKivision. Se-ctioii 1,753 of the lie vised Statutes authorizes tho Presi dent to prescribe the regulations for admission to tho civil service of tho United States, and for this purpoHo to employ suitable person to con duct tho requisite inquiries with ref rence to the fitness of each candidate, in respect to ago, health, chancter, knowledge, and abilrtv, for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter but tho law is practically inoper ative for the want of the requisite appropria tion. I therefore recommend an appropriation of 25,000 jxr annum to meet tho expense of a commission, to t-e appointed by the President in acccordanco with tho terms of this section, whoso duty it shall be to e'eviso a just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examina tions, and to supervise the application of the samo throughout tho entire civil service of t he Government. Iam pursiiadcd that the facili ties whi'di such a comuUsion will afford for testing tbo fitness of tboso wlo apply for office will not only lo as welcome a relief to members of Coneress a, it will 13 to tho President and heads of depart ments, but that it will also greatly tend to re move tho causes of embarrassment which now inevitably ana constantly attend tho eoutl cting claim of patronage beitwocn the Legislative nd Executivo departments. Tho most effect ual check ujon tno pernicious comjxtition of influence and official favoritism in tho best waJ of office will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between tho applicants, in which every ono can make his own record, with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone. I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer a free as any other citizen to express bis political oj inions and to use hi means for tlu ir advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safo a any private citizen in refusing all demand upon hi salary for iKilitica purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and juBtico to aJl who are engaged in tho public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions against t. use of official authority to coerce the )olit ca action of private citizen or of official subordinates, U greatly to bo desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of tho civil service, and cs) social ly to a reform in tho method of appointment and removal, ha been found to be the prac tice', under w hat is known as tho spoil system, by which the appointing power ha been so largely e;ucroachel upon by members of Cen gress. 'The rJrst Rtp in tho reform of tho civil (service must bo a completo divorco i etween Congress and tho Executive in the matter of appointments. Tho cor rupting doctrine that 'to tho victors In-long tho spoils" is inseparable from Congres sional patronago a tho established rule and practice of parties in power. It comes to bo understood by applicant for offico, and by the jieoplo generally, that Representatives snd S nators are entitled to disburse the patronago of their rcspeetivo district and .states, "it is not necess.iry to recite at length tho evils resulting from this invasion of the Executive functions. The true pnncip'cs of gov rnment on the snbject of rppointn.ei ts to offi e. as stated iu the National Convention of the leading parties of tho country, have again and again been approved by the American peo ple, and have not l-eeu cjd.ed in question m uiiy q latter. Thcso authentic expressions of pu'-lio opinion upon this all-important subject ale the statement of principle that belong to the constitutional structure of tho Goern tueiit. "Under tho constitution tho President aud beads of departments are to mako noiuiiii-tious lor office. Tho Seriate is to advise and consent to appoint men's, and the Houso of llepiesen tutitcs is to recuse and prosecute faithless offi cers. Tho t est intc restf t'io pibhc servico demand that those distinction le respected ; that Senators and Representatives, who may be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to of t'ue." To t':i end the eo-o;ration of tho Legislative Department of tho Govenmi nt i required, ali e by the necessities of tho case and I y public opinion. Memoirs of Con.-cre-s will not teieioved from tho dem: nd mode u mm them with re'erenco to appo ntmeiits to office unt.l, by legislative enactment, the u r n cioii )-rhctiro i coudemne-d and forbidden. It is the re lore recommended that anact.be assul defining the relation of member of Congress with referenco to appointment to of fice by tle Pr sidt nt, and I also recommend that the provisions of section 1,707, and of the -eetion following, of the Revi-ed Statutes, eomptiiing the lenure-of -Office act, of March 2, 1N57, Ikj repealed. Iklioving tnat to reform the system and mithi.d of the oivil service in our couutro is one of tho highest and mot imperative duties of statesmanship, and tiiat it can bo per manently done only by the co eferution ol the Legi-1 .tivo and Executive Departments of the Governmo: t, I again comnand tho whole sub ject to your considerato attention. It i the rooogii'zed duty and purpose of tho people of tho United States to suppress Indyainy where it nov exist in our Terri orics, ainl to prevent it extension. Faith ful anil zealous efforts have leen made by the United St t a authorities in Uiali to rii torce the law against it. ExiM-rie-nc has sliOA-n that tho legislation upon this subject, to bo effective, require extensive mo litiga tion and amendment. The longer action is delay-d, tho more ilifiicult it will Ikj to ac oomi lish what i desired. Pi omit and de cided measures are necessary. The Mormon si-etarian organiz dion which u hoM polygamy hi the wiiolo )ower of making und t-xeetiting the local legislation of tho Territory. Ry its control of th" grand an 1 ts iit juries, it possesses Isrgo intlueiice over tiie administra tis n of ju tee. Exercising, as tho hood of this sect do, tbo local po itical power of thv Ti rritory, they aro ablo to make e flVo ttvo tleir liosthty to the law of con gress on the Hibject of polvamv, and. in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be nlohst.ed if the enforcement of tho law d. p ndnou thoe who practice and uphold the crime. It cm only lo suppressed by tpkin;; nwny thy )H)litical power of Ut seet wdch cn couragf! and snain it. The jximit f Con gress to enact miitabb lw Ui piotct tbo Ter ritories i ami lc. Ii inot a ca.se of hdf-way measures. Tho political jower of the Mormon sect is iucreas ng ; it controls no one of our weuhhiest and most populo is Territories, It is extending steadily into other Terri tories. Wh rover it goes; it est blishes po lygamy and se-tarian political power. Toe Mndity of marriage ani the family relation are the corner-stone of our American society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separa tion of church and at te are among the ele mentary idoa a of free iustitnt'on. To re-establish the interests and principles which po lygamy and Mormoniwm have imperilled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and ruinous immi grants of all creed that part of our domain which has U-en, in a great degree?, closed to general immigration by intolerant aud immoral in-titutions, it i recommended that tho Gov ernment of the Territory of Uiah le reorganized. 1 recommend that Congress i rovido for the government of Ctali by a Governor and Judge--; or Commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analogous to tho pmvi iotial government estals lldied for tho territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance or 1787. If, howeverit is deemed best to ronthmo tho existing 0rm of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, bold office, and sit on juries in the Terri tory of Utah bo confined to those who neither practice nor uphold )o!ygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it i belie-vM that within a few years tho evils which now afllict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in good time lcomo one of tho most prosjK-r-ons and attractive of tho new States of tho Union. Our relation with all foreign countries have leen those of nndbtnrbed pence, au 1 bavo presented no evasion lor concern as to then continued maintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from tho Rritirih Government to tho demand of in demnity to eur fishermen for the injuries suffered by that Industry at Fortuno bay, in January, 1S7H, which I expressed in my last annual Message, was disapiointed. This answer was rcoeiveaV only in tho latter part of April in tho present year, and, when re-ce-ivid, exhibited a failure of accord lxtwcen the two Governments, ns to the measure of the inshore-fiething privilege seeurrcd to our Ibdiermeu by tho treaty of Washington, ot so serious a character "that I made it the subject of a communication to Congress, in which I recommended tho adoption of tho measure which seoinen to me proper to bo taken by this Government in maintenance of the rights accorded to our fishermen under the treaty, and toward securing an indemnity for tlio injury these interest had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendation wa under consideration by tho House) of Representatives at the time of the adjournment of Congress iu June last. Within a few week I have received a com munication from her Majesty' Government, renewing the consideration ef tlie subject, loth of the indemnity for tin injuries at Fortuno bay, and of thu interpretation of the treaty in wliich tiie previous correspondone'o had shown the two Government to bo at variance. Uron Ixith these topic tho disposition toward a friendly agreement Ls manifested by a recogni tion of our right to an inde-muity lor the trans action at Fortuno bay, leaving tlie measure of such indemnity to further conference, and by an assent to th view of this Government, presented in tho pre1ou8corresjoudcu',e, that the regula tion of conflicting interest of the shoro fishery of the provincial seacoasts, and the vessel fish ery of our fishermen, should bo made tho sub iectof oonfeivnco and concurrent arrangement U-tween tho two Governments. I sincere hone that tho basis may be found for a speedv adjustment of the very serious di vergenco.of iew in the interpretation of tho fishery clauses of tho treaty of Waslungton, which, as the correiHUidouco bet wet u the two Governments stood at tho last session of Con gress, Boe-med to bo irreconcilable. In tho important exhibition of arts and in dustries, winch wa held last year at Sydney, New South Wale), a well a in tint now in progress at Mtlouurno, tho United State have b en efficiently and honorably represented. The exhibitejrs from thi country at the former place received a largo nutub- r of award in some of tho most considerable departments, and tho participation of tho United States was rt cogniea by a special mark ofd . sanctum. In tho exhibition at Melbourne, tho share tikenby our country is no Jess notable, and an equal ele greo of success i confidently expected. Tho stato of peaeo anp tranquillity now en joyed i'V all the nations of tne continent of Europe ha its favorat.lo influence uikjii our diplomatic and commercial relation with them. We have concluded and ratified a conv ntion with tho French republic for tho settlement of claim of tho citizens, of either country against tjT J other. Under this convention a commis sion, presided over by a distinguished publicist, appointed, in pursuance of the n quest of both nations, by Hi Majesty,, tho Emperor of Rrazil, has txen organized and ha beguu its sessions in this city. A congress to consid er mean for the protection of industrial prop erty has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed tho Ministers of tho United States in Franco and in lielgium as del egates. The International Commis-ion usn Weight and Measures ulso continue its work in Paris. I invito your attentiou to the neces sity of an appropri ition to be made m time to enable thi Government to comply with it ob ligation under the Metrical C nventiou. Our trie in fly relation with the German em pire continue without interruption. At the recent Iu'.e-rnation A Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries, at Rerhn, the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to nu.ke its prepurdious, wa extremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitor numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at hiyo the principal prize of honor offered by His Majesty, tne Lmicrur. The results of this great success can not but lx) advantageous to thi important and growing iiulu try. There hive been some question r.dsed between the two Govern ment as to tho proper effect and interpre tation of our treaties of inturaliz ition, but recent diqmtches from our Minister at Reilin shov that favorable progros is nuking toaard an understanding, in iceot d nice with the view of this Govertiim-nt, which makes and udm ts no dw iuctioii between the right of a native and naturalize d citizen of the I'nite-d State. In practice, tho complaints of m ilestatiou stiffeied by naturalized ci.izeu abroad havo never been fewer than at present. There is nothing of importance to nete in onf nnbroken friendly relation with the Gov ernments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portu gal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. DniiUg tho last Bnmmer several voscis be longing to tho me reliant marine of thi coun try, sailing it; neutral water of the West In dies, were liivd at, boarded, and searcheel by au armed cruiser of tho Spanish Government. Tbo eireiiMista rvs, as reported, involve not only a private injury to tho per sons concerned, but also "se-emed te little observant of tho friendly relatim s exbting for a century betweeu this eoun'ry and Spain. The wrong was brought to the att ntion of tho Spanish (iove rnme nt in a s r.ous ) rote-st aud remonstrance, and the) matter i mide-ro 'ng investigation by tho roya authorities, with a view to sinh expl. n ition or repmat on a may be cilleil fi r by the fact. The commission siting in th city for the adjudication ef claim of our citizens against the Gove rnment of Spain i-, I hope, approach ing the terinm .tion of ts l.ilors. The claims against the Unite d Stdes under the Florida tie ut with Spain were sulmitted to Congress for it fctioii at the lato session, and again invite your attention to the long standing question, with a view to the final dis position of the math r. At tlui invit'tion of the Spanish Government, a e onf em-rice has n-e-e ntly lie-en held at tho cit; of Madrid to consider 'the su eject or protec tion by fore i tr n tower of native m.r ii the empire of Monaco.

Tlie Imperial Government was tro- p- reel to give prompt cud resjHKtfid atten- I tion to tlio matter orougiit under negotia tion, and tho conferences jiroceeded with such rapidity and success that, em the 17th of November last, two treaties were signexl at Pi lin, one relating to the introduction ef Chi nese into this couutry, and ouo re lating to eom-m-rce Mr. IVescot, ono of the Commissioners, h now on his way homo bringing the treaties, and it is t xpeHted that they will bo receiveel in season to bo laid befoi-e the Sena to eaiiy hi Jamrary. Our JIhiisteT in Japan has negotiated a con venti n for tiie reciprocal relie f of shipwree ked se'iinien. I take occasion to urge once more upon emigre the projirietv of making provis ion for the erection ef suitable fire-preof build ings at the Japanese capital for tho use of the American legitien, and the Court Il mso and jail conne cted with it. Tho Japanese Govern ment, with groirt generosity and courtevy, ha offereel for till purpose an eligible piyoe of land. In my last annual message I inviteyl the at tention of Congress to the subject of the in-de-mnity fumls ix:ceiveMl some year ago from Clii na and Japan. 1 renew tlio rccommenda tieui then made, that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citize ns should be promptly paid, and tho residue returned to tho uatioiiH,"resis'Ctivcly, to which they justly and equitably lelong. Tlie extradition treaty with tho kingdom of the Netherlands which has been for some time iu course of nege iation, has, during tho pat year, been coneiuded and duly ratified. Re lations of frieiielship and amity havo been established between the Government of the United Statou and that of Roumanis. We have sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have ren iveel at this eiapital the spe-cial Envoy who ha len charged by bis Itoval Highness Prince Charles to announce tho inde-)H-ndent sovereignty of Roun-mia. We hope for a spee'ely deveiopment of co imiercial rela tion betAven-u the two countries. In inv Last annual message I expressed the hope that tho prevalence of qniAude en the border I t ween this country and Mexico would soon become se os'nreil a to justify the modi fication of tho orders, then in force, to our military commanders, in regard to cross ing tho frontier, without encouraging such disturbance- a would enlanger the peace of tho two countries. Event moved in oevorelane'o with these, expectations, and the orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our citizen and the Me'xi-ian Government. Subsequently the pence of the border was again elisturbenl by n savage foray, uude-r tJio command of the Chief Vict ono, but,by tho cenn ined and harnionioue action of the military forces of both countries, bis band has len 'broken up und substantially de stroyed. Thero i reason to be:lievo that the o'-stacles which havo so long prevented rapid and con venient communication lietween the United States and Mexico by railways aro on the point of disnpiiearing, and that several unpoitant entei prise of this character w.il noon lie set on foot which cannot fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries. New Envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, B' livia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have recently airived at this capital, who e distinction and enlighte nment afford the K-st guarunteo of tlio continuance ef friendly relations between our-aelve-s and theny si-h r reimbiies. The re;lat:en.s Is-twe-e-n thi Government and that of tho Unite-d State of Colombia have en gaged pubic attention during the past year, m .inly by l en son of tlie project of an iuter oceaiuc can il across the Isthmus of I'anama, to be built by private capital under a con cession from the Colombian Government for that purpose. The treaty el 'ligations sul sisting lie-tween tlie United States and Cj1 omoia, by which we guarantee, the neutrr.l ity of tho transit and the sovereignty and projicrty of Co'ombia iu the isthmus, mako it neees.iry that tho coudiiions under which so stuiendou a change in the region embraced iu this gUH rant e-c should lc effe-cte'd transforming, a it would, thi Isthmus, from a barrier betwee n tho Atlantic and Pacitic eKvaus, into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the' navie s and me rchant ship of the world should receive tho approval of this Government, as being compatible with tho discharge of theso obligations on our part, and consistent with our interest as the principal com mercial power of the 5ostern hemisphere. Tho view wliich I expressed in a special message to Congies m March last, in i elation to this project, I deem it my duty again to press upon your attention. Subse quent consideration has but confinned tho I'iiiion "that it i the right and duty of the Umted States to axw rt and maintain such -nK:ivbi jn and autln r'.ty over any inter-ix-ennic caml acros tho isthmus that connects Vorth and South America a will protect our national interest." . Tim war betwej -n tho repubMo of Chili on tho one hand, and the aliied republics of Peru and llolivia on the oth- r, stnl centimes. This Oo e inment ha not fe t calh-d upon to interfere in i cutest that is within the beligerent right of the p.ti tie-s a inde-p -nde-ut states. Wo have1, hicvevcr, always bcJd our.e lvt s in readiness to nd in accommodating the ir difference, and have i' I'iiT- roi-t time reminded both belligerents of ur willingness to render such sen ice-. Our good offices in this direction wero re cently acce; tod b all tho lciligeien4s. ind it eas hoped they would prove effioacious ; but I n-gntto annmn'e that tlio measures which the Ministers of tlio United State at Santiago ind Lima were authorized to take, with the iew to i ling about a peace, wero not success ful. In tho courso of tho war soma qi stion iave arisen nffojtuig neutral rights ; in all of I i so the Ministers ef the Unitexl States hive, under their instJiiciions, acted with promptness nd e-iie r. y m protection of American interest. The relations of tho United State's with the emir re of Rrazil coutinue to le most cordial, and their comnu rc al intercourse steadily in rcases, to their mutual advantage. Ti e inti rnal disorders with which the Argen tine Republic has for some timo past been 'filict eel, Mid which have moro or less influ ence I its extermd trado, are understood to have been brought to a close. This lmppy result urny be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that republic as .veil a to the development of it vast interior resources. In Samoa, the Government of King Mali toa, under tho support and recognition of die Consular representative of the United taes, Great lb i tain and Germany, seems o have riven peaco and tranquillity to the s'ands.

In puiKuane-o of the act passe-el at the last session or C-mgress, tnvitatioii have been ex tended to foreign maritime state-a to join in a smitary confeie-nco in Wanhinton, be ginning the 1st of Janimry. The ae-ceptanco of this mvit tion by many promine nt )owir give t ronnVeof unoce s in thi important mesanro, designed to eUtdish a syst m of inte rnatioud notification by wl ich tlio spread of hirectiou or cindeu do diseases maybe nwire effective ly cheoke'el or )reventeL The attention of Cem gress i invited to the necessary appropriations for carrying into effect the pro-islona of the act The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United Stales, through tho active agency of Consular officers and through tho dUseinintt'ou of in sinuation obtained from them, have been un relaxed. Tho interest in these effort, as do ve loped in our commercial communities, and tho value of the information sen-ured by this means to tbo trade and manufactures of the country, wero recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was mado for tho more frequent publica tion of Cemsular and other report by the Department of State. The first issue of thi publication ha now been prcpsred, and nlequent issues may regularly bo exjievted. Tlie importance and interest attached te the re port of Consular offi "ers aro witnessed ly the gcue ral demand for them by all classes of mer chants and manufacturers engaged iu our for eign trade. It is believed that tho system of such publication is deserving of tho approval of Congress, and that the njcessary appropria tion for it continuance and enlargement will commend itself to your consideration. Tho prosperous energies of our doinostio in dustries, and their iminonce production of tho subje cts of foreign commerce, inure, and even veqi)ire, an active development of tho wishes and interests of our people iu that dreeti u. Especially important is it that our commeni d relations with tho Atlantic and radio eerts of South America. wi:h tho West Inelie- and tho Gulf of Mexi -o should bo direct, and not through tho circuit of Europe-an systems, and should te carried on in our own bottom. The full appreciation of tho opentunities which our front on the Pacific ocean give to ceanmerce w ith Japan, China aud the East Indie, vJlh Australia, and the island group w hich lb) along the route of navigation, should inspire e qual efforts to appropnato to our own ship ping, and to administer by our own capital, a duo proportion of thi trade. Whatever moeliti. cations of our regulations of trado and nauga tion may bo necessary or useful to me-et and direct theso bon-i'sos to tho rnlaree ment of our exchanges and of our car rying trade, I am suro tho wisdom of Congress will be ready to tupply. One initial measure, however, seem to bo so clearly use ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seem to le very evident that tho provision of regular steam postal commumoatiou, by aid from Govern ment, has been tlio forerunner of the commer cial predominan e of Great Rritain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trado is now the desire and intent of our )Honle. It is also ma n i fest that tho effort of other En ropean nations to couteud with Great Rritaiu for a share of thi commerce have been successful in proportiem with their adoption ef regular steam-)xstal communica tion with the markets whose trado they sought, Mexico and the state of South America are anxious to receive such postal communication with thi couutry, anl to aid in their develop ment. Similar co operation may lo looked for, in dim time from tho Eastern mtions and from Austr.dii. It. iadiffi ult to see how the lead in this movement can Ikj e-xpectod from private interests. In re j ect of l'oreigu commerce-, qu te as much as iu internal trade, )stal com muni Mt ion seem necessarily a mat ter of common and publ.c administration, anl thus pertaining to government. I respectfully recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as may cemduco tt tho development of our foreign commercial ex change au i the building up of our carrying trade. In thi connection I desire also to suggest the very great service which might bo ex)sxrtcd. in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific ocean were a transmarine cablo laid from San Francisco to the Sandwie-.li islands, and thence to Japan at tho north anl Austra lia at tho south. Tlio great influence of such means of (communication on theso routes of navigation, in developing and securing tho due share of our Pa cific coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustration or enforcement. It may bo that such an enterprise), useful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private invest ment, may neeal to be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress iu its aid, and 1 Biibniit tho matter to yrur careful consideration. An additional, and not uuiniportant,although secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging tho navy "may lo found m tho unquestionable service to tlie expan don to our commerce, which would te) rende-red by the fioqueut circulation of naval ship iu the seas and torts of all qu r ters of the globe. Ships of the projier construction and eq-.iip.ncnt, to bo of tho greatest efficiency in case of mari time war, might be) mado cons ant and active agents in timo of peiaoe) in the ad vancement and pretention of our foreign tnide , nnd in the nurture and discipline ef young sea men, who would, naturally, in some numbers, mix with and inwove tho crews of our mer-chant-ship. Our merchant at homo and abroad recognize the value to foreign com merce of an active movement of our naval ve-s-sels, and the intel'iciv:o an I patriotic zeal of our navrl eitfioeT in iremoting e verv interest ' of their countrymen u a jmt subject of rutidti j al pride. 1 Tho condition of the financial affair of tho Government, us shown by the report of the S-cretaryof the Treasury, is very satisfactory. I It is bclieu-d th it the present fihuictal situli J tiou of tlie Unite 1 t :te, whether e-nnsideied with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing I wealth, or tho extent and variety of our iv I sources, is more f.ivorablo than that ol : any other country of our tune, and his j never I ecu surpassed by tint of any I country at any icnod of b history.

I.'o cemsideral le amount eif United Htats notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sum of gold bullion, both doniestic'and imported, arc taken to the mints mid exchanged for coin en notes.

There are Kti.ll in existence, uncancelled, $31'j,681.01G of Uniteel States legal-tender notes. Theie notes were authorized a a war meaHure, made iiece-ssaiT bv the exigencies of the coiillu t in which tho United State wa then rngagei1. Tho preservation of the n ition' existence reipiired, in the judginent of Congress, an issue of lega1-teudr paper money. That it served well tho purpose for which it was created is not cpiestioneel, but the tniployment of the notes as pp.pi r money indeilnitelv, after the accomplishnnnt of tho o'jjt-ct fi r which they were provided, nas uot contemplated ly the frame ra of the law under which they were isnexl. These notes long since became liho any otlvr H-cuiiiary ob ligation of the Government -a debt to be paid, and. when paid, to lie cance l led a mere evi elcnce of an indebtedness no longer existing. I. therefore, re-post what wa said iu tho annual Message of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United States nfites, with the capaeity of legrd tender in private contracts, is a step tei bo taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, whijh should be accepteel as the iolicy and duty of the Gov ernment autl tho Interest and security of the people. At tho timo of the passage of tlie net now in force requiring the coin no of silver dollar, fixing their valuo and giving them legal-tender character, it wa believeel by many ot the sup porters ef the measure that tlie silver dollar, which it authorized, would speedily become, under tho operations of tlie law, of e quivalent valuo to the gold dollar. There wero other supporter of the bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability of thi result, nevertheless were willing to give tho proposed experiment a fair trial, with a viow to stop tho eoinace, if experience shonul prove that the silver dollar authorized by tho bill conunueel to be of less commercial value than tho standarel gold dollar. Tho coinage of t-ilver elollars, under the act referred to, began iu March, 178, and has been continuetd as required by the act. Tho average rate per month to tho present timo has been rj2,27C.4C2. Tho total amount ceinod pi )r to the 1st of NoVv-mbcr last was $72,M7, 750. Or this amiunt $ 17,081,4V) remiin in tho treasury, and only $25,7,2yi are in the hand of tne people. A constant effort has been made to keep tVs currency iu eircu lation. aud consi lerable excuse has been necessarily incuired for this purpose, but its return to tho treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the coutidont anticipation of tho friend of tho monsnro at tho time of its adoption, tho value of tho silver dollar, containing 412j grams of silver, has not in creased. During the year prior to tho passage of tho bill authorizing its coinage, tho market valuo of tho silver which it contained was frem 90 to 02 cents, as compared with tho standard geld elollar. During the last year tho average market valuo of the silver dollar has been 88 cent. It is obvious that tho Vgislation of tho last Congress in regard to silver, st far a it waa based on an anticipated rise in tho value of rilver a a result of that legislation; l'aH faib'd to proelucj the effect then predicted. The longer tho law remains in force, re quiring as it elocs the coinage of a nominal doll.tr, which, in reality, Is not . elollar, the greater becomes the danger that thi country will Is? forceni to ac cept a single mt tal a tho sole legal standard of value, in circulation, and thi a standard of Ics value than it pnrjxirt to be worth in the recognized money of tho world. Tee constitution of the UnUeel States, sound linncul principle, and our test interest, all require that the count rv should have as iU legal tender money both gold ami silver coin, of an intrinsij value, r.e bullion, eepiivalent to that which, upon its face-, it purports to possess. 'Ihej constitution, iu express terms, le-'e'gn'zes loth gold and til vera tho only true legal-tender money. To banish e ither of theso metals from our currency Ls to narrow and bm.t the circu lating medium ed exchange to the disparage ment of important interest. The United States prodi.ee more silver than uny other coun try, and is ehrectly interested m maintaining it us ono of tho two precious metal which lur nish the coinage ef tho we rid. It ill, in my jn igmeiit. contribute to this result if Congress will rejHal so much of existing legislation as n quire the com ipo of silver dollars, contain ing only 412 grains of silver, and in it stead will authorize the Secretnry of the Treasury to coin s.lver elollar of equivalent value as bull ion with gild elollir. 'Ibis will defraud no man, nnd wid bo in accordance! with familiar preceHlents Congress, on teveral occasions, has altered tlie ratio ef value I etween gold and silver, in order to establ tdi it nuire nearly in accordance with tho actual rati j of valuo be-twe-en the two metal. In finane i.il le gislation every measure in the direction ol greater fidelity iu tho discharge of pecuniary obligation has be en louud by e-xpe-rie-nce to diminish the rates of interest which debtor are ri quired to pay. and to increase the facility with winch money "on bo obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our ovi re-oent financial history shows bov surely n.oney le-e-ome's abundant whenever confide nce in tho ex act jh rfonnanco of monejid obligations is es tablished. Tne Secretary of War reports that the ex penditures of tbo War Department for tlie tis enl year ended June 30, 18X0, were $30,924, 778.03. Too appropriation for this di-pirt-m nt, for tho current fiscal year, amount to 41,W3,6)o.40. With respect to tho army, the Rocretcry in-eite-a atte ntiein to the fact that it strength i limiteel by stat'ite (Section 1,115, Ilevised Stat-ute-s) to not metre than 30.uo enlist el men, but that pr iviso ee)utaiiiel m appropriation till havo limited expenditure to tho enlistment of but 25,000. It is be-lieveel that lull legal ttrcngth is the) least j'Ossihlo feirco at which tlie piese-nt ore a nidation can Ihi maintained, havng in vie;w ellieieney, discipline anel ecoiMiiny. While tbo enlistment of this fence would add sauewhat tertlv? appropriation for pay of the army, tho saving niaeie in either resH-ct wend I be moro than an equivalent for thi additional outiav, ami tho t fikit-ncy of the army would bo largely inuood. Tho rapiel extension of tho railroad system west of the Mississippi river, and tho great ti le of s tt'ers which has flowed in upon new territory, impose on tho military an entro change of iKjliny. The maintenance of small posts tiling wagon and stage rente- of travel is no longer iiHi-essary. iYrmaneut qu'rur at points selected, it a mere tmiwUutid character than those heretofore constructed, will be required. Under exi-t ng laws, pr manent buildings cannot bo erected without the sanction of Angres, ami when sales of military sites and buildings have - been author ized, the moneys recoirod have reverted
