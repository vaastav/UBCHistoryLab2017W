The President’s message* is* occupied hugely with a /omul recapitulation of Ihe rendition of oar foreign affairs. It ex tytupaihy with the adoption of re* } ;;}>.scan institutions by France, and a de hto to avoid any intervention in the I'ihnco.Germnn conflict, save at the solicit* ntion of both parties, and in the interests of pence. It recommends that Congress :(_aic provision for tbe purchase, by -our outj government, of the Alabama claims, so that the nation may hold this issue in its own hands for fntnro adjustment. Tbe n commendation implies that the President thinks it wiser to bay np the claims on be* half of tbe nation, than it wonldbo to al low the British Government to pay them off without further trouble. In other voids, the President thinks this avery I r< tty quarrel as it stands. Those who believe that peace, except vhne war is absolutely unavoidable, is the h. wise, and economical policy of all i: uious will inquire why the nation shoold p> to the expense of paying off these ihiuis to prevent England from paying thnn, when she is ready and anxious to do ko. To tax onr own people to pay Bag land's debts, lest wc may lose a cause of tjuniTcl with her, which ahe is prepared to di-charge, and we are not prepared to en force. M-ems neither brave nor genertma. lu ti e same connection, the President (1 ■>«•;!» i-u tbe difficulties between onr fish i ni;« u nud the Canadians, with a minnte* i. of st dement which shows that they 1.-.-.M-occnpied a much larger share of his' ntteutou than of the conntxyV. Wo con f.«e do not see mnch to quarrel about ti:o fact that the Canadian authorities prohibit our fishermen from fishing within Ur. «■ miles of their shores. Tht-ir right to prevent them, under in i' ruutMLiil law. from fishing within three null > of the Canadian shores, even if it 1 .ul imt been expressly acknowledged by tn atr. is as clear ns their right to prevent tlu w from cutting timber on the shore. V.V .i„ubt not that, if a war with England j-ha’.l ever become convenient ornecessary, home stronger grounds than these will be available to base it on. \\ v think most readers will be surprised at the President's singular argument for the purchase of San Domingo. Had ho confined himself to the ample and digni find statement that he still maintained his j.inner opinions in favor of the acquisition of that island, the statement would have LbJ all the force that attaches to an Execu tive recommendation. Hut the President proceeds to argue that if we do not acquire San Domingo, Eu rope will build a free port and a great city on the Bay of Sanmna (as if that result ■ w ould not be as advantageous to us as its ' acquisition I) If we do purchase it, ho argut-H, the slaves will rush thither from tbt* o;Ler islands in such numbers as to 1,-aw no slavery in Cuba or Porto Bico; the national debt, which it will be very difficult to pay unless San Domingo is bought, will fade like the baseless fabric of j. vimud jf we buy San Domingo. In short, the San Domingo purchase, notwithstand ing its defeat last year, is still the pet iui :i-u:e of the President, and his recom mending it to the two houses of Congress, of the Senate in Executive Session, (bat Le prefers the plan of annex ing «Le i«lbud by joint resolution, instead ot a ratification of the treaty in the mode pret-ciibtd in the constitution. The Mibject of our depressed commerce v.**t engages the attention of the Prosl il-nt. We regret to observe that he fails i<> T'u.t-v; the recommendation of his special mo-age to Congress at the last session in fiivorvf admitting to American registry, f<>r iLc purposes of oar foreign trade, ves- S purchased abroad, la place of that r- couiim-udution, be suggests that our ship- I iug >bonld be encouraged by appropria tion-* from the National Treasury. He tuiuks (tint our foreign commerce is in Fuck it condition at present, that ** we will, iu the tutore. Lave to look more to the countri’S Houth of ns, and toCblnsand Japan, for its revival" —a suggestion, the tno.tcitig of which, we quite fail to com pU-Lrtld. Tfct? recommends legislation l .okiug to an early resumption of specie payment*. The wanner of bringing this ni.on', is not suggested, bat tbe recommen dation itself meets our hearty approval, tn*l 'kill, ve think, be favorably received J»y the country. Wlat is meant by revenue reform seems to a great puzzle to the President, and Lc goes on to tell several kinds of revenue reform that he Is opposed to. If it means repudiation of tbe national debt, he is op* loosed to that. If it means tbe abolition of Custom Uunses, and the collection of all tuxes by direct assessment upon the peo ple, Lc-is opposed to that- Since revenue r. form bus not, so far ns ho is advised, l ien defined by any of its advocates, he I vlievo that a tariff for revenue tsneces fury. Tbo concluding sentence of this lucid chapter on revenue reform* will piobfably l>e construed as committing the pie-idunt to a protective tariff. He says: ••Mictx a win,m! rastt actslaencowajj?- im-ti«(tii irt! p txiurers, anorrts employment to lai*>rat Itvuc Wbct-s, in ceniran to the pauper ln'-ir oi ihf o.<i World, soil also in the develop ment of home ictourcea.” This is an expression of individual opin ion as to how a protective tariff operates— from which opinion we wholly dissent. While it is sufficiently . indicative of the hind of influence by which the President ] i.s surrounded—tbe same which procured tbe removal of Secretary Cox —It is,-prob ably. not so strong as the high tariff ring expected. We infer that the meaning of revenue reform is clearer to the Executive mind than he is willing to admit, and that its progress in the country has not wholly escaped Lis attention. TLe expenses of the army and navy r Low a commendable redaction daring the pb.->t year. TLe President recommends, Lou ever, a more liberal policy toward the navy in respect of the construction of new vessels, believing that such a policy v til bo more economical in the end than the present policy of repairing old ones. Civil service reform receives such warm ill proval from the President, that Secre tary On must be highly gratified in his place of retirement. The country, how ever. is mure concerned with the thing itx-lf, than with the incentives which bring the President to his present convic tions. lie recommends that the tenure of r.Il officers not requiring the appointment of the President and concurrence of the IfvXjidc be fixed by law, and that the man ner «f making such appointments be radi cally changed. This is, perhaps, the moat - important and judicious recommendation in the message, and it gives promise of home turly and efficacious purification of the civil service- There is nothing which tbe country will watch.more closely and at- Iciisivtlv than this reform. Thr public land question is discussed at ■; yrxt- length in the message, andthocon ' elusion is reached that no more lands ought to be given away to railroads, nml ~ihcr corporations, “unless the pro jected work is of acknowledged national iii;p--n«nco." This seems to leave open a pi- ttv wide door, but the argument in the ji.i ssvg»; i* adverse to the land-donating p .bey. and is, therefore, a step in the right direction. Id conclusion, the President .sums up 4 • the policy ot the administration,” which, Lc savs. consists in the rigid enforcement of 2Lc laws, faithful collection of the taxes, ; economy in disbursements,* reduction of * laics so far ts practicable, prompt pay out of the public debt, etc.—a platform ! to which few objections esa be made, and vhich nearly everybody will desire to see , carried ont.

COBOEEBS ABD THE CENSUS. | • The present Congress has a doty to par-' ! form, which it cannot evade without doing | rsnkinjnstlce to the country. The oonsbtu-' tion provides for an enumerationpf the io< habitants every ten jean, and for aeorre^:. : ; apportionment /of repreaenUtiionll ! The oensuahasbeen completed,and the con- • qtitutional right to representation,. accord-’ ibg'to that enumeration, has accrued. Shall that apportionment Uioeffoct in December,' 1871, or (hall it be postponed until Decem ber, 1873 ? The only object! onthat has ever been urged to making this apportion ment at the session following the enumera j tion, and making it applicable to the next | Congress, has been that the actual figures have not been known -in time.' But this objection cannot now be urged, 'Aie old difficulty of ascertaining the exact number, of slaves in order to deduct , two-, fifths from the number of the representative population, exists on longer. The whole population is hereafter to be represented, and the totals in each State will all* be known by the Ist of January. There have been important geo graphical changes in the population, and the refusal at this time to reapportion the representation ean'onlybe attributed to the desire cm the part of the minority to perpetuate their ascendancy for two years beyond the constitutional limit. It is urged that thVßepresentatives for the next Congress have already been elected I In a majority of the States, but this j in no way prevents a proper apportion ment. If the present number of Repre sentatives be retained, these several States will be entitled to a less number of Repre j sentativea in the next Congress. But there is no desire to reduce the number of Rep resentatives below that to which the sev eral States are now entitled. On the con trary, public opinion has generally ap proved tho policy of increasing the num bers of the House of Representatives. An examination of the census will show that, d>y fixing the whole number of Represent atives at 275 or 280, no State will suffer any loss in the number of its Representa tives. Those States whoso population has proportionately increased will absorb the additional members. In this way, Congress, by fixing the. number at 275, will in no wise interfere with the number of Representatives already eleot td; and it can provide in tho same bill, that in Stales whore additional Representa tives are allowed, they may be elected by general ticket in November next. There is no constitutional or other objection to tbia measure, and we hope that the West will present an undivided front in favor of having the whole country represented in the next Congress, according to the enu meration. of 1870. To postpone that ap portionment will bo a most unjustifiable denial of justice and of clear constitutional right. A 

MAGNIFICENT JOB. The Slate of Indiana is threatened with one of the most enormous jobs that has been attempted to be pat through for many years. The history of the case is briefly as follows: In ISUS-SO, and later, Indiana was a victim of the prevailing malady of internal improvements. Among other works undertaken was the Wabash and Erie Canal, to construct which the State issued l>onds to the amount of $10,000,000. There were other State bonds out standing, and, in 1815, the State Hank under the load, end stopped paymant of interest. These bonds bore interest, some at C, and others at 7 per cent. The canal was not completed, and in those days it was considered that if it could be finished it would rapidly pay for itself. But the means and credit of the State were exhausted. After a long nego tiation between the State and its creditors, it was agreed that one-half the outstanding bonds should be funded in 5 pet cent bonds, and one-half in canal scrip, bearing 5 per cent interest, and that the accrued and un paid interest should bo funded in bonds nnd scrip, bearing 2J per cent interest. Under this agreement the State conveyed the canal entire to the Trustees appointed by the holders of the canal scrip, aud also certain lands in Georgia, and several town lots in Brooklyn, N. Y. The State assumed to pay the bonds, and was released by its creditors from all responsibility for the canal scrip, tho canal Itself being In satis faction of that half of the debt represented bv the canal scrip. In other words, the State gave far onc-holf its debt, the canal und other property. The now holders of the canal, however, never completed the work, and not a dollar has over been paid on either principal or interest of the scrip. The original debt was $14,000,000, one* half of which was paid by “.per cent bond*, idl of which the Strte has since paid off, principal and interest. The holders of the I other half cf the debt accepted the canal ns a 1 better seenrity than tbe State bonds, and, as it bas turned ont, made abad bargain. This $7,000,000, with fifteen years accumulated interest, now amounts to between §12,000,- (too und §10,000,000. It seems that tbe State, in making the bargain, pledged itself to do all acts tending to aid the same, and to avoid all acts calculated to impair its business, diminish its tolls, or render it loss profitable. It is now claimed that, several years later, the States by general act, permitted and encouraged a system of railways which hare completely ah* sortad the transportation that might have otherwise been done on the canal. The claim now presented is, that the State shall take hack the canal and pay this accumulated debt and interest The danger which threatens tho State of Indiana is that the Legislature will yield to the blandishments of the lobby holding sixteen millions of dollars worth of scrip, now utterly worthless, hut to which the Legislature can give a value of 100 cents on. the dollar. The power of this lobby has been felt in the State at several State elections. There seems to ho a general understanding that the Democratic party, in return for material aid, is to pass the Uw taking back the canal, and assuming the debt. The Legislature-elect is Demo cratic, and the holders of tho canal scrip propose, • this winter, to make a demonstration in force at Indianapolis to Induce tho State Government to repur chase the canal. If they can do this, they will realize sixteen millions of dollars from the people of Indiana, and can well afford to pay one-half that sum for tbe legisla tion. Tho men in the Slate who advocate this job, we suppose, intend to extenuate tho offence by proposing to club together with tbe Fox and Wisconsin Biyer im provement and the Kew Fork canals, and induce the Government of the United Slates to purchase the canal, and reimburse tbe State of Indiana for its loss by this corrupt legislation. THE PROGRESS OF CHICAGO. The number of first-elasa business blocks now being erected in Chicago is greater than ever before. Very many of them are moro than first-class; they are palatial. They do not resemble what, twenty years ago, would have been thought, in any East ern city, the composed and Qnaker-Uke ttyle appropriate in temples of trade and | commerce, of mere ledgers and invoices, , Ponderous and enduring In structure, and yet artistic and air; in architectural design and finish, they would then have been thought more fit and appropriate for the town palaces of European nobles than for the places of business of Chicago mer chants, brokers, and forwarders. Flocks of the kind described are-filling up the available interstices in the First and Second Wards, and evince p plain inten tion to occupy State, Dearborn* Clark, and LaSalle streets, from Monroe street south ward, as rapidly as the utmost energies of our architects and bonders can put them up. Well-informed architects already assure ns that the year 1871 will bo the most active building season Chicago has ever known. Of course, the conservatives doubt whether fashionable and expensive tenants can be found for all these build ings, and itis very generally felt that the supply of hotel buildings and offices is, at 'present, in excess of the demand. Should a direct foreign trade, however, spring up | under the Fort-ot-Enlry bill, Una fact alone will create a saffi. dent additional demand to ex haust out present supply. Besides, for many branches of manufacture, we need larger buildings and cheaper rents than have heretofore been offered. As thp ten ants of the older and plainer buildings' move out into the newer and more orna mental, their former places of business would be available for those branches of manufacturing in which last .re quired, and Ike profits an closer than in The great obstacle* at present to tbo introduction more extensive* ly of manufactures arc high rateTof renU, of interest, and ‘of. labor, butohieflytho' deficiency of buildings; and ,"of 11 braking capital. We have the ultimate jresoaroes, iia.: The fuel, the demand,.^he'labor, the pres, and the means ot transportation. Bat the immediate resources, the capi pJ, ... rents,... .and . labor are four pr fire,; _or ten,. or twenty per cent, higher Ih6oth.ey are EiStward— jost. enough to. overbalance the-cost of freights'from the East here. The present period will go for toward solving this problem. -* ■ I Meanwhile, in oursuburbs, residences of amediam character, arc going np every where, and in some localities the same de gree of art and-style is' displayed as in the erection of oar larger business blocks. The tendency to suburban life, the trick of living ■ the doable town-aud-oountxy life which the leading business men of every great metropolis sooner orlater learn, is ; rapidly spreading here. Evanston is becoming so compact that one is only less in the country there than at Cottage Grove or Lincoln Park. Yet it is 'still grow ing with constantly accelerating rapidity. -Oakwood, Hyde Park, Riverside, Harlem, Luke Forest, and Highland Park are being changed, as by the hand of magic, into suburban retreats not less attractive than the scores of beantifnl villages that sur round New York. and Boston, London, Paris, and Berlin. It was formerly said that Chicago was so located on a dead level of prairie that it canid never have any attractive suburbs. The South Park and Bivereide will ulti mately refute this on the south, while High-, land Park and Lake Forest already reverse it on the north. Looking oat upon the lake from a height of 100 feet or more, and broken by dark and heavily wooded ravines which are capable of every touch of rorai ornamentation, we can conceive of no rite for the most elegant country villas more at tractive than those already ocenpied at Lake Forest, or which are rapidly being taken up at Highland Park. In short, at no former period of oar history was so much first-class residence and business property being created as now. Oar cap!- talists and business men seem to plan and build in full faith that Chicago must attain hersizhondrei thousand population with in the coming tenyears. We believe those calculations which are the boldest in this respect are tbo soundest and safest. In (be recent Republican State Conven tion tboro was a delegate from Rock Island who was in favor of a protective tariff. He was a member of tbe Committee on Reso lutions, upon which committee there were twelve other members. This Rock Island member (and we wish to speak of him with entire respect, for he condnctod himself as a gentleman), was exceedingly anxious to have n protective tariff plank pnt in the plat form, but could not get a single member to agree with him. Failing in this, bo wanted to get a resolution adopted that would be susceptible of two constructions, and in this be could not get a single member to agree with him. Finally, the sixth resolu tion, as it appears in the platform, was adopted by tbe affirmative votes of all tbe members of the committee, except the gen tleman from Rock Island, and one other, who, being the temporary presiding officer of the convention, was not present at the meeting of the committee, and did not vote at all. And now the Bock Island Union under takes to say that the sixth resolution does not represent the sentiments of the Be* publicans of Illinois! Wo undertake to say that there will never bo a Bepublican State Convention in' Illinois that will take any lower ground on the tariff question than the sixth resolution takes—none that will come one hair's breadth nearer to en dorsing what is falsely called protection. We undertake to say that, without that resolution, or something of the same tenor, Mr. Hawley would have been defeated in the Bock Island district by from three to five thousand majority, and the Bepublican State ticket would have been defeated by fifty thousand. It would have been just ns easy for the Bepublican party in Illinois to have crumbled to pieces this year on that issue as for the party in Missouri. That it did not so crumble, is due to the fact that it declared, in unmistakable terms, its opposition to tho policy of taxing one man for the benefit of another. Tho Bock Island Union will not live long enough to ace the Bepublican party of Dlinols take any different ground, or adopt a platform less decided. Governor Smith, of Alabama, bas pub lished a card, in which be seeks to justify his forcible retention of the Executive office. He says be was aware that, if the vote ot the State for Governor was officially canvassed, his opponent would be declared elected, and he thinks he was right in su ing out an injunction against counting the vote. He holds the office, and puts tho Governor-elect to the task of ejecting him. This may bo technically very smart, but the proceeding goes far to show that those Republicans who voted against and de feated Smith had a very proper apprecia tion of the man. The court which granted the injunction ought to revoke it, and thus enable the Legislature to nd tho State of •he usurping Executive. The Chicago Republican, whose position on the tariff question has been rather mixed of late, now defines it as follows: »• To all of which we answer, that of free trade weknow of but one species, and that is the tree trade with which neither protect ton nor dmet taxation ta compatible. Not only so, bat we nave t o synipatdy with any plan that (alts shut of this; asd look upon the entire home or i nridmiat pro* tfctxmu.t», tarif reformuU, and intirret taxatxm. i«t>, as so many ocluslunist?, who rlifer with Tub Triscnb or It id decree, with the disadvantage of being more illogical.” Wherefrom it doth appear that our neighbor does noi believe in either direct or indirect taxation, in free trade, in tariff reform, or in incidental protection. It is needless to inquire what it does believe in, os there is no possible ground left for it upon the revenue question. TQB

TUB abut. Under tbe act of Congicsi of July is. iSTO, the army has gradually been reduced, so tuat on the Istof Jacuarv, 1371, me somber of com missioned officer*and men win not exceed the number cen emplatedby that law. Toe depart ment building is an oMsanctore, not tire-proof, acd entirely mam quite la dimension* to our pres ent wants. Many tncussnos of dollars are sow paid annually for rent of private buildings to ac commodate me various bureaus ot the depart ment. I rccomtmnd an appropriation for a new War Department bmMinv, halted to the present aud growing watt** ox me nation. The report of toe Stems'y of War shows a very satisfactory rcdociton in the expenses of the army for tbe la-t flees! year. Fur detai s, you are referred to his accompanying u-peru TUB SAW. The expensea of the navy (or the whole of the last year, from December 1,1939, the date of the last report, are less than $19,000,000, or absnt jl.i oo.oco less man they wtuo me previous year. Tbe expenses since the commeacemeot of this tscal year. f. since July 1, show, for tbe live months, a decrease of avcrtt,4oo,nou from those of the corresponding months of lastyetr. The estimates for tbe current year were $£3,209,673.03. Jear are 120,6i3,317, with uecesaary pctuianeut im pnvements. These esum&tes ue made closely for tne maintenance of the naval establishment, as it now u without much In the nature ot perma nent improvement, Tne appropriation made for the last and current years were evidently intended by Coogres*, and are sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing br the re pairing and reflttina of our old snips. This policy most, of course, gradually bnt surely destroy tbe tavy, and it Utn itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued thcnecesdty for more repairs in ships and navy yards becomes more imperative ana more cosily, aadoar current ex* penies are annnslly increased for the mere re pair ol ships, many of wnicn most soon become unsafe ana useless. I hope, daring the present eesstCD of Congress, to be able to submit to It a plan by which naval vessels can be bout and re pairs made with great saving upon tne present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a government which represents a country with over five thousand miles of coast line on bothv> C£fto *' exclusive of Alaira. acd contalhg forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every nature wltn aim st ' every foreign conotir, to rest with such Inade quate means ot enforcing any foreign policy eitfler ot protection ot rtdieit. St par&ted by the ocean ftom the nations of the Eastern Continent, onr navy Is onr only means of direct protection to oar citizens abroad or for the enforcement of any for ; eiga policy. TOT

The acquisition ol Alaska, the estabUsntnent- of inte'iorponaof entry for the accommodation ot business by railways and steamers on the Noitb ern irouUer, add materially to the expenses of collecting and guard* log the revenue. I. therefore, respectfully recommend an increase of toe permanent appro priation tor collecting tbe revenue for customs to the sum of 52.600.kd for each half year from and after the 30ih day of sane, 1370. At several of tbe important porta there are two appraisers, whose powers are equal.
