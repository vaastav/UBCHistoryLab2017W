Wilsen Pleased at What He Says en the Tariff Question. Congressman Dnlzell fcnys tlie President's Ylevrs en tlie Tariff Are In Line With, These Hitherto Laid Uewn by Mint Itccil Says It U Disappointing;. Washington, Dec. 4. Some of the views of the prominent legislators en the- president's message are set out as follews: Mr. Wilsen (dem., W. Va.), chairman of the ways and means com mittee, said: "I am especially pleased nt what he says en the tariff ques tion. " "Able and appropriate," was the comment of Mr. McCreary (dem., Ky.), chairman of the heubc foreign affairs. "It contains much valuable luferma- tien." Dr. Dalzell (rep., Pa.): "Tlie presl dent's views en the tariff seem te be en the line heretofore laid down by him. He thinks a protective tariff invariably ' increases the cost te the consumer. Vi'q ' knew that such is net the case under the interpretation e the McKinley law, a fact tltat would have- been apparent te the president ii he had seen fit te read testimony taken before the ways and means com mittee. Of course, as was te be ex pected, he is still after the markets ei the world, a very dcsirable thin? il present conditions continue, becnuse thcre won't be any market at home or any money te spend in them. The most astonishing- thin? in the message is that an income tax has been agreed upon. That is news. I hippen te be a member of the minority of the ways and means committee, but it is the first time I knew such a tax has been agreed upon, although I have inquired dili gently about it every day. Se far as the tariff is concerned the message ii net a valuable contribution te the dis cussion. What he says is net new, al though he s-vys semethings that are strange." Mr. Bynum, (Ind.) "It is a very con cise but clear statement of the attitude of the questions which congress will be called en te consider." Mr. Springer, (dem., 111.) "The ines- ' sage is aencise and able exposition of the present condition of the country " Mr. Heed: "It ib exceedingly disap pointing both in matter and manner. It is largely made up of a wearisome resume of the reports of his secretaries which hive have hardly improved by condensation. One the Hawaii question we were left as much in the dark as ever, and must await the uews of the next steamer just s we have been for a long time. The president's message which relates te the tariff is most surprising Itasser vatcs tl at the house committee in charge of tin subject had formulated plans and devised methods of taxation which, us a member of the committee, I have never even heard proposed. It is a rather unusual sensation te learn of the tieeds of the committee net in the committee room, but from the president of the Tnitcd States. Sena Sena eor Sherman and Senater D. 15. Hill re fused te express opinions, while Sena Sena eor Murphy, of New Yerk, said: "It is Vv an able document." Negotiating for tliu Icll.mt. Bnnxi.v, Dec. !.
