CA fi ! fek itfV f fft J t P! '5 i ii it $ V UrtVjri "$& WIRE PULLING Has Already Commenced by the Lending Republican Ciuidl- tiutcs fur Governor. Jadtt Oro. K. Nash and Harry Uaugh- erij in itie Lead Willi a Number of Dal k Horses Close In llie Bear. Columbus, 0 , December 6, 1S98. The nndidacy of Judge George K. Nash, if this city, was formally launch ed laet nturday in a column article in the Ol.io Mate Journal, with a cut of the distiiitfiiialiud gentleman at the top of the column, and next to pure reading matter The article gave a complete Motnrv r his life. Particular stress is placed upon the service he has render ed Vhr i. mnti-i nnd his narty. ISo one will d-nv that Judgt) Nash is a good citi- yon? 11.1 ont will disnute that ho has been a good Republican ; no one will doubt that he was a brave, good soldier, and yet his war record in the Journal article if summed up in these fi'W words: "He served for a time in the One Hnn dred aud Fiiiieth Ohio regiment during the late war (by which, of couiom, ie meant the late Civil War), latterly going to Greene county, where he taught school." The article then continues: "He came home from the war a sick, puny young man, with less than $25 in money in his pocket, and nothing in the way of money or influential friends to recommend him. In a career of a third of a century, Judge Nash Btands fans peur el tan reproche." I don't know what the latter half of the closiDg sen tence means, but, appearing in one of the most pronounced Hanna papers in' the state, I take it that it is something complimentary, or, at least, intended to be such. At any rate, I am perfetly willing to agree with the State Journal in all that it has said. Judge Nash it not nnlike other men. He has had his ups and downs. The only difference be tween men in this respect is that some have their troubles in their early age, others in middle life and still others in declining years. Judge Nash belongs to the former, the sunshine of whose lives from the time of their first triumph have been obscured by very few clouds. Chairman Daagherty, with his face still flushed by the recent Republican victory in Ohio, finds that he has a greater con" tract on bis hands than that assumed when at Senator Hanna's request he took charge of the Ohio campaign. He belongs to the middle class. General Grosvenor belongs to the latter clats, who have to combat these difficulties in their declining years, politically speaking at least, and while he strokes his long grey beard as impetuously as a Kansas Populist, he neither appears ag gressive or enters a word of complaint He is too foxy to do either. Groeveno has a great deal of cunning when he has an office in sight,and talks too much when he has had no axe of his own to grind. Judge Nash's life has not been one of uninterrupted sunshine. Fortune has favored him a great deal in times past He has occupied several important,, po sitions of trust in Ohio, and been faithful to each and every one, bat for several years he has been anxious to secure the nomination for Governor, only to be disappointed. He came the nearest reaching the goal of his ambition at Zaneaville in 1895, Bat the compact entered into at that time naming Bush nell for Governor, Foraker for Senator and McKinley for President, compelled him to step aside and bide his time. It is understood that Senator Hanna and his friends at that time promised Judge Nash their support in the present con test, bat the friends of Chairman Daagh erty are patting forth a similar claim. Grant 0. Gillette, the Kansas cattle plunger, whose exploits are now being aired by the newspapers, so far forgot himself as to mortgage the same herd of cattle to two diflerent people, bat thev were to fall due at different times, and if Gillette had not run out of funds with which to bay fe"d the public would never have been the wiser, and every body would Lave been hsppy and con tented. Daugherty and Nash have both become hungry for office at one and the the came time, and while Senator Hanna is not short on cash, he is short on fod der, and his farmer friends refuse to tome to his rescue. Senator Hanna is seeking to unite the discordant elements in his own household on Judge Nash, but the friends of Chairman Daugherty are loyal, and a most serious division in the Hanna ranks presents itself. Who would have supposed for a moment that Secretary of State Kinney, State Dairy and Food Commissioner Blackburn, Cyras Huhng, Chairman of the State Central Committee, Josiah B Allen, Clerk of the Supreme Court, General Charles H. Grosvenor and other Repub licaos of equal prominence, would have taken issue with Senator Hanna in the selection of a candidate for the Gov WBonhiB Most of these gentlemen are for Daagheity first, last and all the time. Am a saatUc si faet I nave been informed .bsitseroUrylOansy aad Mxr Haling direct promise of support was ever given Air. Daugherty. The conversation is paid to have taken place over the long distance telephone, and the misunder standing is attributed to that fact. One might infer from the classification of Congressman Grosvenor with Secretary of State Kinney and the other gentle men named above that he was for Chair man Daagherty for Governor. He is for the "nominee of the convention," and is particularly anxious that the candU didate should be Grosvenor. The friends of Judge Nash and Chair man Daugherty have been scurrying the state during the past week in an effort to secure pledgee of support for their re epective candidates from influential Re publicans, Senator Hanna, previous to his departure from Washington, was visited at his Cleveland home by Mr. John R. Malloy and Mr. Howard W. Mannington, the former making the trip in the interest of Judge George K. Nash and the latter tn behalf of Chairman Daugherty. Mr. Malloyrefuses to dis close what Hanna said to him,but to Mr. Mannington, who presented the claims of the head of the present party organiza tion in Otio, the Senator is said to have been non-committal. The result of Mr Mannington's visit to Cleveland was not satisfactory to Mr. Daugherty and his friends. In other words, Senator Han na's evasion of the main question was disappointing to them. There was no uews in the Senator's statement made to Mr. Mannington that Daugherty is a devil of a good fellew. Mannington knew that aud this was one of the rea sonB urged why the Senator should sup port him for Governor. All efforts to get the Senator to make any positive statements were unavailing so far as Mr. Mannington was concerned, but Mr. Malloy, as the representative of Judge Nash, is said to have returned to his chief with assurances of support from the Senator and his friends so far as he could whip them into line. He is said. to have explained to Mr. Malloy, how ever, that he was having trouble along this line and where least expected. Secretary of State Kinney went to Cin cinnati to consult with George B. Cox with reference to Chairman Daugherty's candidacy. Mr. Cox was non committal but agreed to "think the matter over." Other emissaries are said to have been dispatched to other sections of the state. Interest in the gubernatorial situation is increasing, and by springtime it will be something awful to contemplate. Sen ator Henna is at a safe distance in Wash ington. The railroads are closing up accounts for the year and no more free transportation will be issued for 30 or 60 days at least, so that the perspiring and aspiring politicians will not be able to ranch him for that length of time. These people have all been so busy that not a single one has read the President's mes sage. They are thinking only of one thing, and that is the Gjvernorship of Ohio. Senator Hanna is reported to have that the Republicans of Ohio most get together, and his friends (are assert ing that those who are opposing Judge Nash are antagonizing the administra tion. In view of this sort'of talk there is only one way for the 'Republicans to get together, and that is to follow Han na's lead. Mr. Daugherty's friends will decline to do this, and the indications at this time are that it will be war to the knife. The Toledo Commercial had a column editorial on the gubernatorial situation a day or two ago, and, spoke pleasantly of Nash and Daugherty both, bat dis posed of Grosvenor with the single state ment that he would be more useful In Congress. The Commercial, if anything, shows a preference for Chairman Daagh erty. It also mentions Lieutenant Gov ernor Jones and Judge Day. Lieuten ant Governor Jones Is an active candi date for the nomination, but is conduct ing his campaign in his own way. There is some doubt regarding Judge Day's re ported candidacy. The creation of an Ohio Peace commission in the interest of party harmony may yet become im portant, and Judge Day's experience with the Spaniards would make him valuable as a member ofthat commk sion. He should be held in reserve by the authorities of Washington. There is much bitterness of feeling among tbe friends of the various gubernatorial can didates, a ad to add to the discomfort of some of them, with blizzards raging on the coasts and in the interior, Senator Hanna, in a published interview, an nounces that no more Ohio men will be appointed to office. He says that they have had all that they are entitled to,' itnd should rest contented. '2Those 'who have been nicely fixed can do so, but this sort of an argument will not satisfy those who are still tramplikgjthe streets. This is a bad state of affairs, to be sure, but it is to be hoped that all difficulties will be settled without serious blood shed or rupture in the party. Harmony is the thing desired, and it should be had at any price. Bquibbs. Superior Articles. CiiauroTHK, O., December 9, 1898. Mrs. John A.

From Onr Begalar OorrMpondent.) Washington, D, O., Dec, 9, 1898. President McKinley by the wise omissions from his annual message to Congress has greviously disappointed the Democrats. That is why the whole menagerie ie snarling. They thousht. or had persuaded 'themselves that they thought, the President would announce hide bound, policy towards the Phil ippines in advance ol the actual pos session of those islands by the Vf. 8., but tbe f resident Isn't that sort of a states man. Ha doesn't make ap hk miad upon any subject -blind folded, least of all upon such an Important one as the future of 8,000,000 helpless people. He has delivered them from the evils of Spanish rule, and will give them mili tary government that will be far better than any government they have ever known. That Is, far enough to go for some time to -come.. He will know more about the subject before recom mending the next step. There are oth er ombsions from the message that are equally wise, and they are equally as nagging to ' the Dsmocracts, who have no other hope for future success than the mistakes they expect the Bepubli cans to make. President McKinley pos sesses the faculty of knowing what not to say as well as what to say. That is one reason his admiatration has been such a success. Fighting over empty honors is an old Democratic specialty. So the wrangling between Bailey and anti-Bailey Demo crats as to who shall lead the Demo crats in the next House is no innova tion. Bailey leads some of tbe Demo crate in tbe present House, and claims the right by reason of bis having re ceived the Democratic caucus nomina tion for Speaker, to Jead them'all. Not withstanding tbe trouble it haa brought him, he wants to hold the same job in tbe next House; hence the present wrangling. Senator Vest has offered a resolution declaring that this government has no constitutional right to acquire or govern colonies, and given notice of his inten tion to make a speech on the resolution. The resolution to clearly intended as a 'feeler" of tbe pablio aa well as the Senate; to ascertain bow a partisan Demeeratle flftht om wpanefoii wonld be received, SomaJDesaosraUe Seaa tees will follow Vest, bt ieetor Mar, i. f.
