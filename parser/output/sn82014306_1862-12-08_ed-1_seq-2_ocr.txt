WEEKLY SENTINEL. "MONDAY. DECEMBER 8. Ureriurt; for Peace. We publish this week a letter from the Washington correspondent of the New Tork 7 Vtonac, tb substance of which wu telegraphed or er the country a few days ago. detailing an overture for peace, which, it is stated by the tame authority, had its origin with the rebel author ijes at Richmond Febxando Wood, in a re cent speech in New York, stated in effect that he lied received overture from leading men iu the iiouth proposing terms of reunion. This infor mation, coming from different and opposite nourees. politically, leads us to think, iu the ai g;i e - Hypochondriac in the play, that 'there may be something in it." The propo sitions fur peace, as stated by the correspondent lof the Trienae, have prooaoly the partisan ex ig geration that we must expect from the sources through which thev come, but if it h is been inti mated by the leaders of the rebellion, or prom inent citizens of the South, that the exhausting war in which we are engaged can be terminated, and a reunion under the old Government brought about, it is certainly worthy of consideration by the Federal authorities. If the restoration of the National authority over the so called Confederate States the mainten ance of the Constitution as it is and the Union aa it was-S.r the objects for which the w r is prose cuted, f Administration should not be unwilling to rar overtures from those o rcboHfN for .'r accom, isbaaeut of these end upu an en do: U0 bas s. The President in his Inaugural state.' V war should ensue from the d iticulties then existing a sentiment which he reiterates in his last message that friendly terms of inter course must become a matter of discussion and settlement. These ure his words: "Suppose you go to war, you cannot äght al ways; aud when, after much loss on both sides, and no . mi on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upou you." The contingencies anticipated by the President have occurred. For a rear and a half the coun try has been engaged in a terrible civil war, with much loss on both titles a waste of a vast amount of treasure and Mood. We cannot tight always The longer the contest the more exhausting will be its results to both sections of the country. If now we can secure an honorable peace an hon orable and lasting settlement of the terms which shall govern our future intercourse, it will be wise statesmanship to embrace the opportunity. Aud the people will hold those iu power to a tearful reckoning if thev fail to do so. We are not discussing the terms of settlement, but we lake it tor granted that they will be such as will prove advantageous to all sections, aud by such a policy rivet the bonds of Union more strongly together than ever. But suppose that these overtures, as the Trib une correspondent suggests, are only stragetical that the object of them is to gain a diplomatic advantage which will secure to the Confederates the sympathy and perhaps material aid from those nations who are pecuniarily interested in having this struggle cease, will it not be wise to entertain them? A refusal on our part to listen to terms ot settlement thty would certainly profit by The rebel leaders could make the re jection the foundation of an appeal tor the recog nition of tiieir claims to an independent nation ality, which foreign Governments, under such circumstances, would be disposed to regard. Not only recognition, but intervention, would proba bly follow a refusal on our part to listen to pro posals for an adjustment of sectional differences. But the Tribune correspondent intimates that the Administration will depend upou the "havoc" which will accompany our armies as the surest means of crushing out the rebellion. Will not a war of devastation, of ruthless plunder aud slaughter, excite the sympathy of every Christian nation in behalf of the sufferers? To such a warfare the words of Mr. Lixoour, in his last message, will forcibly apply : "Fellow citizens, we cannot escape ' history . We of this Congress will be remembered in spite of ourselves." Aud history will remember them, if thev "Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of wart " We hope that those in authority will let the Dogmas of the quiet past," which have ptoveu adequate to the government of the country, both in sunshine and in storm, rule now, and the same Union which prospered us in so wonderful a de gree, if restored, will again produce and developc equal progress and prosperity. In this conn jction we reproduce an article from the New Albany Ledger upon "our difficulties,' the writer of which, that print says, "is one among our most respected, responsible and loyal citizens," aud "'a hose suggestions are worthy the consider! tion of the people ol the North:" It is knowu to us all that there is a wide spread difficulty in our laud; a difficulty invoiviug the whole population of our country. Iu what man Oer shall it be settled so as to be most enduring in its principle atxi satisfactory to onr people, is a question deeply felt by those who would like the smiles of peace I-, beam upou our country once again. Shall it be by arms alone? Shall the coun ry still l-e drenched in blood, and our hearth stones be made desolate by the slain of dear and devoted ones? Shall there be no other arbiter bat the sword? Shall the North aud South rush on in madness until our glorious old country is ru ined in the conflict of armies? Or shall reason, judgment, und sound practical sense govern us iu the future? It is not necessary in the present writing to discuss the wrung of the Sjuth in leaving a Union the best ever yet devised by statesmen. We all knnw it was a great wrong on her part, and may we not hope that many, v-ry many of her deluded population have felt it to their sor row No. our object is to inquire ii there is not yet some chance of healing the divisions that afflict us by a peaceable arbitration of the matters at variance We cannot war always. There will be a time when it will end. All conflicts hare an end. And why not bring this to a termination, while yet we have enough of energy and healthful vi talilv left to throw off the hesvv load that seems www " to be pressing us down Wheu two or more men, partners in the great business of life, have be come entangled in difficulties, can they best settle their disputes by lighting, and continuing to fight, or are they more easily and satisfactorily terminated by a friendly meeting of the parties to talk and reason over the matter in contro any? Does not the history of man prove that in ninety -nine cases in one hundred all nisunder Undings can be better udjusted in that maimer than by a resort to violent and passionate means? Now, Government is an aggregate of insiivid nals, and the question comes up whether the difficulties that now cor ii on us cannot be more easily adjusted by a friendly talk on the part of those representing the Government and a sinvlar representation on the part of the South. I think some headway might be mails in seeing the end of our troubles in this way. But I am met by some passionate per-on who says, "it will do no good to propose a talk." "The country is too much exasperated to talk." To soch I would say it could do no harm to try. It would be doing Ood service, and besides no one can hardly tell what they c u. accomplish until iu effort h HJ been made Further, it would be a proposition from the stronger to a weaker power, which al ways looks manly aud magnanimous before the world, and even it should be rejected or spurned by the leaders of the South, we would have a proud satisfaction in our own bosom i he Christian world would applaud the act, and it would embolden the Union men of the Sooth to talk aloud agaiust the tyrant who would rofaoo to entertain in their behalf, and in behalf of the whole people of the South, so magnam ssous a proposition, coming from the constituted authorities of the Government. I do not propose the particular manner iu which we shall meet the itativea of the South. I leave that to to devise; but feeling seriously im willi the idea that this country will never be nnitad by war alone, I hare thrown together the lew thoughts above, thinking it might bave its influence, though small, in impressing upon the people of owr country that the "paths of part are sweet, and all her ways are pleasant. Tate Hesaage. Ere this, a majority of the people have read the annual message ot Mi Lin. ol.n and formed their conclusions upon his representations of the state of the Union, and the measures he recom mends to the consideration of Congress and the country as necessary and expedient It is an ex traordinary document, and throughout it is emi nently cbractcristic of the man. It contains but little information of the statt of the Union, but is devoted almost entirely with presenting the schemes of compulsory emancipation and negro colonisation which he suggested to Congress t its last session. We give credit to the President (or sincerity and earnestness in the plans he pro poses for the suppression ot the rebellion and for restoring peace and the national authority, but it j is the sincerity ot fanaticism. Who, after pe rusing the message of Mr. Lincolx, will be ablo to comprehend the coudition of public affairs and the pre-ent situation of the country? Such in formation from the President is what the people most desired at the present time. But the mes sage of the President is as impracticable and as uustatesmatilike as has been his administration of the Government. If he had applied the dog mas, the settled principles, of the quiet past in his conduct of public affairs from the beginning, he would have found them fully adequate to the settlement of the difficulties which have en com passed the nation since his advent into power. The President subordinates ail considerations of public policy to the one idea which has pos sessed him compensatory emancipation and the colonization of " free Americans of African descent' That he presents with great gravity as the only policy which will restore the Union land permanent peace. If slavery, as he asserts is the cause of the rebellion, what hope that his scheme of emancipation will subdue it? If the rebels are fighting for the perpetuation of slavery, and if they have deemed that olject a sufficient cause to secure a separate nationality by an ex hausting aud desolating war, is it probable that they will accept an opposite policy as terms ot peace and an ample inducement to return to their allegiance to the Federal Government? What good can be accomplished by thrusting upon the people an impracticable scheme of emancipation to still further add to the einhar ras-nicnt- of the nation? It is a proposition which the people will not accept. The public expression in the recent elections was de idedly against it, and it will be overwhelmingly so the next chance the people have to make their voice heard and felt. They will never consent to the creation of a vast public debt, which will prove a sore burden to themselves aud to their ch'ldren, for the purchase ol negroes It is idle to sup pose they are imbued with the one ideaism and the sickly sentimentality which induces Mr Lin coln to refer to the neun as " the free Ameri can, of African descent." We are engaged in a war for the suppression o the rebellion to compel revolted Sta.et to re turn to the authority of the Federa I Government upon one side; upon the other it is a struggle for an independent nationality. The so called Cou f Hiera le States have as yet manifested no dispo sitiou to yield (he contest They have submitted no terms of peace hare offered no conditions, at least so far as the country is advised, upon which they will be willing to return to the old Union. Either the independence of the South must be recognized, terms of settlement offered which will induce the rebel States to return to their former allegiance, or else the war must go on until armed rebellion is overcome, unless exhaustion or foreign intei vent ion forces a separation. Cer tainlv there is no wisdom, no foresight, no states manship, in proposing emancipation by constitu tional amendments which will require the consent of States which ure now successfully resisting the authority of the Federal Government. The question of emancipation, and all that affects the future of the negro race in our coun try, should be deferred until the Union is restored, and they can be calmly considered by all who will be affected by them. Until that period arrives, it is useless to discuss them. The whole energy of the people should first be directed to accomplir-h the objects for which Congress declared the war should be waged, the restoration of the National authority, without interfering with the institutions of the Stales recognized and protected by the Constitution. If we have not the power to do that, it is useless to propose plans for chang ng the insti tutions of States over which we cn exercise no control. Such, we think, will be the judgment of the country upon Mr Lim cl. 's compensated emancipulion aud free American, of African de-cent." colonization policy. It will be noticed tint Mr Lincoln expends his whole sympathy and thought and care upon the negro. The condition of the white Americans, who are suffering the toils and privations of the soldier; the necessities of their fa mi lies and the I deprivations of the wives and children alio by war have been bereft of their natural protectors, have no consideration with our very philan thropic President. The negro aloue absorbs all his head and ull his heart. There are other points iu the message to which we will hereafter refr. Supremacy of tin- President . lie 

IIIBJI I B operator prooao.y v. ommuveu .... error in transmitting the resolution of Senator ClaRK, approving the emancipation policy of the President, which thev make read that the Senate , ' . I . and House "recommend to him the employment r of that and every other means known to civilized , warfare to terminate the present rebellion, and assert the supremacy of the President of the United State over its entire territory and people." Some other word may have been used in the original resolution than President, but ilMi.it is an error which is significant of the policy of the pirty in power A dictator has been frequently suggested by the radicals a ruler iu whom all power should center for the government of the couutrv. They do not propose to assert the su premacy of the Constitution over all the territory heretofore known as the United States, but that of a President who will be willing to trample it under foot it necessary to accomplish their de signs. The leading radical Congressmen have declared that those who assert the supremacy of the Constitution at the present time, are in sympathy with the rebellion, hence it may be in ferred that Mr. Clark intended that all the means of warfare should be used to assert the supremacy of the President of the United States over its en tire territory and people," or, iu other words, one man power. Par ot Motdiere. It appears that Mr. Holm as, the Representative from the 4th District iu this State, anticipated Z . ,. Governor Mosto.n s message to Oor.gresa in ret- erence to an advance of the pay of soldiers. On his motion last Tuesday a resoluMtrn was adopted instructing the Committee ou Military Affairs to inquire Into and report ou the propriety of in creasing the pay of privates to $15 per mouth. Coupled with this proposition was another, direct ing the same comniguee to report upon the ex- pedieucy ot making such reductions in the sala- ries of the officers not actively engaged as may not impair the efficiency of the public service. If Mr. Holm a n should go one ttep further, and pro pose that tbe pay of officers should be tbe same as privates', with the exception of necessary ad ditional expenses, it would not only lest the patriotism of many in the service, but it would go a great way to increase its efficiency and hasten the end of the rebellion. Fortunes have been made in this war by impositions upon the Gov ernment by those who have heretofore not been able to earn more than a decent living, If that. Tim s. Washington, November 30. The delay iu the movement of the army may be easily explained. The same cause- which iu terveued to preveut General McCiellan crossing the Upper Potomac have presented themselves as insurmountable barriers for a mouth past to Gen. Burnside on tue Lower Potomac. His severe ex perience proves too truly how bis predecessor was hampered in Washington, and on whose shoul ders justly falls the responsibility of all these de lays. The President, seemingly not satisfied with Gen. Burnside's excuses, visited him as he did General McCiellan, and has seen for himself that the authorities al Washington and their in efficient subordinates are alone responsible On Friday night Gen. Burnside came to this city and had a long interview wiih Gen. H illeck, the Pres idem and Gen. Meigs. He told them plainly that the Quartermaster's Department and Engineer Corp had been greatly at laiilt, and had prevented his movement across the Rappahaimck until the ice; army had be come fortified on its opposite bank for a deter mined resistance If this state of things could not be remedied immediately, he intimated that either his resignation could be accepted, or that of the Quartermaster General demanded. These two branches r f the service have been as deficient now. and lor a month past, as Ä the time sue ceeding the Maryland battles. But it is fortunate for the truth of history, that these unanswerable facts appear after the removal of (ten McCiellan as they did before it; and ith what irresistible evidence, then, is the slander hurled back at the radicals that he was responsible tor the delay in October. Who is responsible, let me ask, for the delay iu all of November? When Gen Bum.-ide commenced his move mcnt Irom Warrenton towards Fredericksburg. he was promised faithfully that die pontoon bridges should be there from Washington as soon as ho arrived, in order that a f.. issing of the river and the occupancy of the latter city might be effected without delay. This was unfulfilled, and coupled also with delays in the transportation of supplies. A month has passed nearly. and these faults have just been remedied. In the mean time the i !!!- have got their army massed be hind fortifications, and are determined on a stout resistance there, to say nothing of their resolu tion to conte-t th step inch bv inch from the first battle ground on the Kappahanock to the rebel capital Hut uiste id ot tins state of affairs, Bu inside hoped to move light on towards Rich mond, reaching the important and strategic point of Hanover J unction before the rebels could move all of their army, or Usethesu two import nit rail roads at that point. Now tiie enemy has se cured liolh of these advantages, which even one battle and bis defeat cannot overturn. The cut ting of the Gordons illc railroad at that junction would have been n most damaging blow to the enemy, preventing the retra asportation of his supplies from Gordonsville and depriving him of the fall crops iu the Valley of Virginia. But, though the country is made to snffer, the blame is placed just where it belongs, and Gen Bum side's tri'imphant vindication of his course is a most fitting approval of that of (Jen McCiellan under precisely similar circumstances. Congre-a meets to-morrow. A more gloomy set of Senators and Representatives were never congregated here. Many of the former visit Washington for the last time, for the verdict of the people desires them in future at home Aside from this, they look gloomily on the aspect of affairs, and are talking louder about, and de nouncing harder than any one else would dare to. the imbecility that has brought this particular crisis at the door of the nation Some who clamored for emancipation see that two months of trial have produced nithini:. and that, if any thing could be gained by it either way, the rebels have only become more determined ami united, while the North has become more divided, and the Administration less active. But, notwith standing this, a slight consolation is afforded by repeated promises that something will soon be accomplished by the army. The releise of the political prisoners from the forts nid the Old Ctpitol has been forced on the Administration by long outragc.l politic opinion. Some of the arrests have been made on the most trivial and riniculous charges, involving neither crime nor disloyalty. During the past week thirtv out of fifty cases examined here were dis charged, simply for the reason that there were no charges against them! And yet the Administra lion journ its drawl out the piteous cry that 'the party has suffered from these arrests." How long will it linveluilu penance for those who have suf fered in dungeons without evidence and without onatfltl The murder of Hon. Robert E. Scott, of Vir gini.i, last spring, bv a company of Bieuker a men while under McDowell, is now undergo. ng investigation here in the court of inquiry, and at tracts much interest Mr Scott was well known in Washington, and iu fat throughout the coun try. as a ripe SOnetaf, fine orator, and a decided Union man, having opposed secession belore aud after it was accomplished His former politics were of the Whig party. He was the only South em mm who wis offered, but declined, a seil in the present Cabinet, and your correspondent was present at a public reception heie at which Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Scott first met The latter was a most accomplished gentleman, and was quite surprised when the President elect entered im mediately into a discussion on their respective bights, ami insisted on measuring belore the com -pis,.- of ladies und gentlemen present.

' , . , ' . , eniv now holds. Mr. Lincoln is not a Baft) to j t,e" plot by which this was a part. But his weak ness, irresolution and love ot ease have led him to give himself up entirely to the guidanceot the leaders of the radicals; and what they insist on he does not and will noi oppose. Thus he is, I believe, anxious that Burnside should push on toward Richmond. But the radical politicians, in order to advance their nefarious schemes, wi.o-li loot- to the senaralion of the two sections j o( lhe co,llr- bey0d all hope of reunion, have j determined to throw such obstacles iu the way of the progress ol the army as shall, lor the pres ent, prolong the war indefinitely. They are at the bottom ol all the machinations by which our brave soldiers have lieen so '.ong kept without the siioes aud -lothing necessary for their comfort articles of which many regiments are destitute even vet. And they even have the assurance to say now that the relusai of England to join France in a proposal of mediation or interference in the warletween the North and Sifnth is equiv alent to the assurance on the part of England that she will never interfere, and that we can take our t in I iu finishing the war, tor, no mailer how long i j js spun out, there will be no foreign interven tion. t herelore, the radicals urgue, ttiete is no need ol haste in our military operations, and Burnside's army may as well go into winter quar tets. It is said that it was for the purpose of suggest itiff this idea to Burnside that tiie President re centlv went to the front. Whether this be true j or not, reiy upon it, Burnside will be no party to I m07 ucn "-.saction He is lor a vigorous win- ter campaign or cm the President, without hlÄ mnn, fall u, ,... him .ilh ,, that is necessary to enable him to move at once, and successfully. So that the event of Burn aide's mov ing on, or going into winter quarters, will decide which is to rule this winter thePiesi dent or the radicals. The only events that h ive taken place since my last are the captures of two bodies ol our troops by two bodies ot Uonlederate trtops. Both of these events, so creditable (!) to our Generals, took plate on Friday last, on the R ippuhan jck, ! near Falmouth, in the virtual presence of Burn- siüe s whole army, in tue one case, nampiou a Cavalry Legion ciofsed the nver. surprised two companies ot Pennsylvania javahy, and captured over '2 XI ot them In the other case, a rebel force of both iulantry and cavalry crossed the river, and surprised and captured over 300 of our infautrv soldiers, beioit-nig to Stockton's brigade of Griffin'sdivisiori- In regard to the latter affair, it is said that Gen Hooker indulged in some very theatrical conduct, iu the course of which he broke the sword of Col. Stockton and dismissed him from the service. This wis very proper treat ment to be administered, by the one having au tbority to tk aa npon tiie person who, after a Special Correpcn1ence of the Cbicag. from Vatiingion. court-martial, was ft und guilty of the neglect. But Gen. Hooker has no authority to break the swords of officers, or to dismiss them trim t te service. The President's message, delivered to Con gress e-ierday, U just the document which an Abolition President might be expect! to deliver to an Abolitiou Congreas. It proves, it any proof were wanting, that the Administration al ways intended the war to be a war for the aboli tion of slavery. The burden of the message is, "how slavery can be abolished." The argu ments and the reasoning (if reasoning it can be called) by which Mr. Lincoln endeavors to show that slavery can be abolished, and that he can abolish it, are childish, illogical, nod superla tively weak. The idea ol proposing to the Southern Suites to abolish that system id labor which the experience of generations and the laws of an inscrutable Providence show to be tin-only one by which the products of the South can be raised, is as absurd as hi- other idea of "com pensated emancipation" is chimerical Mr. Lincoln certainly tells the tiuth when he says that "we of this Congress and this Almin istration cannot escape history." it ever theie will be an Administration held up to the scorn, the hatred, and the contempt of posterity, it will be "this Administration T' ey tound the country prosperous happy united They launched it into civil war, for the sake of a chi mera. Their dogged, sullen obstinacy caused the Southern States to secede, at a time when conciliation. Hiid five words assuring them of their rights, would hayc kept them in the Union. I he war being inaugurated, the Administration has made it a war for ihe abolition of slavery; know ii, g that, if thev succeed in this, the restoration ol the Union would be impossible During the progress ot the war the Administration has thrown away one opportunity after another for winning decisive victories, by interfering with our Gene; uls, breaking up their plans, and dismissing them from their commands The-e are some of the things for which "this Administration" will be remembered iu history. The first day's proceedings of Congress are no doubt indicative of those of the w hole session The conservative members will do all iu their power to bring the Administration to a sense of its duty, and to do justice to those who have been a.ude its victims; and the radicals will defeat these endeavors. On test question of this kind yesterday, the radicals had a clear majority ol forty. But the has that, with a House not yet full, the conservatiy es can already muster forty votes, tills the radicals with dismay. It is noticed that nearly II the talent and parliamentary skill, nearly all the men of mark and intellect, are monopolized by the conservatives; and that among the radicals me seven I men not much noted tor s'rong minds and fixed purposes. It is leared that as the se-sion progies.-es, some of these weaker vessels may be won over by arts that will not now be tied lor the first time, and that the radi cals may thus lose ten or twelve votes Ol course the efforts of the radio i Is to maintain their iscen dancy will be tieice and determined. But the power of this Congre-s for evil will be abort lived. It will expire on the 4th of Match Ou that day will terminate the weakest and the wickedest Congress with which the country has ex er been cursed. X. Wa-iuxgtom. Dec. 3. It has been retnirted here for a day or two past tint Gen Boiiisi ie has ncen lelieved of the com mind of the Army of the Potomac, and Gen Hooker appointed iti his stead. There are sev en! versions ot ihe story in circulation, but the one that seems most probable is as follows: That Gen. Burnside became convinced, from the fail ure of the President to fulfill his promises to him in regard to the necessary facilities lor the cap lure of Richmond, that it would be so during the whole campaign; that the President would con tin tie to promise him all needed reinforcements and supplies, but that the radical taction that control the President would prevent ihc-e promises from being lulfilled; and that he would be ultimately sacrificed, as McCiellan was al ter the Seven Day's Retreat. That, in conse quence ot this conviction, he requested himself to be relieved of Ins command; mid that the Pre-ident, after balancing some days between Burnside and the radicals, concluded tha' he could get along belter whliout the former than the latter, and so threw Buru-ide uvcihoard. A lew days will decide whether the leport is well founded it is rather suspicious that those who denied the charges of neglect of duty m ide against Geu MfjfatS heu Gen. McCiellan was concerned, tire now the very ones to press the same charges. now that l ten . Burnsiue is or was concerned. Whatever the lault was, it is certain tl at McUlel lati's ai m never leceived th supplies th tl ought to have been sent Iroin the Qimrtermaster's He partnient, for some of the aivisions were only supplied a lew days ago, and some are still desti tute And now the complaints Irom Burnside's armv, and of neglect on the part of Gen. Hates, are so violent it is thought that tiie latter will rasten or be lem.ived My own opinion is, alter taking some double to ascertain the facts, that, in the case ol McCleilan's urinv , Gen. Meigs en deavored to do his duty, but was thwarted by tiie inierlerence of General McCleilan's enemies in the War Department; and that, in the case of Burnside's army, the radical politicians, who wish to spin out the war, have contrived to hinder and obstruct the working of the machinery iu the Quartermaster's Depirtment, while ail the time they are loudly howling tor Burnside to ad vance. In case the report of Burnside's removal should piuve correct, it will be the only additional com mentary neciied on the imbeciKty of the Admin istration. Burnside is as much superior to Hook er as McCiellan is to Burnside. Both ol them, however, aie vastly interior to General Sumner in military capacity. But what does the Admin istration i.;.re lor capacity, except, indeed, to re move it from all fields of uselu!ne.-sY You see the telegraph, under the control of the War Department, continues to reiterate every day the story that Jackson has certainly left the Valley, and has gone to join the troops near Fredericksburg, tor the defen-e of Richmond. There is not a word of truth in the statement 'I he assurance is made in order to quiet the ap prehensions of certain timid souls heir, who can not sleep sound at night lor tear they shall be woke up by the tramp of Stuart's terrible cavalry, and who demand ot the President that at least 

1IH),(HHJ nf our best disciplined troops, com rnauded by Gens Heiniztlin an, Sigel, Abeicrora bie and Ua-ey, be left here to protect their ptecious bodies. Charles Sumner is one of the.-e gentiv, and you may be sure Mr. Lincoln will not lightly rclu-e what he asks. I don't say there are that many troops here; but I say mat certain nervous Congressmen, after visiting the torts and camps yesterday, look greatly relieved to il iv, und declare that "with such troops Wash ington is safe " But, in leganl to Jackson, he is still near Winchester, with 70.000 Confederate troops, and he is not expected to assist iu the delense of Richmond. Those facts 1 know to be true. Mr. Lincoln's head is so filled with visionary schemes toi the negroes that it is no wonder he said so little in his message about the interests ol the while people of the country He can talk by the column alout "Americans of African de scent." (is not that drawing it rather strong?) but can't find a word to say about either the progress ot the war or tue prospects ol its speedy tertni nation, or whether it is likely tobe protracted, or the gallant deeds of our brave soldiers on many a hard fought field. He has tn word of cheer for the putrio'iu soldier who has left the comforts of a happy home, and who is now shivering amid ice and sleet every night. He has not a tear or mi expression o I sorrow for the tens of thousands of brave men a ho have laid down their lives in battle, or a ho have died of disease iu hospitals. 1 he nigger the nigger the nigger is all he ' can talk ab mt Is tins a man to tie President? A great number of persons, both black and white, are now coming into our lines, professing to be deserters, refugees. Union men forced into the lebel aimy, reliable contrabands, &c. There is no doubt that many of them are spies. They relate the most marvelous stories, all ol which are swallowed with avidity by the authorities here. I um convinced, however, that one of them is an honest man. He is. or was until re cently, one of the chief clerks in the Quarter m eter's Department in Richmond. The inform ation which he imparts is indeed valuable, and he discloses some facts that are startlingly sug gestive One of them is, that, until a few weeks ago. :he greatest sttcugtli of the Coulederate army has never exceeded 466 000 men, ami has usii ally teeii below 4 HI ,000 effectives. Here is a commentary on ihe ability of tins administra tion to conduct the war. With 800,000 troops in arms, with never less than bOO.000 even when the rebels had but 300,000 we are further on now than ever Horn anv pjospecl ol a "iici csslnl termination of the war. I lie lault is patent to every one. Il is not the fault of our Generals, it lies in ihe fact that the war has been conducted by politicians and for political ends, and not by soldie.s or on military princi ples. Since the 20h of November Gen. Lee has materially changed his plans in regard to fighting at Fredericksburg. This change has been made in consequence of his knowledge nf Burnside's plans and of the designs of the government, ob tained by means of his spies here and at Fal mouth. In consequence of the knowledge thus obtained. Lee has determined to defend Freder icksbirg. and, in order to do this successfully, he is fortifying the plsce, and improving to the utmost its admiral natural advantages for de fense. It looks very doubtful now whether our army will get farther south than Falmouth this winter. X. THE F.mE IN 

ENGLAND. A Quarter of a million of People Starving. We copy the followiug items from the late for eign papers: KXTfcNT AND OR'iWTH Or THE FAMINE. The returns from the Boards of Guardians shot that for the eight weeks limn November 6, the increase Ins been at the rate of Irom 8,000 to 9,000 per week, and the figures of tho Relief Committees, if they were complete, would give even a more startling proof of the rapid spread of ile-titution. The effects, too. of the long con tinued stoppage of employment are mikingthem selves visible in many ne quarters Each week's destitution makes more rapid strides anions those various classes of tradesmen wiio, though not counted in the number of mill hands, live entirely on their wages, and to whom the witlidiawal of 136,000 from weekly circulation means little less than total ruin. Tailors, shoemakers, bakers, milliners, beerhouse keepers, and all such persons whose customers mainly belong to the working classes, arc now making their appearance in large numliers on the books both of the Guardians and the Relief Committees The stagnation of business in Manchester, too, is being felt in various ways. In many of the warehouses, every opportu lity is taken of keep ing down expenditures Some have reduced their staff of packers, porters, and all employes of a similar class; iu others they have lieen put on half time, and it is feared that, should there be no speedy improvement of trade, there will be mnny of a higher class, such as clerks, book keepers and warehousemen, thrown out of employment, and already many have had to submit to a re duction of salurv It is a rare ilnng now to see any of the great warehouses lit up at night, for. where there is nothing to do, it is better to lock up at dark and save the expense of gas. THE M MBKRS SUFFERING. On October 25th there were 208.621 persons receiving parochial relief, being above tour times rhe riimher of those relieved last year, and more by 68,4.r6 tlun the return for the last week in August last. We are further told that 143,870 persons not in receipt of parochial relief, were aided by local committees. Of 360,751 opera lives in the twenty four Unions upon which the pleasure is irre.i'est, but Ä8.63H are Pushing full time. 110,712 are "short timers," and 12.401 arc thrown out of employment The weekly lossol wages is estimated at JÜla6.094. ami 136, 004 week is mote than .7.000,000 a year. Nor does this prodigious sum repre-ent the a hole loss incurred by these districts, lor the ordinary leceipt of a manufacturer must be such as to cover not only wages, but the excuses of ma chinery, and tiie interest of capital sunk in build ings and land, besides a handsome profit. Now, U) supply the feirful deficit of J3fc6,094 in weekly wages, the Boards of Guirdians pro vide a sum which cannot be put higher than 10,000. since out of their total expenditure of JL12.0-' i hi out door and in-iloor relief, must be taken the normal cost of pauperism in average seasons The Central Relief Committee at fW mchester dispensed about 6.200 ,'25.000 month.) and the Mansion House Commit tee sent 6.500 last week. All the grants, llieielbre. from ihee sources, scarcely amount to more than a sixth of what these work peo ple have hteu in the habit of earning, and it is impossible to MBBMaO tint private charity and local funds, already exhausted, contribute tii.iie than a fraction to redress this balance. Alto gether, the subscriptions heretofore published approximate to the sum ot 400,000, but ol this a very large proportion is already expended. The General Relief Committee, in their report for the last week in Octolier. say that the number "f persons in receipt of parochial relief in 24 Unions of the district, had risen to 208.723, an addition of 45 2"J5 dining the month of October; and further, 143 ,70 persons, ntd in receipt of parochial relief, sere aided by local committees. The number of operatives in the same district in full work is now reduced to 5H,6!I8, while the number wotkiug short time is increased to 119, 912. and Ic2,4i0 are ihiown entirely out of em p'ovinent The loss of wages is estimated at 136,094 per week, and there is no doubt that the savings of the working classes are almost exhausted. Uy the close of the tir-t week of September, the reports show that the number of operatives entirely unemployed had ri.-en to about 390.660. STRUGGLES OF THK OPKBATlVKS. The calamity which has overtaken the opera tives is in no way due to any defi -iency in their own industrial character, and thev know that it is not. At the same time they hive not been im provident in the past, and yet they have not grudged to spend the last farthing accumulated 00 their providence before they would ask lor aid They luve fought against the pressure with their own strength before they would trust to any one else's strength. Even now ihey bear their misery, not as men stuetied, but as men who thoroughly understand the causes of theii sufferiim who he ieve, perh ips erroneously, but still believe, that England might extract the immediate evil by its roots, if she OOdd but venture an unwise and unju-t inter vention in American afTairs. And they elect to refrain tu k toung onto. It is for this class that there is most to be feared. Admitting tint the ex ample and UN ence of their elders will keep them patient to the end, their habits of industry mu-t be destroyed by this long idleness, and a lasting deterioration must be brought about in the whole class There are now hundreds of young men in A-htou and other towns sauntering about the streets with their hands in their pocket, congregating nt the street corners, or propping up the iatnp pooka; and whoever will devise Some scheme lor occupying their idle h inds and minds will do a great service to L inc ishire physical symptoms or st.vkvation- Lold

Stoppige ol all food, such as that e have read of in the case of the ship wrecked, brings on in a short time a train of symptoms which quickly end in the most horritde of deaths The other condition is that, when footl sufficient, if not iu abundance, gradually becomes diminished in quantity, theu iu quality, passing lo si ill another stage, where it not only ls altogether deficient in quantity, but also in the qualities nece-sarv eac day to rebuild Nature's waste, aud thus provide for next day's life. On this stinting of physical susten nice, supervenes mental depression c nisiiig loss of appetite; thus there is KOOsOBOOiafoo to partake even of that measure of food which, itself insufficient, is still necessar to keen up some existence Strange to say . at this stage of depression in mind and of gradual waste of body, the suffcter complain but little, if at all; there is tendency to sleep, rest, anyhow, anywhere, yet little evi deine of pdn. There is. however, to the skilled eie, a cast of countenance unmistakable; the children looked aged beyond their years; adults move and stieak with a gait and utterance which seemed to shun all effort. F illing fever, famine, goes on tc tun it own well marked course. I write from what I and manv others saw, watched and note I With no real complaint developed, with little real pain, there is an increase of lassitude iu the adu't, a want of all childish energy iu the young; a spe cies of pntient, Millen, hopeless despondency mas ters the whole man You have a trophv now showing itself in m-mv ways; the hair quits the head in patches, the eye funken; at this stage food fails, medicine fails: care cannot rescue.

Charles D. Murray, left on Friday for the seat of war. The 6?th regiment also left iu tbe afternoon for the same destination Iti port of the Secretary of tbe Interior. OCR MI.M.&AL BfcSOCECES. The following passages are taken from the re port of Judge EimoNns. Commissioner of the Luid Office, to the Department of the Interior: In passing from the consideration of the pie liminarv questions which have arisen in connec tion with the Pacific route, the importance of which to the country cannot be over-estimated, it will be found that Congress has dealt with the measure with a comprehensive spirit of liberalitv, as the grant which awards to the work au amount ol five alternate sections per mile on eich side of said road thus concedes a tielt of 6.400 acres for every mile ol its length, embracing iu all some filteeii and a half millions of acres. This meas ure, with au existing thirty thousand miles ot rail Was now spreading Irom the Atlantic beyond the Mississippi, will form a great continental sys tern, reaching from ocean to wean, eventually Iotas Oil llan every political subdivision of the United State-1, thereby giving impetus to domestic trade and interests, ojieniiig new fields of labor and prosperity within our limits, while our wealth will be incieised by the rich Kasteru trade, through our mercuitile marine on the Pacific, wuh Japan and distant India. Among the-e new fields coal is found in vre.it variety and nbund ance between the Mississippi and the Pacific. That important element, so essential for domes tic, mechanical a.i.l manufacturing purposes, af fecting our v st internal intercourse and trade and our external commerce, is of course a very prominent object of interest to our people. The extent of the twelve coal bearing States east of the Mississippi holds out a small proportion to the immense coal fields west of that re -ion we have information reporting the existence of coal in Dacotah. Kinsas, Nebraska. Colorado. Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washing ton. Commissioner Edmonds names some reliable coal deposits in the region in question, and then proceeds to the con-ideratton of the specially at tractive gold region of the public domain. It stretches on the western portion of the continent from 49 degrees north latitude to 31 degrees 30 min , and from the 102d degree of longitude to the Pacific Ocean, embracing portions of Daco tah, Nebraska. Colorado, all of New Mexico, wi'h Arizona, Utah, Nevada. California, (he ,.n I and Washington Territory. Its breadth is about I 1.100 miles from north to south, and of nearly equal longitudinal extension, making an area of m W0 than a million of acres This vast region is traversed from north to south on the Pacific side by the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Moun tains, then by the Ulue and Htun'ioldt : an the east by the double ranges of the Rockj Moun -- : .u nr.. . . i. n- r, , . tains, embracing the Was itch. Wind River chain and the Sierra Madre, s-relehing longitudinal! v iind in laternal spurs crossed ami linked to gether by intervening ridges, connecting the whole system by live arhnlpat ranoOP, dividing the country into an equal number ol basins, each being nearly surrounded by mount tins ami w.i tereo by mountain streams and snows, thereby interspersing this immense territory with bodies of agricultural lands equal to the support ol not only miners, but of a dense population. Those mount litis are literally stocked with minerals, gold and silver being interspersed in profusion over iheir immense surface, and daily brought to light by new discoveries. The precious metals ate found embedded in mountains of qinrtz, rich washings marking lhe path ays af rivers and floods. Besides their wealth in gold, no p.irt of the world is so rich in silver mines as Nevada and New Mexico; vet these may be esti mated onl vi arooOSOioo to the gold fields, which are in proceswol development with amagioi re suits. The recent discoveries in the Colorado region of California, and in the regi n stretching thence away up to and north i f Salmon river, in W shingtoii Territory, are every day stimulating the mining enterpii.-e of our BOOolo. Prior to the gold discoveries of l!f48 in Cali fornia, the gold product of the world was only au annual average of 18j060J6B. In lf53 the yield of California r.ts $70,000.000. and that sum mav be set down as the piesent average from that Stale If our other gold fields were worked with an equal ratio of labor, there would be an anuu tl product of between three and four hundred millions. That un inad cqti ite amount of labor will be at hand alien I ice returns is not doubted; and hereby Judge hd moods sees the easy step by which the ma-s f our present soldiery may be restored to peaceful avociiioiis BrOO now, in the distant 1 erritorv of Washington, the extreme mosaic block of the Union, the present product of the S-ilmon river I minis, ic , under every disadvantage of access, weather, Sir. , is e-timaled at M 0.

I Mill An immense revenue miy be readily obtained by lubjecting the public mines either to lease, under quarterly payments or quarterly tax, as soignorage npon the actual product, under a well regulated and efficient system, which would stim ulate the energies of miners and c ipitalists, by seeming to such classes an undisputed interest in local ties for specified purposes (and alien the conditions as to such fact aie completed) lor un limited tseriods, and which, etfectin this with beneficial results to ilieni. would relieve the ne cessities of the Republic Commissioner Kdmonds states that the ma tured yield of the mines at eight per cent, would pay an interest of lour and a halt percent, upon $ti K) .000 .000 of intiotia! debt. Going into par Oculars, it i- stated that the u-ual size of a min ing cl.nm in the quartz region is one hundred feet ou each side, making one thousand two hun dred claims to the square mile Allow that only a hundredth part of the mountain is occupied in paying leads or veins, there will be spice for three millions six hundred thousand claims.

The Secretary of War details tbe military op erations during the past year; points lo tbe fact that the Department of the Pacific has been tree from any bf tho calamities occasioned by the re bellion ; ii earnest and deep sympathy has been manifested by the loval ciiisens of the Pacific Slates in support of the Union. From a cuivey of the whole field of operations it is apparent, whatever disasters our arms may have suffered at particular points, a great advance h s been made since the commencen en.f the war. The Union forces are now in the field under able command ers, stronger than ever, resolute and eager to bo led against the enemy, to crush the rebellion by a vigorous Wim ir c .mpaign. The armies of the Potomac and the West stand ready to riewith each other in dealing the quickest aud heaviest blows agaiust the enemy. Taught by experience of the ruin of inaction and the hazard of delay, a spirit of earnest activity seems to pervade tho forces of the United States beyond what has hith erto been exhibited. Iu the uumerous battles and movomeuts that have occurred, our armies iu gcneial have displayed the coursge and deter mination that should inspire officers aud soldiers fighting in dt-fense of their Government. Under the calls of Julv and August there are alreadr in the field 420.k)0 new troops, of which jHS.OOO are volunteers. 332.000 of whom volunteered for three years or the war. It will be remembered the call was nude at one of those periods of de spondency which occur in every national struggle. A chief hope of those who set the rebellion on loot was for aid i-nd comfort from disloyal sym pathizers in the Northern States, whose efforts were relied upon to divide and distract the people of the North and prevent them from putting forth their whole strength lo pre-erve the National existence The call for volenleers and a draft ot the mili i fin :itTor.lpd un nrmlLMi lor dtsl.. .1 MniAh. I n accomplish their evil purposes by discouraging enlistments and encouraging opposition to the war and the draft ol oldiers to carry it on. Anxiety was felt in some States at the prob able success of these disloyal practices, and the Government tu urged to adopt measures of pro tection by temporary restraint ol those engaged ill these hostile acts. To that end Provost Marshals were apoointed iu some States upon the nomination of their Gov ernors, to act under the direction of the State Ex ecutive, aud the writ of habeas corpus was iui riended by our order. Some inst'iices of unauthorized arrests have occurred, and when brought to the notice of the Department, the parties have been immediately discharged. By a recent order, all persons arrested for dis couring enlistments or 'or disloyal practices in the Slates where the quotas of volunteers are filicd up, have been teleased. Every means the country affords has been put forth to complete tl e armaments of our torts Mid fortifications for the deieuse ol harhois and coasts, as is shown by the report of this bureau; thoscde tails are for obvious reasons not now stated, and this legi-l ilion required by this branch of the ser v ice will, by your direction, be communicated to the appropriate commit ec l he subject of arm ing the fortifications, particularly tho-e defending the harbors of our principal Atlantic ports, has received special attention, and all the means at the disposal of the Department have lieen applied to that end, so lar as was possible and consistent with meeting other imfierative requirements. Iu consequence of the introduction into naval warfare of iron clad vessels comparatively safe from the effects of such batteries as had hitherto been sufficient to guard effectually against the passage of hostile vessels, it became necessary to provide heavier and more powerful ordnance. The a hole sy stem o! such armament was carefully revised and amended by a hoard of the most ex perienced and competent officers, and measures have been taken lo carry their recommendations into effect. ' be PrcnldrnC Plan. The New "i ork Herald, in commenting upon the f resident's plan of closing out the rebellion, remarks that "promising the abolition of slavery to the radicals after their death, is like offering to free all slaves if the Abolitionists will allow them selves to be hung," aud then adds: But are we, then, in favor of the President 'a plan? Certainly we are. We are in favor of any plan for the good of mankind, including the plan fur planting the Central Park with those tiees which bear roast pigs for fruit, and the plan tor building a railroad across the Atlantic, with a branch road to the moon. Let Congress pass the requisite acts immediately, und make the Presi dent's projects effective. It is a long time from lt62 to 11)00. There will he a great niany changes before these thirty seven jears and one mouth are over. Weexpect to cany every Suite bv a conservative majority before that period. We expect to elect several conservative Piesi dents and Congresses before the emancipation Uiillcuium dawns. If anything is badly legis lated now a days, we rely upon these future inlets to rete.il it and straighten matters out. In 1000 the war will be almost lorgot en. and little boys and girls, jet unborn, will be studying its history in their school books In 1000 Greeley rill hive graduated at the almshouie 01 the lu natic asylum, and his vetv name will be lost in j oblivion, or remernbeied only with those of Judas I scariot, Benedict Arnold and Jeff. Davis. lo j 19(H) Beet 1 1 er and Cheever will be testing the ' truth of some of their sermons Iu 1900 Phil ! !is. Garrison and Gerrit Smith will be atoning ' lor the misery they have caused. In 1900 the I nation aiil be greder, purer and more powerful I than its present condition would indicate.

Half j of them would have been freed thirty vears ago j if the lanatieal Abolitionists had not chosen lhe I negro us a hack upon which lo ride into high po j Btojal phn es. All that is necessary to end this rebellion and j lestore the Union is to set the negro aside and ! settic treason by hard knocks. If the President 'a 1 idea is to accomplish this by postponing Siml0 I until 1901, we think it an excellent scheme, and i will support it loyally. We have always ad inn od the Piesnieut as a joker, but we never im-gined that he could so aptly blend ex I quisite humor and practical common sense in an I official document. lie knows tint the agitation about slavery hinders t'ne war, and he is right in ' desir tig to post one this sgitatkm. In fact, a ! truce on the negro question until 1900 is a mili tary necessity. As such the Abolitionists wiilbe i obliged to so .iint to it with their customary ; grace. We see no reason, indeed, why the a hole j country should not be unanimous upon the sub ject None of ihe present generation need ob ject to the President's plan; for. as the message says, we shall not have to pay the taxes to carry il into operation, and shall all be in our dotage or j iu our graves belore it is consummated. The fu ture generation is in no condition to object now, . and we are not aware that anybody except, per ; h ips, one ot the spiritual mediums can claim to ! tl'lr representative, and object for them It i is out ousiiirss io sevuie n couiiui iui inc imuic generations to daell in; acd as they must pay the emancipation taxes, certainly they ought to be allowed to arrange the darkey's status for them selves, we repeat, tbeietore. that congr should immediately adopt the President's sug p est ions, and then, having disposed of the inev itable African until 1900, we can direct our whole attention to the vigorous prosecution of the war for the Union and the Constitution. Goreranirnl Bankiag. In allusion to the recommendation of tho ! President that a system of banking be established Federal stocks, the Sentinel remarks: "It is the old plan ol burning the candle at both ends Interests on stocks and on the notes predicated on them a double inteiest lor tbe falKir of ihe country to pay ia the result. It is a fine absorbing process of the values of the country for the benefit ot financiers and capi talisU." More truthful words were never written. Tho scheme is characteristic of the party in power.
