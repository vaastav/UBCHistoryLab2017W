After the accusa tions and Insinuations against President Taft in connection with this letter were thoroughly circulated. Chairman Graham and his Democratic colleagues dropped all effort to find out anything further about It, and the attempts of the Repub lican members of the committee to secure an Investigation of the mysterious mis sive were fruitless Chairman Graham now says he Is not Interested in the letter. It Is confidents expected that the three Republican members of the committee will submit a minority report, on some phases of the matter at least. The report insists that the administra tion's policy has undergone a complete change since the committee began its in quiry, and sajs It Is fair to assume that the visit of Secretary of the Interior Fisher to Alaska last summer, which preceded President Taft's alleged change of front, was a direct result of disclosures before the committee.

All through Mr. Taft's message emphasis was laid upon the value to the country of big business, the necessity and legality of big business and the fact that big business must be encouraged. But the trouble Is that Mr, Taft's (Utterances In this respect are signally qualified by the suit brought at his direction against the United States Steel Corporation. The opinion gains ground neverthe less, as it haa for several weeks past, that the climax of attack upon business for political ends has been reached. The people, even the people In the West, are becoming tired of this agitation against business men and business cor porations.

WOULD ELIMINATE MANY ARMY POSTS Secretary Stimsoii Favors Concentration Scheme. An ambitious programme of reform in the military establishment of the United States is outlined In the first annual report of Henry I Stlmson, Secretary of War One of the most important of Secre tary Stimson's proposals affecting the army is the concentration of the scat tered units of the armj. both for the purposes of economy and efficiency as a: defensive and offensive weapon; main taining a large portion of the regiments of the mobile army at wnr strength. In stead of keeping them in the present state of depletion changing the con ditions of enlistment so as to create a reserve force of men In civil life with military training to be available In the event of a sudden call to arms, and the establishment of a reserve supply of ammunition for the field artillery. The changes recommended by Secre tary Stlmson are in accord with those being urged by Maj Gen. Leonard Wood, Chief of Staff, and other officers of the General Staff of the army. Many of his suggestions, sajs the Secretary, are the result of lessons learned from the mo bilization on the Mexican border last spring. Secretary Stlmson denounces the pres ent post sjstem through which, he says, we have scattered our army over the country as If it were merely groups of local constabulary Instead of a national organization." He adds: The additional demands made upon the army by the fortifications in Hawaii, the Canal Zone, and In the Philippines make It more Imperative than ever, the Secre tary believes, that the small force avail able be disposed of to the best possible advantage. Despite the pressure of lecal influences deriving profit from the pres ence of soldiers In a git en section, the army, the Secretary argues, should be freed from the present post system as far as possible. Of the field artillery situation, the Sec retary says: "There Is not enough field artillery am munition for the guns we now have for a single engagement such as were fre quent in the Manchurlan war. The man ufacture of this material Involves processes requiring much time, and there is no way to hasten. It follows, of course, that provision must be made for such material long in advance of its probable use. At the present rate of appropriation It Is estimated that it would take more than fifty years to se ct re a reasonably "supply of the fl-Id artillery guns, carriages, and ammunition that would be, necessary hi the event of .war,- -j .
