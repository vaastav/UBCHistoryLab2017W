Morning or Evening— One Year Six Months Three Months Morning, Evening and Sunday—One Year CIST OABBXBB SEX Senators feel that they have been slighted in the peace conference preparations. Many of them demand that they be taken into consideration as the constitution provides, and if the president will not do so, they pro pose to act independently. The constitution says the president "shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the senate concur." Whatever is accomplished at Versailles in the way of treaties will have to go to the senate for approval. It will be interesting to see what happens. In the mean time, the president is blithely on his way to France, and the senators he left behind are starting a little waf of their own. 

EXTRADITING THE KAISER The British war cabinet has decided to ask Holland to hand over William Hohenzolleim so that he can be tried in London on charges of murder—charges tnat have been pending since the first German air raid on the metropolis. There also is a demand that the ex-emperor £e brought to America to answer charges in this country. Mrs. Catherine Callan Hayden, of Chicago, daughter of Patrick Callan, who lost his life when the Lusitania was sunk, has asked the United States district attorney to issue a warrant for the former kaiser, charging him with murder. The warrant has not been issued, but an assistant in the attorney's office promised to look into treaty rights between America and Holland to determine whether or not William can be extradited. William can be extradited, providing he can be con victed of or charged with murder under the laws of the Netherlands, where he now is a fug1five from justice. On June 2, 1887, representatives of the American and Dutch governments concluded an extradition treaty, the ratifications of which were exchanged on May 21, 1889. The treaty provides that: "The United States of America and His Majesty, the King of the Netherlands reciprocally engage to deliver up to justice all persons convicted of or charged with any of the crimes or offenses enumerated committed within the respective-Jurisdiction of the Uni ted States of America, or of the kingdom of the Nether lands, exclusive of the colonies thereof, such persons being actually within such jurisdiction when the crime or offence was committed, Who shall seek an asylum or shall be found within the jurisdiction of the other QUIET—AT PRESENT (From the New York Times.)

TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 3, 1918. THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENT The expected has happened. The senate has before it a resolution proposing that a commission from tnat body, consisting of four Democrats and four Republi cans, be sent to Versailles to keep the senate informed as to what happens there. Another resolution proposes that congress declare that the president's trip to l^ance constitutes an inability to act aa chief executive and that during his absence the vice president must act. No one can tell what will happen the resolutions, but all know that they will, occasion a merry fight in the upper body. The senate is in no frame of mind to deal kindly with the president. Democrats as well as Republicans have been stirred to enmity because the president has not consulted them in his plans for the peace conference. He appointed his own peace delega tion without seeking counsel of the senate, without ask ing its approval. When he delivered his address Mon day, he made no announcement of his plans, except that he was going to the conference and that he would keep in touch with congress by cable. .60 patches. He may be as dead and Ite, surrenJer and Ludendorff, we are gone as he seems to be, but on the other hand he may not: and in our P°intn opinion it is desirable to keep in mind the possibility that he may not even P°leon that he is. The German people are not Bol shevlki by nature, nor are they demo crats or republicans by nature. They have been brought up by hand ever since the days of the grand elector.1 We have a loose way of talking about ho\p they have been depending on the kaiser "for forty years" why, the Prussians have been depending on him for over 200 years. The only new thing in the matter of depend ence that came in forty yeati ago was the depen&ence on him of all the •. German states which hitherto had been depending on him or the Aus trian emperor or their own kings. The Prussian was taken'by the scruff of his neck by the grand elector, Frederick William, and Frederick the Great and fairly poured into his clothes until he was the exact mode! previously designed by those princely tailors it was the same thing Peter the Great undertook to do for Rus sia, less successfully.

Next we read that 100 regi ments demand the immediate convo cation of a constituent assembly they want somebody obey, and want it right away. Meanwhile the new government's first act was to appoint Hindenburg commander of the army. His sword is at its service, he says. The army would probably obey Hindenburg" anyway, but thus doubly constituted commander there is no doubt about its obeying him. Hindenburg was al ways loyal to the kaiser, even when the kaiser was not loyal to him, as in the case of his dispute with Lu dendorff, when Hindenburg wanted ins,,rted what as 1 '."A '.. on going oir.

There is no resemblance, however, between Elba and Maastricht. Na poleon was exiled to Elba, but Wil liam went to Holland of his own free will, and though he "signified his desire to abdicate," there has not yet •been produced a single scrap of writ ing from him with the word "abdica tion" in it. He has gone a few miles away from Germany to watch events. He can stay there until after the peace conference is over. Then, whatever Germany—meaning the sol diers, who are all the power there is in Germany—may decide to do, the Allies will have no right to interfere with it and, with their disbanded armies, no power. What will Germany decide to do? Proclaim a republic? If "Mr. Hohen f? 5rn.'„has any p,an ln 1 The president offered no solution for the mind, that will not interfere with it.

There is enough evidence to convict the kaiser on Innumerable charges of murder,. arson and wanton de struction. Great Britain and' America can demand that Holland hand him over, and unless Holland desires to shield him, she should extradite him immediately. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Those who expected President Wilson, In his address to congress, to make some announcement of his peace "conference plans were disappointed. He )ad nothing to say as to his program, except that he goes to give "per sonal counsel In Um interpretation and application" of the bases of peace he outlined to congress on January 8, 1918. On that day, he gave his fourteen principles to the world, but these principles have gone througlT the tire of world opinion since then, and, while the Allies and the Central Powers have accepted them as a basis for nego tiation, it is felt in many quarters that some of them will have to be changed. Some of the principles are not very clear when one attempts to apply them to conditions cre ated by the war, but the president made no attempt in his address to make them so or to more definitely outline his program. This will be done at the preliminary con ferences. The president told congress that he would keep in close touch with home affairs. He will be available for counsel and decision at all times, he said, and he pleaded for the co-operation of congress and the public. Co-op eration from the senate, so far as the peace conference is concerned, is going to be hard to get, for the gentle men of that body do not like the way in which the ex ecutive has overlooked them in his plans. The temper of the upper house was shown when Republican senators remained silent at the conclusion of the president's ad dress. Before announcing his plans to attend the peace con- 1 ference, the president discussed at length the economic equally compensated for, as for the confiscation of money and several problems facing the country. He gave words of pra.so to the -brave soldiers and sailors who had gone to Prance bond newly issued for the purpose, which should have the characteristic and who helped keep the seas free, and he spoke elo- temporary transitional means until quent words of honor for the women of America, whose ian improved feature makes its ap pearance in a new society. only reward, he said, should be "to make them the equals in other regards individuals may be ol in political risM, th.y b.v. proved tho„,,lve,! their equals in every field of practical work they have their professions or Occupations. Another important feature was the discussion of em ployment for returning soldiers. Many will be without work, he pointed out, and congress must do something to give them employment and homes. He asked that many of them be put to work reclaiming the vast areas of arid and swamp land, a work which already has been under taken, but which can be enlarged to greatly solve the problem of aiding the soldier. A 

HARD WINTER FOR KINGS These be parlous days fo^kings! When President Wilson spid that "the world must be made safe for de mocracy," he started an international house-cleaning that now is getting results. William of Hohenzollern has gone, although dispatches say he is attempting^) return. Kaiser Karl also has quit his throne and his palace, and, at last reports, had neither clothes nor a place to go. One by one the kingdoms of Germany are ridding themselves of their Imperial ones—the small fry who danced around in the shadow of the All Highest. Wur temburg is the latest to act. King William II, cousin of King Charles who, despite the fact that Wurtemburg was antagonistic to Prussia, let his country share in the Ger man enthusiasm for war with France, has abdicated. His people will miss him no more than the world does. The Skupshtina, or national assembly, of Montenegro suddenly developed a bit of independence and the result is that King Nicholas must go. The assembly has de posed him and he has declared for a union with Serbia under King Peter. Thus are many of the &mall countries assisting in solving the problems which face the peace conference delegates. When they have determined a few things for themselves, it will be easier to handle the great naUoial and international questions that must be polved at Ver sailles. soldier-rldden Germany, with its pas sion for obedience, and yet President Bonaparte's translation of himself into Emperor Napoleon was almost bloodless. It is no wonder that Holland is re ported as getting uneasy over Wil liam's presence. So will the world be, before long.

We will make here a suggestion which furnishes us fa. method to pre vent the appearance of the rich, and avert the consequent result of the dif ference between rich aod poor. The suggestion consists of the entire dis use of the money over the world, in order to give the struggle for exis tence a check, to make way with the difference of rich and poor, and thus to promote peace and equality In the public life of mankind.. It is through the medium of the money that wealth is accumulated, and the accumulation entails the dif ference of rich and poor, with its re sultant struggle for existence. This state of things is most unde sirable. The end of mankind is not to be pro\id of individual talent or ability, but to co-enjoy the peace in the world, just as in a family, and any cause which brings about afly in equality in public life must be radi cally eliminated. It i« for this rea son that we dare to suggest the dfs use of the money to prevent the dif ference of rich and poor. What crafty fellow ever introduced the money for use in human life? Of course, nationalisation of various val uables. such as gold, silver, jewels, etc., shall be implied in the disuse of the money and their ownership by in dividuals be prohibited. Such val uables retain their values only when they are used as a means of inequal ity, but will be nothing more than those pebbles on the road when equal ity is to be prevalent. They may havfe some value in giving us a good feel ing on account of their elegance, then they may" be used, under public own ership, for the decoratton of shrines, temples, churches, halll and many other like buildings to the common pleasure of 'the public at large. Most complicated troubles may arise from the adjustment of proper ties after the enforcement of the dis use of the money.

Unionism The Hopeful Solution Of All Labor Problems, Says Walker Bloomington, 111., Dec. 2.—Until In dustrial justice shall become the es tablished rule among men, no guar antee of permanent world peace can be held forth, John H. Walker, retir ing president of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, declared ln his annual report to the convention here today. Mr. Walker, who has served five years, and who will not be a can didate for re-election, characterized trade unionism and the co-operative movement as the most hopeful solu tion of labor problems. tvwe must establish conditions re quiring every man and woman to deal justly in all economic transactions with other men and women before we have peace." he said. "Peace must follow justice, and there will be no justice while men and women who are selfish, unscrupulous, cunning and powerful have the legal' right to serve their own selfish ends by taking advantage of other men's ignorance, lack of organization and helpful ness." Indorsing the co-operative move ment. Mr. Walker declared It would procure for the consumers, a big ma jority of whom are actual workers, the necessities at approximately cost. While cut price methods will not be used, the speaker said the difference between actual cost of operation and the prices charged will be paid back to members of the co-operative so ciety quarterly as a dividend. "The next step is establishment of the wholesale department which al ready has Jeen taken ln Illinois through the Central Co-operative so ciety. While we lack funds, we will deal with the large wholesalers and possibly some manufacturers and de pend on bur ability to purchase in large lots. But' later on, when wo have accumulated sufficient funds to establish our own office headquarters, our own storage warehouses and side tracks, we will deal with the manu facturer and the farmer directly, and save all extortion or cost on account of unnecessary hilddlemen. Where the manufacturers or farmers refuse to do business on an honest basis we will manufacture and enga&e in agri culture ourselves." The report said the Illinois Federa tion had grown in Ave years from a membership of 86,000 to an enroll ment of 190,000' xrtth a total of 850, 000 affiliated indirectly through sixty central bodies. The report approved the calling of the proposed constitutional conven tion to revise the basic law of the state and urged the necessity of elect ing delegates friendly to labor. 

THEY BECOME EXPERTS. Denvpr, Colo., Dec. 3.—Members of the state constabulary stationed at the Union passenger station in Den ver to prevent the importation of whiskey are becoming experts at guessing the contents of suitcases and ®a8»ue me cumeuu. ui *nu fips without opening them,.accord ing to Captain Harry F. Allen of the constabulary. "I think that our men are not wrong more than once in a hundred times when th®y "top a mafi and ask him to open his suitcase." he said. "One look at a man carrying a suit case is .usually sufficient to tell them whether they are dealing with an or dinary traveler or a bootlegger." A suitcase filled with whiskey, he said, weighs from sixty to eighty pounds. A man cannot parry it with a loose, careless grip of the hand. Another thing 'that members of the constabulary have observed is that a heavily loaded suitcase strikes against a man's leg. TO LEAVE ON LONG TRIP. Dawson, Y.

The opinion is held that Holland will not be disposed to put obstacles in the way.
