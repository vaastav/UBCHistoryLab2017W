PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The following message was read in the senate and house of representatives to-day: To the Congreea of the United States: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition of the national finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful consider­ ation. The amount of money annually ex­ acted through the operation of present laws from the industries and necessities of the people largely exceeds the sum neces­ sary to meet the expenses of the govern­ ment. When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every cit­ izen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share towards the careful and economical maintenance of the government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is inde­ fensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil conse­ quences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate ob­ jects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlescly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crip­ pling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing in­ vestment in productive enterprise, threat­ ening financial disturbance and 

INVITING SCHEMES OF PUBLIC PLUNDER. Ths condition of our treasury is not altogether new, aud it has more than once of late been submitted to the people's representatives in congress, whp alone can apply a remedy, and yet the situation still continues, with aggra­ vated incidents, more than ever presaging financial convulsion and widespread dis­ aster. It will not do to neglect this situa­ tion, because its dangers are not now pal­ pably imminent and apparent. They exist none the less certainly and await the un­ foreseen and unexpected occassion when suddenly they will be precipitated upon us. On the 30th day of June, 1885, the excess of revenues over public expenditures after complying with the annual requirement of the sinking fund act was $17,859,735.31 during the year ended June 30, 1886, such excess amounted to $49,405,545.20, and dur­ ing the year ended June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55,567,849.54. The annual con­ tributions to the sinking fund during the three years above specified amounting in the aggregate to .$138,058,320.94, and de­ ducted from the surplus as stated, were made by catling in for that purpose out­ standing 8 per cent, bonds of the govern­ ment. During the six months prior to June 30, 1887. the surplus revenue had grown so large by repeated accumulations that it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so affect the business of the country that the sum of $79,864,100 of such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the 3 percent, bonds still outstanding and which were then payable at the option of the government THIS PRECARIOUS CONDITION OF THE FI­ NANCIAL AFFAIRS among the people still needing relief, immediately after the 30th day of June, 1887, the remainder of the 3 per eent. bonds then outstanding, amount­ ing witlrprincipal and interest to the sum of $18^877,500. were called in and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the cur­ rent fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the treasury department, representations of distress in business cir­ cles not only continued, but increased, and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these circumstances the contribution to the sink­ ing fond for the current fiscal year was at once completed by the expenditure of $27, 484.283L65 in the purchase of government bonds not yet due bearing 4 and 4% per cent interest, the premium paid thereon averaging 24 per cent for the former and 8 per cent, for the latter. In addition to the interest accruing during the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebted­ ness the government was to some ex­ tent anticipated, and banks selected as de­ positories of public money were per­ mitted to somewhat increase their depos­ its. While the expedients thus employed to release the people, the money lying idle in the treasury seemed to avert the dan­ ger. Our surplus revenues have continued to accumulate, the excess for the present year amounting on the 1st dav of December $55,258,701.19 and estimated to reach the sum of 8118, 000,000. On the 80th of June next it is ex­ pected that this sum, added to present ac cumulations, will swell the surplus in the treasury to 9140,000.000. There seems to be no assurance that with such a with­ drawal from the use of the people's circu­ lating medium our business community may not in the near future be Subject to the same distress which was quite lately produced from the same cause, and while the functions of our. national treasury should be few and simple, and while its best condition will be reached, 1 believe, by its entire disconnection with private business interests, yet when by a perver­ sion of its purposes IT 

IDLY HOLDS MONE^Y uselessly substracted from the channels of trade, there seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should be devised by the government to restore in an emergency, without waste or extrava­ gance, such money to its place among the people, If such an emergency arises, there now exists no clear and undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore the redemption of 3 per cent, bonds, which were payable at the option of the govern­ ment, has afforded a means for the dis­ bursement of the excess of our revenues but these bonds have all been retired and there are no bonds outstanding the payment of which we have the right to insist upon. The contribution to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occasion for expend­ iture in the purchase of bonds, lias been already made for the current year, so that there is no outlet in that direction. In the present state of legislation the only pre­ tense of any existing executive power to restore at this time any part of our surplus revenues to the people by its expenditure consists in the supposition that the secre­ tary of the treasury may enter the market and purchase the bonds of the government not yet due at a rate of premium to be agreed upon. The only provision of law from which such a power could be derived is found in an appropriation bill passed a number of years ago, and it is subject to the suspicion that it was intended as tem­ porary and limited in its application in­ stead of conferring a continuing discretion and authority. No condition ought to ex­ ist which would justify the grant of power to a single official upon his judgment of its necessity to withhold from or release to tjie business of the people in an unusual manner money held in the treasury, and if it is deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of the treasury the authority in the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plainly vested and provided as far as pos­ sible with such checks and limitations as will define this official's right and discretion and at.the same time relieve him from uudue responsibility. In considering the question or purchasing bonds as a means of 

RESTORING TO CIRCULATION THE SURPLUS MONEY accumulating in the treasury, it should be borne in mind that premiums must, of course, be paid upon such pur­ chase, that there may be a large part of these bonds held as investments which cannot be purchased at any price and that combinations among holders' who are will­ ing to sell may unreasonably enhance the cost of snch bonds to the government. It has been suggested that the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest and the difference between the old and new security paid in cash, thus finding use for the surplus in the treasury. The value of this plan it is apparent must de­ pend upon the valition of the holders of the present bonds, and it is not entirely certain that the inducement which must be offered them would result in more financial benefit to the government than the pur­ chase of bonds while the latter proposition would reduce thff principal of the debt by actual payment instead of extending it The proposition to deposit the money held by the government in banks throughout tne country for use by the people is, it seems to me, exceedingly objectionable in principle, as establishing too close a rela­ tionship between the operations of the government treasury and the business of the country and too extensive a commingling of their money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance in pri vate business upon public funds. If this scheme should be adopted it should only be done as a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and ex­ ecutive effort should generally be in the opposite direction and should have a ten­ dency to divorc« as much and as fast as can safely be done the treasury depart­ ment from private enterprise. Of course it is not expected that unnecessary and ex­ travagant approprtations will be made for the purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess of revenue. Such ex­ penditure, beside the demoralization of all 

JUST CONCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC DUTY which it entails, stimulates a habit of reck­ less improvidence not in the least consist­ ent with the missions of our peopie or the high and beneficient purposes of govern­ ment. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my country­ men, as well as to the' attention of their representatives charged with the responsi­ bility of legislative relief, the gravity of our financial situation. The failure of congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessa­ rily produce caused a condition of finan­ cial distress and apprehension since your last adjournment which taxed to the ut­ most all the authority and expedients within the executive control, and these ap­ pear now to be exhausted. If disaster re­ sults from the continued inaction of congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the sitnation thus far considered is fraught with dan- §lough er which should be fully realized and it prevents features of wrong to the people, as well as peril to the country, it is Dut the result growing out of a per­ fectly palpable ana apparent cause con­ stantly reproducing the same alarming circumstances—a congested national treas­ ury and a depleted monetary condition in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only be saved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cause. Our scheme of taxation by which needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treasury consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the consumption of tobacco and spirituous hnd malt liquors. It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to internal revenue taxation are strictly speaking nec­ essaries. There appears to be no Just com­ plaint of this taxation by the consumers of these articles, and there seems to Oe noth­ ing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequi­ table and illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended. These laws, as their primary and plain effect, raise the prices to con­ sumers of all articles imported and subject to duty by precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who pur­ chase for use these imported articles. Many of these thhigs, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and THE 

DUTIES NOW LEVIED UPON FOREIGN GOODS and products are called protection to these home manufactures, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed arti­ cles and sell them for a price equal to that demanded for the imported goods that have paid customs duty. So it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported articles, millions of our people, who never us? and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase aud use things of the same kind made in this country and pay therefore nearly or quite the same charged price which the duty adds to the imported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury, but the great majority of our citizens, wh buy domestic articles of the same class, pay a sum at least approximately equal to this duty to the manufacturer This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of Instruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upou those whoconsume domestic products as well as those who consume imported ar­ ticles, and thus create a tax upon all our people. It is not proposed to entirely re­ lieve the country of this taxation. It must be extensively continued as the source of the government's income, and in a read­ justment of our tariff the interests of American labor engaged in manufacture should be carefully consided, as well as the preservation of our manufacturers. It may be called protection, or by any other name, but relief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be devised with especial precaution against imperiling the existence of our manufac­ turing interests. But this existence should not mean a condition which, without regard to public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of im­ mense profits instead, of moderately profit­ ably returns. As the volume and diversity of our national activities increase, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuance of the advantages which they conceive the present system of tariff taxa­ tion directly affords them. So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the present con­ dition been resisted by those or our fellow citizens thus engaged that they can hardly complain of the suspicion entertained to a certain extent that there exists an organ­ ized cdmbination all along the line to main­ tain their advantage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations and with becom­ ing pride we rejoice in 

AMERICAN SKILL AND INGENUITY, in American energy an I enter­ prise anfc in the wonderful natural ad­ vantages and resources developed by the country's national growth. Yet, when an attempt is made to justify a scheme which permits a iax to be laid upon every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers quite beyond a reasonable demand for governmental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy to call our man­ ufacturers infant industries, still pending in "the highest and greatest degree of every favor and fostering care that can be wrung from federal legislation. It is also said that it increases in price of the domestic manufac­ tures resulting from the present tariff is necessaro in order that higher wages may be paid to workingmen employed in man­ ufactories than are paid for what is called the pauper labor of Europe. All will acknowledge the force of an argument which involves the welfare and liberal compensation of our laboring people. Labor is honorable in the eyes of every American citizen, as it lays the foundation of our development and progress. It is entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to the utmost regard. The standard of our laborers' life should not be measured by that of any other country less favored and they are entitled to their full share of all our ad­ vantages. By the last census it is made to appear that of the 17,392,099 of our popula tion engaged in all kinds of indnstries, 7,670,493 are employed in agriculture, 4,074. 238 in professional and personal service, 2,944,876 of whom are domestic servants and laborers, while 1,810,256 are employed in trade and transportation and 3^837,112 are classed as employed in manufacturing and mining. For preseut purposes, how­ ever, the last number given should be con­ siderably reduccd. Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be conceded that there should be deducted from these which it includes 375,143 carpenters and joiners, 285,401 milliners, dressmakers ana seam­ stresses, 172,726 blacksmiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 100,473 masons, 76,214 butchers, 43,309 bakerR, 22.083 plasterers and 4391 engaged in manufacturing agri­ cultural implements, amounting in the aggregate to 1,514,023, leav­ ing 2,623,089 persons employed in such manufacturing iudustries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff. To these the appeal is made to save their employ­ ment and maintain their wages by resisting a change. There should be a disposition to answer such suggestions by the allega­ tion that they are in a minority among those who labor and therefore should fore­ go an advantage in the interest of low prices for the majority. Their compensa­ tion, as it may be affected by the operation of the tariff laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept In view, and yet with slight reflection they will not overlook the fact that 

THEY ABE CONSUMERS WITH THE BEST that they too have their own wants and those of their families to supply from their earnings, and that the price of the neces­ saries of life, as well as the amount of their wages, will regulate the measure of their welfare and comfort, but the reduc­ tion of taxation demanded should be so measured as not to necessitate or justify either the loss of employment by the work­ ing man or the lessening of his wages, and the profits still remaining to the manufac­ turer, after a necessary readjustment, should farniah no excuse for the l-*"0"v .* •. /•./'-•. 1.

Nor can the workers in manu­ factories fail to'understand that while a high tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow the payment of remunerative wages, it certainly results in a very large increase in the price of nearly all sorts of manufac­ tories, which, in almost countless forms, he needs for the use of himself and family. He receives at the desk of his employer his wages and perhaps before he reaches his home is obliged, in a purchase for fam­ ily use of an article which embraces his own labor, to return in the payment of the increase in price which the tariffs permit the hard earned compensation of many days of toil. TOE FARMER AND TIIK AGRICULTURIST, who manufacture nothing, but whp pay the increased price which the tariff imposes upon every agricultural imple­ ment, upon all he wears and upon all he uses and owns, except the increase of his flocks and herds and such things as his husbandry produces from the soil, is in­ vited to aid in maintaining the preseut situation and he is told that a high duty on imported wool is necessary for the benefit of those who have sheep to shear, in order that the price of their wool may be in­ creased. They, of course, are not re­ minded that the farmer who has no sheep is by this scheme obliged, in his purchase of clothing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow farmer, as well as to the manufacturer and merchant. Nor is any mention made of the fact that the sheep-owners themselves and their house­ holds must wear clothing and use other ariicles manufactured from the wool they sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must return their share of this increased price to the tradesman. 1 think it may be fairly assumed that a large proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers through­ out the country are found in small flocks numbering from twenty-five to fifty. The duty on the grade of imported wool which these sheep yield is lOcents each pound if of the value of 30 cents or less, aud 12 cents if of the value of more than 30 cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would be 60 or 72 cents, and they may be taken as the utmost enhancement of the price to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eigh­ teen dollars would thus represent the in­ creased price of the wool from twenty-five sheep and $36 dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep and at present values their addition would amount to about one third of its price. If upon its sale the farmer receives this or a less tariff profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with precisely that sum, which in all its changes will adhere to it until it reaches the con­ sumer when manufactured into cloth and other goods and material for use. Its cost is only increased to the extent of the farm­ er's tariff profit, but a further sum has been added for THE 

PROFIT OF THE MANUFACTURER under the operation of other tariff laws. In the meantime the day arrives when the farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen goods and material to clothe him­ self and family for winter. When he faces the tradesman for thatpurpose he discov­ ers that he is obliged not only to return in the way of increased prices the tariff profit on the wool he has sold and which then perhaps lies before him in manufactured form, but that he must add a considerable sum thereto to meet a further increase in cost caused by a tariff duty on the manu­ facture. Thus in the end he is aroused to the fact that he has paid upon a moderate purchase as a result of the tariff scheme which when he sold his wool seemed so profitable an increase in price more than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit he received upon the wool he produced and sold. When the number of farmers engaged in wool raising is compared with all the farmer in the country and the small proportion they bear to our population is considered when it is made apparent that in the case of a large part of those who own sheep, the benefit of the present tariff is illusory and above all, when it must be conceded that the increase of the cost of living caused by such tariff becomes a bur­ den upon those with moderate means, and the poor, the employed and unemployed, the sick and well and the young and old, and that it constitutes a tax which with relentless grasp is fastened upon the cloth­ ing of every man, woman and child in the land, reasons are suggested why the re­ moval or reduction of this duty should be included in a revision of our tariff laws. In speaking of increased cost to the con­ sumer of our home manufactures, resulting from a duty laid upon imported articles of the same description, the fact is not over­ looked that competition among our domes­ tic producers sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of their products below the highest limit allowed by such duty, but it is notorious that this competition is too often strangled by combinations, quite prevalent at this time and frequently called "trusts*" which have for their object the regulation of the supply and price of commodities made and sold by members of the combination. The people can hardly hope for any consideration in the opera­ tion of these selfish schemes. If, however, in the absence of such combinations a healthy and free competition reduces the price of any particular dutiable article of home production below the limit.which it might otherwise reach under tariff laws, and if with such reduced price its manu­ facture continues to thrive, it is entirely evident that ONE 

THING HAS BEEN DISCOVERED which should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxation. The neces­ sity of combination to maintain the price of any commodity to the tariff point fur­ nishes proof that some one is willing to accept lower prices for such commodity and that such prices are remunerative, and lower prices produced by competition prove the same thing. Thus where either of these conditions exist a case would seem to be presented for an easy reduc­ tion of taxation. The considerations which have been presented touching our tariff laws are intended only to euforee an earnest recommendation that surplus rev­ enues of the government be prevented by the reduction of our customs duties and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion "bj rom. tariff taxation In quarters where it is moat -i ''^x^-^SWWW^"!' yy%\ *Vf 4- n/v 1 needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor cau the presentation made of such considera­ tions be with any degree of fairness re­ garded as proof of unfriendliness toward our manufacturing interests or any lack of appreciation of their importance. These interests constitute a leading and most substantial element of our national great­ ness and furnish the proud proof of our country's progress. But if in the emer­ gency that presses upon us our manufac­ turers are asked to surrender something for the public good and to avert disaster their patriotism, as well as a grateful rec­ ognition of the advantages already offered, should leaa them'to willing co-operation. No demana is made that they shall forego all the benefits of governmental regard, but they cannot wait to be admonished of their duty as well as their enlightened self interest and safety when they are remind­ ed of the fact that the financial panic and collapse to which the present condition tends afford no greater shelter or protec­ tion to our manufactures than to our other important enterprises. An opportunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is now offered and none of us should be unmind­ ful of a time when an abused and irritated people, heedless of those who have resisted timely and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical and sweeping recti­ fication of their wrongs. The difficulty attending a wise and fair decision of our tariff laws is not underestimated. It will require on the part of congress great labor and care, and especially abroad and national contemplation of the subject and a patriotic disregard of such local and self­ ish claims as are unreasonable and recent less of the welfare of the entire country. Under our present laws more than 4,000 articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our manu­ factures and many are hardly worth atten­ tion as subjects of revenue. A consider­ able reduction can be made in the aggre­ gate, by adding them to the tree list. The taxation of luxuries presents no features of hardship, but the necessaries of life used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living in every home, should be greatly cheapened. The radical 

REDUCTION OF THE DUTIES IMPOSED UPON RAW MATERIAL used in manufactures or its free importa­ tion is, of course, an important factor in any effort to reduce the price of these necessaries. It would not only relieve them from the increased cost caused by the tariff on such material, but the manufac­ tured product being thus cheapened that part of the tariff now laid upon such pro­ duct as compensation to our manufacturers for the present price of raw material could be accordingly modified. Such a reduc­ tion or free importation would seltve be­ side to largely reduce the revenue. It is not apparent how such a change can have any injurious effect upon our manufactur­ ers. On the contrary it would appear to give them A 

BETTER CHANCE IN FOREIGN MARKETS with manufacturers of other countries who cheapen their wares by free material. Thus our people might have the opportu­ nity of extending their sales beyond the limits of home consumption, saving them from the depressive interruption in busi­ ness and the loss caused by a glutted do­ mestic market and affording their em­ ployes more certain and steady labor with its resulting quiet and contentment. The question thus imperatively presented for solution should be approached in a spirit other than partisanship and considered in the light of that regard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those intrusted with the weal of a confid­ ing people. But the obligation to declared party policy and principle is not wanting to urge prompt and effective action. Both of the great political parties now represent­ ed in the government have by repeated aud authoritative declaration condemned the condition of our laws which permit the col­ lection from the people of unnecessary revenue and have in the most solemn manner PROMISED ITH CORRECTION and neither as citizens or partisans are our countrymen in a mood to condone the del­ iberate violation of these pledges. Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not be improved by dwelling upon theories of protection and free trade. This savors too much of bandying epithets. It is a condi­ tion which confronts us, not a theory. Relief from this condition may involve a slight reduction of the advantages which we award our home productions, but the entire withdrawal of such advantages should not be contemplated. The question of free trade is absolutely prevalent aud the persistent claim made in certain quarters that all efforts to save the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are the schemes of mischievous so-called free traders and far removed from any con­ sideration for the public good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary ex­ penses of an economical operation of the government and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things can and should be done WITH SAFETY TO ALL OUR INDUSTRIES, without danger to the opportunity for the remunerative labor which our working men need, and with benefit to thein and all our people by cheaping their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. The constitution provides that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the stata of the union. It has been the custom of the executive in compliance with this provision to annually exhibit to the con­ gress at the opening of its session the gen­ eral condition of the country-and to detail with some particularity the operations of the dlgerent executive departments. It would oe especially agreeably to follow this course at the present time and to call attention to the valuable accomntshments of these departments during the last fiscal year, but I am so much impressed with the paramount Importance of the subject to which this communication has thus far been devoted that I shall forego the addi­ tion of any of these tonics and only urge upon your Immediate consideration of the T$i -5 V# -^TgiS S 1 *v I

The reports of the heads of departments which will be submitted contain full and explicit information touching the transac­ tion of business entrusted to them and such recommendations relating to legis­ lation in the public interest as they deem advisable. I ask for these reports and rec­ ommendations the deliberate examination and action of the legislative branch of the government. There are other subjects not embraced in the department reports demanding legislative consideration and which I should be glad to submit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages and as to them 1 beg leave to report prior recom­ mendations. As the law makes no pro­ vision for any report from the^department of state, a brief history of the transactions of that department, together with other matters which it may hereafter be deemed essential to command the attention of the congress, may furnish the occasion for a future communication.

OPINIONS. COMMENTS BY PROMINENT MEN. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—After the reading of the president's message in the respective houses, a correspondent interviewed a number of congressmen as to their opin­ ions oj the communication. Senator Ev arts said he was impressed with the brev­ ity of the message and that anything in the way of brevity in politics was to be commended. Senator Call—A very able document. Senator Paddock (rep.)—It is a big card for the republicans. Senator Hiscock—We can carry New York by the biggest majority if thev will give us that platform. Senator Teller—It's a remarkable mes­ sage and very weak. Senator Frye—It's a good enough plat­ form for the republicans. We want, noth­ ing better. Senator Allison—If the president means free trade, and I think he does, it will be a good enough document for the republi­ cans. Senator Chandler—I only tear the demo­ cratic party will not indorse it and will go back on it. The republicans want noth­ ing better. Senator Spooner—A free trade essay. Am glad to see them show their hand. Senator Strong—Original and character­ istic of the man. Cleveland is the strong­ est president since Jackson. Senator Eustis—It is an admirable mes­ sage and suits us. Senator Blackburn—If there's anything I don't want to be quoted on, it's this mes­ sage. Representative Ileisland (rep.)—We can defeat that doctrine by 100,000 majority in Pennsylvania. A
