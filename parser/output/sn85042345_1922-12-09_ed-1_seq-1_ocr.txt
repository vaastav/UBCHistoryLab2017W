In a vig orous message, hitting straight from th shoulder on a numbor of great domestic I.sues, President Harding went before a Joint session ot con gress this afternoon with tho most far-reaching program the adminis tration has yot offered for dealing with tho railroad situation, agricul tural relief and prohibition enforce ment. The greater part of th president's long message dealt with thl trio of national troubles and chief among his recommendations were tho fol lowing: Would Abolish Inbor Hoard Railroads: Ho suggested tho ad visability of abolishing the railway labor board as at present constitut ed and the transfer ot Its functions lo tho lnterstato commerce commio slon through tho addition of four new mombers who would constitute a "labor division;" Ho dismissed the Idea of rovtrn mont operation an already having failed and as lmnnictical. Ha suggested and indorsed tho theory that railroad strikes should bo prohibited by law.. Ho indorsed tho living wage for railway workers. Prohibition enforcement: He characterized the present enforce went as a "nation-wide scandal" and tho "most demoralizing factor ot our national lire. Will Confer With Governors. Ho announced his Intention of eummonlng to Washington at an early dato a conference of the cov entors of all tho states for a dis cussion ot tho wholo enforcement problem In tho hope that out of closer co-operation between state find federal officers may come stricter observance of the law. Ho warned thoso jrfho ovndo the prohibition law they aro undermin ing the moral fiber of the republic. Ho expressed tho belief that tho Eighteenth amendment is In the constitution to stay. He indorsed the statutory enforce ment law (tho Volstead law) but recognized tho possibility of modifi cation. Strict enforcement will re veal, ho said, whether deliberate public opinion wants modification. Ho urgently recommended the need of greater credit facilities for the farmer, extended through the nations great financial system.

WASHINGTON, Dec. S Prejl dent Harding, In his mesage to con gress today on tho "state ot tho union," spoke In part as follows: ''Members ot .tho congress: So many problems aro calling for solu tion that a recital of all ot them, In tho face of tho known limitations of a short session of congress, would j seem to lack sincerity of purpose. It j Is four years since tho World war j ended, but tho lnovltablo readjust ment of tho social and economic order Is not moro than barely be gun. Thero Is no acceptance of pre war conditions anywhero In the worfd. In a very general way hu manity harbors individual wishes to go on with war-tlmo compensations for production, with pre-war re quirements In expenditure. In short, everyone, speaking broadly, craves readjustment for everybody except himself, while there can be no Just and permanent readjustment except wnen an participate. "Tho civilization which measured Its strength of genius and tliu power ot science and tho tesources ot In dustries, In addition to testing tho limits of man power and tho cn- duranco and heroism of men and women that samo civilization Is Brought to Its sovorcst tost in restor ing a tranquil order ami committing humanity to the fitablo ways of peace. "If tho sober and deliberate ap praisal of pre-war civilization makes it seem a worthuiilo Inheritance, then with patlonceimd good cour ago It will bo preserVerr Thero never again will be precisely tho old order; Indeed, I know of no one who thinks It to bo desirable. For out of tho old order came tho war Itself, and tho new order, established nnd mndo secure, never will prumlt its rocurronce. "It Is no figure of speech to say we have come to tho test of our civilization. The world has been passing Is today passing through a great crisis. The conduct of war itself Is nctmora difficult than tho solution oTrho probloms which nec essarily follow. I anx not speaking at this moment of the problem in Its wider aspect of world rehabilitation or of International relationships. Tho reference Is to our own socinl, financial and economic probloms at home. These things are not to bo considered solely as probloms apart from all International relationship but every nation must carry on for ltsolf, clso Its International rela tionship will havo scant Importance. "Doubtless our own people havo emerged from tho World war tumult less impaired Olian most belligerent powers; probably wo have made larger progress toward reconstruc tion. Surely wo have been fortunate In diminishing unemployment and our Industrial nnd business nctlvl- tics which aro tho life blood of our material existence, havo been re stored ns in no other reconstruc tion period of like length In tho history of the world. Had wo es caped tho coal and railway strikes, which had no excuso for their be- irlnninir and less Justification for their delayed pettloment, wo should havo done infinitely hotter. I?ut labor was Insistent on holding to tho war heights and heedless forces of reaction sought the pro-war levels and both wero wrong. In tho folly ot conflict, our progress was hin dered and tho heavy cost has not yet been fully estimated. Tnero can do neither adjustment nor tho penalty of tho failure, to rc.tdjust in which all do not somehow participate. Tho railway strike nccentuateu tho difficulty of tho American farmer. Tho first distress of read justment camo to tho farmer nnd it will not be a readjustment fit to abide until ,ho Is relieved. The dis tress brought to tho farmer doc.i not nffect him alone.

Hut tho congress financial facilities which havo been built up under government aid and supervision for other commercial and Industrial enterprises. It may bo done on tho samo solid fundamen tals and mako the vitally Important agricultural Industry moro secure and it must bo done. "This congress already ban taken cognizance of tho mlstortuno which precipitate deflation brought to American agriculture. The very proof of helpfulness already given is the strongest argument for the permanent establishment of wldenod credits, heretofore temporarily e. tended through the war finance cor poration.
