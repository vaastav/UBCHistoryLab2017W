This construction prevented its application to government battle ships and other vessels built in pri vate 'shipyards and to heavy guns and armor plate contracted for and made at private establishments. The proposed act provides that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work contemplated by a con tract with tho United States in the employ of the cintractor or any sub contractor shall be required or per mitted to work mqre than eight hours a day In any one calendar day. It seems to me from the past his tory that tho government has been committed to a policy of encouraging the limitation o ftho day's work to 3 hours in all works of construction Ini tiated by Itself, and it seems to me illogical to maintain a difference be tween government work done on gov ernment soli and government work done In a private establishment, when the work is of such large dimension and involves the expenditure of much labor for a considerable period, so that the private manufacturer may adjust himself and his establishment to the special terms of employment that ho must make with his workmen for this particular job. To require, however, that every small contract of manu- ifacture entered Into by the government should be carried out by the contrae tor with men working at eight hours would be to impose an intolerable burden upon the government by limit, ing its sources of supply and excluding altogether the great majority of those who would otherwise compete for its business. The proposed act recognizes this in the exceptions which it makes to contracts. "For transportation by water or land, for tho transmission of intelli gence and for such materials or ar ticles as may usually be bought In the open market whether made to con form to particular specifications or not, or forthe purchase of supply by the government, whether manufactur. ed to conform to particular specifica tions or not." I recommend that instead of enact ing the proposed 'bill, tho meaning of which is not clear and definite and might be given a construction embar rassing to the public interest, the pro sent act be enlarged by providing that public work shall be construed to In clude not only building and work, up on public ground, but also ships, ar mor and large guns, when manufac tured In private yards or factories. One of the great difficulties in en forcing this eight-hour law is that Its application under certain emergencies becomes extremely oppressive and there is a great temptation to subor dinate officials to evade it. I think that it would be wiser to allow the President, by executive order, to de clare an emergency in special In stances In which tho limitation might not apply, and, in such cases, to per mit tho payment by tho government cf extra compensation for the time work ed each day In excess of elgh hours. I may add that my suggestions In respect to this legislation have the full concurrence of the commissioner of Labor. NEW 

YORK, December 14. After dominating tho American Sugar Re fining Company, better Known as tho Sugar Trust, for years, the Havomey er frtmlly stepped down from control tdday with the resignation of Horace Havemeyer, the son of the late H. O. Havemeyer, as practical head of tho great company. At the same time Arthur Dorner, treasurer of the company, also handed In his resignation, ana new men un affiliated with tho Havemeyer Inter ests will assume the practical man agement of the corporation's affairs. While it is not officially admitted that the recent prosecutions by the government and the petition now be fore the federal corut for a dissolu tion of the alleged trust, have any thing to do with the resignation of Mr. Havemeyer and Mr. Dorner, It Is the belief in financial circles here that this Is the main reason for the severance of the connections by tho Havemeyer family with the company. Until a meeting of the board of di rectors is held it is improbable that any official announcement will no made regarding tho successors to Havemeyer and Dorner.
