THE PRESIDENT'S. MESSAGE, Recommendations 1o Congress Concern ing Needed Legislation. WORK OF DEPARTMENTS REVIEWED.

Following is the first annual message, in part, of President Roosevelt to the Congress of the United States: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives : The Congress assembles this year un der a shadow of a groat calamity. On the sixth of September. President Me Kinlcy was shot by an anarchist while attending the Fan-American Exposi tion at Iltiffalo. and died in that city on the fourteenth of thai month. Of the last seven elected Presidents, lie is the eliird who has been murder ed, and the bare recital of this f.ict is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loval Aemricans citizens. Moreover, tue circumstances of this, the third as- sassination of an American President; have a peculiarly sinister significance. I Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history: President Lincoln falling the victim to the terrible passions aroused ' by four years of civil war. and Prcsi- . dent Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed i'iiee-secker. Presi- , dent McKinlcy was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all gov ernments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws, and who are as hos- 1 tile to the upright exponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. j The anarchist, anil especially the an- ! archist in the United States, is merely ! one type of criminal, more dangerous j than any other because he represents i the same depravity in a greater degree, The man who advocates anarchy direct ly or indirectly, in any shape or fash- ion. or the man who apologizes for an- ' archists and their deeds, makes him- j self morallv accessory to murder before the fact. ' ! I earnestly recommend to the Con- i gress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consid eration the coning to this country of anarchists or persons professing prin ciples hostile to ail governments and jus- 1 tying the murder ol those placed in authority. Such individuals as those who were not long ago gathered in open , meeting to glorify the murder of King , Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime. ' and the law should ensure their rigor ous punishment. They and those like ; them should be kept out of this country; and if found here they should be prompt- i ly deported to the country whence they came ; and far-reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those ! who stay. No matter calls more ur gently for the wisest thought of the i Congress. j The Federal courts should be given j jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the President or any ' man who by the Constitution or by . laws is in line of succession for the 1 Presidency, while the punishment for ! an unsuccessful attempt should be pro portioned to the eti'.rmity of the of- j fence against our institutions. ' Abounding Prosperity j During the last five years business confidence has been restored, and the Nation is to be congratulated because of its present ab. ninding prosperity. Such prosperity can inner be created by law alone, although ii is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any country, if tlnxl or drouth come-, human wisd nr. is powerless to acrt the calamity. Moreover, no law can guard us r.gaii:-t the conseruenses of , our own folly. The nun who are idle or credulous, the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand . but by gambling in any form, are al ways a source of menace not only to them-elves hut to others. If the bn-i- ' ness world Iom--, its head, it loses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamen tally the welfare of each citien, and . therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes ihe Nation, must rest upon individual thrift and energy, resolution and intelligence. Noth ing can take the place of this individ ual capacity; but wise legislation and honest and intelligent admhiistratio.i ; can give it the fullest scope, the largest opportunity to work to good effect. i Trusts. J The tremendous and highly complex j industrial development which went on , with ever accelerated rapidity during ! the latter half of the nineteenth cen tury brings us face to face, at the be- 1 ginning of the twentieth, with very serious social problems. The old laws, and the old customs which had almost : the binding force of law, were once quite sufficient to regulate the aconmu- ' lation and distribution of wealth. Since j the industrial change, which have so i enormously increased the productive power of mankind, they are no longer kiillicient. The growth of cities has gone on be yond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has ! meant a startling increase, not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the ! number of very large individual, and especially of very large corporate, for tunes. The creation of these great cor porate fortunes, lias not been due to the taritf nor to any other governmental I action, but to natural causes in the business world. oerating in other I countries as they operate in our own. '1 he first essential in determining how ' to deal with the great industrial combi nations is knowledge of the facts pub- ' ,)icity. In the inteiest of the public, the Government should have the right to in- I spect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate i busings. Publicity is the only sure rem- cdy which we can invoke. What further i -.., ...i;.. i. ..i ;.. ,i,. iiiin.u.ki civ iiumu in iiiv ay vi crumental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process of law. and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and com plete knowledge which may be made public to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental super vision, and full and accurate informa tion as to their operations should be made public regularly tit reasonable intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one State, always do business in many States, often doing very little business in the State where they are incorpor ated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the State laws about them: and as no State has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in prac tice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action. There fore, in the interest of the whole peo ple, the Nation should, without inter fering with the power of the States in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all cor porations doing an interstate business. This is especially true where the cor poration deives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopo listic element or tendency in its busi ness. There would be no hardship in such supervision; banks arc subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. There should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last ses sion of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense; including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine. The Parmer anj Wage-Worker. With the sole exemption of the farm ing interest, no ore matter is of such vital moment to p- r w hole people as the welfare of t' e wage-workers. If the farmer and thi wage-worker are well off, it is abseil' others will be well fore a matter for I that on the whole day in the I'nitcd fore in our history. tely certain that all iT. loo. It is there arty congratulation , ages are higher to tates than ever be- S anil far higher than .-. The standard of i in any oilier cour.tr livinir is :iKis Iiit'lirr lli.-nl ever hefonv I Kvery effort of legislator and admiuis- j trator should be bent to secure the j permanency of this condition of things ' and its improvement wherever pos- j sible. Not only must our labor be pro- tectcd by the tarilY. but it should also ; be protected so far as it is possible ; from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract, j or of those who. coming freely, yet rep resent a standard ot living, so depressed , that they can undersell our men in the j labor market and drag them to a lower j level. I regard if as necessary, with this end in view, to re-enact immedi ately the law excluding Chinese labor- : crs and to strengthen it wherever nee- ! cssary in order to make its enforce- j n'.er.t entirely effective. Our present immigration laws are , unsatisfactory. We need every honest I and efficient immigrant fitted to be- ! come an American citizen, every im- j migrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout I heart, a good head, and a resolute pur- j pose to do his duty well in every way, 1 and to bring up his children as law- i abiding anil God-fearing members of j the community. But there should be ' a comprehensive' law enacted with the ' object of working a threefold improve ment over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely i not only all persons who are known to j be believers in anarchistic principles j or members of anarchistic societies. ' but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputa- , tion. This means that we should re- j quire a more thorough system of in spection abroad and a more rigid system ! of examination at our immigration ports, the former being especially neces- I sary. The. second object of a proper immi- j gration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory ed ucation test some intelligent capacity I to appreciate American institutions I and act sanely as American citizens. ; This would not keep out all anarchists, ! for many of them belong to the intel- j ligent criminal class. Put it would do what is also in point, that is, lend to decrease the sum of ignorance, so po- j tent in producing the envy, suspicion, 1 malignant passion and hatred of order j out of which anarchistic sentiment in- citable springs. Finally, all persons I -houid be excln led who are below a certain standard of economic litne-s to enter our industrial field as competi- ' tors with American labor. There should ' be proper proof of per-oiial capacity to earn an American living and enough niorey to insur" a dec-nl start under American conditions. This v.-oiid stop the intliix of cheap labor, and the re- ! suiting competition which gives rise to so much of bitternes in American industrial lite. Both the educational and eononiic le-ts in a wise immigration law should be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social. A very close supervision should be exercised i over the steamship companies which mainly bring over the -immigrants, and they should be held to a strict account- j ability for any infraction of the law. j Present Tariff System. There is general acquiescence in our j present taritf system as a national pol- i icy. The first requisite to our prosper- ! ity is the continuity and stability of ' this economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the busi- , ness interests of the country by any ! general tariff change at this time, i lioubt. apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and ma tera! well-being. Our experience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions j of the traiff are apt to produce condi tions closely approaching panic in the ; business world. Vet it is not only pos- j sible. but eminently desirable, to com bine with the stability of our economic ' system a supplementary system of re- i ciprocal benefit and obligation with ! other nations. Such reciprocity is an j incident and result of the linn estab lishment and preservation of our pres ent economic policy. It was especially provided for in the present tariff law. Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty is to see that the protection grant ed by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for far as it can safely be done without injury I our home industries. Just how far lh. ; is, must be determined according to the individual case, remembering always that every application of our tariff pol. icy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditional upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be re duced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of eronomicc legis lation. Subject to (his proviso of ihe proper protection necessary to our industrial well-being at home, the principal of reciprocity nuist command our hearty support. The phenomenal growth of ex port trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade rtstric- I tions should be avoided. The customers to whom w dispose of our surplus pro ducts in the long run, directly or indi rectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible, be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor. American Merchant Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by the Con gress. It is discreditable to us as aNation that our merchant marine should be ut terly insignificant in comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business. We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trilling portion of our great commerce is carried on our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our ship ping interests, but it would also result in benefit to all who are interested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for American products, and would provide an auxiliary force for the Navy. Our Government should take such action as will remedy these inequali ties. The American merchant marine should bo restored to the ocean. The Gold Standard. 'The Act of March M. lwo, intended unequivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money medium in use with us, has bcea shown to be timely and judicious. The price of our Government bonds in the world's market, when compared with the price of similar obligations issued by other nations, is a flattering tribute to our public credit. This condition it is evi dently desirable to maintain. In many respects the National Bank ing Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the anking function; but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the derang ing influence of commercial crisis and fi nancial panics. Internal Taxes. 'The collections from duties on im ports and internal taxes continue to exceed the ordinary expenditure of the Government, thanks mainly to the reduced army expenditures. The ut most care should be taken not to re duce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit ; but. after providing against any such contingen cy, means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secre tary of the Treasury considers all these questions at length, and I ask your at tention to the report and recommenda tions. Strict Economy. I call strict attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid usto be niggardly in providing whatever is' actu ally necessary to our well-being, .should make us doubly careful to husband our national resources, as each of us hus bands his private resources by scrupulous avoidance of anything like reckless or wasteful expenditure. Agricu'tural Department. The Department of Agriculture dur ing the past fifteen years has steadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished results of real value in upbuilding domestic and for eign trade. It has gone into new fields, until it is now in touch with all sections of our country, and with two of the isl and groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits and vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in the several States and Territories where they may add materially to our resources. By scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops, to breeding of new : varieties of plants, to experimental ship meats, to animal industry and applied chemistry, verv practical aid has been given our farming and stockgrowing in terests. Insular Possessions. In Hawaii our aim must be to de velop the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor; we wi-li a healthy American com munity of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be end in view. shaped with this . It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Kico than as to any Slate or territory within our continental limits. The island is thiiving as never before, and it is being administered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now en joying liberty and order under the pro tection of the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and our selves. I ask the attention of the Con gress to the need of legislation concern ing the public lands of Porto Rico. In Cuba such progress has been made towards putting the independent gov ernment of the island upon a firm loot ing that before the present session of the Congress closes this will be an ac complished fact, Cuba will then start as her own mistress; and to the beauti ful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, how ever, there are weignty reasons oi mor s ... . .,:.,.... ,i, i a IV il U III llrillOIIUl llltllisi 

WIIJ HIV 1 i. ..ii i ... i ' ., policy slioiim ue neiu to nave a pecu liar application, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, in deed to the vital need, of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff du ties on Cuban imports into the United States. In ihe Philippines our problem is larger. 'They are very rich tropical is lands, inhabited by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization. Our earn est effort is to help these people upward along the stormy and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our Nation by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos them selves; and as an earnest of what we in tend to do, we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attain ed in the Philippines than ever before in their history. 'There are still troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and maraud ers, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the Old World. Encouragement, direct or in direct, to these insurrectos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hos tile Indians in the days when we still bad Indian wars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consid-v eration, but to have it understood that we will show no weaknuss lit he goes on the warpath, so we ni'ist make it evident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands of civil ization and humanity, that while we will do everything in our power for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternest . measures with the Fili pino who follows the path of the in surrccto and the ladrone. The heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the islands for their steadfast loyalty. The Maca bebes have been conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag The time has come when there should he additional legislation for the Philippines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to intro duce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throw ing them open to industrial development. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be con tinued from the Philippines to points in Asia. We should not defer n day longer than necessary the construc tion of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial, but for political and military considerations. Either the Congress should imme diately provide for the construction of a government cable, or else an ar rangement should be made by which like advantages to those accruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a pri vate cable company. No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this con tinent is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. Its import ance to the Nation is by no means lim ited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity; alone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to begin it. I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on bot'i sides in a spirit of friendliness and mu tual good will and respect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the Sen ate a treaty which if ratified, will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, and which guarantees to this Nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate, and if approved, the Congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by pro viding for the building of the canal. The Monroe Doctrine. Our people intends to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere. The Navy offers us the only means of mak ing our insistance upon the Monroe Doctrine anything but a subject of de rision to whatever nation chooses to dis regard it. We desire the peace wdiich conies as of right to the just man arm ed ; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weak ling. Army and Navy. The work of ujbuilding must be steadily continued the Navy Wo one point of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this to the honor and material welfare, and above all to l-the peace, of our Nation in the future. hethcr we desire it or not, we must henceforth recognize that we have inter national duties no less than internation al rights. Even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines and Porto Rico, cvn if we decided not to build the Isth mian Canal, we should need a thorough ly trained Navy of adequate size, or else be perpared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our Nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have war crafts to protect it. A great debt is owing from the pub lic to the men of the Army and Navy. Thev should be so treated as to enable them to'sreach the highest point of ef ficiency, so that they may be able to re spond instantly to any demand made up on them to sustain the interests of the Nation and the honor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is pro- bably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular cf any other army. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the highest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It is well worth while for the' Congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the increased value of the veteran soldier. Uprising In China. Tito nr,ner;i1 terms of llii eel lli,nin t Clf tile questions growing out of the an- ti-foreign uprising in China of 1900, having been formulated in a joint note addressed to China by the representa tives of the injured powers in Decem ber last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese Government. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipoten tiaries on the "th of last September, setting forth the measures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint note, and expressing their satisfaction therewith. It will be laid before the Congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the L'nited States, Mr. William Woodville Rockhill. St Louis Eiposltioo. I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for the St. Louis Exposition to commemo rate the One Hundredth Anniversary of the Louisiana purchase. This pur chase was tne greatest instance of ex- pansion in our history. It definitely , , . .1 decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by far the fore most power in the Western Hemis phere. It is one of three or four great landmarks in our history the great turning points in our development. The Charleston Exposition. 'The people of Charleston, with great energy and civic spirit, are carrying on an Exposition wdiich will continue throughout most of the present session of the Congress. I heartily recommend this Exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the encourage ment that can be given it. At Peace With the Nations, The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and heartfelt sorrow, to which the Govern ment gave full expression. When Pres ident McKinley died, our Nation in turn received from every quarter of the Brit ish Empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Ger many also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sym pathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assas sinated. In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of man kind ; and we firmly intend that our pol icy shall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual respect and good will '
