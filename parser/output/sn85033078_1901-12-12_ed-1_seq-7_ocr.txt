CASHIER ABSCONDS TAKES WITH HIM CURRENCY TO AMOUNT OF SIOO,OOO. WAS A TRUSTED EMPLOYEE Officials at Loss to Know the Reason —Books Examined Two Weeks Since and Found Correct —Short- age May Foot Up Even Higher Than at First Expected. San Francisco, Dec. 10. —Chief of Detectives Seymour is in receipt of a telegram from Chief of Police O. L, Sangels announcing that Henry J. Fleishman, cashier of the Farmers’ and Mechants’ bank of that city, ab sconded Saturday last with SIOO,OOO in currency and no trace of him has been discovered. Fleishman did not work Saturday. He notified the bank that he was sick. When he failed to report yesterday his accounts were gone over and the shortage discovered. The exact amount is not yet ascertained. He bad been cashier and assistant cashier of the bank for 20 years. He began work for the bank when a boy in 1875. He was under bond with a surety company for $30,000. In addition to this he had real estate and personal property in this city sufficient, in the opinion of President Heilman, to pro tect the bank from loss. The bank is ihe oldest and strongest in southern California with a capital of $500,000, a surplus of $1,000,000 and deposits of $5,500,000. The bank officers cannot account for Fleishman’s action, nor have they the slightest idea of his whereabouts. They have wired all over the United States and Mexico, and say there will be no compromise but should Fleish man be captured he will be prosecuted to the end. Two weeks ago, the of ficers say, the books were all right, which leads them to believe the money was taken within the last few days.

Feasts on 20 Pounds of Stone and a Rabbit and Then Expires. New York,, Dec. 10.—Twenty pounds of stone and a dead rabbit were found in a sea. lion which died in the New Zoo park in the Bronx. Gastritis was the technical cause of death, as shown by an autopsy under the supervision of Director Hornaday. The dead sea lion had been an inmate of the park for seven months. Each of the sea lions received 7 poirids of fish a day. Until three weeks ago this was sufficient for the now dead animal.( Suddenly its ap petite increased. Instead of 7 pounds a day. 21 pounds of fresh fish had to be given it. making its board cost $7.50 per week. Much surprise was caused by the sudden develop ment of its appetite, as there was ap parently no change in its physical condition. Mr. Hornaday cut short the supply. Then a rabbit disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Soon alter the sea lion was found floating on the surface of the pool, dead. An autopsy showed several dozen stones weighing 20 pounds? in the animal’s stomach. The surgeon also found the missing rabbit. PEOPLE OF PROMINENCE. The story that Booker T. Washing ton was refused admission to three of the leading hotels in Springfield. Mass., to which he applied for ac commodations while on his way to make a speech at Northampton, is explained there by more or less vehe ment statements to the effect that there were no vacant rooms when the applications were made. This univer sal prosperity among the hotels of the New England town is nevertheless regarded as remarkable. Miss Yu Keng. who is a daughter of the Chinese minister to France, en joys a popularity in the French capi tal that makes her an object of envy to many a young Frenchwoman mov ing in the same circle of society. Miss \ u Keng is described by a French pa per as “a charming girl who is Par isian in all but nan i e.” Minister Yu Keng has another daughter, Lizzie, and two sons, all of whom wear European costume and follow the fashions closely. The minister him self and his wife also would adopt Parisian iashions did not their gov ernment require them to wear the garb of their own country. The European tastes of the Yu Keng family in dress are ascribed to the half American par entage to Mrs. Y T u Keng, her father having been an American commercial agent in China, who married the daughter of a high Chinese official. UNIVERSITY FOR CHRISTMAS CARNEGIE OFFERS TEN MILLION TO THAT END. TOIBE GIVEN TO THE NATION Great Philanthropist Makes Giant Be quest Through President —Pro- posed Institution to Be Established at Washington and Maintained for Post Graduate Work. Washington, Dec. 10. —The Post to day will say: “President Roosevelt has received a letter from Andrew Carnegie in which the latter makes a donation of $10,000,000 to the United States. The letter will be referred to congress by the president in a special message. Carnegie’s gift is for the purpose of establishing in Washington a university for higher education. As far as his idea has been developed, it proposes a gift after the manner of the bequest of James Smithson, the Eng lishman, who gave a million dollars for the establishment and maintenance of what is now’ known as the Smith sonian institution. Smithson desired the institution founded by him to be ? factor in the “diffusion of scieptiflc knowledge.” Carnegie proposes the universit> which he Is to endow' shall be the greatest institution in the w r orld ..or the development of higher education* He has consulted President Gilman of Johns Hopkins university, President Hadley of Yale, President Eliot of Harvard, Former President WTiite of Cornell, and all the leading educators of the country. They heartily endorse his plans. The proposed university will not interfere in the least with edu cational institutions already estab lished, but will supplement them, for according to the present plan its doors will be open-only to those who desire to take a post-graduate course. Car negie also w’ants the new’ university to take the lead in original research so that the United States can event ually stand side by side with Germany if not exceed that nation in scientific development. Carnegie’s plan does not propose a national university in the sense that appropriations will be asked or need ed. The government is simply to be the trustee of the magnificent endow ment just as it administers the fund bequeathed by Smithson. He does not propose to ask from congress a single foot of the land upon which the uni versity buildings shall be constructed. The entire expense is to be borne out by his endowment. No site has yet been se’ected. It will, how’ever, neces sarily oe very large, as it is proposed to erect a series of magnificent struc tures. The amount of money to be given by Carnegie equals the sum of the present endowment fund of Harvard and Is considerably more than the invested fund of Yale. With the Catholic uni versity, Methodist university, and the proposed Carnegie university, Wash ington will be the educational center of the country. Prof. Butler Non-Committal. New York Dec. 10. —Prof. Nicholas Murray Butler acting president of the Columbia university declined to be interviewed yesterday with reference to the story that Andrew Carnegie is to give $10,000,000 in the cause of uni versity extension in this country.

Any statement purporting to come from me is without warrant.” Big Gift to Stanford U. San Francisco, Cal.. Dec. 10. —Mrs. Jane L.

SHORT SKIRTS BY LAW. Buckeye Reformer Starts Novel Cru sade. Columbus, 0., Dec. 10. —Women must wear dresses which do not come within three inches of the ground if the proposed ordinance of Council man Weichers is passed next Monday night.

Weichers is the father of what he calls the health crusade. He has just succeeded in having an anti-spitting ordinance passed, though it was by a narrow margin. Last night several men. led by Eli Hammerstein, a mem ber of the council, appeared on the streets with cuspidors suspended in front of them by straps about their necks. 

JACKSON’S CABIN. Relic of Old Hickory- Probably Will be Sent to St. Louis Fair. St. Louis, Dec. 10. —J. T. Gantt, deputy secretary of South Carolina, is in communication with officers of the world's fair, with reference to the representation of that state at the exposition of 1903. It has been sug gested that a reproduction of the cabin in which President Andrew Jackson was bom would prove an in teresting featm e. Referring to this suggestion, Mr. Gantt writes to Sec retary Reeves of the committee on state and territorial exhibits, as fol lows : “I am informed by a gentleman who visited the birthplace of this rugged old hero several years ago that little now remains of the log cabin in which he spent his boyhood days but the chimney. It is located in the Waxhaw neighborhood of Lancaster county, in this state, but so close to the line of Union county, North Carolina, that residents of the latter state claim it to be across the line. However, ail doubt that may have existed as to the nativity of General Jackson was re moved beyond question when in his famous nullification proclamation he appealed to the fellow-citizens of his ‘native state.’ The reconstruction and preservation of the old log cabin, with the original chimney and such timbers as still remain, could be easily accomplished and would prove of ex ceeding interest.” 

NEGRO BANK CLOSED. Officials Fail to Comply With State Banking Law. Philadelphia, Dec. 10. —After an existence of less than four months the First Colored bank. North, at 1024 South Twentieth street, the only one in Philadelphia managed ex clusively by negroes, has been closed by order of the state banking commis sioner on account of the failure to file a certificfiate of the good financial standing, reputation and character of the original stockholders. Becoming alarmed for the safety of a sum of money which he has on deposit, James W. Caldwell has also had John Clinton, Jr., the president, arrested on the charge of obtaining money un der false pretense. Clinton was ar raigned and held in 

SBOO bail for court. The bank was incorporated in July with a capital of $50,000 divided into shares of $2 each. Clinton declares that the institution is all right and will resume business. A business of $4,000 has been done since the bank opened, he says, and every penny of it is accounted for upon the books. There is about $l,lOO due depositors, includ ing Caldwell, he says, all of which is covered by money now in the South western National bank. WOULD DEPOSE CLARA BARTON. Two Old to Continue to Direct Red Cross Affairs. Washington, Dec. 10.—The annual meeting of the Red Cross society opens here today and there will be a heate 1 contest regarding ton, who for more > than 30 years has '"I been at the head .of the organiza tion. Her oppon ents will claim \ that she is too old \ to be a compet sent executive offi cer. The real Clara Barton. point at issue, however, is the control of the society. The friends of Miss Barton and those whom she recognizes as her best friends will seek to amend the consd tution. In fact, they will submit a new constitution and try to have It adopted. The principal change they seek to effect is to abolish the board of control and substitute for it an or dinary board of directors. The criti cism of the present by-laws is that fhe board of control is clothed with abso lute authority, which makes it embar rassing to the president and objection able to a large number of the corpora tors and associate members, who de sire a more simple and democratic form of administration. The board of control is composed of fifteen mem bers, and these members have the ab solute power of control of the business and property of the association.

NATIONAL PARK VALLEY FORGE WANTED BY THE PATRIOTIC SOCIETIES. TERRITORY ALMOST SACRED Here Washington Wintered and Here His Soldiers Left Bloody Footprints in the Snow as They Marched Away—Some Historical Facts of Interest. Philadelphia, Dec. 8. —In a very few days now occurs the an niversary of the entrance of the con tinental army into its historical winter camp at Valley Forge. Interest in the anniversary is greater this year than usual from the fact that con gress has been asked to make an ap propriation of $200,000 for the pur chase of this camp site for a national military At the last session of congress a similar bill was presented but, owing to other large appropria tions for military purposes, it was not passed. The friends of the measure have organized the Valley Forge National Park association, composed of many other associations, among them the Daughters of the American Revolu tion, the Philadelphia Chapter 11. of the Pennsylvania Society of Colonial Dames, Colonial Dames of America, the Chester County Historical Society the Brotherhood of the Union, the Junior Order of American Mechanics, the Patriotic Order Sons of America, the Sons of the Revolution, the Dela ware Historical Society, the Sons of the American Revolution, the Site and the Relic Society of Germantown. These societies will vigorously press the passage of the bill at the present session, and the officials say there is a gratifying propect of suc cess. The proposal to make a national park at Valley Forge has met with the approval of historical societies in every part of the land Many letters expressing sympathy with the movement have been re ceived, and every congressman has been asked to give his support to the measure It was on December 19. 1777, that Washington led to Valley Forge his 11,000 men, scantly clothed, poorly fed and with few tents and blankets. Here through a bitter winter these men camped and passed what is con sidered one of the most critical periods in the Revolutionary war. Valley Forge is only 20 miles from Philadelphia, but that 20 miles sep arated two armies on veiy different footings—the comfortably provided British soldiers, under General Howe safely housed amid the plenty of Philadelphia, and the raw, undis ciplined and starving American patriots. The batle of Germantown, which had been fought a short time before where every calculation of Washing ton had been thwarted, had served still more to depress the spirits of men already but ill-equipped for the cruel tasks of war. This depression of spirit and the disrupting influences at work among the army, added to the rigors of the weather, tested the mettle of the men who were allied In a cause the success of which hung in the balance. It is a literal fact that the con tinental soldiers left bloody foot prints in the snow as they dragged themselves about the camp. It is known that officers and men dragged the logs for the camp fires by mears of grape vines for want of ropes Hundreds of men died of exposure and insufficient food. In Philaelphia, on the contrary Howe and his officers and men spent the winter in revelry entertained by some of the most conspicuous of Philadelphia citizens, and entertain ing themselves wren other entertain ment. failed. There grew up a spirit of indifference to the war and hos tility to Washington, which, despite the lines of the armies did not fail to reach and to add to the discourage ments felt at Valley Forge. Yet Washington made no sign and, in deed, it was at Valley Forge that the nucleus of the real continental army was formed. To Valley Foige came Lafayette who not only brought material aid and encouragement, but | gave that pledge of French asistance which inspired the Americans with fresh hope and renewed determina tion. Dr. Steuben, another visitor, be gan that series of military drills which finally whipped the soldierr into a well-drilled army. A portion of the field of Valley Forge with the inner entrenchments, is in the possession of the state of Pennsylvania. The building where Washington had his headquarters iS owned by one of the societies formed and maintained to perpetuate rev olutionary memories an monuments The outer line of entrenchements and the only one actually occupied is still private property. The headquarters of General Weedon, the trenches of the New Yorkers, and Wayne of the Virginians under Scott and Woodford, of the Jerseymen under Maxwell the Connecticut men’s trenches and the Huntingdon redoubt are ill in private hads. So are the sites of Gen. Muh lenburg’s and the commissary gen eral's headquarters, John Moore's foit and Fort Folly. All of these sites are included in the plot of land which the United States government is asked to purchase for a military park. A 

FRANCHISE TAX Bill to Be Introduced in the Mary land Legislature. Ellicott City, Md.. Dec. 6. —Wil- liam Henry Forsythe, Jr., member elect of the house of delegates for Howard county, says: “The question much discussed of late as to the taxation of public franchises or easements is one with which the average business man is not familiar, and it is only after a careful study of our tax system that one realizes the vast amount of prop erty that is now entirely free from taxation. “A measure that I propose to intro duce in the coming session of the leg islature will be drawn on the lines of the Ford bill, recently passed by the New York assembly and signed by Governor Roosevelt. The principle of taxation which it adopts has been ad vocated by George Stewart Brown before the city council of Baltimore. “The scheme of the proposed meas ure is that all persons or corporations possessing public franchises shal l be assessed in the same proportion to their salable value as are the farm lands and city real estate. It is a simple and direct proposition and should have the support of all who are interested in fair and just tax ation. It will give relief to the over burdened taxpayer and put all in the same class, with special privileges to none. “In New York the statute taxes this class of property as real estate, and in Michigan and Illinois it is assessed like other property. If it has worked well in those states and has benefited the taxpayers, there is no reason why we in Maryland should not receive the same benefit when doing so would only be utilizing all of our resources for taxation to which we have a right to claim and the resort to which in volves no violation of sound public policy. “In order to thoroughly understand the question raised by the public fran chise or easement tax law one must have a clear concep tion of the distinction between a cor porate franchise, which is simply the I'ight to exist and do bus iness as a corporation, en joyed by all corporations alike, and the so-called public fran chise or easement, such asTTTie right acquired to construct and operate a railroad on the public streets of cities, which is a species of valuable prop erty received from the community. “A public franchise or easement is held and enjoyed by every public service corportion enjoying a right or privilege in the public highways in addition to its corporate franchise. There are numerous decisions by the courts clearly recognizing the marked distinction between the franchise to construct and operate a railroad on a public street or highway, which fran chise is absolute property, independ ent of the existence of the other cor porate franchises, such as is enjoyed by all trading companies. “The bill will have no special bear ing on corporate property as dis tinguish it from property owned by an individual. It will amend our pres ent tax law so as to include special franchises consisting of rights and easements in the public struts and highways in the enumeration of real estate subject to taxation by using the following language: ‘lncluding the value of all franchises, rights or per mission to construct, maintain or operate public utilities in, under or above, on or through the streets, high ways or other public places.’ “The proposed bill does not change the plan or scheme of the present tax law; it simply includes in the real property subject to taxation the in tangible public franchise, and there by adds to the list of taxable real estate vast properties now exempt. It does not create a single new tax official, but the valuation of the new property brought in by it will be made by the local and state boards as now provided by law. The bill in terests and affects the people of the entire state, because the taxable basis of the counties and the cities where such public franchises are operated would not only be largely increased, but the state would also collect her full share of the proceeds, which would go toward the reduction of the state tax. “Summed up, therefore, the bill will simply provide that the privilege of a private citizen (personal or corporate) to use real estate belonging to the public, such as water fronts, parks and streets, should be considered as real estate at the locality where such is used and the value of such privilege be included in the local assessment against such individual of his taxable real estate to the end that such property shall be assessed and taxed for state, county and municipal pur poses as are the farm and cit" home stead.”
