Washington, Hoc. 4.?Tho following is an abstract of President Cleveland's rnosBago to Congress, which was read before both bodies to-day. The mes? sage In full contains about 20,000 words: The constitutional du*y, which re? quires the President from time to time to give to tho Congress information of the stato of the Union, and recommond to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, is fittingly entorod upon by commending to the Congress a caroful examination of the detailed statements and well supported recommendations contained in tho report of trie heads of depart? ments, who aro chiefly charged with the executive work of the Government, In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with its pur? pose. 1 shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these departmental reports by tho mention of such execu tivo business and incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recom? mendations as appear to be at this par? ticular time appropriate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during tho past year boon entirely free from perplexity, no em? barrassing situation remains tuat will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice, which, joi?ed with con? sistent drinnodS, characterise a truly American foreign policy. Kelul Idiih With Soul h American Countries. My predecessor having accepted tho oiliee of arbitrator of the long standing missions beyond any dispute tendered to tho President by tho Argontino Re? public and Brazil. It has boon my agreeable duty to receive tho special envoys e-jmrnissioned by those states to lay before me evidence and arguments in beualf of their respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of I'.razil found tho United States alert to watch the interests of our citizens in that country with which we carry on important commerce. Sev? eral vossols of our now navy aro now, and for some time have b: on, stationed at Rio do Janeiro. The struggle boing betwoen the established government which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly rela? tions and certain of tue navy employ? ing the vessels of their command in at? tack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that tbe lnsurgants can reasonably claim recognition as bolligerants Thus far tbe position of our Government has boon that of an attentive but impartial observer of tho unfortunate conflict. The convention between our govern? ment and Chile, having for its objc ct the settlement and adjustment of the de? mands of the two countries against each other, has boon made elTectivo by tbe organization of the claims com? mission provided for. Tho vexatious question of so-called legation asylum for offenders against tho State and its laws was presented anew in Chile by tho unauthorized action of tho late United States minister in receiving into his ofllcial residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revolu? tion, and against whom criminal charges woro pending growing out of a former abortive disturbance A temperato de? mand having been made by the Cbiloan government for the correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned, tho minister was instructed no longor to harbor the offenders. The Geary ICxcIuslon Act. Upon tho deary act tho Prosidont says: It is belioved that under the recent amedmont of tho act extending the time for registration the Chinese laborors thereto ontitlcd, who desiro to reside in this country, will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may to a great dogroo be averted. Costa Rica has latoly testified its friendliness by surrendering to tho United States in the absence of a con? vention of extradition, but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality a notod fugitive from justice. It is trusted that tho negotiations of a treaty with the country to meet recurring cases of this kind will soon bo accom? plished. Our relations with tho Fronch re? public continue to be intimate and cor? dial I sincerely hope that the extra? dition treaty with that country, as amended by the Senato, will soon bo in operation While occasional ques? tions affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth have arisen in our intercourse with Germany, our relations with that country continue satisfactory. Tho quostions alfectlng our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness. Upon the Nicaraguan canal matter the President says: That canal com pany has, unfortunately, become finan? cially seriously oubarrassed, but a gen ? rous treatment has been extended it by the government of Nicaragua. The United States aro especially interested in the successful achievement of the vast undc rtaking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinctively American auspices and its enjoyment assured not only to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our Atlantic and Pacittc seaboards, but to the ships of the worid in the interest of clviliza fOKE, VA., TU KS DAY Ition is a proposition which in my judg ment d;cs not admit of question. \ The reproduced ciravel, Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent, to tho Colum? bian Exposition, has been presented to the United Slates in token of amity and in commemoration of tho event it was designed to celebrate. I recommend that, in accepting thi< Rift, Cjngross make grateful recognition of thesircoto friondehip which prompted it. Our ltelatlou* With Hawaii. It is hardly neec-sary for me to stato that the questions arising from our re? lations with Hawaii havo caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to installa? tion of the present administration tho existing government of Hawaii bad beon suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had bntm negotiated be twoen tho provisional government of tho islands and tno Unltod States and sub mitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examina? tion, and disatched Hon. Jamos U. Hlount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an im? partial investigation of the circum stances attending tho chaneo of gov ornment, and all of the conditions bear? ing upon tho subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive exami? nation, Mr. Hlount submitted to mo bis report showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government, and through tho intimida? tion caused by the presence of an armed naval forco of the United States which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts dovelupod it seemed to mo that tho only honorable course for our Govornmont to pursuo was to undo the wrong that bad been done by those representing us and to re&tero as far as practicable the status existing at tho time of our forcible intervention With a view of accomplishing this result; within the constitutional limits of oxecutivo power and recognizing all our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received approoriato instructions to that end. Taus far no information of tho accomplishment of any definite re? sults have boon received from him. Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will bo promptly sent to the Congress, together with all other information at hand, accompanied by a special executive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of tho case and presenting a history of all tho material events leading up to tho present sltua tlon. Secretary CarliHle'N lteport. The Secretary of the Treasury reports that the receipts of tho Government from all sources during tho fiscal year onded June 30, 1893, amounted to $1(51,716.0-1 and its expenditures to 8450,374,074.20 There was collocted from customs 8205,855,016 7.3 and from internal revenue 8101,037,(133.C3. Out dutiable imports amounted to $421, 850,711, an increase of 852,453,007 over the preceding year and Importations free of duty amounted to 8444,544,211, a decrease from the preceding year of 813,455,447. Internal receipts extended those of the preceding year by 87,147, 440.32. The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the Government, amounting to 8108,080,844, and exceeding tho amount exported during tho preceding year by 858,405.517. The sum paid from the Treasury for sugar bounty was 81,375,130.88, an increase over tho proceding year of 82,033,053.00. It is estimated, upon the basis of present rovenuo laws, that the receipts of tho Government for tho year ending June 30, 1S04, will be 8430,121,365.38 and its expenditures 8458.121,301.38, resulting in a deficiency of 828,000,000. Tho purchase of silvor under tho law of July 14, isno, during tho last fiscal year aggregated 51,008,102.50 fine ounces, which cost 845,531,374 53. Tho total amoi.nt of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until tho repeal of its purchasing clauso on tho first of November, 1803, was 168,674,590.46 fine ounces, which cost 8155,030,040 S4. Between tho first day of March, 1873, and tho first day of November, 1S03, the Govornmont pur? chased, under all laws, 503,003,717 fine ounces of silvor at a cost of 8510,022, 04s Tho silver dollars that have beon coined under the act of July 14, 1S0O, number 30,087,285. Tho seigniorage arising from such coinage was S6.077, 088 30, leaving on hand in the mints 140,000,760 fino ounces of silver, which cost 8120,758,218. One hundred and nineteen national banks woro organizod during tho year ending October 31, 1803, with a capital of 811,230,000. Forty six wont into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of tho suspended banks were insolvent; eighty six resumed businoss and seven remain in tbo hands of bank oxaminers with prospects of spoody resumption. The Itepeal or Ptirchailne Clause. The recent repeal of tho provision of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion by tho Government as a feature of our monetary scheme has mado an entire change in the complotion of eur currency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will bo most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at this titro pre? cisely what conditions will be brought about by the change, or what, if any. supplementary legislation may, in tho H?hl of such conditions, appear to be essontial or expedient Of course, aftor the recent financial perturbation, time is nocessary for tho ro establishmont of business confidence. When, however, through this restorod confidonco tho money which has been fricrhtonod into hoarding places Is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safo path loading? to a permanently sound currency. In these circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, Instead of being injurious, will increase tho probability of wise action. Con11nlicit OB pace 4. OK E

Washington', Dec. 4?At the outset of the proceedings the new leaders of the Senate in the changed relations of parties came immediately to the front. The echo of their chaplain's "Amen" had scarcely died away before Cockrell, chairman of the committee of appropria? tions. wa9 on his feet to move t'ao cus? tomary resolution to notify the House that the Senate was ready for business. Sherman took the lead on the other side of the chamber by suggesting that a call of the roll was first in order. This point beirjir admitted to b? $11 taken, the clerk called the r. .. and fifty six members answered to l It names. Other Senators subsfc.iuotitly en.ered the chamber, making fifty nine present out of a total of oighty-Sve (three vacancies). McPhorson and Sherman were desig? nated as niombors of a joint carntuittee of the Sonate and House to wait upon tbo President and notify him of the organization of both bodios. Then, upon motion'of Harris, tho Senate took a recess of cne hour. When the Senate again resumed its session McPhorson announced the intention of the Presi? dent to immediately communicate to both House- of Congress "a mosaago in writing." Assistant Private Secretary I mien emerged from tho cloak room, where ho had been in seclusion for noarly ten min? utes and a doorkeeper announced. '-A message from tho President o: tho 1' nlted States.'" Secretary Cox immediately entered upon its reading. There was a general air of respectful attention manifested on both sides of tho Senate. As the reading of the mejsago proceeded and it was found to be so far different '"rom what the high strung expectation had anticipated, tue interest manifested in its contents perceptibly diminished Tho reading progressed quietly and uneventfully until tho end, but Vaen Dolph rose and inquired whether tho the copies of the message which had been laid upon the desk of tho Senators were the samo as that from which the Secrotary had read. He was prompted to do this because he noticed that in tho reading no reference was uiada to Hawaiian affairs or to any of tho matter upon page 9 of the printed message. The omission having thus been called to the attention of the Senate tho Vice .Prosident directed tho secretary to real the page, which was done. The point of Oolph's Inquiry was mado clear then, for he immediately gave notice that to-morrow after tho morning hour he should ask the Senate to indulge him in a few remarks o:i that point of the message which referred to 11 awaii. A number of reports wore road and a large number of bills and resolutions wero introduced and referred to appro? priate committees. A message* was re? ceived from the House announcing the death of Charles O'Nolll and William Lilly, late representatives from Penn? sylvania. Caneron otforod resolutions exprossivo of the sorrow of the Sonata which were adopted, and as a further mark of respect tho Senate at 3:?S ad? journed. The house was called to orior promptly at noon, and 342 mombors answered to their names. During the roll call a message was received 'rom the Senate announcing tho organization of that body. On motion of Wilson iW. Va ) tho following committee was appointed to wait upon the President: Wilson (W. Va.), Outhwaito and Burrows. Various executive documents were read by title and roforrod to commit? tees. Sayres offered a joint resolution providing for tho appointment and pay? ment of a sufficient number of deputy collectors of internal revenue to carry mto effect the Chinese exlusion act. The resolution went over under objec? tion. Hines i Pa., Dem.) offered a resolution asking that a committee of live mom? bors of tho Hoi.be be appointed to in? vestigate the existing strike upon tuo Lob ig n Valley railroad, the alleged employment of incouipetont workmen and the failure to promptly transmit tho United States mails. Objection was made to its presont consideration The objection being withdrawn to tho jint resolution olfered by Sayres providing for additional dopity collectors of in? ternational revenue, it was passed with? out a division. Kichardoon. Tennessee, olfered a res? olution providing that hereafter no bills shall bo engrossed until passed by the House, which led to considerable dis? cussion and tlnal objection. At 1J:*>5 the House took a recess for fifteen minutes but no auen.pt was made to resume business until the com? mittee appointed to wait upon the Presi? dent made us appoarance. The clock Indicated I.S5 when Wilson, on behalf of the committee, reporttd that the President had informed them that he would communicate with the House in w ri ting.
