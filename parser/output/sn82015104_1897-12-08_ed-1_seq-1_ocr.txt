Criticises President McKiniey's Policy Toward the island. Asserts That the Decree of Antono inony by the Queen Regent, Unsupported by the Cortes, Is Illegal, and Will Result in. No Good to the Cubans. 

MOBILE (Ala.), Dec. 7.—ESC-Minteter to Spain. Hon. Hannis Taylor, gives out the following: "The Associated Brees has requested me to express my views as to that part of the President's message which re lates to the Cuban question. Putting aside the irrelevant matter by which it is encumbered, the substance of the only recommendation made by the Ex ecutive to Congress upon this subject is that this Government cannot venture to do anything to put an end to the in human strife, which, during the last three years, has reduced the island al most to a desert, because there is a prospect of a settlement between the combatants upon the basis of a so called plan of autonomy lately put forth by the Sagasta Ministry. "I believe Congress should firmly and scornfully reject such a policy of irres- j dutlon and non-action, because the as- j sumption upon which it is founded is I an empty illusion. The vital question at issue has not been touched by the revolutionary effort of Sagasta to end > the war by ns of a craftily incom- , plete proposition that carries with it no constitutional guarantee whatever. All i who are familiar with the Spanish law know that a valid grant of an autono mous colonial system that involves not only the repeal of all existing laws on that subject, but also the transfer of the control of a large part of the na tional revenues of Spain to a colonial Legislature, cannot be made except by an Act passed by both Houses of the Cortes, and approved by the Queen Re pent. The effort just made to secure that result by a mere royal decree, un supported by parliamentary action, has, therefore, been justly denied by Rome ro Robledo, late Minister of Justice, as a purely revolutionary proceeding in de fiance of the Constitution. 'In one particular the Cabinets at Washington and Madrid are in identi cally the same situation. Both are striving with all their might either to defy or circumvent the national will as embodied in their respective Legisla tures. "But even if the Sagasta plan pos sessed constitutional validity, a careful inspection of its artful terms must re veal the fact that, like the pretentious sham put forth hy Canovas. it contains two cardinal prov:s> p that would enable the home Government to reduce the Whole scheme at any moment to zero. ! The autocrat of Cuba has ever been i the Governor-General, and th* present plan contemplates his continuance as such, with full peewer to crush by veto any and every act of the colonial Leg islature "I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere that the primary cause o.' the endless conflict is economic, and that , difficulty can never be removed until j Cuba is independent, or possessed of an fnsnlT Parliament that can regulate! her own affairs. "At the end of three years of whole- j pale destruction, provoked by Spain i through unprecedented political and ; economic oppression, that has brought death and famine to hundreds of thou- SSIlrtS, the Spanish crown at last con fesses that the Cubans are right, and their wrongs should now be r<-dressed by a generous and genuine Government Of home rule. When the proffered scheme is examined it is found to be not only indefinite and illegal, but abso lutely wanting in sincerity upon the two vital points at Issuance, Such proposal has been extorted by the re sults of a struggle that has so com pletely broken the military and finan cial power of Spain that a conquest of the island is now hopeless. After ex pending SOOjOOO.OOO of dollars, and af ter sending over the s a 800,000 so!-! diers. Spain has a lighting force in the island of less than 7<M«>o, while the revolutionary army, now In possession of the greater part of the country, numbers aiout 50,000. "It is generally understood that a de liberate conspiracy to thwart the erhl of the nation is to be carried out through an appeal to the Speaker of the House <>f Representatives, who Is ex-; pected to so manipulate its rules as to prevent the passage of the pending bel ligerency resolution, which the Senate Its already approved. The House of Representatives is either to be muz- Bled, or called Oh to declare that tbis revolutionary Government which has virtually crushed the power of Spain In Cuba", has no such de facto existence as will authorize a recognition of war between the contending parties." 

HAVANA PRESS COMMENT. HAVANA Dec 7.—"El Dlario de la Marina," commenting upon President ICcKinl .yv nessage to Congress, says: "It contains impressive declarations calculated to strengthen were that necessary, the Spanish cause in the inland of Cuba, v will dishearten the Separatists.

RECORD-UNION. to show that the United States would be justified in assuming another atti tude in certain contingencies in the future. Such declarations may be in tended, as they probably are, to con sole the jingoes for the failure, but there is not a Spaniard who will not show his indignation at all such sug gestions. "Spain, in any event, will repel any demonstration looking to the interven tion of a foreign State in affairs abso lutely her own; and the United States shall never, under any consideration, take even an indirect part in the set tlement of our own particular con cerns." "El Pais," the organ of the autono mists, thinks the message very favor able to the interests of Cuba, and be lieves the attitude President McKinley has assumed will "calm the fury of the partisans of independence." It adds: "The radical chansre in Spanish policy, the establishment of autonomy ami the release of political prisoners, is working a rapid and most Surprising transformation. It demon strates that Spain while resolved to maintain her sovereignty at any cost, to put down the rebellion and to de stroy the forces that support it, will use also the practical arguments that must appeal to the sympathy of the American people." 

GREENBACKS AND BANK NOTES legislation to Come From Ways and Means Committee. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The Ways and Means Committee held a meeting this morning, at which a resolution was agreed upon for the distribution of the President's message to the various committees having jurisdiction. In a large measure the reference of the several questions dealt with in the message is formal, and the jurisdiction of the committee is beyond question, but it was very significant that the President's recommendations with re gard to the currency and the retire ment of the greenbacks were divided. Only those matters strictly relating to banking and currency are to go to that committee, by the terms of the resolu tion. The question of retiring the greenbacks and of the reduction of the tax on national bank notes is to go to the Ways and Means Committee. This indicates that if any legislation is to be proposed in line with the Pres ident's recommendations it will come from the Ways and Means, and not from the Banking and Currency Com mittee. Murderer Hill's Appeal Dismissed. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—ln the United States Supreme Court the case of Benjamin L. Hill was dismissed, be cau:->e he failed to have the record printed. Hill is under sentence of death for murder in California, and he ap pealed from the decision of a local Fed eral court, refusing him a writ of ha beas corpus. To-day's action will have the effect of leaving the case in the hands of the State authorities. A French Expedition Massacred. BRUSSELS, Dec. 7.—The "Mouve ant <.vograjhique" to-day announces that it learns that a French expedi tion under Major Marohand, while on its way to th* Nile, had been massa cred near Dahrenghasa, The surviv ors of the party, it is added, retreated to Borneo. CHINESE GOVERNMENT DEFIANT. WILL NOT ALLOW GERMANS REMAIN AT KIAOCHU. But Is Willing to Pay an Indemni ty for the Murder of the Missionaries. PEKING. Dec. 7.—The Chinese Gov ernment has caused it to be made known that up to the time of the Ger man occupation of Kiaochou Bay no claim was made by Germany for rep aration as a result of the murder of the two missionaries, Nies and Hennle, and thct there were no other differ ences between the two Governments. Consequently, the Government etßcials point out that the missionary ques tion is regarded as a pretext to obtain a naval station which it is shown Ger many has long coveted. The Chinese Government, it is said, in conclusion, will never consent to the Germans remaining at Kiaochou Bay, as there presence there deprives China of a harbor which, since the war with Japan, has been regarded as the most suitable naval base of operations, BERLIN, Dec. 7.—Emperor William has ordered the number of volunteers for the China expedition to be in creased to 1,000 men.

SACRAMENTO, WEDNESDAY MOBNTXG, DECEMBER S, 1897.—EIGI1T PAGES. PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS. A Flood of Bills Introduced Yester day in the Senate. The First Provided for Gilding the Statue on the Dome of the Capitol. Lively Skirmish in the Honse Over the Question of Distributing the President's Message to the Various Committees Clothed With Jurisdiction Over the Subjects Dealt With. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—A new member, in H. D. S. Money of Missis sippi, w-as introduced in the Senate to-day, and after some brief criticism of the form of his credentials, the oath of office was administered to him. During the session 108 bills, many of which were private pension meas ures, were introduced, in addition to several joint resolutions and some Sen ate resolutions. An interesting contest for precedence In considering Lodge's immigration bill und the proposed legislation to confer authority upon the President to act for the protection of the Government's interest at the sale of the Kansas Pa cific was pending at the close of the session. The probability is that it will be amicably arranged before the Senate convenes to-morrow. The invocation at the opening of the Senate to-day was delivered by Rev. Charles A. Berry of Wolverhampton, England. He prayed that the Almighty might take into His care all the inter ests cf the nation, that from this na tion may emanate such feelings of brotherhood as would be a blessing to all mankind. Walthall f Mississippi presented the credeotiaJe of Hon. H. S. Money of BftsatSstftfri, to succeed the late Sena tor . • r£& The Senator's credentials read thai be should have and hold such office unti. authority should be "re voked by competent authority." Senators Chandler of New Hamp shire and Halo or Massachusetts stated that they were not in constitutional form, but raised no objection to the Senator bei g sworn in, which was d-me, afb-r Senators Walthall, Allen and T< - hi a characterized the ob jections as- -clinical. A fVood o I ills and joint resolutions was poured into the Senate, Morrill, the venerable Senator from Vermont, having the distinction of introducing the first, providing for the "gilding of the statuo of liberty on the dome of the capitol." Among the bills introduced, the greater number of which pere pension bills, was one by Mr. Quay of Penn sylvania for the relief of the children of a soldier of the revolution. Pettigrew of South Dakota secured the passage of a resolution calling upon the Interstate Commerce Commis sion to furnish th" 3 - Senate a list of the railroad companies which have com plied wholly, in part, or not at all, with the law of Congress providing that satety appliances be fixed to rail road cars. Th> lesolution calls for the total Dumber of persons killed by the rail roads during the past year. The contest between the friends of the immigration bill and those who fa vor prompt action with reference to the sale of the Kansas Pacific developed at thus juncture. Lodge of Massachusetts moved to take up the immigration bill and pro ceed v.ith its consideration. As soon as the import of the motion was realised, Gear of lowa was on his feet with an objection. Ix>dge called attention to the fact that he had made a motion to take up the immigration bill, and had not ask ed unanimous consent for its consider ation. G.ar adverted to the importance of giving prompt attention to the part of the President's message in which Mr. McKinley had asked that Congress Confer upon the Executive by legisla tion full power to buy in the Kansas Pacific Railroad. He said he would introduce a reso lution conferring tipon the Executive the authority re-quested, and he hoped that neither the immigration hill, to which he was entirely friemdly. nor anything else would be permitted to in terfere with prompt consideration of that proposed legislation. Morgan of Alabama expressed his gratification that the President had re quested Congress to confer upon the Executive power to act at the sale of the Kansas Pacific Road in such a maimer as would best protect the in tercuts of the Government. <»n request Of Carter of Montana, Chairman of the Census Committee, the measure providing for the Federal cen sus of 

IJKK>. reported to the Senate at tlie last session, was recommitted to the committee. Turpie of Indiana asked that at 3 o'clock Friday, December 17th, exer cises he held in memory of the Hon. "U"illiam S. Holman. late Representative In Congress from Indiana. The order was made. Tillman presented a resolution, which Sas adopted, fixing Tuesday, January ISth. at 2 p. m., as a time for me morial services for the late Joseph H. Burl, a Senator from South Carolina. Lodge then gave notice that he would call up the immigration bill at the con clusion of the present unfinished busi- Gear announced promptly that he would contest that motion. Allison, in the hope, as he said, that the gentlemen might reach an amicable understanding, moved, at 1:35 p. m.. that the Senate adjourn, and the mo tion prevailed. IX THE 

HOUSE, WASHINGTON, Pec. 7.—The session of the HOUM to-day. although it lasted but two hours, witnessed a very lively skirmish over the question of dis tributing the President's message to the various committees clothed with jurisdiction over the subjects dealt with. The conflict of authority came between the Ways and Means Commit tee and the Banking and Currency Committee. The battle raged all along the line. During the debate General Grosvenor of Ohio fired the first gun against the civil service law% and this also brought the friends and enemies of that meas ure into action. Johnson of Indiana, in a ringing warning, declared if a bill to emascu late the civil service law were pass* d it would meet the Presidential veto. When the House met to-day it set tled down to the customary routine. Rev, Henry Couden, the regular Chap lain, who delivered the invocation, asked for the divine blessing upon the President in his hour of trial and anxiety. After the reading of the journal leave was asked by several of the more im portant committees to sit during the sessions of the House, and for the printing of documents for the use of the committees. These were the cus tomary requests incident to the first week of the session, and were granteel. The President's message transmitting the report of the special commission on the Paris International Exposition in 1900, and recommending a liberal appropriation for our representation at the exposition, was laid before the House. Dingley, from the Committee on j "Ways and Means, then presented a res j olution adopted by that committee for j distribution of the President's message to the several committees having ju i risdiction of various subjects treated. Walker (R.) of Massachusetts, Chair ■ man of the Banking and Currency Committee, asked for a rereading of the I portion of the resolution giving the Ways and Means Committee jurisdic tion of all the portions relating to the revenues, the national finances, the | public debt and the preservation of the j public credit. Before the debate, which lasted over an hour, had been concluded, the House was plunged into a debate on the currency problem. Walker, after the reading of the res olution, asked with some heat what was left to his committee. Dingley replied that all matters re lating to banking and currency under the resolution would go to the Banking and Currency Committee. "There seems to be a decided con flict of opinion as to what matters re fer to banking and currency," exclaim ed Walker, rather sharply. Dingley protested that the language of the resolution was identical with that of former resolutions on the same subject, but he was immediately bom barded with questions as to the prac tical effect of the resolution's language. Bailey of Texas, the minority leader, wanted to know specifically whether a measure to effectuate the recommenda tions of the President on the currency would go to the Ways and Means or the Currency Committee. Dingley avoided a direct response-. 'if it is proposed to retire the green backs in the manner recommended by the President,-where would it go." &sk ed Bailey. Johnson (R.) of Indiana pressed Dingley along the same line. "I would leave the determination oi that question to the Speaker," at last replied Dingley. The House laughed. "It is to avoid this very thing," ex claimed Johnson, "that I desire this question to be made clear now. Does the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee think a bill embodying the principle of the President's recom mendation affects the redemption fund?" "I think it does," replied Dingley. "Then the gentleman indirectly an swers our question," exclaimed John son. By this time, it being apparent that debate would be required to dispose of the question at issue, Dingley and Bailey arranged for thirty minutes on a side. Walker then got the floor and indig nantly protested that if the questions relating to our legal tender money, which lay at the very foundation of our currency and banking laws, were to come under the jurisdiction cf the Ways and Means Committee, the Com mittee on Banking and Currency might as well be dissolved. Cox (D.) of Tennessee, the senior Democratic member of the Currency Committee, seconded the protest of Walker. Wheeler (D.) of Alabama at this point got the floor and used a few min utes in a plea for a Government armor plate plant in Alabama. He was followed by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, who diverted the whole course of the debate by an attack on the civil service law, which was several times enthusiastically applauded both by members on the floor and spectators in the galleries. Brossius (R.) of Pennsylvania, he Chairman of the Committc* on Civil Service, defended the law and the, l'r.-sid.-nt's Interpretation of it. He thought any attempt to legislate upon the question must be regarded as an indignity to the executive. Johnson (R.) of Indiana, after some opening remarks about the stupen dous folly of appointing a bimetallic commission to roll over Europe, mads a strong speech in defense of the civil service law. Cochrane (D.) of Missouri, in a sa tirical speech, spoke of the injustice of turning over a subject, which Walk er had freely admitted he knew all about, to Dinghy, who had fathered a tariff bill that had already produced a 140,000,000 deficit. Bland (D.) of Missouri averred that it was well understood that nothing would be done with t|»e currency prob lem, and Bodine (D.) of Missouri al leged that the civil service law was a humbug. The West and South opp< seb. The latter gave some amusing illus trations of its operations and caused a laugh by the statement that Mr. Cleveland had been some time in the White House before he discovered that the United Stab-s was not bounded on the west by the Allegheny Mountains. During the progress of the debate Walker and Johnson had consulted With Dingley, and a modification of the resolution of distribution was agreed upon. It struck out the words "The national finances, the public debt, the preservation of the Government cred it." and gave the Ways and Means Committee jurisdiction over all mat ters in the message relating "To the revenue, the bonded debt of the Unit ed States and the treaties of the Unit ed States affecting the revenue." When this amendment was presented the opposition withdrew and the reso lution was adopted without division. The House then, at 2 o'clock, ad journed. 

SUMMARY JUSTICE TO A MURDERER. An Angry Mob Avenges the Killing of Hans Anderson. Adam liber Forcibly Taken From the Genoa Jail and Lynched. Dragged Through the Streets in an Almost Nude Condition to a Place Half a Mile Distant From Town, Strung Up to a Tree and His Body Riddled With Bullets —The Sheriff Forced to Accom pany the Mob and Watch the Execution. CARSON, Dec. 7. —One of the most horrible lynchings ever known in Ne vada occurred at Genoa, fourteen miles from here, at 2 o'clock this morning. ! Adam Über, who last week shot and , killed Hans Anderson in a Gardner | ville saloon, was hanged by an angry I mob of masked men to a cottonwood : tree half a mile distant from the jail, j When taken from his cell the victim had nothing on but a shirt. This was I turn off by the lynchers, and the nude b ly left dangling in the air for six j hours. As the body was being pulled up the mob riddled it with bullets. I When satisfied that the man was dead, I the vigilantes dispersed and returned to their homes. At the hour above mentioned the leader of the mob presented himself at a side window of the County Jail, and calling to Sheriff BrocMiss, stated that the Gardnerville Constable had arrived with a prisoner he wished to have !< eked op. The Sheriff was some time in responding, and the mob, becoming impatient at he delay, battereel down the door of the Recorder's oflice with a sledge hammer, and entered the room where the Sheriff and a Constable were. After some resistance both officers were disarmed and placed under a guard of six men armed with shot guns. The prisoner w as then awakened. He fought bard with a chair, but was soon overpowered. He cried for mercy, but was silenced with a gag, and after be ing bound was dragged through the streets out of the city and to a place half a mile distant, where the crowd halted. The Sheriff and Constable were forced to accompany the mob, and still under a strong guard, watched the execu tion. A top" was placed about Über's neck, and he was given one minute in which to pray. Before the time had expired twenty-five pair of arms tugged at the rope, and he was lifted into the air. Firing at his body then commenced, ! and when their purpose seemed to j have been accomplished, the lynchers ! dispersed. j Über was beaten and bruised while ! being dragged to the scene of death. The prisoner was about to receive a fair trial, and just punishment for the crime committed. The preliminary examination was held last week, and the Grand Jury had found an indict ment. A number of witnesses would ■ have been brought into court to prove ! that Über w r ould have been assaulted by Anderson before the shooting. Über has a millionaire uncle, Henry in Pittsburg, Pa,, and it is thought that the members of the mob may be brought to justice. LOCKED THE JAILER IN. Two Prisoners Make Their Escape From Jail at Salinas. SAN JOSE, Dec. 7.—Sheriff Matthews lof Monterey County was here to-day i trailing two prisoners who escaped from j the jail at Salinas last night. One of j them is J. Johnson and the other John J Doe, both being held for trial on a j charge of burglary. i According to the statements, the men escaped in an esay and ingenious way. | Last night about 7 o'clock the jailer went into the tank on some business. The solid steel door was standing open. I and a "trusty" was left outside at the i grate door, which was locked, but the \ key in the door. Johnson saw this, j and with a quick move unlocked the 1 door and "bluffed" the trusty. He ! and his companion jumped out, locked ' the door, threw the key away, and I escaped before anything could be done 'to stop them. In the meantime Deputy Sheriff Nes bitt and Jailer Duckworth were locked in the tank, and they had to send for ! Sheriff Matthews to come and release ! them. So far nothing has been seen ;of the escapes. JURY BRIBING. Serious Charges Against a Young Man of Los Angeles. LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.—Frank O.
