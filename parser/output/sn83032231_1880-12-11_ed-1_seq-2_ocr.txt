('., Dec. 4, 18S0 The report of the Secretory of the Interior, which has jutt been made public is a docu meut ofgieul interest in resiect to matters of national imiortance. The most impor tant topic of general interest is, of courso the Indian question. The central Idea of tlio Secretary's policy Is the abandonment of tho rebervation Bystem and the granting ofscverality titles to the Indians, inalienable lor about one generation. Tho four years of his administration have been marked by noteworthy progress in the education of In ditins at a disunce from the camps, the cx tension- of law over the Indian reservation and lUetrnlnlugof Indians in various trades and as policemen and as freighters. The Secretary predicts from present Indications that the Indian problem will be solved sooner than Is generally supwsed. Th consolidation ol tho geological Buryoy3, the reorganization of the land system, the pre vention of speculative depredations on tim ber lands, as fai-us tho appropriations would permit, an Increase of working efficiency and an improvement in the moral tone i the department havo been effected in the last four year years. According to tho report of the Postmaster General, there aro 00,470 employes in tlio Po3t-OCfico Department. In other words, tho Fost-Offico army is moro than twice as largo as the army proper. And whero on jwrson thinks of the soldier, ten persons think of the jKistinau. The complete change wrought by modern civilization in tl modes of regarding social functions has no moro striking illustration tlibn is afforded by the growth of tho postal service and the respect with which it Is regarded. Superintendent of tho Ceusus, Walker lias submitted his annual report to the Secretary of the Iuterior. lie says that although the work of taking the tenth census is substan tially complete (returns having been receiv ed from all but seven of the total number of $1,265 enumeration districts), it will pro bably be two or threo weeks before tho office will bo able to present complete statistics of the population of tlio country. During the mouth of December tables will be submitted exhibiting the population of each stato and county in the United States, distinguished as native or foreign, white or colortd, malo or femalo. The accounts of 28,410 enumer ators have already been settled, involving a total of expenditure of upwoidsol $1,820,000. Only about 1,200 account remain unudjusl ed, and there is "no reason to doubt that the month cf December will see all the enume rators paid for their services, except only in cases where a susjieusiou is required for reasons uumislakabiy connected with some fault, more or less serious, on tho part of tho enumerator himself. It has been suggested informally by some of tho Democratic members of tlio next House, who are in town, that their party ran retain its control of tho House of Rep resentatives by forming a coalition with the greenbaekers, and it is said that movements have already been instituted with that end in view. It is not believed, however, that any influential portion of the democratic membership of the next House would favor such a proposition, and even If democratic consent was obtained it is extremely doubt ful whether a sufficient number of green backers to control the House could be in duced to enter the alliance, as probably one' half of them are out olid out Republicans. With reference to tho appoiuluient of a c'uief signal officer (aud there now seems to bo some doubt as to the coining man, it will not in the least intertere with the pro jeeta of scientists, who are determined to carry the matter to Congress. It is quite generally understood now that these gentle men failed to secure the co-operation of the President io tlio matter of transferring to scientific control the meteorological branch ot the service) and it is their present inten lion tohaveabill introduced early in the ses sion which will secure to them the mnch raveled prize. The bill will meet with much opposition. The National Grangehas declared in favor of elevatiug the head "I tne Agricultural Tnnrtment to tho ilieuity of a Cabinet Of fleer, and tbo members ol Congress who live in agricultural iiitru-is may ua urjirnuru upon to argue the matter at the oomiug ses sion. There U a bill tending for this pur pose in the Route, but there will not be time, erbapr, t jawli it to a ooti elusion this winter, but the ajiriaullural internls will umibtUM urge IbequwHwu m the next Con gress.

For the coit Congress the returns from the bock districts are now all In, and it can be definitely stated that the House will stand 1S3 llcpublicans and 140 Democrats a clear Republican majority ofl3. "This estimate accounts for every member and places the few elected as Independents and Green backers where It Is understood they will re spectively vote on political questions. One striking feature of the new list that attract ed my notice in looking it over is the many changes In tho personnel of the next Houe. Oue hundred and four members who re spond to their names in this Congress have been retired by tho whirligig of time and tho fortunesot war, lo private life. In avery few cases tho absent names will appear in other branches of the public service. Among the ipnst prominent members of the present Congress who wilt not figure In the nut aro Senators Thurman, Eaton, McDonald, Shar oil, Randolph, Wallace, Kcrnnn, Withers r,d Bruce; und Representatives Banford, Lewis und Lowe, of Alabama; Davis, of California! Hawlcj, of Connecticut) Felton, f Georgia; Hayes and Fort, of Illinois; Ulckiicll, New, Hosteller, Baker and Do La Matyr, of Indiana) Price, Weaver and Gil lette, ol Iowa) Thomas Turner, of Kentucky) Kimn.cl and Henkle, of Maryland) Lorlng nd Claffin, of Massachusetts; Singleton, of Mississippi) Wells and Phillips, of Missouri; Claik, of Now Jersey; Covert, Chittenden, Btarlu and Lounsbury, of New York) Davis and Steel, of North Carolina; McMahon, Hurd, Ewlng, Warner, Monroe and Gar field, of Ohio; Clymer, Wright, Klllenger, CoH'roth and Whlte,of Pennsylvania; Bright, of Tennessee; Goode, Johnston, Harris and Hunton, of Virginia; and Bouck, of Wiscon- Sumo of theso gentlemen declined a renoinlnatlon, others were defeated In con vention, while oihcrsyet got leftot tho polls. Whether tho changes nro to be for better or worsa a little lime will tell. The places of some of these men will be hard to fill,but they eay that in such a budy of great and good men as the United State j Congress a few stars more or less can scarcely bo missed. The thought is encouraging. A writing table made from timbers of the ship Resolute was recently received at the White House and has been noticed by many visitors. It is of oak and is u magnificently carved piece of furniture. Upon one of the smooth panels is tho following inscription: II. M. S. Rcsoluto, forming part of the ex pedition sent in search of Sir John Frank lin, in 1852, was abandoned in latitude, 74 degrees 41 minutes, longitude 101 degrees 22 minutes west, on the 15th of May, 1854. She was discovered and extricated in Sep tember, 1855, In latitude 07 degrees north, by Captain Buddington, of tho U. S. whaler Georgo Henry. Tho ship was purchased, fitted out and sent to England as a gift to her majesty Queen Victoria by tho Presi dent and people of the United States as a token of good will and friendship. This table was made from her timbers when she was' broken up and is presented by the Queen of Great Britain nnd Ireland to .the President of tho United States as a memor ial of the courtesy and loving kindness which dictated the offer of the gift of the Resolute." Mr. A. Watson, the inventor and intro ducer cf the stamped newspaper wrappers, as well as tlio originator of ninny other valu able ideas In the economy and convenience of national buslncss,suggests very pertinent ly that the permanent dissemiualion of popu lation statistics Is of wry great Importance. To materially aid in this It is suggtacd that all newspapers keep the population of the city or town where published standing per manently on the first page or on the editor ial page, as: Washington, D. C, Population, 180,000. If this was universally adopted, then wherever a newspaper Is seen the popu lation of tho city or town where published would be known. This would bo a benefit to the public generally, and also to all news papers in their exchanges, and would abso lutely cost nothing. For tho same purpose it is also suggested that all post-offices keep tho population of tho city or town perman ently set In the bottom of tho place and date stain), where there is plenty of room as: Washington, D. C, Population, 180,000; or the figuies alone, in round numbers, as their meaning would soon be understood. Then whet! a letter or postal card was received Horn uny city or town its size would be known, which would be generally useful to the public, nnd, like the other, would cost nothing. The census of all cities and towns is now known and tho newspapers might start the ball. Don Pkouo. NEW 

YORK. FBOU OUR CKQCLAB CORBESrONDXT. Nxw York, Dec. 7th, 1880. Just now the papers are giving space and prominence to John Kelly, Democratic and Republican journals uniting in a very free expression of opinion, cither pro or con, as to tho course of the great Tammany chief tain during tho late campaign. Whatever one may think of Mr. Kelly, either from a political or religious standpoint, he certain ly stands out as a representative figure of u very characteristic outgrowth of one side of our perculiar national institutions. Born in Ireland, he came to America when a child, and from the very lowest rank of life has worked his way by rapid strides to the po- itlon of ucfacta autocrat of the metropolis ftho continent. Although having begun life as a day laborer, he is neither illiterate nor uneducated. Indeed, few public men n this city ore better versed in history, classics and literature than he is,while he is said lobe an accomplished French scholar. In his social relations lie is particularly fort unate, being the nephew of Cardinal Mc- Closkey. A reporter who went to interview him the other day gave a verv correct im pression of the man when ho said t "If I had met him in the dark and simply con versed with him, I should have thought I was talking to one of the most refilled and polished gentlemen in the world j to see him in the light, and not to hear him speak, I should say ho was one of Ihe most pro pounced Irishman in face and feature I ever saw John Kelly has had somo very funny ex periences in his day, and no small share of theso have been connected, with his two newspapers, both daily. To owu,orcontrol, an organ is the hejght of the ambition of many tioliticians. While to have two apers subject to his beck and call has its advant ages, it also involves a double share of at tention and annoyance. In connection with Mr. Kelly ami hu papers I will relate an Incident which came under my own obser vation a couple of years or more ago. Late one night, after the morning papers had gone to press,a rumor got down to Park Row to the effect that Mr. Kelly, then as now Comptroller, had defaulted in a very large sum and fled the oity. This canard reached the long ears of two Star reporters, who, with the oalin consciousness of duty done,! roerous and immense advantages that would were Indulging in liquid refreshments at a contiguous saloon. Here was an opportun ity for a display ofenteiprise,that could not be allowed to pats unimproved. So these two young gentlemen went up town to Mr. Kelly's Fifth Avenue residence about five u'elocit in the morning, and after a good deal of trouble and some delay found tbem- selves In the p'eseucaof theenileiun,who was In trousers, role de nuil and a (lata of general dishabille and consternation. Surely nothing short of the burping 'ot the Star building could account for such a visit at such an unearthly hour. Well what was the matter! What did they want. Aghast at finding themselves face to face, with .the man they did not expect to see, there was a moment's hesitation. At last the leader mustered up courage toBtammeri "So you havn't fled the city ?" "Flcdl Fled from what for what?" "Why, the fact Is Mr. Kelly ,thero was a story down town to-night that you had become a defaulter and had fled to escape arrest. We thought If it was Iruo the Star onght to know it first." Mr. Kelly couldn't find words for a moment. Finally ho oekcdi "Who sent you 7 was it Mr. Sandison or thn city editor ordered you to ask these questions t" " Oh, no one sent tl). Wo just thought we'd look It up our selves. One part of the rumor has proved to be false. But is It true that your accounts are crooked 7" For one instant there was denso silence. It was broken by the sud den slamming of the door In the faces ot the enterprising Star reporters' at tho critical moment when Mr. Kelly's reply was talcing a form of expression not familiar to the theological seminaries. The reporters re turned down town with an uncomiortable consciousness that they had somehow or other made colossal not 'to say calamitous asses of themselves by calling the proprie tor of tho paper on which they themselves were working out of his bed before daylight to ask him If be was a thief 1 Their worst fears were realized when Mr. Kelly put in an appearance at the Star office early next day, demanding In a manner that he made no eflbrt to conceal his annoyance : "Who were those d d fools who called me up at five o'clock this morning to Interview mens to whether I had been stealing from tho city treasury 7" The names of tho culprits were unearthed and given to bin. "Firo them I" was his only order in connection with tho matter. And they were "fired" This is the first time this Btory has ever found itself hi a newspaper. A nhase of our modern brand of civil!- zatlon-or lack of It-which holds public attention bv its rcallstlo horror, one, which can never be Ignored.is tho calendar of capi- tal crimes. In this city alone, at tho begin- nlng of tlio term of court now in session.there were confined fifteen persons awaiting trial for murder. Of theso tho Imncman will havo his cent per cent ol blood for blood, while a majority of tho number will enter upon longer or shorter terms of imprison ment. Speaking of crime I am reminded of tho fact that verv few of our Chlness residents of New York aro ever arrested, and when they ore, nine times out of ten it is on the charge of assault.which proves to have been theso adopted children from the Flowery Kingdom havo becomo naturalized citizens and voted at tho recent election. While the census for 1880 only gives a population of between 700 and 800 to this city, I am told bv intolliirent Chinamen of mv arauaint- anco that there are nearly 3,000 of those ex- orientals here, of which number fully ono third have come the present year. lain in clined to give the larger credence to the fig ures given me by Ah Fie, than to the neces sarily inaccurate United States census re port.

But this Issue, the opening of which depends on Prince Bismarck, wilt not bo opened, and he will have no excuso for not doing so ; for the Issue has been candid ly iolnted out to him." It will bo remem bered that, In tho jierfoce to the "Supplied uno Fcmnie," M. Emilo do Glrardln, the nestor of French journalists, boasted that a new and original Idea came to him every day. Of all the ideas with which ho tia filled a goodly number of volumes, not tho least original Is that of suggesting to Ger many that sho shall voluntarily cede a por tion of ber territory in order lo avoid u war. A diverting story ,llumorously.lllustrallve of Prince Jerome Bonoparle'a proverbial thlftlness, has recently gone tho round of tho Parisian newspapers. It appears that during the latter part of his cousin's relgn the Prince became dissatisfied with his boot maker, and formally withdrew his custom from that artist, who continued, neverthe less, to ornament the front of his shop with the attractive inscription, " Purveyor to bis Imperial Highness the Prince Napoleon." Noticing this delusive announcement one day, as he drove past tho shop, Princo Jerome sent a member or his household to tho boot maker with positive orders that tho inscription should be forthwith removed, As, however, he subsequently found that his commands had been disregarded, ho took legal proceedings against the boot maker for unlawful nnd mondacious advertisements of bis (the Princo'a) patronage. Tho defen danl's counsel, In the course of bis plead' ings, endeavored In the following ingcnlus manner to show causa why his client should not bo compelled to withdraw the offending Inscription, arguing that such a decision on tho part of the Court would Infallibly result In serious prejudice and loss to the boot ktr. "For," he observed, "hitherto poMors - by whoso attention wos attracted by & announcement in question stopped, en tered t'10 6boP an.bought boots freely of niy Client. Ana wny urn uiey so , because they llad fllrclJy 6aid to "'cmselvcs ' Prince Napoleon's boot maker I That must.be a good workman, and an uncommouly cheap ono into the bargain. We will give him a trial.' If you force him to remove his In scription, the peripatetic public will cer tainly infer that he must have raised his prices, and will hurry past his shop with averted eyes."

A method which has so approved lttelf by experimental tests at points whero such tests may do miny cuneiucruu tjuuciuoivv, uuuu be extended toall subordinate poittlons under the Government. 1 believe that a strong atid growing publln sentiment demands Immedi ate measures for securing and eniorclng the highest possible efficiency In tho civil service, and lis protection Irom recognised nbuses.and that the experience referred to has demon stratcd the feasibility of such moasures. The examinations In tne custom-houses and post offices have been held under many em. barrossinenlsana without provision lorcoin. pensailon for tho extra labor performed liy tho officers who have conducted them, and whose commendable Interest In the Improve mentofthe public service hns Induced this dtvotlon of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these lubors gra tuitously ought not to bo expected, and with out an appropriation by Congress for compen- Simon, ii is nui pracucuuie iu baichu iho ojb. tem of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It Is also highly Important that all such examinations should be conduct ed unon n uniform system ana unaer general mtRrviftfnn. Section 1753 of the Hevlscd Statutes authorizes the President to prescribe tho regulations for admission to th civil ser vice ol the United States,nnd forthls purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct tho re quisite Inquiries with reference to 'the fltness of each candidate.

It romes to ha understood hv ntmllcants for offico, and by tho people generally, that Re presentatives and .senators aro entitled to disburse tho patronage of their rcficctlvc dis trict? and States. It Is not necessary to re cite nt lenuth the evils resulting from this In vasion of ilie Executive functions. The true nrlnclules of Uovernment on tho subiect o ntmolutmenls to office, us stated In tho Na tional Conventions of the leading parties of the country, nave again aud again been ap proved by tho American people, and havo not oeen caueu in question in uny qunrier These authentic expressions of public opinion upon tins nii-impurinuiunjeri ore me state ment of principles that belong to the cunsti tutlonal structure of tho Government. "Under thoConsttrutlon, iho President and Heads of Departments aro to make nomina tions for office. The .senate Is to advise und consent to appointments, and tho House o Representatives Is to accuse and prosecuto faithless officers. Tho best Interest of the Eubllo service demands that theso distinctions e respeeUd; that Senators and Representa tives, who may bejudges and accusers, should notdlct&ta annolntmuiits to office' To this end the co-operation of the Legislative De partment oi ine uovernmeni is requireu anno uy ina necessuiua ui ine caco mm u, nub tin onlnlon.

Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities In Utah to enforce the laws against It. Kipirlenco has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be etlectlve, requires extensive mixwufaiion anu amend ment. Tho longer action 16 delayed, the more difficult It will be to accomplish what Is de sired Promptanddeclded measures areneces. sary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds poly a my has the whole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory, liy Us control of tho grand and petit juries, It l-ossetee large Influence over the administration of justice. Exercis ing, as the heads of this sect do, the local ini mical power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their Inutility to the law of Congress ou tno subject of polygninv, and, In fact, do prevent Its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished If the enloroemept of the law depends on those who pine lice and up hold the crime.
