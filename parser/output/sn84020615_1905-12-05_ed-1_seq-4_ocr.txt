McCREIGHT nuslness Manager MARKET MAKING Maxwell's Talisman, which has somewhat lost caste by Us opposition to the president's plan for congressional regulation of railway freight rates, must stilt ho Riven the palm for 11a dauntless. Indefatigable, and nhle activ ity In the matter of Irrigation for file arid regions. In Us latest Issue that paper says: In a reeent address Secretary Wilson staled that the settlement of the Mississippi valley created a home mar ket which was worth more to the manufacturers of the United States than the markets of till the rest of the world. It waa their own market and thpy did not have to compete for Its trade with other manufacturing nations. If the Mississippi valley with Its thirty or forty million of Inhabitants largely occupying farms of 1 (. 200,and BOO acres affords the best market in the world, what would be the reclaimed arid west where irrigation doubles and trebles the yield and farmers make fortunes out of twenty and forty-acre tracts? Desert land, when it Is provided with an adequate water supply, jumps In value from a dollar to a hundred dollars an acre and the created value of the American desert when irrigated with the flood wa ters which now run to waste, would he not far from ten thousand minion dollars, a valuation too stupendous for Intelligent conception. The most remarkable and wonderful feature of the Irrigation development of the government lies In the fact that the cost of this great work will all be repaid to the government. The first completed national irrigation work was announced last June a small patch of 50,000 acres and it Is significant that long before the. water from the big government ditch waa turned upon the land, every acre under It had been eagerly taken up by settlers, In 80-acre tracts, under agreements to repay the govern ment every dollar expended in the work.

MESSAGE The presidents message appears In this Issue of The Citizen absolutely unabridged and set In our own office. It Is said to contain some 30,000 words, anfl The Citizen takes this occasion to say that every word Vif it deserves the careful consideration of every intelligent, country loving American. With the exception of the civil war, there have never faced thig republic graver questions of a national character than those which now demand atention of our lawmakers; and upon the manner in which they meet and discharge their obligations, will depend the destiny of our country and its growing mil lions for many ages. President Roosevelt, In his mes sage, calls the attention of congress to these questions; and he does so with a wisdom and moderation born of careful study, large view, able grasp and unprejudiced conclusion. The American people may well ponder his words. ock.vcockoo 8 Oneness of Arizona! Andl New Mexico O From St. Johns, Arizona, Herald.

The remains of prehistoric man In both territories, as far as discovered, go to show that the people of those days, now denominated "Cliff Dwellers." "Plains Dwellers," "Aztecs." etc.. were In habits, customs, arts and pursuits, Identically the same. dive the points of similarity of these two territories, historical. The Spaish explorers visited the two; they found the same conditions existing In the two, the same climate as today; the same almost in everything. The Spanish founded settlements ami the people now called Mexicans grew up in both territories alike. These con quered in large degree the savage tribes nnd blazed tho way for the present civilization, in both. ine 1wo ter ritories were alike embraced in the colonies of Mexico, and remained such until acquired by the United States either by conquest or purchase. They remained as one territory until divided by the United States government in 1863. Both are still under the control of the United Slates government In a sense, the property of the gov ernment. Give the points of similarity of 1he two territories, industrially. Two great transcontinental lines of rail way puss through each; with a third building through both. Irrigation Is employed In farming enterprises of each. The products of the soli nre very much the same, embracing thrtse of the temperate and sub-tropical zones. Sheep and cattle raising are profitable industries, and have been for jears the principal source of commercial wealth, in both. Iloth have been the scenes Of opera tions at the hands of the prospector, until now when the ninlng industry is assuming large proportions, the pre cious metals In Ar'zona and the industrial minerals of New Mexico are reciprocally profitable to each other, business men being Interested in both territories. The man In overalls Is the producer of wealth In each. The non-resident or alien capitalist Is draining each of lis wealth, under present arrangements, while but a few capitalists are trying to develop and improve the ter- Itories. What are the points of similarity In the matter or population? Perhaps about nil nationalities are repre sented In both, with many from the different states of ne union residents. Each territory Is a factorv for making American Patriots. The people of eacn are patient, hospitable, and long su.Tering. and have uowers of endurance second to none. They are enterm islne and Independent. The conditions I 

ANOTHER FAKE ROAD STORY Governor Broward, of Florida: I am thoroughly In sympathy with the great national sentiment in favor of curbing bribers and bribe takers. I have already called the attention of the law makers of the state to this crim inal and un-American practice and expect to do ho again in my message to the next legislature. In my 'opinion, these grafters can be best detected and punished by a strong law, making the practice a felony, and exempting from punishment, and therefore compelling to testify, the person who accepts or is offered the bribe, In order that the greater criminal, the man who has placed the temp tation In the way of his fellow man, may be certainly reached and punished. I am Btrongly In favor of state insurance control and recommended such a plan to the last Florida legislature, and will urgently recommend It In my next message to the legislature. Washington Post.

It Is given particularly as an appreciation by Heveral thousand men, women, and children, who contributed to it because of the president's intervention that resulted In the ending of the war In the fur east. Governor Cutter, of Utah: I am In favor of the strictest laws consistent with true' freedom for the con trol of life insurance. I think the grafters will be puu Ished under the criminal law now on the statute books. The matter-is before the great state of New York, and 1 think jwe can trust to the officials of that state to do their duty. It may be well lor the government to take the matter of insurance under hs supervision. have no opinion to offer on thai question Just now. I may be counted on to assist In every reasonable way in cheek ing any tendency toward fraud,' bribery or corruption in the in.sur:nci juslness or In any other line. But 1 think calm r.n.t cool judgment should prevail, and the facts become fully known before drastic action Is taken or recommend d. N. O. Murphy, of Arizona, is reported as saying tue other day in Washington, D. C: As long as that obnox ious proposition (jointure with New Mexico) is before congress, I shall be in this vicinity, seeking to oppose it by every legitimate means. The people of Arizona 'are against it overwhelmingly, and if a fair expression oi the sentiment of New Mexico could 1 taken, a majority or its people would be found in the negative. Arizona is rich and prosperous, and there is no other cloud on its' horizon save this threat of being forced Into a most distasteful partnership. if wo cannot be admitted as a state on our own Individual merits, all we ask is to be allowed to remain as we now are. New Mexican: The office of I nited States marshal for New Mexico Ib one or the most desirable places within the gift of the president, and at this Urne, us far as known here, there Is no telling who the lucky man will be. At one time the office of United States marshal was of great political power in this territory. This happily has changed for the bejter, and outside of pro vlding one man and a few of his friends with Mood places the position Is not of much consequence to the ieol at large. It looks as if the present Incumbent, c, M Koraker, will succeed hlmsolf. The Sensational Yarn in the Morning Journal is De nounced as Pure "Rot." 

HOPEWELL WIRES FOR NEWS Pittsburg, f ference held of the company .. Dec. 4. At a con between the officers Pennsylvinln Development and Receiver Rinaker. and former Receiver Cunningham, representing the wrecked Enterprise National bank of Allegheny, an agree ment was reached as to the money due to the bank from the Development company.

It shows the career of the dread disease from the dark unventilated room In which it is born to the final catastrophe. It shows the means by which It can be Combated, and, better still, the means by which It can'be prevented. Fresh air and sunlight are the cure. The exhibition contains lessons in the rela tion of food to the cause and cure. Cases far advanced ure being nourished, aired and lighted back to health. Every enterprise that has for Its object the extension of knowledge concerning consumption and its cure is to lie welcomed. That scientific men should possess defi nite knowledge is not enough. No great progress can be made until the general public understand the simple rules of right living, which alone can baffle the disease. In the United States the death rate from tuberculosis Is frightfully high, as compared with that of other coun tries, and Is said to be increasing. Iji Europe the con quest lias been steadily advancing. In Prussia statistics show that at the present rate of decrease deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis will entirely cease in 20 years.
