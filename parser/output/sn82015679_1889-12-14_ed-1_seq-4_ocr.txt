The Sentinel and the Bailey-Coy gang cannot become reconciled to the result of last year's election. It was, indeed, a great and honest Republican victory. Benjamin Hakbisox's literary style is as clear as crystal and sharp as a razor. That of Grover Cleveland suggests an attempt to carve parboiled mush with the blunt edge of a meat ax. Gkovei: Cleveland solemnly orating about political corruption in Massachu setts, and the Indianapolis Sentinel howling about alleged Republican frauds in Indiana would make a good subject for a full-page cartoon in a pictorial pa per. . . ' After Mr. Cleveland had urged Bos ton merchants to give free suffrage, to tho wage-earner, Mr. Grady notified tho same (Mstinguishcd gentlemen that the intelligence of the South would overawe the poor colored voter. These do not seem to bo two of a kind; but, then( they are all the same. . It probably begins to glimmer in tho minds of tho patriots who were chasing Colonel Dudley about town tho other night that they made themselves laughing-stocks; but then, they can console themselves with tho fact that there is no statute law "agin" their making such exhibitions of themselves. In Massachusetts work in gm en are forming protection clubs, and they have issued an appeal to workingmen in other States to do tho same thing. "Free trade," says this address, "means more goods from abroad and less work here." All the imported professors in Harvard have not stated so much practical truth on the tariff question in ten years. , It is alleged that Mr. Calvin S. Brice has been escaping the payment c.f taxes upon a largo amount of personal prop erty on the assumption that he was not a resident of Ohio. Now that ho claims to he, and has taken up his residence in Lima, tho impudent tax-collector is after him with tax bills for several years. The tax-collector has the best of it just now. Chairman McKinlet, of tho- ways Tind means committee, has designated the sub-committees and outlined some im portant work. There will bo three bills reported as soon as they can be agreed upon; one reducing internal revenue, om revising the administrative portions of tho tariff bill, and a third revising tho tarifl'. If tho obstructionists do not pre vent, all these bills will bo pressed to early passage.- The St. Louis Post-Dispatch says there is no better proof that the war is over and its results accepted in tho South than tho fact that no confederate Hag was seen at the Davis funeral, and only tho Union banner was displayed. According to several trustworthy ac counts a rebel Hag was draped over the coffin . or! the leader of tho lost cause, thus taking tho point from the Dis patch's "fact." Reversing the St. Louis logic, and adjusting it to the truth, it follows that the war is not over, and the results not accepted by the South. The Philadelphia Record breaks out as follows: . Tan-Americana, go away; Come again some other day; . m - The G. O. P. won't always stay. This is an unexpected give-away. Ev erybody knows that tho opposition of the Democratic press to the inter-American congress is the fact that it is of Re publican origin, apd that it is being conducted under a Republicanadminis tnition. Fortunately for the country, tho G. 0. P. Tvill stay long enough to , secure to tho several nations concerned tho full benefits of tho conference. The New York Herald says that if all tho Southern States will pass Australian ballot laws tho Republican politicians who desire to take chargo of the, elec tion of members of Congress will bo disarmed and disappointed. Tho Her ald is mistaken; Republicans desire honest elections in the South. But as the most of the fraud is perpetrated after the ballots are cast, the Australian nystem would only be a mask behinc which fraud could bo more easily prac ticed. It can bo dgne, no matter how the voting is conducted, so long as all election officers are selected from one party, as is the custom in most Southern States. A correspondent, whoso letter is printed; in another column voices the true idea and what should bo the gen eral sentiment regarding tho street railway franchise. The city should not yield an iota of its just rights, and should make, the best bargain possible, under tho circumstances, but it should not go c.toil tho business ia a. grasping extor- tionate, unreasonable spirit. Tho bene fits are not all on one side, and while tho city owns a valuable franchise, it also needs rapid transit and improved street car facilities. If the present offer of tho company is not to bo accepted, and tho Journal thinks it should not be, the city should mako a counter-proposition, and continue tho negotiation in a fair and liberal spirit until au understanding is reached." But it should not go at the company with a club. THE 

ELECTION OF BEPRE3ESTATIVE3. Quite a number of Republican papers have questioned the expediency of tho enactment of a general law which shall take the election of Representatives to Congress out of tho hands of the State authorities in toto, and transfer the su pervision thereof to a board, to bo ap pointed by the President. The objec tions are based upon several grounds, but chiefly that such elections should not be practically placed in the hands of the executive, and that it would entail a very pTeat Him UDDecessarjr cipeueui But the bill which Senator Chandler of New Hampshire has offered in the Sen ate, and which is understood to embrace the main features of a measure favored by General Chalmers of Mississippi, does not seem to bo open to such objections. Anabstractof the Chandler bill has been printed in the Journal. Its main feat ures are that federal supervision shall bo confined to districts where a 6tated number of voters petition tho United States Court for such supervision, on the ground that the election under State authorities will not be honestly man aged; that all of the election ollicers shall be equally divided between tho two parties; that a registration shall bo made, the votes counted and returned, and cer tificates given- to the candidate who is elecfed, which shall bo his credential. It seems that such a system would insure a fair election, and that none, except those who are unwilling to' trust tho result to a free vote and a fair count, can object to such a law. During tho last twelve years tho political complexion of at least two Houses of Representatives has been given them becaiiso of the sup pression of suffrage and of frauds by the falsification or throwing out of re turns. This state of things cannot be allowed to continue if the people of this country are to navf popular govern ment. Something must be done, and the Chan'dler bill, seems to afford a remedy which will bo applied only where the frauds in tho past warrant the transfer of tho conduct of such elections to United States ofiicials who will represent both parties. . , 

ORATOR JEKTLL,' EDITOR HYDE. In person there is but one Grady the editor of the Atlanta Constitution but he presents two characters, before tho public, one in his newspaper and the other at Northern banquets, after the feast is over and the champagne makes tho orator eloquent and the hearer tear ful. In yesterday's issue an extract of an editdrial'of the Constitution was quoted, in which Mr. Grady declares, in effect, that the colored man will receive suf frage and his rights before the law when he learns to vote the Democratic ticket, and not until then. Thursday night tho same Mr. Grady addressed a Boston au dience after Mr. Cleveland, when ho made bold to speak as follows: It would le well if Northern partisans would understand that the negro vote can never again control the South. If there be ftiiy human force -which cannot be with stood it is that of the banded intelligence and responsibility of a free community. Upon that tho outh relies; not upon the cowardly menace of mask or shotguns, l'orco bills will not avail. The North may Mirrcmler its liberties to federal election law, but never aam will a single State, North or South, be delivered to thj control of an ignorant and inferior race. Mr. Grady ought to know that every man of average intelligence knows that this talk about the negro vote control ling the South is twaddle. In but thrco States do the negroes outnumber tho whites. In view of this fact, if the ne gro can control the eleven so-called' Southern States, iu all of which he is in x decided minority, then he must repre sent tho superior race. He must be "tho human force which Mr. Grady says "cannot bo withstood." Now, if tho Mr. Grady in Boston were as frank as tho Mr. Grady in the editorial rooms of tho Constitution, in Atlanta, ho would have said that tho negro would be welcomed as n voter when he will voto the whole Democratic ticket, but so long as ho votes for natives of the South who run as Republicans or Independents, for any ofiico whatever, he will not bo permitted to exercise even the form of suffrage. When Mr. Grady says that the shotgun and cowardl menace are not used to ueter the colored man irom exercising the rights of a freeman, ho forgets the Moody outrage a. Forest City, Ark., a few months ago; tho in timidatious and fraud attending the elec tion in a Louisiana congressional district recently; tho fact that tho Republican candidate for Governor in Mississippi was deterred from making a canvass, because Democrats warned leading Re publicans that his meetings would be made the pretext lor shooting negroes, and tho bitter fight made upon Mahone, who has done more for the material wel fare of Virginia than any Democratic politician, because he is "a traitor to the confederate cause," to quote a Virginia Democratic paper. Mr. Grail' follows the evasion and the threat in the above extract with the fol low ing gusli, which eoiitrats straugcly with the spirit and utterance of the At lanta paper, which has been filled with glorification of Davis and the lost cause every day since his death, and with expressions of bitterness and eon tempt for each men as General Miles, in which he asks tho North to give the South: First, patience: out of this alone can come perfect work. Second, confidence: in this alone can you judgo fairly. Third, sympathy: in this you can help us best. 'Fourth, give us your so'ns as hostages, that they. may help to swell the Anglo-Saxon current until it ran carry without danger thisbl.u k infusion.. Fifth, loyalty to tho R'p;iMit for thre is sectionalism in es trangement. (Jive us tho broad and perfect loyalty that loves and trusts (itorgiu alikf with Massachusetts that Knows no South. r4o North, no Kast. no West, but endears with equal and patriotic lovo Mvery foot of our soil, every State of our Union. "Give us your sous as hostages," he demands. He fchould have added, "if they will vote tho Democratic" ticket; but if they will not, and become candi dates for office in opposition, to that party, they will bp ostracised." But it were better not to add that untu tno "sons" have arrived in the South: The truth is, tho Democratic leaders in tho South will not tolerate political opposi tion or that freedom of political action which is tho mainstay of popular gov ernments. After a threat, Mr. Grady appeals for patience. Wo have had patience these twenty years, and all that has been worked out is tho overthrow of free suf frage. Patience is no longer a virtue, but a, public danger. Republicans do not desire to control any State of tho South and put it into the hands of ne groes, but there are twenty congres sional districts in the South which, with a free election and an honest count, would elect Republicans. By menace and ballot-box frauds, they are made to return Democrats. These districts thus carried by fraud have twice made the House of Representatives Democratic, to make war upon tho industrial inter ests of the North. Tho Republicans do not propose to permit this great wrong l fe- JIX It 111CJ 1IU 71 C IJH V end the Republican Congress will try to make a law which will take the super vision of elections in such congressional districts out of the hands of ballot-box stuffer8 and tho makers of bogus returns and ca.ivasscs, and put it in the hands of men who will sec that theso elections are fairly conducted. The Grady threat and the Grady gush will not deter them. A FREE-TRAD ESON SUBSIDIES. Hon. Hugh McCulloch, ex-Secretary of the Treasury, is on the wrong side of the tariff question, but on the right side of the subsidy question. Although an ad vocate of free trade ho favors govern-. ment aid in the development of our mer chant marine and tho establishment of foreign steamship lines. Iu a recent let ter to tho New York Evening Post, after referring to tho importance of tho ques tion, ho says: Permit tne to suggest that a definite an swer to the following questions would clear the way for a proper understanding of this subject: ' First Have any of the great maritime nations become ' what they are in this re spect by individual or corporate capital and enterprise alone,! In other words, have or have not the existing steamship lines of theso nations received government aid, either by subsidies or by liberal payments for services? , Second Dots the presentconditionof the shipping interest of the United States in dicate an absence of the enterprise that once made her second to only one as a mari time nation Third Is not tho restoration of our mer chant marine a matter of very great, if not of vital importance to the country, and the whole country! And is there good reason to expect thatcapitalists (even if thednties on the raw materials which are needed in ship-buihling should be removed), would build ships and run them in competition with the well-established and powerful foreign lines, without at least as much aid from onr wovernment as they have received from theirs? I agree with the Evening Post in its op position to tho present taritf, but as more than half a century ago I thought that in cidental protection was needed to induce capitalists to put their money into manu- factories, so now I think that aid from the irovernment is imDerativelv required to se cure the rebuilding of merchantmen for the foreign tvade; the aid to be rendered by direct subsidies or bv liberal compensation for carrying the mails. Mr. McCulloch is one of tho most prominent advocates of free trade, but in this letter ho recognizes the fact that other governments subsidize their steamship lines, and that this 'govern ment must do tho same if it would com pete with them; he adds, "the aid to bo rendered by direct subsidies or by lib eral compensation for carry ing the mail s' The latter is the British method. Great Britain does not pay tho enormous sum of $3,18-1,435 a year for carrying the for eign mails alone. Her mails are carried on nono but British steamships, and they are paid for the service a "fancy" price, which covers a subsidy. In a de- j,ate hi the House of Commons a few months ago a suggestion was made that money could bo saved by sending cer tain mails on a ibrcign line of steamers. To this Postmaster-general Raikes said: "I think that if the honorable member only took tho pains to study the course of public opinion be would find that a contract with the North German line or the French line would have a very slight chance of being adopted by the House of Commons." The British mail is carried on none but British vessels. In this debato it camo out that the Brit ish Peninsular and Oriental Company had elected to take 8475,000 a year less for a ten-years' contract than for a seven-years1 contract. To a question if this would result in cheaper post age, Postmaster-general Raikes replied: "Without wishing to commit the gov ernment iu the least, I may say that I should prefer not to chargo the Penin sular and Oriental for services which are postal in one sense, but which are under taken partly for political, commercial and other objects." That tells the story. Tho Peninsular and Oriental Company does not receive several hundred thou sand dollars a year for postal services aloue, but for services rendered "for po litical, commercial and other objects." We are glad fo know there is at least one free-trader in the United States who is not so blind to tho interests of his own country as to oppose a policy practiced by -all other civilized govern ments. Mr. McCul loch's head is level on the subsidy question. TiiKHKis asimilarity of tone and languago in tho letters which the Hon. Grover Cleve land is writing by the dozen in the interest of the further education of tho Democratic party. Oscitatious monoton' describes these epistles better than any other phrase that occurs to us at tho moment. New York Sun. The Sun is noted for linguistic lore, but wo hardly think the phrase "oscita tious monotony" occurred to it on the moment. It was more probably the re sult of careful research to tind a word queer enough and mysterious enough to describe Mr. Cleveland's proleptic wis dom and chronic tenebrosity. Tin: Sentinel affects great indigna tion because British ships at New Or leans half-masted their flags in honor of Jeff Davis, and demands that Mr. Blaine resent "this international insult." This is going a long way ta.find ground of censure against the administration. Tho rebel tlag was displayed more than once in this State during tho war. and many times since in the Souh.Svithout evoking censure from the Sentinel. It did not condemn the Cleveland admin istration, which put the United States Hag at halx-mast in honor of Jacob Thompson. It never censured any of tho treasonable acts or alliances of Jeff Davis. Why, then, this sudden out burst of patriotic indignation at tho British vessels! In the name of the prophet, "rats!" The British government is strength ening its fortillcations in Canada, but whether it 13 to defend Canada,orto keep its people from forsaking that conn try for tho United States, no one ap pears to know. ' Kentucky has furnished so many in stances of lawlessness that she cannot atlord to lose ! the credit of rather a remark able illustration of honesty just recorded. A few days ago a man of neat and unassuming appearance applied at the gate of tho penitentiary at Frank fort for admission to examine the premises. Ho paid the gate fee of 25 cents, which is devoted to the prison library, and with a guard walked from the cell-house to the work-shops, from work-shop to dining room and kitchen, and from kitchen to the hospital, and over to the female portion of the yard, commenting on and inquiring, as they passed from department to depart ment, about the rules and regulations, the various kinds of tasks and manner of treat ment in particular cases. When the exam ination was complete, the visitor thanked the guard and said that he would probably be back again - to call on them before night; that he wanted to take a look at the city of Frankfort, which he thought was quite picturesquely situated. Two hours after ward ' he returned and handed the gate keeper an order of commitment and a letter from tho sheriff of Bell county, which directed the warden of the penitentiary to hold in confinement in the peniten tiary for one year for the crime of malicious shooting and wounding. The conviction was had last 1 August, but for some reason' or other tbe sheriff couldn't bring the prisoner, in whom ho had the utmost con fidence, and he therefore allowed him to deliver himself up to the warden. The prison ofiicials could hardly credit the man's statements that he was the prisoner referred to in the order of the court; but, as he was anxious to be incarcerated and begin serving his term, he was allowed to doff citizen's clothes aud put on a convict garb without further questioning. His delivery of himself saved tho State $32, which would have been paid to the sheriff if he had brought him. If the practice of voluntary 6tirreuder should become gen eral among Kentucky criminals the State would have to build several new prisons. The now method of Crawford county White Caps to get rid of people personally obnoxious to them by organizing "mid night circles," and manufacturing false evi dence of crime against their victims,' sounds wonderfully like the tricks in vogue with another "circle" organization quite popular among certain classes of people in southern Indiana some twenty-five or thirty years ago. As "Knights of the Golden Circle," "Ku-klux Klan" auxiliaries, "White Caps" or "Midnight Circles," the same old idtol erant and barbaric spirit, bred in the bone, seems bound to crop out at intervals despite all the humanizing influences that modern civilization can bring to bear. 'The City Council of Portsmouth, Vo., disregarding all party differences, has passed resolutions of regret at the coming departure of Commodore George Brown from the naval station at that place, which he has so long commanded. The resolutions express high appreciation of tho Com modore as an officer and a gentleman, and compliment him for his efforts in behalf of the development and improvement of the station, and his economical expenditure of the funds committed' to his trust. This testimonial (will be gratifying to Commo dore Brown's3 Indianapolis friends as show ing another recognition of his abilities and high character. r PlllLADF.LrniA doesn't permit its broth erly love to interfere in the least with its cautious and sound business principles. The other day an honored bank president's carriage was found overturned on the river bank and everything indicated that the honored president had mot with a fatal ac cident. The directors of the bank held a called session at once, but instead of draw ing up memorial resolutions they proceeded at once with an examination of the hon ored president's accounts. "Business be fore grief" is sometimes as useful a motto .as "business before pleasure." Since Doin Pedro has refused to accept the pension of 450,000 per year tendered him by Brazil, the admiration felt for him throughout tho United States has been re doubled. As. bit by bit, the incidents of tho Brazilian revolution come tons, they develop a story out of which might be con structed one of the most unique, pathetic and powerful dramas in the literature of the world. Edgah Saltus's "Transaction in Hearts" has been followed by a transaction in conrtin which Mrs. Saltus takes the part of plaintiff. It is a natural sequel to the story. A man capable of the mental im morality that could pVoduce such a talo must inevitably have the weakness of char acter.that carries tho intellectual processes into practice; - Rev. Br, Storks, of Brooklyn, charges that Mr. Bok, the head of a newspaper syndicate, so changed his letter regarding tho use of tobacco by adding two lines as to commit the eloquent divine to the use of the weed. Dr. Storrs does not wish to t-3 put on record as being on that side. If all the animosities that Jefterson Davis helped to engender could have been buried in the same grave with his remains, his funeral would have marked. an hundred years' advance jn the civilization and prog ress of the section ho led to humiliation and disaster. 

ABOUT F0rLE AXD THINGS. . Jefferson Davis mustered Abraham Lincoln into the service of the United States in tho Black Hawk war in 1831. Balzac was only fifty years of age when ho died. He wrote twenty-seven works, and his death was hastened by night-work and strong coffee. Thkke is in Pottstowu, Pa., a family con sisting of live women whose tastes are so different that they long ago established a rule requiring each one to do her own cook ing. "She is tall, almost as tall as I am." said Mrs. Vice-president Morton of her eldest daughter, "and looks womanly, too; but she is only fifteen, and it seems too absurd to talk of her coming rut when she is really scarcely out of the nursery," The Knssians have determined to estab lish a six-class school of a higher grade in Jerusalem. A commission appointed by the educational department has gono to tho Holv City to inaugurate the new work, 'ihe'total costs will be borne by the govern ment. A numuei: of tho ablest men in tho pres ent Congress are, it is stated, in such ill health as to be incapacitated for tbe con tinuously active discharge of their onerous public duties.

It is confidently expected there that she will now make an early reply to the serious accusations that have been made against her in tho matter of "Little Lord Fauntleroy." The Volksraad. or Public Council of the Republic of Transvaal, South Africa, has determined to establish a university at Pretoria, the capital of the country. The official language being Dutch, the teachers are to be called from Holland, whither tho Cnltus Minister Datoit has gone for this purpose. Three young girls in Manchester, Eng land, who were unemployed two years ago, started a bureau for mending socks and stockings, sewing on buttons, repairing frayed shirts and other things which some people are too busy to attend to. To-day they employ fifty hands, and are realizing a handsome income from the business. Du Maurier, the artist, was educated originally in scientific chemistry, and as a very young man once took charge of a gold mine in Devon a gold mine in which, how ever, there was no gold, as he very soon found out. But the desire of art was so strong iu him that he gave up his profession and went to Paris, aud there he studied ffr a year at uleyre's studip. Baron Nathaniel de Rothschild had a narrow escape from being killed" about a fortnight ago. He was riding over a cranky wooden bridge on his estate at Schillers dorf, iu Silesia, when the planking gave way, and he and his horse rolled into a ditch thirty feet beneath the bridge. Al though he received many painful bruises, the Baron was not seriously injured, and is in no danger. Gladstone is not only a grand old man, but he is also ne of the most extraordinary men of the age. In his eightieth year he is not only the leader of a great political party, but the maker of a literary reputa tion by a word. His praiso gave "Robert. Elsmere" a send-off that made it the moat successful novel of a decade. How Mr. Gladstone finds time for all he does is quite as wonderful as that he . accomplishes so much, especially at his advanced age. A gentleman who has recently returned from Lisbon relates Che following 6trange coincidences in connection with the death of the late King of Portugal. It appears that v hen the cathedral bell at Braganza, the ancient residence of the Portuguese royal family, was tolling for the death of. Queen Marie II, mother of the late King Luiz I, in 1853. it cracked. In 1S61. when the castle ensign was hoisted half-mast high at Braganza, on the occasion of the death of King Pedro V, brother of 4he late King, it was torn to pieces immediately by the storm. a At the death of King Luiz I. last month the cathedral bell again cracked and the castle ensign was again torn to shreds by tho wind.

The United States pays nolhing for sub sidies and so little for carrying the mails that some of the lines have carried them free for years, refusing tho pay. The law compels American vessels to carry the mails on demand of tho Postmaster-general. The reason we have no ocean merch ant marine ought to be apparent. Cleve land Leader. The President Message. Andrew Carnegie, in New York Independent. The President's message is excellent as a whole. It is calm, dignified and statesman like; but I do not like its tampering with silver. The permanent prosperity of our country will be best insured? by a strict maintenance of the highest monetary standard, which is gold, until Europe agrees with us upon the silver question. Secretary Windom's proposition is not so very objectionable in itself, but it is dan gerous as making further advance easy in the wrong direction. England controls tho finances of the world, and would rejoice to seo us undertake to solve the silver prob lem, while she sits safely resting upon a gold standard. There is no hope for Amer ica ever wresting from Englaud the linan cial supremacy, if we should be rash enough to forsake the gold standard. Secretary Tracy's proposal to increase tho navy 1 read with pain. It would be far less injurious and less dangerous to create a large standing army than a formidable navy intended to cope with the huge arma ments of European powers. Give us war ships and we shall have wars. The cost of maintaining these useless instruments of destruction will be enormous. Secretary Tracy's suggestion that we build fast ships for peaceful commerce, which could be made cruisers if ever required for such pur pose, is admirable, and should be adopted: but no additional war-ships proper should be built, for the navy, last merchant cruisers will develop our commerce during peace, and will be more useful should war ever come, which is hardly possible. These are the spots upon the sun. The message shines brightly, notwithstanding these, and is worthy of .the President, of tho party and of the Nation. Dom Fedro Owed Fifty Cents. New York Letter In Philadelphia Times. He (Colonel Cbaille Long) told me a short but interesting story apropos of Doni Pe dro's enforced retirement from tbe imperial throne of Brazil. "Dom Pedro," he said, "is a thorongh democrat, and I have many reasons for believing that if he did not actively connive at his own retirement, ho was at least aware that it was about to be forced upon him and took no steps to pre vent it. He was so much of a democrat, in fact, that I can boast of the fact that, even when be was Emperor of Brazil, he owed me fifty cents. The manner in which this enormous debt was incurred is amusing: When the Brazilian Emperorvisited Egypt, the Khedive, in whose service I was then engaged, appointed me Dom Pedro's chief of staff. It was part of my duty to see that the royal chariot, drawn by four magnifi cent horses, should be every morning at tbe door-way of tho Emperors hotel. Dom Pedro had a deep-rooted dislike to this dis play, and evaded the chariot whenever pos sible. One morning I arrived in front of his apartments in time to see the Emperor i'ump into the most disreputable looking lack in. Alexandria. I followed him on horseback to his destination, but he was so desiroos of being able to roam about without the companionship of royal ofii cials that he sprang from the queer-looking conveyance and hastened awaj without paying tho driver his fare. The Jehu, un aware of the Emperor's identity, was, jrith loud cries, runniug after him, when I inter cepted him and paid the M cents which was owing. The incident is inteiesting simply as showing what a profound contempt Dora, Pedro has for ceremonial forms." DUapprores of the Alliance. FhUSilelphia Record. . . We have a profound distrust of the med dling of 6ecret societies in politics. For this reason we look for no public advant age as a resultaut from the coalition of the Knights of Labor, and the farmers secret organizations. Some of the measures which they advocate like the free coinage of silver and government ownership of railroads are dangerous or dishonest. To cheapen the legal tender of the country wonld be mere stealing from tbe pockets of one portion of the people to fill the pockets of another portion. To put the railroads in the hands of the federal government would be to turn the government over in per petuity to whatever party should have pos session of the railroads and the government at the same time. That party could not be dislodged. A fusion brought about with such ends in view. is a fusion of scatter brains. Neither the great body of labor ing men nor tho farmers could be led or driven into the support of such folly. Insulting Washington's Blemory. Charleston News ami Courier. Davis led the revolution of thirteen sov ereign States against the usurpations of a government which derived Its only powers lrom the consent of the States. Could Washington and Davis have exchanged places and times, the people of the South would hold memorial meetings, to-day, in honor of Washington, and tho national Capitol at Washington would ring with the praises of Davis. Kepresenting the same principles, striving for the right of the people, conscious of their own rectitude and devoted to the supremacy of the Con stitution and the laws, Washington and Davis are equally and alike entitled to the reverence of the American people. . Jeff Davis Looked Like a Postage Stamp. Baltimore American. . One day a drunken confederate cavalry man who had never seen Mr. Davis, but was perfectly familiar with the postage stamps, saw his chief in the streets of Itich moud. Going up to him, he asked in a silly, drunken manner: "Are yon Mr. Davis?" 1 "1 am, sir was the dignified reply. "President of the Southern Confederacy f "I have that honor, sir." "I thought so, you look 60 much like a postage stamp." Criticisms of Extremists. Minneapolis Tribune: Thero is an extreme gold party, strictly monometallism in this country, and there is an extreme silver party, monometallist also in fact, whether so in theory or not. These two elements are trying to criticise Mr. Windom's plan. Their criticisms are not sound, and their positions respectively are narrow and selfish. Th?ir assaults are mutual! destructive; and the great body of the people, taking a sensiblo view, will com to the support of a policy that prom ises stability and health in the circulating medium. It Depends on Congress. Central Christian Advocate. If Congress is at all disposed to consult the public welfare by giving it the preference over party management, it has rarely had a better field for the oxercise of its faculties; for tho President and his Cabinet favor action on the tariff, the silver question, the Chinese, trusts, revision of the naturaliza tion laws, postal affairs, the navy, Indian afl'airs, the pension laws, civil-servico law. national aid to edacation, tho civil rights of the negroes and subsidies to steamship..

Central Christian Advocate. N Mr. Robert Ingersoll has mado a defense of agnosticism in one of our monthly maga zines. It overflows with self-confidence and dictatorial assertion of greater knowl edge than any other person in the world possesses. Taking hisstatement as the basis of a definition, we would describo an agnostic as one who mado his ignorance of religious matters the standard of other people's knowledge.

NATURAL GAS AT K0K0.M0 Residents Were Slow in Getting to Work, but Quickly Made Up the Lost Time, And They Now Proudly Feint to A Lare In crease in Population and a Xarator of H n;e Factories Facts About Gas Leases. St&ff Correspondence of the Indianapolis Journal. KOKOMO, Dec li Kokomo was slower in getting started in thenatnral-gas race than any of the larger towns in the Indiana belt. The first gas well was Struck here on the Cth of October, 1SS6, but the year 1S7 was pretty well advanced before the community apparently realized the full 6cope of its op portunity and began to take advantage of it vigorously. The old regime was a littla slow in its methods, and. if the truth be fully told, a little old-fashioned in its ideas. A. B. Armstrong, the treasurer of the W. G. Fischer Manufacturing Company, who was born and reared here, called my attention, to-day, to a fonny illustration of tho queer notions thtt governed the actions of the forefathers. Vhcn the Indianapolis & Peru railroad, afterward the Indianapolis. Peru fc Chicago, and now the Lake Krie& Western, was built, thero was quite a strife between tho rroperty-holders on the two principal streets of the town as to which of the two thoroughfares should have tho hon or of supporting the rails of the newrailroad. What tbe desire was founded on, unless it was an opportunity to sit at their windows andseothe wheels go round as the trains went by, cannot b imagined, tepeciatly as the streets wero nono too wide and little room would be left after tho tracks wero laid; but both streets wanted tho road, and the one that missed it felt as badly over it. then, as tbe one that got it feels now. When the town got thoroughly wakened up, how ever, as it did when its possibilities through the natural-gas development became ap parent, it set to work to make up for lost time. A new administration came to the front, and it is doubtful if any of the mu nicipalities of the Indiana gas belt worked as vigorously, unitedly and efficiently, during 1SS7 and to develop newly found resources, as Kokomo. Tho Board of Trade took the lead in the matter of at tracting outsido capital and industries, and individual enterprise in the, mat ter of securing bonuses, free land and free gas for manufacturers , who would remove their industries hero, became a marked and prominent feature ol the situation, and the town jumped to tho front as decidedly us it had lingered in tho rear at tho outset. Hero is the list of for- eigmjndnstriea secured in thoso two event ful years: Kokomo. Straw-board Company, from Akron, U., with 8300,(JW) capital, and 125 employes: Newman paier-mill. from Niles, Mich., with KjO.UX) capital, and employes: Bockford bitt and edge-tool-works, from Kockford. 11L. withS.VUXX) capital, and NJ employes; the Howard glass-works, manu facturing fruit jars and bottle?, from fctcu- benville.

SVUXJO capital, and employing WXJ hands during its busy season; the W. G.

C. Moore wood-works, manu facturing finishing, with a capital of $20,000 and 25 employes, and the Morgan brick works, with a capital of $15,000 and 50 em ployes. One or two of tho latter wero de veloped from small industries in existence) here when gas was discovered, but were re organized with such additional capital and equipment as to mako them practically new concerns. The united capital invested in, manufacturing hero then did not exceed $100,000, and the number of operatives em ployed by it did not reach -Wf so that of tho $1,835,000 now invested in manufacturing here, over $l,700,0ii has been secured through the development of natural gas at this point, and of the l,ft) persons who find employment in tbe vari ous factories here, more than 1,700 are in debted for their employment to the. sans source. The citv had 4.000 inhabitants iu 18S0, and claims 12,000 residents at this time. The city directory, just published, contains H,800 names, aud applying tho usual rule of three and one-third for each person listed under the directory svBtem, it would nearly bear out the claim. The population is prob-j ably nearer 11.000 than 12.000, but 1 do not? propose to rai?o an issue with any man con cerning tho population of tbe town in which he lives. In any event, it is a wonderful, and, to all appearances, a permanent growth. The factories that have come hero ave come to stay, and figure out than without a cubic foot of pat their nearness to tho coal supply wonld enable tbem to operate successfully. Certain it is, that a plant like that of tla Diamond Plate-glass Company has not been established here without reference to that contingency. I spent an hour at th works, and came away more impressed with the ideas of magnitude and complete-' uess than I ever was by the arrangement of any other glass manufacturing estab lishment 1 have enronntered. Imagine a connected set of buildings constructed of brick and stone, from one to three storie in heicht, covering nearly eight acres of ground, with railway tracks running from tbe furnaces to carry tbe twenty feet square metal tables on which the molten gla is poured and rolled, and thumped until it looks like a red blanket big enough to cover a megatherium. Then four days of annealing in warm closets before it ii trimmed into squares or parallelograms with a diamond that would not weigh the sixteenth of acarat. and then laid imbedded in cement on fiat wheels that revolve hori zontally from left to right, while smaller horirontal wheel, bearing upon the sur face of the glass, and fed wilh sand and emerv. turn from right to left, and crind the sheets to level planes. 1 hero are a few acres of polishing, tables to come yet, run by a Corliss engine of s3 horse-power. and a mdid welded shaft 10 leet long, which polUa tbs big sbeetH. and lrom there they go to close in Christmas windows, rnarded by heavy boxing and the prayers of insurance ngeuts. Tho largest size reached is 144xlM) inches, and only perfect sheets are ground and polished, those having speck In them being left lor iloor and skylight ue. I would be glad to make further mention of this and. other factories heiv. but it would require a olumoto describe them iu de tail. Tho opalescent glass-works is running yet on orders received as the result of its exhibit at the lat Paris exisition. and its work there carried olf the first med als in competition with the colored gl.isof all countries represented m that depart ment.
