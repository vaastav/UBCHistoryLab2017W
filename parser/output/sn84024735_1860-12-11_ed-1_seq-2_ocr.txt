Tlic 1'resldcuPa message. We have hitherto abstained from commenting at any length on this extraordinary document. Iiau such a message been issued in the commencement of an executive administration, we should have felt it our duty at once to have taken part in the work of a careful examination and exposition of its contents. Cut recognizing it as the act of an executive on the eve of the relinquishment of power, and which, even in the midst of power, has already been renounced by every political party, and by none more decidedly than by the party which elevated it to power; recognizing, too, the now . all important fact that the great political issues of the moment have placed our political rela. lions far beyond the control of the action or inaction of any or all the branches of tho General Government, bringing the sovereign States themselves face to face in the attitude of consultative deliberation or of national conflict; under these circumstances, we have seen little necessity, at this time, for long discussion on the subject of the President's message, since we have not considered it probable that the message can in any manner influence the only arbitrament to which federal relations, by the inevitable force of circumstances, are now referred, that of the tribunal of State actios. On the other hand, however, we are not blind to the existence of an opinion, entertained and expressed by many whose opinions arc well entitled to respect, that if the message shall have no other important effect, it may operate to influence State action itself, in some instances to precipitate, in others to embarrass. If this apprehension be well-founded, then, inJeed it is very important that the intent of the President's message shall be thoroughly sifted i and carefully examined, and that its more sorious errors should be unsparingly exposed.? With a view to rendering some assistance in this work, we lay before our readers the following outline of comment: "14.11 19 * 11 ? io I i?.v 1 . When the President informs us that the present movement at the South is the result, not so much of tho infringements of the Constitu- ; tional rights of Southern States by Northern i Legislatures and the Federal Government, but 1 principally of a pervading apprehension of ser- 1 vile insurrection at the South excited by popu- ' lar agitation at the North; yet that unless ] "Northern "State Legislatures will repeal their ' unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments, without unnecessary delay, it is impossible for 1 any human power to save the L oion."? 1 When the President further asserts that 1 the Congress of the United States has ' never, except in one instance, and r that forty years ago, invaded the Constitutional 3 rights of the South; yet admits immediately v afterwards that the Congress is at this moment 11 actually withholding Constitutional protection from Southern property in the common Terri- 1 tories. When the President further asserts that it is practically as well as constitutionally impossible for a Territorial Legislature to ex- t elude slavery from a Territory, yet admits that t during the past twelve months a Territorial Legislature has maintained such a law on its b statute book. When the President further in- t fjrtns us that his successor, elected under the 1 pledge of solemn promises to exercise all his power and influence for the exclusion of slave s property from the Territories, for the nullifi- b cation of the fugitive slave law, and finally for C the extinction of slavery in the United States, ti must yet be 44 necessarily conservative," and a that for us to believe him capable of doing I what he is pledged to do, "would bo at war s with every principle of justice and of Christian charity." When the President further informs us that secession is not an act of State sore- s reignty, but only of revolutionary resistance, f justifiable only when the Federal Government a shall be guilty of "a deliberate, palpable and p dangerous exercise" of powers not granted by a the Constitution; yetadmits, immediately afterwTNV'Ic tfi.lt fl/?tc of fiAt-nminnnlc i? the Federal Government is powerless to control, will also "justify revolutionary resistance to the Government of tho L'nion." When the President still denies that such resistance witf constitute an act of public war, carried on under the regis of sovereignty; yet admits, ' that any attempt on the part of the Federal Government to suppress such an "insurrection" by force of arms, would constitute not only an act of public war, but one so extraordinary in its nature as to be incommensurate with the limited powers of the Federal Government, When the President further asserts that the Federal Executive is constitutionally and practically armed with full power to enforce Federal laws, even in the face of State resistance; yet admits that Congress may not even puss laws necessary for the execution of these powers; and further admits that the mero action of individuals, taken in advanco and independent of State action, the mere resignation of offices by Federal officials in a State, is of it?elf all-snffi* cient to paralyse the whole power of the Federal Executive and Judiciary within the State. When the President finally recommends to Congress a call for State action through a Convention of all the States, as the only means now available to preserve the Union, or prevent a eonUict. of arms among the States.? From all this maze of contradictions, it is impossible to deduce, with any certainty, the real \ intent and purpose of the President We are necessarily driven to surmise, and to inference. The only result at which we arc enabled to arrive, is summed up in the following cortclu- \ sions: a 1st. The President has endeavored to keep , himself uncommitted, in his executive capacity, ! f to any line of conduct whatever in the event of , State resistance; and now endeavors to furnish i himself, by anticipation, with a pretext of jus- , tificntion or apology for any line of action or ? inaction which he may hereafter find it convc- ( nient to aciopt. ? tiiL The President recognizisc the fact that ? the General Government is powerless to control 5 the exiting crisis, and attempts to demonstrate ( that, although tiic Northern States have palpa- r bly violated the Constitution to the manifest j oppression of the South, united State action in j general convention, may preclude the necessity ^ for, and, in any event, ought to precede sepa- ^ rate State action. t This last recommendation might be worthy i of consideration, were it, at this time, at all j a practicable, ilut, apart from the fact that ! s some of the Southern States have already Je- j f termir.cd on separate Slate action, it is sufli-; ? ciently obvious thai the tone and temper both a ot ihe Watfk Iv.'puhlicm Stales and of their j representatives iu Congress, is such as to pre- j I / elude the possibility of obtaining a call for a Federal Convention. In lliu first instance, at least, there arc now but two alternatives presented to each Southern State?that of resistance by separate State action, and that of entire submission to anti-slavery outrage. Apart from the mere juxtaposition of the President's self-contradictions, the message offers various instances urgently inviting criticism and correction. Of these we take' the opportunity to point out a few : 

CONOKESSIOXAI. ACTION. It sounds strangely in the cars of Southern men, this deliberate assertion on the part of the President of the United States : ';Ao *//igle act has ever passed .Congress, unless ice may pomibly except the Missouri Compromise, impairing, in the slightest degree, t\e rights of the South to their property in slaves." Has the President forgotten that, in IS-lo, an act exactly similar to the Missouri Compromise was applied to slavery in the Territories of the new State of Texas ? that this act was reiterated in 1S50, and has never been repealed hp Conn-rest; ? "?o Has the President forgotten that, in ISoO, property in slaves was directly assailed in the District of Columbia, and lues ever since been oppressed, under a disabling act of Congress? Has he forgotten, too, that in the same year, Congress and the President resorted to a combination of squatter-sovereignty, anarchy and military dictation, to exclude slave property from valuable employment in the gold mines of California '! Has the President forgotten that, in 18o4, Congress repealed a code of laws protecting slave property in Kansas and Nebraska, leaving such property to a great extent without legal protection Again. Does the President pretend that Congress may not impair the light of slave property by unfriendly inaction, as well as by bostile action ? And is not slave property, at this moment, subjected to oppression through the act of an agent of Congress, whose usurpation of power is tolerated by Congress : SOVKItElCX 

I'OWUI!. It tells sudlv for the spread of the doctrine of popular government, when a President of the greatest republic ever known m the world gravely informs us. in a public document, that the powers to coin money, declare war, make peace, concludo treaties, regulate commerce, Ac. ?4embrace the eery hiyh'etl attributes "/ notional sovereignty." Yet, Mr. Buchanan, it seems, has never yet imagined, that in this country, the power to coin money, or to declare war is /"<( a sovereign power. Grotius indeed calls each of these a sovereign power. 60 does Yattel. So do all Kuropcan, and too many American writers 01: public law. But, thank God, the philosophy of government, in this land of ours, lias taken a giant's stride beyond all the imaginings of Grotius and Yattel, and all the other publicists combined. In effect and in law, throughout all those Inifcd States of America, the power to coin money is no more a sovereign power than is the power to issue a county magistrate's warrant, or to affix a notarial seal. Towering far above the power of peace and war, of coining tnonev or regulating commerce, there is n governmental power which embraces the sole and peculiar iltribute of supremacy. There is one sovereign power, and hut one, and. that power is :he Constitctjon-.maui.nu powkk. Sovereign power, one and inseparable, reljains with the people of each Stale. They nay separate and distribute at will the suborlinate powers of national or municipal governnent, but, wherever placed, these powers still einain merely subsidiary and subordinate, and it all times subjected to that sovereign power vhich constituted and delegated, and may at my time withdraw or resume them. Indeed, the President seems to have an inking of this great truth, when lie says: "To the extent of the delegated powers, the Constitution of the United States is as much a iart of the Constitution of each State, and is as linding upon its people, as though it had been cxtually inserted therein." Exactly. And the people of a Slate, asscui>led in Convention, may, at any time, abrogate heir State Constitution, in whole or in pari. 'his is sovereign power. James Madison has, indeed, ably and coucluively demonstrated that there is a difference ictween this "federal clause" of each State Constitution, and every other clause, which mist be considered whenever the question of brogation or amendment shall arise. The 'resident evidently misunderstands Mr. Madion's masterly exposition. .mr. madison's doctiunk. It is with much regret that we see the Preident adopting, liowevcr unadvisedly-, the wilul and wicked perversions which Federalist ,nd Black Republican newspapers are now applying to the Virginia doctrine of State Rights, s expounded by James Madison. A few words will suffice to explain and to indicate this doctrine. Mr. Madison held, that he diilerence between each State Government .nd the Federal Governments, consists in the act that, while the State Government is the eparate agent of one State, the Federal Gc crnmcnt is the common agent of ali the States. L'he sovereign people of each State, through heir State Constitution, have created a State Government, and delegated to it certain muni:ipal powers. The same sovereign people have, hrough the Federal Constitution, delegated to he Federal Government certain other municipal powers. That they may, at any time, or in any pretext, or without pretext, abrogate heir State Constitution, dismiss their State Government and erect another in its place, lone can deny, or has ever ventured to dispute. Jut the Federal Constitution embodies an elenent unknown to the State Constitution?the dement of national compact. Xo State, indeed, has parted with any attribute of her sovereignty. But each sovc eign State, on entering the Union, did so, with he necessarily implied compact, that she would preserve the Union, so long as her associate states should respect the conditions of the joinpact, and so long as her people should not >c subjected to intolerable oppression, constiutional or unconstitutional. This compact, lowever, is upheld by no guarantee, save that" if the plighted faith of State Sovereignty.? L'he Sovereign States were subjected to the llnfoflz-m nf tin nnmninn n?4nfr?r In nf nfraction of the Constitution or ol oppression >f any sort, real or supposed, each State, for jerself, must be the judge of the infraction ind of the mode and measure of redress. Each nust judge for herself, and act for herself?responsible only before the great tribunal of naions. If one State shall say to the other states: "You have, through your State governments, or through our common federal lgents, violated the Constitutional compact? >r even, without violating express compacts, lubjected my people to oppression?1 so judge, ind my mode and measure of redress is to ahiolve myself from this compact." In such case, j he other States may say : "We have an equal ight to judge; and our judgment is, that we i.vve respected the compact, and have not optrcssed your people. We judge, moreover, hat you have sought a false pretext by which o dissolve the compact; that this is an net of tad faith towards us, and one to which we will iot submit." Thus a conflict of judgment may rise among the Sovereign States, and when it o arises, it must be calmed by forbearance, on he one side, or on the other, or on both sides; 1 r it must be settled by formal agreement ' mong the States?or, it must result not in ; revolution" in the narrow sense of the word. i , >ut in puljlic war, formally declared by State ! < Sovereignties and conducted according ?o tl "jus bcllC of nations. , This is the doctrine of James Madison, doctrine which not only upholds the right < secession, but which claims for each Sovereig State the right to employ any mode or me sure of redress?whether it be by secessh from the Union?or the bolder policy of a pealing to arms* and declaring war again other Suites to vindicate her right of soy reignty and equality in the Union. To deduce from this, any denial of theeuti sovereignty of a State, Mr. Buchanan mu first resort to a perverted statement of i teachings. And we have already shown, th in order to prove any division or concession . ?i__ n,, ouue sovereignly, no ihum icuvunui mv t-t, ocrutic doctrine of sovereign right, and ha recourse to another and a foreign doctri which draws its teaching from the dogma the divine right of Kings. ? Letter lioin Judge Lougstrect. The following able and well-timed letti from % true Southern patriot, who has spe the greater portion of a long and vert* usef life in the service of his country?dischargit meanwhile, with highest honor, various iuipe tant public oflices?will attract deserved atte tion from all our readers: To the Editors of the Enqvirer: Coi.i'.miua, S. C., Dec. C, 1800. (I'entleinen :?Allow me a small space in yoi paper to disabuse the minds of Virginians a very false impression which they have of tl secession movement in this State. Almost: your distinguished correspondents sneak of as a thing gottcn up by politicians, and i being entirely under their control. Never wi there a greater mistake. It is the result one universal outburst of indignation on tl part of the people, at Lincoln's election?01 spontaneous and almost unanimous resolv from the mountains to the sea-board, that the never would come under Black Republic? rule. Sirs, you never saw anything like it; never saw anything like it; the world nev saw anything like it.

They gatl er in multitudes, find out where a speaker i visit him, and compel hiin to speak; and the have not found one yet bold enough to denoum secession?separate secession?before them.And yet there is no tumult, save the tumult i applause; no riotous conduct, no strife, i heart-burning?nay, quite the reverse. It all smiles, joy and good fellowship. The [ meetings are generally at night; in the da every man is quietly at his business, and even thing is going smoothly on.

Why do the)* speak of her a though they thought she was cxperimentin with the other States, or trying to force Diet to a bitter alternative. When she took he stand I do not believe she expected the co-opt ration of an)* other State. I am sure she look cd for no such thing from Virginia. In lSi?; she sought co-operation with Georgia; and sh was very courteously dismissed. In 1830 sh sought co-operation at Nashville, with an tn nther Southern States. She found no encou ragcment there. In 1 SCO she offered eo-opc ration to Virginia; and she was delicately dis missed. What ground of hope hud she tha any other State in the Union would make com raon cause with her in this movement';' Th truth of the matter is that the impulse whicl moves her, moves seven-tenths of the peopl of the South. Put up your strongest men an; where in Virginia, before a large multitude o her unaspiring people; let them propose tem porizing resolutions, and let the most unpopu lar man in the assembly offer as a substi tute, resolutions for immediate secession; am mark the effect of the two upon the people You will see every sign of favoritism to th last, and in three instances out of live the; will adopt the last with acclamation. Th whole country is stirred from Maryland to Tex as. Why is this? It is because every bod; knows what Black Republicanism is, and wha they arc to look for from it. What is there ti consult about, to study about, to debate about To sec whether wc cannot get guaranties of fu ture good conduct from them? The peopl know full well they will give no such guaran ties in the first place, nor keep them if given in the second. A gang of self-infuriated fnna tics who have been tormenting the South fo thirty years, and threatening worse thing than they have perpetrated, have now all pow er in their hands. How much deliberation d the people want to decide whether they wil live under them or not? A. II.

Enqvirtr: The IS in i> i of .vi-Mtion. a The President of the Union, in his late iiies! sage, has tried to sustain his opposition to scj cession, as a remedy of right under the Con;n : stitution, by resort to the articles of confederaa j tion. in Permit me U? show, through your c-lumns, that it was un unhappy reference. P" The history of the adoption of the Constitute tion, will show that the "perpetual Union," e. j under the confederation on which so much stress is laid, was broken up by the power of the States abrogating and annulling it, as contrary rb j to its provisions, and in defiance of the terms 'St ! of that Union. It was done by an Act of Seits I reunion. The Constitution under which we at j live, was the result of an exercise of a flight j of Secession, precedent to an act of new j Union. n-1 How then was it a ptrpetuul Union?indisvo soluble forever:' And if not, how is the prenc sent Union, which, in no part of the Constitution, is declared to be perpetual, to be bold as perpetual and indissoluble'! i Look at the facts. The articles of confederation and of jn-rpetuul Unicn, was a compact between thirteen :r, Stnten, of which Rhode Island was one. It was nt 'i "league," and so declared on its face to be. uj It was agreed by the 15th Article, that there should not be "any alteration at any time" in *6 any of the articles." unless such alteration be .r. 1,,.pnii'Tcss of the United States, n- and be afterwards confirmed by the* Lcjislalatures of every State." It is apparent by thi< provision, iluit lliis "perpetual Union" conlii not be altered in respect of the Articles on which it rested, within out. the consent of each and every State. Now of could I (relet, of them, without breach of comic pact, change the terms of conlcderation, against ill the will of the thirteenth.' it Now, 1 assert, that (icelrc of the thirteen did as form the present Co-*! it'll ion, without the is thirteenth: and that the thirteenth was neither of in the convention which framed the Constitute tion, nor became a member of the present ie Union until more than a year after it went into o, operation. Rhode Island was that State, and >y was left alone by Iter twelve sisters; and did in not join them until May -!t, IT'.'O; and thus the 1 "Perpetual Union," of which we hear so much, er was put an end In lev years after it was established; and a new one was framed without the r- leave or assent of all the Slates, against the n. will of anyone of which that very Union prop. vided its articles should not lie changed, t- But, further. North Carolina ratified the preh sent Constitution November "1,17-SP; and thus s, she, too, was left by her confederates, who had, ;v without her assent, put an end to the "Per/e petual Union," as to her, also. ? But, still Inrlhcr. The new Constitution proof vided it should go into operation if nine States 10 out of the thirteen ratified it, as between those is only, however, who did ratify it. Tints it proir vided, thatybi/r confederates might he left, by y the nine, to the old articles, by which the nine members of the new Union would cease to be i, bo u nil. Suppose four had refused to ratify?the nine y ratifying Stales would have formed a now ir Union?while the four dissenters would still be i. in the old "Perpetual Union!.'" o Now I want any one to tell me, how the nine s ?ot rid of the bond of tiie "Perpetual Union?" g They were members of it. It was declared 11 perpetual. The Constitution they adopted was r not an amendment of the old articles?oerause i. not adopted as I hey prescribe/. And yet the :- nine ceased to lie in the old Confederacy, and 3 had formed a new one. How did they get out e of the old into the new? Tluy adopted the e new, us Sovereign State"', flow did they get e out of the old compact? 1 answer?By Secession ! They seceded i- from the Perpetual Union. i- Why? Because they in their Sovereign t pleasure chose to do so. They seceded, and . formed another Union. They broke up a pere petual Union, as they expressly agreed it should a be, and formed one which more nearly conf? formed to the necessities of their condition. y And who could gainsn\* the will ??t* sovereign f contracting States ? Mr. Madison, in the 40th number of the i-Vd. erakst, admits the Convention in this respect . violated the articles of confederal ion. lie deI fends it on the ground that forms prosr;bcd for amendment, 111 list give way to the "IranL. srendent and precious right >!' the people to e abolish or alter their governments, as to theni c shall seem most likely to ailect their safety and . happiness!" p Xow, 1 submit, it this "transcendent and t precious right," was higher than the obligation 0 of the perpetual Union ; il* the right to se? cede was paramount to such a bond; upon i- what reason is it that the present broken Oone stitHtion can hold sovereignties, who adopted i. it upon a breach of a perpetual bond. <>y virtue of their sovereign will? So much for this argument. r What shall he said of the remainder ot it? s The President says the Constitution is bro. ken. The Supreme Court have said so; and it 0 is supposed to be the final arbiter?(which 1 II deny.) We say and feel it has been broken in every purl, and trampled under the feet of ruffians of the higher law,from the President elect and his associates, down to the rabble that fill the ranks of the Wide Awake Organizali tion. n A bargain broken by one parly ceases to bind the other, says Mr. Webster. 1 How then is Virginia or Carolina bound by a a compact to Vermont or Massaclmselt. which i- have broken it? Who can deny the light to cancel by the faithful adherents to the compact j in such a case? .Shall the faithless violators do so? and talk of coercion? e If the bond he cancelled, where is the Union?

For many years our section lias, indirectly, j borne the chief burdens of the General Goveminent, without having our proportionate share of its benefits; and we have fallen into a | li.ved and hoplvlcss inequality, in this respect, j A party at the North, avowedly bent on the destruction of our property?and, with it, of our industry and our homes?has now acquired power enough in the popular vote to elect a chief Magistrate of their own sort; and we are now to be brought under the slow and silent, but ? .. i sure process m rum, u and oppression so feelingly referred to in scripture?"They that hated them ruled over thcin." For thirty years or more, in every variety of l'onn, our section lues argued, remonstrated, protested, till all the remedies of that nature, which it becomes us to use, have been exhausted and have failed. In our case forbearance is no longer a virtue ; submission will be ruin. I cannot doubt, therefore, that it is the right and duty of the people of the shareholding Slates to withdraw from this Union, and to form a government of their own, suited to their wants. The period, the occasion, the manner of doing this, belongs to the statesmen of the country?to the Convention, as expressing the will of the people. Hitherto 1 have been a silent spectator of public .1 flairs, occupied fully in my own chosen sphere. In tlus position it is my decided wish to remain. Vet, I am not unwilling to bear the responsibility of expressing, on proper occasions, the opinions and views I hold; and it certainly does not become any citizen to say beforehand that he would refuse his services, though demanded by the people in times of stern dilliculty. As f am not conscious of deserving to be entrusted with the management of public affairs, especially at a crisis so momentous as this, I cannot expect any such expression of the public will, as .should lay on me an imperative sense of duty to suffer myself to be drawn into the councils of the Stale. P.. 

MAXJ.Y. Tl\scai.o.>sa. Nov. 20th, I -SCO. L'xivcijsin nr Alaiuju, i -November 10, IStiO. \ To Me.?as. A. S. Nicholson arid others: At a time like this, the people ought to feel that they have the right to put their hands upon any man, and assign hint such service as may he most conducive to the public good; and every citizen should hold himself in readiness to yield a willing obedience to the popular voice. Molding this opinion, 1 should of course servo ! my countrymen to the best of my ability, if il | were their desire, expressed at the ballot-box, | that 1 -.hould represent them in the Convention ; which is shortly to be called, lint 1 am per-j j sonally unknown to the great majority ol the j voters of Tuscaloosa county, and I have no reason to suppose that they would sustain your partial e.-timatu of my titness to serve them, unless 1 could enter upon a thorough canvass of the county. To undertake this, would invoic a culpable neglect of my duties to the Uni versitv; and tbereloro, with a due appreciation i of the confidence you repose in me, I must re- I spcctfull)' withhold the use of my muni', ::s a j candidate for the Convention. I regret that I cannot hear a more active | part in the present crisis of onr affairs. Our ! destiny as a people hnn;s suspended upon the j issue of this approaching election. .Standing i aloof from party politics as 1 have ever done, ! animated hy none of thi angry passions a.va- i kened by party strife, anl occupying a retired j position from which I lave been nolo with j calmness to watch the tendency of things, it is iny deliberate conviction, that all is hwt if we submit to the dominion of.the Black Rcpuhlican party. 1 ?J?? not see the sun shining in Heaven more plainly than Isce, that prompt, deceded, and effectual resistince by skcession*. is the only path of safety anJ honor.

OAKLAND - w-O-l ! The Crisis. "If hy your arts you liar-put ilic waterIn this nilJ roar, allay lliini."?[ 1 erupt*!. All men possessed of a particle of brains j can appreciate the crisis th.'t is now upon the j country. The whole commercial and manu-1 factoring interest in the Xo-th is perfectly d-> j stroyed. There appears tr he "no balm in ! Gilead" that will heal its wounds. The tariff cry is no longer heard, bv-ansc all men have at last learned that even tin "highest protective tariff is worthless" when there is no market. The banks, the pet institutions of the Xorth, arc* worse than useless?the first to take the alarm, they add, by their weakness and their j timidity, to the terrors of the panic. Stocks are tumbling in every direction, and burying in their ruins the accumulated fortunes of years of industry, 'flic working classes are thrown by thousands and lens of thousands out of employment, and stern winter, with his icy tread and chill terrors, is upon the industrious poor, carrying hunger and want to their cold hearthstones. Hundreds of millions of property at the Xorth have been already sacrificed to the .Moloch of fanatical Abolitionism, and. "the triI Itmplis of Republicanism thus far." At the ! South wc have secession and revolut ion, and in perspective internecine war. and all its attendant horrors; that spirit of resistance brought about by the aggressions of the North upon the institutions and interests of the South, so that I forbearance lias ceased to be a virtue, and cnl| ruinating in a feeling of hostility produced by j ] the "liist law of Nature," self-pres?r ration? | i which makes the dissolution <1 the Union such [ j a moral certainty that no man will eat lus j Christmas dinner in the United States. ' For these results, and for this state of things. ! we arc indebted to the maddened ambition tf [ the Republican party, which, by its falsehoods, | its deception and its treason, has thrust upon the nation a man for tiie Chief Magistracy j whose record has pledged hiin to the abolition ! idea that the country "cannot remain one-hull i free and the other half slave; it must become j either one or the other." I A man who, while in a minority of nearly j one million of votes of iho people, and who ! received no single doctoral vole in 15 States of j the Confederacy,is thrust upon thecountry with : but one single idea, and that a sectional one? j to wit: tIre extinction of slavery. In the midst of this general picture of misery and ilisties?, wc have the picture of the defeated national conservative Union and I'onto| cratie party lying powerless at the f.-ct of she I victors, while the lenders of til- triumphant I Clack Republican party, dead to every feeling i of sympathy for the snlfering masses, and in a j struggle fur the spoils ??f office. reckless as to i all future consequences, only anxious to keep j up the system of fraud and deception which ; has brought them into power, until they shall | he able to clutch the glittering guerdon which j rewards iheir treason. | We have warned the country < ! the uangt-rs I now upon us, we appealed to the conservative I patnotism of the nation. We warned and ap| pealed in vain. We of the Democratic party are now in a worse than Babylonish captivity. We say 10 our conquerors.

JONATHAN HUNTER, Cl.'n, J K. R. Macon, Sec'ry. For the Fn'juircr. .tii AiiiSeut.le Adjustment. Upon an examination of the papers in th case of Pitts vs. Cast is, 1 have come to th conclusion that the controversy between th parties ought to t.e settled by agreement, am it seems only to want the intervention o some friend, and disintere.-t 'd nerson to brim about thai result. The letter <#l'tin; 2'Jth July. 16-7, constitute1 the gravamen ?>f tiie plaintiff's ease; lint it i: obvious that iltis letter was written-under tin excitement nl' pa.-.-: ion occasioned hy a belie on the part of the defendant that the duei of the "1st day of I Jet-ember, 16-iu. mi pit tut a general warranty on the part of John Custis, [ one of the "grantors, and was so written designedly by the plaintiff. This plainly appears upon the l'.iceof the letter itself, for the writer expressly declares his readiness to take back the offensive words, and make ail honorable amends when he shall be disabused of that j belief. The plaintiff seems to concede ibis [ state of the case because in -undry pin ts of the correspondence filed of record, "he expressed the belief that the offensive charges proceeded from the hasty convictions of a passionate uiim! under the delusion of error. k icsnlts, therefore, that the offensive charges did not spring from malice or any wicked design, falsely to asperse or injure the plaintilf. This living so it is n case lor explanation and nothing has prevented ils termination in that way hut dillicuities growing out <-f certain notions of etiquette, which should no longer interpose their impediments. Whether the deed does in fact import a general warranty iun exceedingly don huh! question, and lawyers have expressed different opinions upon it.? And whatever be its true legal interpretation, it plainly appears from the correspondence alrcady referred to, that the plaintiff did not design it to have that dlccf. It seems to me that the covenant inr-ciledor, the part of the trustees that they had a good right to convey, strictly interpreted, subjects them t-i th<- liability of making good the title against tiie claim of dower, on the part of the wife of the grantor of the deed of trust, under which tiie land was sold; and yet this is a consequence not contemplated by them, and not inf.triilitd !?% llif* Tii'imtllV WI It'll l\t? W Hit 13 till? deed ; and it is probable thai the covenant against incumbrance inserted on the part of John (.'nstis, was only intended as a si ent ity against the asset lion of any claim to subject the land then alter lor any part of the original purchase money that might remain unpaid after the appropriation of tin* purchase money obtained from W". I!. Puts. There is in fact no delect of tit it: to the land; it was liable to sale for the purchase money, and the widow of the first purchaser was only dowablo of the excess of the proceeds of sale, attc-r defraying the costs nf sale and the payment of the purchase money, when in fact the proceeds of sale fell short of meeting these liabilities. In this State of the case all that is necessary to bring the parties to an amicable settlement of the matters in controversy, is to bring them to a personal acknowledgment to each other of established facts. To remove the embarrasmcnt which the estranged and excited feelings of the parties produces, I propose that in consideration of the premises the defendant withdraw his pleas of justification, ami retract the offensive charge* contained in his letter, that the suit be dismissed at his costs, and that the pleas of justification, the correspondence and the depositions on both sides be withdrawn from file and destroyed. In fact, the plaintiff has sustained no actual injury from the injurious imputations: he lias been recently re-elected bv an increased majority to. the Judicial ofiiee, and the defend i:it was not moved to cast the imputations by false or malicious motives, so that both elements are wanting to the case, necessary to authorize ? jury to award e.xrmi pi,ire damages; and if it were otherwise, the | plaintiff disclaims any desire to make gain out of the controversy, ll seems to me, then fore, that the terms (imposed ate such as embody a settlement to which both parties can honorably accede. If the plaintiff will signify iii- a<-c>it to this form of settlement b\ a note :-> that written at the foot of i-iis m< monoidum, the defend--i-i n o. i?. ant win <in me same, ;i..m mi- " ii in tin: cause evidence of this agreement ??f tile mailers in emit i over, v between them.
