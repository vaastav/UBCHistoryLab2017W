Expressions of Opinion by Senators | and Representatives on tho Con tents of the Message—Estimates of Appropriations Needed to Defray the Expenses of the Governmont for the Fiscal lear 1894-03. Special to tho RcCQRD-UATOKi Washington, Dec. 4.—The first Senate session of the Fifty-third Cougress assem bled at noon. After the Vice-President's gavel fell the blind Chaplain was led to the desk, and he delivered an eloquent prayer. The roll-call showed fifty-six Senators present. After the passage of the usual resolu tion notifying the House of the meeting of the Senate, and the appointment of a committee to join a like committee from the House to wait on the President and notify him of the assembling of Congress, and one fixing the time of meeting at noon each day, the Senate took a recess of an hour to enable the committee to wait on the President. At the expiuuion of the recess the Sen ate reconvened. A message was received from the House of the appointment of a committee to wait on the President. Another recess of twenty minutes was taken. < m reassembling the committee to wait on the President announced the accom plishment of its duty and that the Presi dent would at once communicate with the Senate. Secretary Pruden then stepped forward and delivered the message to the Vice- President, who laid it before the Senate, and Secretary Cox at once began its read ing. All present, with few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading began. The reading was concluded at '■'> o'clock, having occupied one hour and a half. Dolph immediately rose and sail there had been distributed in the Senate printed copies of what purported to be the mes sage of the President, in which page nine and part of page ten are devoted to Ha waii. He did not hear that portion read lrom the desk. He desired to know, and thought the country did also, whether that part was inadvertently or purposely omitted by the Secretary, or whether the copies which had been circulated were not true copies of tho message. The Vice-President responded that that Eortion of the message relating to Hawaii ad been inadvertently omitted by the Secretary, and directed that it be read. This was done, and Dolph gave notice that he would on to-morrow address the {Senate on that part of the message. The message was ordered to lie ou the table. Numerous petitions were presented, and many bills were introduced aud re ferred. A joint resolution permitting Colonel Anson Hills, I . S.

Washington, Dec. 4.—Views of the members oi both houses concerning the message arc freely expressed. blx-Speaker Reed said: "it is exceed ingly disappointing, both In matter and nianner.

WILL NOT COMMIT HIMSELF. Indianapolis, Dec. 4.—Ex-President Harrison declined to talk about the mes sage. "The impropriety ofcan ex-Presi dent discussing publicly a President's message," said he, "is palpable, and 1 do not earo to do so. lam a Republican aud 1 resident Cleveland is a Democrat, con sequently we diner radically in views and opinions, and his suggestions and recommendations are not in accordance With my ideas. I notice, however, that he goes down the line of the departments and treats of them fully. Its length, too, is greater than the average message." 

GOVERNMENT EXPENSES. Estimates For tho Appropriations For Che -Next Fiscal Year. Washington, Dec. 4.—Tho book of estimates for the appropriations for the fiscal year of 1894 and 1895 was scut to Congress to-day. The amount estimated as necessary to carry on the Government for the fiscal year is $111,879,041, against estimates for 1893-94 of §421,512,215 and appropriations for 189J of $432,456,526. The estimates for 1895 are made up as fol lows: Executive, legislative, ,723; State, §1,833,638; Treasury, $120/155,980; War, $55,277,499; Navy, $28. -->'•■-*, 77-i: Interior, 1,220; Postoffice, 883,970,866; Agricultural, $2,233,843; Labor, 8161,870; Justice, $6,273,345; enforcement of the Chinese Exclusion Act. $350,000; repairs and preserving public buildings, $225,000; total for public buildings under tho Treasury Department, $1,659,135; rivers and harbors, 812,510,000, an esti mated increase over the appropriations of the current year; of this amount $ 000 is expended upon works directed by Congress. In the pension appropriations tiie principal changes are a reduction of in pension payment. ALIEN CONTRACT LAW. Decision Rendered by tho United States Supreme Court. Washington, Dec. 4.—The Supreme Court rendered an opinion to-day which, while affirming tho constitutionality of the alien contract labor law, will em barrass the practical enforcement of the law. The question came up on the ap peal of Joseph Lees and John S. Lees from a decision of the United States Cir cuit Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, lining them $1,000 for importing Frederick Graham of England to perform labor iv Millbridgeport, Pa. The court holds the Act valid, but when the accused parties were compelled to give evidence against themselves in a criminal proceeding their constitutional rights were violated, and hence reverses tho decision.

Above Aii Things, They Must Be' Young, Clara Qua'.itz' Experience — Zs'oorl of Beginning l'ariy to Obtain Flexi bility and Strength. Theoretically the ballet dancer is an ethereal being who spins through lifo on r dainty toes with an airy grace that is devoi.i of all physical ef : -a creature. light as ;iir, with noth ing in common with her fellow-mortals. This is one conception. ' m the other hand, the bullet dancer is maligned as an aged, decrepit personage, s;;:is hair, sane teeth, sans everything, sporting in the lime-light's glare on ach ing iirnbs in padded tights and borrowed smiles for the adoration only of the cal low and tiie senile. And this in as untrue as the other. Now, having been in the ballot all my i life, 1 would like to correct some er- ! teous impressions concerning an art I that ranks with the highest. Believe me, ! i what 1 atn going to write is solemn truth ! o: fancy. In the tirst place—and this is lor the btM: mentioned callow and rs—the successful ballet dancer most bu a strong, agile, young—I .; on tiie young—woman who ■ c Loves to dance an'l nod liow to danuet She must keej - " .ii condition without any is not a fairy, nor an Ln spite of all illusions to tiie contrary, would cr shells if compelled on them, and she is not supported tiie air bj inty gauze drapery I I that i her waist. In Git. she is I like other young women, \ rd work and constant prac- i c toughened her muscles and : limbered her joint-;. And when she grows old—about half 1 as the funny paragraphers would make us all out io be—she retires and her children succeed her; for ballet dancing is more than any other, an hereditary j art. There is a great deal of pleasure in bal let dancing, and a great deal more of hard work. 1 began the latter when 5 years of and I cannot stop until the day comes when 1 snail retire. One must begin very young in order to obtain the proper Itexi. v and strength required in ballet dancing. Alter the eighth year the limbs too fixed to yield to training. I bejzau, as i said, at live, and for two •thing except what would ich the cords, in order to get the full est, freest movement oi' the limbs. I exercises consisted of swinging the leg in ! j front aod to the side aud rear, care being j SACRAMENTO T>APVr RECOBD-TTyTO^ TTXESDAT, BiJCEMBEK 5, 1893.--SIX PAGES. global gaitiurt ff<m»pgy« Highest of ail in Leavening Power.—Latest U. S. Gov't P-eport ABSdIUTEOf PUHE taken that the leg was always held per lei-tly straight and that each limb should become perfectly independent of the rest of the body. There is this difference be tween ballet dancing and "high kicking" —tho former consists of absolute inde pendent movements, the latter is the re sult, of ti continuation of movements that call into action all the muscles of the body. Tho high kicker shoots her foot up suddenly in the air, maintaining an equilibrium by bending the back and bead. None of the movements of a ballet dancer is sudden. In the school we are taught to be deliberate. Deliberation moans grace, but it is attended only by constant practice, for the strain is intense. The exercises in the school makes the muscle.-, of the leg and lower trunk very Btrong and hard, but the muscles of tho upper part of the body are subjected to an entirely different course of training. It is not strength, but absolute ease, that is desired. Hands, arms and shoulders are subjected to what tho Delsarte people call the devitalization process. It is this that gives to the ballot dancers, whose lower limbs are being subjected to the most intense strain, the appearance of airy lightness that makes them seem to bo floating about the stage as though blown by a breath of wind. There is a constant upward motion in the efforts of the ballet dancer, which may i>e better appreciated by comparing her efforts with those of the jig dancer, who employs a constant downward mo tion. It requires long practice before one is able to take up the art of toeing. It is, of course, the most difficult task of all. And iet mo say a word right now to the young women with small, delicately arched feet, who imagine they could pirouette like a promiuro assohua just because they hap pen to bo light on their feet aud tireless dancers in the ballroom. Tho woman who possesses a high instep cannot becomo a good ballot dancer, because she can never toe properly. When I began to too my feet wore almost llat, the instep being \ cry low. This flatness meant strong muscular development, that was abso lutely necessary ior the fearful strain of my solo dancing. Constant practice in toeing rounds out the flatness into a con siderable arch, but it is an arch of much more than ordinary strength; one that has been forced by the persistent tension of the muscles, and that will sustain one in exercise that would utterly break down the natural and nfuch-prized arch of the society girl's delicate foot. After I had spent live years in th man school 1 studied for a year under a master of the French school of posing. Then came a year under an Italian mas ter, who taught me toeing and turning. Then I had mastered the rudiments of the art. Since then 1 have practiced every day of my life except Sunday, which is iudeed a day of rest for me. The minute 1 leave my bed in the morning, aud before 1 have had anything to oat, I don a loose garment, like a mod ern bathing suit, with lights and blouse, and an old pair of ballet shoes. Then, for nearly an hour, I go through the old exercises of my school days in order to loosen the knees, hips and shoulders and lend strength, grace and firmness to the limbs. Frequently, after breakfast. I go over to the stage of Roster <.V ilial's and prac tice my solo dances in the ballet of "Ver sailles," particularly tho adagio move ment, which is tho most trying of all. 1 keep pretty quiet for the rest of the day, for nay work at night is most arduous, and 1 have to keep in the best of condi tion. Even after one lias become a premiere she is still in the hands of a teacher. I tind it necessary to go to a ballet-ma&>tJßr every now and then in order to bo cor rected of some bad habit. For instance, if I should go to the per formauce of "Versailles" some night in a tired condition, in pirouetting about the stage I would find the strength of my logs insufficient to keep mo whirling about, instinctively I would assist the tired muscles by throwing my arms about to give momentum to the body. The motion at drst would be scarcely perceptible, but bad habits grow rapidly, and the next night the arm motion would be more noticeable. After a while it would materially spoil my work, winch would lack ease aud grace. The ballet-master corrects all this. Like the musician, whose quick ear detects the slightest flatness, his trained eye sees tho defect before it is too late and hours ol practice finally remedies it. So you see it is not altogether a fairy existi nee nor all late suppers and cham pagne—but work, work, work, that falls to the lot even of the premiere. Nor could tho grandmothers of the ballet, of whom the paragraphera delight to joke, over Biaud such a routine. —Clara (^ualitz in Nov.- Voile World. Odd Freaks of Collectors.

Some Interesting Notes on Mar shal McXlahoo. lie Was a Good Husband and Father— His Life in Algeria — Opposed to Cardinal LavUgerle's Proselytlnc Schemes—A Iliuh Spirit and a Swoot Nature, The death of Marshal MacMahon has in no decree dainpod tho festal spirit which the visit of tho Russian naval olli cers has called forth, says tho Paris cor respondent of the New York '/', It has only added another grand Bpecta cle, which, to them, will bo a new one. MacMahon was just and kind and could be generous, though be had an Irish ca pacity for harboring rancor against dis honest persons who injured him. One might depend both upon his love and hatred. However, as ho was constantly sounding his conscience, he took pains not to let the latter feeling hurry him into injustice, or blind his eyes to the truth. He had also, associated with tho prido of race and situation, an humble spirit which led him to mistrust himself, and made him prone to obey commands and circumstances rather than the prompt ings of his own wishes. Thy Marshal was allectionate in his family relations, and truly the husband of one wile. His fidelity in this respect was also an Irish characteristic, and exposed him in tho army to the irony of other officers of his standing. Another Irish quality was his capacity to go a long time without food and not feel the weaker lor it. ji always a plain liver, and, when ha bad urgent military or other work to get through, preferred to a set meal, a bis cuit with a little whisky and water. His table, by his wish, was plainly fee \ preferring a few good simple dishes to a variety of palate-tickling and liver-ex citing ones. Toward his children he was all sweetness. He was, in 1858, In a minority of one in tho Imperial Seuutu, of which he was a member, against a law which gave the Emperor power to transport suspects to Ceyenno untried. The division over, be was universally shunned by ins fellow- Senators, liio late hue de Broglie, who was a man of a good deal of luck bone, called on MaoMahon to congratulate him on the great moral courage evinced in his vote. MacMahon said; "IfeltcaU by my conscience to speak and vote :is 1 did. Whenever 1 disregard a call oi con j 1 do not dare to embrace my children." This Baying gives the key note of the Marshal's character and i-;t --reer. Honor in France is a conventional virtue born of social re.iuirement.-j, and distinct from honesty and duty. Mao- Mahon never admitted the distinction, tie maintained that if one was careful to do one's duty under all circumstances one's honor would be without a stain. The moral complexion of MacMahon, like his physiogomy and physique, was not French but Irish. He had the high spirit and the "spunk" of an Irish gen tleman, the in difference, alter a certain point, for money which one BO often sues in Ireland. His detestation of indecency and of mean stinginess was very Irish and not French. He had Irish Catholic piety, but was far from being a clerical, aud his never having taken his politics from Koine is ono of the reasons why the King of Italy showed such deep sympa thy for him aiter ho retired to private lilt 1. MacMahou as (loverncr-* leneral ot Algeria, fought hard against the late Pope,the hmperor and Empress Eugenic and Cardinal Lavigerie lor the consci ences and parental rights of the Arabs to be respected. He never forgave the Car dinal nis attempts to proselytize Aral) children against tho wish of their parents and tho Marshal's orders, and spoke of him to the last as an intriguer who wanted to become I'rimate oi ail Africa and make a largo lortuno by getting grants of Land, gutting African catechumens to work them, and sending round in France tho begging-bag to collect money for his farms and neophytes. MacMahon kept up splendid state as Governor-General of Aigerie. There- was no simpler man in his homo life, and bis indifference to show and luxury was re markable. But when ho lilied any great public situation ho instinctively went 111 for magnificence in his dinners, balls, general surroundings and equipages, spending every cent uf his salary and ins and his wife's private incomes. He even went in debt at the Elysee, and must have ended his life in poverty had his wife not unexpectedly inherited t from au Irish relative, for her two grand9 mothers were Irish women. The Mar shal was deemed the first figure at the coronation of the late hlmperor William as King of Prussia, at Koenigsberg. His equipage eclipsed every other. .Nobody had a better eye to tho points ofacar riago or a saddle horse, and he looked sharply to see that his grooms and stable men did tiioir duly. His humility uid not prevent him taking a high view of himself as tho chief ol the Government when ho was at th'j Elysee. Persons of royal birth seemed wanting in presence beside him there. His private life was unaffected and tb:it of a high hearted Christian soldier and gentleman. As a Marshal of Franco ho was considered to bo in active service, but practically was not. Having been head of the State lie would aecopt no j>ai<i office however high, and accordingly, when General Faiduorde died, declined the Grand Chancellorship of the Legion ol Honor. MaoMahon looked alter old soldiers, paid visits to illustrious friends, and Archbishop Albert among others, in Austria and Italy, and passed his sum mers and autumns at a small country house of his wife, la Foret, near Montar tris, where he died. Jiis .servants vene rated and loved him. The English thor oughbreds in his stable also knew him and craved to no stroked and patted by him. He was a keen sportsman and un erring shot to the end. The death illness was brought on by a drenching ho got when out shooting. Ho generally shot in the British style, and hated the conti nental "battue" whicli lie thought whole sale butchery, demanding no line quality on the sportsman's side, and not afford ing healthy oxereise.
