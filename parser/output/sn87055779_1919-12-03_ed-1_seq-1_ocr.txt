By AwIatM Pes: Springfield, in.. Dec. c Bi tuminous coal miners now on a nation-wide strike may have the sup port of tho miners in the eastern an thracite fields If they become "hard pressed," Frank Farrington, presi dent of the Illinois miners declared Tuesday. The miners have not yet utilized the full strength of their or ganization, he said, and pointed out that tho eastern section of the coun try now was receiving its normal supply of coal from the anthracite fields. Fnrringtrm's Statement, 'The United Mine Workers of America are not engaged in ruthless warfare against the public or the government," said Farrington. "They aro only determinedly contesting for a living wage. They have net as yet utilized the full strength of their or ganization as is evidenced by the fact that the strike order was not extended or made applicable to the anthraclto mine workers. Because of thla the eastern section of our country is now receiving tho normal supply of coal and there is a possibi lity that because of this those who aro handling the situation for the government from their snug and comfortable positions In the cast do not have a proper conception of the suffering that is imminent in the middle western and southwestern states and they no doubt feel there is ample time to experiment with aca demic theories in the settlement of the miners strike. Secure Aid, "In the past when tho anthracite mine workers were in trouble the bi tuminous miners have aided them when aid was needed and there is a likelihood that should the bitumin ous coal miners find themselves hard pressed in this case the anthracite mine workers may decide to come to their aid." The supply of coal for the city schools was exhausted Tuesday and announcement was made that the schools would be closed indefinitely. STOP LIQUOR SALE IN SOUTHERN CITY By Associated Presn: NEW ORLEANS. La. Dec. 2. Sale of liquor over the bar in New Orleans ended abruptly Tuesday with the issuance of an order by the United States circuit court of ap peals suspending a lower court in junction which restrained federal authorities from attempting to en force the war time prohibition act. The action of the appellate court did not surprise liquor dealers, many of whom closed their estab lishments Monday after the hearing on the government's petition to va cate the injunction. When the bars opened last Wednesday tho rush for liquors, wines and beer was o grrcat that the best grades soon were ex hausted and later complaints were made to the district attorney agains' high prices charged for inferior brands. "In view of the expected early and final decision of the supreme court of the United States upon the con stitutionality of the acts involved." said the court of appeals decision, "we think the orderly administra tion of justice requires tho mainten ance of the statute until the su preme court has acted. and this would mean continued enforcemen of the statute until declared uncon stitutional, if that should happen."
