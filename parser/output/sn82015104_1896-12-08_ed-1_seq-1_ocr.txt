WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The Presi dent to-day transmitted to Congress his last annual message, as follows: The Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their govern ment you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous conse quences, fraught with feverish appre hension and creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage, with out disturbance of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness in our na tional structure. When we consider these incidents and eont-mplate the peaceful obedience and manly submissi.m which have succeed ed a heated clash of political opinions, We dis< over abundant evidence of a dc i. rminatioa on the part of our country man to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dis position which entitle them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and inmfjTlah service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious ap preciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty hvirliw In obedience to a constitutional re quirement I hereby submit to the Con gress certain information concerning national affairs, with the suggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is in i liana 1J and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration, I shall omit many details concerning matters within Federal control which, by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental re port*, I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a minute recital jf many minor incidents con-I no t> d with our foreign relations which have heretofore found a place in Ex ecutive messages, but are now con tained In a report of the Secretary of State, which is herewith submitted. TURKISH OUTRAGES. The Shocking Features of the Situa tion Have Not Been flitigated. At the outset <>f a reference to the Tr-ire important matters affec ting our relations with foreign powers, it would afford me satisfaction if I could assure the Congress that the disturbed con dition in Asiatic Turkey had during the nasi year assumed a less hideous and M lOdy aspect, and that either as a Consequence of the awakening of the Turkish (e.vernment to the demands of humane c ivilization, or as the- result of a decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to it t- rfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of DM I bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the Shocking features of the situaticm had been ■Mitigated. Instead, however, of Welcoming ■ softened disposition or protective intervention, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfre quc*i:t reports of tb' wanton destruc tion of homes and the bloody butchery of men, women and children, made martyrs to the ir profession of Christian faith. AMERICAN CITIZENS STILE IN PER] L. While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the middle of dreadful ■cenes of danger, their safety in the future Is by no means assured. Our Government at home and our Minister at Constantinople have left nothing un done to protect our missionaries in Ot toman territory, who constitute nearly all the individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of American citizenship. our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed, but the deep feeling an< j s>mpathy that have been raised among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to P ad the th to de mand impossible things. The outbreaks of blind fury which lead to murder and pillage in Turkey occur sud denly and without notice, and an at tempt on our part to force such a hos tile- presence there as might be effective for pr< ye ntion or protection, would not only P.- resisted by the ottoman Govern ment, but would be regarded as an In terruption of their plans by the great nations who assert their exclusive light KO Intervene* In their own time and method for the security of life and prop- 1 erty in Turkey. Se-vrnl naval vessels are statione-d in tin- Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish ail possible relief and re fuge in cai i I emergency. CLAIMS WILL BE pressed. We have made claims against the j Turkish Government for the- pillage an i destruction of missionary property at ! Harpool and Marash during uprisings j at these places. Thus far the validity 1 THE RECORD-UNION. of these demands has not been admitted, though our Minister, prior to such out rages, and in anticipation of danger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned, and not withstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robbery. The facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement. ARMENIAN REFUGEES. A number of Armenian refugees hav ing arrived at our ports, an order has lately been obtained from the Turkish Government permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that hereafter no ob stacle w ill be interposed in prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turk ish dominions. HOPE FOR REFORMS. Our recently appointed Consul to Erzorum is at his post and discharging the duties of his office, though for some unaccountable reason his formal exe cmator from the Sultan has not been is sued. Ido not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christ endom. It so mars the humane and en lightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good people throughout the Christian world for its corrective treat ment will remain unanswered. 

CUBAN INSURRECTION. The Time Has Not Yet Arrived for This Government to Intervene. The insurrection in Cuba still con tinues with all its perplexities. It !s difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward tiie pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my [ last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the consider able towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the island country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesi tating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of num bers and character, and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their re- I solve not to succumb, without practi | caliy securing the great object for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the insur gents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent State. In deed, as the contest has gone on the pretense that civil government exists on the Island,, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practi cally abandoned. Spain does kc-ep on foot Kueh a Government, more or less perfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs. But, that excep tion being made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is sub ject to the military occupation of one jor the other party. THE END NOT IN SIGHT. It is reported, Indeed, on reliable authority, that at the demand of the Commander-in-Chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban Government has now given up all attempt to ex ercise its functions, leaving that Gov ernment confessedly (what there is the l'<-st reason for supposing it always to have been in fact) a Government me rely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open or in pitched battle, prompt and : decisive result might be looked for, and ! the immense superiority of the Spanish fore* s in numbers, disc ipline and equip tni at could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. I But they are called to face a foe that • shuns general engagements; that can choose, and does choose, its own ground; that from tie- nature of the country is visible or invisible at pleas ure, and that lights only ambush--!, and when the advantage of position and numl>ers are on its side. In a coun try where all that is Indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtainable, eapc « tally by those born and bred on the I »il. it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to the time during which hos tititles of tiiis sort may be prolong 1 A POLICY OF DESTRUCTION, j Meanwhile, in all case of protracted i civil strife, the passions of the com- I batants grow more and more Inflamed, an i. x. • sees on both sides become more I frequent and more deplorable. They are also participated in by bands of : mauranders, who BOW 'n the name of ac party and now in the name of the ther, as may Pest suit the occasion, harass the country at will and plunder its wretched Inhabitants for their own advantage. such a condition of things would inevitably detail Immense de» truction of property, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it r.s | far as practicable. Rut while such seemed to be th-- original policy of the ; Spanish Government, it has now ap p.w.-ntly abandoned it and is acting ! u|Hjn the same theory as the Insurgentr., namely, that the exigencies of the con test require the Wholesale annihilation • property, that it may not prove of i any OSe and advantage to the enemy. It is to the same end that in pursu l ance of general orders Spanish garri ! sons are now h ing withdrawn from plantations, and th" rural population ' required to concentrate itself in the j •.owns. The sure result would seem to ,be that the industrial value of the Island Is fast diminishing, and that uti | less there is a speedy and radical , hangs bo existing conditions it wl}] soon t disappear altogether. That value con sists very largely, of course, in its ca i a city t" t roduee sugar, a capacity al ; r ady very much reduced by the in t. rrupttoaa :<> tillage, which have taken place during the l ist two years. It 1? '■ reilaWy asserted that should these in : terruptions continue during the cur , rent year, and practically extend, as is ' now threatened, to the entire sugar j i reducing territory of the island, so 1 much time and so much money will be SACRAMENTO. TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1896.-EIGIIT PAGES. required to restore the land to its nor mal productiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt. THIS GOVERNMENT MUCH CON CERNED. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the whole globe, would engage the serious at tention of the Government and the peo ple of the United States in any cir cumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sentimental or phil anthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interests in it is second only to that of the people and Government of Spain. It is reasona bly estimated that at least from $30, --000,000 to $50,000,000 of American cap ital are invested in plantations and in railroad, mining- and other business enterprises on this island. The vol ume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in ISS9 amounted to about 164,000,000, rose in 1803 to about (103,000,000, and in 1894, the year be fore the present insurrection broke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Beside this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways both vex atious and costly. Many Cubans re side in this country and indirectly pro mote the insurrection through tbe press, by public meetings, by the pur chase and shipment of arms, by the taising of funds, and by other means, which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal pros ecutions, Some of them, thorough Cu bans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this Gov ernment, and not unnecessarily re garded with much indignation by the country of their origin. The insur gents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country always ana instinctively feel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which, in the case of the more adven turous and restless elements of our population leans in only too many in stances to ac tive and personal parti cipation in the contesr. The result is that this Government is constantly called upon to protect American citi zens, to claim damages for injuries to person and property, now estimated st many million of dollars, and to ask ex planations and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for the re pression of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the immunities belonging to the unoffending cftizen of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police a long line of sea coast against unlawful exp"ditions, the es cape of which the utmost vigilance will not always sufiiee to prevent. 

DEMANDS FOR INTERVENTION These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property in terest! affected, and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general, have led to a vehement demand in vs* : nous quarters for some sort of positive ' intervention on the part of the United st.-tp-s. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should be accorded the insur gents—a proposition no longer weighed, because untimely a nd in practical opera tion clearly perilous and injurious to our own inte rests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the in dependence of the insurgents should be recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish Government of the island may be, no other exists there—unless the will of the military officer in tempor ary command of a particular district can be dignifie d as a species of Gove-rnmont. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the Island—a sugges tion possibly worthy of consideration, if there were any evi.lence of a desire or willingn-ss on the part of Spain to en tertain sue h a proposal. A CHARACTER TO MAINTAIN. It is urged, finally, that all other methods failing, the existing Interne cine strife In Cuba should be terminated by our intervention even at the cost of a war between the United States and Spain, a war which its advocates con fidently prophesy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless a char acter to maintain as a nation, which Plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. NOT A NATION OF CONQUEST. Further, though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a neces sity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers, and de sires nothing so much as to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domains sat isfy all pnssihle longings for territory, precludes all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of covetous eyes up on neighboring regions, however attrac tive. That our conduct toward Spain and her dominions has constituted no ex ception to this national disposition, is made manifest by the course of our Gov ernment, not only thus far during the present Insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Vara in 1868. No other great power, it may Safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have mani fested the same restraint and the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persis tent attitude of the United States to wards Spain In connection with Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They in truth do not forget her conn, ( tion with the discovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish People, nor fail to fully recog nize their Splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor. Thoy view with wonder and ad miration the cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of men are sent across th. usands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt accumulated that the COStly possession of the gem of the An tilles may still hold its place in the Spanish crown, and yet neither the Gov ernment nor the people in the United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Cuba, or have failed to real ize the expense of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the authority of Spain—grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and by the Cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish statesmen, without regard to party, and demon strated by reforms proposed by the ex ecutive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish Government. WAY TO END THE 

STRIFE. It is in the assumed temper and dis position of the Spanish Government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications of influential public opinion in Spain, that this Government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife, with honor and advant age to Spain, and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of the in surrection. It would seem that if Spain would offer to Cuba genuine autonomy—a measure of home rule, which while pre serving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects—there should be no just reasons which the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would ap pear to be in the true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict, which is now consuming the resources of the island, and making it worthless for which ever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep in tact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be con sulted rather than Impugned by the ad equate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its inhabi tants within their own control with out severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under the most favorable conditions. 

WOULD PROMISES BE LIVED T'P TO? It has been objected on the one side that Spain would not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side that promised autonomy, however liberal, is insufficient, because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled. But the reasonableness of the requirements by Spain of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is conceded is not alto gether apparent. It ignores important features of the situation—the stability two years' duration has given to the insurrection; the feasibility of its in definite prolongation in the nature of things, as shown by past experience; the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily composed; above all the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all branches of her government and all her leading men concede to exist and pro fess a desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to with hold the proffer of needed reforms un til the parties demanding them put themselves at mercy £>y throwing "id own their arms has the appearance of neg lecting the gravest of p-rils and in inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant re forms. The objection on behalf of the insurgents—that promised reforms can not be relied upon—must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Neverthe less, realizing that suspicions and pre cautions on the part of the weaker of the two combatants are always nat ural and not always unjustifiable—be ing sincerely desirous in the interest of both, as well as on its own account, that the Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible delay it was intimated by this Government to the Government of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory meas ure of home rule tendered the Cu ban insurgents, and would be accepted by them upon a guarantee of its exe cution, the United States would en deavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this in timation has yet been received from the Spanish Government, it is believed to not altogeth.-r unwelcome, while as already suggested no reason is per ceived why it should not be approved by tho insurgents. Neither party can fail to see the importance of early ac tion and both must realize that to pro long the present state of things, for even a short period, w ill add enormous ly to the time and labor and expendi ture necessary to bring about the in dustrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for heal ing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and suc cessful Issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the man ner above outlined, or in any other way consistent with our Constitution and laws, will always be at the disposal of either party. MAY BE 

FORCED TO TAKE A HAND Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interest would con strain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference with its control by any other power. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due re spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all its features, and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it and its possible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and un precedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way, or with our friendly co-operation. When the inability of Spain to deal BttOC«CßfuTty with the insurgents has become manifest, and it is demon strated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug gle for its re-establishment has degen erated into a strife Which means noth ing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the con flict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereign ty of Spain will be superseded by high er obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. UPON CONDITIONS WILL DEPEND ACTION. Deferring the choice of ways and methods until the time for action ar rives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions then ex isting, and they should not be deter mined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor and interest, or the international J duty we owe to Spain. Until we face the contingencies suggested, or the sit uation is by other Incidents impera tively changed, we should continue in the line of conflict heretofore pursued, thus in all circumStaiu-ee exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty en joined upon us by the position we oc cupy in the family of nations,. A con templation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a care* less disregard of present duty, or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed ex pnasston of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to re mind Congress that a time may arrive when correct' policy and care for our in terests, as well as a regard for the in terests of other nations, and their cit izens, joined by considerations of hu manity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country intimately related to rs saved from complete devastation, will constrain our Government to such ac tion as will subserve the interests thus involved and atthesametimepromlse to Cuban and its inhabitants an oppor tunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. 

VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY. Has Ceased to be a Question Between This Country and Great Britain. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between (heat Britain and the United Statrs, their respective Governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Brftain and Venezuela, submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The I revisions of the treaty are so emi nently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated. GENERAL ARBITRATION. | Negotiations For a Treaty With Eng land Far Advanced. Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are far advanced, and promise to reach a successful conclusion at an early date. SEAL QUESTION. Action Taken to Preserve the Life of the Herds. We have during the last year labored faithfully and against unfavorable con ditions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Behring Sea. Both the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched Commissioners to these waters to study the habits and condition of the seal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of these Commissioners. .Soon to be submitted, and with the ex ercise of patk-nce and good sense on the part of all interested parties, it is ear nestly hoped that hearty co-operation may be secured for the protection against threatened extinction of seal life in the Northern Pacific and Behring Sea. TREASURY STATISTICS. Expenses Millions in Excess of the Revenues. The Secretary of the Treasury re j ports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1800, the receipts of the Gov ernment from all sources amounted to i *409,175,408 78. During the same pe j riod its expenditures were $484,678, --654 4S, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting to $25,203, --! 245 70. The ordinary expenditures i during the year were . r 4.015,552 21 less | than during the preceding fiscal year. |Of the receipts mentioned, there was [derived from customs the sum of $180, --021,ivi 67, and from internal revenue $1 16,830,615 (id. The receipts from cus toms show an increase of $7,863,134 22 over those from the same source for the fiscal year ending June :;o, 1805, and the receipts from internal revenue an increase of $3,584,537 01. IMPORTS .AND EXPORTS. The value of our imported dutiable merchandise during the last fiscal year was $369,757,770, and the value of free goods imported $409,967,470, being an increase of $6,523,675 in the value of free goods over the preceding year.

The number of barrels of beer produced was 35.809. --250, as against 33,589,784 produced in the preceding fiscal year, being an in crease of 2,200,140 barrels. PRECIOUS METALS. The total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was $112. --409,947 and of silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $45,041,400 of gold and $13,246,384 nf silver over the expecta tions of the preceding fiscal year. The imports of gold were $33,525,065, and of silver $25.777,1 5, ">. being $2,859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 more of silver than during the preceding year. The total stock of metallic money in the United States at the close of the last fiscal year ended on the 30th day of June. 1800. was $1,228,326,035, of which $599,597,964 was in gold and .*|>2N.72N,(>7l in silver. On the Ist day of November. 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,285,410,590, and the amount in circulation, not including that in the treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being 22.03 per capita upon an estimated population of 71, --l>t 12,000. The production of the precious metals in the United States during the calen dar year 1895 is estimated to have been 2.254.700 fine ounces of gold, of the value of $46,610,000, and 55.722, -000 fine ounces of silver, of the com mercial value of $36,445,600, and the coinage value of $72,051,000. The estimated production of these metals throughout the world during the same period was 9,488,821 fine ounces of gold, amounting to $200,285, --700 in value, and 169,189,294 fine ounces of silver, of the commercial val ue of $110,054,000. and of the coinage value of $218,738,100. according to our : ratio. The coinage of these metals in! the various countries of the world dur ing the same calendar year amounted to (232,701,43b in gold and $121,996, --218 in silver. The total coinage at the mints of the United Stat-s during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, amounted to $7L\ -ISS,4<5.\ 52, of which $58,878,490 was in gold coin and minor coins. NATIONAL HANKS The number of national banks organ ized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed up to Octo ber 31. 1896, was 5,051, and of this number 3,679 were at the date last mentioned in active operation, having authorized capital stock of $650,014, --895, held by 288,902 shareholders, and circulating notes amounting to $21* -412,620. The total outstanding circulating notis of all national banks on the 31st cay of October, 1886, amounted to $234,552,807, including unredeemed hut. fully secured notes of banks insolvi at and in process of liquidation. The in < rase in the national bank Circulation during the year ending on that day was $21,099,429. On October 0, 1896, when the condition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3679 active institutions was $3,263,685,313 83, which Included $1. --893,268,839 ."!l in loans and discounts, and $362,165,733 85 in money of all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities, $1 - 590,891,058 03 was due to individual depositors, and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding circulating notes. FOREIGN IfiniGRATION. Large Increase the Past Year Over the Preceding One. The number of immigrants who ar rived in the United States during tiie fiscal year was 343,267, of whom 340, --468 were permitted to land and 2,799 were debarred on various grounds pre scribed by law and returned to the countries whence they came at the ex pense of the steamship company by which they wore brought in. The in crease in immigration over the pre ceding year amounted to 84,131. It is reported that with some excep tions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring class, accus tomed and able to earn a support for themselves, and it is estimated that the money brought with them amounted to at least $5,000,000, though it w as prob ably much in excess of that sum. since only those having less than i?.*i<> are re quired to disclose the exact amount, and it is known that many brought c onsiderable sums of money to buy land and build homes. Including all the immigrants arriv ing who w ere over 14 years of age, 28.63 per cent, were illiterate, as against L' 0.37 per cent, of these of that age ar riving during the preceding fiscal year. The number of immigrants over 11 years old, the countries from which they came and the percentage of illit erates among them were as follows: Italy, 57,515. with 54.59 per cent.; Ire land. .'i7. IOC, with 7 per cent.; Russia, 35,188, with 41.14 per cent.; Austria- Hungary and provinces, 57,053, with 38.92 per cent.; Germany, 25,334, with 2.98 per cent.; Sweden, 18,821, with I.lb per cent.: while from Portugal there came 2,067, of whom 77.09 per cent were illiterate. There arrived from Japan during the year only 1,110 immigrants, and it is the opinion of the immigration author ities that the apprehension heretofore existing to some extent of a large im migration from Japan to the United States is without any substantial foun dation. WAR DEPARTMENT. Satisfactory Conditions in the Sev eral Branches of the Service. The report of the Secretary of War exhibits satisfactory conditions in the several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge. The limit of our military force as fixed by taw is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morale of our army are excellent, and marked progress and efficiency are ap parent throughout its entire organiza tion. With the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight In dian disturbances along our south western boundary, in which the Mexi can troops co-operated, and the com pulsory but peaceful return, with the consent of Great Britain, of a band of One Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active op-ra tions have been required of the army during the year past. Changes in methods of administra tion, the abondonment of unnecessary posts and consequent concentration of troops and the exercise of care and vigilance by the various officers charged with the responsibility in the expenditure of the appropriations, have resulted in reducing to a minimum the cost of maintenance of our military es tablishment. The entire army has now beer, equipped with the new magazine arms and wise policy demands that all avail able public and private resources should be so employed as to provide within reasonable time a sufficient number to supply the State milkia with these modern weapons and provide an ample reserve for any emergency.
