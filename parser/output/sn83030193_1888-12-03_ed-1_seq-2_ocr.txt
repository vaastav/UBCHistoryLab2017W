Nature's a woman and hkea a good cry and this rain should make her feel better. Wo are de veloping in stylo of late years. Tho old Mothor Gamp umbrella is not quito so numerous as it used to be and tho "street sales " are falling off. Tho gentle maiden does not now caro about being seen with the dingy alpaca sho wan content with a few years ago, and sho must havo a handlo to hor umbrella that is worth showing. Hut fashion has a hard ficht to knock shape into a water proof. You do see the attempt to shape the waterproof to the figuro, but unfortunately tho bustle stioks out and little pools aro liable to form there and, w oil. the balloon lias pot to be popular yet awhile. Tho waterproof makes all women equal, and the seamstress may lie a millionaire milliner for aught you know, tho servant may bo the mistress, the bello of tho Western Addition may be a simple dndcen. It is different with men somehow. You can't make any mistako about a man because be is in a raincoat Ho'llgivo himself away with his feet if you cover ills head up, and with his hoad if you co er his feet up. It is pretty hard to iudgo a woman nowadays if you don't see her bonnot or her dress. A cortain taste is born in California women that enables them to carry themselves gracefully any. where. The California man is equally un. mistokabloi but it is not tho same kind of taste exactly. Givo a man all tho mouey in the world end he will nevor bo able to hide his real quality and tho original elements in him. Give a woman money and lot her alone and in two weoks sho will not bo discernible from those who havo had money ail tboir lives. Sho will surround herself with the daintiest thiucs ; she will piok up in no timo tbe ' savolr faire " that a man in liko rir. cumstauces will nevor attain at all: she will develop an amount of tasto that will astonish all her male relatives; she will get sixtoen times more real enjoyment out of life than her husband, if sho has one.

Ono of tho amateur politicians of the G.O.P.'s County Committee, which proposes to discipline the leaders of tho Eighth Assembly District machine, thought ho had hit upon a very clcvor scheme, for reorganizing tho district, with O'Brien. Ilourke, Brodsky and tho rost out, when ho proposed to starve them out. Ho would create now leaders, endow them with Federal ofllccs, and with tho assistance of tho United States Treasury knock out all the pretensions of O'Brien to leadership. How effectual this remedy would bo in healing tho Eighth District ulcer on tho body of tho lto publican organization may bo inferred when it Is known that of all tho election district llcpub. llcan leaders under O'Brien not ono is an office holder. John J. O'Brien says that this Is a very dovcr idea, but Alderman-elect Oootz and other of O'Brien's followers say that tho brain which conceived it was too small to consider at tho same timo that Mr. O'Brien has a right to expect something from Gen. Harrison for his sorvicos in behalf of the National ticket. Col. JoclB. Erhardt and John W. Jacobnsaro tbo two ltepubllcans prominently named to suc ceed Hans ti. Bcattlo as Uurveyor of the Port of Now York. Both these , gentlemen oomplaln that tho O'Brien machlno slaughtered them in the Eighth District, and the reformers hope to see one of them Hnrveyor, for then they will bo assured that not a Hinulo O'Brienito will receive a Cus-tom-Uonse appointment. O'Brien, his friends say, is not afraid that ho will not not his share of publio patronage for his friends. If tho amateur purist politicians are against him, ho is assured of the friendship and recognition of practical politicians like Tom Piatt and Matt Quay, and both those bid fair to have a great deal to say regarding tho distribution of offices. They value Johnny, his methods and inflnenco too much to lose him by tho withholding of a fow minor offices. With, John Wannamaker for Postmaster General and Tom Piatt in tho Treasury Depart ment, Johnny's friends would not lack for placo. Humors have been current for a few days that the Police Commissioners had a secret meeting and removed O'Brien from his pros, ent office. Of course. It was a canard. O'Brien now holds over, and has dono so for a year, because of o deadlock in tho Police Board. Whon tho original civil service list was sent up L. 8. Mott, a veteran, led the list and Edward Qilon, a County Democrat, was next in rank. Johnny went into Court and had his namo put on tho list. A voto for a now Chief of the Bureau of Elections showed that Commissioners French and McOlava were for Mott, and Voorhls aud Porter for Oilon. and thero the matter reatad. Tho- Commissioners cannot romove O'Brien, as, under the law, he holds over until his successor is appointed and qualified. Undor tho present organization of the Board, there is no liklihood of a now Cniof being se lected. Tho next hoad of the Bureau will draw only $1,000 a year, tho Commissioners having fixed the salary, after the present Chief retires, at that sum; but Johnny O'Brien, as a hold-over, receives $5,000 a year for less than six weeks of actual service. The term of office of President French ox plres in May, and Mayor Grant will have the power to namo his successor. As French and O'Brien rendered valuable assistance in the election of Mr. Grant, it is conceded that Mr. French will Buccoed himself, without being pledged to appoint a new Chief. Mr. McOlave will Bervo until May, 1801, and many peoplo think that a Tammany Hall Democrat will be his successor, unless the non-partisan custom prevails, and he, too is reappointed. Should this, rule be ob served. O'Brien will continue in business at the old stand during the Presidential eleotion of 1892, as heretofore. An Old Slaveholder Experience. 7Vfiei0la Jftui, WmaMnaton Ltttv. Lot the lady on my left, who works in the Patent Offloo, tell a little lifo story i " There came into our department a few weoks ago, " said she, " a tall, gaunt man from Southern Virginia. He once owned a plantation and many slaves. The war impoverished him. He didn't know how to work, had Dover lifted his hand, and concluded he was too old a bird to learn new tricks. So he drifted along, barely keeping body and soul together, just as many of the old aristocracy in that section havo dono evor since the war. Fi nally his Congressman secured him a plaoe bere. and induced him to accept it on the representation that there was not muoh to do but draw his salary. The placo was uoh a one as is usually held by a colored man a janitor, in fact and bis duties were the mak ing of fires, sweeping and keeping things in order. You ought to havo seen the look of disgust on that man' face whon ho found what tho work was. " Why, Bah,' said ho, I never made a fire n my lite, I nover swept a flo I never earned how to work, sab." " And I saw the bitterness coming into his face, heard it in his tone. He was about to throw up tbo job. Then one of our type writer operators, a young woman from New England, spoke up. Thore was a kindly look in her eye, a mellow sympathy in her voice. But she cut straight to the core ot the matter. " Look here,1 she exclaimed, ' let me toll you something. I say it for your own good. Yon ought to know that the world has gone past you. We,' and sho pointed to tno busy olerks in the room, ' don't brag of what we can't do, but of.wliat we can do.' " Well, that was a centre shot. It roused the man. He stood silent as if he were living all hi lifo over again. Then he npnroaohea the grate as if to make the fire. But he didn't know now to go at it, and was about to turn away in despair when tho yonng woman from New England stepped forward. ' ' ' Let me show you,' she said ; ' it is 80 easy when yon know how.' "Tho upshot of It oil? Yhy. the tall, gaunt Virginian has become one of the best janitors in onr building. And the strangest thing about it is that he likes the work. He says he has wasted twenty-five years of his lifo ; that he is now a man again. " "And is he worried about tho election? Does he fear for his placo ?" " No. He half hopes he will lose the job and have to seek employment elsewhere. you see, an tno dormant, rusty energy of tbe man has been awakened, and In his new life and ambition he feels equal to any. thing."
