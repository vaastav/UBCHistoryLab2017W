TUESDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1861. tSfTlic Senate, yesterday, gave a pretty free scope to its discussion on the policy— or rather lack of policy—that governed our campaign, and some of the Senators were quite pointed in their criticism of the “ lukewarmness in high places. ” IST* A war vessel and a gunboat have been dispatched hastily across the Atlantic Jo watch for the rebel steamer Nashville, now in the port of Southampton, and to seize her upon her leaving the protection of British waters. If the Nashville shall not have escaped already, this will proba bly ensure her capture; but it will make Jvhn Bull turn up his nose. prose kkufout. Senator Wilson in the Senate yesterday pronounced.the campaign in South Caroli na the most disgraceful of the war thus far. Read the brief summary of corres pondence from Beaufort, in another col umn. to wonder at a policy in a Govern ment or its Generals that can produce inch results. When laborers by thousands are ready and willing to his hands, Gen eral T. W. Sherman wears out his own soldiers in heavy and protracted toil, and turns the slaves of rebel masters away. ISolhing done, or next to that, since Du pont put Sherman ashore. It really seems as if the latter's highest ambition lay in the direction of keeping himself in as good order as possible with the ‘-proud and hospitable people,’’ for future tea parties and junketings with first families of South Carolina. He certainly has done little to forfeit their displeasure. SECRETARY CHASE’S REPORT. In another column, we give among our dispatches n fill] abstract of the Report of the Secretary of the Treasury. It is for tunate for the Government, and the people, that the clear headed sagacity and sterling integrity of Salmon P. Chase are brought to bear upon, and into control of, the na tional finances at this time. To refer to main features here would be nearly to reproduce the close abstract elsewhere given, which will merit careful reading, and create a desire to see the original, whose merits it foreshadows. It is a pro found and statesman-like discussion of graver questions and aspects of Finance than have ever in our history been laid before the nation. Secretary Chase's logic has the irresistible power of figures. He shows the people that at our present rate of expenditure we are rolling up u war debt (»f 

EIGHT HVNDRED MILLIONS, Sup posing us to be well over the war in 1803. It is well for the people to have their ac count with themselves and the world sent ;n just at this lime, for it will inevitably elicit (he wholesome query whether we are getting the worth of our money V "Whether we are making progress in any other di rection Ilian in gelling into debt 'i Mr. Chase gives an interesting history of his admirable management, successful through the no less admirable spirit of pat riotism of the bankers to whom his appeal was made, whereby the immediate exlgcn eierana war disbursements were provided for from the first, leaving time for the loan to be taken among the people. Looking our difficulties fully m the face, and hold ing the public* ledger up to the people, the Secretary shows a revenue fallen off, incident to a time of war, and then pru dently and plainly recommends, first re trenchment* u slopping of all leaks, an end to the dishonest gains of contractors. The modes proposed to meet the defi ciency of revenue, include the direct taxa tion of stills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank notes, carriages, legacies, on paper, eviden ces of debt, and conveyances of property, and other like property. By this means the burden will fall upon shoulders the ]*est able among community to bear the same, the wealthy and consumers of luxu ries. True to his principles as a hater of human chaitelism, Mr. Chase, in touching upon the slavery question, advises the con fiscation of rebel property as a means of making them pay their for cyl»s they have brought us ; but this is not the policy*' of making the Govern ment a slaveholder, which he deems an im possibility, for as to the slaves of rebels their mimumissiou is recommended. We shall refer to this admirable repon more at length, when wG £h>dl be able to lay it be fore our readers in fall. We MmrtHelp East Tcdikswc< fiver since the Southern rebellion was inau gurated, East Tennessee haajslood out, single -landed and alone, in defense of the Union and in defiance of the Richmond or Nashville conspirators. The brave men of the moun tains, who owned such leaders a? Andrew John-on, Browulow, Maynard. 2nd their asso ciates, sturdily refused to follow in the too pr- valent fashion of rebellion, and they turned t*- ; that Government for which they had risked -f not sac rificed all for some token of its sym pathy and approval. And we shame to sav they have looked almost in vain. Two or tlir.-e thousand men, who fled to Kentucky h»r a rendezvous, were most tardily supplied ■v'ith arms, and only received their clothing " hen those they had worn from home were worn oven to a degree of nakedness. Not a musket, that wc know of, was ever seat to East Tennessee. Perhaps it was because they Acrid be robbed of them if sent; perhaps ’-c -lusc there was no means of sending: hut however that may be, It seems to us. and in deed the country expected, that arms should have been scut, borne by loyal men who could not have been despoiled of them. The East Tennesseeans, left unprotected, were visited by Zollicoflcr’s army and “subjugated;" then another commander followed him. when he had advanced into Kentucky, and only last month this second individual announced by proclamation that “quiet reigned in Warsaw." Since then, however, Brownlow’s 3,000 men, armed with the rudest implements of war, hive met and defeated the rebels; they have, burned bridges and cut off telegraphic •••■mmunication; audthey only need the assis- oi a few Northern brigades to hold this c-.-nirc of the Confederacy, cutting - olf all in jnlereourse between the East and ‘Western portions. No wonder the East Tennessee * roups in Kentucky rebelled at Gen. Thomas's order to Call back, and were only appeased by being allowed to remain in their advanced po hit ion near London, on the high road to Cum berland Gap. There, however, they are con stantly kept awake by tbe roar of the conflict going on about their very homes, and can •Lordly be restrained from dashing ahead to join in the fray- An East Tennesseean writes trom Camp Calvert, near London, under date of the 2d: We receive intelligence from Tennessee every <’ov. Brownlow is part of his time In Blount and I_ah in Sevier county. If we v.ould but cross tbe mountains, there v m;ld be a perfect uprising of the people, and a central engagement, with weapons from a steam boat cylinder, used as a cannon, down to rocks and W What ate you going to do for us.

I would not be as tonished if time developed the fact that some *;se ' •-6b*' are high in authority in gome place besides the Southern Confederacy. In commenting upon this the Cinnlnuali CVtnmwfcd says: The insurrection in East Tennessee was not an accident. "Weknow the Union men were in the most solemn manner assured that if they would make a dcmcr.Htratlon they should be Instantly Mipporlcd In force. Gen. Sherman pledged hiui self to that effect.

Must we endure that, too t Gen. Hunter’s Platte County Policy. A committee of the citizens of Platte county visited General Hunter on Monday, the 2d. The General said to them: “ Tell 'the Trus tees of Platte county, that unless they give up Gordon and Ids gang, and break up even* rebel camp, that 1 shall send CWojicZ Jhuiison over therewith orders to bum every house in Viscounty. Jam Qitting tired of Vie whole subf'et." Committee —“ ‘Will you put that in writin" - ?” Gen. Hunter — U I will.” 3 That brief interview satisfied Platte county, and the policy indicated will satisfy Kansas and the country. Murder at Joliet, HI. The Joliet (I1L) True Democrat says that on Friday evening last, the 6th inst., as’Benjamin Pickell was leaving his blacksmith shop, near the railroad depot, for home, he was shot dead, and the murderer, who had approached stealth ily through the alley, at once fled. A German named Taff, brother-in-law of Pickell, and be tween whom there had been some contention, lias been arrested, and circumstances point to him as the guilty party. Pickell leaves a wife and quite a large family. SP Col. Sinclair’s regiment, at Ypsilanti, Mich., (the 14th State volunteers,) is receiving its finishing touches, preparatory to taking the field. It will probably be ready by the 20th inst. Its field ofiicers have now been made up as follows ; Colonel, Robert P. Sin clair; Lieutenant Colonel, R. W. Davis, of Pontiac, late Collector of the port of Detroit; Major, M. W. Quaekeubush, of Owosso; Quartermaster, Hon. Wm. it. Terry, Jr., of Grand Haven; Acting Adjutant, A. E. Magill, son of Rev. Dr. Magill, of Rock Island, HI. SF'Four hundred and sixty-four Federal prisoucrsdiaTe been sent to New Orleans, of whom one is a commissioned officer. The others arc divided by States, us follows: 18 non-commissioned officers and 90 privates from New York; G uon-coimmssionedjofficcrs and 42 privates from Maine; two non-commis sioned officers and 12 privates from New Hampshire; three privates from Rhode Island; one private from Vermont; six non-commis sioued officers and 33 privates from Massachu setts; two.non-commissioned officers and 20 privates from Connecticut, etc. ST A quantity of United States Commis sary stores, consisting of twenty-one tierces of bacon, and several more of other smoked and salt meats, were seized at New York, last Friday, by the United States Marshal, on sus picion that they had been stolen from the Government. Most of the original marks on the packages were erased, but enough remain ed to show that they had oucelbelongcdto the Government. The broker, in whose hands they were found, claims that they had been consigned to his clerk, by order of a high offi cial in the army at Washington, to be exchang ed for rye flour. 55?* Major McNctt, of Colonel Green's regi ment. raising at Courlland, N. Y., was shot by his commanding oflicer, last Friday, in an attempt to escape from the guard house. He had just been arrested upon his return from Albany, where he had been to prefer charges against Col. Green. His wound was mortal. ESP The appointment of Gen. Thomas L. Price of Missouri to the command originally assigned him by Fremont, will give great sat isfaction to the country, who have only known of Gcu. P. to admire him. He is a brother of the rebel General Sterling Price, and lias still another brother, with a whole host ofrelativcs in the rcbelscrvice. Almost alone of his family, lie stands unshaken for the Union, and he has done good service as commander of the troops centered at Jefferson City. When it was feared that the Administration would fail to continue him in the service, he bade farewell to his troops (to whom he is again happily restored,) and in an address to the people of Missouri he said: To the citizen!-of this State, many of whom I have known and been on the most friendly terms with for a great many years, and whose interest is identified with my own. I would say a word. 1 exhort them to use even* endeavor to suppress and allay all causes and acts of party strife, which tend to disturb* the harmony or welfare of any well founded community, especially in a socictv and government formed as oars was previous to this mutual struggle, brought upon ub hy the dis appointment of dangerous and designing meu of power.

The telegraph has already advised us of the claim made by a Missouri secessionist, named ■\Vheclan, for immunity in his person and in the possession of his slaves, made the plea that he is a “ British subject." His slaves, eleven in number, hare been brought to Rolla. and th£ Cftsfi axraits diplomatic or judicial decision. Mr. Wilkins, the Consul at §t. Louis, (late of this city,) is already matter. The Rolla correspondent of the Bern ocrat tolls of the skives and their capture as follows: «,n“ e fc ’“ Ce - S - N - Of tllJ "S 1 the Current river, towards the Arkansas border, with 190 men. in purstmof Tom Freeman, ami -orae five hundred rebels. On his return, near the Southern boundary of Dent county, he found a lot of negroes en route for Arkansas and Mississippi. One oT the number was a yellow boy. This lad had on his wrists two pair of handcuffs and two trace chains, and he wa<» chained to the corner of a log cabin in such a po sition that he could neither sit down nor stand ap his wrists were mnch swollen. Captain Wood pro cured an are. and with his own hands severed the chain, declaring at the same time, that "no tc/iite man would treat a dog in that wav." As the command had halted for snppcr. pickets were pushed ont. and brought in several men ser vants. oi route for Freeman’s camp, then onlv sis miles off.

He was not here to enforce the ••local laws of Missouri for the benefit of rebels, ••but to put down treason.*’’ The result ended in the slaves all coming to RoHa. JSjT - Governor Yates, of Illinois, after a protracted and serious illness, is now, we arc glad to learn, convalescent and in a fair way to complete restoration to- health. The in juries received by the kick of his horse - , at the great review of Camp Bailor troops some weeks since, were painfully complicated by erysipelas setting in upon the injured leg, and this for a time threatened serious conse quences. Gov. Yates has been of inestimable sendee to the interests of the State In the past year, and we hope he may soon resume those executive duties which there are few persons who could till so well. X3T A few nights since Michael Gorman, a watchman on the Milwaukee & Prairie du Cliicn railroad, below' Muscoda station, while guarding the track from obstructions which sonic evil disposed persons were in the habit of placing thereon, was brutally assaulted and dangerously wounded on the head with a slung shot or club, as Is supposed, from the effects of which he died on Thursday at four o'clock. A desperate fight took place in Wirt county, Virginia, a few days since, between a detachment of the Eleventh Virginia Regi ment and a superior force of the Moccasin Rangers, a rebel organization. The latter were beaten, with a loss of eight or tea. Among the killed is Pet. Connoly, who boasted of having thirty Union scalps in his possession. James O. Wilkcrson, the murderer of the Macc family, (a most unprotoked and hor rid murder), has escaped from jail in Carroll ton, Green county, DL, and a handsome re ward is offered for his arrest. FROM BEAUFORT, The New York Tribune's correspondence from Beaufort is to Dec. 3d, and what has been done since Dupont gave over the work to Sherman and his land force is summed up as follows: Rcconnoissanccs of all the islands this side of Port Royal Harbor, and of the mnin i fln a from Savannah River up to Beaufort have been carefully made. The damages to the captured iorts have been repaired, and both put in perfect condition for defense against any possible attack. Hilton Head Bland, about twelve miles by seven, is wholly in military occupation, strong pickets, occupy ing all important points, and Braddock’s Point, at its extreme end, where guns were pointed to prevent the landing of our troops, is permanently held. Intrenehments strengthen the positions and encampments of the whole of our force, not com* pletcd, but already extensive. Immense quantities of stores of every description have been landed from the transports, in the most difficult circumstances, within adequate means and only by incredible labor. Not less Vian 1,500 soldiers have been working day and night , much of the time in Vie water, and without any but the simplest help for lifting and transporting heavyweights. Everything has been brought on shore in small boats, the beach shelving gradually, and, until the wharf is finished, no launches or lighters being able to approach within a considerable distance. The wharf is well advanced in construction, built of huge pine logs, cut three or four miles away, partly dragged and partly floated down to the beach. A great quantity of lum ber for other purposes has been got in the same way. That of which the storehouses were built was brought in the transports. Of the storehouses, two arc 250 by 30 feet each, two others each 125 feet by the same width The stable Is 600 feet long and 23fcetwide, and about as much more is to be added. The heavy labor imposed upou the soldiers bv the refusal of the War Department to furnish laborers, and the large force required for the pickets, has interfered to some extent with drill and the regular routine of camp life, yet a great deal has been done to improve the soldierly condition of the division. Five to eight hours a day I am assured has been regu larly devoted to drill, battalion and brigade movements, and other instruction for theexi gendes of special service. The picket dutv may lie divided into two classcs—the that which is immediately about the brigades’ the outlying, much heavier and harder, all over the Island, holding roads and ferries and other important points. Add to this summary* the expeditions in all directions, naval and military, the occupation of Tvbee Island at Savannah and the possession‘of St. Helena Sound to the north, 25 miles nearer Charles ton than this harbor, both having fortifica tions which have been abandoned by the rebels, and I believe some general notion may be formed of the work accomplished up to the present date. The condition of the troops here, their health and spirits, I cannot say much about. The sick lists have been largely increased by the character of the work the Men have had to perform, mveh of which might have been done by contra bands, if the General commanding hail chosen to avail himself of their services to a greater ex tent. Some of the regiments arc much better off than others; and it Is plain that their con dition when leaving home has very much to do with their present state. The best armed and officered regiment here has had perhaps the very hardest work to do, and still lias not suffered so much as others. The tone of feel ing remains as it was, and carries them through everything. One first result of the fall of the forts was the universal alarm that spread along the coast Itom Charleston to Savannah, and liowmuch further I know not. Extra trains were ad vertised to leave Savannah the dav after the -surrender, to convey the inhabitants to places of more safety. There were probably not 3.500 troops in all South Carolina, and Gen. Sherman might have marched a couple of regi ments to the railroad, broken up the eomnui nieatiou between the two cities, scattered the remnants of the fugitives from the forts, and for all that appears, have taken Savannah with little or no opposition. The precipitate flight from the forts is accounted for from the fact that when they once became convinced it could not be held, they knew their retreat mi"-Ut have been wholly cut off by one or two gun boats in Skull Creek. Many facts in our pos session now, if known then, would have ena bled us to make the immediate fruits of the victory* much more complete; and some of them, it Is not tShfafr to sav, ought to have been known and acted on. The opinion pre vails extensively among officers and meu, that our advantages were not followed np as they ought to have been atthc moment. The comrabaiid question is not less interest ing in its features than important in its rela tion to the expedition and the whole war. Facts are so numerous that the difficulty isto select from the mass of materials those which are most important. I can only repeat, to day, a few of the statements, which come to me from the best authority, observing in the first place that there are hot more than three hundred in camp at present. Their feeling of hostility to their late masters and gratitude to us is unmistakable and universal, and their readiness to work is shown in even* way. The policy of Gen. Sherman, or whoever is respon sible for Ids remarkable proclamation, I can not pretend to fathom, nor am laUe to see xchy their services should not relieve the overworked sol diers from some of the heaviest tasks imposed upon them. The slaves come slowlv into camp lor several reasons. The invitation held out is of the coldest—the accommodations, when h\ are wretchedly insufficient—they cannot bring their families in anv number—tHoy can not return for them If Ihey arc left behind— their condition on the descried plantations is one of case and comfort, and every obstacleto the camp is thrown in their wav.* That thev have been shot in numbers by'overseers and masters is beyond all question. natters InUUuonri. St. Louis, Dec. 9.—A person, direct from Bates comity, passed through Jefferson Citv on the 7th, for Rolla, and reports that when near Clinton, he saw a good many wagons loaded with stores for Price’s armv. Thev were from the river counties. He stales there was every evidence that the insurgents would recuperate a force south of the Osage, equal at least to anv heretofore raised in the State.

There has been a discussion in the Senate, to-day, concerning military disasters, on a resolution for a committee to inquire into the general conduct of our campaign, offered by Mr. Fessenden. The debate was participated in by himself, Grimes, Wilson, Sherman and others. It was uncommonly earnest and in teresting. Mr. Sherman contrasted the self sacrificing energy of the country with the supineness and lukewarmness in Government quarters here. Mr. Wilson referred to the glaring contradictious in the proclamations of Generals commanding different corps of the army, and the lack of a common system or policy. He thought the campaign in South Carolina the worst chapter of the war. All agreed that there had been blundering some where. The majority in the House for Mr. Lovejoy’s motion was smaller than it would have been had another made It. will shortly introduce a bill reorganizing the Supreme Court, on the basis of population. The New England States, New York, and Pennsylvania, embracing ten millions, will remain as now, with three judges, viz: Clifford, Nelson, and Grier. The Southern States, excepting Kentucky and Missouri, will be assigned three Judges, viz: Taney, Wayne, and Catron. The Western States, including Missouri, and embracing ten and a half millions, will have throe new Judges. Kentucky and Ohio will be one Cir cuit; Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and South ern Wisconsin another Circuit; and Minneso ta, lowa, Missouri, and Kansas another. The Pacific States will remain as before, under an independent Circuit Judge. Secretary Chase said, in response to a toast at a dinner given by the Union Club of New York, that the blackest negro in South Caro lina, though black as midnight, in his eves is whiter than the whitest rebel. He was ve hemently cheered bj* the company, among whom was Wm. B.

The gist of the char ges against him arc, rude and offensive ian guago and conduct towards Dr. Triplcr, the Medical Director of the army of the Potomac. It is understood that the difficulyjhas been one of long standing, and it is a thorough disagree ment between two doctors.

A force of cavalry moved from Winchester toward Harper’s Feny, yesterday, apparently engaged in scouting and foraging. Wm. Heine, the artist of the'’Japan Expe dition, was to-day mustered into the service as an aid to Gen. Heintzelman, with the rank of Captain. Col. Kerrigan’s trial for conduct prejudicial to good order in the army, was commenced to day. The specifications comprise neglect to instruct his soldiers, allowing them to indulge in disputes and brawls; allowing his parade grounds to be filthy; absenting himself from duty, and drunkenness one the march. He looks thin and haggard. 

FROM CAIRO. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, December 9th. 1801. The two new gnu boats, Benton and Essex, that left St. Louis a few days since, grounded about twenty miles above Cape Girardeau. A force of over three hundred men and some steamers have been sent to their relief. They will probably be afloat to-morrow. A force of about two hundred men left here this morning on board the steamer Chancellor, for some point above, in Kentucky. On Saturday Capt. McFarland, a merchant living at Elizabethtown, Hardin County, HL, intercepted a Kentuckian, who was attempt* ing to smuggle a huge quantity of goods South. The smuggler, with his contrabands and staff, was captured and brought to this place on the steamer Courier. The goods consisted of 450 ounces of quinine, and boxes containing a variety of articles, weighing 1,500 pounds. The Columbus Confederate 2facs states that there arc five new gun boats there awaiting an attack from the Lincoln fleet. Gen. Polk is recovering from the injuries received by the bursting of a big gun a short time since. G. W.

THE PRIVATEER NASHVILLE, Q Preparations to Capture Her-*-Writs Sent to England. New York, Dec. 9.— The Secretary of the Navy has dispatched one of the fastest and most powerful vessels in the navy, and a swift gun boat - , to intercept the rebel steamer Nash ville on her return. The instructions of the officers arc to ap proach the British coast as near as the neu trality laws will permit, and to cruise off the coast until they capture the steamer. The Nashville is likely armed, and If the United States steamcis fall in with her she will cer tainly be taken. A writ of attachment on the part of the loyal owners of the Nashville nas also gone out in one of the steamers to be executed In Southampton. Orders b j Gen. Halleck. Bx. Louis, Dec. A— Gen.

Washington, Decembers, 1861- SENATE. A number of petitions were presented and referred to the appropriate committees. Sev eral on the emancipation of.the slaves of reb els were presented and referred to the Com mittee on the Judiciary. Mr. SUMNER of Mass, presented a reso lution that all memorials and papers on the files of the Senate relating to the recognition of Liberia and Hayti be taken from the files and referred to the Committee on Foreign Af faire; Agreed to. Mr. CLARK of N. H. offered a resolution requesting the Marshal of the District to in form the Senate by what authority he keeps slaves of the District in jail, merely because they are refractory. He said he had visited the jail and found a number of slaves of the District, confined "for no reason only because their masters or mistresses them there because they were re fractory. The resolution was agreed to. .Hr- HALES resolution, directing the Judi ciary Committee to inquire into the expedien- the present Supreme Court, and to establish another, was taken up. He said the present Supreme Court had foiled. He believed if the rebels nowin arms should succeed, the Supreme Court would decide that the soldiers now in Virginia were trespassers and rioters. Mr. 

COLLAMEB of Vermont moved as a substitute, that all portions of the President’s Message relating to the Judiciary be referred to the Judiciary Committed. Mr. Collamer’s amendment was agreed to, and the resolution as amended was adopted. On motion of Mr. CHANEEtEB ofMTchigm, the resolution inquiring thcT-cause of the ois asters to our army at Bull Run and Ball’s Bluff, was taken up. * The question was on the substitute offered by Mr. Grimes, that a selectcommittee be ap pointed to investigate the -cause of all the to asters that have happened to the Union forces. Mr. 

CHANDLER said -that affairs of the army were not, indeed, liableto impeachment, but one of our own number has fallen (Baker) and “nobody is to blame.”. Bib thought the facts ought to be known. ; He wanted the truth known regarding disasters in Missouri, referred to by the Senator (Lane) from Kansas. If 6cn. Fremont is to blame, let it be known; but if not, in God’s name, let Mm be justified, and let the countiy know it ’ Mr. FOSTER of Ct. thought it best not to investigate the subject now~ under the pres ent circumstances. He thought Congress had better not do it. If militaty officers managed the army badly. Congress Would only make a bad matter worse by Interfering. He would let the military alone in time of war. An in quiry of this kind would, besides, onlvcall men away from higher duties. At the proper time Congress might nuke the inquiry. , SHERSIAN of Ohio* believed an inves tigation would be beneficial, especially a gen eral inquiry into the whbjc conduct of the war, and said he would record his solemn con viction that before the war ceased, slavery would almost, if not entirely, cease to exist”; but the war should be carried on without anv reference to the subject of slavery, to preserve a tree country for free men* 1 If we would in fuse the spirit of the people into all the de partments of the Governn\snt, the war would soon end. f Mr. WILSON of Mass, was glad the Presi dent would take a wide field. He thought it was time the “Proclamations*’ of officers should cease and the Government have the sole settled policy. We must remember we had not the men of large Jtailltary experience. Great mistakes had been nrfwie and were like ly to be made, but he wanted it understood that the jwpfr expected no mistake would be made, but that every man would give all he has and is to the country. Mr. LATHAM of Cal. asked for the veas and nays, and the resolution was agreed to, yeas £O, nave 3. The nays* were Messrs. Chrlile, Latham, and Pice; the absentees were r ßright, Collamer, Foot, Thompson. Wilson. Adjourned. * HOUSE OF KEPKESENTATIVES.

' Mr. RICHARDSON, on Military Affairs-, fuHoVlng, which was passed: iiekeas. The exchange of prisoners in the present rebellion has already been practiced indi rectly. and as such exchange would not only in crease enlistments and add to the onr army, bin subserve the highest interests of hu manity. and as such exchange does not involve recognition of the rebels as a Government; there fore. Jlesdted. By the Senate and Douse of Represent atives. that the President of the United States he requesiedto inaugurate systematic measures for the exchange of prisoners iu the present rebellion. On motion, it was resolved that the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs be instructed to in quire into the expediency of famishing relief to the starving population of Ireland, and to report by bill or otherwise. Mr. 

WICKLIFFE of Kentucky, from the Committee on Military Affairs, reported a bill authorizing the raisingoi a volunteer force for the better defence of Kentucky. The House postponed till Thursday its con sideration of the various slavery propositions, inconsequence of Tuesday and Wednesday being occupied in eulogies* on Senators Baker and Bin.gV.Kin. Mr. STEVENS of Pa. has moderated Ins K'solutions in several important particulars. Mr. HUTCHINS of Ohio introduced a bill, unconditionally abolishing slavery in the Dis trict of Columbia.

On motion of Mr. COX of Ohio it was re solved that the Csmmittec ou Ways and Means be instructed to consider the tariff and taxa tion, with a view to equalize the burdens of the present war. 

SECRETARY CHASE’S REPORT. Condition of the Treasury—Schemes lor future Revenue—Our Debt and what It will he. York, Dec. 9.—The Secretary of tho Navy s Report, after referring to the recommen dations contained in his July Report, gives the manner in which he obtained loans for the va rious purposes of Government. The immedi ate exigencies were provided for by issuing $14,019,034, in 6per cent two-years Treasury notes, and $12,877,750 in the same notes, pay able in sixty days. His next care was to pro vide for disbursements for the war, and he adopted, as the plan, to engage the banking institutions of the three commercial cities of the seaboard to advance the amount needed, in loans for three years of 7 3-10 per cent, bonds, to be reimbursed from the proceeds of similar bonds subscribed for by the people, hoping thus to combine the capital of the banks and tho people with the credit of the Government, so as to give effi ciency to administrative action and competent support to public credit; and the result has fulfilled the hope. He then rehearses the agreement entered into between the banks and himself, by which the former agreed to take the loans. The history of the first two loans has been made public. The second loan was negotiated with the banks on the 16th of November, by which he agreed to issue to them 50,000,000 in 6 per cent, bonds sit par for bonds bearing 7 per cent, interest. This agreement was conpled with no ar rangement for re-embursement and en tailed no expense, except the preparing and issuing the bonds. This was al so complied with. The option to the banks is T that on or after the Ist of January, a fourth ruh ance of fifty millions should be made, on the same terms as the first or sec ond, if required. In addition to these loans, $21,165,25), up to Nov. 30th, were issued in Treasury notes, of fives, tens, and twenties, payable on demand; $3,335,105 remaining in the Treasury. Tliis amount maybe regarded as a loan from the people. The aggregate realized from loans in various forms,*is $197,- 742,588. The revenue receipts have not fulfilled his expectations. He says an act modifying the rates of duties differed from the measure he submitted to Congress in most of these par ticulars, especially in diminished duties oa tea, coffee and sugar, and exempting goods in warehouse and on shipboard. The difference was disadvantageous; while a potential cause of reduced receipts may be. found in the changed circumstances of the country, prov ing unfavorable to foreign commerce.’ These circumstances compel“him to reduce his estimates for 1562, from the revenue, from fifty-seren millions dollars to $32,108,602. The estimates from receipts from lands and miscellaneous sources, he reduces from three millions to $3,304,062. The onlv other source of revenue is a direct tax, author ized by Congress, which, if increased to the limit proposed by the Secretary and assumed by States, the further sum of 830,000,000 may be expected- The aggregate of revenue may be thus estimated at $54,552,600, which & $25,447,334 less than the estimate of Julv. The secretary states that the estimates for July were based on the raising of 350,000 vol unteers, and an increase of the regular annv hy eleven regiments; hut after that report had been closed, Congress authorized the accept ance bv the President of 500,000 men, besides additional companies and officers. This large increase has and must necessarily augment the expenditures far beyond the lUnit indica ted by the original estimates, which will be still further extended by the increase of the navy; andadditionalappropriations areasfced for. Of these additional appropriations, $47,985,566 were authorized by acta of the last session, and $143,130,937 are now asked for, n nking an agu egate, including $23,787,933 for mdCMihc appropriations, of $313,- 904,437. To prOTide these large sums, retrenchment and reform are indispensable. C( ntracts should be subjected to strict super vision, and contractors to a vigorous respon sibility. All unnecessary offices should be abolished, and salaries and pay materially re duced. , ‘While thus recommending retrenchment, he feels himself constrained to renew sugges tions heretofore submitted by-him, that the property of rebels should be made to pay, in part, at least, the cost of the re. hellion. Property of great value in loyal States is held by. proprietors virtually engaged in a guilty attempt to break up the Union, which is justly forfeited to the people, and which should be subjected to sequestration orconfiscatlonj.and theprocceds applied to the satisfaction of rlnims arising from the war. The property of rebels in rebellious States should be treated in the same manner. Their rights to “ser vices,” under State laws, must of necessity form an exception to any rule of confiscation. Persons held by rebels under such laws to ser vice as slaves may, however, be justly liberat ed from their constraint and made more valu able in various employments through volun tary and compensated service, than if con fiscated as subjects of property. - The Secretary says the most sacred duty of the _American people now requires the conse cration of all their energies and resources to the establishment of the Union, and sound policy would seem to suggest no extension of foreign trade, but more absolute reliance on American labor, American skill, and American soiL. He recommends that the duties on tea, coffee-and sugar be increased to 2>f cents !b; on brown, ana on clayed sugars cents; to 20 cents on green tea; to 5 cents on coffee; and that no other alterations of the tariff be made imless further experience shall demonstrate the necessity. He deems it necessary to increase the direct tax so as to produce from loyal States a revenue of at least $20,000,000 estimating such duties on stills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bank notes, carriages, lega cies, on paper, evidences of debt, and con veyances of property, and other like property, as will produce an equal additional sum. The income tax will probably produce $10,000,000 icons making an aggregate of $50,000,000. The secretary is aware that the sum is Large, bat seeingno probability of the revenue exceed ing (530,000 during the current year, he feels that he must not shrink from a plain tion. Two-fifths of one per cent, on th£ real statement of the actual necessities of the sitna and personal property of loyal States will produce $41,000,000, the proposed income adding $10,000,000 more. The Secretary recommends a plan for a na tional circulation of notes, the features of which are a circulation of notes bearing a com mon impression, and authenticated by com mon authority; the redemption of those notes by associations and institutions to which they may be delivered for issue, and the security of that redemption by pledge of United States stocks, and an adequate provision of specie. An important advantage to the people by this plan, would be in the increased security of the Union, springing from common interests la its preservation, created by a distri bution of its stocks to associations through out the country as the basis of their circulation, and he entertains the opinion if a credit circulation be desirable, it is most desi rable in this form. He states it is most earnestly hoped, and not without sufficient grounds, jtliat the present war be brought to an auspicious termination before midsummer, and that in that event the provision of reve nue by taxation recommended will amply suf fice for all financial exigencies with out additional loans, and enable the Government at once to begin a reduction of the existing debt. If the war continues to July Ist, 1802, the public debt will be $517,- 322,802; if till July Ist, 1863, it will be in round numbers, $900,000,000. The prohibition of trade with the rebel States has been fully enforced. Regulations have been established bv which rice, cotton and other property in the insurrectionary dis tricts occupied by our troops,will be collected and sent by sea to New York. All sales will be for account of the Government, and the proceeds paid into the National Treas ury. As a general rule, commerce should follow the flag, and when the authority of the Union is fully restored in States, ports' should be opened without restriction and all com merce freely permitted. The Secretary closes bv saving it has been his endeavor to infuse into his Department the greatest possible activity and vigor, and he hopes that continued endeavor, with larger experience, will make it what it ought to be.
