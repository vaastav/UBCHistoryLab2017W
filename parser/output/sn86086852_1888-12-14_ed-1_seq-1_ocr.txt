England had, ir 1882, 3,500 students in her universities, out of a population of 26,000,v/00, and Germany, with a popn lation of 45 250,000, had 24,000 students.

Oonobkksman Mobeow a suggestion that our resident Chinese be compelled to register, on pain of expulsion, would seem an effective way to prevent the smuggling of coolies into ihe country, if the memory of the trade in fraudulent certificates of residence under the old law were not still vidid. Cor.oKADo bids fair to vie with Wyom ing for the (iis'iaotiun of being a great oil state.

The day is not far distant when the li jcky Mountain bolt will supply the world with oil. The dispatch of a few days ago stating that Persia has refused an exequator to a Russian consul a! MeacheJ, where a Brit ihh consul has long been stationed, is now followed by the report that Russia will and maud the admission of her consul there. It seems that England has been quietly making herself solid with Persia, as a flank movement against the ezir. lx is really painful to contemplate what j may happen when the lowa Legislature | is brought face to face with all the do- , tails of the now Western railroad trot, or j “agreement,” as it is called. The lowa | Legislature is the most extreme state s i rights body on the footstool just stw j | and runs against a Federal court pretty ■ wnrlr every move it makes. ! A will has just been sustained in New York in which the testator ordered that ! nue of his children should mary under | 26 years of age, or sleep in bed later than j 9in the morning. If a will like that will ! stand it is no use to ta'k of contesttng | any will on the ground of insanity.

Hkbrtof.jiie, railroad passes have not only been given to all member* of the Wisconsin Legislature but to their (ami I *en and friend* and neighbor*, and any body for whom they were asked. Now the railroads propose to give away no ' panweH hrve to members, units* perchance i some drastio granger legislation is pro posed, when parse n and money will be dealt out with a lavish hand. These abusive discriminations may account, in some degree for the hostility of the aver age western granger to the roads, I,oho Kinuiili’ii Cuukchill is proving a great success as a thorn in the llesh of the British lories, lie is of them, but be is also after them about half the time. Twice during the few weeks of this sis sion he has given the government a gen nine scare. He first attacked depart ment extravagance, and Tuesday night his motion to adjourn in order to discuss the aendiug of troops to Smkim preoipi fated a hot debate. Army movements in Egypt is a sore poiut to the British, whosi occupation of that country does not fui'iiisli a glorious chapter to til" his tory of the empire. The wide spread fear that, the red-coats are spoil the eve i of another ill fated campaign gave ! point to Ohurohill’s attack, and the vote on the division showed how deep this fear is.

Thk iuslralmn ballot system will go Into effect in Massachusetts two years hsiiee, and it will then bes; "ii how mu rli the espionage of employers, tolerated under existing election laws, has affected the votes of the workingmen. Under this law no employer or his detective can find out how his men have voted, as the men will go into the pulling booths alone. Each one will check off the names of the candidates from the long roll of the single ballot, that he desires to vote for, and he wilt deposit his ballot folded and unseen by any one. The same law, in ef foot, was pa sed by the New York legis latnre last winter and vetoed by Governor Hill. It will doubtless be passed again at the coming session at Albany, but it is not likely to receive the gubernatorial indorsement, and in all probability the tirst election to be held in this country under a Ins of this kit'd will be held in Massachusetts, The charges of intim datum and wholesale corruption, which have become so general since the elec line, may lead to the passage of similar laws in other states in the near future. 

EDISON S I.VTbWT INVENTION Thomas A. K.dison’s phonograph is to be applied to furnishing a talking daily newspaper, according to the Nr York World. To obtain the news the anbscrib er will have to turn the crank and listen as the news is reeled off. Some time ago Mr. F lison succeeded in turning out what he calls correspondence phonograms which are of a peculiar waxy con position, and can be folded and pot in an envelope, like' a letter. When the message which has been true and upon them is to be made audible, they are wrapped atoond the phonographic cylinder, and by a revolu tion of the motor, *he sounds of the voice are produced. It is said that 20,000 or more of these correspondence phono grams can b* turned out in an hour, and that they can be adjusted to any phono graph. This discovery is said to have suggested to the inventor the plan of utilizing it for a talking newspaper The phonograms will contain each day the latest news in a condensed form, and will cover each subdivision such as the cable and telegraphic, commercial, etc,, each being marked so that the hearer may choose. If anew opera has been produced the night before, for instance, he can listen to a criticism of it. and eu joy the novel sensation of hearing the choicest passages of the music precisely n they were rendered at the theater Any matter of news which embodies the speaking wf one or more people can be reported so that|the phonograph snbscrib er can imagine himself present and list ening to them. It is not expected that the talking newspaper will achieve all its possibilities at once, the design at first being to provide merely a synopsis of daily news, which will be furnished to subscribers so that they may hear it while at breakfast. It is stated that whereas formerly the phonograph was only within the reach of the wealthy, it will soon be brought so low in price that people of moderate means can possess one. The phonograms, as now made, would cost 20 cents a cylinder, but as they are perfected the price is expected to be much lower. vol. mu. THE

A Crippled Indian Girl Beaten With a Walk ing Stick.

TRUTHS ABOUT THE FLY What is Known About His Wonderful Organism. How Ho Crawls and Walks How Liquids are Devoured—His Hear ing and Seeing Apparatus. "Biby bye. here's a tl .-. Let us watch, yoa aad I." Let ns, “children of larger growth,” watch him, too. Perhaps in suca a ossa he will expect to be addressed as musca domestica. To follow the poet’s train of thought “How he crawls, cp the walls, yet he never fails.” The former theory that this is accom plished by suction as a brick can be raised from the ground by a piece of wet. leather, is exploded. And we are now told, on French authority, that it is due to the presence of the many minute hairs on the feet, from ten to twelve thousand in all, each terminating in a bclb, which by exuding an oily liquid adheres to sur faces by capillary attraction. When the fly tries to walk up a wet surface the moisture prevents the oil from coming in contact with the surface, and so there is no attraction and consequently no sue cess. Dost acts in an equally uafavora ble way by clogging in the hairs, which must, therefore, be kept perfectly clean. ■Rubbing the legs together partly cleanses them, but not perfectly, so the tty curry combs himself by passing the legs ove wings, on which are roagu hairs. Bat the head is supplied with a different kind, so these are also utilized as brushes. Anyone who lias used a tty toilet, and who has not? must have wondered how so large a head, working on so sma'l a pivot, could be so roughly pulled about without danger of decapitation. Go to the tty thoa officeholder and learn how to keep yoar head on. A French writer says “the walking of insects may bo compared to that of three men in Indian Tile; the foremost and hindmost of whom keep step, while the middle one walks in the alternate step.” If humanity employed such a oomph x system of locomotion as this, what a stupeuduous accomplishment bay’s tirst step would then be a matter of far more vital import than now. To walk on a vertical plane with six feet to be man aged in this prepiexing way, would it not need the waole of the ocriod of legal infanthood to btoocos an accomplished pedestrian? This is one of the oases where a “critique of jure reason” would seem to prove that even when it is com bined with experience it falls short of instinct. Toward the end of autumn the flies sometimes have a rheumatic appear auco, tiudi&g difficulty in detaching the feet. It is supposed that age and infirm ity have left them too weak to lilt the feet with the necessary force. Perhaps, after the manner of humanity, some who have been in a warmer place and are le>s stiff than the rest, jeer at their compan ions, and tell them that their feet are so large that when they once get them plant ed, it requires super fly strength to raise them. In speaking of the instrument by which the fly sucks up liquids, oue good author ity says: “It is impossible to describe this beautiful structure intelligibly.” In view of this statement, I think a becom ing modesty would require me to pass over the subject lightly, especially us after reading the description, I fully agreed with the writer. However I will quote another writer on fho subject; “When the fly settles ou p. lump of sugar or other sweet substance, it unbends and extends its tongue, and the knot like ecd divides into two broad leaves which pre sent a sucker-like surface, rough like a rasp, and as it is by menus of this that the fly causes mischief to book covers nud teases us in summer by sipping the perspiration. Any solid sweet substance is first dissolved by the fly’s saliva and can then be sipped up." We are told that when wo see dead flies with whitish bodies fastened to the ob ject they are on. We know that they have died from eating some poisonous substance, or from over-eating any food. Wherefore I conclude that in fly ethics gluttony is one of the mortal sins. Youthful humanity is taught that the possession of two eyes, and ouly one ton gue, tf aches that oue should see twie: as much as ho tells. But on this principle, mamma fly must teach her young hope ful that he must see 1,000 times as much as he telle musoa domeetioa would servo for a model school master in that he has eyes in the back of his head; being thus endowed not only with foresight, but w.'h retrospection and circumspection. Oar two eyes give lint one image to the brain, ao the 4,000 fooete of the flies do not show him 4,000 dangers where one lurks. Yet he is as alert as if ha saw 4,- 000 pressing upon him from all sides. Prove it by engaging iu the infantile amusement of chasing one over a window pain and after a few minutes you wdi ac knowledge that child’s pla y is not the proper name for the work. If you are a good hunter yon may corner your prey, but with a fair full and ho favor he is too much for you.” “Semper Paratus” must be hie watchword. He does not oc casionally take a swing in what a chi''J lately called a hammock foi bugs, the spider’s web, but tiie ogre entraps him not chases him. The fly is supposed to hear through ils antennae or horns as they are sometimes called. These consist of threu joints with a plume projecting from the lower one. The sense of smell probably resides in tho aluiets or little wings, the second pair. There seems, however, to be some doubt about this in the minds of the en tomologists, but not in regard o tbeir other use, that of balancing the fly ia its flight, as removing one or both produces in the fly tl e effect of balancing to part ners. The aluiets are also called balan cers. The wings pmoper, instead of being composed of only one membrane, as they appear to the naked eye are formed of two membranes joined at the edges. The black lines that we see ruaning through them act as ribs of an umbrella to keep the membranes stretched in place. Being hollow they are supposed to act a* pass ages to produce the buzzing sound. The wings ia ordinary flight ere moved about 6‘io times in a second and carry the fly five feet; but if necessary this can be in creased to thirty fee', a second, one third as far as a race horse conid go in the same time. We are told n single fly can produce 746,496 young in three months, laying about 120 eggs cylindrical in form and jointed at tbe end; the surface shining like the mother of pearl. After about twenty-four hours tne larva leaves the egg and lives in any kind of fiith. The next change .* into a cylindrical redd-sh brown pupa, from which the perfect fly issues in about weeks from the time of fastening.” In view of such a great and ra pic. increase it will be readily seen that bat few are needed to winter over in order that tbe supply may exceed the de mand early in the season. These few are supposed so retire into a state of “in nocuous desuetude” near chimrev or other warm place, when the cold days come. It is also thought that a few pass the winter in the pupa state. Tney have the Minerva tike quality of entering up on life full grown, as all the growth is made in the larva state. So that those of different sizes are not of different ages, but of different species. As is usual in the insect world in contrast with the birds, the female is larger ttoan the male. From Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strand they are col -idtred a nuismee. Oae of thec-ld monkish chron icles is reported as saying that “the father of lies might well have been e&lied the father of flies,” and this I think still voices popular opinion of the subject. We know their usefulness as scavengers bat we cannot like them. Yet there is one time when they are welcome. Tbe first fly of the season, is equal to the first dandelion, or ’he first robin in its full as I snracce that spring has really come. They follow man all over the world so ! clos-ly that when an. an know a island is j reached one may know whether or not it | is inhabited by their presence or absence. It is calculated that if one of each spe r oiesof living obj ots were to stand in a I row, the fiy would occupy (he middle space between the two extreme, of size. ; Does it not therefore follow by easy rsa roning tha* the tty is the most truly ; mean object known? ( Oar argus eyed 1 iitie friend with the wings of a fairy, the probosis of an ele | phaut, the toilet motions of a cat using ! ins lesser wings as a l ose, his antennas as i ear', what n curious compound ha is. i Considered abstractly, how wonderful the , filmy gauze of the wings. Bat when we , come to stern reality, and are in the right—or the wrong—ra tod. still the won der grows that that filmy gauze can make 'such au amount of nerve-racking noise. Wonderful stories are told of their vi tality ; how they have lived in bottled wine tor months, being exported to Eng land in the interim and needing only a sun bath to revive them when released. Their endurance of cold was proved by a person, who, resolving to test their vitsli ty, held one one on a piece of ice until it froze fast; and when, on its being releas ed, it flew away, she believed ihe hitherto incredible accounts. One that I once rescued from an ice-watery grave in early winter for a long time showed no sign of resuscitation; but after I had placed it with its head to the north, that the elec tric currents might have their tail effect, it began to show signs of returning con sciousness, and I was soon able to pro nuance it discharged cured, and to say: Then away, dr n t rt y- Lhtle tly. goo I day, good dry. THE STORY OF A SPEC THAI. DOG. How a Wreck ou the rennsylvania Road Was Fortunately Averted. New York Tribune. A Tribune reporter was sitting on one of ihe seats on the Battery promenade recently when a well dressed woman passed, leading by a strap a snow-wtio tjpiiz d-:g. A man dnsso-i in the garb of a laborer sat on the seat next to the reporter, smoking a short-stemmed cob pripe. “Talking about strange tilings,” said the laborer, nudging the news-galh rrer. “I utver see a white dug bat what it oahs up a strange experience I had while firing ou the Pennsylvania railroad ten years ago. I was in the cab with Tommy Barns, one of the best engineers in the com pany’s service, and our run wa-i between Jersey City and Philadelphia. We left Jersey City at 1) o'clock one Silnrday evening, pulling a long tram of passenger coaches and three Pullmans. The cars were all fall and we had the r.ght of wa , stops except at Market street, NewarWSjid Trenton. We rolled along ail right over the liaokensack meadows and after we left Newark we struck a s'xty miles an hour pace, and watched the tele graph poles flash by till they loooked like the teeth of a fine-tooth comb. We had struck the plain at Princeton junction when Burns, who was looking out of the cab-window, save to me: “Look-a-here Jack! There is a white dog runnin’ alongside what's been follow in’ us for live minutes and blamed if he ain’t keepiu’ up to the iujiue. Look at him.” “I was shoveling coal in the furnace at the time and the heat was blistering my eyeballs in their sockets. It took me some time after gazing out of the window before I could make out the dog. Final ly I saw him shimmering along like a swallow. Now in the glare from the win dow be could be plainly seen, then he would get out in the line of the darkness and wc would lose sight of him. But he would be sure to show up again in a few minutes. Ditches cuts, and short bends, it was all the samt, that white dog stuck beside the cab as steady as its shadow. Burns and I couldn’t make it out. First we thought our eyesight was deceiving us, for the awful heat from the furnace, the sharp wind or something else, or all of these things put together is terribly trying on One’s eyes who nas to use them in an engine cab. The sight gets binrrtd and cloudy, and sometimes yoa see and jub’o and sometimes you don’t see half. Well, Burns and I thought at first we vs ore fo sled by our eyes, and there couldn’t be any dog. But mi e after mile that white dog was alongside. ‘■Jack says Bures, all at once, ‘this is moie’n I kin stand. If oar eyes ain't mussed up there's something wroeg somewhere. I'm a goin’ to stop her.’ “Sure enough, he sloped, and we both got off the cab. The conductor came running up and wanted to know what in the blue blazes was the matter. We told him about the white dog running along side the engine, and we looked about to show him the blamed animal. But, to our surprise, there was no dog to be seen, and, hunt high and hunt low, we could not find him. The conductor laughed at ns, and Burns and I got aboard again, think ing that after all our eyes might have fooled us. Burns pulled back the throttle and we started off slowly. There was a curving out just ahead of us. Fifty yards from it, before the wheels had fair ly begun to revoWe good, the headlight flashing on the track before rs showed ns a rock that must have weighed two ons on our track. We sloped the engine with the cow catcher not twelve inches fn m the stone, which loosened b? rains had rolled down from the bank. Had we not sloped on account of that while dog we would have struck it ou full headway and yon can see what that would have meant. I got shaky soon after that and resigned, and the very mention of a whits dog. much less the sight of one, brings that strange ride back to me.” Duelling in the South- The whole question of duelling, as moderately viewed in the south nowadays, is cmoisely stated in a story fold by Colonel Lewis Clark, President of the Louisville Jockey Club. He is now in New York winding up the business of the American Turf Congress, which, under the spur of his suggestion, has placed the book-makers in subjection, and probably saved the nobles', of sports from the dis graceful downfall which rumor- or dis honestly threatened. “Ihere is no ne oetsityfor public talk about a difficulty between gentlemen,” said Colocel Clark. In Louisville I have a frieed in an odd, quiet sort of a mac, a physician named Bill* White. He is the most inoffensive of men. He never looked f<T an insult and never brooked oae. He was in a game of poker, and one of the party, who hau lost considerable money, suddenly left us. and in leaving made a ra her sharp remark to Dr White. In purely a spirit of fun I suggested to the doctor that he had been insul'ed. “D ) you think he meant it that way. Lewis!” he quietly inquired. ‘Why certainly,’ I replied. ‘Lewis, step across the street to his office with me,’ he said iu a low tone of voics. I did so. He confronted the man who ! just left us, and in a drawling tone said; ‘Charley, the boys tell me that they be lieve that yon intended your last remark as an insult to me.’ ■‘ ‘Nonsense,’ a lid the other; T certainly didn’t mean anything of the kind.’ “ ‘Then, Charley,’ said the doctor, come across the s'rett and tell the boys so.’ “‘Oh, I can't do that,’ said the one ad dressed. ‘“AU right, then, Charley.' said White, with a quiet drawl, ‘you had bettor get a friend and a pistol, for when I come across the street again I'll come a-thoot in',’ The idea I wish to convey,” con tinued Colonel Clark, “is that when a man has been wronged he does not require seconds, nor need be employ a type writer to set him right.” Wisconsin [Vstm-asters- Wasbisoton, Dec. 10.— The president to day appointed the following pis mis ters; Emii Drews. Lancaster, W.s : Myron Heed, Waupaca, Wis. The p.uhl c and private improvements at Chippewa Foils the past season repre sent an outlay of $300,000.

DEFENDED THE LAW. A State Steamer Charges an Oyster Fleet with Terrible Effect. Baltimom, Deo. 11.—Last night's fight between the state steamer McLean and a fleet of oyster flredgns at work in Viola tion of law at the mouth of the Chester river may have itsulted in considerable loss of life, as Peter Mullen, coos of the schooner Julia A. Jones, says he was the only man out of a crew of eleven to escape. The slate vessel was ho ly attacked by the dredgers who were heavily armed with repealing rifles and did -not return the lire until com iKiled to. The steamer M-Lsue was t’.orou,'ley nddied with bullets and Capt. 11 'ward determined to resort to extreme measures. Baok’ug *he steamer iIT trom a fleet of sevtn dredg ers, which were tied together ho singled ont the Julia A. Jones, an I putting on a full turd ot seam muds and reotly for her stern, striking her fairly and the sc’, miner sank almost instantly Mullen escaped by climbing up the steamers’anchor chain. Out says the res’ of the crew were la the fore peak, and could not have go ten out. As soon as the MeLine got cleared tfom the wreoa she was again bached off and again headed tor the fleet, striking the schooner J. C. Maloney squarely iu the s’ern. She at oneo com menced to sink and thn re maindtr of the fleet go* away as fast as possible. Some ot the ctow of the Maloney escaped by climbing ou board the McLauo and as each one came aboard he was put in the hold. A white man riftirud Colemm and u negro named Bramble of the crew of the Maloney are believed to have been and. owned as they were, not seer; after the vessels were struck. A large tl*et of dredges is reported to be m unlawful ground tonight, and it is not unlikely but there wdl be another fight before morning. Disastrous Explosion iu a Colorado Mine. Canon City, Colo., D. o. 11. An ex plosion occurred in shaft No. 2, of the Confitli coal mine last night, killing two men outright and fataly injuring tenor a dozsu others. The mine had been on fire since last Thursday and last night a gang went down to endeavor to extin guish it when the explosion occurred by the ignition of gas iu some unknown manner. The mine is badly damaged. THE CHICAGO EXCLUSION. The Force Unprecedented—The Extent of the Wreck and t lie Amount of the Loss. Chioaoj, Deo. 11 —An explosion that shattered (Liver's big oat meal mill on Halstead st reet, near the viaduct,destroy ed Jacob Press’ wagon factory, James McCormick’s saloon, and Jacob Heng’s Farmers’ Home, occurred in the oat meal mill at 2 o'clock this morning. Three men are known to have been killed, one faiaily injured, aad a number of people were badly brnistd and shaken up. Chief Swenie, who lives on Pierce street, three quartets of a mile south of the mill, said that the force of the explosion threw him out ot bed. There was not a wtiole pane of glass left in any building within a quarter of a mile of the mill. U re ami there the panels of a door wore blown ont. And this was one of the curious features of the accident. The glass and woodwork were pushed ont instead of smashed in as one would natnrs’.iy expect. The proprietor and manager ot the mill were on the ground early, but have been unable to learn positively the cause of the explosion. Each thinks that oat meal dust may have caused it, bnt the ti-rntic force is unprecedented if this theory be accepted. No other reasonable explanation is offered, however, and the explosion of dust is accepted, until n bet ter reason is found. The fire seemed to spring op almost before the rumble of the explosion died ont, and in less timoAfian it takes to tell it the whole wreck was in flames. Sparks that were carried through the air by the wind ignited buildings two blocks away, and. for half an hour the chemical com panies had all they could do to prevent half a dozsn serious coufligations. The streets wore filled with debris for a block on every side of the burned patch, and this seriously obsti noted the firemen in their work. They stumbled over boards and timbers and debris un til their clothes were torn, their hands anti faces cut and their limbs so badly stiffened that they could scarcely walk. But, notwithstanding these terrible obstacles, the firemen worked c-o until the danger was over. By 9 o’clock the fire department had susoaeded in extinguishing the fire, and the work of excavating in the roius was begun. About 10:30 o’clock the body of Charles Miller, the engineer, was foaud in the north driveway of the mil). It was cov ered with about three feet of ashes, the lower part covered with bruises and burns, and the face so mangled as to be unrecognizable. He was 30 year? old, and leaves a wife and three children. Shortly af’er his remains were found the body of Ernst Casper was discovered. He was lying on his back, his charred, blackened head rested on a step of a stairway. His hands and feet were burned to a cinder. Hundreds of men searched anxiously for the missing millers, and after some time one of them, John Holmes, was found lying in the alley across the street from the mili terribly burned and lacerated. He was working in the second story of the nr 11 when the explosion oc curred and was hurled through u window and across the street. He cannot live. The loss will aggregate $150,000.

DOES CANADA GIVE UP? Transhipment of Halibut Allowed at Halilsi The Consul General in Con-taut Communi cation wilh Bayard on the Matter. Hallifai, Dec. 11. —Ac important move in the practical settlment of the vita! point in the fi-herics controversy was made here yesterday. The American schooner N. A. Banks arrived from NO. 19. the banks with a cargo of hali but. She came into port ostensibly “for repairs" under the tresty of ISIS. Capt. Campbell decided to land part of his cargo here, enter it at customs, pax duty and tranship the balance to Boston. He lauded SOflO pounds of halibut, packed the fish oa the public wharf, right endsr the noses of the customs officers and delivered it to the agents for the Boston, Halifax Jc Prince Ed ward Steamship line, who shipped it on the steamer Cartoft which satis for Boston to-dsy. The shipment w.xs not made under the modus vivendi, but under he rights claimed by the United States under the bonding arrangements of the treaty of M s.xh’ngtoa. It is known that Consul General Phelauwasiu coustautul egraphic communication with Secretary Bayard all day. The dominion officials know all abont the transhipment, and the fact that they have not interfered is tak-n as evidence that it was made with the approbation of tha Canadian govern meut, and that it betokens the abandon ment of the vital feature of the Can ad-an position, and the only prominent point in dispute in the fishery ijueslion.

Chicago, Deo. 11.—Judge C.xoley laid down the laws to the managers and general passenger agents of the various railroad* to day. About two hundred officials assembled iu the committee room of the central traffic association to hear w hat the chairuiui of the inter-state com meroe ec uimission had to sly. The judge unmercifully scored those roads that had been guilty of di.-criaiinstiou in pss-eu ger rates by cetiling secretly with scalp ers. He mentioned no names, but he gave them to understand that, ho knew which were the guilty ones and that he had sufficient evidence in his possession to convict them of frequent violations e>f the law. He told them the pernicious practice would have to be stopped a once or the offenders would be prose cutei. Mr. Cooley tailed for nearly an hour, and at the close of his speech Col. Morrison made a few re-marks on i'ne same subject. Immediately after the ad joarnuient exf the meeting the general passemger agents con voted and talked over the situation. The lines between Chicago and S'. I*.nil and those between Chicago and Omaha agreed to give the necessary tern days notice to morrow of the restoration of the pas senger rates between those points.
