The Indian Bureau. The work in kfe Indian bureau in the ax* sforeeutlon of the policy of reoent legislation has '^iJtaen largely directed to chief purposes, first, the alloi ment of lands in leveraltv to th« Indians ana tne cession to tne united mates of the surplus lands and, secondly, to the work of educating the Indians for their own protection in closer contaot with the white man ar.dfor tue intelligent exercise of his new citizenship. Allotments have been made Ud patents issued to 5,900 Indians under the present secretary and commissioner, and 7.60J Additional allotments have been mode for which patents are now in process of prepara­ tion. The school attendance of Indian children has been inoreased during that time over 13 per cent., enroll ment for 1892 being nearly twenty thou­ sand. A uniform system of soliool textbook's •nd ot study has been adopted, and the work in these natioual schools brought as near as mav be to the basis of the free common schools of the states. These schools uiay be trans ferreJ and merged into the common school •yBtems in the states when the ludian has fully assum-.d his new relation to the organ­ ized civil community in which he resides and the new states are able to assume the burden. Conduct of Indiau Agents. I have several times been called upon to re­ move Indian agents appointed by me, and have done so promptly upon every sustained oomplaiut.of unfitness or misconduct. 1 be lieve, however, thai*the ludian service at the agencies has been improved, and is now ad­ ministered on the whole with a good decree of efflclenoy If any legislation is possible by which the selection of Indian agents can be wholly removed from all partisan suggestion or considerations, I am sure it would be a great relief to the executive und a great bene •flt to the service.

What Uncle Jerry's Department Has Done for the Farmer, The report of the secretary of agriculture contains not only a most lnterestinn state­ ment of the progressive and valuable work done under thi administration of Mecretaiv Rusk, uut many for the enlarged usefulness of this important department. In the successful effort to break down the restrictions to tin free introduce of our meat products in the untries of E irope, the secretary has been intiring from the first, stimulating and aid­ ing all other government officers, at home and broad, whose official duties caused them to mcipate in the work. The total trade in ome products with Europe in May, 1892, .mounted to 

82,OOU.OOO pounds, against 4U.91H), pounds in the same month of 1891. iu June, W, the exports aggregated 85,7U ,'U.O pounds ainst 46,DOU,OOU pound* in the same month of the previous year in July there wasanin ireasu of 41 per cent, and in August of 55 per cent over the corresponding week of 1801. Over 40,tiuo,(XX) pounds of inspected pork have een exported since tha law was put into op­ eration, and a comparison of the four months of May, June, July and August, 1892, with the same months of 1891 shows an increase in tne number of pounds of our export of pork prod­ ucts of 6* per cent, and an inorease in value of «6«. The exports of dressed beef increased from 137,900,0 IU0 pounds in 1889 to 220.800, 01) pounds in 1892. or about 60 per cent. During the past year there has been exported 894,607 head of live stock cattle as against 205,786 exported in 1889, This increased exportation has been largely promoted by the inspection authorized .y law and the faithful efforts of the^secretary and his efficient subordinates to mafrie: that inspection thorough and to cure fully exclude from all cargoes diseased or inspected cattle. .' Enormous Agricultural Exports. Agricultural products constitute 78.1 p«r cent, ot our unprecedented exports for the fiscal year which closed June 80, 1892, the total exports bein- 1,030,287,130. and the value of the.agricultural products ^793,717,676, which exceeds by more than $150,000,000 the shipment if agricultural products in any previous year. Bulk's Suggestions Commended. The suggestions of the seoretary for an en­ largement of the work of the department are recommended to your favotable considera­ tion. It may be, I think,tsald without chal­ lenge that in no corresponding'period has io :h been done as during the last four years the.benefit of American agriculture. Quarantine Inspection. «-subjects of quarantine regulations, lo­ tion and control were brought suddenly my attention by the arrival at our ports in st last of vessels infected with cholera.

Negro Lynching* Condemned. Lawlessness is not less suoh, but more, where it usurps the fuootious of the peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynch ings of colored people accused of crime is without the excuse which has sometimes been urged by mobs for a failure to pursue methods for the punishment of crime that the accused has had an undue influence over cenrts and Juries. Suoh acts area reproach to tbe community where they ucur, and so far astbeyoaobe made the sub ct of federal jurisdiction the strongest rep, ssive legislation is demanded. No lesson nee to be so urgently impressed upon our peo) '0 as this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness. In Conclusion.

And this brief ex­ hibit of the trowth and prosperity of the country will tr ve us a level fiom which to note the iuci 'USO or decrease that new legis­ lative policies may brim? to us. Theie is no reason why the national influence, power and prosperity should not observe the same rut.es of increase that have characterized the paot thirty years. We carry the great impulse »o ocr«ase of these years into the future, 'her* is no reason why in many llces of tb- production we should not surpass all other cations as we have already done in some. There are no near frontiers to our possible development. Retro­ gression would be a crime. [Signed] 

BENJAMIN HARRISON. Senate. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—A most unusual incident in the proceedings of the senate was the offering of an opening prayer by the Jewish Rabbi, Rev. Dr. Joseph Silverman, Rabbi of Temple Manuel New York. Mr. Hill (democrat, .New York) in­ troduced a bill to repeal the Sherman silver purchase act. Referred to com­ mittee on finances. Petitions for and against the anti option bill poured in upon the senate to-day, and nearly all the southern states were represented. The petitions covered the country from Delaware to Texas, showing systematic work on the part of the opponents of the bill. It is clear that the south is against the anti option measure, and that its prospect of passage becomes poorer. Senators Washburn, Hansbrough and Allen presented petitions for the bill, but those on the other side outnumbered them ten to one. The senate at 1:15 adjourned, after the announcement of the death of the late representative, McDonald, New Jersey, by Senator McPherson. The St. Paul Weekly Pioneer Press will be better this year than ever.

BISMARCK WEEKLV TRIBUNE: FRIDAY. DEC. 9 1898 OFFICIAL VOTE OF NORTH DAKOTA BY COUNTIES.-1892. Lientenant Governor, 687 600 106 165 50 2122 345 502 204 285 195 1512 226 212 324 94 535 181 70 273 And Speaks on the Misrepresentations of Catholicism Which Often Prevail. He Is an Entertaining and Logical Speaker and Makes an Excel­ lent Impression. How Catholicism Is Misrepresented. The Atheneum was well filled last Monday with persons who were present to hear Bishop Shanley speak on the misrepresentation of Catholicism. The mayor and city council had seats on the stage, and also Father Martin. Th9 bishop was introduced by the mayor with the following words: "I have the pleasure, ladies and gentlemen, to introduced the Right Reverend Bishop Shanley of North Dakota, who will now favor us with one of his most eloquent lectures." The bishop took exception to the ad­ jective used in his introduction, and said his effort was dignified when termed a lecture, claiming it was simply to be a social talk. A talk of a society that had existed for over four centuries, existed in every land and clime where ever lan­ guage was used. A society that was as strong a hundred years ago as now. In its membership was contained the ablest and wisest scholars, and also many who could not read or write. The society was ruled over by one Leo. The bishop went on to give in a general way some historical facts in regard to the church. He said that Catholicism had been misrepresented by the news­ papers, by many of the great authors, and by many who pretened to be schol­ ars, and that it was for the refutation of these falsehoods he was there to address the audience. The bishop said there were two kinds of lies, the material lie, and the formal lie. The material lie was one made unknowingly, and the formal lie known to be a falsehood. Which kind of lies were those scattered broadcast about Catholicism he did not know, but they were lies just the same. Many persons, he continued, believe Catholicism to teach that all persons who do not belong to the Catholic church are doomed to everlasting damnation. This he characterized as an utter falsehood, either ignorant or ma­ licious. Catholicism, he went on, teaches that all persons who endeavor to serve God, as they believe He should be served, will find reward in heaven, and that it teaches also, that only two per­ sons are known to be in hell, Dives and Judas. Beyond this all was conjeoture. As to the general belief that priests can forgive sinB, and that they are paid by the seeker after forgiveness, the bishop said he admitted the first part. Priests act as mediators between God and men they are the recog­ nized successors of the apostles of Christ, and as such are em­ powered to forgive sins. But he, who seeks forgiveness must be truly and sincerely repentant. And as to the second part of the belief he said it was wickedly false. Persons who think that priests have a regular tariff for forgiving Bins—swear words, $1.50, or six for $5 lies, 10 oents staying away from ohurch, $8 getting drank, 50 cents, and so on— were ignorant and labored ander a mis­ apprehension. Of many other popularly ridiculous beliefs he spoke. The pope, said he, was the head of the ohnrdh, as all societies have a head. He was the retiognized suooessor of Peter, and as •oah was empowered to settle all dis a&s£' "$&&&& Secretary of 950 338 210 310 12 679 614 398 153 47 1654 863 67H 193 124 153 1676 368 150 415 26 442 119 111 126 56 517 52 1538 59 1175 566 503 177 207 574 411 569 803 229 2226 121 171 49 1996 306 493 204 277 191 1523 220 196 327 Btate Governor. 943 311 214 315 15 705 687 432 167 47 1732 883 673 191 133 157 1609 374 170 439 29 389 119 85 126 58 504 44 1620 58 1157 590 486 204 212 559 4l2 569 878 210 2121 125 163 50 2145 344 526 State State* 921 253 173 299 13 1572 849 641 183 124 158 1493 338 147 417 30 393 101 56 120 44 485 48 1507 50 1129 542 415 196 217 512 341 560 642 209 2020 107 162 49 2024 3(J7 '501 202 274 186 1555 241 201 289 85 524 134 96 275 30 399 37 915 121 806 546 564 261 334 611 366 480 16912 State Sapt. of Public I ns traction Auditor. 806 329 214 311 15 590 401 154 44 664 526 371 151 39 1675 880 662 195 135 163 1575 349 161 483 32 412 116 72 124 55 508 51 1613 56 1145 596 484 205 222 575 393 542 790 214 2161 125 161 54 1920 311 482 199 271 178 1547 212 199 265 87 471 188 76 273 29 384 37 1178 121 830 501 521 278 316 582 337 421 692 160 787 158 152 54 194 1644 257 216 356 88 579 202 113 281 40 423 40 1058 127 889 598 642 265 347 652 422 469 1160 170 1054 194 160 48 35 1082 120 842 592 570 294 361 623 353 464 1002 174 953 119 846 556 567 256 346 621 347 455 923 168 987 175 154 43 17203 18943 16814 18930 18239 17516 18689 2116 Addresses a Typical Bismarck Audi­ ence Last Evening at the Atheneum, 15968 Commis­ sioner of Insurance.

Pen nell. The Daly Court Martial. The St. Paul Globe of Saturday pub­ lishes an account of the Daly court martial at Ft. Yates, in which it deliv­ ers an unreserved roast to everyone who sat in the court martial. The Pioneer Press of Sunday says in reply thereto: Much indignation was felt at army head­ quarters here yesterday when the article was read concerning the court martial of Sergeant William Daly at Ft. Yates, which was published in yesterday morning's Globe. The article charges that the regular army officers go into extremes in prefer­ ring charges against subordinates, and cites the case of Dell Wild, about whom so much newspaper talk was made two years ago. It then goes on so say, "It appears that Lieut. Day 'had it in' for Daly and pre­ ferred charges against him, alleging drunkenness and disobedience. Of course, the court martial found him guilty. Courts martial, composed of com­ missioned officers, always convict the men in the ranks but, when the proceedings came before Gen. Merritt for review, he reversed the findings and roasted the court in the following language." Here follows the general's review of the court martial of Sergeant Daly, in which he states that "the latitude of investigation and comment by the defense, permitted by the court is deemed to exceed anything justified by the custom of the service or the demands of justice. For these and other reasons not necessary to enumerate, findings and sen­ tence are disapproved." The facts in the case are that the offense for which Sergeant Daly was court mar tialed was a very slight one and the pun islnnent would have been light. Much unnecessary time was taken up by the court martial in adducing testimony that was entirely uncalled for and irrelevant to the case in hand, and of this the general disapproved. Notice. A special meeting of' the stockholders of the Fairview Cemetery association will be held at the office of the secretary, Saturday, December 10th, at 2 p. m., for the purpose of electing a nev president, and transacting any other business that may, come before them.

JOHN STRUTHEBS, P. B. WEBB, President. Secretary. Jaok the Horse Killer. North Dakota seems to be afflicted with a Jack the horse killer. Not long ago the Niche Oak Leaf chronioled the cutting of a Y-shaped section out of a horse's belly by some miscreant, and now the Lisbon Star reports the shoot­ ing of six horses by some unknown per­ son, presumably for revenge. The mutil­ ation or killing of a horse for the sake of revenge upon its owner denotes bru­ tality and utter ignor&nce, to say the least. Ian Disputes His Cheek—And L,oses. A Sioux Falls special to the Pioneer Press says: In July, 1890, Dan Scott, a newspaper man of this city, whom everybody in the state knows very favorably, had not taken the Keeley treatment, but he had taken a trip to St. Paul.. While there he indulged iu potations wnich rendered him unable to decide rightly what he was doing. On the evening of July 21th Dan fell into bad company. He was surrounded, as he claims, by a lot of gamblers, who induced him to go into a faro game. Dan lost a Sut old watch and chain and $160 in money, still kept at work in the tiger's den. Before the night was over be had drawn two checks, one for $30 and the other for $40, to bearer. The next day Dan came to himself and wired the Dakota ^National bank to stop jpaymeat on the checks Frt- 592 523 343 144 37 1943 273 485 196 271 180 1476 218 192 319 86 533 183 84 273 27 394 34 810 117 851 503 518 238 344 606 321 466 849 154 ai2 150 154 15854 19638 1719 putes relating to church matters. Catholics believed him infallible on church matters, on other matters he was liable to err as is any other human being. The bishop is an entertaining talker, and from his standpoint made an excel­ lent address. He has a* fluent command of language, and is witty in his dis­ course. And it would not do him jus­ tice were it not said that his address was well received and left a good impression wherever it was heard. 15339 18054 1439 15736 Everybody in Bismarck knows Dan Scott, who was with the 

TRIBUNE in the early days. He was an all around good fellow, and a sport, and no matter how much he had dropped on the faro table, would never then have disputed or re­ fused payment on one of his own checks. Dan seems to have changed since "ye olden tyme." Let Us Have Peace, Fargo Republican: There is trouble in the state World's Fair board.' The course of true love never did run smooth. A little more foolishness and the chances for an appropriation will have disappeared. Regarding the above the Grand Forks Herald promptly says: "If a man at­ tempts ito make trouble for the World's Fair board, shoot him on the spot. That there are outside parties who would be glad to embarrass the board even to the extent of defeating a further appropria­ tion and bringing discredit upon the state and its exhibit is more than in­ timated, and The Herald hopes they will desist. However, the Republican will note that only the Argus re-echoes the idle stories of a democratic sheet that there is trouble within the board, stories which the secretary of the board expressly denies. A Pleasing and Auspicious Dedication. The dedication hall at Valley City was crowded Tuesday night with persons who were present to witness the dedi­ catory exercises of the normal school. It was probably the largest crowd which has ever assembled in that city, many persons being unable to gain admittance to the building. The exercises were begun with music and the usual opening oeremdmes, and after this followed ad­ dresses from a number of the invited guests. State Superintendent Ogden was the first to respond, and he was fol lrwed by President Lord of Mcorhead. Governor-elect Shortrjdge was in attend­ ance and delivered a pleasing address. Mr. Shortridge was followed by Presi­ dent Merrifield of the state university, who spoke briefly and appropriately. President Stockbridge of the state'agri­ cultural college, also responded, as did Mrs. Eisenhuth, the newly elected super­ intendent of publio instruction, Miss Bates of the May ville normal school, J. M. Devine and Messrs. Kinter, Hodgson and Bierly. President Heidel of the board of man­ agement, presented a report of the finances of the institution, imd after a Com. of Attorney General.
