The President begins with charging upon the people of the Northern States the blame of all the disquiet which exists in the entire country because of Slavery, The incessant citation of the Slavery question at the North hae at length, he says, "produced its ma lign influence on the slaves, and inspired them -with vague notions of freedom," and hence there is no feeling of security, in the domestic circle. r fi vc-and-twenty years, he says, "the agitation at the North against Slavery at.the South, has been incessant," State and County Conventions, abilition lec tures and sermons, and speeches in Congress, Lave kept it up without cessation. One who knew no better might suppose, from Mr. Buchanan's remarks, the southern slaves to be the greatest readers of speeches, pamplets, and Helper books that the country can fur nish. "What can a man want to make such a fool of himself for? "What the slaves have heard on tho slavery robject they have heard from their own mas ters, and other southern political railers against "Black Republicans, Anti-slavery men have not been allowed to speak there Is Mr. Buchanan Euch a dunce as not to know that all tho world over, whero chattel slavery prevails, there is fear in tho house, in the field;thatthe "horrors of s errile war' start np in tbo imagination of masters and mistresses, at the rustle of every leaf ? It has always been so, and it always will be so. We give 2Ir. Buchanan nj credit for honesty in his remarks on this subject. Mr. Buchan an re-iterates his former assumptions, that all the oUler dicta of certain Judges of tho Supreme Court arc to bo taken as author lt&tive decisions of the Bench, to be hold as incontrovertible constitutional law by all the people of the United States. Wo belicvoho knows better than that. too. His remarks on the slavery subject, gener ally, are more worthy of such a'shameless pervcrier of the truth as Caleb Cushing than of a President of the United States. The President says in plain terms that there is no right of "seoession," as tho favor ite word is just now, that it is neither more nor less than revolution; that the power of a State to withdraw itself from under the gov ernment of the United States was never re served or given, and does not exist except in the way of revolution. He considers the President, however, to be in a very helpless condition to enforce the laws of Congress in Sonth Carolina. He seems to assume that, as the U. S. Judges and U. S. Marshals in that statc.have resigned, he can take no steps to fill their places or to sustain them if ap pointed, in doing their duty. ilr. B. confounds tho relations of a State, as a State, to the U. S. Government, and the relations of the people of the State to the state. The Stato Legislatures, for instance, appoint U. S. Senators, and if Sauth Caro lina refuses to appoint her Scnators.of course there is no way to make her do it. But then the business of Corner, wonlil in nn wii. out them just as well. When the people of J S. Carolina interfere with the administration of U. S. Law, there is a way to enforce it. and to punish those guilty of interfering with it in S, Carolinr, as well as in Massachusetts or Wisconsin. President Jackson had no difficulty in seeing his way clear in such a case. Neither would Mr. Buchanan have any if he did not wish it. What then does Mr. B. propose to have done in the case? Why, to have an cxplenct. 'ory amendment of the Constitution made, covering three points, which in substance, concede every thing that the ultra slavehold ing politicians of the country ask for.to secu r and erpetuate tbeir power in the nationol government; and by implication to exert itin the free States also. If Mr. Buchanan can have a security for bis life till he sees such an amendment made to the U. S. Consti tution, he will live longer than Methuselah did. In reference to Kansas.Mr. Buchanan goes into a defenco of his Lecompton Constitution policy. Tbc nation understands that subject very well, and all his specious arguments tion will go for nothing with the people. He has not the decencv to recommend the admission of Kansas as a State ; in which we think he shows a mean spite, which is vfry illy atoned for by saying that if Congress can devise any constitutional measure for the relief of tho great suffering there from tho failure of the crops, be shall bo pladtobave it done. On the Buhject of Tariff the President says the Tariff must be modified so as to produce more revenue which is, doubtless correct He also says that the system of ad valorem duties opens the way to inumcrable frauds that a system of sptcific duties, where practi cable, is much preferable on every account. Wo think he is right there, too. Something must be done immediately, he says, to relieve the pret-sing wants of the Treasury. On the whole, the message is a failure, and is so considered throughout the country. 

ATTY. GEN. BLACK'S OPINION. v nf U. S. Attorney General An opinion ot c . J Black on the secession subject is just pub lished. It bears date of Nov. 20, from which it is plain that President Buchanan had it before liini while preparing his message: yet there is nothing in it ( to justify the imbecile position taken by the President. The essential points of this opinion are that no State can absolve its people from their obligation to the laws of tho United States constitutionally enacted ; that it is the duty of the President to see that the laws of the U. S. are enforced, and where the ordinary civil officials arc not suf ficient for that purpose, they must be sup ported by the land and naval forces under his command. A large discretion is left with him as to tho method of procecdure in most cases : il a particular mode is pre scribed by the U. S. law, he must follow it. In regard to the collection of U. S. duties, there is no law which confines him to a par ticular spot it may be any where within a port established by aw and on ship-board if there is any necessity. The protection of the Government property is clearly within the scope of the President's power. The use of the military for all such purposes, must be kept in subordination to the civil power. If civil officers resign, others must be ap pointed in their places. If the laws are not sufficient forthe exigencies of the case. Con gress may make such as will be- If any State should declare her indepen dence of the U. b Government, the President has no power to recognise such action he has no alternative left but to execute the laws, ' 'till a new order of things shall be establish ed by law or force.'' There is nothing in the Constitution to indicate that Congress may make war upon a State ; but "the right of the General Government to preserve itself in its whole constitutional vigor by repelling a direct and positive aggression upon its property and officers, cannot be denied. This is a totally different thing from an offensive war to punish the people for the political deeds of their State Government, or to force an acknowledgement that the Government of the United States is supreme." Mr. Bkck keeps the distinction clear be tween requiring n State, as an organic gov ernment within certain limits, to do this or that, or to omit doing this or that, and the requiring all the people as well of one State as of another to be obedient to the laws of the United States, so far as they are consti tutionally created. Had President Buchan an said. "South Carolina may declare a seces sion if the see.- fit. Declaring her people free to disobey the laws of the L niied States, will not make them free to do so,as they will assuredly find, to their cost whoever of them shall make the attempt. Those who inter fere with the collection of the U. S. duties, the U. S. mails, the administration of U. S. laws through the U. S. Courts and proper official, .r undertake to control the V. S. forts and arsenals, will soon find themselves in conflict with the military and naval forces of the Nation, acting under my orders as Commander-in-chief," -bad lie said this with firmness, and shown himself alert to be ready for any such emergency, the storm of seces sion would s khi die away, as did the nullifi cation storm of 1S33, when Gen. Jackson was in the Executive chair. Evtry day shows that the furious disunion clamor of Iverson, Kcitt, Toombs, ltbett and others of tbut tribe, is &ot fivoretl by the cooler tiortion of the coramunitv in the South. If a rebellion cannot be precipitated, it is not likely to take place at all. " Wait a little while :" " Look before you leap ; is the word from many quarters.

Tbo sword, a despot, and a throne, are the appropriate symbols of what follows. " The North will concede our rights, and the South if we except one 

LETTER FROM CASSIUS M. CLAY. In reply to an invitation to attend a Re publican gathering in Miami county, Ohio, Cassius M. Clay has written a letter declin ing the invitation. After speaking of the importance and value of the victory gained by tho Republicans, Mr. Clay concludes as follows : But we must not flatter ourselves that our work i- done. Only the one great battle has been won. The threats of rebellion and necessary civil war which must attend its actuality, warn us to be on our guard, and call for no holiday patriotism. While we would bear, with a brotherly forbearance, with tho sore disappointment of our late rulers, and give them, patiently, time to accommodate themselves to the new order of things, frankness and a wise philanthropy compel us to say to them at once, that " peaceable secession " is but peaceable re bellion an utter absurdity. Neither one slave State, four slave States, or all the slave States, will be allowed peaceably to secede. Every man of sense sees that civil war would bo better than that eternal war which would be the result of a divided nation. The forces engaged would be less, and the result final. The Union party at the South would be our allies, and with victory, which would be sure for the Union and the right, would come pcacc and a homogeneous empire. But allow secession, and then, with the Southern seced ing States united, would come war inevitably the first time wc met upon the river or the seas, which Mould be settled and renewed from century to century. The South must know that the Republicans intend to allow her all constitutional rights ; and then main tain their own to the last extremity. This is a government of the people, and not a " com pact of States ;" there is no way to dissolve the Union but by rebellion and civil war. It remains for the slaveholders to choose the Union as it is and was, and is to remain, or rush into war with it, and take all the chance- of weal or woe. For us, we have no choice ; we ore hound by all that is sacred among men tj maintain the Government in its supremacy, and our principles upon which it is based. We cannot choose our ground. Destiny places us in the post of uouor. ana pernaps ot danger, and we are cowards if we filter in our duty to our coun try, and the liberties of the people. We must Eiana on tne immortal language of Jackson " The Union, by the Eternal, tt mutt be -ore- served.'" There we must stand, now and henceforth, or be forever slaves. May God inspire our hearts with the cour age and patriotism of '70 ; and may our cause, whether thronzh neace or blood, he eternally triumphant, is the aspiration of wuure iruiy. ij. AI.

There will be but two creat parties in tne country. a Union and a Disunion party, however "it may be named, and with the former, Virgin ia will ally herself. Resignation or Secretart Cobb. Mr. Cobb, having exhausted the U. S. Treasury, run the government heavily in dubt, enzin cored in person the panic in the N.Y. money market, which has already cost the country several uundred millions, and in general done the least possible good and the most possible harm, in bis cfSce, has ot last re signed and gone home, in disgust, it is to be hoped, with himself, and in disgrace with all good men, to plot rebellion in Georgia. If Mr. Cobb had not been Secretary of the Treasury be might still haye been supposed to be an able and honest man. We learn by telegraph as we go to press, that Ex-Gov. Thomas of Maryland, has ris ceived and accepted the Secretaryship of the Treasury in place of Mr. Cobb. Ceittexdek Co. Teachers' Association Potrro.vxijENT. We are requested to state that the meeting of the Chittenden County Teachers' Association, which was to have been held at Richmond, Dec. 25th and 29th, 1860, will be held at the samo place, Jan. 4th and 5th, 1861. Persons interested will please govern themselves accordingly. It-will bo seen by reference to tbo notice of the Executives Committee, that the next an nnal meeting of the Vermont State Temper ance Society will be held at Waterburv, t the 19th and 20th inst. The Raleigh (N. C.) Standard publishes the following stirring appeal: "We hold that North Ccrohna beonos to i. , . .... J -vjuk una not so me politicians thereof. W e hold that the people are sovereign, and can raise up and put d.own who they please. We hold that the government is theirs, as the suffering will be theirs in the event of tr.eir being "precipitated" into disunion and civil war. Our appeal is to them. Their decision shall be iaw to us. But ire protest against manufactured opinion. The disunion leaden art engaged at this time in this very burir.css. In tho language oi the celebrated proclamation of General Jackson, we sy to the people "that eloquent appeals to vojr v-jiiiiiuiic, iu vui taie jiriue, 10 your native courage, and to your sense of real injury,'" are being made to "prepare you for the "pe riod when the mask which conceals the hirio. ous leatures ol disunion shall be taken off."

Gossip aboct the New York Papers. Letter writers at New York are unusually bay, jut now, with rumors about the city journalism. The topics of the day are the apparently expiring condition of The World, and the promised rejuvenation of The News. The latter, now Mayor Wood's special organ, is to be managed by a colony from the Tunes office, taking Mr. Wesley as bnsiness head, Mr. Huribut as oditor-in-ehief, Mr. Wilson, an old stand-by of the Times, and others. The News, even under this "republican" management, will be the democratic organ of the state. It is hinted that the Times iB left rather weak, but no trouble is appre hended. Young Church of the Sun makes rather a poor show, financially, and the pa per, not bein; made to fill the place intended for it, is on the decline. As to The World, it is affirmed (the denial to the contrary notwithstanding) that the editor did write that letter to a southern friend about the paper and all its influence beinir .-inti-T inr.iln and in favor of the South ; Mr. Spaulding, the editor, has just married a southern lady and has a good right to go for tho Union. The World printed 40,000 copies under the one cent system ; it cot a ten cylinder nrpss. raised the piice to two cents, and work off tne edition now with but a very turns of the bit wheel. Fifteen thousand is an onteide calculation of the number printed. The Herald, it is stated, will 6umxrt Lincoln administration ; but Bennett won't get any payioritii lie does. Springfield Rtmtbli can. ih -'rcpablto&a nuMgaatant ," of the News, alluded to' in the paragraph above, won't be "of the straightcst sect," by any means. Mr. Wesley, if we mistake not, has always been a Hard Democrat, and Mr Hurlburt (the inventor of the 'Elbows ofthe ilincio') was never a Republican. We may add that the Times shows no Eigns cf weak ness io its columns. On the contrary with its more pronounced Republicanism, it seems to us to be much stronger (and certainly far better) than it was during the three years or so, when it was steering on a point- n ..-point course.

It was agreed in 1S57 that in no State were collec tions so easy and fnlxa so scarce, as in Vermont, and as it was then, it will be again. As for wool, the Herald will be pained to learn that Vermont is mostly out of that business. A few farmers keep fancy flocks in order to supply the Texas wool growers with S 1000 bucks; but the Dairy and Stock raising has if late years succeed el to wool growing in this State, end while Vermont butter is quick at 20c and Vt. cheese at 10c, in the city markets, our ;farm ers will keep stiff upper Hps, as they jingle tneir money m their trowscrs' pockets.

Vols. 11 and 12. Though we have beforo drawn attention to the superb edition of Lord Bacon's Works, now in process of publication by Messrs. Brown & Taggard, of Boston, we have a present occasion to do it again. The edition in important respects is much superior to any one ever beforo issued. Collected and edited by throe eminent English scholars, James Speeding, Robert Leslie Ellis, and Douglas Dexox Heatii, of Trinity College, Cambridge, the work is enriched by copious notes as well as by translations of some of the Latin Essays, and by papers which have not appeared in former editions. The American Edition has nlso notes by Mr. Spedding, which are not to be found in the English Edition. Wc are informed that it is printed in a more beautiful and convenient form than tho English one. We cannot say how that may be from a personal comparison, the English Edition of which this is mainly reprint, not having fallen under our notice but we can well believe it. It is rare, cer tainly, that more beautiful volumes than these are issued from any press. On a thick fine paper, with that rich creamy tiut which satisfies the oyo completely, in the perfect tvpojrranby of II. 0. IIocchton, of the Riv erside Press, Cambridge, and of Crown 8vo size, wo do not seo how more perfect and de sirable volumes could bo offered to the reader For reasons of convenience, in the order of publication, Messrs. Brown & Taggard be- gan with the eleventh volume of the work It was soon followed by tho twelfth, and wo see by a notico that the next volume is soon to appear. Tho eleventh volume is chiefly oc cupied with Lord Bacon's History of the Reign of Henry VII. Almost every page shows illustrative notes of the'Editor, Mr Spedding. The twelfth volume contains a large number of tho Essays cn Counsels, Civil and Moral. Each volume has an Appendix of interesting and valuable papers. W'e are glad to see, from occasional notices in sundry quarters, that tbo enterprise of the publish ers, in bringing out a work of such standard excellence, is likely to meet with x remuner ating patronage from tho public. We hope their subscription list will be a liberal one in this vicinity. We understand that E. A.

Mr. McCIornand, of Illinois, was unwilling to exense him. Mr. Sieklee, of New York, believed that the power to deal with the pending politio.1 question rests with the Re publican Party, and he desired that the Legisla tures of the Northern States might be convened ia order that they might deal with it.

THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS. SECOND SESSION". "Vashic-ton, Dec. in. In the Senate, the Standing Committees of the last session were continued; Mr. Latham's reso lntion relative to the Overland Mail was referred to the Committee on Post-offices and Post-roads; a memorial from Thaddeac Hyatt, presented bj Mr. Sumner, relative to the suffering people of Kansas, was referred to the Committee on Territo ries; and the Homestead Bill was read the first timo. Mr. Powell, of Kontuck j, then called up his resolution, presented on Thursday, relative to the present oondition of the country, and made a few remarks expressive of his views. Mr. Col lamer of Vermont, made a motion, which was agreed to by Mr. Powell, to strike out everything from the resolution excepting that which referred to Federal afialr, and that it be referred to a spe cial Committee.

FROM WASHINGTON. Despatch to tho N. Y. Times. WasiiissTOS, Dec. 10. A messenger from South Carolina arrived to-day, bringing the vote of that State for President for tho ensuing four years. He delivered the vote and drew the pay for his services. Much surpriso is expressed by those who know this, as the Secession Rep resentatives from that State havo frequently declared that South Carolina was virtually out of tho Union, and would not transmit the vote for President. Some went so far as to say the Electoral Colleges of tho Cotton States would not even meet, and they have refused to vote on certain occasions "in the House on the same ground. The vote trans mitted was for Breckinridge. This act strengthens the belief, men have, that the South docs not actually wish to secede, and is only playing an immense game of bluff. Despatch to the Commercial Advertiser. Washiscto.', Dec. 10. Events have transpired which point to an indefinite postponement of tho secession of South Carolina and other cotton States. They now propose instead of going incon tinently out of our Union to appoint Commis sioners" who shall endeavor to persuade Con gress to consent to an amicable severance of the Union, with a fair division of the federal assets and liabilities. Meanwhile, and until these Commissioners j have effected the object of their mission, tho disaffected states, influenced either by patri otism or prudence, will continue to nay rev enues to the United States government, and enjoy the benefits of the general post office and its operations. The reason assigned for this course is two fold ; First, their ansiety to avoid a collision with tne general government, wnicn tni re flecting men see to be inevitable it eeceMioa is consummated, and for which confessedly no bouthern state is at present prepared. Secondly, that such postponement will give the border stntes an opportunity to reconcile the difficulties between themselves and the cotton states, which they propose to do and must do before they can form a southern confederacy. The latter is the ostensible motive for the proposed delay. Not a few here, however, regard this further and indefinite postpone ment as a virtual admission that whether the cotton states ever seriously meant secession or not, returning reason tells them that it is alike impolitic and impracticable. Vice President Breckinridge has himself attended the caucus of Southern Senators, and strongly advocated an adinstmcnt of all difficulties within the Union and without a resort to secession. Upon the whole the feeling in favor of con- aiation nas made rapid strides since Satur day, and at least the daneer of immediate se cession may be considered as passed. New Mdsic Store.

DESIGNATION OF SlCKsTTAXV CO&B. Secretary Cobb personally tendered his written resignation so-day to the President, though the fact was intimated to him two weeks since. Thursday afternoon he will cave for Georgia, where he will be a Candi da tv for the State Convention which assem bles un the 7th January. lie did net at tend the last three cabinet councils. It seems well credited that Poshnasier General Holt will be transferred to the treas ury, and Mr. King, now first assistant, wHl be made Postmaster General. Mr. Trescott, assistant Secretary of State, returned to-day from South Carolina, and save that there is no deposition to resist any federal law. The State will resist no func tion of the federal government, but by the ordinance of secession will declare no alle giance. This is commented upon here as very novel, and seems to strengthen the fact that secession does not mate civil war inev- taWe. Death aad a Xassow Escaps.

He spoke at some length, proclaiming himseif neither a Democrat nor a Republican, but "an Abolitionist, died in the wool."

The house is situated on the very brink of the mill pond, and ns tho offic ers entered the front door, two of the partici pators in the cheerful exercises of tho even ing made thier esit at the backdoor and start ed for the opposite eide of the pond, each with a jug, which, it is supposed contained something heavy, for tho men had gone but a few rods on the ice when it gave way and they, jugs and all, disappeared.

Daniel Flaheriy, in the employ of Lawrence Barnes & Co., was stabbed in the face Monday eveniDg by Wil liam Hobson, a barber employed in Dwyer's saloon. The parties had been di inking beer with others in Rasiord's saloon, near which the aflair occurred. It is stated that Flaher ty was simply interfering to prevent a diffi culty between Hobson and another man, and gave no provocation for the blow. The cut was a bad gash across the left eye, cutting through the eyelid. It was dressed by Dr. B. W. Carpenter, and though marking him for life, will not permanently injure Flahcr ty's eye-sight though it was a very narrow eeiapefor Irs eye. Hobson was examined beforo Justico J. B.

A correspondent ofthe Caledonian sends a table of weight ofthe members of the legis lature, taken at Montpelier, from which it appears that tho average weightjof the whole number of members, was lC3i lbs. Wash ington County furnished the heaviest men, their average being 173J lbs., and Orleans County the lightest, their average bein" 131 J lbs. Tho average of Chittenden Co., is 152 lbs. It has often been asserted that the men of Vermont, born and raised on tho West sido of tho mountain, were a larger race than those inhabiting the East side, and this ex periment would seem to prove it, theavcraco of tho six counties on this sido being102 2-3 lbs., and of the eight on the other sido bein 15Sj lbs. The number of men weighed is hardly large enough, for a very correct cs t imato however. James MuLVANY,a brakeman on the Rutland Road, was struck on tho head, as the freight train he was on was passing through Pitts- ford bridge last Friday, and so much injured as to causa his death.

The Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer says: It is raid that a bill will bo introduced into the House, on Monday, inquiring into tho action of Mr. Floyd, Secretary of War. It is rumored that ho has sont pencil- erable quantities of arms to tho Southern arsenals, without Eending troops to protect the arms so stored. In the event of the se cession of the South, these would at once fall an easy prey. Some time ago an act was passed, which authorized the replacing of arms used in the Mexican war by those of an improved man ufacture.
