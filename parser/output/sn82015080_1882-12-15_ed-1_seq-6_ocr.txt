CHINA. JAPAN ANI EGTPT. In the interest of justice toward China and Japan I trust that the question of tha return or the Indemnity fuml to tne liovernments or thort countries will ictc-h at the present ses sion the sitlifactory solution which 1 hare already recommend -H ana which has recently lecn foreshadowed by Congressional discus sion, and the treatv lxttly conclcded with C'orca awaits the action of the Senate. During the late disturbances in Egypt, the timely presence of American vessels served as u protection to the pr.-oiis and iropcrtyof tnany of our own citizens and of citizens of other count! ica, whose Governments hive ex pressed their thanks for this ssltance. The recent legislation restricting the imml frrat on of lattorers from China has Riven rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own. In construing- this act of Msy tl, lKj, In connection with the treaty of November 7, 1SS), the restriction would seem to b' limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States ai laborers, and should not forbid a mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject for action, if any mav be deemed advisable.

It was made apparent in the course of the animated disscussions which this question aroused at the last session of Congress that the iKdlcy of diminishing the revenue by re ducing taxation, commanded the general ap proval of the members of both houses. I regret that because of conflicting views as to the tost methods by which that policy should be made operative, none of its benefits have as vet been reached. In the fulfillment of w hat I deem mv coustitution.il duty, but with little hope that I can make a valuable contri bution to this vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to il Upon the rhowing of our financial condi tion at the close ot the last fiscal year I felt Justified in recommending to Congress the abolition of internal revenue taxes, except those upon tobacco in its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, except also the special tax upon the manufac tures and dealers in such articles, I venture now to suggest that unless it shall to ascer tained that the probable expenditures of the Government for the coming year have been underestimated all internal taxes save those w hich relate to destillcd spirits can be prudent ly, abrogated. such a course ll accompanied Dy a simplifica tion of the machinery of collection which would then to eay of accomplithineut, might to reasonably expected to result in the di minishing of the cost of such collection by at least $i,500,0J0, and in the retirement fiom oflh-e of from 1.50J to 2,000 persons. 'Ihe sys tem of exc sc duties l as never commcuded it- fdl to the favor of the American people, and has never been resorted to, excent for supply ing deficiencies in the treasury w hen by icjson ot iecial exigencies the duties on imports have proved inadequate lor the needs oi the Governincut. 'Ihe sent ment of the country doubtless commands that the pi cseut excise shall to abolished as soon as such a course cau safely to pursued. It seems to nic, how ever, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes woul 1 for the present to an unwise step. Two of these reasons are deserving of especial mention. First It Is by no means clear that even If the existing system of duties on imports are contiuued without inod.tL-ations. those duties alone will yield eutlicient rev enue for all the needs of the Gov ernment, It is est. mated 1U0. 000.000 will to required for pensions during the coming year, and it may well to doubtod whether the maximum annual demand for that object has yet tocn reached. Uncertainty uion this question woulil alone justify, In my Judgment, tno retention lor the present of that ortlon of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. Second A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove a serious, if not an insurmountable object to a thorough re vbion of tLc tariff and to any cons deraidc re duction in inijort duties. The present tanlf system is in many resects unjust. It makes unequal distribution", I otb of its burdens and and Its benefits. This fact was practically recognized by a majority of each house of Congress In the passage of the act creating the tarlll commission. The report of that commission w ill to placed tolore you at the beginnngof this session, and will, I tru?t. aiiordyou such information as to the condi tion and prospect of the various commercial. agricultural, manufacturing, mining and other interests of the country, and contain such suggestions for statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this Impor tant sui'ject, i he revenue from customs for the fiscal year ending June 3J, lbT'J, amounted to 1U0, l&MXX). It has in the thice succeeding years leached 1S),00J,00J, then $19?,0)0,xA), and finally, as has toen already stated. $2:0.( 0 .- OX). The increase from this sourcs for th fiscal year which will end on June 30, lfvvi. will doubtless have been considerably in ex cess of the sum last mentioned. If "the tax on domestic spirits is to to retained, it is plain, therefore, that large t eductions from the cuftoms revenue are entirely feasible. While? lecommer.din&r this reduction 1 am far from udviMni the abandonment of the nolicv of so discriminating in tl.e adjustment of duties to a. lord cid and prote tion to domes tic iarxr, out tne present system should re so revised as to eiualic the public burden among all clas.-es and occupations, and brm,r It into closer harmony with the present needs of industry w.thout entering into minute de- taia w n.ch, under the piesent cirum.-t.mces, is quite unncccssa v. 1 le ommecd a?i en- la- iremcnt of the free llt so as to imlude within it the numerous art cles which v;eld an inconsl e able revenue; a simplification of the complex, inconsistent sched de of duties ujx.il certain mauufact ic , particularly those o cotton. 1. ou an t steel, and a substuniil ia. duct Ion of the duties upo:i tho.-e article, and upon sugar, mouses, s.lk. wool an I woo en good, if a general rev tion of the tariff sh dl to found to be impra -tl ab c at this ses- s on. 1 express the hoie th t at least some of tue more consp:cuous iniquities oT the pre cut law may to corrected to.'o c vour final ail. joaintr.e it. One of tuem is specially ie erred to by the Secretary in view ot a recent deci sion of thc-Supr me Court. The nccc?si:y of auicndinz thclaw bv which th dut.es stand ard or color is adopted as the test o the i a chaiine strength of sugars is too obvious to require comment. 

CONDITIOX OP THE ARMT. From the report of ths jec.-eUry of War it appears that the only outbreak oi ti e Indians dnilng the pas, year occur. c 1 in Ariz na and in the southwestern pa. t of Ne Mex co. These were promptly quelled, and the quiet which has pie veiled in all other rurts of the country has permitted suc.i an additi n to be ma le to the mil tary force in the icgion en dange cd by tl.e Apaches, that the e is little rxMMn to apprelcnd troublo In the future. Those parts of the Secretary's repoits which relate to our sea coast defence and their armraent sugzest the gravest ques ions. Our exis nz fortlucations aie notoriously Inade-' qute to the defense of the creat barbers and cit cs for whose protection they wee built, Thequcono prjv.d ng an armament suit ed to our present necessities has toe-i the suVject of corsUIerat oi by a board whose re port was trausmittcd to Congress at the last session. I invite tho attention of Congress to the propriety of making more adequate provisions for arming and e ,uipp ng the m litis than is aflo.dcd by the act of lu, whi h is still upon the statute book. The matter has already n V.'f. gube 1 fd-cus.on In the Senare, and a Mil widen seeks to supply the deficicn- ie of the existing laws ia now upon its cal endar. The f ecreUry of War calls attention to the fact that there Is an emban assment growing out of the iccent act of Congress, making the iiuinuruiui ou.cerso. me army compulsory at "t rc.V4 nij-iuur. ine act or 137a 19 mil iu lorce. wn.cn limit t a.w number of those bo can to retired or d s ab.hty or upon their own application.

There are now It l not l.kely that Congress intended this re sult, and 1 concur with the SecreUry that the law ought to be amended- 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. The grounds that impelled me to withhold ray slguature Irom an act entitled "an act making arrroiriationa for th construction, repair and preservation of certain works on riven, and hart or," which tocame a law near the close ot your last session, prompt me to exf,rvVb0 P3 tn1 na similar measure will bedeenudneceaary daring the present session of Congress; indeed, such measure would now be open to a serious obJectif.n ia addition to that which was urged upon your atten ion by the Secretary of War, thai the quarter portion of the sum appropriated for tiie various items speeifiei in that act remain unexpended. Of the new works which it au thorized, expenses have been incurred upon two onl', for which the total appropriation was $-10,000. It is apparent by this exhibit that, so far as concerns most ot the items to wxiich. the act of August 2, 1SS2, relates, there can be no need of further appropriations until after the close of the present session. If, however, any action should seem to be necessary in respect to particular objects, it will be entirely leasa ble to provide for those objects by appropriate legislation. It is probable, for example, that a delay until the assembling of the next Con gress to make additional provision for the Mississippi river improvements might to at tended with serious consequences. If such should to be the case a just bill relating to that subject would command my approval. This leads me to offer a suggestion, which I trust will commend itself to the wisdom of Congress. It is not advisable that grants of consider able sums of money for diverse and inde pendent schemes of internal improvement, should be made the subject of separate and d.stinct legislative enactments. It w ill scarce ly to gaiusaid even by those who lavor the most liberal expenditures for such purposes as are sought to be accomplished by what is c mmonly called the River and Harbor BUL that the practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for a great diversity of objects widely sej ara ei, either in their nature, iu the loca-ity which they are concerned, or ia both, is one wh ch. is much to be deprecated unless it is irremediable, it inevitably tends to secure the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if separately considered, could scarcely lail of rejection by the adoption of the course I have recommended. Every member of Congress, when any opportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations would be enabled so to do without being called upon to sauction others undeserving of his approval. So also would the Executive be afforded there by a full opportunity to exercise his constitu tional prerogative of opposing whatever ap propriations seemed to him objectionably without impelling the success of others which commended themselves to his judg ment It may be urged, in opposition to these suggestions, that the number of works of internal improvement which are justly en titled to Government aid, is so great is to render impracticable separate appropriation bills, or even for such a comparatively limited number as make the disposition of large sums of money. Tiiis objection may be well founded, and whether it be or not, the advantages which would be likely to ensue from the adoption of the course 1 have recommended mav, perhaps, be more effectually attained by auother, which I respect. ully submit to Congress as an alter native proposition. It is provided by tha constitutions of foxir tcen of our States that the Executive may dis approve an item or items of a bill appropriat ing money, whereupou the part of the bill ap proved shall be law and the part disapproved shall fail to become a law, unless repassed ac cording to the provisions prescribed lor the Iiassage of bills over the veto of the Executive, i submit to your careful consideration the question whether an amendment of the Federal Constitution, in the particular indi cated, would not aflord the best remedy for what is often a grave embarrassment both to membe. s of Congress and to the Executive and is sometimes a serious public mischief. TUB 

NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Navy states the movements ot the various squadrons during the year in home and foreign waters where our otikers and seamen wiih 6Uch ships as we to8ess, haye continued to illustrate the high character and excellent discipline of the naval organization. The rresident here calls attention to the cruif e and loss ot the Jeannettc aud a portion of her crew in the an tic regions. It appears by tue Secretary's report that the available naval force of the united States con sists of thirty-seven cruisers, fourteen single turreted monitors built duiing the rebel! ou, a la ge number of smooth-bore guns and Par rott rifles, and eighty-sevcnritled cannon. The cruising vessels should to gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern a; mored vessels, and the armament by high pow end rii.ed guns. The reconstruction of our navy, wh ch was recommended in my last messjge: was begun by Congress, authorizing in its recent act, the construction of two large inarmored steel vessels of the character recommended by the late Navy Advisory Board, and subject to the fi.ial approval of a new advisory board to be organized as provide I by that act. I call your attention to the lecom mendation of the Secretary and the board, that authority to be ffiven to construct two more cruisers of smaller dimensions, and one fleet o: dispatch vessels and that appropriations be made for higii power ri.led cmno 1 for the torpedo service and for ot -er harbor defences. Fend ng the consideration b Congiess of the olicy to be hereafter adopted in conduct ing the eight large navy yards and their ex penshe establishment, the Secretary advo cated the reduction of cx'euditurcs to the lowest po6sil)le an ounts. For the purpose of affo;diug the officers and seamen of the navv opportunities of exercise and iscipl ne in their profession under the appropriate cont ol and d lection, the Secretary advises that the lighthouse service and coast survey be trans ferred, as now organi ed, from the treasury to t!ie Navy Department, and he also suggests, for the reasons which he assigns, th;it a s ra ilar transfer may wisely be made of the cruis ing revenue vessels. The Secretary forcibly depicts the intimate connection andT inte: -dependence of the navy and tue commercial marine, and attracts at tention to the coutinued decadence of the lat ter aim me corresjonuing trans er or our growing commence to :oieign latteries. This subject is one of tue utmost importance to the national welfare. Methods ot reviving Amer ican ship-bu lding, of restorin? the United States Hag in the o e in carrying trade, should receive tlie immul ate attention of Congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant ma terial for the manufacture of modern iron steamshirs in fair competition with our com mercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor and In rating them higher, taxes and the creater Interest on capital, while the o ean hichwnys are already monopolized by our formidable compet tors. These obstacles should in some way be over come, and for our rapid communication with foreign lans, we shonli not continue to de pend wi.ollv ujon ves:els built in the yards of other countries and sailing under lore'gn flags. With no United States 6teamers on the principal ocean lire for any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted, while the nations which build an 1 sail the ships and crry the mails and pasensrer8 obtain thereby conspicuous advantages for inc: easing thelr'trade. , TOE POSTOrriCE 

DEPAHTMEFT. ' The report of th? Postmaster General gives evidence cf the satisfactory condition of that department, and contains many valuable data and accompanying suggestions, which cannot fail to be of Interest. 1 he informar.io 1 whit h it affords that th? receipts for the fiscal year have exceeded the expenditures must be very I gratlf vine to Congiess and t' ths people of the country. As matters which may fairly c aim particular attention, I re'.er you to h.s obser alion in reference to the advisability of chaneiutr the present basis for fixing salaries and allowances, of extending th; money order system, of enla-ging tl e finances of the Tostal establishments to be under its control. the telegrai h s stem of the co antry. though from thia list and mot Important recommen dat.on I must withhold my concurrence. J or any of them would alio, d an adequate rem At the bst session of Congiess several bills i edy lor the evils which they aim?d to correct. were introduced into the Ho ise of Represen tatives tor tue reduction or letter postage to the rate of two cents per half ounce 1 have given much study and reflection to this, and am thorouch'y convinced that sneh action would be for the best Interests of the public It has been the olicv of the Government from Its foundation to defray, as far as pos sible, the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of a postage, it has never b e 1 claimed, however, that this service ought to be p odnctive of a net revenue. Aa has been stated already, the report of the Post master General shows that there is now a vny consideiatle su plus in his department, and crease at a much giater ratio than the ex- tnat nenceiorta tne recerpts are ix iyw in- penditures. unlet some change is mace in the existing laws, th proata of the Postal ser- vice will, iu a very few years, swell the rev- enue ol the Government many milliors of dollars. The time seems auspicious for some wv0? In, nxe ot Postage. In what shall that reduction consist! A review of the legislation which baa been had upon thia sub ject during the last thirty years discloses that domestic letters constitute the only class ot mail matter which has never beeu favored by a substantial reduction of rates. I am con vinced that the burden of malntalnicg the service falls most unequally upon that class, and that, more than any other, it is entitled to the present relief, that such relief may be ex tended without hurt to other public interests, will be discovered upon reviewing the results of former reductions. Here follows a review of former rates of postage. If Congress should approve these sugges tions, it may be deemed desirable to supply to some extent the deficiency which must for a time result by increasing the charge for carry ing merchandise, which is now only sixteen cents per pound. But even without such an increase I am confident that the receipts under the diminished rates would equal the expend itures after the lapse of three or four years. 

DEPARTMENT OF JC8TICE. The report of the Department of Justice brings anew to your notice the recess ty of enlarging the present system of Federal juris prudence so as effectually to answer the re quirements of the ever increasing litigation with which it is called upon to deal. The Attorney-General reuews the suggestions of his predecessor that in the interests of Justice better provision than the existing laws afford should be made in certain judicial districts for fixing the lees of witnesses and jurors. In my message of December last, I referred to the pending criminal proceedings growing out of the alleged frauds in what is known as the Star Route serv ce of the Postotiice Depart ment, and advised you that I had enjoined upon the Attorney General and associate counsel, to whom the interests of the Govern ment w ere intrusted, the duty of prosecuting w ith the utmost vigor of the "law, all persons who might be found chargeable with thoe offences. A trial of one of these cases has since occurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the Supreme Court of this District, and was conducted with great real aud ability.. It resulted in a disa greement of the jury, but the cause has been again placed upon the calendar and wi:l 6hoi t lv be retried. If any guilty persons shall finally escape pun'ehment for their offenses, it will not be for tha lack of diligent and earn est effort8 on the part of the prosecution. I trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily enable Congress with the concurrence of the Executive to afford the commercial community the benefits of a na tional bankrupt law. THE 

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with its accompanying documents, presents a full s'atenient of the varied operatious of that department. In respect to Indian affairs nothing has occurred which has changed or serious ly modified the views to which I devoted much space in a former com munication to Congress. I renew the recom mendations therein contained as to extending to the Iudian the protection of the law; al lotting land in severalty to such as desire it and making- suitable provision for the educa tion of youth. Such a provision as the Secre tary forcibly maintains will prove unavailing unless it is broad e:iough to include all those who are able and willing to make use of it, and should not 6olely relate to intellectual training, but also to instruction in such man ual labor aud simple industrial arts as can be made practically available. RAILROADS. Among other importaut subjects which are included within the Secretary's rej)ort, and w hich will doubtless furnish occasion for Con gressional action, may be mentioned the ne glect of the railroad companies to which large grants were made by the acts of 1SG2 and 1S:H, to take a title thereto and their consequent inequitable exe option from local taxation. One of the incidents of the marvelous exten sion of the railway system of the country has been the adoption of such measures by the corporations which own or control the roads as has tended to impair the advantages of healthful competition, and made hu'-tiul dis criminations in the advancement of freights. These inequalities have been corrected in seve ral of the States by appropriate legislation, the effect of which is necessarily restricted to the limits of their own territories. POLYGAMY THE TERRITORIES. The results which have thus far attended the en'orcemeut of the recent statute lor the sui prcssion of polygamy in the territories, are reported by the Secretary of the Interior. It is not probable that any additional legislation in this regard will be deemed desirable until the effect' of the existing laws shall be more clearly observe I and studied. 1 congratulate you that the Commissioners, under whose supervision these laws have been put in operation, are encourased to believe that the evil to which they are aiming may be suppressed without resort to such ladival measures as in some quarters have been thought indlspensibie :or success. The c'ose relations of the General Govern ment to the Territories p eparing to be great States may well engage your special atten tion. It is there that the 'Indian disturbances mainly occur, and that polygamy has found room for its growth. I cannot doubt, that a i areful survey of territorial legislation would be of the hiahest utility. Life and property ! would become more secure, ihe liability of outbreaks between Indians and whites would be lesseued, the public domain would be more securely guarde l, and totter progress would be made in the inst.uction of the voung. Alaska is still without any form of civil government. If means were provided for the education of Its people, and for the protection of their lives and property, the immense re sources of that region w ould invite permanent se Elements and open new fields for industry and enterprise. DEPARTMENT OF A.GRICTL.TURE. The report of the Commissioner of Agricul ture presents an account of the labors of that department duiing the past year, and includes information of much in terest to the general public The condi tion of the forests of the country and the wasteful manner in wh'ch their destruction is taking pace give cause for grievous app e hension. Their action in protecting the earth's surface, in modifying the extreiies of climate and regulating aud sustaining the flow of springs and streams is not weflr understood, andti.cir importance in relation to the growth aud pros erity 01 the country cannot be safely disregarded. They are fast disappearing tolore destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our Increasing population, and their total extinction cannot be long de layed unless better methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their protection and culti vation. The attention of Congress is invited to the necess ty of alditional legislation to secure tlie preservation of valuable torests still remaining on the pub'ic domain, especially in the extreme western States and Territories, where the necessity for their preserv tion is greater than in less mountaueous regions, and where the prevailing dimness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are once de stroyed, well nigh impossible. MISCELLANEOUS. The communication which I made to Con gress at its first session in De ember last con taineJ a somewhat full statement of my senti- ments in relation to the principles and rules which ought to govern appointments to the public service. In referring to the various plans which had therefor ten the subject of discussion in the National Legislature plans which in the main were modeled upon the sys tem which obtains in Great Britain, but which lacked certain of the promnent leatures whereby that system is distinguished, I felt ! bound to intimate my thoughts, whether they I declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed measures should prove acceptable to Conrress they would receive the unhesitating support of the Executive, Since th- suggest io:is were submit ed for your consider t ion, there has been no legislation upon the subject to which they relate, but there baa meanwh le been an increase in the public interest upon that sub ject, and the people of the country, appar ently wit! ut distinction of party, have In various ways, and upon frequent occasions, g.ven expression to iheir enrnest wish for prompt and definite action. In my judgment euch action should no longer be postponed. T miT add that mv own sense of its p essinr importance has been qui. ke-iel by obsenra- - ton in the practical phase f the latter, to wticn attention na more wu r calle b my predecessors. The civil list now comprises about 100,000 persons, the larger pait ox whom must, uufler the terms nf ihm rvnt? the President, cither directly or through his appointees. In the early years of the admln lstraUon of Government, the personal direc- uu ui appointments to tne civil ser vice maV nnt hav lun mn tt-t-r.X nV to .the Executive, but . now that the uuruen nas . increased fully a hundredfold, it has become greater than he ought to bear, and it necessarily distracts his time and at tention from the proper discharge of other duties no less delicate and responsible, and which, iu the very nature of things, cannot be delegated to other hands. In the judgment of not a few, who have given study and rejec tion to this matter, the nation has outgrown the provision which the Constitution has established for filling the minor offices in the public service; but what ever may be thought of the wisdom or expedi ency of changing the fundamental law in this regard, it is certain muh relief mav be af forded, not only to the President and to the heads of the departments, but to Senators and Representative in Congress. By discreet legislation they would be protected in a great measure by the bill now pending be ore the Senate, or by any other which should embody Its important features from the pressure of personal importunity and from, the labor of examing coatiicting claims and pretensions of candidates. I trust before the close of the present ses sion some decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils which is in the present methods of appointments, and I as sure you of my hearty co-operation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of subordinate em ployes of the Government, it 6eems to be gen erally agreed that whatever their extent or character, the one should be definite, and the ottier stable, and that neither should be regu lated bv zeal in the service of party, or fidelity, in the fortunes of an individual. It matters little to the people at large what com- Bjtent person is at the head of this epartraent or of that Bureau, if they feel that the removal of one and the accession of an other will uot involve the retirement of honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are purely administrative, and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the success of any political party or faction. It is to this latter'class of officers that the Senate bill, to which I have already re erred, exclusively applies, while neither that bill nor any other prudent scheme for improving the civil service concerns the higher grade of ollicials who were appointed by the Pres.dcnt and confirmed by the Senate. A 

MISAPPREHENSION CORRECTED. I feel bound to correct a prevalent misap prehension as to the frequency with which the present Executive has displaced the in cumbent of an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeatedly alleged that he has in this particular signaily departed from the course which has beeu pursued under the recent administrations of the Govern ment. (Here follows a comparison of removals and appointments under the administration of Mr. Hayes. 

POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS. I declare my approval of such legislation as may be necessary for supplementing the ex isting provisions of the Ibw in relation to po litical assessments. In July last I authorized a public announcement that employes of the Government should regard themselves as at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action iu that regard would in no manner affect their official 6tatus. In this an nouncement I acted upon the view which I had always maintained, and still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a contribution for the a;d of the jk) itical party of his choice It has, however, been urged, and doubtless not without found it on in lact, that by the solicitation of superiors and by other modes such contributions have at times toen obtained from persons whose only motive for giving, has been a fear of what might befall them if they refused to give. Without sayiug that 6uch contributions are not voluntary and in my judgment their collection should to prohib ted by law, a bill which will effectively suppress them will re ceive my cordial approval. . - TIIE SUCCESSION. Among the question which have been the topic of iccent debate In the halls of Conrres, none are of greater gravity than those reUting to the ascertainment of "the vote for Presi dential electors and the intendment of the Constitution in its provision for devolving executive functions upou the Vice President, when the President suffers from inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office. I trust that 1:0 embarrassment may result from & failure to determine the questions before another natlo.isl election. 

FINALE. The closing year has been replete with bless ings, for which we owe the Giver of All Good our reverent acknow ledgment, For the unin terrupted harmony of our foreign relations, lor the decay of sectional animosities, for the exuberauce of our harvests and the triumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the prevalence of health, . the spread of Intelligence and the conservatives of the public credit for the growth of the couutry in all elements of national greatness; ior these and countless other blessintrs, we should rejoice and be gl;d. I trust that in and under the inspirat on of this great pros I etity our councils may be harmonious and that the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice and economy may be the adoption of measures in which the Congress aud the Ex ecutive may heartily uni e. C'HE-TER A. ARTHUR. Washington, D. C, Dec. 4, 1882. "Soap-Babble Parties. ' Soap-bubbles are as old as the rock ribbed Palisades, as familiar as dayshine. Fashion is at present turning them to ac count, causing them to prove a source of mirth and enjoyment, not to the deni zens of the nursery, but to the young ladies of the drawing-room. Yea, the rosebuds of the bouquet of society have, under the nod, beck and wreathed smile of fashion, turned soap-bubbles to ac count, and have placed them among the glittering nothings that constitute the amusements of the blase upper ten. At a recent "at home" the guests became aweary, all the usual topics had been talked out, carpet dancing was voted a bore and rounri games idiotic. . A happy thought suddenly struck the hostess, and all eyes were opened in wonder when a large china punch-bowl filled with soap suds was placed upon the center-table of the drawing-room, the carpet having been prudently screened with linen, os tensibly for greater conveniences in dancing. "Long nine" eighteen clay pipes were produced, and alftried to see who' could blow the biggest bubble. Three trials were granted' each person, but all whose bubbles burst were com pelled to desist from the "blow." There were five judges to estimate the size of the bubbles and to award the prizes, which were old Knickerbocker pipes, plaques and other dainty souvenirs, to the successful blowers. The fun was im mense as the rosy lips and perfumed mustaches tried their skill upon the "long nines." Sir Philip Haughton Clarke, Baro-P net, who sailed from New York to Eng land, has purchased 27,000 acres of land in Florida for a large English agricultural company. The same syndicate has bee;i given the refusal of 87,000 more acres, which, when cleared, will be converted into orange groves. A black-snake attempted to despoil s bee-hive in Berkeley County, Virginia, a few days ago. and the bees attacked and stung the reptile to death. m m .
