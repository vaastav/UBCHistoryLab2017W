"We print on our first page, to-day, the President's Message, entire, to the exclusion of much of our general variety of news and . miscellaneous reading matter., It is a docu ment which will encourage the hearts and etrengthen the faith of the business interests and" real friends of the ""country in all rela tions. t In its whole spirit and . tone it is ad miratle ; or in other words it is conciliatory and fair, yet at the same time it is firm and ' free from the defient temper which some have" supposed Mr. Johxson would indulge inl As a Stato paper, its author has breath ed into it his own calm, well-considered, earn est," a.nd statesman-like sympathy and wis dom. .While some may find in Itsome'thing3 they cannot approve, there is solid ground on which all friends of the Federal Consti tution,' and States Rights, may stand and support the President. He supports the views, taken in his Message of 1865, of the relations of the States to the Union, and States Rights, and re-stated in .this, power fully ,by warnings and arguments from "Wash ington, Jefferson and Jackson. We ask for it a carefal perusal by all our patrons. After the President, in the outstart of his Message, has" established the fact that the Southern , States had been recognized as States, both by the Executive and Legisla tive branches of the Government, the Pres idenf re-affinn3 hbold views and opinions as to their right of representation, and the du ty of Congress to accord them that right at the earliest possible moment. lie bases their right to representation upon tho "great principle enunciated . in the Declaration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation, and ydt be denied the right of representation ;" upon the express provision of the Constitu tion tbat'each State shall have at least one Representative," and "that no State, with out its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suSrage in the Senate." These are points which cannot bo shaken, either by law or logic As to the policy of the course recom mended by the President,' it reste' upon a sincere belief .that tie admission of re pre sentativesfrom the late revoltedStates would accomplish much towards the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, arid remove serious cause for discontent and complaint on the part of the inhabitants o; the rejected and repudiated States. "The position of the President upon this question of reconstruction and representa tion will be eminently satisfactory to the true frieuds of republican -liberty in the nation. It is in full harmony with the theory of our government and the teachings of the men who framed it, and alio has the sanction of a "succession of acts and declarations from the very party which is now agitatin:? in fa vor-of consohdation and despotism. The linefonncrly drawn by the President between himself and the Radical party upon this vital issue .has been again marked out with unmis takable distinctness, and the contest is now, State right3 and constitutional representa tion, on the one hand; and on the other, . Congressional usurpation and national con solidation. The battle upon those issues will now be opened in Congress. .The New York Day-Book- tThis paper is favorably known by the De mocracy of Pennsylvania as well as through the pther States in this Union. - Its Dsmoc racy never was questioned, even by the most suspicious, and in every campaign it took an active and prominent part. A more straight forward course was not pursued by any paper . during the past five yearsT We have read its editorials with a great deal of interest and care, 3and can safely recommend the paper to all our friends as an able exponent of true D2mocratic principles as laid down by Thom as J efferson and other good old patriots of hi s day.. During the whole four years of war, this paper maintained a consistent opposi ' tfon to that unnatural strife, which position the true Democrats heartily endorsed. The. Democratic party never can gain anything for themselves as a party or for the good of the country by acknowledging the war just This paper never admitted any part of the war to be right, but was opposed to it in every - conceivable shape, and treated it as entirely wrong. . , - ' .

Basing their arguments entirely upon the ground of policy, they seem to forget that the "Democratic party is founded upon the immutable basis of devotion "to principle, and cannot sacrifice its convictions of right Chagrined at the success of the Radicals, in the late elections, they wish to adopt the tactics of the enemy, hoping thereby to at tain the same triumph. Never was there a greater mistake. Never was there a more fatal cause, and the great masses of the Dem ocratic party, who will not abate one jot of their regard for Constitutional rights, and who indignantly repudiate any compromise of principle, will sternly rebuke the coward ly course of those journals in deserting the ancient faith and going after strange gods. The Democratic party ia a necessity of our form of government. It originated as a le gitimate consequence from the spirit of our institutions. It is the conservator of our liberties, and the guarantor of our constitu tional rights. Its instinct with principle, is as immutable as principle, and will neither pass away nor abandon its high and holy mission until the Republic is gone, and an other form of policy established upon the ruins of the commonwealth. In the name of the great Democratic party of the country we indignantly rebnke the course f these journals above named in recommending the adoption of the Constitutional amendment, and protest against their betrayal of the old faith, their cowardly desertion of their po- itical brethren, who have fought the good fight so sternly, steadily and uncompromis ingly. .... The 'Constitutional Amendment" is a violation of the letter and spirit cf the Con stitution. It is contrary to the forms of the pact which writes us one nation. It estab- Ishes a condition precedent to the admission of the Southern Representatives, which is utterly subversive of the equality of the States. . It makes of Congressa gigantic and remorseless consolidated aristocracy, chang mg our form of government at one tremen dous blow. It denies the fundamental ax iom of the Declaration " of Independence that all governments derive their just pow ers from the consent of the governed. It is a monstrous tcroiig, a . fit sequence "to the aristocratic teachings of Federalism, and unworthy is any freeman who endor es it, to enjoy the benefits of constitutional liberty, It seeks to plant,' at one effort, upon the broad basis of political asd social equality, a.1 ' Jl .. . 1 .1 l . rr m negro race wun tne wmtes. lhis can not be done. No mere human legislation, no tyranical ukase, no despot's command or minion's slavish obedience, can alter the immutable work of the Lord GodAlmighty. Between the negro and the white there is a gulf eo deep and broad, dug by the hands of God Himself, that no human effort can bridge no human legislation fill up. Upon its lace .the Constitutional Amendment, seeks to violate to disrupt, to destroy, : the sacred provisions of the Constitution and to alter the work of the Living God Himself. Of necessity it ' cannot succeed. It must not, it should not ' It is contrary to every line of our political teaching to every iota of our political tradition to every tenet of our political faith. The great Democratic party of the country are sternly resolved not to allow such an infamous wrong to be even temporarily or partially successful, and the Chicago Tbnet, the Albany Argus, the Bos ton Post, which are followed by the Wash ington Star, will meet, are meeting, with the unanimous and thorouehly indignant re buke of the Democratic party. A New Book by Mrs. Eiita D. E. N. Southwortit. T. B, Peterson & Brothers, Philadelphia-, have in press and will publish on Saturday, December 15th, a new book by Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth, enti tled "The Bride of Llewellyn," which will, beyond all doubt, proves to be the most pop ular and successful work that ha3 ever been written by her, for she is beyond all question the most powerful female writer in America, if not in the world. No one ever read a chapter of one of her works, without wish ing to reacT the whole'book, and none ever read one of her books without admiring the rare genius of its author, and wishin? that she might soon write another. Her scenes are life-pictures, her incidents are" founded on facts, and her sentiments are character ized by a singular purity both of conception and expression, bhe has the rare faculty of saying what she means, and of saying it msucn a manner that her. meaning can not be misinterpreted. In short, she pos sesses in an eminent degree those qualiSca tions which are the peculiar prerogatives of a good writer, and while she delights the reader's imagination with her descriptive beauty, see npplieshome truths to his under standing with the force of rational convic tion. . The "Bride of Llewellvn" will welcomed by all such readers especially ; and those who have never read the worksof this gifted woman fchoiild not fail . to buy and read this new novel by this gifted American authoress.

He was favorably spoken- of for Governor,, at different times. -A'laofi kesesi ciari, than Jacob Fet was, doe3 nctr livs. -' ' r Extract from a Be rmo n. ; .Th9 following is" an "extract from'the ser mon preached by Rev. John Chambers, of Philadelphia, on last Thanksgiving day.! He ia eloquent, logical and argumentive. Reatf the extract : " ' As I have already intimated, brethren, wo have met for the purpose of thanksgiving ; and, as I have already said, that there- are innumerable causes of gratitude to God, is known to you just as well as it is to me, and that there is no particular period, as I have already intimated, when -we are to pay par ticular grrtitude, 1 know not, . unless it is "when we receive an exuberance of favors from our Divine Father. Gratitude is one of the highest gifts of our nature. The grateful man is always an honorable man. A non-grateful man, and what we usually deem an ungrateful man, is a mean creature. You cannot feci for him as the heart feels for the grateful man. In the ordinary walks and business of life this is bo throughout every age. The gentlemen before me, and these ladies, that are familiar with the duties and intercourse of the social relations of life have observed it The grateful person you cannot forcet, and you cannot help respecting him, because in one who possesses gratitude there is honor in that heart there is principle there ; but tha ungrateful man is always an object of contempt and disgust. You may pity him, and you cannot help pitying him and having compassion for him. At the same time, his ingratitude you talk about as base. For the ingrate, "I did so and so, and conferred this favor and that, and now see how he has treated mc;" andj-ou look at his ingrati tude, and it naturally excites in the mind feelings of disgust for that man or that woman: ' Speaingof the ingratitude of the pres ent day. in order to prevent the spread of it, he said the pulpit should pour out an un broken storm of life, peace and of charity, and that the public press, instead of being filled with bitterness and vengeance and wrath, and trying to inflame the passions and arraying men in bloody hatred against one another should be constrained to adopt a a different course, and if they continue in this should be. banished from every hearth stone in the land. They should pursue the divinely appointed course. What we want now in this land is peace. , We are an un happy people. There is an amount of unhappines3 in this land that is unknown to any one but God himself. ' The question which I propose to you is whether, as a nation of people, we ought not to-day to be mourning ? We have met for the purpose of thanksgiving and to be grateful to God. I say it i3 a question whether this nation should be clothed in the garments of mourning or garments of praise. and I believe in the latter. We have not reached that point yet There is a vast dea to be done. ; There is a great deal of hatred and enmity and of evil feelings in this land that must be taken away. - Wc must have all these clashing, dashing roaring madmen, who are endeavoring to inflame the passions of the people, comfort ed, and clothed and in their right niiud, and have them to learn the doctrines of right eousness. Look at the condition of the country at the present day.- Thousands and tens of thousands of the people have scarce ly any bread to eat Iu one single region of the State of Alabama, I am told by one of tho most intelligent men, there are seven thousand five hundred men and women, black and white, that are in a state of star vation, and in every direction-it is so. I find in a paper published in the city of Washington, called the Star, that in that city4here arc at least twenty thousand col ored people that do not get upon an average one day's .work in six. They are literally running right into the jaws of starvation. The poor-house is overflowing, says this paper, and not able to afford shelter for the swarms ot vagrants that infest the city. Think of it, that within one hundred and thirty miles of the city of Philadelphia, in the Capital of the country, there arc twenty or thirty thousand people that have not comfortable homes and are m a state of starvation. I say we are hypocritical in our thanksgiving if we do not take care of these people. That man is not grateful to God, and he has not the spirit of God, that sees these things as they are, and does not do some thing to alleviate their sufferings. When I go along Chestnut Street, that public thoroughfare, I pee the poor, worn out soldier, with both his leg? or an arm off, lost in the service of thei: country, grinding a barrel organ, soliciting the alms of the passers by. ' , - These poor men, instead of being in that way, 'should have comfortable homes for life, and should be well taken care of. My soul swells with indignation when I see these thing-. A young man came to me j'ester day with his right hand mutilated in the service of his country, and said he could not get anything to do. He had been up and down, but nobody would employ him. " He urged the people not to let thi3 thing go any farther, but to subscribe liberally and furnish a home for those b'rave boys. Court Proceedin itre . The regular December term of Court was held at this place last week, commencing on Monday, and continuing- until Saturday morning. Hon. William Emvem., Presi dent Judge, and his Associates, Irani Derr and Peter K. Jlerbein, were on the bench. On the first day there was very little done, besides taking reports from the different Constables of the County, calling over the list of J urors, charging the Grand Jury and appointing a Foreman for the same. . The following is a synopsis tf the Com monwealth and civil causc3 which were dis posed of during the week: Com. V3. William Beaver. - Indictment, "Larceny.' "True Bill. A Jury was called. Evidence heardx after which the Jury re turned a verdict of "not guilty." : . . .7 J . Com. vs. James S. Chamberlin.

Com. vs.. Sanderson Backman. Indict ment, "Larceny. "in this "case the Grand J ury returned the Indictment, "Not a true bill." : -Com vs.-Michael- Stine. - Indictment, "Assault and battery." " Not a true bill, and the prosecutrix, Margaret Knapp, was made pay the costs. - - t . s . Com. vs. Lewis Bonner. - Indictment, rejecting the vote of a qualified citizen. The Jury found a "true bill ;" but for some rea son or other, the parties were put under bail for their appearance at our next term. Com. vs. Sylvester Hoffman. Indictment, rejecting a vote of a qualified citizen. True bill. Case postponed to February term. John Hinterliter vs. John Jamison. In this case the J ury brought in a verdict for tho Plaintiff for ninety-one dollars and twenty-fn e cents. Jacob Remlcy vs. the Catawissa Railroad Company. Jury called ;afer which, the the Plaintiff made a motion to amend his "declaration." The cause was then con tinued. William Case, ct. al., vs. the Township of Centre. Action for debt Plaintiff receives sixty-one dollars and eleven cents. Greenwood Township vs. Samuel Bogart Action for eubrtriptfon moneys for bounty purposes. - A verdict in favor of the Town ship, for the amount claimed, was rendered. Henry Hosier and Wife vs. Cha. Schlus ser and Wife. For "Slander." Verdict in favor of Plaintiff for five dollars and costs. From Washington. The receipts of internal revenue to-day, Dec. 2d, amount to $1,627,643,85. - Major General Sheridan has forwarded to the War Department a repetition of the charges of inhumanity against the officers at the Dry Tortugas, Florida. It is officially announced that John H. Suratt, one of Lincoln's assassins, has been arrested in Europe. The Radicals declare that this "Government" had information as long ago as last winter, that Suratt was in Europe, and they are making themselves very uneasy over the matter because he was not arrested sooner, and his life taken. They are passionately fond of blood. 

MEXICAN NEWS. . Letters from the City of Mexico, receiv ed at Washington, dated Nov. 11, state the fact that General Bazaine had given arms and ammunition to his Mexican Liberals, and promised them that they would not be interfered with by the French forces, provi ded they pronounced for General Ortega, and proclaimed him as Presidentof Mexico, THE 

REPEAL OF THE AMNESTY LAW. It is generally understood that the Senate will pass the House bill for the repeal of the Amnesty Law. It was reported back favor ably a few days ago by Mr. Trumbull, from the Judiciary Committee, which indicates that it is to receive a full party vote. The better impression is that the President will not approve it, and that Congress will then pass it by the requisite two-thirds vote. THE 

APPOINTING POWER. Mr. Stevens will this week endeaver to press to a vote his bill limiting the Presi dent's power of appointment to and remov al from office. It seems to be more satisfac tory to the majority than any measure of th kind yet introduced, and the general opinion is that it will receive a full party vote in the House, though it may afterwards be subject ed to amendment in the Senate. THE SENATORIAL CAUCUS. A caucus of Eadical Senators took place lately, called expressly to consult with re gard to the admission of Colorado and Ne braska into the Union. No formal question was taken. But it was agreed that the bills for thi3 purpose should be called up this week. It is rumored that all the French troops -mm. will leave Mexico on or about the 1st of March next. A sensible conclusion on the part of the French. MILITIA IN SOUTHERN STATES. It is said Sejator Wilson will endeavor to get a vote this week on his joint resolution to disband all'militia organizations in those States hereafter. THE TAX ON COTTON. Many leading members of the House think it highly probable that the internal tax on cotton will be reduced by the present session of Congress. NEW 

ORLEANS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE. It is expected that the speaker of the House will soon announce the names of the members appointed a special committee to visit New Orleans, and investigate the causes &c, of the late riot in that city. The com mittee will probably leave for the South on Tuesday, and be absent about four weeks. THE SOUTHERN TERRITORY" BILL. There is much discussion out of Congress upon the bill looking to the abrogation of the fctate governments of the South, and the opponents of the measure are confident they can defeat it in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote over the veto could not be secured. Carbon County Progressing. The School Directors of Carbon County met in Coaveution 011 Tuesday, November 27, and increased the salary of the County Superintendent, Mr. R. H. IIofford, from tWO to $1,100 per annum. The Directors of Carbon are moving in the right direction. They saw other counties in the State were paying liberal salaries to Superintendent, and using the general State fund for educa tional purposes ; and although there arc but ona hundred schools in Carbon County, they desired that the Superintendent should be remunerated sufficiently that he could devote his whole time to the schools and not be compelled to neglect the work of education in following other pursuits to gain a liveli hood. The County Superintendent is re quired to make at least two circuits through th2 county one for examinations of teach ers and another to visit each school While performing these duties he is continually bur dened with the expenses of travel, which, with the present rates of living, will soon amount to half the sum of eight hundred dollars. The expenses of keeping a horse trill, of itself, make a large expense. Thus any one may see the wisdom of the Carbom County Directors."" r V" .f -4 The Superintendents are paid from the State fund, and hence each ! county contrib Tites to pay the Salaries of all other. County Superintendents in the State, as well as the salary of its own Superintendent. There fore, while many counties in convention vote salaries from $1,500 to $2,000 per annum, it was thought by the Directors of Carbon that their Superintendent should receive at least a living compensation. The work of the Superintendent of Carbon County if it be considered in reference to the number of schools is not quite two-thirds of the work to be done by the Superintendent of Co lumbia. Carbon has one hundred schools, Columbia one hundred and sixty-four. The salary in Columbia is just the amount paid in Carbon before the increase $800. Blair, with one hundred and thirty-eight schools pays $1,000. Clearfield, with one hundred schools, pays $1,000. Delaware, with ninety eight schools, pays $800. Lawrence, with one hundred and forty-two schools, pays $1,000. . Teachers' County Institute. The attention of Teachers, Directors and all other persons, feeling an interest in edu cational progress, is called to the County Teachers' Institute, to be held in Blooms burg, the latter part of this month. The Institute will be called to order at 10 o'clock, A. M., on Wednesday, tho 26th inst, and continue during the remainder of the week, holding three sessions "eah day. It is of the very greatest importance to the educa tional interests of Columbia County, that a special effort be made by every individual to secure a full attendance of Teachers, Directors, and others, earnest in promoting general intelligence. These Institutes afi'ord peculiar opportunities to Teachers to ac quire knowledge of the best methods of conducting Schools of governing and in structing. They may, also, be found bene ficial to Directors, by conveying to them many ideas of management and skillful in struction in schools, from which Directors, and particularly District Superintendent, may more readily understand the condition of Schools when visited, and form intelli gent opinions of the Teacher's competency, in truth, the Institute is not only as be lieved by many a mer- personal benefit to Teachers, but resuits in arousing greater earnestness in intellectual pursuits with those who attend, and through them the same spirit of advancement is carried to the whole people. It is urged, therefore, that all persons will use their best efforts to cause a Buccesal'ul County Institute. . Let Teachers and Directors work together, and let there be not only a full attendance of Teachers, but also of Directors. Experienced Institute Conductors and Lecturers will be in attend ance throughout the session. JOrf.
