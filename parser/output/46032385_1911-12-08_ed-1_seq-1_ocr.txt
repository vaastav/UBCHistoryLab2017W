The Baltimore Sun is right on some ques tions hut it seems to be a little muddled on Mr. Bryan's suggestion that the public ought to know upon what recommendations the judges are appointed. Mr. Bryan has answered Mr. Taft'i challenge by naming three corporations which are declared guilty of violating the law but against which' Mr. Taf t fails to bring a criminal prosecution. In the case of the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases the supreme court has already declared the defendants guilty. Why not prose cute the officials? The administration has recently commenced an equity suit against the Steel trust, accusing it of violating the law. Why not bring criminal prosecution? But the presi dent's attention is called to two other cases the Trans-Mississippi case of thirteen years ago and the Merger case of more recent date. Ac cording to the reasoning of the court in the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, the Merger case and the Traffic case would now be decided in favor of the defendants, whereas, both of these cases were under a formor interpre'tation of the law decided against the defendants. The trouble about President Taft's challenge is that it would be impossible to determine his proposition by suit before the next election. He is therefore in a position to run a bluff upon the public. But the Baltimore Sun does not seem to understand the importance of publicity as to the appointment of judges. Will it give its readers, any good reason why the public should not know upon what recommendations the president ap points? How can the public know that ho selected the best men brought before him with out knowing something about the recommenda tions? And how can the public be sure that the great corporate interests have not dictated ap pointments so long as the recommendations aro kept secret? We are now to have publicity as to campaign contributions, and we are to have that publicity before the election the presi dent has signed the bill. If it is desirable to know before the election what financial in fluences are at work to select congressmen, sena tors and presidents, what harm can there be in knowing what influences operate in the selec tion of judges. It is no indictment of the president to urge him to make the recommendations known but a refusal to make them known when there is no good reason for refusing, can not but excite suspicion. The Baltimore Sun 1b respectfully invited to treat this question with the candor and frankness which characterizes its treatment of other 'questions. 'It is no longer sufficient

WASHINGTON NEWS to demand proof of a corrupt motive. Publicity serve a double purpose. It not only furnishes proof of a corrupt motive If such motive exists, but it also tends to prevent action from a cor rupt motive. The day is past when the preda tory interests can put our courts into a glass case and then command pcoplo not to throw stones. The day of publicity is at hand, and we need it not only In regard to recommenda tions for the bench .but in regard to tho owner ship of our metropolitan papers and in regard , to the campaign funds employed to nominate presidential candidates. MORE WIRELESS OPERATORS Mr. Bryan learned a lesson from" the wreck of the "Joachim." Ho believes this lesson ought to be utilized for tho protection of the public. The passengers on the vessel owe their rescue to the wireless. Without it they would now be on AtwoodsKoy, the littlo island near which their ship went upon the rocks; and as the island is about thirty-three miles off tho line of travel they might have been there for some time. ' But while the wireless brought a ship they learned that the smaller ships havo BUT ONE OPERATOR and, as ho must havo time for sleep, there is a part of the time approximately one-third when a distress signal can not bo heard, no matter how near a ship may be to tho scone of the accident. Take this particular case, for instance; .the ship wont upon the rocks at 3:45 a. m. The wireless operator at once signalled for help. He received an answer from New York, and from six other stations scattered along the coast be tween New York and western Cuba, but could not get into connection with any ship, for tho reason that tho operators rest from 1:30 to 6 a. m. In thi3 case the danger was not Immediate and a few hours did not make any difference, but an hour might mean life or death to all on board. It is the opinion of all tho passengers on tho "Joachim" and officers as well as pas sengers share the opinion, that provision should bo made for at least two operators on each ship so that signals of distress could bo heard at all hours. This matter should bo brought to the attention of the appropriate committees of the senate and house. The hours that passed between 3:45 and the answer from the relief ship were anxious ones for the "Joachim" passengers, and it Is easy to imagine tho greater anxiety that would have been felt if the ship had been sinking. IT OUGHT TO PASS Representative Cyrus Cline of Indiana, Intro duced in the house of representatives a joint resolution having the following title: "To declare the purpose of the United States to relinquish control over the Philippines, estab lish an independent government for them, and protect the same by a general treaty of neu trality." The resolution follows: "Resolved by the senate and house of repre sentatives of the United States of America in congress assembled, "First. That it is the ultimate purpose of tho United States to cease exercising sovereignty over the Philippine Islands as a dependency of the United States. "Second. That the United States declares its purpose and settled policy to be to establish and grant a stable and independent government for the Philippine Islands as soon as conditions necessary for such government shall exist. "Third. 'That tho president of the United States be respectfully requested to consider tho expediency of opening negotiations with the great powers of the world with a view of estab lishing, by joint treaty, the neutrality of the Philippine Islands and the protection of their independence." It will bo the duty of democrats in congress to declare themselves on this Bubject and Mr. Cline's resolution conforms to the position taken by the democratic party In at least three na tional conventions.
