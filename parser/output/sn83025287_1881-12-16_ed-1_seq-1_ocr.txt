Scoville began to cross-examine witn *; when Guiteau, in a great rage shout:d: ■" never saw this man but once in my life, *< that was in 1873. Never saw him bat fi > c minutes. What does he know about me. This shows just how little sense yoa have got, Corkhill, to put up this man as an expert, and you haven't got common horse sense to waste the time of the court in exam ining bis character. He was only a clerk in a lawyer's office, anyway." Re-examined by Col. Corkhill, witness said: "In my opinion, at the tine I knew him, he was perfectly competent to distinguish be tween right and wrung." Exception by Sco ville. Mr. Scnville as <ed witness what his opinion was of the prisoner's ability to dis tinguish between right and wrong at the pres ent time. The question was ; ruled out and an exception noted by Scoville. <.- ;V^< V :r~- K. M. Justice, lawyer, Logansport, Ind., met the prisoner in 1878. 7 Prisoner was selling a book on the life of Moody. "I -T * ; . • Guiteau interrupted," you art mixing one op with someone else, sir." Witness continued, but was again interrupted by Guiteau, who shouted: "Stop right here. Can you prove me a* the man?" Witne s— "l think I can." Guiteau— "Chi you swear to it?" Witness— I can." Guiteau— you are a liar, sir; a miser able liar. That is the best way to dispose of you." Witness continuing said the prisoner re mained in Logansport about three weeks, sell ing the book. Guitiau continually interjected abusive com ments, and finally shouted: "You miserable whelp. To coma in here to make one out as a book agent. I was preaching the gospel and sold my productions." In a few minutes he turned to Scoville with intense disgufe.: •Oh, cut this fool short. He is lying all through. Don't wast; time on him." Scoville asked. "What was the appearance of the prisoner, when you knew him?" Ans.— looked about the same same as now, except about the eyes." Scoville— "V^hat was the difference in the expression of the eyes?" Ans.— "At that time he had a f ree expres -:__ VT~_ «U. _„„..,.,..,:„.. menu n,nr,n>liul >' 

VIUU. HUff LUC Ci.f>IC3MUU ECCUID DU|I}MCH«U( Guiteau— don't think lam much sup pressed this morning. It seems to me I'm pretty lively." Guiteau greatly worked him self into a towering rage, and declared against the witness of the prosecution and threatened him with violence, his billinsgat? being es pecially directed against tue prosecuting at torney. Referring to Col. Corkhill he said: "He is getting too dirty and too stinking to lie, and the first thing he know's, God Al mighty will take him off and send him down below." - Rev. Russell R. Shippen, pastor of All Souls' church, Washington, was boarder at the same house and occupied a seat at the same table with the prisoner, from April last until the day before the murder of the presi dent, when he (prisoner) disappeared. Wit ness had frequently conversed with the prison er. Both had lived in Chicago, and that form ed the basis of conversation, which led to quite a familiar acquaintanceship. Prisoner was chatty and polite, a little quick or ngr vous in utterance, but not sufficiently to indi cate marked peculiarity. Witness never de tected anything to indicate ' insanity. Tiie. usual topics of conversation between himself and prisoner at table were' Conkling, GarSel ':! and the new testament revision. On no ocr •ion did prisoner exhibit more excitement .Ik.'i any other person might. * Mrs. Dunmire, formerly wife of Guiteau, then took the stand. She was married to pris oner in July, 1868. Scoville objected to tbv testimony unless a record proof of the wit ness was shown. Witness was then with drawn. Corkhiil remarked that he would n ■ troduce witness' letter, after he obtained the necessary copy of the record. Dr. Noble, a young physician at the j . where Guiteau is confined, recited the parti' - lars of several conversations with the prisoi At one time he asked the prisoner why he ' moved" (using the prisoner's term) the pr dent. Hi* reply was, "Because I was insp' to do so." A little after he «iid: " "If , president should die I would be convinced 1 3 inspiration was from the Deity; but if ne should recover I would be in doubt about it." Witness was asked if he considered the pris oner sane, and replied: "A perfectly sane man, sir; and as bright, quick and intelligent as you would see in a cummer's day Not the slight est indication of insanity about him. A little impatient of restraint, at times a little nervous, as a man in his proition would naturally be, but'perfectly sane." Mrs. Scoville suddenly rose in her place and said: "Your honor, I would like to ask a question of the witness. I consider it of vital importance to the case." Guiteau, (impatiently)— " Now, don't, sister. It is all these people can do to stand me with out your talking. You are no lawyer." Mrs. Scoville— "The question is of vital im portance." Scoville— "l prefer,, your honor, that the permission should not be given." Davidge— "Let Mrs. Scoville suggest the question to her husband, and we will not ob ject." Mrs. Scoville, (sotto voee)— "Well, he don't know how to ask any questions, any way." Scoville asked if it were possible to place in the prisoner's coffee any drugs that would make him brighter or more quiet, as the case might be. Guiteau with presumptuous expression ex claimed: You are examining a witness on the other side, aint you, Scoville? 1 never saw anything so stupid as your manner of ex am mine witness this forenoon. I think your lecture last night must have been too much for you." Mrs. Scoville wiote her question and reached over to hand it to her husband when Guiteau sharply said to her: "Now you just mind your business and attend to your own affairs. You are making yourself altogether too offi cious in this case:" Fending the colloquy between Guiteau and his sister the witness was permitted to de part, much to the disappointment, apparent* ly, of Mrs. Scoville. Gen. Joseph S. Reynold's, lawyer, Chicago, knew prisoner first about May, 1866, in Chi cago. Witness visited prisoner in jail ten days after the assassination. "Prisoner asked me 'where Were you on the day of the assassination? 1 " Corkhiil— "Did he use the word assassin ate?" Witness— "Yes; that is the precise word he used ." Witness made a memorandum of the note s of his conversation with the prisoner at the interview. To refresh his mtmory he was allowed to read from them. Witness read two or three lines, quoting the prisoners words, and used the word "at^sassination." Col. Corkhiil— "Did he use that term?" Witness— "He used that word and never spoke in refeience to any divine inspiration at this interview. After this, at subsequent in terviews, he always spoke of the murder as 'removfl of the president.' " At this point Guilecu shouted: "This man came to me as an old friend from Chicago, when really he was nothing but a spy, employed by Corkhiil. I want to thunder this to the Amer ican people, to let them understand what this man's character is." Then turning to Cork hill: "This is your work, CorkbilT, and God Almighty will damn yoa for it. Too have deceived me all through, and stole my thoughts and betrayed iiem." Witness continued to read from notes Ibe had taken at the second interview with the prisoner. Allusion being made to something which appeared in the Washington Republican, Guiteau pounded upon the desk and shouted out: "That is just what that little whelp, Gorham, was writing at that time. Now he is ready to eat his words. He is hanging around Arthur now; and trying to get some little office. He ought to be ashamed of him self, :f: f he has any decency. I have got a speech on this .'ellow, Gorham. I only want to get a chance at him. Witness stated he read to the prisoner what Grant aod Conkling and some of his (prison ers) alleged friends said of him (Guiteau) and his crime, and h :, walking the floor, excited ly, said: "What does it mean? I would have staked my life that they would have defended me. They know they wanted Garfield re moved, and yet they denounce me, I can only 'see in it the bloody act." Witness also '■' showed him some papers in which (Guiteau) was bitterly denounced for tbe crime, and his (prisoners) comment was that the true facts had been suppressed, and he had not had any defense. Witness continued: "He asked me, refer-, ring to Grant, Conkling and other prominent stalwarts: 'Do they know I have stated that I have no accomplices?' I told him yes. He seemed d&vd and said, repeating the words several times: 'Most astounding. Most as tounding.' " Guiteau then broke in and said with a sneer, "yoa was a pretty smart detective, wasn't you, general. Ton will probably get more business in this line now.'' Recess. 

AFTERNOON SESSION. Immediately after recess Gui f ,au an lounc j- iha had a little speech to make, and said: «•; suppose I have given 1,000 autographs since the trial began. It has been suggested that I shall charge twenty five cents for them but I decline. We want money, however, for t (is trial. There are certain office holders in this city md throughout the country thai never would have had their positions but for my inspiration. I want these men, if they have got any consciences, to respond to this appeal and send us some money. If they don't do it I shall speak oat in meeting and give their names next time. Some rich men in Ne w York gave Mrs. Garfield several hundred thousand dollars. It was a noble act and I approve it. Now I want them to give me some. I demand it the name of justice and right." Col. Corkhiil introduced in evidence an ap plicat'on made by Guiteau ten days ago for a policy of life insurance, in which tbe pris oner answered in the negative the question : "Has there ever been any Insanity in your fam'ly?" . Gea Reynolds continued : "At my second interview with prisoner he wrote an address to the American people, -which has since been published, and handed it to me with the re quest that I have it published." The original draft was then introduced and was read by Col. Corkhiil, with occasional comments by Guiteau, who followed the read ing with the closest attention. When the word "inspiration" was read, Judge Porter arose and called attention to the (act that this was the first announcement of "inspiration" as a defense for the murder, and that it was made on the 19th of July, after the prisoner learned that Arthur, Grant.Conk ling, and other stalwarts, that he expected would shield him, in reality loatbed him and abhorred his act. "It is a lie, Mister Big mouthed Porter," shouted Guiteau. Scoville protested against this style of ar gument to the jury, and demanded that Judge Portsr should withdraw the remark. Judge Porter— "l shall not withdraw one word I shall say upon this trial." A number of letters written by Guiteau since his incarceration were read by the disti c attorney, and were offered in evidence to dis prove the theory of insanity. After the rea< - ing was concluded Guiteau turned to the district attorney and enquired: "Where are the rest of my letters, Corkhiil, that you intercepted? I think the American people ought to know what a miserable sneak you are." Scoville questioned witness (Gen. Reynolds) until the hour of adjournment "Have you always been on good terms with the prisoner?" asked Scoville. "Yes," shouted the prisoner. "I always censidered him my personal friend, and he proved himself a mean, dirty scoundrel. A nice record you'll have, Reynolds, to come into my ceil to get information to hang me " Bcoville questioned witness closely, and finally received the answer that the govern ment paid him for his expenses while he was having these interviews. Guiteau— "How much?" Scoville (putting out his hand)— "Yoa keep quiet." Guiteau— "Well, then, ask him how much he got. You take an hour to get oat of him what I could learn in ten minutes." Scoville asked witness how much he re ceived, and the reply was "Eighty-five dol lars." Guiteau— "Three interviews. Well, that's , pretty good. About $30 a day for lying. That's more than Corkhiil earns, but then he'll get his reward down below in the next world." The cross-examination became rather tedi ous, without eliciting anything new or mate rial, and Guiteau protested frequently that the time of the court should not be wasted by such "loose, zig-zag sort of talk." Finally with great importance he shouted: "Oh, say your aunt was tout uncle. 'T would bo i lout as sensible as your questions. You are Du>st as stupid as Corkhiil. Come, your .nor, let's go home." Court adjourned. Crnsy Cashier. PouGHXK*TSH, N. T., Dec. 15.— 1t is stated u.it Hallo way, the alleged defaulting paying teller of the Bank of Poughkeepsie, has been mentally disturbed for six months. Checks, notes, tetters and papers of importance were found in oat of the way places. One letter, written six months ago, was opened to-day and found to contain a check; an old overcoat contained checks and notes, as did also a pair of cast off pantaloons. Men waiting to pay bills have been credited with the amount due. The accounts are in the utmost confusion. Attempt to Wreck a P— linger Train. Toledo, Dec 15.— An attempt was made at Delta, twenty-five miles west of Toledo last night, to wreck the passenger train com ing east on the Air line division of the Lake Shore road. A tie was laid across the track, which the engineer discovered but struck be fore stopping. The shock derailed the front trucks of the locomotive. An ex-conductor at Wauscon, who had been pat eff the day previous, was arrested on suspicion. Five Men Drowned. Charleston. W. Va.. Dec 15.— ThU morn ing a number of employes engaged at govern ment lock No. 3, left their boarding house to go to their work, embarking in skiffs as the usual custom. Three skiffs containing eight men were caught in the current and carried over the dam. Five men were drowned, namely, M. Moore, Jas. Brown, Wm. Hunter, Thornton and Fraedon. Good Xwefc.

Daily WASHINGTON NOTES. : ncroU Davis Assistant secretary o State -A Heat of Postmasters Confirmr a -Whlttaker Probably Found Onllty— Elaine's Reception— -The Mississippi Blver Improvement. Washington, Dec. 15.— The senate com mittee on finance have unanimously agreed to recommend the passage of Sherman's 3 per cent, funding bill, with amendments reducing the aggregate amount of 3 per cent bonds to be issued to $300,008,000, and providing the amount of deposit to be received shall not ex ceed at any one time $25,000,000. The com mittee took this action after hearing Secretary Folger, who expressed himself in opposition to the proposition, preferring to retain to the government the privilege of calling in 3% per cent, bonds at any time. The committee of the American Bar associa tion, after paying respects to the supreme court, met at noon and discussed plans for the establishment of a court that w 11 relieve the supreme court of a pressure of business. Entire harmony exists between the supreme judges, and bar committee and judiciary committee. They all agree that some prompt action to relieve the supreme court is neces sary, and indications are that a plan will be agreed upon and a bill introduced in congress to carry it out be "ore the holiday adjourn ment. It is likely that a court of intermediate jurisdiction will be created, or somt thing like a court of appeal. Then the docket of the su preme court will be sifted, and all cases that can be taken from it and sent to the new court will be so transferred. Some early action will certainly be taken. The president has nominated J. C. Bancroft Davis, New York, assistant secre.ary of state. Plumb to-day introduced a bill authorizing the owners of silver bullion tt» deposit it in any mint or %ssay office, under such regula tions as the secretary of the treasury may make, and receive therefor silver dollars or silver certificates up to the market value of the bullion. The bill also modifies the silver bill of 1878, by providing that coinage of silver dollars shall continue until the amount of dollars represent 30 per cent, of the silver certificates* outstanding, and that silver dollar coinage shall be kept at this proportion and not go beyond it. Plumb says his idea is to avoil tbe accumulation of more silver dollars than are reeded, but keep on hand all that are needed, that it !»* useless expose to keep mints running to coin money not needed iv circulation or for redemption of certificates. It is the general belief that the verdict in Cadet WhiUaker's court martial was unfavor able to him and recommended his dismissal from tbe academy, but that the view of tbe proceedings by the judge advocate general and the report thereon by the secretary of war will result in the president setting aside the findings of the court and ordei ing the rein statement of Whittaker. Senator Hale introduced four bills to-day on tbe subject of congressional reapportionment, in order to bring the whols subject before the census committee (of which he is chairman) as soon as possible, with a view of t-ei-uriug fiual legislation at an early period of the present session. The bill introduced by Senator Plumb, to provide for the issuance of silver bullion, di rects the secretary of the treasury to receive silver bullion at the mints and assay offices in sums not less than e',ooo, and issue therefor, as depositors may elect, standard s :i ver dollars or silver certificates, the coinage of standard silver dollars to be suspended, after the passage of the bill nntil the amount of standard silver dollars in the treasury shall equal S3 per centum of the silver certificates issued and outstanding, and shall then be resumed; but only such amount shall be coined thereafter as shall be required to*presene that proportion of standard silver dollars in the treasury and silver certificates c standing... Senator Merrill, chairman of the senate finance committee, will introduce a bill to en able national bank associations to extend their corporate existence, in accordance with re commendations in the last annual report o. the comptroller of currency. The president to-day pardoned Jas. R. Bum bough, of Pennsylvania, convicted of em bezzl'ment. The treasury department purchased 354,008 ounces of fine silver to-day for the Philadel phia, New Orleans and San Francisco mints. THE 

COTTON CBOF. The condition of the cotton crop as report ed to the department of agriculture is lower than in any season since 1866. December re turns, compared with last year, areas follows: North Carolina 71, South Carolina 77, Georgia 80, Florida 93, Alabama 83, Mississippi 73, Louisiana 83, Texas 66, Arkansas 50, and Tennes9see 53. Taking reports of the season together up to December 1, indications point to a crop of about" 4,900,0C3 bales, and a somewhat lighter product appears possible. The senate committee on railroads heard Senator Hoxey iv advocacy of his bill to rati fy the act of the general council of the Choc taw nation Indians, granting the St. Louis & San Francisco Railway company the right of way for a railroad and telegraph line, and sub sequently placed tbe measure in charge of a sub-committee, consisting of Generals Brown, Jones, and Bewell, with authority to report it to the senate with recommendation for pass age, with or without amendments, as the sub committee may determine. BLAINS RECEPTION Secretary Blame will give a reception to his successor, Secretary Frellnghuysen, Monday evening, on which occasion the diplo matic corps will be presented to the new secretary of state. Frelinghuysen paid his respects to President Arthur to-day. 'CROWDS OF CILLERS. The rush of callers at the White house con tinues. The Massachusetts congressional del egation called in a body, also the Pennsyl vania delegation. A colored delegation urged the appointment of Col. Webster as collector of tbe port of Baltimore. A delegation of business men of Baltimore asked the reap pointment of Naval Officer Corcoran at Balti more. Tbe Mississippi delegation, headed by ex-Representative Lynch, had a conference with the president on the Mississippi plan last evening. There was an exparti argument before the secretary of the treasury by Crowley, Rich and Hooper, members of congress, upon the petitions of the manufacturers of stoves to have revoked or modified some regulations or instructions, so that stoves of size casks, etc., shall be charged at the rate of 10 per cent, duty ad valorem, and all other stoves at 20 per cent, advalorem. *

FOLOEB'B VIEWS OH BBTUNPING. In conversation this afternoon relative to his statements made before the senate com mittee on finance to-day, on the subject of refunding, Secretary Folger said he advanced BT, PIUL, FBIDAY MORNING, DECEMBEB 16, 1881. substantially the same views as were embod ied in bis annual report. In response to in quiries of members of the committee he said that in his opinion the period of five years mentioned in the Sherman bill, for the pay ment pf the bonds, wan rather short. He also questioned the practicability of floating new bonds, and referred to tbe possibility of the entire a-nount of tbe Cj* per cents, being re deemed, leaving no advantageous opening for placing surplus revenues. When asked if be was opposed to the bill in question tbe secre tary said, that the treasury department of course would use every endeavor to success fully carry out any enactment which congress should see fit to make regarding the disposi tion of surplus revenues. MISSISSIPPI BIVSR COMMISSION. Everett B. Sanders, Wisconsin, was appoint ed enrolling clerk of tbe house, and VV. M. Leonard, Ohio, reading clerk. The senate to-day received from the secretary of war the annual report of the Mississippi river commission. It covers the progress made in savings and examinations from the date of last report, January 8, 1881, up to Oc tober 10, 1881. During this period triangulation of the rivers hastyen completed fro-n Arkansas City, Ark., to Greenville, Miss., where it joins the coast sewer. The river now triangulates Keo kuk, la. , to the Gulf of Mexico. Lines of pre cisc levels are completed between Keokuk and New Orleans. With the remainder of the present appropriation, it is hoped, during the coming year, to complete the work of ascer taining the lines of level across the alluvial bottoms of the Mississippi. The commission report they have expended $144,000 for surveys from December 11, 1880, to November 19,1881, and have a balance of appropriation on hand of $111,000, which, it is thought, will be expended during the re mainder of the current year, ending January 30, 1852. The estimates for the next fiscal year for surveys, etc., call for $200,000. The works of improvement contemplated under existing appropriations include channel im provements upon two reaches, the first lying between Cairo »nd Memphis, a distance of 155 miles, the second between Sbipwith's Land ng, La., and Island No. 95, a distance of twenty five miles. It is the unanimous opinion of the commit tee that tbe improvement in navigation of the Mississippi below Cairo, upon the general plau recommended in their report of Feoruat y 17, 1880, is entirely practicable, and that the completion of the work, for which partial es timates were then submitted, establishes a con tinuous low river channel, not less than ten feet deep, over all shoaU and bars between Ca rlo and the head of tbe passes, with a possi bility of attaining pra ticable depths consider ably beyond that limit.

SENATE DOINGS. The Question of Presidential Inabl'lfy Coi>»ld>r*d— When Does It Occur?— Blain*'« Clayton-Bnlwer Treaty Letters Snbmttted. Washington, Dec. 15.— Petitions wer« presented by Sherman and Ferry for the regu lation of railroad transportation routes, and by Piumb and -Mitchell for the regulation Of taxes on bank deposits and checks. Sherman, from the committee on finance, reported favorably with amendments the bill to provide for the issue of 3 per cent, bonds. Sherman will ask its consideration immediate ly after holiday. Bills introduced and referred : By Coke, to regulate inter-state commerce and prohibit un just discriminations by common carriers. By Beck, to repeal taxes on deposits with banks] banking associations- and bankers. B} Plurab, to authorize the issue of silver cer tificates and standard silver dollars on deposit of silver bullion ; also, to grant the right of way through Fort Bliss military reservation to the Rio Grande &£1 Paso Railroad com pany. By Ingall's, a resolution instructing the committee on pensions to inquire and report what increase of pension, if any, should be al lowed the widow of Abraham Lincoln. Adopted. The subjects referred to in the president's message were referred to appropriate commit te.-s. The resolution for a woman suffrage com mittee came up, but the morning hour expired wiilio.it action upon it The discussion on the presidential succes sion in contingencies provided for was re sumed, and Garland addressed the senate. He said tbe president pro tern, of the senate and speaker of the house had been he Id to be offi cers in the sense in which the word is used in the clause of the constitu tion, inasmuch as they were office r s of their houses respectively, but enough of duubt had been thrown upon it to require the matter to be placed beyond further cavil. His answer to the objections of the senator from Kentucky (Beck) that "cabinet officers, to whom tbe true cuccesMon is given by his bill, might be int- Visible as not possessing presi dential qualifications," was, that a require ment ihat such officers, shail hayethea quali fications could be added to the bill, ana also a provision to meet the possible case of the cab met b ing implicated as particeps criminis with an impeached president. He disagreed with that sen tor as to the pro priety of vesting the provisional succession in judges of the supreme court, as the president ial duties were beyond question such as re quired an executive rather than a judicial or legislative officer. The succession should desci nd in that line which was indicated by the verdict at the quadrennial election. As to when presidential inability arises, or a<> to determining that inability, he said con gress is unable to determine, and the only means for tbe determination of that question would be a constitutional amendment. The clause of the constitution simply gives to the right to say what offi cer shall act' and neither in that nor anywhere el«e is it empowered to pass upor inability. The truth is, it was in tended to ba left to the president and vice president as a matter to be settled between them If Vice-President Arthur was in full accord with President Garfield, did any one doubt he would i c c tiled on to act in the latter'e stead within ten days after the "resident was shot? Because it was then generally known, not withstanding the dispatches that went out from Washington to the .contrary, that the president would not survive. Suppose the idea of the inability of the president had become generally entertained by the country, and that upon being waited on and informed of the popular belief, he denied there was any ground for it and held onto his i ffice, how could the remedy be applied? There was no remedy, for behind the presi dent was the military to suoport his claim. There was no means for determining what constituted inability, as the constitutional provision was intended to be self sustaining, without any intervention by congress with the coordinate branch of the government. Various instances of inability might be sue gested, one of which was the absence of the president at the head of the army, in which case the vire president would act. He assert ed he had proposed vesting the succession in executive officers in contra distinction witb legislative and judicial officers of the govern ment. becau°e, although open to objections that had not been suggested, was the best he conceive of. Coke urged the duty of congress to provide promptly for averting these complications. Jones (Florida), advocated an amendment to Beck's resolution, so as to provide for an in quiry whether any additional provisions of law or changes in the power of the constitu tion are necessary to secure stability in office of the president pro tern. of the senate when the vice president becomes president of the United States in the contingencies provided for. Jones' argument was not concluded, when a message was received from the president of the United States, transmitting a communica tion from the secretary of the interior in refer ence to applications of tbe Chicago Texas & Mexican Central and St. Louis & Sauta Fee railway companies, for the right of way acrof-s the lands of the Choctow nation, in Indian Territory, for building a proposed railroad and telegraph line. The communica tion was accompan'ed with copies of instruc tions and a report by a special agent designa ted to present applications to the authorities of the Choctaw nation, with a bill pas-ed by the general councl and approved by the prin cipal chief, granting such right of way subject to a ratification by congress, and a report of the Indian commissioner in f tvor of the pro posed legislation, in all of which the secretary concurs. Referred to committee on railroad*. Brown, from the committee on territories, reported favorably a bill ratifying the action of the council of the Uhoctaw nation, grant ing the St. Louis & Santi F»* railroad com pany the right of way lor a railroad and tele graph line through the territory. On motion, placed on the calendar. Plumb introduced a bill granting the right of way through Fort Selden military reserjar tion, New Mexico, to the Rio Giande, Meart can & Pacific railway.
