u I M Semi-Weekly Interior Journal 5,1890 W. P. WALTON. The president's message is a long and tiresome documentof 12,000 vvords.which our imtronB will thank us lor not inflict the McKinley tariff bill and pleads with the ignorant common people to study it more and give it a fair trial. He thinks reciprocity a good thing, but is not as much taken with it as Blaine. A Force bill is needed, he avers, to regulate our Congressional elections, but it should be thoroughly non-partisan, though at the same time advocates a bill by which his party can do its own registration, its own enumeration and its own certification. Knowing that our boasted surplus had "yanisbed into thin air" and the balance is now on the other side of the ledger, he counsels Congress to economize' after congratulating it on tho great work it accomplished during its first session, and tho permanent good it did the country. The president does not seem to have heard of the recent verdict of the people against the outragesag.iinstthem, either enated or proposed, and writes as if he were a kiug und not subject to their dictation and demands. The Presbyterian don't cuss, but a reader between the lines can see that he has as much contempt for the people m if he had said with Vanderbilt, "Tho people he d-d." Gen. Gkken Clay Smith delivered an address in tho Hall of the House of Del. egates at Frankfort Monday night on tho subject of prohibition, but only a small number of those he wished especially to hear him attended. The fact is, tho members of the convention are too fond of their own chin music to enjoy Gen. Smith's or anybody else'B and therefore 6tayed away. The general very considerately said he didn't ask that prohibition be inserted in the constitution, but he did ask that tho people be given a chance to vote on it as an independent proposition. He would give, if he could, those who are engaged in tho liquor traffic, which he charges is responsible for SO per cent, of the crime and a large portion i,f the idiocy, lunacy and poverty of the country, till 1900 to close out and seek a moro elevating employment. The general is a pretty good talker and his address was, as usual, worthy of himself and the cause ho represented. Immediately on the assembling of s Congress Gov. McCreary introduced a bill to place tin and tin-plate, cotton ties, agricultural implements and edged tools, binder's twine, blankets, worsted used for men and women's clothing and Bait on the free list. Said ho to a reporter: "Of course the democrats will seek to.re vise the tariff, but I thought I would first give the republicans a chance, "and see if they have learned the lesson taught them by the elections." The gov ernor will find that they nave learned nothing. If any relief comes to the people it "must be through the democratic party, of which Gov. McCreary is bo earnest and able exponent. When Clifton R. Breckinridge, whose eeat was stolen from him by Reed and his minions, appeared at the bar of the House Monday to bo sworn in, after his constituency had expressed its contempt for the outrage on him, he was tho recipient of a perfect ovation. Tho democrats cheered themselves hoarse and basket after basket of choice flowers were sent him by admiring ladies. Meantime Reed looked liko a miserable culprit and hia fellow robbers felt like going into their holes and drawing them in after them. It was a moment of supreme triumph for right und justice. Instead of $-1,000,000 increase in tho Thk democratic newspapers aro not Tory highly pleased with the president's message. The 2f. Y. Star says "it is simS ply a weak excuse for the shortcomings of the president's party." Tho World remarks that "it is a singularly ing on them, though not a dozen would t ,mg nQ po,icy t(J rccoiumen(l to the have read it had wo done bo. It is chief lv remarkable for its bull-headed ness and the studied attempt all through to show himself the great I and tho people tho little u, for he tells them plainly that the McKinley bill is n good thing and that the reason they do not think so is because of their ignorance. Tho paper starts off by congratulating tho country that his party has collected S 130,000,000 without stealing nny of it, though that is yet to ho seen. A good deal of space is devoted to the State department, but he manages to tell nothing with winch the reading public is not familiar. He touches lightly on tho silver question and says that our large supply of gold, if not lost by impulsive legislation in tho supposed interest of silver, will carry us through. He is much pleased with the management of the post-office by Bror. Wana-maker, although it has cost $o,7SG,o00 more than it paii. The civil service law, so far as ho knows, has been executed with fidelity, but it is a subject he evi dently doesn't care to discuss and therefore does not do so. The pension enactments are so liberal now that he thinks great scrutiny should be given bills for special relief, both for, the cause and the amount. He is especially solicitous about estinif document. His attitude is ono of nhstinnto, untcachahlo and his utterances thoroughly partisan." The Courier-Journal calls it "a stale, flat and unprofitable document, a confession upon the part of the administration that people or to its party that holds out to them any pronupo of a return of public confidence. Tho democrats can ask nothing better than to have the campaign of which opens with the president's message, conducted on the lines which ho lays down." Wo might give many others, but these express the general sentiment with reference to the perfunctory and colorless document. Thk democratic victory in Louisville is very gratifying. Booker Reed imagined himself a bigger man than the party to which ho owed allegiance and refused to submit to its action. Henry S. Tyler received the nomination and, although Hoed and hisaupporters made the bitterest kind of a fight, was elected by 'J,75S majority, and the other democratic were all, with few exceptions, elected. Louisville has proved again that sho is democratic to tho coro nnd that bolters stand no show whatever. Thk Senate by a strict party vote of -11 to 30 took up the Force bill and agreeable to an order of the caucus will press it fo a final vote, even if tho rules will have to bo changed to do so. Tho lesson of the late election seems to have been lost on the conspirators, who aro moro than ever determined to punish the people for their insolence in condemning their par tisan actions. Let them do their worst. A reckoning day is coming and as sure as the Bible is true they will reap the whirlwind from the wind they aro sowing. Thk Henderson Howa, which for 27 years has been conducted and edited by Mr. Benjamin Harrison, announces in the current issue that it will appear no more. It is understood that Mr. Harrison will go to Bowling Green, to which place n stock company has invited him, and start a morning daily. Tho Kentucky Press Association, of which for so many years he has been the honored and honest treasurer, will wish him success even beyond his expectations. Thk Louisville Post made n gallant fight for its candidate, Booker Reed, and but for its bad break in publishing an edition on election day asserting that he was elected, its country cousins might havo continued their confidence in its reliability, if they had grown suspicious of its judgment.

The con. con. is off on another junket, this time to Richmond. Tho body is making a record that even tho last legislature would blush to acknowledge. McDermott's amendment providing that constitutional amendments must he approved by a majority of one-fourth of the total number of voters of tho State was adopted. The convention has decidod that a constitutional amendment before coming effective must bo approved by j of both branches of tho legislature ami then he submitted to tho people at two different elections and ho ratified at both. Tho popular vote at the latter must exceed of the total number of votes cast at the election last preceding. The Lexington Lender says: Tho stenographer receives for his services 550 a pay for 5 days of the week and S35 per day for tho other two days. This makes a total of 3-'0 per week, or Sl.'.'SO per month. That otlicinl, according to good I authority, pays out to his assistant $-1 17 j per month, which leaves him a net balance of $333. This is gouging tho State! ' pretty heavily to perpetuate speeches, many of which are tho veriest rot, of1 which tho makers will themselves be ashamed before many years. Mr. Miller's proposition to abolish the office of commonwealth's attorney and require county attorneys to prosecute all criminal case3 was defeated in the convention, the more's the pity. The commonwealth's attorney is at the same time the most useless and the best paid officer in tho State, and Mr. Miller's proposition to do away with him would have met with better Buccess but for Mr. Bronston, who seems to he the especial champion of such attorneys, and intention of the rest of the opponents not to abolish a single office, but create as manv more as possible. At present commonwealth's attorneys cost the State $110,000 a yearand they do less than can bo accomplished by county attorneys, who are as a general thing just as capable and necessarily better acquainted with the cases.
