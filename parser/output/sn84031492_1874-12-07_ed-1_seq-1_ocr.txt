PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. EXPECTED RECOMMENDATIONS. Special Dhvalch to The Chieaao Tribune. Washington, D. 0., Dec. o.—Tho expected recommendations of tho President's tucssaire with regard to specie payments have boon very gouoially discussed by Congressmen. A promi nent Western Congressman, who is in favor of specie payments, states to-night that tho Presi dent's message in this respect is likely to bo a fire-brand, uud an Eastern Representative, who claims that his district contains as many pro nounced iQßumpUonistß as any district in tho country, and who himself has uniformly voted against any increase of currency, says that, while ho favors any legislation tending to tho gradual 

RESUMPTION OP SPECIE PAYMENTS, bo would not undertake to assume tho responsi bility of attempting to llx any given immediate day for resumption. Those expressions are a typo of representatives of tuo hard-money class in extreme sections of thccouutry. The general dvilt of discussion, even with those who favor .com payment, is against any legislation which shall fix a day for resumption at any time within the Administration of President Grant. There is A 

PRONOUNCED UNWILLINGNESS, even among some of those who arc tho strongest advocates of specie payments, to attempt at present to fix any day when loaumplion shall mgin. Others, who avo more positive in their desire for speedy resumption, of which class Judeo Hoar, of Massachusetts, is a typo, are in favor of fixing a day, and are willing that that day shall bo as early as Jau. I, 1377. The indications, from a partial canvass of tho House, are that a bill cannot pu>s which will fix a day of resumption at any period as early as that named. This is tho opinion, even, of conservative men. It is given out to , night, but not oa authority, that tho President ! has decided to 

REVISE THE FINANCIAL SECTIONS of hie message, and, while making strong rec ommendations in favor of fixing some early day for resumption, will not iu his racadago name such a day. Qon. Bristow, in his report, will, it is understood, refer to this unwllhguoca to llx a definite time as one of tho greatest obstacles in tho way of resumption. It is manifest that a majority of tho House Committee on Banking ami Currency, to which the President's recom mendations would bo referred, is opposed to fix ing a date for resumption. 

CONDITION OF THE SOUTH. The President, it is believed, will devote & con siderable portion of his message to a statement of the condition of tho Sonth, and a recital of tbo evidouco which led to tho movement of troops in some of tbo Southern Stales during tho last summer. The reports of army ofilcers, and other otUclal evidence, will be cited as the basis of this action of tbo President as a proof of tho opera tions of the White League, particularly in Louis iana and Alabama. (To the Aenocinteil PrerntA NOT 

QUITE COMPLETF.D. Washington, D. C„ Doe. C.—Tho President's message is not vot quite completed, owing to delay m receiving tho report of tho District of Columbia Commlsuiouore, a reference to which will be added to tho message to-morrow morn ing. Although tbo 'President has shown the message to no person other than members of the Cabinet and copyists, there is tho best rea son lor bolioving it will 

CONTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY THE FOLLOWING POINTS, founded on expressions of tho President to m timato friends since the message was submit ted 1.0 and cordially indorsed by tho Cabinet oa Friday last. The President says that allbougu be did not commence tho preparation of his message until a week-ago yesterday, some of tho newspapers had previously prognosticated its contents, although ho had consulted nobody as to wbat it should contain. Tboro is no doubt tho message will stato that OUR 

RELATIONS WITH ALL FOREIGN POWERS ARE FRIENDLY and without disturbance, though there Is an un settled question wilh Venezuela, which has not yet paid tho awards of tho Joint Commission under the Convention of 1863. Congress, it will be recollected, strongly expressed Its sense ou this subject in February, 1678. Tho President in his message of lust December said there was reason to bolievo that tho hesitancy of that Republic in recognizing tho claims sprung in part, at least, from a real dilficulty iu discharg ing them in connection with its obligations to other Governments, and, therefore, the expedi ency of further forbearance on tho part of our Government was Ijoliovcd to bo worthy of the consideration of Congress. In addition to Youo faola, we havo 

UNSETTLED QUESTIONS WITH SPAIN, growing out of the uifalr of tho Virginias, and other grievous transactions on tho part of tho Spanish authorities in connection with events m Cuba. The magnitude of tho offenses has net been reduced since the President's previous message a year ego. This unsettled condition of affairs in Cuba cannot tong continue. It may become necessary for other nations, with our own to Interfere to terminate tho insurrection which has so long prevailed, the Spanish Government having unsuccessfully attempted tu suppress it. Meantime tho commerce of all countries, and especially that of tho United States, suffers, tho Hags of tho United States and England having boon insulted, Tho Pres ident, in conversation, although ho docs notstato , tbo fact m hla message, says tho United States , purchase about 80 por oont of tho Cuban exports, , and therefore tbo duties paid by American oil izeus contribute to this extent iu helping Spain to continue TUB WAR 

AGAINST THE INSURGENTS. The Picuidout had hoped that by tho meeting of Congress to-morrow tho present negotiations with Spain would bavo been oudod, but in this ho ban boon dUappoluted. Ho, therefore, Bays iu bln message httlo or nothing about indemnity, ponding negotiations, but at a future tlmo will present the subject to tho special consideration of Congroßß. TUB 

POSITION or THE PRESIDENT Olf THE FI NANCIAL QUESTION Ih practically ns follows: Notwithstanding former speculations of those who spoko without authority, he desires and will recommend tho resumption of speoio payments at tho earliest practicable day. But ho does not behove this can bo tonohod ns soon oa the Ist of January, 1870. lie does not name any day, loaviug Con gress to devise moans to secure the desired end, it being tho duty of Congress to do bo. Tho legal-lender clause of tho-Curronoy act should bo repealed, to tube effect as to contracts mado alter a day to bo fixed by law for Its repeal, Power should bo given to tho Heoiolury of tho Trra uirv to obtain gold from and after the date fixed for tho resumption or specie payments by tbo issuance of bonds. In addition to this, tho rovouuoß of tho Ouvorumont should bo in cxccso of tbo expenditures. To support resump tion, gro&tor econoiny should b’o practiced in all departments of tho Government, and, if nocos nary, tho customs aud internal rovonuo laws changed-to secure larger amounts of rovonuo. With a joturu of specie payments 

UANKINT) SHOULD BE FREE. Tho bill-holders should continue to bs protect ed ah nt proHuut under tbo banking law. Thera should bo dj limitation to tho volume of cur rency, os tho community 'itself should deter mine what amount is required f»r business transactions, instead of leaving tho Executive, Secretary of tho Treasury, and Congress to fix a limit. It would bo tho duty of Congress, how ever, to mako regulations regarding free hanks of issue, and to state conditions on which tkoy can ho organized and transact business, tho legislation to bo in accordance with tho now or der of things; or, In other worde. tho resump tion of specie payments. There should bo NO MONOPOLY by fixing tbo amount of innno. Tho President will recommend that Congress do not interfere with the present Currency act, passed during last session, unless to amend it so as to conform with a plan for the resumption of specie payments. The President will make no recommendation oa tbo subject of internal improvements by tho General Government,[but will mocolyrofor to tho fact that Congress has already appointed a com mittee on transportation routes to the seaboard, which has already made its report, and will give further information from moro recent investiga tions, Tho President devotes much space to 

AFFAIRS IN ARKANSAS, giving the reason why bo declined to interfere in t lie recent dilUoultiea in that State,and he adverts to tho facts narrated in Ids special message to Congress in February, 1873, relative to Louisiana, in which no said ho hud uo speoitio recommenda tion to make on tho subject, but if there w ere any practical way of removing those difficulties by legislation then ho earnestly requested that tho question might bo taken up at that session of Congress. Ho was extremely an dms to avoid any pretense of unduo interference in State affairs, and if Congress dif fered with him as to what ought to be done, he requested its immediate decision to that effect. Otherwise, ho should foci obliged, as far as ho could by tho oxorciso of legitimate authority, to :nt an end to the unhappy controversy which disturbed tho pence and prostrated tho business of Louisiana by tho recognition and SUPPORT «F THAT GOVERNMENT which was recognized and uphold by tho courts of tho State. It sc >med advisable that ho should state which course ho should fool bound to pursue in reference to tho matter In thoovencof no action being taken by Con gress at that time, but subject to anysatisfactory arrangements that might bo made by tho parties to the controversy, and which of all * things was most desirable. It would bo his duty, so far as it might bo necessary for him to act, to acihero to tho Government heretofore recognized by him. Tho President again submits this question to Congress, nud will continue to act as ho has heretofore acted relative to the af fairs of Louisiana, unless otherwise controlled by Congress. The President reiterates his con fidence in THE 

INDIAN PEACE POLICY. If adhered to. bo says, it will produce additional bonolici.il results, and ultimately free tho iron* tier of Indian depredations. Ho alludes to CIVIL-SERVICE REFORM, savin? it tins bvon mi closely adhered to as the opposition manifested against'it permitted. Its results have boon bonoliolal, having elevated tho capacity mid tooo of tho appointmenta in tho several Departments of the Government, but it would bo impossible to oontiuuo tho reform with* out direct support of Congress, sanctioned by the people, Tho .President alludes to the reports of ibo bonds of tho several Departments which accom pany tho message, and calls attention to their respective recommendations. Ho again rec'mi mouch the passage of a law establishing a court lor tho adjudication of THE 

CLAIMS OP ALIENS against the Govormuont, a bill for this purpose having been introduced by Judge Lawrence at the previous session of Congress, The President does not ailudo to UTAH AFFAIRS, tho subject being loft open for future considera tion. Ho culls attention to the fact that CHINESE IMMIGRANTS continue to be brought to this coumry under tbs condition of slaves, according to contract, and also women whoso character is nuou as to de moralize tho communities u\ which they avo located, ile invites legislation on this subject, saying it will bo bis pleasure, us well as duty, to enforce any law on tho subject. THE 

NAVY. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY* Warhinoton. D. C., Dec. 'C.—Tho annual re port of tho Secretary of tho Navy has been sub mitted to tho President. It shows tho nary to Do in a remarkably ofHoiout condition, both as regards ibo number of vessels and their arma ment and sea-going qualities. The navy at pres ent consists of 163 vessels, with 1.351 guns. Of iron-clad or annorod vessels, 10 aro of a class and in condition for actual and efficient service. Four others, of tho class of powerful doublo turreted monitors, aro actually on hand under going repairs, and a tilth m well worth the satno attention, but tho remainder may bo counted as 

REALLY USELESS for any active and elUciout purpose. Ono-lmlf of the stcum navy adapted to cruising is in commission and in actual service. This number of vessels cannot be prudently diminished j but, if it is to bo maintained, there must bo a gradual ami constant addition to tho navy to supply tho places of thuso which arc each your found to bo worn out and untie for further sorvico, ami for this purpose a llxod amount for tonnage should bo built every roar. Tills tonnage may bo small, but it should bo CONSTANT AND UNFAILING, To thin ond the Department has accumulated a largo amount of live-oak timber iu various navy yardu, whore it will yearly improve in condition and bo available as the very best material fortho frames of any ships it may at any tiuo bo neces sary or desirable to build. The rapid and almost complete disappearance of this most valuable ship-lumber from our shores, large quantities boiug sent abroad, should arrest tbo attention of Congress, and measures should bo taken TO SECURE WHAT REMAINS, The Secretary recites tho foots in the Virginlus affair, ami refers to the yellow-fovor epidemic at Pensacola end tho ureat naval trial off tho coast of Florida. Iln recommends that, if the Ice landic Committee sent out In a Government vessel to examine several points on tho Alaska coast with a view to settlement by their country* men shall find at any point on tho Pucilio Coast n satisfactory location, that whatever assistance tho Government is competent to extend toward establishing AN ICELANDIC COLONY there be promptly offered, as the Icelanders would bo a valuable and fruitful source of supply to tho naval service of trained American seamen In time of need. The Secretary calls attention to tho importance of the Hydrographic office. Ho thinks special attention should bo given to surveys of the North Paoilio Ocean, and urges the propriety of increasing and developing the resources of tho navy yards.. Tlioapproptiations applicable to ffsoal year ending June HO, 1671, including the UNEXPENDED BALANCE of appropriation* for tho building of now sloops, and special appropriations to reimburse the bureaus lor their great expenditures during tbo threatened complications with Spain, amount ed in the aggregate to $37,117,657, and the ac tual expenditures for tho same period from thesa appropriations amounted to 8x6,254,165, or about $80(1,000 loss than than the whole CHICAGO, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1874. amount. Tho appropriations made availa ble for iUo current year, commencing July 1, 1871, amount id thu aggregate to $15,278,701.

LOUISIANA. A MEMORIAL TO CONOREBS. Special Dispatch to The Chicago Tribune, Washington, D. 0., Deo. G.— Tho Louisiana ItopnbUciiMH will to-morrow present to Congress a memorial asking for tho passage of a resolu tion approving tho decision and action of the President on tho status of Louisiana. Tho memorial sots forth that tho Republican party in Louisiana is not, through tho present State Gov ernment, tho party organization, or Itsindlvidual members, responsible for tho civil disorders in tho Slate. Tho mombors of this party aro loyej to tho National and State Governments, peace able and law-abiding, and for tho moat part agri culturists and laborers, whose callings and in terests 

DEMAND PEACE AND ORDER. “ The present State officers wore elected at the time fixed by law in 1872, for four years, and tho Stoto Government was regularly inaugurated. Two sessions of the Legislature, completing tho term of the members elected in 1872, have been hold, and have enacted tho necessary laws. Tho President reaognizod this State Government, and tho highest Judicial tribunal in tho State, as well as tho inferior ones, have 

RECOGNIZED ITS LEGALITY. A now House of Representatives has been elect ed, and will commence its session and convene according to law on the first Monday of January. 1875, next. This State Government has reduced tho State debt more than $1,000,000, and has re duced State taxation from 21% to 14% mills on tho dollar, audio urging additional financial re forms. Tbo memorialists say: "The Demo cratic party, composed almost ostirolv of white men, aod mainly of tho old Rebel element,- have over since tho War waged an unrelenting and aggressive opponition AGAINHT THE UNIOK MEN of tho South ami those who have immigrated there ainoo tho War. This spirit was manifested against the whito Bopublicans bo foro tho colored roou acquired tho elective franchiao, as wiluonhod in 1805, 18C0, and 1807, which opposition has boon iutooHiilod einco tho colored mon acquired the elective franchiao. Tho Whito League, through armed organiza tions, have forced district aud parish officers to abdicate tlioir offices, and aro uow individually, ou tho streets and through thoir newspapers, threatening ths legal Roiuruing Board of the State and tho persons tho Board may return elected, unless they return those whom tho Whito League claims as elected, wmi DEATH. Tho State laws and authorities aro utterly dis regarded in all things whoa they stuud in tho way of obtaining those ends, and tho United States laws and authorities aro. equally disre garded when there is not a forco present to on iorco thorn. Tho armed organization of the While League is kept up, and is daily drilling, and tho United States authorities arc threatened with resistance if they attempt to oppose this action of tho Whito Longue. In short, an armed revolution is preparing and already exists in Louisiana, composed of tho minority against tho majority, aud against tho legally organized government of tiro State, *' Tho memorialists claim that tho passage of this resolution would prevent further violence end quell a turbulent element in the State, consisting entirely of Dem ocrats. THE 

INFLATIONISTS. PENNSYLVANIA KELLEY ABPIKEB TO OB THEIR LEADEB. Special DitpaMi to Tiif Chicago Tribun*, Washington, Doc. 6.—llopiosomativo W. D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, bits taken a very decided public position with respect to tho uew Western foliation movement, and ovkl.uily aspires to be come tho loader of tho luilutiouiets iu the next House without regard to party affiliation. In answer to a letter from T. B. Buchanan, Secre tary of the National Executive Committee of tho Indianapolis inflation party, iu which THE VIEWS OF KELLEY concerning tins movement arc requested, Judge Kelley will say: “If tho message of tbePiusi dcut aud the report of the Secretory of the Treasury coruam|BUch propositions, as we are told they will, with respect to a speedy resumption of specie payments, aud tho Itopublican party ac cept them, I shall in so tar 00-operato with those who oppose such legislation. I have carefully considered your BASIS OF UNION, and may say that I have long believed, and for some years ouforcod, tho doctrine that it is tho duty of tho Government to iesuo tho money of the country end to prohibit the circulation of notes of corporations, whether State or nation al, aud that the money so issued shall bo the legal lender for all duos, public and private, in cluding duties on imports. In this I agreed with Xhadduus Stevens as early as 1802." PROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION. TUB DISTRICT GOVERNMENT. Special Dispatch to Tho Chicaao Wbunt, Washington, D. 0., Doc. G.—-The bill for a form of government for the District covers one hundred pages of legal-cap. It will ho presented to the Sonata to-morrow. The Committee are quite sanguine that it will provide a Government which will moot all tho requirements of the case. BEOUOANIZATIOH OF THE TREASURY DEPART- The House Committee on Civil-Service Deform has completed, and will bring before the House at an early day for action, tho bill for tho entire reorganization of tho Treasury Department. This hid makes a change in tho existing organization, and will provide for a more ofllciont service at Joss expense. Tho Treasury Department is now organized as it was in tho War time, and a portion of its machinery is obsolete mid uuadupted to tbo present methods of business. TUB 

GENEVA AWARD DILL will again come up for lliml adjustment, but It is stated that tho contest between tho war-premium claimants and tUo insurance interests is ended. The rival parties, who bad each a powerful legal lobby last winter, Uft vo. it is understood, agreed upon a compromise, the substance of which is that a bill shall bo presented which will permit the insurance companies to receive all the funds which shall bo awarded, npon tho condition that, subsequently, a pro-rata division shall bo made with tuo war premium claimants. Tho condi tions of this division are not known. CHEAP TRANSPORTATION. It Is predicted by members of tho House Com milieu on Transportation that the McCrary bill has uo chance of passage iu the Senate, and that there is but little prospect that tho bill to pro vide for a double-track through-freight railroad from the West to tbo seaboard can secure a ma jority iu either House. The bouoto Transporta tion Committee will oudoavor to bring tho Senate to on early consideration of the Wiudom report, The House Committed on flanking and Cur rency have already held a preliminary meeting and had an interchange of views. Some of tho members of tho Committee are of tho opinion that there will be no iluauoiai legislation this season. NEWSPAPER-POSTACH.

It is recommended that $16,000 be appropriated to rebuild the station, which is a very Important one. as it Is a guide to tho whole commerce of the lakes through Lake St. Clair and the Detroit llivur. The recommendation which has been made In several annual reports to build a coast light to divide the long distance of 15 miles between Point Aux Barques and Fort Gratiot Is renewed. This lighthouse would be one of tho coast-lights of tho general system, and it Is not intended lu serve any focal Interest. An appropriation of SIO,OOO is recom mended for this purpose. The recommendation con tained iu the last four unntmi reports that a lako coaet iight be established on Undue I'oint, Lake Michigan, Wl«„ Is renewed aud su appropriation of $10,001) rec ommended. Tue survey of Stannard's Rock, Lake Superior, Mich., was made as provided for by act of Congress of MurcU 3, 1873. The results of the survey of this dan- Serous rock show that it Is practicable to build a light ouso, to mark it, lu water varying from 10 to 12 feet, aud approachable from three bides. This house should be built, aud a fog signal also erected. This rock ilea near the track of all the vessels running to the north side and western portion of Lake Superior, and Is au object of great anxiety, especially In dark nights, and tho almost Interminable fug which prevails in that neighborhood during tho greater part of tho season of navigation. Ihe keeper of Mnnltnu Island reports only five days during the whole mouth of Juno, lb7l, when there was no fog la that vicinity. Tho construction of this station will beiiellt the largo, growing, sod valuable commerce of tho Lake Superior region. This la tho proper time to Lo gin It. because it can now be built cheaper than at any future time, for the reason that (bo costly apparatus and machinery used at Spectacle Reef aro now avail able, aud are especially adapted to works such as this, Tho work Is nearly 20 miles distant from tho neatest laud, and 10 miles from a suitable harbor, and, ss It will bo placed in from 10 to 12 foot of water, U will re quire a structure of the most costly and substantial character. It will cost at least $300,000, but no accu rate detailed estimate can bo given lu advance, Large os this sum Is, its outlay IsfaDy warranted by (ho uc- Ci’Bbltlos of tho navigation of tho lakes, and therefore au appropriation of $200,000 is recommended to begin work.

REFORMED EPISCOPAL. Bishop Cheney Tells the Story of Ita First Yotvr. Yesterday being tho first Sabbath following tho first anniversary of the birth of tho Re formed Episcopal Church, Bishop Cheney dis coursed to a congregation at Christ Church, comer of Michigan avouuo and Twenty-fourth street. After tho usual announcements, and tho singing of tho Twooty-oightU hymn, tho Bishop selected his text ns follows: There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon tbo top of (ho mountains ; the fruit thereof shall nh::ko lll:e Lebanon, nmlthoy of tho city shall flourish like grass of tho earth.— Da. Ixxxii., IS. Tho Bishop began bis discourse by saying tboro are some psalms of David that flash upon the ear like tbo wail of an Eolian harp ; but this is like the clash of cymbals, tbo sound of trum pets, ana the shouts of tho multitude when tho conqueror returns from a victory. This was doubtless ono of tho later compositions of Da vid, and an unseen baud led the aged minstrel up to a Plsgob height of inspiration. Liko Ho bos beyond death's Jordan, bursts tbo glory of the kingdom. Tbo wbolo psalm, bo said, was glowing with gorgeous richness of color like ono of Leonardo da Vinci’s paintings. The tropic fervor of tbo Oriental imagination, tbo bound less wealth of a poetic fancy, wore exhausted, to supply figures adequate to represent (be splen dors of that future monarchy. But whoso kingdom was it, ho 'asked, what people was it, whoso prosperity prompted such strains of antlcipatlvo rejoicing? 'What ruler was ho, yot to come, whoso tbrono should bo based on such pillars of justice, nud bo tbo centre of sucb power, that tbo awe felt by his enemies was ouly equaled by tbo loving devotion of bis subjects? Tbo Bishop boro drew a beautiful imaginary picture, end said, in tho chill of an autumn morning he looked down from the highest point of a mountain range, and plainly sought to pierce tho mist of tho valley bououth him. Suddenly an un seen power rent it asunder, aud a vision of beauty mot his eager gaze. Tho co lay a peaceful village *, while cot tages shone out from among tbo trees; acburch aniro pointed heavenward, from the coutro of the hamlet, girded with human hahitotions; there were pastures dotted with nerds; yellow Holds stood tuick with sheaves of tho harvest. Not a ripple of displeasure could bo seen amongst the villagers; what a beautiful eight it was! IVhat village was it ? Who wore tiro dwellers lu that peaceful pastoral scene? The mist, ho said, settled over it attain, and loft his questions un answered. Perhaps a similar uncertainty bangs over the vision which this psalm reveals. Tbo Bishop referred to tbo reign of Bolomon, —tbo " Golden Ago "of tbo Jewish Empire. Ho said tho wisdom of Bolomon, tho wealth aud splendor of his Empire, wore to this day tbo burden of tbo Jewish tradition. Was it any woudor that God permitted David to write of this wonderful Kingdom, its glorious and magnificent power ? Yot after all, ho said, no man can read tho Psalms without feeling that tbo application to Israel’s wise King docs uot exhaust tboir fullness. The Disbon, in referring to tho work of tbo Deformed Episcopal Church for tbo past year, said from out tbo well they bad drawn a bucket bf water, but fathomless depths wore yot loft; they had, indeed, climbed up a few rounds of tho ladder, but its summit was lout in tbo clouds. Ho said that David, in wilting, carved tbo image of tbo kingdom of his son, but Ood guided him. Tho text, ho said, is but ono stroke of tbo chisel; its ono idea is tbo thought that from tbo feeblest instru mentalities grand and magnificent results might bo achieved. Ho quoted from I. Corinthians, i., 27-28; " But God has chosen tbo foolish things of the world to oonlound tbo wise; and God hath chosen tbo weak things of tho world to confouud tbo things which are mighty; oud base things of tbo world, and things which are despised, bath God chosen, yea, aud tbiuga which are uot to bring to naught things that are.” Last Wednesday was tbo birth-day anni versary of tbo Deformed.Episcopal Church, and to-dav they gathered around tbo child measured by a single year. Tho second day of December, 1873, was to them a memorable ono; it was what tbo Fourth of July was to tho Nation. On this nearest Buudav to tho anniversary of tbo organization, let them return thanks giving ; lot tbo toxt bo tboir guide. 110 would bo disappointed if they did uot Oud that tbo De formed Episcopal Church already bore marked evidence that it sbarod this essential feature of tbo Kingdom of Josus Christ,—that they who went forth weeping, bearing precious seed, wore now reaping tbo harvest tborofrom. Tbo toxt suggmlod a scantiness of seed in sowing time. Ho compared it to tho story how, under the shadow of the ruined mill where Louis XVI. played at tbo miller trade, sheaves of wheat wore garnered from a few grains dropped. Ho once picked up a tiny thing, a broken root of iyy. without a particle of its native soil, and after mouths of travel carried it boms aud f laced it in tbo greenhouse of a friend, whore bo poor, withered, lifeless thing, hardly worth attomptiug to revive, had grown into a whole generation of young ivies. Had it fionshea there would have been no groat lamon aliens, it was true, but it would have spoiled a bit of sentiment, and broken the thread of his toric association, but no more serious con sequence could have resulted. The Bishop also referred to the devastation caused by tbo hordes of insects within tbo past few months in tho States of Kansas and Nebraska, and added that a few grains of seed corn wore with those people a question of life and death. Beauty seed meant slender harvest. Bueb was tbo picture that tbo toxt sug gested. Bowiug-tima had now come ; the earth waited for tho seed to bo intrusted to it; wide fields wore ready, but tbo husbandman bad ouly "a handful of corn to oast upon the earth. He felt tha* ••very man who took part in tho or ganization of the Deformed Episcopal Church felt that they wore reproducing just that scone which tbo i’salmist described. They wore tbo sowers of tbo seed; they wore hut tbo nucleus ; a mere handful on tbo earth : hut. liko tbo seed sown, they would increase until the Deformed Episcopal Church would widely grow in strength. Tho earth was before them. Tbo seed of tho movement was only a handful. He had soon land-slides, when half of a groat hill swept down tho heights ; lie had soon a chasm where mountains were deft, Such a separation was that when tho Presbyterian Church parted asunder. Buch a ujuvoinont was that when Blavory rout in twaiu the Methodist Church. This, movomont was nothing of that kind. They did not claim they were the Episcopalians; they had not divided the Church any more than tho Apostles had divided the Jewish Church. In their ilrf* Coun cil no ono organized church was the** repre- NUMBER JU7. sentod; there were few present to talro it la 11 % r i°. XiM Rn aggregation of indi vidual#, but tho Boformors wore acluallv fear m numbers. Tlio meeting was called for the ball of tbo Young Men's Christian Assocl ation In Now York City, but aa tbo hour drew near they changed to tbo parlors of tbo aamo bmldbig. At tbo appointed litno tbo apartment# wore crowded, but who woro they? They word ministers, saoromoularian sobool students, Dr. Seymour, afterwards elected Bishop of tbo DU occso of Illinois; editors of tbo High Church Press, and others, until they, tbo Boformors, wore almost lost in tbo crowd, and when only six clergymen, besides Bishop Cummins, gave la their adhesion, they woro mat with sneers, 111- suppressed laughter, and scorn. Tho laity wa# represented in greater force, but still they woro a moro handful. They looked in vain for tbo loaders of tbo evangelical party. Frederick tbo Groat in bis first battle fiod under the cover of darkness, and loft tbo troops bo bad marshaled, in front of tho onomy. They folt a# did Frederick's army. For twenty-five years bad tbo oldor men boon drilling tbo younger mem bers to bo ready for tho separation, which, sooner or later, must como; tboy baa clamored for revision, and demanded right of recognition. Tboy bad asked for liborty to preach as they wished,' and for but ouo Bishop. But when tbo timo cams they deserted tho cause; they feared tholr names would bo bandied about through the pa pors. God, however, took them at their word; Ho gavo them ouo Bishop, and, with tboso sis cler gymen and tbo laity, tboy woro called upon to chooso between position, honor, and emolument, and abuso, persecu tion. and poverty. Tboy knew tbo result of that choice; they who woro gathered there s woro only a handful. Ho had no words of blamo ; ho only alluded to their actions. Scanty was the seed sown that day. Bishop Cummin# bad gono to work, bad stood like a rook, breast ing tbo contumely ond scorn of tbo people. Bravo indeed was tbo man ; ho was not ouloghs mg tbo Bishop, but no bravor man existed; no nobler act was never known than when Bishop Cummins cast asido bis rank and salary, ana o , friends except God, instead of going to this city Hector, and that Doctor of Divinity, or from this Theological Professor to that Bishop, and saying “ If you will move so will I,” went before tbo people ilko Abraham, with tbo moral grandeur of bis simple faith, and with no man pledged began bis good work. Bishop Cheney said ho was bis friend—bis bosom friend. God mono was a confidant of his hours of agonizing prayer. f i.ho text suggested that this scanty seed was sown in a most unfavorable soil. Tbo granary of tho world was Egypt, but Egypt was tho Val ley of tho Nile ; but tbo fields and prairies wore unbroken by au elevation. Tho richest soils whore grain germinated the most quickly were tho low alluvial lauds through which flowed the Ohio and tho Missouri Bivors. But olimb with him tho mountain heights; how fow wore the harvest fields as they ascend. Bocks thrust out their ugly faces ; water-worn stones strewed tho slopes, no blades of grass between them. Now tboy stand upon tho summit. The very Sines woro stunted; scanty mosses woro seen ore and there, and tbo very earth seemed swept away. No husbandman would scorn so dement ed as to sow his grain on tho granite shoulder# of Whitofaco or the Shasta. Tills text presented a strange picture. As If it were not enough misfortune to sow with a more "handful of corn,” it is sown on "top of the mouutaiua. Tho Bishop hero said there was no mistaking tho meaning of tbo words. It clearly suggested, not only that they who formed tbo nucleus of a great movement would always bo a “handful” only, but also that, under most onparontlyunfortuuato circum stances, tho fruit thereof shall shako like; Leb anon. The Deformed Episcopal Church was no exception to tiie rule. Tho time was ill-suited, os tho noil would bo. Tho •* mountains ” were unfavorable so far as tbo Church was concerned. Did they over moot a man who always postponed any personal reform till the beginning of tbo now year when bo would stop swearing or drop his intemperate habits ? Tho Hist Sunday of tho now year ho would bo regularly at church; but as each now year comes, ho inadvertently lot fall words of nroEaniiy; drank without thinking ; was ill, and thus kept from church. aud there fore concluded it was no use to begin until tho next now year. Bo with tho Evangelical Episcopalians. For a quarter of a century they have labored under a similar hallucination. The Qcuoral Convention mot ouco in throe years ; a panacea could always bo provided in tbo next General Convontipn. Then the bondage of canons would bo taken off $ tlioro would bo secured freedom in tbo use of the prayer-book; liberty to preach; tbo baptismal oflico lightened, and so on. All these blessings they were sure to got in tho next Qoneial Con vention, and so thoy would wait for the next Convention. Bo it was with the Deformors. But tho ship was steadily nearing tbo port under tbo clarion call of Bishop Cummins. Notwithstanding they organized during tho financial panto ol last fail, when the millionaire of yesterday was a pauper to-day, they double-reefed their sails, and pre pared for economy. At such a crisis to start a now Church was to sow tbo last "baadfull of corn on top of the mountains.” Tbo toxt also suggested that neither scanty seed nor unfavorable soil aould prevent God’s blessing from giving a glorious harvest. What Niagara was to the American, tho heavy-headed Alps to the Hwiss, that was Lebanon to the ancient Jew. It was tbo grand natural wonder of Palestine. From the Syrian plains, from tbo heights of Mo&b, from tbo islands of tbo Medi terranean, old Lebanon gladdened his weary eyes. As another has said, 11 With a diadem of stars around bis snowy turban, bo seems the monarch of tho universe, bis bead In heaven, and his foot upon the sea.” Typo of all that was magnificent, the cedars made It also tho type of all that was fruitful and prolific. Beon from afar, waving in mountain winds, green forests seemed like vast fields of grain, or meadows watting for tho mower. Tbo Israelite could ash no bettor picture of promised harvest that that which compared them to the waving greenery of Lebanon. Nothing could stand In the way of God. Tbo past year had demonstrated tho truth. Tboir work demanded tbo concentration of every fac ulty. To-day was an epoch in tho history of their church. Look hack ’ at tbo path, every stop of which shined with heavenly mercy. They bad but a "handful”: thoy sowed it on tho "top of tho mountains,” but to-day "tbo fruit thereof shakes liko Leb anon.” Ono year ago they mot to lay tho foundation. Tlioro wore seven ministers, in cluding their beloved Bishop Gumming. Ho did not know the precise number of tho laitv who signed their declaration of independ ence, perhaps not moro than 120 men. Thoy had no ono organized congregation iu the land. Look what God had wrought: To day thoy had 40 ministers, 80 original churches, aud over 3,000 communicants knelt at tho com cmnion-tablo, and untold thousands were being reached by the Gospel from tbo Atlantia to tho Pacific, in tho West India Islands, and across tbs ocoau tho Froo Church of England woo gaining ground. Bishop Cummins wrote im that from tbo Bermuda Islands the people were writing him to send them Dofcrmea min isters. Ood had surely blessed them. Tbo Church to which thoy once belonged was shaken to lie very centre with DituaUsm, and he wished it was sacramoutariau instead. Never has he felt the f owor of infant baptism so much as since the Informed Church bad changed that service. There must be those who boro tho heat of tho service, but love’s labor kept them binding sheaves, aud with heroic will thoy bout to tho work, aud God knew tho grandeur thereof. At tho closo of tho sermon, a collection was taken up iu behalf of tbo poor. During the col lection camo the singing of tho offertory by the quartette quoir, composed of Mrs. Van Baboon hovon, Miss Die... Mr. Hunueman, and Mr. Loiler, which was very beautiful. Aftoi tbo col lection, Hie day being tho first Hunday iu tho mouth, the Holy Communion was celebrated.
