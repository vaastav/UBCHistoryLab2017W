N ( oMtrre-s in our time has done C(.ic u'"n,l work of importance than the i.ies-nt ( oii'Tcss, lhere were .... i u-vcral matters left unfinished at uuir ia-i m'i'mi. which x i ,.,k;v, t n;it earnestly hope you will com i.!ct before your adjournment. Corporation Campaign Contributions. 1 a-jaiii recommend a law prohib itinu all corporations from contribut ing to tiie campaign expenses of any party. Such a bilj has already past one Hons.- of (Congress, let individ uals contribute as they desire; but let n prohibit in effective fashion all forjH;iations from making contribu tions for any political purpose di rectly or indirectly. Government's Right to Appeal In Criminal Cases. Another bill which has past one House of the Corcgtess which it is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the Government the right of appeal in friminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the Congress. It u of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the defendant on the merits should be set aside. Re cently in one district where the Gov ernment had indicted certain persons for conspiracy in connection with re bates, the court sustained the defen dant's demurrer; while in another an i-idictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it and two defendants sentenced to im-' prisonment. The 'two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is unfortunate that there should even be an appearent conflict. At present there is no way by which the Government can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court and the wheels of justice are blocked without anv real decision of the ques tion. I can not too strongly urgj tbe passage of the bill in question. Setting Aside of Judgments ard Granting of New Trials. In connection with this matter, t would like to call attention to . ths yory unsatisfactory state of our crim inal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judg ments of inferior courts on technical ities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, and where there w no attempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial jus tice. It would be well to enact a law providing something to the effect mat 5"o judgment shall be set aside by uiai granted m any case, civil or criminal, or. che ground of misdi rection of the jury or ..the .improper -umMon or rejection , of evidence, or ior error as to any .matter of plead ing or procedure unless, "in" the opin ion ot the court to which the appli nation is made, after an examina tion of the entira cause, it shall aifir natively appear that the error com- r..u.u ui Has resulted in a miscar riage of justice. Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the V.aiuent ot a law m connection with me issuance of injunctions, attention Having been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right I aPPlS injunctions in labor cases Jtonld be wholly abolished.- It is at uouDUni whether a law abolish es auogetner the use of injunction .V such cases would stand the test of f01!1?;.1" which caS3 of courss "Ul "Ration-, would be ineffective .

Nation will add speed and certamiy ia the , execution WL ' ' WLen deal with neeessa- A i wau men inW- but the crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the per petration, especially by black men, of the hideon crime of rajie tbe most aboninable in all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs fr:quently avenge tbe commis sion of this crime by themselves tor turing to death the man committing it; thus avenging in bestile fashion a hostile deed, and reducing themselves to a level with .the criminal. Capital and Labor. In dealing with both labor and cap ital, with the questions affecting both corporations" and trades unions, there is one matter more important to re member than aught else, and that is the infinite harm done by preachers or' mere discontent. These are men who seek to exeite a violent class hat red against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper move ments for the better control of cor porations and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth, in to a campaign (f hysterical excite ment and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of mankind. The sinister demagogs and foolish visionaries who are always eager to undertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those working for a genuine reform in governmental and social methods, and sometimes masquarade as 'th-: reformers. In reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they pro fess to advocate, just as the purvey ors of sensational slander in news- paj)er of magazine are the worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad -in our social arid "governmental conditions. Railroad Employees' Hours and Eight Hour Law. I call your attention to the need of passing a bill limiting th'e number of hours of employment of railroad employees. The measure is a very moderate one and I can conceive of no serious opjection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should bs our aim steadily to reduce the nurB ber of hours of labor, with as a goal the general introduction of an eight -hour day. There are industries in which it is not possible that the hours of labor should be reduced; just a? there are communities not far enough advanced for such a movement to be for their good, or, if in the Tropics, so situated that there is no analogy between their needs and ours in this matter. On the Isthmus of Panama, for instance, the conditions are irl every way so different from vhaf they "are here that an eight hour day would be absurd ; just as it is absurd, so far as the Isthmus is concerned, where white labor can not be employ ed, to bother as to whether the neces sary work is done by alien black men or by alien yellow men. " But the wageworkers of the United States are of so high a grade that alike from the merely industrial standpoint and from the civic standpoint it should be our object to do what we can in the direction of seer ring the general observance of an eight hour day. Employers Liability. Among the excellent laws which th-e Congress past at the last session was an employers' liability law. It was marked step in advance to get the recognition, of employers' liability on the statuts books; but the law did not go far enough. In spite of all precau tions exercised by employers there ar unavoidable accidents and even deaths envolved in nearly every line of business connected with the me chanic arts. This is enevitable sacri fice of life may be reduced to a mini mum, but it can not be completely eliminated. Investigation of Disputes Between Captial and Labor. The commission appointed by thf President October 16, 1902, at the re quest of both the anthricite coal op erators and miners, to inquire into, consider, and pass upon the question. in . controversary in connection wit) .the strike in the anthracite regions 6i Pennsylvania and the causes out oi which the controversary arose, ir. their report, findings, and award ex prest the belief ".that the State and Federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be call ed the compulsory invesigation oi controversies-between employers- anl employees when they arise." Corporations. The present Congress has taken 4ong strides in the direction of secur ing: proper supervision and - contro by the National Government over corporations engaged in: interstate business and the enormous majority jof corporations of any size are engag ed in interstate business. The pas sage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passage of the pure ifood bill, and the provision for increasing and. rendering more effec tive national control over the beef packing industry, mark an important advace in the proper direction. Iu the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much further along this line ; and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to Urease their-scope, because only their merits and their shortcomings 9nH l 1. a . . iuus give opportunity lo ueunc what ; further remidial degislation' is needed. Yet in my judgment it will m the end be advisable in connection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting a date oh, tha label and for the packers. All these laws 'have already jutified their en aetment. - " ------ " ' . " Agriculture. Tbe only other persons whose wel- 1 fare is as vital to tbe welfare of the whole country as" is tbe welfare of : tbe wage workers are the tillers of tbe oil, the farmers. It i a mere trusim to say that rio growth of cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial de velopment can atone for any lalliuc off in the character and standing of the fanning imputation. Ihiring the last few decades this fact has be;n recognized with ever-increasing clear ness. v Marriage and Divorce. I am well aware of how difficult it 's to pass a constitutional amendment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relecated to the au thority of the National Congress. At present the wide difference in the laws of the different States on thu subject result in scandals and abuses: and surely there is nothing so vitally essential to the welfare of the nation, nothing around which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the average citizen. The change would be good from every standpoint. International Morality. On the question Of International mora'ity Mr. Roosevelt comes out strongly, advocating clean dealing be tween the nations of earth and also strongly advocates international arbi tration as a means of settling all dif ficulties that may arise. American Shipping. Let me once again call the atten tion of the Congress to two subjects concerning which I have frequently before communicated with them. One is the question of developing .Ameri can shipping. I trust that a law em bodying in substance the views, or a major part of the views, exprest in the report on ' this subject laid-beforo the House at its last session, will be past. I am Well aware that in former years objectionable measures have been proposed in reference to the en couragement of American shipping; but it seems to me that the proposed measure "is as nearly unobjectionable as any can be. Currency Reform. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great pur pose in aiding the enormous business development of the country; and within ten years there - liasr-been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.0S. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional legislation is needed. Our Island Possessions. It is urged that these shall receive the careful consideration of Congress and that tariffs, etc., shall be upon a just basis. Army and Navy. The message goes at length into tha matter of the efficiency of 'our 'army and navy. The PresUent is much gratified at the progress, .we are mak ing in both branches of our common defense. In the matter of rifle prac tice the President says: The Congress has most wisely pro vided for a National Board for the promotion of rifle practice. Excellent results have already come from this law, but it does not go far enough. Our Regular Army is so small that in any great war we should have to trust mainly to volunteers; and in such event these volunteers, should already know, how to shoot; for if a soldier has the fighting edge, and ability to take care of himself in. the open his efficiency on the line of bat tle is almost directly proportionate to excellence in markmanship. We should establish shooting gallaries in the large public and military schools, should maintain national target ranges in different parts of the coun try, and should in every way encour age the formation of rifle clubs throughout all parts of the land. The little Republic of Switzerland offers us an excellent example in all matters connected with building up an effic ient citizen soldiery. - "

The Senate received from President Roosevelt a long 'list of ap pointments for its confirmation, and in an executive session of 1! lninufes decided that as the nominations ha t been received before the body had been organized formally, to make n) confirmations uii.il the President's annual message had been received and the session fairly started. Seators Penrose of Pennsylvania, and Foraker, of Ohio, came forward with resolutions of inquiry regarding the discharge of the 11e4.ro 'loops ofH the Twenty-tilth Infantry. One wa addressed to the President and the other to the Secretary of War. Vice President Fairbanks suggested that it was unusual to transact any business untiTthe President's, message had been received and the resolutions "went over,'' by unanimous consent. Senator Dupout, of Deleware, took the oath of office. The opening of the two Houses was witnessed by an animated throng, which filled the galleries to their ca pacity. Hundreds went away disap pointed in not gaining admission to witness the session of either Senate or House. The following new members of the House presented their credentials and took the prescribed eath of office: W. F. Englebright, first district California; J. W.

Mann, of Illinois, a member of the board of regents of the ' Smithsonian Institute; vice Ro bert Hitt, of Illinois, deceased. The galleries of the House were croweded at an early hour The ab sence of flowers from the desks of the members was much commented on, but the order of the Speaker pro hibiting the floral display was gener ally commended for its good sense. A similar rule was made in the Sen ate two years ago. The presence of Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, daughter of tbe Presi dent, in the Executive gallery, accom panied by Miss Hasner, the social secretary7 of the wife of tha President gave the women in the galleries aa opportunity to observe the wife of the Representative from the vCinciu nati district at close range. The first work of the House inci dent to the opening day was quickly dispatched, the roll-call showing 300 present. After the appointment of the usu al committee to wait upon the Pres ident and inform him that the House was organized and ready to receive any communication he might desire to make of interest to the public ser vice, the House adjourned out of re spect to the memory of the deceased members, Surprise in The Senate.

PRES. SPENCER'S FUNERAL Kctable TrfbuUs Paid Distinguished Railroad Hagrutt by Associates. Statesmen and Ilea Eminent in all Walks of Life Every Train on Southern System Stopped for Flvt Minutes During Ceremony. Washington, Special. All that is mortal of Samuel Spencer, 1st pres ident of the Southern Railway, who, tragic death ou his own railroad on the morning of Th&nksgivin Day shocked the people of two hemis pheres, was laid to ret Sunday af ternoon in 'the receiving vault at Oak Hill Cemetery, there to await final disposition. A notable tribute wa paid to the memory of tbe distinguished railroad magnate by his associates, by states men and by men eminent in all the walks of public life. The funeral obsequies, held in historic St. John's Protestant Epixopal church, were at tended by railroad officials, finan ciers and public men from all parts of the country. At 2 o'clock the services began, and at the same instant throughout the system of railroads lately presid ed over by Mr. Spencer, every train came to a dead stop, every wheel ceased to turn, every employe put aside his work. For five minutes ov er the thousands of miles of railway every employe paid silent rcsject to the dead president. 

TRIBUTE TO SAMUEL SPENCER. Voting Trustees and Board of Direct ors in Joint Meeting Adopt Min utes to Be Printed in Press Along Route of Southern Railway. Washington, D. C, Special At u joint meeting of the voting trusteed of the board of directors of the South ern Railway Co., held at its office the following minute was adopted to be entered on the records and pub lished at length in the press upon, the lines of the Southern Railway: ' Samuel Spencer, born in Colum bus, Ga., March 2, L847, died Nov. 29, 1906, near Lawyers Station, Vir ginia, upon the railroad of the South ern Railway Company, of which he was the first and only president. The personal qualities of Mr. Sjencer; his integrity in heart and mind;. his affectionate, and genial, . disposition ; his loyal aud courageous spirit; his untiring devotion to duty; his pre sistent achievement of worthy ends; and his comradeship on the field ot battle of affairs and of manly spoit combined to establish him in the lov ing regard of hosts of friends in ev ery section of his country, and no where more securely than in the af fection of his fellow-workers m the service of the Southern Railway Com pany. The importance of his service to this company is a matter of com mon knowledge throughout the rail road world; but the character, the ex tent, and the consequence of that service are and can be appreciated at their full worth only by his associates now gathered here to attest their re gard for him and to record their high estimate of his life and work. "Upon June 18th, 1894, on the completion to the Richmond terminal, a re-organization conceived by J. Pi erpont Morgan and conducted by hi3 partner, Charles H. Coster, the first meeting of the Southern Railway- Company was called to order at Rich mond by Samuel Spencer as presi dent. In that calendar year, the Southern Railway Company embrac ed 4,391 miles of road, with 623 lo comotives and 19,C94 cars, which car ried 3,427,858 passengers and 6,673, 750 tons of freight and earned $16, 643,298. In the last fiscal year, the Southern Railway system embraced 7,515 miles of road with 1,429 loco motives snd 42,110 cars, which car ried 11,663,550 passengers and 27, 339.337 tons of freight, and earned $53,641,438. The number of em ployes had increased from 16,718, June 30th, 1895, to 37,003 June 30th, liK)6, and the wages paid from $6, 712,796 to $2i;i89,020. The full de tails and impressive character of this remarkable advent, too extended for present recital, are exhibited in the masterly eommunciation which upon February 1. 3900, Mr. Spencer ad dressed to Mem-s. J. P. Morgan & Co., as the basis of the development and tencral mertiraire. "In this progress every step had been initial and conducted by Mr. Spencer with the cordial concurrence of the voting- trustees and the board jaf-..directors, "and it is significant of tue conservative and cautioned po sition of Mr. fepei. cer and his sup porters, and thw r-rt nominal enlarge meui of the system and its business . . . .

Every dollar that could be bor rowed - under President Spencer's management was p-.it irto the proper ty in the effort to enable it to meet the" every increase in demands of the vigorous and wonderful growth of the South and its industries. ' The mighty fabrie, which for 12 years he had been molding, must continue un der others to develop and to improve in the service that shall render to the public, but never ean it cease to bear the - impress, or to reveal tne con tinuing impulse of the master mind of its first presidents In the height of his usefulness and his powers he atkra f the shicin cas!

He say everything there is apparent the beneficial effects of the execution of the law and a manifest desire on the part of the packers to comply with its provisions. In' some places new structures have replaced old ones and in other extensive improvements to the plants already established have been made so as to bring them up to he standard required by the meat in spection act for the health and com fort of the packing bouse employes. Dr. Melvm says there were some cases in which packers have proceed ed rather grudgingly in making the necessary improvements dut to the outlay of money required. Six Lives Lost in Fire.
