' 1 '- , .. ., A bill was passed by the House to : repeal the confiscation section of the " ' act of 1862, in regard to suppress ing insurrection, and was discussed at Borne' length on a motion of Mr Chandler to proceed to its considera tion. Mr. Chandler -reiterates the:" charge that a woman of questionable character had hawked pardons about . this city, giving as his authority a Judge of tne Supreme Court of this city and District.

' - ; '; Williams, of-Pennsylvania, moved : to reconsider the bill regulating ap pointments to office, which was re ported by him 'last season, and pro ceeded to state his reasons for ma king the motion at this time. The bill, he said.'Was of great importance. He discussed elaborately the policy which should govern appointments and removals from office, combating the idea that the President has, or ehonld have, a responsible power to appoint and remove ; : and quoting freely from ; political nd legal de cisions' in support Of his position.' Adopted.- . ' i i i : 'i .v; : - . Williams, . of Pa., moved to' recon sider tbe bill regulating appointments to office, reported by him at the last session.!.. He then proceeded to. argue in favor 6f the bill.' It rested, he said, on the hypothesis that the power of removal did: not rightfully' belong to the President alone under the Con stitution, and that it could ' not be safely left with him without restraint upon its exercise, and this upon a. general principle and without any reference to the merits or demerits of the existing functionary. It aimed at the reformation of a great vice in the administration of the Government by, bringing its practice back to the true spirit and meaning of the fundamental law. : In-doing so, it, disturbed no principle and attacked no judicial pre-, cedent. It contemplated merely a re view of the Legislative opinion of yes-: terdayi and it was not jhe ;flrst time : that opinion had been questioned. It had been anticipated by a denial of - an authoritive, . character it was i the opinion of- a divided court, andi it, was not even old enough to be venerable; but to esti mate justly the weight to which it was, entitled, it would be necessary to ; state its precise extent and the cir cumstances by which it was sustained. It was noted that while those who were opposed to the adoption of the Constitution, had objected . that it would give to the President the ex ecutive powers of a King. Not even the advocates of its adoption claimed that it was intended to give him the eminently kingly power of removing ' the other officers of the Government at his own will.
