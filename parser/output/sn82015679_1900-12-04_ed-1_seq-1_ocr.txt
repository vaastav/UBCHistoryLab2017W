WASHINGTON. Dec. 2. The final ses sicn of the Fifty-sixth Congress began to day. There was the usual handshaking la both houses; also the usual opening-day display of Mowers on the desks of members. The President's message was read, and it was the feature of the day's proceedings. Comments of Indianians on the message follow: 'Senator Fairbanks It 13 an excellent and admirable paper, dealing with domestic and foreign affairs in an able manner.

SENATE. Vermont's Nerr Member Sworn In Death of Gear and Davis Announced. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 In the Senate, to day, the work of the short session of the Fifty-sixth Congress was successfully launched. It had been the purpose of the Senate to announce the death of Senators Gear, of Iowa, and Davis, of Minnesota, Immediately after assembling, and then to adjourn and receive the message of the President to-morrow; but as this has been announced by the leaders of both branches of Congress to be a "business session," It was determined to receive the'message to day and thus gain one day in a session when that much time may be of immense Importance. Aside from the reading of the message and the administration of the oath of office to William B. Dillingham, the new senator from Vermont, who succeeds the late Jus tin S. Morrill, no business was transacted. The other new member of the body, former Representative John P. Dolllver, wha suc ceeds the late Senator Gear, of Iowa, was present throughout the session, but his credentials were not presented and he was not sworn In. The formalities will be com- pleted td-morrow. now that the Senate has been Informed officfally of the death of Senator Gear. ' A notable meeting on the floor Just before the session opened was that between Mr. llanra, of Ohio, and Mr. Jones, of Arkan sas, chairmen, respectively, of the Repub lican and Democratic national campaign committees. Surrounded by many of their colleagues they exchanged cordial greet ings and laughed and chatted for several minutes. The air of tho chamber was heavy with perfume from magnificent floral pieces. After the usual opening routine and the appointment of a committee to visit the House, Major Fruden, one of the secre taries to the President, was recognized and presented the awaited message of the President. It took Mr. Dennett, the secre tary of the Senate, one hour and fifty-four minutes to read It. Tho Senate then ad journed at 2:15 p. m. 

OPENING OP THE HOUSE. Oath. Administered to New Members Objection by air. Ralley. WASHINGTON. Dec. Z. The opening of the session In the House vras brilliant but r.ot exciting. There were the usual throngs in the galleries and the usual dis play of floral pieces on the floor, but the proceedings wero purely, formal, consist ing of the rapping to order by tho speaker, rrayer by tho chaplain, the roil call of members, the appointment of the formal committee to wait on the President and the reception and reading of the Presi dent's message. Despite tho fact that a great presidential campaign had concluded within a month the best feeling seemed to prevail between tho victors and the van quished. The reading of tho message, which naturally was the featur of the day, occupied over two hourb. It was listened to with respectful interest by both sides. The deaths of the late Representa tive Daly, of New Jersey, and IIofTecker. cf Delaware, and Senators Davis., of Min nesota, and Gear, of Iowa, were an noutced, and as a further mark of respect to tnelr memories the House adjourned until to-morrow. When Speaker Henderson called the House to order at noon the desks of half the members wero freighted with flowers from admirinic friends or constituents and the profusion of the floral pieces gave the vast hall mora the appearance of a garden than a legislative assembly. The floral places were of Infinite variety. Roses, car rations and chrysanthemums of every hue rrere made into every conceivable design. The sreat proportion of tho flowers wer en the Republican fc?de, and one could rr.-r'.: the geographltll limits ot the vlc-t-riti: pzny In the 'recent campaign by t:.- Cowered arei. litre and there, how ever, r.u cdmlrity constituent had depos ited a bunch of floweiV''- o n the Democratic side. They usually-., .ed the scat of one who had won a personal tri umph. In the galleries tho wealth and beauty of the capital was present gowned in smart winter frocks. When the roll had been called the speak er announced that 273 members had re sponded to their names, a quorum, and the House was ready for business. The follow ing members-elect then appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of al legiance: Albert D. Shaw, who succeeds the late Representative Checkering, of New York; Allen M. McDermott, who succeeds the late Representative Daly, of New Jer sey; Walter O. Hoffccker, who succeeds the late Representative Hoffecker, of Dela ware; Edward De V. Morrell, who suc ceeds the late Representative Harmer, of Pennsylvania; William Richards, who suc ceeds Gen. Joseph Wheeler, of Alabama; W. H. Jackson, who succeeds Governor Smith, of Maryland; Sarauel D. Woods, who succeeds Representative Devries, of California. Mr. Bailey, of Texas, questioned the form of the resignation of Representative Dol llver. He said he doubted tho right of a member to resign at a future fixed date. Ho said he would not raise the point for mally, but merely called attention to it so in future it could not be used as a precedent. Mr. Dolliver's resignation, he said, had been tendered, to take effect Dec. 1, so that Mr. Connor had been elected to fill a vacancy which did not exist at tho time of the election. He cited a court de cision to show that a resignation to take effect at a future date was not a resigna tion in fact, but 6lmply a notification of a resignation to be made in the future. Mr. Bailey said he did not desire to press the matter, but desired the protest to be filed. The speaker stated that. Inasmuch as ob jection had been made, Mr. Connor would step aside until the protest had been dis posed of. The speaker announced the appointment of Mr. Babcock, of Wisconsin, on the committee on ways and means, to succeed Mr. Dolllver. After the adoption of formal resolution the House, qt 1 o'clock, took a recess until 2 o'clock, when the President's message was laid before the House. Its reading was listened to attentively. The reading occu pied two hours and ten minutes. There were no demonstrations during the reading, but as the clerk finished there was a scat tering round of applause on the Republican side. The House adjourned at 4:20 p. m. 

ELIHU ROOT'S REPORT INTERESTING REVIEW OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY'S WORK. Secretary of Wnr Tells What Has Dcen Done In the Philippines, in China, Cnba and Porto Rico. MINIMUM FORCE OF 60,000 WITH AN AUTHORIZED MAX 1 31 UM OF 100,000 ?IEN RECOMAt ENDED. The Secretary Confident Hint nt No Distant Day the Philippine Will Pay for Their Ovrn Protection. WASHINGTON. Dec. 2. The annual re port of Secretary Root is of more than usual interest owing to its wide scope and the fact that it treats of subjects of such importance as the Philippine insurrection, the Chinese campaign, the developments in Cuba and Porto Rico and finally with tho subject of army reorganization. Some Idea of what the array has been doing in the field and at home is conveyed by the secretary'3 statements that its operations included tho prosecution of the war for tho suppression of the Philippine insurrec tion and the establishment of a govern ment in the Philippines, the rescue of the foreign ministers In Feklng, the preserva tion and the relief of distress !n Alaska and the construction of roads and tele graphs there, the conduct of tho govern ment of Forto Rico until May 1 last, the conduct of the government of Cuba, prose cution of river and harbor works, the con struction of seacoast fortifications, the gar risoning and maintaining of military posts and fortifications, the discharge of about one-third of tho army and the re-enlistment of soldiers to take their place, and the dis. trlbutlon of supplies to the scattered forces. The chapter of the report treating of military operations in tho Philippines is a recital of the features of the campaigns that were conducted in tho islands during the past year. It is said that the pur pose was to pursue the small bands of Fili pinos scattered throughout the islands. The effort was successful and resulted in the further and practically complete dis integration of the insurrectionary bands, in the rescue of nearly all the American and Spanish prisoners, in the capture of many of the leading Insurgents and the destruction of large quantities of arms and supplies. Secretary Root says that with the execution of the military plans there all formal and open resistance to Ameri can authority in the Philippines disap peared, leaving only an exceedingly vexa tious and annoying guerrilla warfare of a character closely approaching brigandage, which will require time, patience and good judgment to finally suppress. Tho secretary further states that it re quires over 400 different posts in the Philip pines because the Tagalogs who are in rebellion have deliberately adopted the policy of murdering, so far as able, all of their countrymen who are friendly to the United States. He thinks that tho most efficient measures of the reduction of the number of posts and of troops in the Philippines will be the construction of roads, making possible rapid communica tion, the establishment of personal relations between our officers and the peoplo so that wo can tell who are trustworthy sources of information, the gradually growing ap preciation of American control and good intentions following good civil government, and finally the organization of native troops under American officers. The sec retary also ttlls of 'the progress made In the creation of civil government in the islands. RECOMMENDATIONS. Secretary Root recommends that Con gress authorize a bond issue for the con struction of a railroad based on the road Itself, or that the United States make a loan to the insular treasury to be repaid from the island revenues. The secretary speaks of the' serious embarrassment caused by the defective currency system in the Philippines owing to the fluctuating CONTINUED ON PAGE 2, COL. A.)

TWO BRIDAL COUPLES HURT WERE RETURNING TO WISCONSIN FROJI WEDDINO TRIPS. Holler, Which Weighed Ten Tons, Llonn Sixty Feet from Its Red Property Loss, $l00,OO0. CHICAGO, Dec. 3. Five railway employes were instantly killed and twelve persons injured by the explosion of a boiler in the power house of the Chicago & Northwest ern road this evening. Several of the in jured are hurt so badly they may die.- A list of casualties follows: Killed August Clamman. section fore man, crushed by falling wall3 while stand ing near power house; Antony Krause, fire man at power house, internally Injured, died on way to hospital; August Weiss, sec tion hand, struck by boiler; Joseph Specht, section hand, caught under boiler; Henry Schnur, eighteen years old, clerk in audit ing office of Northwestern road, neck broken by flying debris while walking past power house. Injured John Butterworth, chief elec trician of the power-house, skull fractured, internal injuries, will probably die; August Beck, Milwaukee, injured by part of the roo? of parlor car falling on him; Mrs. August Reck, Milwaukee, thrown against seat, internally Injured, may die; William Becker, Sheboygan, Wis., severely bruised; Mrs. Ethel Becker, Sheboygan, Wis., slightly bruised; Michael McGregor, severely burned, may die; Joseph Kovelskl, severely burned; George GÃ¼lls, severely burned; John Brown, severely burned; Carl Peters, arm broken; August Holtz, side and arm bruised; Eugene Gingrich, blown through door of power house, slight ly bruised. The power house was a two-story struc ture which stood west of the passenger station and north of the tracks leading into it. On the first floor was the boiler room, containing a battery of four boilers and the dynamo room, which held nine dynamos. Twelve men were employed around the building and in addition to such of these as were present at the time, a number of strangers wero standing around watching the dynamos. It Is not known what caused the explos ion as everything in the boiler room seemed in excellent condition, according to the un injured men who worked in the place. At a few minutes past 5 o'clock one of the boilers in the center of the row of four burst with a detonation that was plain ly heard at points a mile distant. The end of the boiler nearest the tracks was the weak part of the structure and it flew to ward the depot tracks and landed fully seventy feet away from Its starting point. The boiler itself, which weighed ten tons, lies to-night sixty feet from the boiler house. Just as the explosion occurred the Ash land limited train was pulling out of the station. The greater part of the train had passed and . although the cars were all heavily battered with falling bricks and debris none of them was badly damaged and the passengers within them escapcJ unhurt. The last two cars, a Pullman sleeper and a drawing room car, were not so fortunate and the boiler head and the boiler Itself caught them. Tho boiler struck the car in the rear, while tho boiler head ploughed through the one immediately In front. Fortunately both flew high and struck tho cars above the windows, carry ing away portions of the roof and vestibule. But few of the passengers happened at the time to be in the ends of the two cars hit by the flying metal and such of them as were hurt were struck by flying splinters or suffered from being thrown violently to the floor. On the train were Mr. and Mrs. August Beck, of Milwaukee, and Mr. and Mrs. Wil liam Becker, of Sheboygan, Wis. Both couples were returning from their bridal tour and all four were injured. Mrs. Beck was dashed against a seat in the car and sustained Internal Injuries which may prove fatal. Neither of the cars was thrown from the track and the engine drew them quite a distance before coming to a stop. Traffic, however, was interrupted for sev eral hours. The destruction of the electric lighting plant plunged the depot into dark ness and the pile of debris which was thrown across tho tracks temporarily blocked the suburban traffic of the road. Every attention to tho wounded was shown by the officials of the Northwestern road. All wero conveyed as quickly as possible to hospitals, where their wounds were dressed. The property loss to the road will not be far from $100,000. Tho boiler house was practically reduced to a ruin, two sides be ins blown completely out and the' costly electric plant was nearly torn to pieces. The regular traffic of the road was delayed about four hours, it requiring that length of time to clear the tracks. Tho cause of the explosion is a mystery, the boilers hav ing been inspected by the Insurance com pany Sept. 1 and Nov. 1, and being reported iu perfect order. Mrs. Deck n Hrewer's Daughter.

Mrs. Beck was re cently married and with her husband was Just completing their wedding trip. SCALDED IN BATH TUB. Editor Qulnn, of Successful Ameri cans. So Badly Injured He Died. NEW YORK, Dee. 3.-Edward B. Qulnn, thirty-three years old, editor of the maga zine Successful Americans, was removed from the Delavan Hotel ut noon to-day so badly scalded that he died this evening. Mr. Qulnn registered at the hotel on Friday last. He went to his room and turned on the water in the bath tub prep aratory to taking a bath. He had shut off the hot water and allowed the cold only to run. During his absence from the room the cold water was turned off and the hot water allowed to run. On his return Mr. tjuinn, without investi gating the temperature cf the water, jumped in the bath tub. He was scalded all over his body. He was attended by the hotel physician until to-day, when it was decided to remove him to the hospital, where ho succumbed to his injuries tonight. TRAGEDY IN MAD BROOK. Elght-Vear-Old Irl Carried Away uy n Panther and Devoured. CART WRIGHT, Wis., Dec. 3. An eight-year-old daughter of C. F. Riley, a farmer living about sixteen miles from here, hi the Mad Brook settlement, was carried away by a huge panther and devoured. Only a few fragments of the remains could be found. The community has organized in a panther hunt and the farmers will not lay aside their guns until the brutes are exterminated. Since they started out a panther measuring ten feet from tip to tip has been shot and two other large ones have been seen. HIS EYES BURNED OUT TEXAN LITERALLY ROASTED WHILE SITTING IN A CHAIR. Alleged to Have Been Drugged, Tur pentine Ponred Over Him and a Match Applied. DALLAS. Tex., Dec. 3. Screams of agony brought policemen to a saloon In East Dallas this morning at 1:30 o'clock. Stated in a chair, unable to move, was a man who.e garments were a mass of flames. The officers say Eugene Faulkner and J. W. Chapman were standing behind the bar, smoking cigars and watching the unfortunate man, who was being roasted to death. "Bring some water here quick," shouted an officer. "Get it yourself," the policemen declare one of tho men retorted. "Let him die. W hat's the use of worry ing over him." One of the officers took off his coat and with it beat out the fire. The man was sent to the City Hospital, where he, died at 6 a. m. Soon after his arrival at tho hospital the two men who were in the barroom were brought before him for identification. Then It was that the discovery was made that hi3 eyes had been burned out. He was "Pate" Bain, for many years a con stable at Garland, in this county. It is claimed by tho officers that Bain was drugged and as he reclined in a chair un conscious a quantity of turpentine was poured over him and a match applied. The man was literally roasted. When the heat and pain lid partly revived him ho called piteoÃ¼sly for help and when none came he screamed and attracted the officers. When news of the outrage became wide spread the greatest indignation was ex pressed. The two suspects were put in the city jail and guarded by deputies. Shortly after 10 o'clock to-night a mob of fifteen or twenty men called at the Jail and demanded the prisoners of the Jailer. The jailer swore that they were not In his possession. They had been taken to Fort Worth early in the evening, he declared. "Well," said the leader of tho mob, "If we catch them we'll burn them." Faulkner and Chapman refused to talk, and no motive is known for the crime. COMMENT ON MESSAGE HOW LONDON EDITORS VIEW THE PRESIDENT'S UTTERANCES. For Once the "Thunderer' Sees Some Good in the American Adminis tration's Chinese Policy. LONDON, Dec. 4. Comment upon Presi dent McKinley's message to Congress is chiefly devoted to the reference to Ameri ca's Chinese policy. The Daily Graphic says: "The policy of the United States regarding China is not heroic, but it is certainly practical, and there is ample reason to believe that it will prevail." The Times says: "The message makes it clear that on the vital point of insisting on punishment for the outrages Mr. Mc Kinley remains firm. We are glad to see that on . the subject of guarantees for Christian converts the President makes a new proposal in advance of any put for ward elsewhere. In regard to the indem nity question he is In agreement with some of the best opinions in England." The Times, editorially, concludes with the expression of a hope that Mr. McKinley's pecond term may be marked by a "satis factory settlement of all outstanding questions between Creat Britain and America." The Dally News says: "The message contains nothing new and nothing very illuminating on matters that are old. It will be very closely scanned for Its refer ences to China. It looks as though the American formula were that the powers ure to specify the culprits and the Chi nese government is to specify the punish ment. On such terms a speedy settlement would undoubtedly be possible, but would it be effective or durable?" The Standard, which agrees with the 1 Times In thinking that if all the powers had withdrawn after the legations were relieved to the same extent as the United States, there would not now be much chance tf obtaining satisfaction, re marks: "The excessive anxiety to re establish trade with China, Is perhaps the real explanation of some points that have not seemed satisfactory in the recent policy of the United States." In the opin ion of the Standard the Washington gov ernment has "acted as a drag on Euro pean diplomacy." The Dally Chronicle observes: "Clearly the United States government is able to boast of an aggregate of Imports and ex ports exceeding two billions .and to pro po?e a reduction of revenue taxation to the extent of thirty millions. The admin istration has a fair Justification, even if there be no very obvious need, for further encouraging the American mercantile marine" 

KRÃGER SORRY KAISER WILHELM'S REBUFF RE GRETTED II V THE ROER LEADER. Will Make Another Request for n Hearing, and Is Confident He Will Not Be Slighted Again. TEARS IN "00M" PAUL'S EYES AS HE REPLIED TO A DEPUTATION OF GERMAN SY3IPATIIIZERS. Action of the Emperor Dne to an Agreement with Britain, Accord ing to the Parisian Press. INDIGNATION IN GERMANY ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT GENERALLY' CONDEMNED. Resolution of Sympathy Introduced In the Lower Branch of Congress by Mr. Fitzgerald. PARIS, Dec. 3. A special from Cologne says: Mr. Kruger, after he had received Emperor William's telegram, spoke as fol lows to a deputation of "Friends of the Boers." "I hope with all my heart that the cir cumstances which prevents his Majesty from receiving me to-day will become more favorable later. I shall never cease to have confidence In the spirit of Justice of the Emperor, who, without knowing me, sent me four years ago significant en couragement. I shall stay some time at The Hague, and will then renew my re quest, and this time tho Emperor will not refuse." Mr. Kruger was sad, and afterwards retired to his apartment In tears. Emperor William's telegram to Mr. Kruger refusing to receive him, continues to be the chief subject of comment in the French press. The afternoon newspapers strike a note of sadness. They see in his Majesty's action the shattering of his reputation for chivalry. The Temps and Journal des Debats explain Emperor Wil liam's message by the Anglo-German un derstanding of African questions. The Temps says: "The Emperor's word ing, that he could not recrlve Mr. Kruger on account of hl3 position already taken, Is very clear. Every one understands that the Emperor, if not actually fulfilling one of the clauses of the recent Anglo-German accord, Is Inspired by the spirit thereof in declining to receive Mr. Kruger. Neither the declarations of Count Von Buelow nor of others have concealed.. from the eyes of the world that the Emperor has veered his policy In favor of England Blnce he sent his famous dispatch on the Jamieson raid. Mr. Kruger's advisers neither saw nor foresaw anything and they exposed Mr. Kruger to the total check he has Just ex perienced. This, perhaps, is not the first bad advice they gave him, which explains many things in the past." Yves Guyot, in the Clecle, compares the attitude of Emperor William with that of France, to the advantage of the former. He says: "Emperor William wishes to show his government had not surrendered its powers to the least enlightened classes and intimated to Mr. Kruger that he was opposed to his coming to Berlin to be acclaimed by bands, led by Dr. Leyds, or paid agitators. I can affirm to a certitude that If Mr. Kruger approaches the Czar diplomatically he will meet with an equally categorical refusal." "It is probable," says a special dispatch from Cologne, "that Mr. Kruger will meet Emperor Nicholas at Nice or Mentone, where the Czar's physicians have advised hira to go for his convalescence." CONDE3INED BY GERMANS. Action of the Government Not In Ac cord with Popular Sentiment. BERLIN, Dec. 3. The government's curt and decisive intimation that Emperor Wil liam would not be able to receive Mr. Kru ger has created a profound Impression throughout Germany. What may be called the anti-British section of the press does not conceal its annoyance and the moder ate anglophobe organizations with diffi culty repress utterances of disappointment. The inspired Journals declare that it was Germany's desire to Intimate definitely that Mr. Kruger's visit would not be welcome; and therefore the fact that he omitted to comply with the strict etiquette of the Ger man court and deferred asking Emperor William for an audience until he had reached the Belgo-Gcrman frontier was eagerly seized as a reasonr for denying hhn such an audience. The semi-official Cologne Gazette pub lishes the matter as follows: "The question as to whether Emperor William would wel come Mr. Kruger's visit must be answered without qualification in the negative. The reason why such a visit just now cannot be welcomed is plain, for Mr. Kruger in tends the requested audience, not only as a mere act of politeness but as an occasion for receiving proofs of personal sympathy. Furthermore, he is prosecuting at the same time outspoken political alms and desires to induce the rulers of those states which he visits to abandon the strict neutrality they have hitherto found reason to main tain In the war between Great Britain and the Transvaal. The maintenance of a strict neutrality, however, accords with Germany's interests, and it would be a serious political error If a mere suspicion was created that, at Mr. Kruger's wi.?h, this neutrality would no longer be main tained." Mr. Kruger's reception at Cologne was exceedingly enthusiastic as far as the citizens were concerned. They had planned a torchlight procession and serenades, but the police forbade both. Mr. Kruger's dispatches to Count Von Buelow, the Imperial chancellor, and to the heads of the German states were left unanswered. There Is no doubt that as late as Saturday Foreign Office officials contemplated that Mr. Kruger would be received in Berlin to-morrow. Emperor William and Count Von Buelow must have, reconsidered the original plan. It is sug gested that, as Mr. Kruger's intention to come to Berlin was mooted while in France the Kaiser and his advisers may have sus pected a trap. Herr Vcn Tschlrshky, German minister to Luxcmbeurg, under Emperor William's instructions, personally thanked Mr. Kruger for the telegram to the Kaiser, and Mr. Kruger, when thanking the en voy, said: "I invoke God's blessing upon that august personage." Diplomatists generally regard Mr. Kru ger's mission as frustrated and consider Germany's action 'of great political Impor tance, as denoting a new era In the rela tions between Germany and Great Britain. On the other hand the government's atti tude is certainly condemned by a large por tion of the nation, and there can be no question that a vast majority of the repre sentative Journals throughout the empire remain pro-Krugcr. Yesterday even the court preacher. Dr. Kritlnger, in the new cathedral, delivered a discourse filled with sentiments strongly favoring the Boer cause. Also Rebuffed by Francis Joseph. LONDON, Dec. 4. "In response to a con fidential inquiry as to whether Mr. Kruger would be welcomed here," says the Vienna correspondent of the Dally Mall, "a polite reply was returned to the effect that Em peror Francis Joseph had made other dis positions for the next few weeks." The Vienna- correspondent of the Daily Chronicle wires that Mr. Kruger will not visit either Vienna or Rom?. IN BEHALF OF BOERS. Resolution of Sympathy nnd Praise Offered by Mr. Fitzgerald. WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. A resolution in behalf of ex-President Kruger was to-day Introduced in the House by Representative Fitzgerald, of Massachusetts. It recites: "Whereas, The heroic struggle made by the Boer republics to maintain their ex istence has excited the sympathy of the whole world, therefore, be it "Resolved, That the efforts of Paul Kruger to obtain the assistance of the civil ized nations of the world in securing peace nnd proper terms of settlement between Great Britain and the Boer republics is de serving of the praise and sympathy of the American people." DEED OF A GOVERNOR YC IISIEVS FRIGHTFUL BUTCHERY IN SHAN-SI PROVINCE. Details of the Slaughter of Minsion nries, Chinese Converts and Two Hundred Orphans. KWAN CHANG INTERVIEWED CHINESE IRRITATED, HE SAYS, BY WALD ERSE E'S EXPEDITIONS. Emperor Will Not Rctnrn to Peking as Long as Foreign Troops lie main at the Capital. BERLIN, Dec. 3. A special dispatch from China to the Volks Zeitung reports a fear ful mission slaughter In the province of Shan-Si. The first victims, the dispatch says, were a Catholic bishop and his co adjutors and four European priests, Fran ciscans, Italians and French. The Gov ernor invited them to his house, pretending to give them better protection, but when they arrived their hands were tied. Then the Governor poniarded them all. Next the Governor went to the bishop's residence with a number of soldiers and seized six Marseilles sisters. He promised them money and distinguished husbands if they would renounce Christianity, which offer they unanimously rejected. Thereupon the Governor poniarded them and also a num ber of Chinese priests, thirty Chinese Els ters and two hundred orphans from three to sixteen years of age. Mr. and Mrs. At water and their two little children, Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Price and their son, all of the American board, Mr. and Mrs. Lagren, of the Swedish, and Miss Eldred, an English woman, were butchered. The story of these murders directly Impli cated Yu Htien, then Governor of Shan-Si. As announced in the Peking dispatches of the Associated Press of Saturday last mem bers of Li Hung Chang's staff say the Chi nese Emperor will probably send Yu llfien a silk card, which is an intimation that he must hang himself. A number of reports have been published of the June massacre in Shan-Si, some of the details being too horrible for pub lication. Men, women and children were butchered. Fifteen seminarists who had hidden themselves in a cistern were, the dispatch says, tied to stalls and forced to drink the blood of the first victims. They were then killed. A Chinese priest and two Christians who attempted to escape wero caught and put in a small hut, where they were burned. A dispatch from Field Marshal Count Von Waldcrsee, commander-in-chief of the in ternational forces in China, sent from Pe king under' date of Dec. 1, says that after hoisting the German flag at the Ming tombs and punishing several native villages for the murder of Christians, the late Colonel Yorck's detachment, commanded by Gen eral Gay!, returned to Peking in four col umns by way of Yang-Fang, Chen-Plen-Tcheng, Thang-Shang and Niu-Lan-Shan. each about a day's march northward of Peking. The Kalgan expedition, the dispatch also says, was very successful. Several thou sand Chinese regulars under the command of two generals, were driven in wild flight from the province of Chl-Li to Shan-SI. The remains of the late Colonel Yorck have arrived at Feklng. m CONGER'S INSTRUCTIONS. He Will Withhold His Signature Until the Agreement Is Modified. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The text of the agreement arrived at by the foreign min isters at Peking has not yet reached the State Department from Minister Conger, and he is still withholding his signature to the document. Meanwhile it Is said that, following his latest Instructions to eonfer with the British and German ministers at reklng, he is making substantial head way toward the substitution of a modified agreement on the lines of the policies laid down in the State Department's various propositions to the powers. While the United States government has not seen fit to mako any formal protest against the continuance of the punitive expeditions be ing gent out from Peking from time to time it has managed to convey to the pow ers its belief that the further prosecu tion of this policy Is indiscreet and will tend to greatly delay tho return of the Chinese authorities to Peking and the final settlement toward which all efforts are now directed. It Is believed these intima tions have been taken in good part by the various foreign offices and that a restrain tCONT IN L ED ON PÃG EITcOLT SENATE PLANS ORDER OF BUSINESS DECIDED ON BY R E 11 ULI CA X CO M M ITT E C Ship Subsidy Bill, Hay-Fauucef ote Treaty and the Army Mensurc to Be Glveu Right of Way.

In ac cordance with this understanding Senator Frye, at the first opportunity to-morrow, will move to take up the bill and if this motion prevails, as there is little doubt It will, the effect will be to displace the Spooner bill, Which there is no disposition a this time to press. Senator Frye proba bly will make a speech. It Is not expected that any one other senator will be pre pared to proceed on the subsidy measure, and In that event Senator Lodge, of the committee on foreign relations, who will have charge of the treaty, will move an executive session in order to consider the treaty. The arrangement further provides that if the army bill reaches the Senate prior to tho disposal of the shipping bill or the treaty, either or both of these may be dis placed temporarily in order to permit the prompt consideration of that measure, which Is considered to bo of more pressing importance than cither of the other ques tions. The same understanding prevails regarding the appropriation bills. Senator Morgan's Nicaraguan canal bill received somo consideration at the hands of the committee on order of business. While no definite agreement was reached concerning it, the opinion was generally expressed that it should wait on the Senate's action on the treaty. " The members of the committee apparently consider that ratification of the treaty is a necessity preliminary to the passage of the canal bill, and the present disposition is to contend for that order of precedence. The committee also discussed the possi bility of Democratic opposition to the sub sidy bill. Some of the members who had talked with Democratic senators, expressed the opinion that there would be no effort to prevent this legislation by factious op position, though they expect a number of speeches against it.

Representative Hay, of Vir ginia, a member of the military committee, explained the status of the army bill pro posed by Secretary Root and urged the desirability of not legislating until tho course of the government as to th Philip pines had been more definitely determined. He proposed the following resolution: "Resolved, That it is the sense of this caucus that the law now In existence as to the army be continued for two years from July 1. 1D00." This led to extended discussion. Mr. Slayden, of Texas, also of the military committee, amended tho tlmo one year. Mr. Jones, of Virginia, offered a substitute resolution, expressing the opposition of the caucus to the army reorganization bill submitted by the War Department. Rep resentatives Richardson, Bailey, Carmack. Newlands, Cox and others made speeches, showing considerable diversity of opinion as to what should bo done.
