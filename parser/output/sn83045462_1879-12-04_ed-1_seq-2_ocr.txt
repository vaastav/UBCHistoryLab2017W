Tim STAz has a direct wire from its news room to the Western Union Telegraph offiee in New York ety. from which wires radiate to all parts of the globe. and in therefore enabled to secu* the latest news by Its own operator from every quarter up to within a few momeuts of going to press. It Is the only evening paper south of Philadelphia which re e3tves exclusively the Amociated Prom dispatches. The Holiday Semsen-Deuble Sheet. The double sheet, or eight-page STAR of flty* ilz columns, will be Issued as usual on Saturday, to meet the demands upon the advertising space. The number of new advertisements last Satur day reached 161-which was unprecedented in the historyof the paper. Advertisers will there Are confer a favor by sending in their orders as early as possible for the enlarged and extra edition. The Finucial Cietest. The difficulty in reconciling the views set orth by the President of the United States in his annual message and the Secretary of the Treasury In his annual report, with the views undoubtely held by a majority of the repre sentatives of the people and of the people them selves, grow out of the fact that there is so much truth and justice on each side of the question. On the one side, the legal-tender currency is regarded as temporary In Its character and an unfulfilled promise to pay; on the other side there Is a manifest determination that no re duction in the circulating medium shall be allowed to Interfere with the wave of prosperity which has now set in over the whole country, developing with wonderful rapidity Its resources and Industries. The government has recently devised an ex periment. growing out of the silver quesion, which may afford a partial or entire solution of the difficulty in the issue of silver certificates based upon the deposit of the coin. Why not do the same with the gold? ^ The gold now held Dy the Treasury for re SUmption is not part of the circulating medium, and can.only become so by the redemption of so many greenbacks; but the people do not want the gold. hence the greenbacks remain outstand Ing. It Is well the gold should remain in the Treasury; it Is more convenient to circulate notes and more economical as saving the abrasion to which the coin Is subject But the two hun dred millions of gold or whatever the amount held by the Treasury is, might be represented by that amount of gold certificates payable on demand, and be substituted for that amount of legal tender notes. The remaining 146 million of legal tenders could not possibly be reached until by allowing'the surplus revenue of the government to accumulate in gold a further issue of gold certificates would eventually pro vide for them. There could be no better currency than that afforded by one based as this would be on the deposit of coin, and It would be practically lim ited only by the ability of the Government to acquire coin or the desire of the people to place Its coin in the custody of the Government. In the event of an adverse balance of trade, to which we must look forward as among the probabilities of the future, the presentation of the coin certificates to obtain coin for export would soon raise the rates of interest to a point at which the export would be unprofitable, or, at any rate, have as much effect in that direc tion as does now the action of the Banks of England and France. The Political ande Faucial Sita tion in Virginia. The republican members of the Virginia legis lature, with but two or three exceptions, united with the readjusters In the organization of both 3ouses. This combination was the result of a bargain, which was carried out by dividing the legislative officers between republicans and re. adjusters. The old democratic employes were turned out to a man, including several disabled ex-confederate soldiers. By this compact all chance of the election of a republican to the U. S. Senate has been destroyed. Gen. Mahone is the choice of the readjusters, and will, it is said, be elected on the first ballot, as his party, aided by their republican allies, has a majority of 23 on joint ballot. Gen. Mahone is a democrat, on all national questions, and his vote and influence in the Senate will always be cast with that party. The republicans of the Virginia legisla ture have sadly disappointed their party in Its national organization and purposes. It was within their power, many of the wisest leaders believed, to have secured a u.S. Senator, and thus asm republican control of the Senate from March, 1881; but the legislators preferred a few o11es for their immediate friends, whereat the republican party, outside of Virginia, Is very Much disgusted. Gov. Holliday's message to the legislature was devoted chiefly to the settlement of the debt, and he served notice upon the read justers that the McCulloch bill can never be repealed or altered except over his veto. He Showed that the progress made towards a settle ment under the McCulloch plan has been most satisfactory, and he urged the final adoption of this plan. The debt-payers are, still, not with Out hope that the governor's advice may eventu ally be adopted by the legislature. Their theory is that the combination of readjusters and re publicans is only held together by the promise Of spoils, and such alliances never prove endur lag. The readjusters, It is said, propose to par cel out the state offices between themselves and the republicans in the proportion of their votes, respectively, but the latter are not content with this. They insist that as the readjusters could not accomplish anything without theIr aid, they (the republicans) should have half the offices, though numerically much smaller than their The nilitof Russa ae just failed In their fourth attempt to asasinate the Czar. This time they undertook to blow him up with an infernal machine while he was ena route to Mos tow, Intent upon his plan for the establishment of an advisory council or parliament. At this distance from the scene, and to the American mind, it would seem that this last attempt of the nihilists upon the Czar's life must have the effect of weakening his enemies, even If it does not create sympathy for him. While he was endeavoring to comply with what appeared to be a demand of the masses of the people for Some sort of participation in the affairs of gov ernment, it would have been decent, If not poll tic, to have afforded him every facility for put flng his plan into operation. The nihiust amuame to represent the people as against the heredItary aristocracy; the Czar expressed his willingness to make concessions to the people, and while in the act of doing what he supposes his subjects desIre, he is only saved from being BIown into the next world by the interposition et Providence. The pistol has been tried upon the Czar three times without harm to him. The firK time was when a peasant named Ossip Enmmnnaoff rushed in between the Czar and his would-be assassin Karakasoff, and struck down the latter's hand in time to prevent the Bellet from being sent into the august body of his majesty. The peasant was promoted to the dignity of a noble for his timely interfer sDes. The second attempt at assaminanunn was 3Uade In the Bois de Boulbgne, by the Pole unmonft who fired a double-barreled pistol and anonls in his purpose. Last April while walking 2nths grounds of the Winter palace, the Czar wasagain shot at, and though not wounded, was ~; Y7badly frightened.
