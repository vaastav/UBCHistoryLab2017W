UE!S OF REPRSENTATIVE JOURIALS )rift of the Views From the At lantic to the Pacific UBLISHED THIS MORNING. Torn the New York Prem. Shorn of the usual cant about economy. F the author's scruples about "a generous ad confiding people," his barren solicitudes or "many of our people engaged in a hard Truggle for the necessities of life," and Is egotistical assurances of "my willing ipport" for the advancement of "our be ved country," the document before us is s unusually interesting as it is ingeniously nsatisfactory. The country is plainly and luntly informed that British free trade is rectly before us, and that nothing so im rtant claims our attention. The New York Times commends Mr. leveland's Utterance on Hawaii as an honorable purpose," declares the pension tform, as outlined, "obviously true and und," and concludes: No message that Lr. Cleveland has sent to the national leg lature has been more characteristic or tore sure to confirm the people's confi rce in his soundness of judgment than its. We profoundly hope that before an ther message is required the country will e well advanced on the lines of right rinciple and sound policy which are here Ad down. rom the New York Herald. The dominant note of the President's Lessage, sent to Congress yesterday, is rompt tariff revision. All the other mat .rs subordinated to this. It is plain to :e that Mr. Cleveland considers the sue iss of this measure essential not only to te welfare of the ccuntry, but also the Oivation of the democratic party, and that athing can jeopardize its success more tan the failure of democrats to rise above cal considerations and unite in its sup )rt. rom the New York Son. "Cleveland devotes more space to what e regards as an excessive purchase of eeds by the Department of Agriculture tan to the momentous enterprise of throne uilding which he has undertaken in Ha raii. He devotes almost as many words to he condition of the North American In ian tribes as to the tariff, which occupied I1 of his thoughts in ls, and which has ecome. in I't!3, an affair not merely of comises, but of performance. For these asons, the message submitted yesterday my fairly be criticised as unsatisfactory its range, If not actually evasive in its rtetition." ron the New York Tribune. "The first snow storm and the message ppropriately came together to warn people hat a hard winter was coming. In its reatment of nearly all domestic ques ons the message is creditable in charac r, not more verbose than is usual for Mr. 'leveland, and in the main reasonable in s suggestions. But the country will idge this message, and the President him elf, mainly by the position he has taken egarding the question which most vitally *fects the industries and the earnings of .merican workingmen." rom the New York Iteconler. "The first annual message of President 'leveland's second administration is the eakest and most diriappointing state paper tat has come from his pen. The message I an insult to American common sense. t is a menace to American labor and apital." nru the 'hlladelphia North American. After reading Mr. Cleveland's remarks pon finance and tariff reform, candor com els us to say that the President h- missed te opportunity and lamentably failed in te discharge of his duty. rein the I'hiladelphia i'r-ss. President Clevelan's message will com letely disappoint the country. Not in what says, but in what it does not say, for a tore tame, empty, inane message could ot well be framed. Congress has rarely let with graver or more momentous ques ons demanding high statesmanship, com rehensive grasp and sure decision. The untry expected a vi-ile and illuminating Iscussion of these transcendant subjects, rhich, whether approved or not, would at ast command respect by its vigor and trength. Instead of such a positive and bust treatment, we have nothing but a eeble, rapid summary of department re orts, such as any chief clerk might have jade. r'm the Philadelphia Times. Tne Presilent is ve-y apt to do something kse than what is generally expected. Six ears ago he startled the country by an brupt departure from established custom i confining his annual message to a single ominant topic, leaving the routine state tent of public business to the reports of le several departments. This year. when has teen areumned that his message woul.1 Lnttain some inuenal politi l dellverane, e reverts to the old custom. His miesse a tl'al'.e i statement of the operations f the gove'rnment andl the contdition of pub er husiners as he lindls it. r. m th" l'hiladelphin RIt .. The message of the P'r-s~ent to Congress #Idisappointlnt It is a budget of interest ig recapitulaions of snatters mainly *ithin the public knowledge; I t it is ex sedingly barreni of ori'ginal :eeommenda ,ns. The Preswident sa'tsles himself with tatemenits of fact. leaving the inItiative of 'rislation to Congress. For the reasons in upport or such recomrmendlations he does rake the reader of the message will have > consult the department reports roml the Pil d -lo nla Injuirer. "The message, a~s a whale, is one of the eakest papers .hat ever insuoei from tihe i'hite House. It is totally devoid of cou ge or of a p~olicy beyond the theory of iriff reform, and even on this topic, where j much was anticipatei, the President ilks as if he feared to speak his convic ons. All through the docunient the im resslon is given that the P-esident is try ig to hide behind the skirts of some one 1st-to throw all the responsibility upon 'ongress." Tomn the Philadelphin Inilger. President Cleveland's first annual message 1 the fifty-third Congress is especially not ble foe its comprehensiveness, and, int espect to those more important questions rhich in greater degree affect the whole eing of the nation, for the earnestness, incerity and ability with which they are resented and discussed. rom the San Francisco Biullet in. It was reasonably expected that Mr. leveland would have something interesting 1 say on the subject of Chirnese registra ion and deportation. On the contrary e dismisses it in a few brief paragraphs. |ve'i more unsatisfactory is his treatment f the Hawaiian matter. Whl-at he has to ay is an absolute withholding of infor ration. The offense in this message is die ignoring of the right of Congress to ave any voice in the settlement of our reign relations, including practically is uing of a declaration of war upon and ubverting a recognized government. The San Francisco Post is disappointed ecause the President has failed to enunci te a clear financial policy by offering a ubstitute for the law that was abrogated Iso because the Hawaiian matter has had o new light caist upon it. The San Francisco Daily Report charges ire President with Ignoring the fact that tie Hawaiian queen was removed by her wn people for violating the constitution he has sworn to obey. Other points in tie message which will also give rise to ery opposite expressio'is of opinion, the ;eport says, are his suggetions that the trength of the United States army be de rea-ed, that the time has come when ap ropriations for the butlding of new ships 'r the navy mav. be cut down; that the 'nited States shrould not mieile In aiairs f Samoa, and that the ('tinese are sincere their expre'sel intention to obey the egistration laws. rern theo Cicag Tribuone. "An unusual amount of space is devoted y the President in his message to a state rent o'f the Information contained in the nepartment reports, and particularly to the lations of the gove~rnmrent with foreign owers. T'hough some of these relations ave been of a perplexing nature, the Pres lent Is of the opinion that they are not so mbarrassing that they cann,,t be settled pon the hasis of right and justice. There I one subject of diplomatic n.-g'tiatio~n for iformationi upon which the public will look nxtously, hut, alas, in vain. Becyond ad titting that our relations with Hawaii are rnbarrassed seriously, the P'resident sheds o light upon the situiatior. He does not ave as much to say on the subject of the rirff in his message as it was supposed he 'ould, and what he does say could have pen condensed into a brief recommenda on: 'Please pass the Wilson bill without mendments' " r,'m tihe Ioulsv~le Courier-Journal. "rhe crtecnim to which President rle land's message is open Is that it is too long, dealing too elaborately with the details of the department reports. Aside from this, It is a state paper with all the merits of earn estness, directness and clearness which dis tinguish the public utterances of Mr. Cleveland. "Upon the three questions which are now of foremost interest-the questions of tariff reform, finance and our foreign relations the President is explicit as to his attitude. Frvn tha lIffal' (ourier. President Cleveland's views on the re formation of the customs taxation are so well known that it was unnecessary for him to elaborate them in his annual mes sage, especially in view of the preparation and publication of the Wilson bill. The message belongs to a high rank of state parers. It is statesmanlike, conservative, patriotic. It will strengthen the confidence of thinking men in the prudence and wis dom of the administration in dealing with our domestic affairs and our foreign re lations. From the Buffalo Express. In general, the President's message is merely formal and very uninteresting. It will disappoint greatly those who, remem bering the famous message of 1887. expect ed something of similarly vigorous and sensational tone. e President has an nounced no new policy. He has not even told his plans about the old policies. The greater part of his message is made up of statistics and extracts from the depart mental reports, which had already been published. From the Chicago Herald. "The message sent yesterday by Presi dent Cleveland to Congress is a simple and straightforward document. It is singularly free from rhetorical passages or platitudes. Each paragraph is a compact treatment of a theme or an Aspect of one. The message is, in fact, a courteous business letter, con veying a large mass of well arranged In formation on practical concerns in whose discussion and dispossal the legislature must co-operate with the executive." From the lBoston Herald. President Cleveland's message Is of rea sonable length, and it is concisely worded. It is clear and frank in statement, and when we say this we say what is equiva lent to declaring it to be charatteristic of its author. The message is well written, which is likely to insure its general reading. It will incregse the already strong confi dence of the country in the man who is its author. From the Hestos Globe. There is no mistaking the President's staujichness to his conviction. He stands firmly, as always, for the right as he sees it. There is no aid or comfort in the mes sage for faint-heartedness or timidity in tariff legislation. Party considerations and the welfare of the multijudinous business interests of the country alike demand that the line of action indicated by Mr. Cleve land shall be carried out firmly and faith fully. The Boston Journal devotes its editorial comments to the tariff portions of the mes sage, and says after quoting the President's words as to the tariff reform pledges of the democratic party: "Here we have the fa miliar wobbling and balancing from which almost any meaning might be inferred were it not that in this instance the Wilson bill furnishes a concrete and definite exprespion of the President's policy." From the ialtim ure Sun. The true principles of tariff revision are succinctly stated and the President's hearty indorsement given to the bill which has been prepared by the 'ways and means committee. Its treatment of foreign af fairs is especially to be commended and again recalls by way of contrast the ig norant jingoism and blustering tone of some of the messages that have been sent to "ongre"s since Air. Cleveland last occu pied the White House. Friom the itultimore American. President Cleveland's message will be dis appointing as well to his friends and ad mirers as to his political opponents. Its construction Is faulty, its tone carping and querulous and its diction will n;.t give it rank with the majority of state papers which have come from the White House, nor with those heretofore written by Mr. Cleveland himself. His style, though some what stilted, has generally been clear and pointad. Front the Baltimore Hernld. "Taken as a whole the document is an able state paper, and while it covers a very w'.le field it is replete with suggestions which. If carried out, would place our national affairs on a firm and enduring basis." 

LONDON PAPERS' VIEWS. they Express Their Pleasure at the President's Views. The London Times says of the President's message: "The message exhibits clear and well-seasoned views of policy as well as much force of character. The portions bear ing upon foreign affairs are conceived in a highly creditable spirit and adequate sense of the national dignity, combined with a sincere desire of peace and a careful regard for the rights and susceptibilities of other countries. The friendly expressions em ployed in mentioning the tquestions pending between the United States and the United Kingdom repeat the dominant feeling as well as the paramount interests in both. The Times commends with special warmth the President's policy toward Hawaii. The Standard say;: "Mr. Cleveland has stood for reform lIke a rock. No wards cod.d be clearer in dealing with the thorny to-<f question and no attitude could be sounder from the American standpoint. The President and his cabinet have c'econ their position with remarkable shrewdness. Tneir policy divides and demoralizes the e'nemy at the tbeginning of the battle. It h also a lalley which commends Itself to the nmost ardent Am:erica-for-the-Agericans patriot.'" The M.orning Post says: "There is no in 'ileation in it of party exultation.

EfTTERSTHAT ARE OF LOCAL IIITER Lights and Buoys in the Chess apeake Bay. INTERESTING FACTS The report of the light house board to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, was tc day made public. A detailed statement c the work done in each of the sixteen ligi house districts shows that the board ha brought the numerous and varied aids t ravigation under its charge up to th proper standard, and has done all that wa possible with the funds' provided to met the requirements of commerce and naviga tion. The board renews its recommendatio that steps be taken to prohibit the estat lishment and maintenance of private light and buoys in navigable waters of th United States, except in such cases as th consent of the board is given. The board again recommends the apprc priation of 315,000 for the erection of of houses, hopes for an increase In light sta tions this year, an'1 asks that the apprc priation for that purpose be increased t 3410,000. In speaking of the salaries of light hous keepers the report says that the presen force is too small; the men are overworke and cannot put the complicated fog signal ing and lighting mechanism at work ih proper time. A higher grade of skill is re quired to care for and operate the delicat mechanism, and that involdss higher sals ries. But even to employ a sufficient sum ber of men of the present grade of abilit; will require an appropriation of $)r0,0U0, as increase of $10,000, to be divided among 1,200 keepers. An appropriation of 3300,000 is requests for the maintenance of light vessels, anc (34),000 is asked for expenses of buoyage Thtee hundred and fifty thousand dollars it is estimated, will be required to proper); light the rivers of the country this year The board urgently recommends the paa sage of the bill now before Congress ap propriating $150,00 to provide and main tain communication by telegraph or tele phone between light ships, light houses an life saving stations on the coast.

In regard to the service at points along the Chesapeake bay and the coast in the district which includes this locality the board has the following to say Some ditticulty and much delay were ex perienced in acquiring title to the land need ed for b'ulding a wharf and roadway a Hog Island. The deed was not executed un til January, 1103, and the title had not been finally passed upon by the rnited State attorney up to the date of his resignatiot in April. His successor is now engaged upon a review of the papers, and it is ex pected that a decision will soon be had Meanwhile plans for the proposed whar have been prepared, so that there may b< no unnecessary delay after the site shal have been secured. The plans for a struct ure of the same class as that at Cape Charles, Va., to be built of iron, had al ready been completed. Contracts were mad for both these structures, and the construc tion of the ironwork was commenced. Ne gotiations are progressing for the acquisi tion of a new site for the Hog Island ligh station. The owner of the needed land of fers to exchange it for the present ligh house tract, although it is inferior In value It is jecommended that Congress be asked to grant the necessary legislation to au thorize the exchange, as the governmen will be benefited thereby. By act approved March 3, 18493, Congress appropriated $1U,ul) for replacing by a first-order light th< fourth-order light now at Hog Island, and authorized contract therefor to the amoun of $125,u10.
