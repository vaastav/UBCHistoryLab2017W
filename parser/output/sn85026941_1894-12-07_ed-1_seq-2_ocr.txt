Washington, D. C. De 3.?Tao following is a 1700pm of the message seut to Congress bv the President today: The messago begins with a review of our foreign relations. In sptakiug of J ?pan, tho Presi ?lent says: "Japan attracts Inoreasing at tisntiou in this country by her evi? dent desire to cultivate more lib eral intercourse wuu us ?nu seek our kindly aid in furtherai of her laudable desire for compl autonomy iu her domestic afta a'nl fall eqi.ility in the family nations. The Japanese empire today is no longer the Japan of I past, aud our relations with t progressive uatioa should not less broad aud liberal than the with other powers." Appropriate reference is mn to the assssslaatioo of the Pre dent of France and to the death the C/. tr of Russia. Toe President takes up the i ports of tho varions depaitmei and discusses them ct length. T first repori is that ot the Secreta of the Treasury, aud the Preside sus: '-The Secretary ot the Trei" ury reports that the receipts the government from all sources revenue daring the fiscal year en? ing June 39th,. 1894, a i o .in ted : 1172.803,488,28, and its exnenc ture to $442,6 ?"> T"?> 87, leaving dificit ct $69,803,260,53. Thei wssa decrease of $15,952,674.66 the ordinary expenses of the go em ment as compared with th fiscal year 1693. There was collected Irom en toms $131,818,530,62 and from ii terual revenue $147,168,449,7 The balance of the income tor tl year amounting to $93,815l662,f was derived irom the sales of laut] and other sources. It estimated that upon the basi ot the preseut revenue laws the r< ceipts ot the government during the current fiscal year endinj June 30, 1895, will be $424 427, 74S, 11. its expenditures $.44,427, 748,44, resulting in a deficit o $20,000.000. On the first day of November 1894, the total stock of money o money of all kinds m the countn was $3,240,743,880 igiinst ?-,204. 651,000 on the first ?lay of Novem ber, I893j and the money of all kinds in circulation, or not included iu the treasury holdings, was $1,* 672,093 122, or $24 27 per oapital upon an estimated population of 68,887,000. At the same da'e there held in tho treasury gold bullion amounting to $44,615,177,. ?j.j and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $127,779,988. Fifty national banks were or? ganized during the year ending October 18,1894, with a cipital of $6.285,090 and seventy-nine with a capital of $10,475,000 went into voluutary liquidation. Twenty one binks with a capital of $2,770, 000 were placed in the hands of receivers. Tne total number of banks in existence on the 31st ?lay of October last was 3,756, being tuity lees than on the31st day ol October, 1893. The total resources of the banks ?it tne date mentioned amounttd to $3,473,922,005 as against ?o.iuu-ich tu iu lovo. Id concluding bis message, the President reverts to the c irrency question and deplores the oondit* i m which depleted the gold reserve. Speaking ot the recent bind issue, be adds that there was no other remedy at hand, and serves notice on Congress and the business world that he will exercise this perogative whenever it Isnecessary to protect the credit of the gov? ernment. (gestions relating to our haul and currency are closely connecte with the subject referred to an and they also present ?mue onsatii factory features. Promiuent! among them is the lack of ela*t citv In our currency circula!io and its frequent concentration i financial centres when it is mo? needed in other parts of the c Kin try . The secretary of the treai ury presents in his report a Sohem tnotiltving the pre.? e it bankin laws aud providing fur the is; a? o circulatiou notes by S'a'e bank Iree from taxation under eertaii limitations. Ile gives Secret?ry Uarlisle': plans bis unqualiii >d endorseraout It proposes to repeal all laws pro? viding for the deposit of Unitei States bonds anl secirity fir circulation, to permit naliona bauks to issne circulating notei not exceeding in amount 7,~? j? ?r cent, on their paid op an] uiiini paired capita', provided thej deposit with the government as a guarantee fond United State? legal teuder notes, including treas? ury notes ot 18!>0, a sum eq aal iu amount to 30 per cent, of the uotes tbea to issue, this deposit theu to be maintained at all times. I Bat whenever any bank retires any part ot its circulation a pro? portional part of its guarantee fund shall be returned to it to permit Secretary ot the treasury to repare and keep on band n i 

ISMS in case increase m alatlons Is desired, blank n.ti ank notes for ench batiK ha irculatioii and to repeal the isions ef the present law lropc imitations and restrictions i ?auks desiring to reduce 01 treaae their ciiculation, tbus nitting euch increase or redui ritbin the limit of scventj ier cent, of capital to be qui nade as emergencies arise. In addition to the guara 'rid nqired it is proposed provide a safety fund for this Mediate redemption of the cirt ;ing notes of failed b.u,ks by posing a small an-iual tax, say half of one per cent, upon average circulation of each b until the fund amounts to five cent of the total circulation standing. When a bank fails guarantee fuud is to be paid this t-afe'y fuud, and its notes to be redeemed in the first inst? from such safety lunds tbus ? mentad. Any impairment of g fuud caused thereby to be m good from the immediately av?i ble cash assets of said bank, i if those should be insufficient 8 i npairment to be made good ratio assessment among ot banks per their contributions c stltnting a first lion upon the as: o? the failed bank in favor of I contrib.iting bnik-i. As a futtber security it is o templateJ th.it the existing f vision fixing it the Individ liability of stock hoi lers Is to retained, and the bank's ludebt ness 0:1 accouat of its circul?t^ notes is to be made first lien on its assets. For the purpose printing uotes, officia! sapervisn cancellation andothci like charg there shall 1)3 imposed a tax of g one-hall of one por cent per anna upon the average anoint of not in circulation. It is farther provided that the shall ba no national baak notes sued of less denomination tii ten dollars, That each nation bank, except in case of a fail? bank, shall redeem or retire i notes in the first instance at i own office, or at agencies to 1 designated by it, and that no fUe reserve need be maintained on a< count of deposits. Another very important featui of this plan is that each mention < Itate banks from taxation by th United States in cases where it 1 shown to the satisfaction of th Secretary ot the Treasury am Comptroller of the Carrency, b; banks claiming such exemption that they have not had outstand ?ng their circulating notes exceed ?ng TO per cent of their paid up an? unimpaired capital, and tht.ii stockholders are individually habit for the redemption of their circula tion notes to the fall extent ol their ownership ot stock; that th? liability of said banks upon then circulating notes constitutes, under their state law, a first lien upon tbt-i? assets; that such banks have kept and maintained a guarantee tnnd in United States legal tend?*r notes, including treasury notes of 1890, cqial to thirty per cent of their 0 itstaudiugcirculating notes when presented at their principal or branch offlc S. it is quite likely that this scheme nay be usefully amended in some of its detail's, but lam sati tiled it furnishes a basis for a very great improvement in our present bank? ing and currency system. The President deals briefly but vigorously with taiiff aud sugar. IIesa\s: "The tarif! act passed at the list session of the Congress needs important ?amendments if it 18 to be executed effectively and with certainty. In addition to such n ? essary amendments as will not change rates of duty, I am still veiy decidedly in favor of potting ooaland iron un.m the tree list. Si fiir as the sugar schedule is concerned, I would be glad, under existing aggravations, to see every p.irtic'e of differential duty iu favor of refinid sugar stricken out of our tariff law. I earnestly repeat here the recommenilation I have made in another portion of this com? munication, that the additional duty of oue-teuth of ? cent per pound,laid upon sugar imported fiom countries paying a bounty on' its export, be abrogated.'' Tni8is about lhe only recommend? ation made as to tarif! legislation, except that our new tarif! policy, by whieb we are to have closer relations with the rest of the world, must be supplemented by the greatest possible liberty to oor citizen, ?ill] tho owuerahip and navigation of ships in wbL-? oir products may be tiausported. He therelora earnestly recommends that the "ancient provisions of our law denying American registry to ships built abroad an i owned by Americans" be repealed. Japanese Has Decided. Vakohama, Dec. 3.?It is said un-oflicially that Japan has decided to insist upon heavy ?onlitions of paace. It concluded at the present time Japan would accept an indem? nity of four hundred million yen and the cession of tbe territory now occupied by her forces. Freo Suger. Tjo Sew V irk Wot'd "Th**re is i ot oui., ?i polities!, but a moral daty resting up m the Seua?e to pass the bill already passe?! by the II ?use placing sugar on the free l :v. "The democratic principle and policy in regard to every article, ot universal use sbonld be once fr? e, always free. To retax s p ime necessity of tho people entering into the consumption of evert family in the land, cann it be j istifi'<1 while any revenue yield* lug luxuries are untixed or bit lightly taxed. ?'A tax upan sugar is as in? escapable and as burdenssme -is would be a tux upon Boot. Sagar costs more than any other article of food used by our peopls. At wholesale prices the cost la more thin $200,000,006 a year. To enlian :e the price of this prime necessary by a tax, as eveu the protectionists admit to be tho re? sult, is therefore poor politics, bad statesmanship aud false economy. Nothing hurt the democrats more iu the recent elections than the restoration of tho tax on sugar, and especially the way in which it was done. "Aud this brings up the stron? gest reason for completing the passage of tbo free sugar bill. Far greater thin Hi?! eootni-J princ involve?! is tho moral obligation to wipe out the shame and the dis? grace of that transaction. The national honor is above pirfcy ex? pediency or treasury needs." The Constitutional Amendments. T ie canvassing boar?! of the State iu Richmond concluded the examination ol the returns from the vote upon tho amendment to the constitution, which empowerf, the Legislature to rehabilitate jus? tices of the peace with authority to try latcecy and other petty c 'fuere were 108.885 votes cast in favor of the amendment, and L'l, 841 against it. The only two coun? ties that gave negative majorities were B ich inan and Dickinson. Governor O'Forrall will issue s proclamation declaring the an end* ment adopted, but the Legislature will ha.e to enact a law restoring to magistrates tho powers that they exercised prior to the Su? preme Court decision of a few years ago which declared the act unconstitutional.
