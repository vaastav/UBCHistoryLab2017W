The United States was again frequently referred to dur ing the tariff debate in the Reichstag to-day. Herr Speck (centrist) said; "We are asked, what shall Germany do without American cotton? I ask, what will the United States do with its cotton? Without an American market we have no more interest in American friendship than America has in ours. I am far removed from desiring ft tariff war with the United States, but we must preserve our self-respect. We do not need foreign countries. Who shall stand the damages if no commercial treaties are made with the United States? Clearly, the United States."

Yale's debaters were Joslah Sibley, 1902, Robert H. Ewell, 1903, and Charles iD. Lockwood, 1903. s Princeton argued that the existing conditions made the adopltion of the amendment inevitable' and that its adoption had accomplished its object. Yale argued that the amendment was absolutely unnecessary and was pro ductive of evils far more weighty than the good it had sought to accomplish, 1 The Judges, in announcing their de cision, said that the debate was very ' closely contested. In the opening speeches the teams were evenly match ed, but on the rebuttals Yale was su perior. Throughout the debate, too, her speakers showed better form than that of the Princeton men. In these debates Yale and Princeton have each won four. In one debate no decision was rendered. NOT 

GENERALLY SO FRIENDLY. Comment of London Weeklies on the President' Message. London, Dec. 6. The comment of the weeklies on President Roosevelt's mes sage to congress is not generally so friendly as that of the dailies. The Speaker devotes the entire space to acrid comment on the trust references. The paper 'declares the president's treatment of a grave, economic situa tion is trivial in form and unsatisfac tory in substance, adding: "We did not entertain a genuine be- lief In the goodness, of the president's intentions, we should regard his diag nosis of the industrial situation as in sincere." The Speaker's word picture of the widespread ruin, corruption economic, tyranny and domestic affiliation brew ing over in America as the result of trust domination would be a revelation to the most ardent anti-trust advocate In the United States. The article con cludes as follows: ' "For such a student of Industrial poli tics as Mr. Roosevelt professes to be to ignore these conditions is an act of in tellectual daring that does him little credit. The upshot of the message is to minimize and misrepresent the dan gers of trusts and to postpone any se rious attempt to grapple with them." The Saturday Review, on the other hand, remarks:. "All industrial undertakings in the United States are more scientifically organized than in any other country as we have learned to our cost. The trust Is the last word of this system of scien tific organization and the president is right when he declines to hamper the captains of industry." Turning to the canal treaty, however, the Saturday Review declares that Great Britain has sacrificed everything to gain the problematical friendship of the United States, which will last just so long as It takes America to build 'a fleet, and not a day beyond." The Outlook is mildly commendatory of the message. It says: "The anarchist programme is splen did in theory, but in practice it is im possible." As regards reciprocity, the Outlook remarks: "Frankly selfish America will accept freely whatever benefits herself, but will be careful that no infant Industry " is squeezed out of the perambulator," Woman Indicted for Triple Murder. Barnstable. Mass., Dec. 6. Miss Jane Toppan has been indicted by the grand .Jury for the alleged murder of Mrs. Mary E. Gibbs, Alden P. Davis and Mrs. Genevieve A. Gordon at Cataumet, Mass., in July and August this year. There are four counts to each indict ment. The indictment charges the use of morphine, antrophine and a poison unknown to the jurors rious items of non-recurrent and extra ordinary expenditure. The revenue side of the account in cludes a supplementary loan of 35,000,000 marks. An accompanying explanatory statement notes a considerable deflct, and says that owing to the financial po sition of the indlivdual states of the empire it is impossible to have recourse to matricular contributions to cover the 58,000,000 marks required. Therefore, it is deemed advisable to provide only 24, 000,000 marks, by an increase of the matricular contributions, and to pro vide the remainder out of the above mentioned loan.

Introduced by California Represeufa tlve To Prevent Frauds. Washington, Dec. 6. Representative Kahn, who represents the San Fran cisco district, containing the Chinese quarter, in which some 30,000 Chinese reside, introduced a Chinese exclusion law to-day. It defines etrlctly the status of those who by treaty have a right to enter the country, excluding all except Chinese officials, teachers, students, merchants, travelers and re turning laborers. In each of these ex cepted cases, a section provides for the rigid identification and specification of the excepted persons. In the case of Chinese officials the Chinese govern ment is required to furnish a list of its officials who may come to this country. Mr. Kahn says that this will prevent the wholesale creation of officials, In cluding those of the Six Companies, who are said to have been appointed officials in order that they might be outside of the exclusion laws. Court DecSlues to Quash the Indictment for Murder. New York, Dec. 6. Judge Newburger handed down a decision In the court of general sessions to-day denying a mo tion to dismiss the Indictment for mur der against Roland B. Molineux. The motion was to quash the Indictment, or as an alternative for leave to Inspect the minutes of the grand jury. Both applications were denied. Mollneux's attorneys alleged that evidence intro duced before the grand Jury concern ing what are known as the Barnet let ters was improper under the decision of the court of appeals, which set aside the conviction of Molineux. The judge in denying the motion held that the court of appeals had no power to direct a final judgment and that It had exer cised this power by directing that a new trial must take place. As to the application for right to in spect the minutes Judge Newburger held that that branch of the motion had been disposed of adversely by Judge Blanchard when application was made before him by the defendant. No leave having been obtained to renew the motion and now new facts having been stated It could not be entertained at this time. INTERESTING STATE ITEMS.

Washington, Dec. 6. The war depart ment made public the first annual re port of Major General Adna R. Chaf fee, military governor of the Philip pine Islands, to-day. General Chaffee sums up the situation in the Philippines from a military standpoint by saying that the provinces of Batangas and Laguna, in Luzon and the islands of Samar, Mlndoro, Cebu and Bohol con stitute the area disturbed now by any embodied force of insurgents. He says that the prolongation of guerilla warfare is due to tfce physical charac ter of the country, the treacherous na ture of the warfare of the rebels, the humanity of the troops, which is taken advantage of by the rebels and those who sympathize with them, and the fear of assassination on the part of the friendly disposed if they give Informa tion to the American forces. Commenting upon the plan of gradu ally replacing military for civil admin istration General Chaffee says: "The withdrawal of interference with civil affairs doea not contemplate with drawal of troops from their stations to any considerable extent; on the con trary, this should not be done hastily and when undertaken should be gradual and more in the nature of concentration than reduction of force or abandon ment of any considerable area of terri tory." He therefore recommends that there be no further material reduction of troops before January, 1303. The civil governments which are being or ganized provincial and municipal General Chaffee ?ays are both new and untried and there la but one certain method of ascertaining the progress of the Filipinos in self government, name ly, observation by the army. On the subject of military government of the city of Manila, Geenral Chaffee says: "In the government of Manila for three years, If the military have done nothing more, it is everywhere appar ent that an excellent foundation has been laid and a turbulent and hostile community brought to observe the laws and individually be orderly: this has been done without due harshness or severity of treatment of . the inhabit ants." In anticipation ot a partial concen tratlon of the troops in the Philippines next year General Chaffee submits es tlmates for the construction of quar ters and barracks. He recommends that a permanent post be constructed at once in the vicinity of Manila for the accommodation of a garrison of two squadrons of cavalry, two batteries of artillery and two full regiments of Infantry, together with a hospital and storehouse, the whole to be under the command of a brigadier general. He gives $500,000 as a rough estimate of cost for this project, and says that $200,0(0 61 ould be available Immediate ly in order that full advantage may be taken of the dry season. For the con struction of permanent quarters at other points which may be determined upon during the fiscal year ending June, 1903, he estimates that $2,000,000 Is required. General Chaffee devoted considerable of his report to the terrible disaster which befell Company C, Ninth infan try, at Balanglga, Samar. This, he eays, "was largely due to over confi dence In assured pacified conditions and in a people who to a great extent as yet are strangers to and unappre ciative of our humane and personal liberty, beliefs and actions." American soldiers, he says, fail to discriminate between real and assumed friendship on the part of the Filipinos. A table shows that from June 10, last, the date of the last table submitted by General MacArthur, up to September 15, 361 Filipino officers and 3,638 men surrendered to the American military and 26 officers and 494 men were cap tured. In an appended report, General J. P. Sanger, inspector general of the di vision of the Philippines, eays of the discipline of the troops in the islands that there has been a commendable absence of excesses and serious infrac tions of the regulations, but there is great room for improvement in dress, demeanor and signs of respect In salut ing superior officers, the criticism ap plying to officers as well as soldiers. Judge Advocate General Groesbeek says that the suppression of brigand age in the Philippines will be one. of the trying problems of the future like ly. If the military arm were left free to deal with the marauders, he says, there would be no doubt of their final eupppression, but the incoming of a civil government complicates the situa tion very considerably. Great attention is paid in appended reports to the subjects of the preva lence of venereal diseases in the army uf the Philippines, the vigorous meas ures taken to segregate dissolute wo men and rigid physical inspection, for guarding against the spread of such diseases. General Chaffee also submits the re ports of the commanders of the military departments in the Philippines and those of the heads of the several staff departments. 'I ' A T THE
