GRAT BEAT OF 1ARNElO EE History of the Project Which Now Approaches Success. DETAILS NOT ANNOUNCED Mr. Andrew Carnegie has sent a letter to President Roosevelt announcing his de sire to bestow a gift of $10.000,000 upon the gcvernment or perhaps some corporate es tablishment for the purpose of creating and maintaining an institution for higher learn ing In this city, to be known or to have the proportions of a national university. The details of the project have not as yet been disclosed, for the letter remains in the possession of the President, not having been officially communicated to any one outside of a small circle of those concerned In the success of the enterprise. It is ex pEcted that it will be presented to Congress for appropriate legislative action. A mes sage from the President to this effect is re garded as imminent. There is no absolute certainty as to the amount named by Mr. Carnegie. but that stated above is believed to be correct. At the cabinet meeting today the Presi dent formally announced to the cabinet members that he hid received the letter from Mr. Carnegie to this effect. and that be proposed to consult with members of Congress concerning the matter before any formal statement of the case was given to the public or communicated to the houses, ThE understanding is that the President hopes to prepare the way for a prompt ac tion by Congress on the legislative phase of the affair and to insure immediate prog ress along the lines indicated by Mr. Car negie in his letter. The suggestion is also hd out today that the President and Mr. Carnegie will consult further concerning th , precise features of the project. th?lat t-r visiting Washington In all probability In the course of a few days for that pur Mr. Carnegie's gift to the government, as it -nust for the present be considered, is for the purpo-se. it is understood, of permitting the fruition of the plans which have been discussed for many years for the establish ment of some form of governmentally supervised educational establishment in this city. George Washingtm left a fund for this purpose. and there is now in ex ist: nee an organization known as the George Washington Memorial Association, whose purpose is the development of the original plan. enlarged according to modern i4icas. One result of the formation of this association was a move by the Washington Academy of Sciences, two years ago, to conserve all the forces which have been striving for the creation of a national uni versity at Washington. The academy, through its leading officers. secured the co operation of the leading educators of the country to a plan for the establishment here of a post-graduate institution which sh,,uld utilize all the governmental agencies and scientific bureaus for the higher educa tion of students. Mr. Carnegie lnterested. The present understanding is that the work of the academy, which was promi nently in evidence a few months ago when the matter was discussed before the Na tional. Educational Association, attracted the attention of Mr. Carnegie, who, it is further understood, has for some years en tertained a thought of providing for some form of national university at Washington. lie consulted, it is known, with several in timate friends, educators of prominence, foremost among whom was Andrew D. White. once president of Cornell apd, now ambassador to Germany. Others consulted by Mr. Carnegie were President Eliot of Harvard and former President Daniel C. Gilman of Johns Hopkins. Dr. Gilman is the present head of the in stitution whith was projected a few months ago as a result of an agreement between the Academy of Sciences and the Memorial Association. He has been engaged for some time in formulating plans for the-further anee of the enterprise, and he and Mr. Car negie held several interviews, at which, it is stated. the subject of the projected uni versity eas carefully discussed. Consulted With the President. About ten days ago Mr. Carnegie lunched with President Rooseve' at the White House. The subject of ; national univEr sity was broached and Mr. Carnegie d!s closed his desire to forward the enterprise by an endowment donation. It is probable that it was on that occasion that the mat ter took definite shape. Mr. Carnegie has now, as stated, submitted his plan in the letter to the President. According to one who is closely identified with the project of establishing a higher educational insti tution here, the subject has not until now been laid in a business-lIke manner before a business man with the means of Mr. Car regie to put it upon a practical basis for execution. His letter, It is understood, con tains the precise proposition of how the fund is to be managed and expended for the establishment of the university. Carroll D. Wright. commissioner of labor. who has been associated with the work of the Academy of Sciences in this direction, stated today to a Star reporter'that the subject was as yet vague, as far as the puoieations are concerned. He added: The Original Plan. 'The general discussion which has been carried on during the last twenty-five years in relation to the establishment of ana tional university in Washington. has culimi nated in a magnifleent plan and endow mnent by Mr. Andrew Carnegie. For a num ber of years the universty~ idea held sway, but about two years ago the matter was taken up by the Washington Academy of Sciences and this body, in co-operation with the George Washington Memorial As sociation, formulated a definite plan, which differed radically from the university plan contemplated in the earlier years. This re uu!:.d last spring, as was then published in The Star, in the organization of the Wash ingto~n Memorial Institution. The plan was, in brief, as follow.: "The organization of a private foindation, independent of government support ora con trol, to facilitate the use of the scientific and other resources of the government for research, and to co-operate with universi ties, colleges and individuals in securing to Properly qualified persons opportuxwjtle4- for advanced study and research. Dr. Daniel C. Oilman, until lately president of Johns Hopkins University, was elected director of-the institution. When Mt' Carnssie came to consider the questIon of esjdo.irig a nationail university at' Washiliori he invrestigated the whole subjeCt- With Als usuali thoroughness, and found- that -an. in stitution devoted to reeearch and-the tran ing of capable persons was miove' in adeotd with his conceptions than JM. -l~s at of a universitj that tot his a rla of the already existIng u M1M~Ws of the eountry.

Cm~~gm mig nsbauo2Iite peeps g new institution Is known nothing can be definitely determined." Undetermined Features. The natural Irquiry of those who have long desired such an institution for Wash irgton now is whether this endowment will result in a physical establishment, a sepa rate Institution, or will be merely an as semblage of specialits who shall guide students In the use of the various facilities for education here to be found. There is as yet nothing definite on which this question can be answered. The logical assumption, however, is that there will be some form of establishment from which the work of the university will be administered, perhaps In course of time a series of heuism for the accommodation of the students. It is as sumed that the letter of Mr. Carnegie will clearly Indicate the manner of institution he desires. with full suggestions of the scope of the work. It is understood that those closely identified with the project are some what disturbed over the premature an nouncement of the gift, as they had hoped that Mr. Carnegie's letter to the President would be the first medium of the announce ment, thus preventing much unnecessary speculation and many misstatements. The best understanding of the case Is that Mr. Carnegie proposes that the fund shall be administered by the United States in much the same manner as is that which founded the Smithsonian Institution, with a board of regents In charge of the actual supervision over the finances and the gen eral policies of the establishment. Favored at the Capitol. Mr. Carnegie's proposition is favorably received by senators and representatives, and no doubt Is expressed in relation to the att:tude of Congress toward this proposi tion in the form in which it has been an nounced. If It involves no expense for the government, and only calls for a trustee ship on the part of the government, it is improbable that any question will arise of any consequence in regard to the accept ance of the donation. Not only is this the prevai..ng opinion of prominent senators and representatives, but the proposition is very timely, in view of the fact that the park commission has in its very extensive plan reserved a space as especially appro priate for such a semi-public institution. This space is regarded as admirably adapted to such a great university, as It is centrally located and has ample room for adminis tration buildings, which are all that would be needed, it Is understood, In carrying out the plan contemplated. A Site Contemplated. This area is located south of the square on which the Corcoran Art Gallery is built and is between 17th and 18th and B and D streets northwest. It is 530 feet by about 1,500 feet deep. It would give a magnificent opportunity for any architectural display that might be contemplated in the construc tion of the buildings, for the reason that at present public parks exist both east and south of this site, and it is understood that the plans of the park commission contem plate additional parking space west of this tract of ground. A further advantage of such a site would be enjoyed in the possession of surround ings particularly appropriate for such a great institution, which, in the course of a reasona'oe time, it is believed, would ac commodate at least 1,000 students. These would be young men, probably from twenty-four to thirty years of age, and they would find several hundred yards to the south of the proposed site for the university a gymnasium and a bathing beach, If they desire to use them, and provided the plans of the park commission are carried out. Much Discussion Probable. It is thought likely that the acceptance of this donation by Congress will prove the source of a great'ldeal of discussion in relation to the management of such a great university. It is understood that the terms on which this proposition has been ap proved by the presidents of the great uni versities of the United States Is that it shall have its courses so arranged that their graduating students can take advan tage of them and then return to the uni versity from which they entered the great university at Washington, in order to re ceive their degrees. In other words, the students in going to the University of the United States from Harvard, Yale, Prince ton or any of the other great schools would not lose their connection with the univer sity from which they came.. One of the most Important features of this proposed university of the United States would be Its close alliance with all the scientific departments -of the United States government, which would, in fact, form one of the most helpful educational features connected with the institution. There are a dozen or more of these depart ments or bureas in this city, and It is likely that the establishment of an university of the United States here would be of mate rial assistance in the development of these scientific bureaus of the government. The standardizing bureau, the coast and geo detic survey, the army engineers' school, the geological survey, the Library of Con gress. the scientific bureaus of the Depart ment of Agriculture, the bureau of educa tion and others would form valuable ad juncts to this university. The Amount of the Endowment. While $10,000,000 is a very large sum of money, yet those who are acquainted with the great educational Institutions of this country do not regard It as at all sufficient to.establish such an institution on a basis that will give it a world-wide standing. It has been stated that this sum of money is equal to the endowment of Harvard Uni versity, for instance. While that is true, yet Harvard. It is said, in its buildings and grounds used by the institution, has prop erty In Itself worth probably $20,009,000. in addition to that Harvard University has about 4.000 students, and each of these stu derts is worth S150 per annum to the uni versity. This gives an enormous income. so that it Is probable that the $10,000,000 donated by Mr. - Carnegie for this purpose would have to be supplemented Iii order to make the great university to be founded by him adequate to' the great educational re quirements that would be expected from it. But this fact Is not regarded as of any con siderable consequence by those who are friendly to the suggestion, as there is a very firm feeling that the remainder of the assistance that the university will need will be readily forthcoming in the course of time.. Prejeet Lema Urged. The establishment of a university of the United States has so long been discussed in Congress that it is well understood in alU Its salient features. The project has been reported upon favorably by committees in several Congresses and It has been strongly urged as a mesure that ought to be adopt ed because of the national pride of a great nation which has to send Its advanced stu dents to foreign countries in order to secure educational facilities that are not available within the United States. The committee to establish the university of the United States, of which Senator Kyle was cair man, speaking of this project in its' report In 1806> said: "To those giving a thought-to the unpar alleled progress of nations in this close of the nineteenth century . there wlrnd seem to be no question as to the need of sqpb an institution in the United States, a is contemplated in this bill. The spirit of the age calls for deeper penetration Into the sciences and arts- and demands better equipped men. -Why should not the United States, the cradle of liberty, and the leeder of enlightened abristendom contribute her share to the advancement of mannkind? Why should we bsrroir modern edueational methods from Europe and p~nat fnnie~ institutions? Why shnia ~ fi here an Institution whidh ~ pride and patristism of aeia and furnbh. faan~ts s~aae I world for the extenion ofhiWe., 

AGREED ON A BILL Repdblican Members of the Ways and Meana Committee, DhMS ON PHILUPPII PROMCT Ho Concessions on G ad.Cw' ing From the Island REGARDED AS SIGNIFICANT A Philippine tariff bill was agreed upon by the republican members of the House ways and means committee today. The bill was subsequently introduced in the House by Chairman Payne, and will later be con sidered by the full committee and reported to the House. The bill in full is as follows: "An act temporarily to provide revenue for the Philippine Islands, and for other purpoqgs. "Be it enacted ,y the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of an act entitled 'An act to re vise and amend the tariff laws of the Phil ippine archipelago,' enacted by the United States Philippine commission on the 17th day of September, 1901, shall be and remain in full force and effect. Establishing Dingley Rates. "Section 2. That on and after the passage of this act there shall be levied, collected and paid upon all articles imported into the United States from the Philippine archi pelago the rates of duty which are required to be levied, collected -and paid upon like articles imported from foreign countries. Tonnage Taxes. "Sec. 3. That on and after the passage .of this act thesame tonnage taxes shall be levieti, collected and paid upon all vessels coming into the United States from the Philippine archipelago which are required by law to be levied, collected and paid upon vessels com ing into the United States from foreign countries: Provided. however, that until the 1st day of January, 1905, 'the provisions of law restricting to vessels of the United States the transportation of passengers and merchandise directly or indirectly from one part of the United States to another part of the United States shall not be applicable to foreign vessels engaging in trade between the Philippine archipelago and the United States. To Go Into Philippine Treasury. "Sec. 4. That the duties and taxes collect ed in the Philippine archipelago in pursu ance of this act, less the cost of collecting the same, and the gross amount of all col lections of duties and taxes in the United States upon articles imported from the Philippine archipelago and upon vessels coming therefrom, shall not be covered into the general fund of the treasury of the United States, but shall be held as a sep arate fund and paid into the treasury of the Philippine Islands to be used and expended for the government and benefit of said is lands. "Sec. 5. That when duties prescribed by. this act are based upon .the weight. of mer chandise deposited in any public or private bonded warehouse, said duties shall be levied and collected upon the weight of such merchandise at the time of its entry. Drawback. "Sec. 6. That all articles manufactured in bonded manufacturing warehouses, in whole or in part, of Imported materials, or of materials subje't to Internal revenue tax, and intended for eiportation from the United States to the Philippine Islands, and all articles subject to internal revenue tax and Intended for exportation from the United States to the Philippine Islands, shall, when so exported, under such regu lations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, be exempt from internal revenue tax, and shall not be charged with duty except the duty levied under the act upon imports into the Philippine Islands." Maintaining Open Door Poliey. Several propositions were considered by the.committee and defeated before the bill was agreed upon. One was the clause of fered by Mr. Russell of Connecticut, as pub lished In The Star yesterday, providing for a preferential tariff. Und;er it there would have been a reduction of 20 per cent on the trade between the Philippines and the United States, Mr. Russell claiming it was necessary to offset the advantages now en joyed by foreign countries. Tke proposition was voteddown upon the score that a pref erential tariff would violate the spirit of the "open-door" trade policy in the orient, for which this country has been contending. It was next suggested to remove the ex port tax on goods going to the United States. The Taft commission tariff provides a tax on all exports of sugar, tobacco, rice, indigo, hemp, cocoanuts and manu:factures. It was urged that the export tax was not in accord with the spirit of the Constitution. It was decided, however, not to remove it on any merchandie. Blow to Reciprocity With Cuba. In the opinion .of some members of the ways and means commIttee the course de cIded upon by the committee today ef fectually puts an end to the prospect of concessions to Cuba in the tariff on sugar and tobacco. It Is claimed that if it is not desirable to grant concessIons to fterritory under the control of the United States it cannot be successfuly argued that conces sion should bd gie a foreign country soon to be an indepnent nation. However, the eenmittee weill give a hear ing to the Cuban reciprocity -advocates after the holidays. To Establish a idbeary Poet.
