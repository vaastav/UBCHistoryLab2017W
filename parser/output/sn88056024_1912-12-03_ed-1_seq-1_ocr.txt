Came as Surprise. The case came as a complete surprise to the defendants. Talk had been heard during the campaign that the supreme court had under consideration a cits tlon for contempt because of some of the publications In this paper, but these were dismissed as Idle rumors fre quently started during campaigns and no attention was paid to the talk. The Idea that no such action was contem plated by the court was further em phasized when some days ago Justice Allshle of the supreme sought an Inter view with the business manager and sought to ascertain what would be the attitude of the Capital News toward his candidacy for United States senator. It was not until the citation was served upon Mr. Sheridan, who received 1» first, that any Intimation became known that a suit of the character was under consideration.

MESSAGE SEHT OH FOREIGN POLICY President Tatt Tells Congress of Nation's TRADE EXPANSION IS THENE IN MESSAGE Attention Called to Neces sity for Action in Oases Where Barriers Have Been Raised Against American Goods. • • • o • • • • • m • Message la Read. Washington, Dec. 8 . — Presi dent Taft's first message to the last session of congress In his term was received with close at tention by both branches when the legislative business began today. Dealing entirely with foreign relations and America's commercial progress in foreign trade the mesage paved the way for others dealing wtth big questions In legislation and government. Washington, Dec. 3.—A note of warn ing to European powers which by In direct means continue to discriminate' against American trade; a strong ap peal to the congress to uplift ffiè great foreign policies of America above mere questions of partisanship; a tri umphant vindication of the diplomacy of the administration, which Is charac terized as that of "dollars versus bul lets"; a masterful pride In the enor mous expansion of American trade as a result of the foreign policies of hls administration; and an earnest appeal for joint action by congress and the executive to open new markets for American Industries—these are the more striking features of President Taft's fourth annual message sent to congress today. The message Is the first of a aeries of euch communications which he will make to congress In the early days of the session, and deals entirely with the foreign relations of the United States. Beginning with the usual ref erence to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the president adds that these have been strengthened by "A greater Insistence upon Justice tor American cltlsens, or interests, wher ever It may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need of mu tuality in commercial and other rela tions." Reaeon for Warning. For the first time In Its history says the president the state department has obtained substantially the most Savored nation treatment from all of the coun tries of the world. Therefore, he says that It Is only natural that the com petitive countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning, "If In some Instances, the measures taken by them to meet It are not entirely equit able, a remedy should be found." To this end, the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the government. Instead of Imposing the full maximum rates of duty against discriminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to that maximum of >5 per cent. "Flat tariffs are out of data," said the president "Nations . no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all nattohs, irrespective of the treatment from them received. • • • It Is very necessary that the American govern ment should be equipped with weapons of negotiation and adapted to modern economic conditions." The state department, "an archaic and Inadequate machine,'' at the be ginning of this administration, the president says, has become a new or ganisation, with highly specialised bu reaus and experts dealing with every phase of American trade and diplo macy. Holding that the essence of this reorganised service le found In th* merit system, wfilch President Cleve land Is credited with having Intro duced, President Taft makes a strong! appeal to congress to make this ma chine permanent, by giving the fore* of statutory law to the executive or dere governing admission to and pro motion in the diplomatic and consu lar services. Appointments Nen'Partisan. To show that these appointments are already largely non-partisan, the president points to the.fact that three of the present am basse dobs are hold, overs; that ot the 10 he has appoint ed, five were by promotion from th* (Continued on Page rtvej
