'Forget Frivolity and Study Hard,' Nethersole's Advice to Girls Seeking a Stage Career SAYS GOOD GIRL NEED NOT PEAR CONSTANT WORK NECESSARY, ACTRESS ASSERTS Temptations Are Fewer Behind the Footlights Than in Other Vocations, Is Her Opinion "Girls who hope to go on the stage should resolve to give up all thoughts of frivolity and make up their minds to study hard." This is the advice that Olga Nether ■ole, the noted actress, who Is coming to Los Angeles soon, gives all would be Heiresses. "Many parents oppose their daugh ters in adopting the career of an ac tress on the ground that the stage Id a place Where the temptations are greater than anywhere else," says Mi.<.-: Nethersole. "To my mind this Is an erroneous Idea and wrong. 'To the pure all things arc pure,' and there is no good reason why a woman should not lead a life as pure and correct on the stage as elaewhcre> ' "If a young woman Is employed In a ■hop she. in all probability, earns a ■-alary not to exceed $10 a week, and the majority of women employed in the shops of the groat cities earn from $4 to $(i weekly. Money—or rather want of money— acknowledged by all students of ethics to be one of the strongest factors In the temptation of young women from the path of virtue. We find the temptation In that re spect far less on the stage than else where, for the very simple reason that a young woman on the stage, even when playing a very small part, will command a salary of from $30 to $40 a week, while her sister, working In a (lose. evil-smelling shop, will draw the munificent salary of, let us say, $6 for f.lx days' daily toll, working from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock In the evening. Good Girls Always Respected "Who, In this cane, do you really think Is subjected to the greater temp tation, the girl who earns enough to support herself in comfort, or the girl who slaves tor barely enough to pay for food and lodging, not to mention the fact that she must be clothed? I think you will agree with me that the girl on the stage has all the advantage up to the present time, and good girls are respected everywhere. "Next comes the question of com panions and surroundings. I have been on the stag* since i was 18 years of age. and Judging from my own ex perience and what I have been told by young women employed In other walks of life, I think 1 am perfectly safe In 1 saying that a young girl commands equally as much respect from actors as she will from the men with whom she Is thrown in contact If employed in store, office or shop she respects herself and her priceless heritage of pure womanhood. "In choosing a profession adaptabil ity must be considered. If you think you are fitted for the stage and have any talent for acting It Is a vocation where the financial reward is greater for women than will be found In any other walk of life. Another thing greatly In favor of the stage is the fact that, with few exceptions, the young women who adopt that profes sion ar» most ambitious to succeed, Yol'NG'S milk-fed poaltry Is selllnK to- Eastern hams are 18c a pound; eastern Apples—Fancy Bellefleurs, 11.11 to $1.75 it follows: liens, 27c a pound; bacon, 22c a pound; smoked ox tongues, a box; Missouri Pippins, $1.75 a box; Colo rs, 3uc a pound; fryers, 35c a 2Sc a pound; best steaks. 15c to 25c a rado Jonathans, $3.25 a box; Arkansas pound.
