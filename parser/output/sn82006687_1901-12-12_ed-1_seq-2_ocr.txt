Saint tjaifg Beacon. LEON A RDTOWN, MD. Thcbsoat Morsijw, Dec. 12, 190). Other Contests. Late Wednesday evening of last week we were informed that notices of contest had been served upon County Treasurer Dent and Com missioner Bailey. We have not seen the notices, but presume they are similar to the one served on Sheriff Thompson. Tbs Commlssiousrs' Court. Tuesday last, the Commissioners' Court reorganised by electing John G. H. Lilburn, president; Waiter B. Dorsey, clerk, and Wm. M. Loker, attorney. There was a good attend ance at the meeting and much inter est was manifested in the proceed ings. Mr. John T. Ballenger, the retiring commissioner, said: ‘‘l have acted for eight years as chair man of this board, and but for an unjust law, might have been oontin-, ued, but my duly elected successor is here now and in severing my con nection with the board I wish to thank the other members for their uniform courtesy and the assistance they rendered me in performing the duties of the position. I am now ready to entertain a motion for the election of my successor as presi dent of the Board. ” Commissioner James U. Bailey nominated John G. H. Lilburn for president; Mr. Ballenger put the motion and declared it carried. On taking the chair, Mr. Lilburn thanked the Board for the honor done h>m and said : “I hope I will fill the bill half as well as Mr. Bal lenger did. ” Commissioner Lilburn and Bowles both expressed their deep regret at parting with Mr. Ballenger and their sorrow that he could not con tinue with the Ixsird. Next, Mr. Lilburn announced that the board would go into execu tive session and asked the public to withdraw. It is reported that the hoard ballotted six times for clerk, Messrs. W. B. Dorsey, Wm. M. Lokerand RClarke Abell receiv ing one vote on each ballot. At a second executive session. Commis sioner Bowles broke the deadlock by voting with Mr. Bailey for Wal ter B. Dorsey and electing him. Mr. looker was elected attorney. The new ap|ioin!ees combine the Jeffersonian qualifications, and are young men. *We wish them a high ly successful administration. Onr Washington Letter. Washimoton, Dec. 9. 1961. Almost simultaneously with the opening of Congress the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the “Fourteen Diamond Rings’’ case, declaring mat the i.'bilippine Islands are an integral {art of the United States and that the provisions of the Dingiey tariff law do not, therefore, apply to shipn ents between the isl ands and the United States. This, of course, leaves the trade absolute ly free and threw the protectionists into paroxysms. With this incentive in view the dilatory methods which usually at tend the first weeks of a new Con gress have been abandoned. Speaker Henderson has already named the members of the Ways and Means Committee and it has held a session with a view to reporting a bill pro viding for tariff regulations bet ween the United Statesand the Philippines. It is believed thatthe bill will simply apply the provisions of the Dingiey tariff without changing any of its rates. The President’s message was re ceived with almost unqualified ap proval by the republicans, and the democrats, while they could detect the erroneous deductions, which are the inevitable concomitant of the ac ceptance of the protection fallacy, in every line that dealt with economic subjects, could not but admire the frank, direct expression trf the in dividual views of theauthor. Apart from the specific economic recom mendations and reasoning the mes sage is an admirable paper. Congress has received the report of the Isthmian Canal Commission and the Senate is m receipt of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. The latter has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations and that com inittee has voted unanimously to re port the convention for the favorable action of the Senate. It will be promptly ratified. Senator Morgan has re-jntroduccd his bill providing for the construction of the Nicaraguan canal in accordance with the recom mendation of the Commission, which favors that route, but to the person who reads carefully between the lines there is reason to suspect that there is, in the promptness with ! which all this is being done, some thing in the nature of a ruse and that it is the hope of the promoters of the canal to bring the owners of j the Panama route to reasonable terms. They now hold out for ap- j proximately $70,0(10,00U more than ' the Commission believes their plant • to be worth. ; The President s advice on the tariff question quite accords with the ' views of the high protectionists of 1 his party and when those congress- j men who have advocated tariff re vision have ventilated theiropinions to an extent which they believe will satisfy their constituents, and per hajs gain for them some concessions in the way of patronage or local ap propriations, they will graciously consent to have their bills buried in committee and will soon forget that * they ever contemplated the heresy 1 of tariff revision—at least until they have to ask their friends at home to re-elect them. The only cloud on the republican sky is the recommendation of Mr. Roosevelt in regard to reciprocity wltn Cuba The President has said that from moral reasons and national interests we are bound to grant ma terial concessions to Cuba The Sugar Trust has promised to add the gentle weight of its persuasive influence to the movement, always provided that there Is no reduction on refined sugar, which, of course, means that the Cuban raw sugar can be bought cheaper by the trusts but the consumer will have to .pay just as much for the refined article; and Senator Lodge has been chosen to i lead the fight in the Senate. Entirely apart from the question of the merits of the President's mes sage as demonstrative statesman ship, etc. , it is an exceptional sue cess from a political standpoint. It has won the approval of the people j and of the capitalists, a by no means easy attainment, and that has in spired in the members of Congress a respect which isngt unmixed with \ fear. They appreciate that a presi- | dent who can at once appeal to both ; people and vested interests is a man who is not easily downed and they are one and all anxious to stand, high in the good graces of the Chief Executive. It is, therefore, safe to predict that his strong recommendation on the subject of Cuban reciprocity will exact far greater consideration than it would have had not the message provedsopopulara document. After all, the only people to be sacrificed are the beet sugar growers and the cane growers and they are not either of them of sucffiient weight in the matterof ballots to compel very much respect from republican Congress men. There is one recommendation in the President’s message which should receive the cordial support of congressmen irrespective of party and that is his appeal for sup)K>rt of the Postmaster General in his efforts to remove the abuses which have crept into the administration of the laws in regard to second-class mail matter. Mr. Roosevelt says that al though second-class matter consti tutes nearly sixty per cent of the mails, out of a total revenue of 111, 631,193 the Post Office Department received only 4,299,445f0r the trans mission of that class of mail. He Ifoes on to say if the pound rate “were limited to the legitimate news papers and periodicals actually con templated by the law no just except ion could betaken.” In his annual report the Post master General deals with this sub ject extensively and cites a single instance erf a publication whose ad mission to the pound rate was not originally contemplated by the fram ers of the law and which cost the government for transportation and handling 15,657,.40 against which the publishers paid postage amount ing to 2,236.88 leaving a net loss to the department of 13,320 per weekly issue. An amusing incident occured the other day. While standing in the anteroom of the President's recep tion room 1 saw a congressman go up to the President us he and Sena tor Lodge came out and say ”1 want to say a word for Mr. Blank who bolds a small office in my district — “ “What?” the President interrupt ed, “Is that infernal scoundrel still there? Yes, I knew him when I was on the Civil Service Commis sion. Yes, I'll remember him,“and be left the amazed legislator and passed out with the Senator.
