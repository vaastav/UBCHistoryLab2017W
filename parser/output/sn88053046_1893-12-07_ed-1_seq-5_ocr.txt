The report that Alfred D. Peoples, of the firm of Fell & Peoples of this city, together with other members of the Peoples family, worojying seriously ill at their home in Christiana hundred, caused their friends this city this morning, and efforts were immediately made to ascertain tho truth of the story. State Detectives W itsil and McVey were informed that some one had placed poison in the well from which Peoples family drank, and that as a re sult of the alleged treachery they wore rendered seriously ill and lying at the point of death. A reporter of The Gazette drove out to tho Peoples mansion shortly bo yesterday, to verify the alleged poisoning.* The s formerly occupied by the late John Peoples, cashier of the Central National Bank, and Is situated a short distance from the Laucastcr turnpike and a mile from Silverbrook station tho Wilmington & Northern railroad.

The prevailing opinion among the family seems to be that it was the food thut contained the poison, but what kind of poison it was is a mystery. .The cook to every dish morning explain the mystery.

There was something about the foot-prints that attracted Mousley's attention. The feet of the maruuders had evidently been muffled, and tied with coarse thread, which loft a peculiar mark in the snow. Having made this discovery, Farmer Mousley traced the foot-prints in the snow to a house bearing tho number 1026 Thatcher street, in the Ninth ward. He then made haste to the office of Justice Smith, who issued a search warrant and placed it in the hands of County Constable Reardon, who went at once to the house.
