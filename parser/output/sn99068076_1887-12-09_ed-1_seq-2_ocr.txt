There is a moral in the 1 ale Atlantf. election that will have application in a general way. Two yeara ag.i the prohi bitionists carried that city by a majority of 200. They then proceeded to enforce the law with quhcard of rigor, invaded private dwellings at unreasonable hours and rumaged around after the uiauflr.r of a foraging party in time of war. No right was respected when the liquor constables were on the scent. Lawsuits multiplied, and much factional bitter ness was inevitably engendered. The pr^Wbitioniats, in their eagerness, went toe "ir and groused a conservative feel ing that, together with the fact that the law would not be enforced iu tpito of them, buried them under an adverse majority of over 1,100 in the county at the Jale election. It is almost certain that the liquor element wiil mistake this vote aa a license for f\ee wtiaky, and, acting accordingly, will inaugerate a reign of recklessness that will later change tie mEjurity to tho other side. In many localities neither the prohi bitionists or the liquor dealers soetn to have any eenae on this questiou. E»ch want all or nothing, and tho resell is a continual excitement and uncertainty that does more harm than good.to the cause of good goveiuieut as well as that of temperance. A recent issue of t'je Cactou Ad or ate in referring to Mr. McBride again as suming control of tlie Mitchell Alan eaid ia substance that "Bob" was at work on his smut machine, to which U-e Moil retorts: "Of what earthly uae sre such sheets as the Advocate, but to spoil good paper? Colorless, insane, idealess to idwy, th# produce lSss rillles in their neighborhood, than a lame tad pole in the Gulf of Mexico. No, they are not vulgar. Tlicy are what Heinrich Hein calls 'anatomical}- Trrtuous,' physic ally anil mentally impotent." The Dell Rapids Tvnn and the Flaudreau Jlerati also, it seems, are indulging insnaae journalistic compliments. Witness the following from the Timet: "In speaking of cur comment upon a certain item taken from the Herald two weeks ago, Bio. Whitman says: 'The Tim,s should bear in mind that smut is not wit and no one will voluntarily enl*r into a contest with a polecat.' We now see our mis take i:: entering into a conteu with Air, and, by the way, he should not 'orget the above quotation himself. You can't tell h'.iw rank a poll-cat is until you atir liiui np. We have stirred and are satis fled." It is painfully evideat that something h-is got to he done for the relief of the children's best friend, Hsnta C'laus. The chimneys, as built to-dsy, cspeci»l!y in Kimbdll and vicinity—some of them be ing nothing bur a section of stove pipe projecting through the roof—are alto gether too small for the jolly old saint's comfort. Just think what a terrible catastrophy it would be for him to get stuck in «ome chimney before he should get half over his route. The thought is terriUe when it ir, consiyvre '. how many disappointed little UOVB and girls there would be. In conversation with the old gentleman late one night this week he said something had got to he done be fore Christmas as he had been increasing in girth steadily while the chimneys ave been shrinking. In many places last year they had to drive Mm down with a sledjs- In the recent prohibition campaign at Atlanta, thousands of hand-bills were circulated by the anti-prohibitionists containing a picture of Abraham Lincoln striking the chains from the slaves. Be low the picture was printed the tollow ug extract from one of Lincolu'e speeches: "Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a eposes of inteuiperac.ee within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of reason, in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and in making crimes out of things that arc not crimes A prohibi tory law strikes a blow at the very prin ciples on which our goverment was* founded. I have always been found laboring to prutcct the weaker classes from the stronger, and I ran never give my consent to such a law as you propose to enact. Until my tongue be silenced in death 1 will continue to fight for the rights of man." They—the one st.ate 'cllows—say it's the office seekers—the politicians—who waft division. So..

When you get down t» the bottom of it you will tind the prime movers in this Aberdeen blowout to be Democratic office holders under a territorial form of goyermcut—every mother's.eon of'em— and who are not interesting themselves i-f this matter to secure Dakota the rights of statehood to, some form, but in stead. to complicate matters to an extent that will but serve to keep her a terri tory as long as possible for their own political aggrandizement. Tkese arc cold facts. President Cleveland submitted the following important appointments to Congress, Tuesday: Lucius Q. C. Lamar, of Mississippi, associate justice of the supreme court of the United States, William K. Vilas, of Wisconsin, aecre tary of the iuterior. Don M. D^jiasan, of Michigan, postmaster general. Charles S. Fairchild, of New York secretary of the treasury. Geo. L. Rivera, of New York, assis tant secretary of the treasury. Slgourney Butler, of Massachusetts, secoud comptroller of the treasury. James W. Hyatt, of Connecticut, United State* treasurer. When it was proposed to rcduco letter postage from three to two cenls it was believed by the opponents of the meas ure that under the reduction there would not be revenue enough from the postal service to meet expenses. It has been found, however, that the net postal rev enue has been greatly inCTe-ised during the i.ast two years, and it is probable that the po&MRcc officials wiil otter bill to congress reducing letter postage tcj one qent. an old felKtir nitmiMl Hwrto, He want out a gunning for larka, Bnt he run it too far. when he shot at Lamar And now there's no business for fcwirkn. —MonwrPross. A few years ago the late Czar of Bus sir began to "nip anarchy in the liud." He kept up the nipping business until he himself was nipped. Then his son laid out the same line of policy. Upon the let ter's recent trip from the German fron tier to his capital he needed,the services of 80,000 Boldiers to watch the railroad track and inspcct each lump of coal used by the engine. Evidently the Rus sian style of nipping buds is not a suc cess. The supreme court of the United States decided the three prohibition cases from Kansas on the fith inst. The court holds that the state has a right to su press the traffic under ita jMilice powers and also without paying damages or compensation to the liouor dealers. This settles the question of the validity of the prohibition law In the affirmative and is an important in.iut gained by .he prohibitionists. The queen of England has very little real power. She has no power of- veto like the American president and no authority in the making of the laws. She can convene or rorogue parlimen!, however, whenever she chooses and can raise a Beet or army by and with the consent of parliment. Bho alone can nnke.appointments to the nobility. She is .he bead of the church. Young and pretty Mrs. Georee Gsoukl stood on her head while passing through Clevoland in a private car with her hus band, the other day. This may look like a rash statement to make, but wc know it is true, because the Cleveland Lender published her picture in that position, and the Leader is one of the most reliable exchanges fiom which we ever pulled a wrapper. During the late prohibition campaign in Atlanta, Georgia, the Atlanta Consti tution presented a curious phrase of journalism. The two editors of the pa per, Mr. Grady and Mr. Howclls. took opposite sides in the question. Their views were both published in their pa per with proper d-istinguishing marks.
