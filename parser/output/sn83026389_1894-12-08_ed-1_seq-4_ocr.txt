En effet, de vaches laitières plus n'en fan dra, le Brosinum Galactodendron les remplace avantageusement, et tout le monde en voudra planter un dans son jardin. Cet arbre est originaire du Venezuela et des montagnes près de Curacao (Amérique du Sud). Il atteint une hauteur de quarante-cinq à quatre vingt dix pieds. Le suc qu'il fournit est analogue au lait, très agréable au goût et en quantité aussi considérable qu'une bonne-vache laitière; il s'ob tient en pratiquant une légère incision dans l'écorce de l'arbre; son goût est celui de la crème sucrée et des plus nourrissant. On peut on boire une aussi grande quantité que l'on veut sans le moindre inconvénient. Suivant l'analyse de ce lait végétal, que viennent de faire des savants chi mistes, sa composition renferme du su cre, de l'albumine et des phosphates, et la somme de ces substances est trois fois plus considérable que le lait de la vache. C'est une vraie crème. Proverbes. Trois "beaucoup" et trois "peu" sont précieux à l'homme; beaucoup parler et peu savoir; beaucoup dépenser et peu avoir; beaucoup se croire et pen valoir. La patience est la clef de toutes les portes, et le remède de tous les maux. On n'est jamais si bien qu'on puisse être mieux, ni si mal qu'on ne puisse être pis. Si tu vas eu voyage, fais une prière; si tu vas sur mer, fais en deux; si tu te maries, fais en trois. Le tabac à Cuba. Le nombre total des cigares fabriqués à Cuba s'élève à 300 millions, dont 40 millions sont consommés dans l'ile, 118 millions exportés aux Etats-Unis, et 142 millions dans les autres pays.

For many years past the press of the South has been urging upon farmers the importance of diversifying their crops, of planting more grain and less cotton, thus killing two birds with one stone-lowering the price of produce and increasing the price of cotton by diminishing the supply. These appeals have gone unheeded, the usual response of the wise farmer being: "What does a newspaper man know about farm it ould seem that sad experience should, ere this long, have taught plant ers at least a modicum of sense, but such has not been the case; at all events not those of Louisiana and Mississippi. The farmers of Georgia, who have been in the land'of their Southern brethren ever since the war, have acted more wisely. The Macon Telegraph has the following paragraph, which goes to prove the fact: The farmers ~re in good condition and well u. with their payments. In fact, they are ahead of last year, and there will be very little paper carried over. There is no doubt that the farm ers are in much better condition than ever before, notwithstanding the low price of cotton. Just as long as they raise corn, and corn also means meat, they can live happily and have plenty.

Washington, Nov. 26.-The annual report of Judge John L. Thomas, Assis tant Attorney General for the Post office Department, treats at some length of the enormous increase for the fiscal year ended June 30 in the number of companies engaged in con ducting lotteries and fraudulent schemes. Against these concerns 223 "fraud" orders were issued by the Postmaster General, prohibiting the delivery of registered packages and the payment of money orders to certain companies and parties named. On this subject Judge Thomas says: "The craze for taking chances in so called bond investment schemes in our country in the past year has equalled, if it has not exceeded, the tulip mania of Holland and the infatuation created by the South Sea bubble of John Law. These so-called bond investment schemes are more dangerous to society than avowed lotteries, because their lottery features are strenuously denied, and they are held out by their promo ters to the public as legitimate business enterprises. "The war on lotteries in the United States has had one marked effect, and that is to drive men to foreign shores and stimulate their establishment in other countries. A very large business is done in our country by lotteries oper ated abroad, chiefly in the countries of continental Europe, Mexico and Central America, by which large sums of money are lost to us without the compensation derived from domestic lotteries of keep ing all the money within our own bor ders. There is at present no adequate remedy against carrying the literature of these concerns in the international mails, nor need we hope for any until other nations take the same view of the subject that we do. The lottery busi ness conducted through express com panies has increased enormously during the year, in the direct ratio of the de crease of that business through the mails."

Itino t alles¢ t lSerl obw, k) WASIINGTON LETTER. From our Regular Correspondent. WASIINGTON, Dec. 3, 1894. No message ever written by President Cleve land was more attentively listened to than that sent in to-day. The general topics treated by the message, including the foreign relations of the government, were all that any Democrat could desire, and the financial recommendations cannot be fully understood until considered in connection with Secretary Carlisle's annual re port, to be sent to Congress to-morrow, which contains the details of the plan for a reform of the currency of the country which the Presi dent so strongly endorses in his message. What will be the result of these financial recommend ations it will be impossible to say until the sen timent of the Democrats has had time to be come apparent. Speaker Crisp looked quite as good-natured when he rapped the House to order as he could possibly have looked had a majority of the House been as fortunate as himself in getting re-elected, and his own re-election to the Speak ership been assured. Indeed. the most notice able feature on the Democratic side of the House, aeide from the entirely too numerous empty chairs, was the prevailing good nature of those who were defeated last month. If the republicans expected to see an array of long faces they were disappointed. There have been a number of informal con ferences of democratic Senators and Represen tatives for the purpose of discusing the proba bility of reaching an agreement on a program for the session, and there is some talk of hold ing a joint caucus and requiring every man who attends to pledge himself to stand by what u "Lcus adopts. If plei scoii(b Celr .i rou a suflicient num her o control both House and Senate that would be an excellent idea, but it is certain tlat there are six or mlore democratic Senators who would not pledge themselves. Treasury otficials take no stock in the stories that Congress will refuse to appropriate the money needed to put the income tax into oper ation, for the very simple reason that there are no more opponents of that lax in either Senate or House than there were when it was incor porated in the tariff bill. That is the common sense view of the matter. It the opponents of the tax 9ould not prevent its being included in the tariff bill, they certainly cannot prevent an appropriation to put it into effect. There is reason, too, for the belief that Senator Hill, who led the tight against the income tax in the Senate, will not only refuse to aid in trying to defeat the appropriation but will himself vote for it, as he is on record as opposing any and all attempts to embarrass officials by withhold ing appropriations asked for, to be used in car rying out existing laws. Representative Cooper, of Fla., thinks the proper way to fill the oflice of postmaster is to have him elected by the voters of his town or township, and lie proposes to push a bill pro viding therefor. lHe is also strongly in favor of the adoption of somle system of currency re form that will give the needted elasticity to our currency, either that proposed by Secretary Carlisle or something else upon which a major ity can get together, and of a bill providing for the building of the Nicaragua cuanal. He says that if he could have his way lie conul make this session of Congress, a hurt as it will be, memorable in the history of the democratic party. It's a pity there are not more democrats of the same mind. The sugar scandal has raised its ugly head again, and the same democratic Senators whose names were most conspiculously smirched dur ing the preparation of the sugar schedule of the tarif bill are again figuring in the rumors in a manner that is decidedly unpleasant to democrats generally, however the trio of Sena tors may look at the matter. Many democrats are in favor of settling this business for good and all by just putting all sugar on the free list.
