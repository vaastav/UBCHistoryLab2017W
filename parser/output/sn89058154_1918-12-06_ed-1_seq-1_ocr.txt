SELMER. McNAlRY COUNTY. TENN.. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 6, Q1S. NUMBER 22 , PI11111111111111DO SAND BOX SHE KEPT THEM ON THE "JOB H VOLUME XVII. 3 a .... ' As Chairman of War Savings in McNairy county, I appeal, to every subscriber to redeem and make good his pledge and promise to the Government. In making this appeal, I can find no stronger reasons for the redemption than the one given in the statement of Vice State Director ! Hardy, of Chattanooga. Read below what fye says and catch the spirit of it all . : " After all, this WAR STAMP PLEDGE is a matter ' ' of honor with TENNESSE EANS. It is a PERSON- ; AL matter; a CONSCIENCE matter between those who ; .. pledge ;.wd their . GOVERNMENT. , When it was -' .made, wi were living through the trying days of the great , ; GERMAN DRIVE, and were all anxious. The civil-, , ized woild had summoned its full strength. AMERICA ' was, pouring a living flood of men into France and up to . V the battle lines. THEY pledged us THEIR LIVES, We pledged them our ALL We pledged them' the . ,: labor of our hands and our money. THEY redeemed their pledges at CHATEAU-THIERRY, at CANTIG N Y. -at ST. MIHIEL, and in the shell-swept forests of ARGONNE. They fcught; they won; they died. They", redeemed their pledges in full, these boys from TENNE SEE. Shall we redeem ours? The answer must soon . m i Ml IS if .n 1 e given these men: tnev .1 the I congratulate the people of this county on the record they have made in responding to the various demands of the Government in these dark and trying hours. Save a few exceptions, the responses have been hearty and substantial, and reflected the patriot ic spirit and splendid devotion of our men and women, boys and girls. The War Savings organization has been and is a most excellent one, and every member has done efficient service. On behalf of our victorious avmies, and for the soldier boys of McNairy county, I make this appeal for the redemption otevery pledge." Let U3 not forget, in the hour of triumph,' our duty. W. Ii. ABERNATHY, Chairman El I m m iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooos Some things we can understand ahd some we cannot. We see why hogs and wheat are so high, bpeaus the world iriuat be fed, but we cannot see why cotton should be going down every day. The people must be clothed as well as fed. Cotton is aslow now as it can be raised. The ac tual crop is short and the demand must be greatyet the price de clines. The wheat and. hog crop is lrge and prices are advancing. It was unfortunate for -the country and particularly for the democratic party that President Wilson has been bo partisian in his selection of leaders in great war measures, and especially in the makeup of his peace commis sion. There is not a man on it of gigantic statesmanship, tie selected Mr. White as an osten sible republican, who has never been known as anything but a soft-shelled, fosilized old embas sador years ago. Criticism for not consulting his own party, as well as the- republican, will, ' now that the war is over, be caustic and severe. v The firsttontingent of soldiers arrived in New York Monday. They will arrive from now on as fast as transportation can be had, but it is thought not under two years will they all be back. : We will keep a force in different por tiors of Russia, Germany, Aus "Jris and Hungary until order is restored and stable governments set up. Otherwise a chaotic con s dition will disturb the peace, of the world. We promised demo ' ratic governments1- and , ,must make goed or admit the autocrat ic ridden people of-Europ are not capable of 'self-government. - The President delivered his message to Congress Monday. It gave the reasons for his going to the peace conference. He said reconst ruction , was as great a question as the organizing of the army. He was not emphatic in .regard to ownership of railroads. His appearance before this joint assembly of Congress was not ac cepted by the .body with 89 much a 0 m a ID i I m i m are on their way home. i 0 0 enthusiasm as of old, according to newspaper reports. It is ap parent that the President will not have the submissive endorsement heretofore accorded, now that the war is over.' , ''"'., I W. S. S. Pledges. : People of McNairy county will be in terested in knowing that we have Bold up to the last day of October within the county through the banks, post i ffices and other selling agencies, ap proximately a total of $165,000 in War Savings stamps. The population of McNairy county has been estima ted at 16,360 and with an allotment of $29 00 for each person, the qaota of McNairy county is approximately $327,6oo. ; ; - : The State Director, by direction and authoiity of Hon. Joseph A. Mc Cord.'governor of the Federal Re serve' Bank for the Sixth district, which has fall authority in" the War Savings campaign, has set apart De cember 11 as final pledge redemption day when War Savers are called opon to go to their regular sales agency where now their pledge cards are on file and there purchase Whatever bal ance of the pledges has not been ta ken up to that time. This county cannot afford to be trailing in this matter. When the campaign ends on the last day of the year we most by all means be able to report to State Director Preston that car pledges have been met in fall and that we have fulfilled our Bigned obligations. It is confidently asserted that if the pledges are thus redeemed this coun ty will have met its full allotment and will have made another record of meeting the war demands of the gov ernment Aside from jealousy of onr record as a county, we are a part of the great Btate of Tennessee. ,JJp to date we lead every southern state in War Savings and bold an honorable place among them all. McNairy county is counted upon to help per fect Tennessee's showing In this re spect in order to maintain her proud position of having not failed in any drive since our country entered the great war for world democracy.

Plan to do nil or the' fall plowing possible this fall, but do not burn the grans before plowing. Your soilf" need the nitrogen and humus. Mulch the garden with leaves if straw is not available. You can afford to pick all of tho cracked cotton bolls Ja'h fall, as' the price will pay yon to do so. If you haven't a good brood sow on the farm it is time that you get one if you want to get what is coming to you there. There is nothing better than a good sow on the farm for profit unless it it is two sows. You will make money by painting the out door buildings, it has always payed and it will do so bo now. Now ia the time to terrace your lands and pull out the stumps. Do this this winter and save time and worry next spring. " y If your land . is wet and will not produce well, it will pay you. to cut some drain ditches aqd put in some tiling.
