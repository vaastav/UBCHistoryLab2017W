The officers and enlisted men of company K, Montana national guard, have received a letter from Governor Stewart complimenting them on their soldierly bearing and their conduct during the time Butte was under mar tial law. The letter follows: "Now that you have returned to your home stations and put off the cares of military duty after the pro tracted service in Silver Bow county, I am impelled by my admiration of your conduct in a trying time to give formal utterance to my appreciation of the spirit that has animated the troops throughout. "It was with no lack of apprecia tion of the extreme seriousness of the situation that I debated the question of sending the national guard into the disturbed zone. But it became appar ent that there could be no resoration of law and order in that community without a resort to the aid of the military arm of the government. The crisis was upon us—a crisis the grav ity of which was realized by all who were at all conversant with conditions in state s metropolis and be- i WE* WISH IHM HARRY M.

"In doing this I was animated only by a desire to restore peace to the people of the city that had been ter rorized by the lawless. The orders for the mobilization of the troops and for their moving to Butte was issued in the firm belief that you would at tain the end desired and that the power of the law to protect the peace able would be vindicated. By your acts since that first day of September you have more than justified that opinion. "It therefore becomes a pleasure and privilege for me to thus publicly extend to the officers and men of the Second infantry my sincerest appre ciation of and heartfelt thanks for your services. When the state called upon you in her hour of stress you responded with a promptness that showed an exemplary devotion to duty —many of you, no doubt, going into service at a personal sacrifice. "Through all the days of your stay in Butte your record was one that the guard may well look back upon with pride. Your loyalty and patriotism were put to the severest test, and it will be said to your lasting glory that men: the and like i you met test only the ter and at the the for it men you acqutted yourselves on all occasions.

"That your response and service won the approbation of all lovers of peace and order in government throughout the state there can be no slightest doubt And my firm convic tion is that the people will not forget your quick action and loyal answer to the call in time of need.

And I wish for you collectively and individually, many years of peace, prosperity and happi ness in measure unstinted. "S. V. STEWART, Governor, Commander in Chief." THE FARMERS' BOOK SHELF With the return of long winter eve nings, the farmer has considerable leisure time which he can use in most profitable way, if he is so in clined. The careful study of books and bulletins adapted to his locality will give the reader a better under standing of his work, and be a means of increasing his earning capacity. Any business man of to-day who ex pects to keep in the front ranks spends considerable time studying the suc cesses of other men in his line of work. Surely it is just as essential that the farmer should do the same. Twenty five years ago book farming was con sidered a joke; to-day farming is con sidered one of the most complex busi nesses, and the man who follows this line of work should realize that to get the most out of it he cannot study it too thoroughly. It is the ambition of every man who farms to increase his yearly income. We cannot hope to do this by the addition of extra acres, but by in creasing the productive capacity of those contained in the farm. To do this a man must plan, keep in touch with his fellow farmers, and learn to take advantage of every opportunity presented. presented. At a small expense any man can secure a few of the most practical books on managing the soil, feeds and feeding, and care and management of the live stock. Again, bulletins are available through many sources, and by careful selection you can secure such as are practical and adapted to your particular locality. This avail able information, with one or two good farm papers, should furnish any man with some helpful advice and in spire him to seek more. There is another side to this ques tion: that is the fact that a few books I on the subject of farming will stimu I late a greater interest among the boys ! and girls on the farm. They soon I realize that there is something worthy of a little thought in connection with farming, and are not liable to be so anxious to get away from the farm.— J. C. Taylor County Agriculturist.
