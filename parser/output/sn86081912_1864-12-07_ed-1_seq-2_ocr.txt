HARVEY SICKLER, Editor. wvmt* wwi i , mm* *' TUNKHANNOCK, PA > Wednesday, Dec 7, 186 4 "What ia the Matter I it* • The pious, sweet- scented, thanksgiving day—observing editor of the Republican, in an article, week before last, exhorted every body to attend to oid Abe's thanksgiving day. Assuming that but few would pay any attention to it he goes on te say : " For Ourselves we intend to obey the call, not knawing at this present writing who is to occupy the pulpit, whether he. has or has not failed to preach in accordance with our zieics. Vould it not be i grand spectacle to see for once the Psalmist's thril ling invocation obeyed. ' Let the peojJe praise tbec 0 Gad, iat all the people praise thee.' " Tliera being but two established churches In our town —the Methodist and Presbyteri an—it had, for many years, been the custom to.have but one regular Thanksgiving ser mon on that day; the Ministers of these two chmches, preaching alternately ; and as a matter of courtesy and good fellowship etch occupying the other's pulpit. In this, the fourth year of the reign of Abraham the lit, "the whirligig of time," brought around Mr. Lane, the i'resbyferiari Minister's turn. ' Mr. Lane was on hand at the appointed time and place ; i e : at the Methodist church; and preached, what he doubtless supposed to be, ■u ipprnpriate Thanksgiving sermon. The pious editor was there too—at least we as- J same that he Was, for (while he has publicly ' declared that he would not obey the laws of, ! hie country,) wo feel certain that he would go through fire and brimstone, to obey the proclamation of old Abe, at whose will he ' hutde a petty office, and besides, he declared ' his iuteution to "obey the call"—whether ! the preacher, who was to officiate, "had or had not failed to preach iu accordance with , Lie views." lie "obeyed the call"—helped as far as such a meek, humble, sanctim nious ! being could, to make up that "grand specta- j ele," and heard the Thanksgiving sermon' preached by Mr. Laue. In his last week's ! Republican , be entirely ignores the Thauks j giving fe mon preached by Mr, Lane or any j body else, on that day ; but notices, in very ! commendatory terms, a political harangue i and tirade of abusive, slanderous, and parti- j tan charges against "the sympathizers with •Mvvry, copperneads &c." This, the piou< j editor, doubtless thinks "was obeying the j Paahnist'a,thrilling invocation 'Let all the pen pie praise, thee O God"and dubs u il ßrow n s combe's Thanksgiving Sermon on Sabbath Evening." He regrets hie want of space to j gtve|to the public "the more prominent points of tberdiscoorse." It is certainly unfortu- j Bate both for the pieos edi tor and the nigger worshipping,preacher that tho columns of! hit paper were so crowded as to preclude the ; (ratification of his wish to do so. It seems 1 too bad that such a pious sermon, should' have to giveaway to .long winded, political articles and love stories , and that too, in a pious paper, with a pious editor! What a pity it is, that while he hss bad columns of j •pace for politics, so much piety and religion should have beecr simmered down into two short paragra phs! We are not the defender or chanyrk n of thi Rev. Mr. Lane. We are not a regular attend Mt at his church ; and we feel almost cer tain that we shall give him occasion - for re gret, if not offense, hy making such free use ofhis name in this article. What we wish to get at, is this : Why did the pious ed itor—who is a regular communicant at Mr. L'a Church— give the go-by—pass over as unworthy of notice— a regular Thanksgiving sermon preached by him. on the dag s< t apart for such services; and notice in terms of such great praise, Brownscombe's impious, abolition harangue, delivered </n Sabbath ev ening, a time when his hearers had a right to expect that be woul/preach of "Christ snd him crucified," and not of the crucifi d Bigger T Mr.L's sermon, probably contained no allusion to "brudder AbrrvV' sable deity. Dot's vhat'sjde matter ! tifiST Congress assembled at Washington ■ Monday last. The President's message was, probably, read yesterday. It is rumor ed that be will take "strong- r grounds" on the nigger question than heretofore. We should like to know what more could be done to aaake that lanimal emit a stronger odor thau now comes up from b in. car The Pamphlet Laws, of the last aessiun of the Legislature, have been received by the Prothonotary.

We have heard f<r several days past fttOft i marvelous stories pfthe pranks of witches, rapper®,spirits, or spooks, around the house ; of a Mr. Asel Smith, iu Eaton Township .this j county. It is asserted these invisible : agents, haw on Vino or two ocensicns cut and haggled a piece of cloth in the loom—cut baits ; of knitting yarn, in shreads, while in the j hands of different persons of the family— bent knitting needies into the shape of ox : bows—untied and disheveled the hair of the women—besmeared them with spittle, and cut such fantast'o tricks, generally, as moke 1 one's hair stand on end to hear of. All the#e strange doings, are said to accompany the person of the Grand daughter of Mr. Smith, a girl of about twelve years of age; • and who is apparently free froin trick or de * ception—being herself greatly frightened and j annoyed at the presence of these troublesome | visitors. Not having seen any of these mys ! teriouß manifestations, wo will not vouch for i the correctness of the rumors. Assuming 1 them to bo true, we would suggest as a prob 1 able explanation, that it is lhegbo6t or spook 1 of the runaway rigger, H->lmes, who, doubt less. feeling aggrieved that the pot-bellied parson, Kenedy, has nnt yet built his monu ment, (but pocketed the fund raissd for that purpose) has concluded to haunt the old fel low. Hut being a rather "igerant Nigger," lias mistaken the house in which he resides. Hence these fancy didoes around the house of Smith. If some of the long haired medi- j 1 utns, o f which the country abounds, would only fell the ghost of the injured nig, of its j mistake, we presume the Smith family would ' be rid of it. The greasy Parson, Jakey, 1 would then come in for his just deserts Let this dark spook be enlightened. The Trials tu Columbia County. For some time past, the trial of a number jof parties, arrested under a charge of resisl : big and obstructing the operations of the draft in Columbia County, has been going on for the alleged oSence before a military com mission. Three of them, John Rantz, Sam uel Kiine, and William Appleinan, have been convicted of a conspiracy to resist the dratt in Columbia county, in this State, and sen tenced as follows; llantz, to imprisonment in Fort Mifflin for two years, and a fine of a thonsand dollars ; Kline fo two years' im prisonment, and Appleinan to a fine of five hundred dollars and one year imprisonment Gen. Couch has confirmed the decision of military court. The counsel for the prisoners entered their protest at an early 6tage of the proceedings against the attempt to try these men by mi!# itary commission, demanding that the matter be referred to the civil authorities. Their proles', being unheeded, they withdrew from the defence, and the result of the trial is as above stated. Although an express provision of the Conscription law it mcumbent upon the military authorities to refer all cas es of violation of that act to the civil courts for trial, this provision was igtu red in the recent asses of this character in Columbia county, Pa. It appears that the Adui'uis. tralion does not even observe the laws of its own making, saying nothing of constitutional laws. The office holders have a great deal to say 1 about ttie Democratic party being " wiped out" in the late elections, and have boasted that there was but a "corporai'# guard"' of the supporters of McOleilan. but the offi. cial returns, when collected, will make a re- 1 cord that will admonish these croakers to i bewate of future elections. We think that ! McCiellan has received a larger vote, by nearly half a million, than any other defeated candidate ; that he had more votes than any successful candidate in former election, with oue exception ; and that, the Democratic vote wa6 larger last month,than that cast by them on any former occasion, in the same States, by man}* thousauds. llow idle then for enemies of the party to croak about the Democratic party being i "Dead and buried"—as if over a million and i a half of Freemen could be annihilated. We never despair of the Republic; the Democratic party will live while there is a vestige of Constitutional liberty, and will struggle, under any an 1 all circumstances, I for the resti ration of the authority of the Constitution over the Union of the Slates.— Such was our batllacry ; for that we shall still labor, let the hopeful day be deferred ev en more than "four years more."— Ex. MAXIMILIAN TO BE RECOGNIZED.— The statement in the Courier des tat Unis, that Maximilian has refused to have anything to do with the S> uthcrn Confederacy, and will recognize it, is insignificant, in connection with the follow ng passages in a letter in the same paper, dated October 24. "I* can assure you that Mr. Dayton has given to M. Drouyan de Lhuys the a e sur. tnce that if Mr. Lincoln is rc-electcd, not only will he not attempt anything against /he new order of things in Mexico, but. fur ther, that ho will officially recognize it as as soon as he is rid of his Congress after the 4th of March. I hove this from a good source, in trusting to which I have never had reason to repent." So we presume the arrangements has been for Maximilian not to intrigue with the Con federates, in which case he wiil be recogniz ed by the Lincoln administration as soon as Congress is got out of the way. MEETING or ELECTORS. —The Electors ol President and Vice President will meet on the first Wednesday (the 7lb) of December, at the Capitals of their respective States, to cast their votes, which are sent to tlie Presi dent of the Senate, (the lion Hannibal Ham lin) aud counted before both Houses of Con gress on the second Wednesday (the Sth) of Febuary 1865.

A WasbiDgfcio (Uopateh states fht taforimfticn ?hiijd ifcderi r©- ceived there that Sherman'* adracee nd ' had captured Mitten, V tdw io Geopjjia.ilx- ty miles southwest of Augusta. This occurr ed on November 29th. Two days previous ly, Sherman sent a force of cavalry io ad i vance of hiiu jxith orders to ! eoast at Port Roytl, the nearest point. The cavalry crossed the Augusta and Savannah ( Railroad, at Waynesboro, thirtY-sia miles j south of Augusta. It is reported tan they ' captured a Confederate passenger'train, "bat ! after remaining at Gaynesboro a very short i time, the Confederates attacked them. ' The cavalry were dispersed and many cap tured. Some, however, succeeded in reach | ing the sea coast, and no doubt communicate ed the intelligtdee, which was brought to to New York by the steamer from Port Royal ' on Saturday, and sent thence to Washington. ' At Port Roj-al, when the steamer left, there ' was great excitement. The publication of 1 the news papers was prohibited in order to ' prevent any news from Sherman being made ' made known. All the troops were collected !in an expedition which was sent oft to soma ' unknown romt, where Sherman would be met. Shejtuan wdl pass far sonfh of Augus ta. When he wa= at Mitten, on November 29th, he was sixty miles southwest of Au gusta ; seventy miles east of Macon ; and about one hundaed miles northwest of Sa vannah and Port Loyal. These two places are but thirty miles from each other, We print this morning a great amount of Southern news, which, however, sheds bul little light upon the situation in Georgia, be yond the intelligence of Sherman's gradual march southeast, toward the coast. It is un certain whether Sherman intends to march to Port or Savannah. The latest in formation we have is a report that on Nov* 30th, Sherman's advance was forty miles from Fort Royal,'but whether maching to ward that place or Savannah, is not sta ed. Admiral Dahlgren and Gen. Foster are at Port Royal, and are said to have open, ed communications with Sherman. They have sent otit expeditions which are co-oper ations with his column. If these reports are true. General Sherman has virtually reached the coast, though, unless he attacks Savan nah, what use it if, except as a means of get ting his iinny away from Atlanta, is difficult to tell. The reports of the recent battle at Frank lin, Tennessee, now state the Federal loss at fifteen bundle 1. The Federal troops have retreated all the way to Nashville and occupy the defenses of the city, forming a line, each end of which rests on the Cumberland river above and below the city. The confederate cavalry have followed the Federal retreat.&are in plaiu view from high buildings in the town. No infantry are seen,however. General Ilood, no doubt, is enaaged in destroying the Nash ville and Chattanooga Railroad. This road is cut and the wires are down, so that no news can be had of his operations. On Saturday an order was iseued to send the rolling stock of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to Louisville, for fear of a raid, but tie order was aftei wards countermanded. The Con federates have already sent a raiding party to Gallatin, on this railroad, twenty milos southeast of Nashville, which captured two hundred head of cattle. From Panama we hare news of a confed erate plot to capture on of the California steamers. The plot was discovered, and the party, seven in number, were, on November 10th, seized on board the steamir Salvador, outside the harbor of Panama. They were pot on board the United States frigate, Lau caster, which returned with the prisoners to Padama. Application was made on the 12'h to the President af Granada, for permission to pass thera over the Isthmus. This was refused, and it was supposed they would be sent across on the responsibility of the Amer lean Consul. Everything is quiet in front of Petersburg. General Lee report# a recent artillery duel between the gunboats on the James, near Dutch Gap, in which no damage was done, however. General Butler has made a new corps in his army under General Wcitid.— It is to be exclusively composed of negroes. General Pope is said to have been already given a command in Grant's army. He is now in Washington. Captain Strumas' new privateer, is now at Maderia. She was the "sea Kmg," but is now called the Shenandoah. She is repre sented aa having an armanent equal to that of the Florida. George D. Prentice, of the Louisville Jour naly was in Richmond on November SO He went there to visit his son, by permission of the authorities on both sidea. M>jor B. W. Brice has been made Paymaster General of the army. DEC. GTH. F There is no longer any doubt that General Sherman's collumn is marching on Savannah. On November 24th, the advance was at Mil - len, one hundred miles northwest of Savan nah. The Confederates were in front of him retarding his march, but not able to check it By November oO'h, Sherman had marched sixty miles and was forty mile 6 northwest of Savannah. The Confederates were still in front of him interfering with his progress.— On December 24, last Friday, his cavalry ad vance was six miles from Savannah. The main body had not yet come up, and the at tack oc Savannah could not have been begun until three or four days afterwards. In all their marches Forrest and Wheeler, with large bodies of cavalry, Irarrasaed the Feder al flanks and rear. Every straggler was picked up and tnany of the foregoing parties were captured, Seven hundred Federal prls oners bed been brought into Augusta alone. Thestrmolestatioiw necessarily retarded Shef man's.march, and he has not beon able to move faster than ten miles a day. At Sa yWrTfaTiTTie Confederates WW preparing i him. For a Week before last Friday great numbers of troops passed south over the ■ rtifroad from Charleston, being seat from j Align its. General Hardee rcabbed Savan nah on November 23, and Gerertl Beauro garden the 27th. By the time Sherman began bis attack, the garrison was very strong. Shermantias inarched all the way on the west side of the Savannah River -This stream is deep and wide, and the tide ebbs and flows. No attempt" to cross over, as if Port Royal wa9 to be the end q/ tiro marcb, is reported. In a short time we 6hould hear dbfinitely from General Sherman Gen. Beatiregard, before leaving for lire Atlanta coast, made a report of the Federal evacuation of Decatur by Thomas upon his retreat to Nashville. Before leaving, the Federal Troops burned their store houses, filled with provisions. Fifteen pontoon boats were captured by the Confedeiatcs. Thcro is no change in the situation at Nashville, Hood and Thomas still confront each other in the outskirts of the city.— Communication with Chattauooga is stil bioken. All is quiet at Petersburg, and we bear nothing ot the Dutch Gap Canal, Thoughts Suggested in Fort Mifflin. 

WHILE CONFINFD AS A CITIZEN PRISONEf, OR THE GOih DAT OF CONFINEMENT. On the morning of the above named day, it was announced at the entrance of our cell that the day of our deliverance was drawing near. With what a thrill of joy it was re ceived ; like a shock of electricity it ran through the crowd. Countenances that looked wan and pale, wiih anguish depicted in every feature, now brightened up, and were cheerful like the storm-tossed mariner, during the long, dreary night, wtaching with anxious eye llie first ray of light that radi ates the oriental sky that he may direct his sterm tossed vessel to a haven of repose. Sd in this dreary cell, during this Jong night of confinement, what earnest longings ! The very depths of our inmost soul would swell up and grasp at the first glimmer or ray of light that afforded the faintest hope of deliv erance. No pen can descrtbj our feelings ; none but those who have been similarly situ ated can appreciate the delightful sensation produced when the welcome news greeted our ears. Loved ones at home, all the ten der associations, all the ties of consanguinity j in fact all that makes life worth living for' and that had so much to do in keeping up my (spirits. loomed up; and, among the oh jects of adoration on earth, is tho polar star of my affections, was the pleasing thought of aga ; n soon seeing my dear, old mother, whose tottering frame and f< eb!e step warn ed me tint her departure wis near at hand. That look of despair, cast upon me, with at the depths of a mother's love, when dragged from her presence by the military, never will be effaced as long as reason assert* her throne , and tho livid imploring lo.k of im r ; companion, as she sprang from her bed, half clad, exclaiming "Oh ! you will not take h'm what has he done 7 " llow vividly all this f has rushed through my miud, while in this 1 dark and lonely cell; and then, again, my innocent children, who were wrapt in the deep slumher o.'earlo twilight. llow inv imagination has pictured their anguish, when they awoke, and,in tbeir childish simplicity would-inquire for papa* Snatched away with out even the privilege ifa parting kiss, now, when the time has.come when it is reported by the officers that I will again soon be re leased and permitted to see and enjoy loved j ones at home, my feelings almost overcome j me. I will think, perhaps, it is only a dream i that the mind as well as the body fro n con- | finement has lost its vitality ; then the words will repeat themselves, not to be misunder j stood : "Men, you are all soon to be released.' \ But how uncertain are a'l human calculations Twc weeks have elapsed, and still here. I have often thought of the words of an an cient writer, and now am convinced of their truthfulness, that "Nations lose more morally in times of war,than materially." The pro fanity and obscenity that have ccmo unde r my observation during my military confine ment, exceed anything I can portray on pa per. Coupled with the above-named vices, there 6eems to bean almost universal prono ness to drunkenness; of course, honorable exceptions, There are tnen whose moral tra ning and character resist the temptation but they are very 6carce. o;.r treatment was inhuman. When first, taken and incarcerated in this cell, not a stool or bench to rest our weary limbs on ; not a cup, or knife, or fork, or plate—and these few indispeusible articles were purchas ed at exhorbitant prices,ed attend with vexa tious delay. Forty-four of U3 in one cell, without even a separate place to attend to the calls of natare, it is no wonder that one of our nu nber was soon laid in his last rest ing place, and ui.iny others prostrated by disease. My dear brother, when I look back over the scene,and knowing niv own sensitive uess, I marvel that my health is as good as it is. Gd be praised for the same, together with the warm sym pathv of kind friends at home, coupled with an inward assurance that 1 have a conscience devoid of offence. Good bye, brother, for the present ; hoping soon to meet you in a more pleasant place than this, I remain your affectionate brother, 

JAMES McIIENKY Furt Mifflin, Pa. Nov 1, 18G4. CLOSING up THE WAR. —Our Republican friends have promised to close up the war by putting an end to the rebellion in a very short time. All Democrats will rejoice at such a re sult. The Administration has it all its own way, ail the men and money it calls for. the same as in the past three years. No Demo crat obstructs or will obstruct its course. Wc shall he glad to hnvc the war ended speedily, for its expenses arc enormous and its destruction of life is great. Let us even hold our belief in obeyance, and await tbe good time ofpeace and the Un ion with the prosperity and glory of the pa at. But we fear it will be too loug co ming.— h rerW[ford Jrgos. Onr PrleewMW* liie limes , we are'luppy to |ec, is print ! ing articles and testimony as to the condition of our prisoner at AoderaonvU{e. Too taocjtj cannot be said on this subject. We have fre- j quently alluded to it, and would have pressed I its consideration upon the public more strong, j | ly but for the conviction that oor advocacy ' did more harm than good*— The Republican press having established as a rule, that to doubt or deny any position of the administra tion was evidence or disloyalty aiitt attorney- 1 ship for rebels, the interest we felt in the, prisoners absolutely injured their condition ; and as we could not lament their fato with— ! out pointing out that the exchange was btop- , , ped by an untenable position of our auihorL ties, we preferred to be silent. { Tni6 in scry is mainly dae to the fact that , ; the abuiinistration has undertaken to compel ! | the C. 3. A. to admit that a slave taken by 1 • our forces, and used by them as a soldier,' j shall not be restored to his original status when rucaptnrod. We confess to the (perhaps) bad fashion of consulting precedents before It ruling an opin ion, and as we found in the decisions ol the Supreme Court of the United States that "an interest acquired in wer by possession is di vested by the loss of possession," we could not tegard the claim of our authorities as sus tainable. Rut the doctrine being accepted by our Republican neighbors, that after the United -Slates had taken a petition they could not without loss of dignity abandon it, we could see no further use in discussion. We con tented ourselves with expressing the wish that the confederate authorities would, in the interest of humanity, yield the point of pride, There is a radical difference between us and the Republicans upon the manner of con ducting this war, which those gentlemen, with their usual urbanity, style disloyalty.— To our view, the army is merely the minis ter of the law, and its function is to over* come opposition, not to propagate ideas. So the function of the administration is to es tablish the authority of the law, and nothing mure. The administration has cfrcson to attack the institution of slavery as "a military ne- ] cessily." We think its action a military , blunder. It was perfectly natural that it | 6hould do so, having been brought iuto pow- ' er for the purpose >f attacking slavery, which I we fh 'Uglit and still think a political blunder, j We now urge upon the Times and Tribune thai course which we urged before, an ex- j change of prisoners man for man, reserving as hostages a sufficient number to ofT-et the ; slave soldiers captured. It is not only bad j faith to our soldiers, but bau calculation, to do otherwise. Whether a foreigner's obliga- ' lion to the service extends beyond the term j for which he is enlisted, niay be well doubted i but between a prison at Andersonyiile, and j service under PAT CCEBLRNK, the ordinary j mind will not be apt to hesitate very long— j DugalJ Dalgetty would not have balanced on j it a moment. In the name of common justice j common sense, and common humanity. let all , Democrats and Republicans alike recognize j no duty more sacred than the restoration of ' our gallant soldiers to liberty and their homes.— World. Hew >1 urat Died. The sentence o' the military commission wa-i read to him with due solemnity. He listened to it as he would have liste ned to the cannon of another battle during his mili tary life, without emotion or bravado. He neither asked for pardon, for delay, nor for appeal. He had advanced, of his own accord, j toward the door, a if to accelerate the catas trophe. The door opened on a narrow es planade lying between the towers of the cas. : lie and the outer walls. Twelve soldiers with loaded muskets, awaited him there.— j The narrow space did not pecmit him to stand at a sufficient distance to deprive his death of apart of its horror. Murat in stepping over the threshold of the chamber found himself face to face with them. He refused to have his eyes bandaged, and look ing at the soldiers with a firm and benevo lent smile, said, "My friends, do not make me suffer, by taking bad aim, The narrow space com|>els you almost to re6t the muzzle of your muskets on my breast; do not trem ble ; do not strike ino in the face ; aim at my heart—here it is." As he spoke he placed his right hand upon his coat, to indicate the position of bis heart. In his left hand he held a small medallion, which contained the one focus of love, the image of his wife and four children, as if he wiehed thus to make to make them witnesses of his deafhlook.lle fixed his eye 6 on this portrait,& received the deathblow in the contemplation of all he loved on earth. Ilis body, pierced at so sh( rt a distancd with twelve balls, fell, with his arms open, and his face towards the earth, as if st ill embracing the kingdom ho once possessed, and which he had come to re-corquer for his tomb. They threw his cloak upon hi- body, which was buried in the Cathedral of Pizzi. The I. ate Popular Vote. The following is a pretty close approxima tion to the popular vole cast at tho la'o Presidential election throughout the United Slates : Lincoln nd Johnson 1,950,000. McCTellan nnd Pendleton 1,700,000. Majority for Lincoln 250,000. The President has hardly five per ant ma jority on the total vote. For every hundred votes for Lincoln in'the loval States, there have been cast ninety live for his Dcmoeiatic competitor, and a large part of this excess was given in New England. In llie Central Western and Border Slates McClellan has some ninety.eigbt votes to Lincoln's one hun ; dred,despite all the great advantages possess !
