Washington, D. C., December 0.? It is i emphatically asserted that Akerman has been atktd to resign, and that ex-Senator Williams, of Oregon, will be appointed Attorney-General. Akerman has but few friends in his own party, and the Radi cals?senators and members? heartily ap i plaud this intention of making a change in the Attorney-Geueral's office, j Mr. Williams is now in Washington. It i? thought not improbable that the nomi nation in place of Akerman will be sent in to-morrow. One reason of the President's determination to make this change in the | Cabinet is because of Akerman's failure to j give I he Radical party any strength in I Georgia, 

GENERAL AMNESTY. It is believed that the general amnesty bill which passed the House in the last ses sion will be taken up in tho Senate and passed before the recess for the holidays. Its friends will labor persistently to effect that result. i This bill excepts about lire hundred per sons, and does not meet the full require ments of amnesty ; so that It is extremely probable that a universal amnesty bill will bo introduced later in the Fession. If it should puss, friends of the President say it will meet with his prompt approval. 

NOMINATIONS. ! The large number of nominations sent bv tho President to the Senate to-day were all made during the recess, and all of them have previously been published. Timon. Uy Associated Trees. AGBICTTLTUBB IN TUB 80CTH. Washington, December 6.? The Com missioner of Agriculture, in his report ac companying the President's message, speaking of the needs of southern agricul ture. says : 14 It uiu4 be conceded that the course of agriculture in the southern States has not been conducted with that care, skill, and r? gurd for ultimate results, which have cha racterized the operations of farmers in oiher States. While their lands are con tinuously devoted to cotton and tobacco until they liavo arrived at a state of ex haustion, those of tho North are continually improving by rotation of crops, which is absolutely essential to tho life of tho soil Itself, and without which farming and planting had better bo abandoned. " These impressions have induced me to turn my attention to those States ; to seek some niode by wbich the influence of this j Department may be directed to benefit them ; to liud out whothor their imple ments, aud especially their seeds, may not be greatly improved, and how, in the dis tribution of seeds and plants, we may best reach those to whom they may be profit ably sent." lie says that the southern States suffer iireatly In their interests tor want of grasses, in the use of which their productions would be greatly iucrcascd by rendering a rota tion of crops necessary. Clover, with its doej) roots, and rye grass? a strong grower will well euduro the hot sun of the South. In referring to the distribution of seeds, the Commissioner says ho Is satisfied that the mode heretofore pursued Is orroueous. The quantity sent is entirely too small for even an experiment. A pint or a quart of wheat, oats, or other cereal, cannot be suc cessfully grown ; nnd such experiments almost uniformly fail because tho quantity i? loo small. It would be far better to put a half or whole bu*liel of seed in the hands of one eouseientious and careful person than to divide the same quantity among ten or twenty. THE 

NATIONAL TOBACCO CONVENTION. Washington, December 6.? Tho Con vention met to-day in the parlors of the Metropolitan Hotel. Only nine States were represented, many members who are ex pected not having vet arrived. Vice-Pre sident Lewis II. Fraysor, of Richmond, Ya., occupied the chair, with John Straiton, of New York, as secretary. A committee of one from each State was ordered to bo appointed to make nomina tions for officer* for the ensuing year. Several communications from absent members were read? all recommending action towards a reduction on the tax on tobacco to a uniform rate of sixteen cents ?per pound. Acting President Loring Palmer, Esq., of New York, read a carefully-prepared address, recommending a united effort to reduce the tux on the homo production, but rccommeuding the continuance of the duty on imported tobacco. On tho motion to adopt the recommenda tions contaiuod in the address a discussion arose, the cigar manufacturing in forest present opposing the continuance of the duty on imported tobacco. Finally a motion was adopted to receive both addresses and onter them on the re corded proceedings for future use. A committee of nine was next appointed to prepare business to present to the Con vention ; after which the Convention ad iourncd. on-dit that Mr. Williams, of Oregon, will succeed Mr. Akerman as Attorney-General. rilESJLDENTIAL
