(i.?Foil owing a Prooident Olovolaud'a nieeoage, preoentid to CanRreeB to-day: Vo the Cuityrat oj the United Hates: You aru confronted at tho threshold oi roue legislative duties, with a condition oi lie national ficaucoo which imperatively loraands immediate and careful consideritlon. Tho amount of money annually iiactod, through the operation of present aws, fromtha industries and necessities )l tho people, largely exceeds the actn lecaoaary to moot the expeufiea of the 3overnment. When wo consider that the iheory of oar institutions guarantees to 3Very citizan the full enjoyment of all tho !rulta of hia industry and enterprise, with jnlyauch deduction as may be hia chare towards tho careful and economical maintenance of the Government -which protects him, it is plain that lUo exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion, and a culpable betrayal of American fairnees and justice. This wrong inflicted npon thcBe who baar tho burden of national taxation, like other wronps, multipliea a brood oi evil consequences. The public treasury, which ehonld only exiat aa a condnitconveying the people's tribute to it* legitimato objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding placo lor money needlessly withdrawn from trade and ttie people's use, thus crippling oar national energier, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, nnd inviting schemes of public plnnd-r. This condition of our treasury is not altogether new, and it has more than once of late been submitted toJbo people's representatives in the Con/reso, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet the nitualion otill continues with aggravated incidents, more than ever preening financial convulsion and wide epread dieaeler. It will not do to neglect tbie Eitnation becauBO i?a dangers aro not now pclbably imminent and apparent. Tlioy exist nono tho lcsn certainly, nnd awaittliounforseen nnd unexpected occasion whon auddonly they will bo precipitated nnon ce. On the 30 h of June, 1885, the excess of revenues over public expenditures after complying with tho annual rpqnirement of the pinking fund act, was S17 8*9,735 S4; during the year ended June 30 1886. sucn excess amounted to $49,405,545 20; and during the year ending Jan? 30,18S7, it reached the Bum of $55,507,84!) 54.

EUrtncod Kates to the Republican Club MocUu*. 2^k\v Yobk, Dec. 0.?The m?nac;eifl of \-n Nfltionnl flnnvention of RentihllcAn fund during tho three yeara above opacified, amounting in the aggregato to $138,058.32094, aud doducted from the surplus as Btated, wore mado by calling m for tho purpose, outetandine 3 per cant bonds of the Govflxnxnent. During the aix months prior to Juno 10,1887, thoBurplus revenuo had grown oo large by repeated nccumulatiouB, and It was feared tho withdrawal of this great earn of money needod by the people, would so affect tho business of the country that the oum of $79,804,100 of auch surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of tho three per cent uonds still outstanding, and which were then payable nt the option of the Government. Tho procariouo condition of lloanclal affairs among the people utill needing rolief, immediately after the 30th day of June, 18S7, the remainder of the three per cent bonda then outstanding, amounting with nrincipal and intore8t to the oum of $18,877,500, were called in and applied to the sinkiog fnnd contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operaticna of the Treasury Department repreaentations of distress in bufiine6s circles not only continued but increased, and absoluto peril seemed at hand. Iu theso circumstances the contri* bution to tho einking fund for tho current fiscal yoar was at onco completed by the expenditure of $27,684,283 06 in the purchase of Government bonds not yet due, bearing four and four and a-half per cont interest, the premium paid thereon averaging about twenty-four per cent for the former and oight per cent for the latter. In addition to this tho interest accruing during tho current year upon the outstanding bondod indebtedness of the Government was to some extonfc anticipated, and banks Delected as depositories of public money were permitted to somewhtt increase their deposits. tub sunrLua (mows. While tho expedients thua omployed to release to tho poople tho money lying idle in theTreaeury, served to avert immediate danger, our surplus rcvemfos have continued to accummulate, tho cxsess for the present year amounting on the first day of December to $55,258,70119 and estimated to reach the Bum of $113 000,000 on tho 30th of June next, at which date it is expected that thin sum, added to prior accummulations, will ewell tho surplus in the Treasury to $140,000,000. Thero scorns to bo no assurance that, with such a withdrawal from tho use ot the peoples circulating medium, our business community may not in the near future be subjected to the same distress which was quiet lately produced from the earna cause. And while tho functions of cur National Treasury should bo few and simple, and while its beat condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with private buslneta interests, yet whon,.by a perversion of its purpose, it Lily holda money ueelesaly subtract' ed from the channels of trade, there seems to bo reason for tho claim that some legitimate means should be devised by tho Government to restore in an euiornt'ijuy, 

KUUUUH V?^OHJ UI cAua>?^ ench money to its place among tho people. JC Btich an emergency arises thero now oxlfltano clear end undoubted 'executive power of relief. Heretofore tho redemption of three per cent bonds, which were payable at tho option of tho Government, hpc cOordod a meano for tho disbariomost of the excess of oar.rovonnee; bat these bonds have all boon retired, and there no bonds outstanding the pay mont ol which wo have tho right to Insist upon. The contribution to the sinking land which furnlehea tho occasion (or expendltnro In the parchue of bonds hss been already made lor the corront y??r, so thit there la no outlet In that direction. A DOUBTFUL rOWKB, In the present stale ol legislation tho ' only pietonso ol any existing exocutlvo power to restore, at this tlrao, any part ol our surplus revenue to tho peoplo by . Its expenditure, consists In the auppoiitlon that tho Srcietary ol thoTrnaiury 1 niUV fllltflr tlin mnrb-nt and nnrnltami t.lia \ bonds of the Government not yot duo nt a rate of premium to bo agroed upon. The only provision of law from which Bach a power could he derived is found in en appropriation hill passed a number of years ago; and it in subject to the bub* plclou that it was Intended aa temporary ( and limited in its application, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and anlhorlty. No condition ought to cxiet 1 which would Justify tho grant of powor to ' a single otliciMl, upon bin judgment of its necenaity, to withhold from or release to , tho buHiuefiB of tho pBople, in an unuBual manner, monoy hold in the Treasury, and thus aflect, at hie will, the financial eitua- ' tiou of the country; and if it is deemed ( wi6e to lodge in the Bfcrotary oftheTreaa- i ury the authority in tho presont juncture ] to purchase bonds, it should be plainly ' vrsted, and provided as far as possible, 1 with each chpcka and limitations as will I ilelino thin ofticial'a right and discretion, i and at tho buiih timo relieve him from 1 undue responsibility. ItDNDS AT A 

PREMIUM. 1 In conoidering tho question of purchaa- j ing bonds as a moans of restoring to circu- { iation the surplus money accumulating in I tho Trosbury, it should bo borne in mind ' that premiums must of courae be paid npon such purchase, that thero may be a 1 largo part of thaae bonds held as invest- 1 meats which cannot be purchased at any price, and that combinations among hold- 1 ers who are willingtosell, may unreasonably enhance tho coat of such bonds totho ' Go eminent. It has b'en suggested that 1 the preoent bonded debt might bo refund- j ed at a lead rate of interest, and the diflerence between the old and new security paid in cash, thua finding uao for the Burplus in tho Treasury. The success of this plan, it is apparent, must dopond upon < the volition of the holders of the present i bonds; and itiBnot entirely certain that the inducement which muBt be oflored them would rosult in more financial benefit to tho Government than tho purchajo of bonds, whilo tho latter propoBi.ion would roduce the principal of the debt by actual payment, iosteal of extending it. Tho propnaition to deposit tho money held by the Government in bank3 throughout tho country for the use of the people is, it ecoms to me, exceedingly objectionabin in principle, as establishing too close a relationship between the operations of the Government Treasury and the business of the country, and too extensive a commingling of their money, thu3 fostering an unnatural relianco in private business upan public funds. If this echemoshould ba adopted it should only bo done as a temporary expedient to meet an ursreat necessity. Legislative and executivo effort should generally be in the opposite direction, and ebould have a tendency to divorce, oa mnch sad as fast aa can nafely bo done, the Treasury Department from private enterprise. 

WARNED AGA1S8T EXTRAVAGANCE. Oi couroe.it id not expected,th at unnecessary aud extravagant appropriations will bo made for tho purpose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess oi revenuo. Such expenditure, beside the demoralization of ail just conception of public duty which it entaiis, stimulates a habit of reddest) improvidence not in the least inconsistent with tho mission of our people or the high and beneficent purposes of our Government. I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, uu well as to the attention of their representatives charged with tho reopouaibijity of legislative relief, tbe gravity of our financial situation. The failure of the Congreca heretofore to provido against the dangers which it was quite evident tho very nature of the difficulty muBt necessarily produce caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension fliuce your last adjournment, which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within executivo control; and.these appear now to be exhauatod. If disaster rrnulfs from tho continued inaction of 1 Congress, tho responsibility must rest vrhere it belongs. Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with dan- . ger which should be fully realized, and though it presents features of wrong to the people as well as peril to tho country, it is but a result gro win? out of a perfectly c palpable and apparent cause, constantly ? reproducing tho same alarming circumstances?a conjssted national treasury and a depleted monotary condition in the ' business of the country. It need hardly t be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy, we can only ba [ caved from a like predicament in the future by the removal of its cane?. ] again1t pbotkction, Oar scheme of taxation, by means of * which thio needless surplus is takon from ? the people and put into the pablic treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and internal revenue taxes levied upon the con- 1 Bumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be conceded that ' none of the things eubjocted to internal revenue taxation are, etrictly speaking, 1 nteesearics; there appears to "be no jast i complaint of this taxation by the con- I earners of theso articles, and there seems i to be nothing bo well ablo to bear the i burden without hardship to any portion r of tho people. i But our present tariff laws, the vicious, < inequitable, and illogical source of un- I necessary tsxation, ought to beat once ] revlBcd and amended. Theso laws, as I their primary and plain effect, raise tho 1 price to consumers of all articles imported < andeubject to duty, by precisely the sum 1 paid for such duties. Thus the amount of 1 the duty measures the tax paid by i those who purchase for uso these imported articles. Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home manufacturers, because tbey render it possible for ] those of our people who are manufae- | turers, to mako those taxed articles and soil them for a price equal to thatdemand- ! od lor tho imported goods that have paid ' customs doty. Bo it happens that while 1 comparatively a (aw uae'the imported ar- . ticley, millions o{ our people, who never \ use and never saw any of the foreign pro- j dactB, parchaae and uss things of the Bame kind made in this conntiy, and pay ; therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the dnty adds to the imported articles. A TAUlFf rniMBB, Thoao who buy imports pay tho dnty chargod thoreon into the public treasury, bat tho great maj jrity of onr cltisens, who bay domestic articles of the same class, pay a sam at leaat approximately equal to this daty to the homo manufacturer. This Telorenco to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but in order that we may bo constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon thoao who coneumo domestic products as well as those who consume. importod articles, and thus Create a tax upon all onr people.
