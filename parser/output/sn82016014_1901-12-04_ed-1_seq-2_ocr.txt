TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL, WEDNESDAY EVENING. DECEMBER 4, 1901.' SPORTINGJiEWS. Huggins Has Arrived From the . British Isles. Whitney's Great Horse Trainer Talks Turf. THERE SIX SEASONS. Tells What Racing Costs Across the Waters. Animals He Has Cared For Won 185,000. New York, Dec 4. John Huggins, who has trained "W. C. Whitney's racers in England this year, is back in New York, accompanied by Mrs. Ilusglns. Contrary to expectation, none of Mr. "Whitney's horses were on this vessel and there is no certainty that they will be brought back thin fall, although there is a report that they may come on the next trip of the Minnehaha, which is due here two weeks hence. Kilmarnock, Elizabeth M. and Elkhorn are the three which are ex pected. John Mackey, who is general manager for the breeder and turfman, J. B. Hug gins, was also a passenger on the same vessel with Mr. Huggins. A number of thoroughbred English stallions and John E. McDonald's well known American horse, Rensselaer, were on the Minne apolis. Muggins has for six consecutive seasons trained in Kngland. having gone over in 189t to handle the late Pierre Lorillard s racers. Iuring the last season Mr. Hug gins has achieved the greatest honor any trainer can aspire to, inasmuch as he trained Voiodyovsky, the Derby winner, for Mr. "Whitney, as well as Watershed, winner of the Cambridgeshire Handicap, and Game Chick, winner of the Den hurst Plate, a great English 2-year-old event. All told Mr. Huggins has trained horses this year which have won more than J1S5.U00. This includes the $20.0X1 French stake, called the Consent Munic ipal, won by Kilmarnock, and first, sec ond and third money in all races. Not in four years has Mr. Huggins visited his native land. He has a cotton plantation in Texas, which he will visit in a few Asked about Mr. Whitney's Intention in respect to racing in England again next vear, Mr. Huggins replied that he was just then in telephonic communication with Mr. Whitney, but that until he saw Mr. Whitney nothing definite could be said. "I sold out everything I had, paid ort my servants and made up my mind that I was done with training in England for the present," said Huggins, "but now I don't know what my future is. Air. Whit ney has a number of leased horses, which he must continue to race. I do no know whether or not Mr. Whitney will send over Goldsmith and Nasturtium, as you say the report is." "Have von any opinion to express as to the suspension of Lester Reiff?" Huggins was asked. . . "All I know is that the stewards acted, on his case. I saw the race which caused the suspension and I saw nothing wrong. What the stewards may know, if any thing, is more than I can say. But Reiff will be here himself in a few days and you can see him about the matter. "Watershed, winner of the Cambridge shire, can defeat Kilmarnock at a mile. Kilmarnock is a. fair sort of a horse, that's all. It is hard to say what the best horse in England is," continued the trainer. "There are about 4,0u0 horses in training at Newmarket and each is taxed 15 per annum. "Racing in England is a far costlier matter than racing in America," he add ed. "You can not send a horse from Newmarket to any part in England with out its costing from J60 to Ji6 each. But of course we have good men to help us. That is, the assistant trainers are good, but the stable lads try our patience.They never want to do a stroke of work more than is absolutely necessary." "How dws the starting machine work in England?" "All right," was the unqualified answer. "The barrier goes up and horses move away and that s all there is to it. This, of course, applies to the 2 and 3-year-olds. Next year it will be used for all ages. As far as I could see there could be no complaint about the starting." - Huggins is one of the two only Ameri cans who have ever trained Derby win ners. The other, Jacob Pincos, is now in England. Dunlop (property of Edward Corrigan), b. h., by Ayrshire out of Fortuna, who cost $50,060 as a yearling, was also on the Minneapolis. He was sold at Newmarket Kmi weeks ago for ilia. BASEBALL MAGNATES. Discuss the Transfar of Milwaukee Team to St, Louis. Chicago, Dec. 4. The principal ques tion under consideration by managers of the American baseball league attend ing the annual meeting at the Grand Pacific hotel Tuesday was the transfer of the Milwaukee team to St. Louis. It was rumored that the Milwaukee mag nates were hard to deal with, and that they had given out an ultimatum that unless satisfactory terms were arranged in two days no transfer would be made. Matt Killilea said regarding the trans fer: "Tfce owners of the Milwaukee club are opposed to the transfer to St. iouis, and the American league cannot make the change without the consent of the owners. The men at St. Louis were all signed by the Milwaukee club. I can't say what the outcome will be, but there will be some decision soon." Owing to the absence of a number of members of the convention a quorum was not secured until late, thereby de laying action. CONNIE MACK'S TEAM. Has Hartzel and Flick Signed For the Outfield.

Trial of Young Moore at Win field Is Now On. Jury Secured Last Evening in District Court. IS ONLY 17 YEARS OLD. Theorj Is a "Hold Up" With Unintentional Murder. Defendant Alone In Court, De spondent and Sorrowful. W infield, Dec. 4. The trial of Clyde Moore, charged with the murder of C. L. Wiltberger, commenced in the dis trict court here Tuesday. Wiltberger was killed on the ISth of last April, while hauling wheat from his farm. About two weeks afterward. Charles Betts, Jr., and Clyde Moore, of Arkan sas City, aged 13 and 17, respectively, were arrested, charged with the murder. The theory was that they attempted a hold-up, and shot Wiltberger uninten tionally. Betts was tried at the July term of court and acquitted, but is now in jail on the charge of perjury as a result of his testimony at that trial. About two months ago, "Shorty" Mc Farland. a suspicious character of Winfield, who had long been suspected of guilty knowledge of the affair, was arrested on the charge of murder and will also have his trial this week. Betts was acquitted last summer, largely through the efforts of W. P. Hackney. Now Hackney is assisting in the prose cution, while G. H. Buckman, who pros ecuted Betts, is conducting Moore's de fense. The entire day was spent in the selection of a Jury, which was secured just before 6 o'clock. The trial will probably last all week. Clyde Moore, the defendant, seemed to be altogether alone in court. No relatives or friends sat with him and he spoke very seldom even to his coun sel. He was rather thinner than when he was arrested and seems to have lost much of the reckless, defiant air which he sometimes assumed. DOLD CAR SHOPS. Will B.e Moved From Kansas City to Wichita.

A new building will have to be erected, and this means an added number of employes. At present the shops are lo cated in Kansas City. The location of the shops here means an expenditure of several thousands of dollars more in addition to the quarter of a million which is now being invest ed in the new plant. It is said to be the intention of the Dolds to make the Wichita house one of the largest in the world. Now that their Buffalo house has been destroyed, all the interests of the company are centered here.

By a vote of 6 to 2 the council, which contains a ma jority of members elected last spring on a "wet" ticket, turned down the peti tion and refused to repeal the ordi nance.

Physicians can now look forward to the coming winter without any fear or anxiety regarding the thousands of weak-lunged and catarrh afflicted pat ients under their care. Facts furnished by the Bureau of Vi tal Statistics in Washington have prov en beyond the least shadow of doubt that consumption is curable, that all re spiratory diseases can be eradicated completely and the' death rate reduced wonderfully by the use of the new rem edy, HyomeL Hyomei is a dry air germicide found in Australia, the first one ever known which can be inhaled in the air we breathe, the only possible method by which the germs of these diseases can be reached. LUCKY MANUFACTURERS. Never before in the whole history of medicine has any remedy manufactured for these diseases received recognition by the United States Health Reports or been successful in reducing the death rate one iota, and it is expected that all physicians from this time on will use this one 'treatment and no other. Of course this means a tremendous demand for the new germicide and a fortune to the manufacturers, a reward which they richly deserve. LACK OF SUPPLY FEARED. Undoubtedly thousands of lives will be saved during the coming winter through the new treatment, but as this germicide is only obtained in Australia and at certain seasons of the year, it is feared the manufacturers have not a sufficient supply on hand to meet the increased demand. All of those who are afflicted wTith coughs, catarrh or consumption should, therefore, obtain an outfit of Hyomei from their druggists at once, or send to The R. T. Booth Co., Ithaca, N. Y., for a free sample of the new remedy. The R. T. Booth Co., Ithaca. IS. Y. FREE OF DUTY. Goods Imported From Philippines Will No Longer Pay Tariff! Washington, Dec. 4. It is stated at the war department that the decisions of the United States supreme court in the insular cases do not call for any change in the existing tariff arrange ments in the Philippines and that it was not even deemed necessary to is sue instructions to the civil governor of the islands on the subject as a con sequence of the decisions. Secretary Root has had several conferences with other officials in regard to the enact ment of legislation necessary to meet existing conditions, but he said today as he had not received an official copy of the court's decision he was unable even to indicate what steps should be taken. The secretary of the treasury has issued to collectors of customs in the United States a telegraphic order directing them to admit free of duty goods imported from the Philippine is lands. Following is the order: "Discontinue requirement entry and collection of duty on merchandise shown by manifest of Vessel to be ship ped from Philippines. Allow free de livery goods in bond. Detain cigars and cigarettes until revenue stamps are affixed under circulars 81 and 85 cur rent year. Refunds will be made by certified statement where protests duly filed." Red Necktie Betrayed Him. Guthrie, O. T., Dec. 4. Elmer Pecore was placed in the federal jail here to day charged with rifling the mail be tween the small towns near the Indian Territory border. The officers suspect ed Pecore and laid a trap for him by placing a red neck tie and a pair of beaded gloves in one of the mail sacks. They apprehended him later wearing these articles at a dance, where he had taken his sweetheart. Pecore is a mix ed breed. Lexington Sale Closes. Lexington, Ky., Dec. 4.

They are known by various names, but are all due to the same cause, acid and other poisons in the blood that irritate and interfere "with the proper action of the skin. To have a smooth, soft skin, free from all eruptions, the blood must be kept pure and healthy. The many preparations of arsenic and potash and the large number of face powders and lotions generally used in this class of diseases cover up for a short time, but cannot remove per manently the ugly blotches and the red, disfiguring pimples. Eternal vigilance is the price of a beautiful complexion when such remedies are relied on. Mr. H. T. Shobe, 1704 Lucas Avenue, St. Louis, Mo., says : " My daughter was afilicted for years with a 'disfiguring eruption on her face, which resisted all treatment. She was taken to two celebrated health springs, but received no bene fit. Many medicines were prescribed, but with out result, until we decided to try S. S. S., and by the time the first bottle was finished the eruption began to disappear. A dozen bottles cured her completely and left her skin perfectly smooth. She is now seventeen years old, and not a sign of the embarrassing disease has ever returned." S. S. S. is a positive, unfailing cure for the worst forms of skin troubles. It is the greatest of all blood purifiers, and the only one guaranteed purely vegetable. ' Bad blood makes bad complexions. purines ana invigo rates the old and makes new, rich blood that nourishes the body and keeps the skin active and healthy and in proper condition to perform its part towards carrying off the impurities from the body.

"The building will be four stories in height and will be devoted exclus ively to Masonic purposes. The temple will be erected without a mortgage on it and provision will be made that at no time can an incumbrance be placed upon it." The report of the ways and means committee has so far been presented to the Chapter and the Commandery and has been unanimously accepted by both. The report will be submitted to the Scottish Rite, Siloam lodge, To peka lodge and Orient lodge for their approval. The report of the committee on ways and means is as follows: To tho Masonic Board of Control: Your committee of twelve, to be known as the committee on ways and means, to prepare a proposition for raising funds for the erection of a Masonic Temple in the city of Topeka, Kan., would respect fully submit the following plan which, in our Judgment, is practicable, and, if adopted and carried into practice, would result in the speedy erection of a Ma sonic Temple which would forever be free and clear of all indebtedness: First We recommend that the sum of $70,000 be raised for the erection of such Masonic Temple. Second In order to raise said sum of $70,000 we recommend that each Masonic body interested in said Temple, Issue bonds in the sum of $100 each, to be known as Masonic Temple bonds. Third Each Masonic body so interested shall issue only such number of said bonds as will be its proportionate part of said $70,000, based upon its present mem bershin. Fourth A brother can hold only one such bond in each of the Masonic bodies in which he is a member in good stand ing, which is entitled to issue such bonds. Fifth The subscription to said bonds may be paid all cash, or quarterly, or in monthly payments of $10 a month, and the payments shall begin March 1, 1902. Sixth When a brother who has sub scribed for a bond shall have paid the sum of $100 in full, he shall be entitled to one such bond, which shall mature upon the death of such brother and the bodv issuing said bond shall then imme diately pay to the family of such deceased member or to such beneficiary as he may in his lifetime in writing direct the sum of $100 without any question whatever. Seventh As soon as a brother shall have paid the sum of $100 in full he shall be entitled to a bond and his name shall be Inscribed upon a roll of honor on a tablet, which shall be erected in the Tem ple and on which, in alphabetical order, shall be inscribed the names of the orig inal purchasers of one or more of the bonds. And so long as he holds said bond he shall be exempt from the regular annual dues in such Masonic body, the annual interest on such bond to be in lieu of all annual dues of said member in such body. Eighth If during the lifetime of a brother holding such bond he shall de sire to dispose of his bond he can do so, but only through the body issuing the same, and when a bond is so transferred the member disposing of it shall be re stored at once to his liability for the pay ment of annual dues in such body. Ninth The number of such bonds appor tioned to each Of the bodies under this plan shall be as follows: To the Scottish Rite, 233 bonds, and no more. To Topeka lodke No. 17, 101 bonds, and no more. To Orient lodge No. 51, 94 bonds, and no "Vo Siloam lodge No. 225, 86 bonds, and nTotITopeka Chapter No. 6, 101 bonds, and no more. To Topeka Commandery No. 5, 86 bonds, and no more. ,, And when members In said bodies shall have subscribed for the number of said bonds so apportioned to said body, no more of said bonds can be allotted to such body and thereafter such bonds can only be obtained in that body when vacancies occur therein, and when any of said bonds have matured, the continuance thereof for the benefit of other members shall be at the pleasure of the body issuing the same, and when so reissued, shall be in the order in which applications shall have heen filed therefor; and said Masonic Temple shall be forever free and clear of all mortgages and other liens. Tenth And we submit herewith a form for subscriptions to said bonds to be used in each of said bodies and we recommend that each of said bodies appoint ten of its members best adapted to that work to secure at once the necessary quota of subscriptions for that body. And from the assurances we have re ceived and the pledges already tendered, we feel warranted in saying that the 700 bonds will be subscribed without any de lay, as soon as authority therefor is given by the respective bodies, and we are as sured that if the contracts could be let and work commenced on the Temple by March 1, 1912, that the building could be completed and ready for occupancy by December 1. 1902. We therefore most urgently recommend that immediate action be taken in the several bodies interested upon this propo sition and as soon as the same is ratified by all the bodies that the taking of said subscriptions be commenced and carried promptly forward to completion to the end that actual work may be commenced upon the Temple by March 1, 1902. All of which is respectfully and frater nally submitted. Dated at Topeka, Kan., Nov. 30, 1901. (Signed.) jg w, poiNDEXTEE, A. K.

' At the next meeting of the Topeka Commercial club the merchants of the city will be asked to endorse a resolu tion favoring the construction and op eration by the national government of a cable extending from California to Hawaii and Manila, Japan and China. John B. Corliss, member of congress from Michigan, has given the question a great deal of study and in address ing the various commercial clubs of the country says that it is "one of the most important projects before our people." "For years the cable interests have been seeking to secuire from the gov ernment a subsidy varying from six to ten millions of dollars as an inducement for the construction of this cable," says Mr. Corliss. "Their measure carrying a subsidy of six millions from the gov ernment was defeated during the last congress by a substitute bill offered by myself, providing for government con struction and operation. "It was conclusively shown that the revenues to be derived from the opera tion of this cable would fully cover the cost of operation at a rate of one eighth less than the amount in tolls heretofore paid by our government for cable messages to Manila, "The cable monopoly, having been de feated in their attempt to secure a suc cessful subsidy, is now seeking to ob tain the right to this utility so as to charge in tolls an amount which would exceed the subsidy originally asked for. "This will become a continuous bur den upon the business interests of our country and will check the wheels of progress In the Pacific. The ownership by our government of this great utility will not in the least trespass upon the vested rights of private interests. "England has expanded her trade and held supremacy of the commerce of the seas through the influence of the own ership, control and operation of cables operated by the government at actual cost. A British cable is now being con structed from Vancouver down through the Pacific to Australia, connecting British colonies, and if the business men of our country are to meet suc cessfully the competition of trade in the Pacific they must have quick communi cation at the least possible expense. "This can be accomplished . only through government construction, own ership and operation on the plan by which we operate our postoffice depart ment, to wit, al actual cost." A MILD THRILL. Effect of the President's Message in Germany. Berlin, Dec. 4. The message of Presi dent Roosev'elt caused a mild thrill In Germany. On the bourse, where It was eagerly awaited, the message was re ceived with uncommon interest and the market was slightly stimulated upon the posting of a bulletin containing President Roosevelt's utterances about trusts. The shares of the steamship companies fell one or two points on ac count of immigrant inspection para graph and the proposed development of the merchant marine service. Sev eral field Journals aver that there is no reason why the United States should encourage ship building. They say that if the United States becomes possessed of a commercial fleet she will have to built it, inasmuch as the attempts to buy German lines of steamers have been defeated. President Roosevelt's words concern ing the restriction of Immigration con tain an unpleasant suggestion in the present time of depression,- when as the Berliner Volks Zeitung says the hard times make an overflow of the laboring population of Europe necessary. The free trade and Liberal newspapers wel come the reciprocity recommendations, but regret that President Roosevelt did not recommend specific tariff reduction. The first impression of the president's message in German official circles Is that the repression of anarchistis by international agreement is much mora likely to be carried through upon the initiative of the United States than by that of any other power. An anti anarchist preposition from Germany along the same lines as that of Presi dent Roosevelt is probably already on its way to the state department at Washington. The "Vossische Zeitung says the presi dent's message indicates that the feet of the United States are well In the im perialistic path and that ventures abroad seem to agree with them. The National Zeitung alludes to the strong and confident tone used by Pres ident Roosevelt and to his large pur poses. Taking the message altogether, it has been favorably received, both popularly and officially. The references it con tains to the late Empress Frederick are especially appreciated.
