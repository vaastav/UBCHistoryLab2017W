By your attainment of the ; rigid economies already inaugurated. I with hoped-fo? extension of these ? economies and Added efficiencies in ad? ministration I believe further roduc ? lions may he enacted and hindering burdens abolished. In these urgent ?conomies we shall ' be immensely assisted by the budget tem, for which you made provision , in tho extraordinary session. The first : budget is before you. Its pr?paration s signal achievement, and the per : fection odf the system, a thing impos e in the few months available for its initial trial, will mark its enact ; ment as the beginning of the greatest reformation in govern me." tul practices ! since the beginning of the Republic. There is pending a grant of author? ity to the administrative branch of the government for the funding end settle? ment of our vast foreign loans grow? ing out of our grunt of war credits. With the hands of the executive branch he'd impotent to deal with these debt.- we are hindering urgent re adjustments among our debtors and ac? complishing nothing for ourselves, i think it is fair for the Congress to assume that the executive branch of the government would adopt no major policy in dealing with these matters which would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans, certainly not without asking Congres? sional approval, but there art? minor problems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguarding of our interests which cannot even be at? tempted without this authorization. It will he helpful to ourselves and it will improve conditions among our debtors if funding and the settlement of de? faulted interest may be negotiated. The previous Congress, deeply con? cerned in behalf of our merchant ma? rine, in 1920 enacted the existing ship? ping law, designed for the upbuilding of the American merchant marine. Among other things provided to en cc-urago our shipping on the world's seas the Executive was directed to give notice of the termination of all existing commercial treaties in order to admit of reduced duties on imports carried in American bottom?. Delay Asked on Action On Commercial Treaties During the life of the act. no Execu? tive has complied with this order of the Congress. When the present Ad? ministration came into responsibility it began an early inquiry into the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones act. Only one conclusion has been possible. Frankly, members of House and Senate, eager as 1 am to join you in the making of an American merchant marine commensurate with our commerce, the denouncement o? our commercial treaties would involve : in ?.. chaos of trade relationships a::d add indescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world. Our power to do so is not. disputed, but power and ships without comity o? relationship will not give us the ex? panded trade which is inseparably Hnked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction o? duty for which the treaty denounce? ment ? were necessary encouraged only the carrying of dutiable imports to oui shores, while the tonnage which un furls the fla;; on the seas is both fre? and dutiable, and the cargoes which make a nation eminent in trade are outgoing rather than incoming. ?t .- not my thought to lay the prob . in detail before you to-dy. It it lesired only to say to you that the ex ? branch of the government, un? influenced by the protest of any nation for none has been made, is well con? vinced that your proposal, highly in? tended and heartily supported here, i: so fraught with d'fficulties and s( n arked by tendencies to discourag? trade expansion that I invite your to! erance of non-complian^c for a verj few weeks until a plan may be pre sented which contemplates no greatc draft upon the public Treasury, an' which, thought yet too crude to offer i to-day, gives such promise of expand ti ?.? our merchant marine that it wil argue its own approval. It is enough to say to-day that wt are so possessed of ships and th' American intention to establish a mer chant marine is so unalterable that i plan of reimbursement, at no othe cost than is contemplated in the exist ing act, will appeal to the pride an< encourage the hope of all the Americai people. Early Completion of Tariff Law Is Urged There is before you the completio: of the enactment of what, has bee: ! termed a "permanent" tariff law, th word "permanent.'' being used to dis tinguish it from the emergency ac which the Congress expedited early i tho extraordinary session end which i the law to-day. I cannot too strongl urge an early completion of this nee essary legislation. It is needed t stabilize our industry at home; it i essential to make i more definite ou trade relations abroad. More, it i \-'.h? to the preservation of many c our own industries, which contribute s notably to the very life blood of on nation. There is now, and there always wi bCj a storm oi conflicting opinion aboi any tariff revision. We cannot go fi wrong when we base our tariffs on tr policy of preserving the productive a> ttvitiea which enhance employment ar add to our national prosperity. Again comes the reminder that v | must not be unmindful of world co ; ditions, that peoples are struggling f< industrial rehabilitation and that v ? cannot dwpll :n industrial and cor ? mercial exclusion and at the san ? time do tho just thing in aiding wor reconstruction and readjustment. We do not seek a selfish aloofne? and we could not profit by it, were possible. We recognize the nccpjsi of buying wherever we sell, and tl permanency of tradf lies in its acc?s able exchanges. In our pursuit of ma ', kets we must give as well as receh i We cannot sell to others who do n produce, nor can we buy unless we pr due? at home. Sensible of every oh gat i on of humanity, commerce ai finance, linked as they are in the pre ent world condition, it is not to argued that we need destroy ourselv to be helpful to others. With all my heart I wish reatoratii to the peoples blighted by the awf World War. but the process of rector tion does not lie in our acceptance like conditions. It, were better to r main on firm ground, strive for amp employment and high standards wage at home and point the way balanced budgets, rigid economies a; resolute, efficient work as the nece sary remedies to cure disaster. He Declares There Is A Madness in Finance Everything relating to trade, amo: ourselves and among nations, has be expanded, excessive, inflated, abnorrm and there is a madness in finan which no American policy al?n* c cure. We are u creditor nation, n by normal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfish? ness to seek to save onraelvcs when tho processes of that salvation are not only denied to othafs but commended to them. We ?<"ek to undermine for others n.> industry by which they sub? sist; we arc obhratrd to permit the undermining of none of our own whie< make for employment and maintained ad Ivitiea. Every contemplation, it little mat? ters in which direction one turns, mag? nifies the difficulty of tariff legislation, but the necessity of the revision is magnified with it. Doubtless we arc justified in seeking a morn flexible pol? icy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will be found to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted to meet unusual and changing conditions, whieh cannot be accurately anticipated. There nre problems incident to unfair practices and to exchanges which madness in money Imvo made almost (insolvable. 1 know of no manner in which to effeci this flexibility other than the extension of tho powers cf the Tariff Commis? sion, so that it, can adapt itself to e scientific and wholly just administra? tion of the law. I am not unmindful of the constitu? tional difficulties. These can be met bs giving authority to the Chief Execu tivc. who could proclaim addition? duties to meet conditions which th< Congress may designate. At this point I must disavow any de sire to enlarge the Executive's power or add to the responsibilities of the of fl.ee. They are already too lar^e. J there were anr other plan I would pre for it. The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily brin?: the Tarif Commission into new and enlarced ac ' ivities, because no Executive could, di? charge such a duty except on the in formation acquired and recommends tions mad? by this commission. But th plan is feasible and the proper l'une tioning of the board would give us better administration of a delined pol icy than ever can be made possible b tariff duties prescribed without flex bility. Tariff Adjustments Necessary for Years There is a manifest difference t opinion about the merits of America valuation. Many nations have adopte delivery valuation as the basis for co lecting duties: that is, they take tr cost of the imports delivered at. tr: port of entry as the basis for levyir duty. It is no radical departure, i view of varying conditions and the di ordered state of money values, to pn vide for American valuation, but the: cannot be ignored the danger df su< a valuation, brought to the level of ot own production costs, making oi tariffs prohibitive. It. might do so many instances where imports ought be encouraged. I believe Congre ought to well consider the desirabili of the only promising alternativ namely, a provision authorizing pr claimed American valuation, under pr scribed conditions, on any giver, list articles imported. In this proposed flexibility, authc iziug increases to meet conditions likely to change, there siiould also provision for docrca?es. A rate m be just to-day and entirely out of pr portion six months from to-day. If o tariffs are to be made equitabio a not necessarily burden our import? a hinder our trade abroad frequent a justment will be necessary for yea to come. Knowing the impossibility modification by act of Congress for a one or a score of lines without invo ing a long array o? schedules. I thi we shall go a long way toward stab: nation if there is recognition oi t Tariff Commission's litness to reco mend urgent changes by proclamati 1 am sure about, public opinion fav ing the early determination of t tariff policy. There have been re suring signs of a business revival fr the deep slump which all the world 1 been experiencing. Our unemployme which gave us deep concern, only a 1 Tveeks ago. has grown encouragin less, and new assurances and renex confidence will attend the Cong? aional declaration that America1; dustry will be he'd secure. Agricalture Needs More Tha-n Tariff Protection Much has been said about the j tective policy for ourselves makinf impossible for our debtors to discha their obligations to us. This is a c tention not now pressing for decis If we must; choose between a peopl? idleness pressing for the payment indebtedness or ? people resuming normal waj 3 of employment and c;>. ing the credit let us choose the lat Sometimes we appraise largest human ill most vivid in our minds. have been giving, and are giving t o<* onr influence and appeals to mit ;ze the likelihood of war and throw the crushing burdens of armament. is all very earnest, with a nati soul impelling. But. a people ut: ployed and gaunt with hunger fai situation quite as disheartening as and our greater obligation to-da; to do the government's part. to\ resuming productivity and promo fortunate and remunerative emr ment. Something more than tariff pr? tion is required by American a^r turc. To the farmer has come earlier and the heavier burdens oi adjustment. There is actual dej sion in our agricultural indu-'ry, v :;griculfural prosnerity is absoli essential to tne general prosperit the country. Congr^-s has sought very *>rn< to provide relief. It has pron given such temporary relief as been possible, but the call is insi: for the permanent solution. It i evitable that large crops lower prices and short crops advance t Xo legislation can cure that ft mental law. But there mu3t be economic solution for the exce variation in returns for agricultural production. It is rather shocking to be told, and ' to have the statement strongly ?up- i ported, that 9,000,000 bales of cotton raised on American plantations in a given year will actualTy be worth more to the producers than 111,000,000 bale? would have been, Equally shocking is the statement that 700,000,000 bushels of wheat raised by American farmers would bring them moro money than a billion bushels. Yet these arc not ex? aggerated statements. In a *orld where there are tens of millions who need food und clothing which they cannot, get (?uch a condition is mire to indict the social system which makes it possible. Favors Encouragement of Co-op*ra1ive Marketing In the main the remedy lies in dis? tribution and marketing. Every proper encouragement should be given to the co-operative marketing programs. These have proven very helpful to the co? operating communities in Europe. In Russia the co-operative community has become the recognised bulwark of law and order and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis. Ultimately they will be accredited with tho salvation of the Russian *tate. There i'; the appeal for this experi? ment. Why not try it? No one chal? lenges the right of the farmer to a largor share of the consumer:'' pay for his product; no one can' dispute that wc cannot, live without the farmer. He is justified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fair re? turn for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid; and given assurances that hi3 labors shall not bo in vain, we reassure all the people of ;>. production sufficient to meet our national requirement and guard against disaster. The base of the pyramid of civiliza? tion which rests upon the soil is shrinking through the drift of popula? tion from farm to city. For a generation we have been expressing mors or less : concern about this tendency. Eccno [ mists have warned and statesmen have deplored. Wc thought for a time that modern conveniences and the more in? timate contact would halt the move? ment, but it ha3 gone steadily on. Per haps only grim necessity will correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy. The existing scheme of adjusting freight rates has been favoring the basing point3, until industries are at? tracted to some centers and repelled from others. A great volume of un? economic and wasteful transportation has attended, and the cost increased accordingly. The grain milling ami meat packing industries afford amp!-? illustration, and the attending concen? tration is readily apparent. The menaces in concentration are not limited to the retarding influences ir agriculture. Manifestly tho conditiont and terms of railway transportation ought not to be permitted to incrcas? this undesirable tendency. We have a just, pride in our greai cities, but we shall find a greater pride in the nation, which has a larger dis? tribution of its population into th? country, where comparatively self sufficient, smaller communities maj blehd agricultural and manufacturai! interests in harmonious helpfulnes: ur.d enhanced good fortune. Such ? movement contemplates no destractior of things wrought, of investment1 made or wealth involved. It onl? looks to a general policy of transput* tation, of distributed industry and o highway construction to encourage th? spread of our population and reaton the proper balance between city am country. The problem may well havi your earnest attention. It has been perhaps the proudes claim of our American civilization tha in dealir-r with human relationship* i has constantly moved toward such jur tice in distributing? the product, of hu man energy that, it has improved con tinuously the economic status of th mass of the people. Ours has been highly productive Bocia] organizatior On "?:?' way up from the elementa :air^: of society we have eliminate slavery and serfdom, and are now fa on the way to the elimination of po\ erty. ; (redares That Capitalist Often Is a Laborer Through/the eradication of ...:ic;'ac and the diffusion of education nankin has reached a stage where we ma fairly say that in the United State equality of opportunity has been a! tained, though all are not prepared t ambrar" it. There is, indeed, a to great divergence between the economi conditions of the most and the leu; favored clas-1;:, in th? community. Bi even that divergence has now come '. the point where we bracket the ver poor r.r.d the very rich together as th least fortunate classes. Our effort may well be directed to improving th status of both. While this set o;:' problems is con rnonly comprehended under the genen phra?e "capital and labor," it is real1 vastly broader. It is a question < social and economic organization. Li bor has become a large contribu?' t through its pavings to the stock < : capita!, while the people who own tl largest individual aggregates of cap \ tal are themselves often hard ar carnes'-, laborers. Very often it. is c tremely difficult to draw the line i demarcation between the two group i to determine whether a particular ind vidual is entitled to be set down i laborer or as capitalist. In ?. vei ?arge proportion of cases he is bot. and when he is both he is the mo useful citizen. The right of labor to organise is ju i as fundamental and necessary as is t! right of capital to organize. The rig of labor to negotiate, to deal with ai solve its particular problems in an o ; ganized way, through its chos' j agents, is just as essential as is t right of capital to organize, to mai tain corporations, to limit the liabi ties of stockholders. Indeed, we ha come to recognize that the limited li J of the (genuine

Along this line of reasoning we i shall make the greatest progresa to-1 ward solution of our problem of ci?pi-i tal and labor. Fairne?H Is Seen in Regulation of l"nions In the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limited liability of stockholders, particularly when en gaged in the public service, it is recog? nized that the outside public has a large concern which must be protect? ed; and so wo provide regulations, re? strictions and in some cases detailed lupervislon. Likewise, ?n the case of labor organizations we might well ap? ply similar and equally well defined principles of regulation and super i sion in order to conserve the public's interests as affected by their opera? tions. Just as it is not desirable that ? corporation shall be allowed to impose undue o>;actions upon the public, :;o it is not desirable that n labor organiza? tion shall be permitted to exact unfair terms nf employment or subject th' public to actual distresses in order t.c enforce ?ts terms. Finally, just as wc are earnestly seeking for procedure whereby to adju.it and settle pol?tica difference1, between nations without re sort to war, so we may well look aboui tor means to settle the differences be? tween organised capital and organize* labor without resort to those forms o warfare which we recognize under thi names of atrikes, lock-outs, boycott: and the like. As wc have great bodies of law care fully regulating the organization anr operations of industrial and financia corporations, a., we have treaties am compacts among nations which look t< the settlement of differences withou the necessity of conflict in arms, 30 Wi might well have plans of conference, o common counsel, of mediation, arbitra tion and judicial determination in con fcroversies between labor and capital To accomplish this would involve t.h necessity to develop a thoroughgoin, code of practice in dealing with puc affairs. It might be well to frankly set fort the superior interest of the communit ai a whole to either the labor group 0 the capital group. With rights, privi leges or immunities and modes of 01 ganization thus carefully defined, : should be possible to set up judicial c quasi-judicial tribunals for the consh eration and determination of all ciii p?tes which menace the public welfari Homes for Returned Soldiers Are Discussed In an industrial society such as oui the strike, the lock-out and the boyco are as much out of place and as diaa trous in their results as is war < armed revolution in the domain of pol ties. The same disposition to reasoi ableness, to conciliation, to r?cognitif o? the other side's point of view, tl same, provision of fair and reeogniz< tribunals and processes, ought to ma! it possible to solve the one set of que tions as easily as the other. I belie the solution is possible. The consideration of such a poli would necessitate the exercise of ca and deliberation in the construction a code and a charter of element lights dealing with the relations employer and employee. This found tion in the law dealing with the mc ern conditions of r.ocial and econon life would hasten the building of t temple of peace in industry which rejoicing nation would acclaim. After each war until the lad the g( ?rnment has been enabled to gi homes to its returned soldiers and large part of our settlement and < velopment has attended this genere provision of ?and for the nation's < fenders. There is yet unreserved approxima ly 200,000,000 acres in the public < main, 20,000,000 acres of which ; known to be .susceptible of reclamati and made fit for homes by provisi for irrigation. 1".,'; government has been assisting the development of its remaining iat until th? estimated increase in la ?-alues in the irrigated sections is fu ?300,000,000. and the crops of V, ?lone on these lands are estimated exceed 1100,000,000. M2.0O0.0CO.0O0 F ros perl In Public Land Royalties Under what is known as che coa: ; gas lease law, applicable also to posits of phosphates and other n erais on the public domain, leases now being made on the royalty bi and aro producing largo revenue ? the government. Under this legi rion 10 per centum of all royalties ii be paid directly to the Federal Tr< ury, and of the remainder 50 centum is to be used for reclama' of arid lands by irrigation and 40 centum is to be paid to the state; which the operations are loeated. be used by them for school and r purposes. Th?se resource* are so vaut and [development is affording so reliab basis' of reti??ate thatjhe Interior partment. expresses the belief that 1 mately the present law will adn rovalti"? and payments to the tr ur?es of the Federal government the states containing; these pi land-, a total of $12,000,000,000. ' means, of course, an added wcaltl many times that sum. These prosp seem to afford every justiricatioi government advances in reclama and irrigation. Contemplating the inevitable and rirable increase of population there isj another phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration. There arej 70,000,000 nrres of swamp and cutover lands which may be reclaimed and l made as valuable us any farm lands ? wo possess. These acres are largely1 located in Southern states and the greater portion is owned by the states or by private citizens. Congress ha*5 j a report of the survey of this field j for reclamation and the feasibility is ; established. I gladly commend Fed? eral aid. by way of advances, where \ state and private participation is i assured. Home-making is one of the greater benefits which government, can bestow.' Measures are pending embodying this sound policy to which we may well adhere. It. is easily possible to make ' available permanent homes which will ; provide in turn for prosperous Ameri? can families without injurious compe? tition with established activities or im? position on wealth already acquired. While we are'thinking of promoting the fortunes of our own people I am sure there is room in the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human beings who are suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. A severe drought in the valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into grievous famine. Our voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save the lives of children in this area, but it is row evident that unless relief is af? forded the loss of life will extend into many millions. America cannot be deaf to such a call as that. We don't recognize the govern- j men!, of Russia, nor tolerate the propa- I ganda which, emanates therefrom, but, we do not forget the traditions of! Russian friendship. We may putaside| our consideration of all international J politics and fundamental differences in government. The big thing is the cali of the suffering and the dying. Un reservedly I recommend the appropria-.' tion necessary* to supply the American . Relief Administration with 10,000,000) bushels of corn and 1.000,000 bushel ?' , of seed grains, not alone to liait the ; wave of death through -tarvation, but ? to 'liable spring planting in areas, where the seed grains have been ex hausted temporarily to stem starva tion. The American Relief Administration is directed in Russia by former officers of our own armies, and lias fully dem? onstrated its ability to transport and : distribut?) relief through American ! hands without hindrance or los-. The time has come to add the government's ! support to the wonderful relief already wrought out of the generosity of the American private purse. I am not unaware that we have suf? fering and privation at home. When it exceeds the capacity for the relie** i within the states concerned it will have Federal consideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to our j own heart promptings, and out of ac- j cord with the spirit which acclaims the Christmastide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten this burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in fam? ine's peril. There are a full score of topics con? cerning which it would be becoming to address you and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I have alluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I cannot end tills limited address without a suggested amendment to the organic law. Would End Isso? of Non-Taxable Bonds Many of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant about, alter? ing the fundamental law.
