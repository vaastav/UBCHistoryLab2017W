Chicago, Nov. 28 —Preliminary steps were taken to-day for the foimatiou of a land league, its purpose being to assist lu the de tenceof] arnell ami his conferrees in Ireland and to encourage the land agitation of that country. A committee of nine Irishmen and Americans was appointed to report next Sun day on organization. The plan is to have clubs formed in each ward of the city, all to be tributaiy to one ceutral body, and through these branches to raise money to be forward ed at once to Ireland. Considerable zeal was manifested, and something substantial will doubtless result. The Silver Dollar. New York, Nov. 29. —The Tribune says: A Washington dispatch announces that Sec retary Sherman will propose a common sense way out of tlie silver dollar dilemma. He will ask that the coinage of the present silver dollar be suspended and Llie huge accumula tion iu the treasury vaults be recoined into dollars containing sufficient silver to make them equal in value to gold dollars and keep the two coins in circulation together. The secretary will show that this can be done practically without expense to the govern ment. The president will support this senei ble suggestion in his message. Tally One For llcecktr. Nuw York, Nov. 28.—Gen. Grant and ex-Minister Romero of Mexico, attended ser vice to-day in Beecher's church, Brooklyn. The congregation became aw are of the presence of tlie distinguished gentlemen and remained in their seats after tlie benedict ion and doxology. Mr. Beecher informed tlie people that the services were ended and asked that they leave the chui eli. There was, as yet, no manifes tation or disposition on the part of tlie con gregation to leave before Grant ami Romero. Mr. Beeclier then said : " This house is for tlie worship of (Sod, not of man," and ap pealed to tlie assembly to disperse. Seats being still retained, Grant and Romero left quickly, followed by tlie whole congregation. Niliinuon of tlie Siinili. Chicago, Shy. 29.—Tlie Tribune lias a Washington special giving a hopeful view of the southern political situation, from Judge Lochrane, ot Georgia, who thinks the south lias chiefiy friemlly words for Garfield, and is disposed to be reasonable in all matters henceforth under discussion. The south, he says, made no claim to recognition iu the cabinet, and is steadily growing local in sen timent ami getting more to love the constitu tion and the goverment. Tlie southern peo ple are fond of their memories, of their his tory and of tlie name of their section. But they daily see more of the logic of events, that loyalty means prosperity and sectional ism means ruin. They grow wise, and tlie day is not far distant when the solid south will be disbanded and the loyalty of the soutli will be as warm as that, of New En gland. To accomplish this Garfield will not nuke tlie mistakes of his predecessors in ac cepting less services for honest patriotism. The states rights question is settled. Tlie ma c ses ot tlie people of Georgia are in accord with the principles of the republican party with respect to tlie tariff and internal im provement. In contradistinction to this roseate picture, RogerG. Mills, of Texas, says: Tlie democracy failed on account of failing to meet and combat tlie protective tari IT issue and all protection monopolies. The tight on the tariff question lias only jus', begun, and the south will remain solid. Troubled Ireland. Dublin', Nov. 29.—Tlie resolution of tlie cabinet not to resort to Coercion, caused very great disappointment and apprehension among all classes in the disturbed districis. They look with alarm at the ptaspects of more outrages and wider spread intimidation and disaffection There is good reason to be lteve that the executive will show by great activity and energy that they possess suffici ent power in the ordinary law. i he disturb ed districts are Hooded with constabulary and meetings am! all the resources at the command of the authorities available are required for the protection of life and property. But se cret and complete organization of the land leaguers enable them to anticipate the move ments of the constabulary and in some in stances defeat them. There can be no doubt that tlie organiza tion of the land leaguers is rendered most perfect and formidable by the connection with the fenian system. It is this that makes intimidation so irregular. In some districts it is practiced witli great subtility and skill so that the authorities are unable to counter act it. They can deal only with open acts of violence which are avoided as much as possi ble, while a more effectual, system of terror ism is carried on under an external appear ance of tranquility. The Riot Rear Leadville. New Toiik, Nov. 28.—There seems ts be tonic mystery about tlie shooting of Lieut. Gov. Robinson, at Robinson's Camp, last night. Tlie particulars so far as heard an : There was a dispute about tlie possession of the mine, and a guard had been placed to watch it. Last night Gov. Robinson and the manager ef the mine went to it after da<k. Tlie guard, not recognizing them ar.d not hearing an answer to his inquiry as to who tliev were, fired, lie says, into tlie rocks over head. Gov. Rohinsoii fell, shot in four places. He is still living, but his wounds are believed fatal. The fact that there has been trouble between tlie miners and managers during the past week gives a suspicions aspect to tlie case. DXMVKK. Nov. 29.—Gov. Robinson died this morning at 7 o'clock. Whether his death was caused by accident or murder is not fully settled, but a post mortem examinat ion to-day will probably throw some light on tlie sub ject. Washington Uossip. Washington, Nov. 27.—Early next week a proclamation will be issued by the president plactug G Inna on tlie same footing as Great Britain and other nations in the matter of port and tounage dues iu this country. The proclamation w ill in siiort declare "that Chi nese vessels are not subject to any discrimiu ating duties." The official announcement will probably be issued as soon as Monday or luesday. Additional information received here by telegraph from China makes it cer tain that tlie new treaty on the subject of im migration will be entirely satisfactory to the I acme colist sentiment. As stated in a spe cial dispatch to tlie California Associated i ress, last Monday, it does not attempt to reg ulate the subject minutely by treaty stipula tions, but broadly clears the way for congres sional action to restrict the immigration of Chinese laborers to any extent that the Unit ed KLales may deem advisable. Justice Strong will retire from the bench before Jan. 1, and Justice Swayne intends to retire as soon as Strong's successor shall be confirmed by the senate. They are boll, elig ible for retirement on full pay, each being oyer 70 years of age and bave served 10 years. Ilwy cannot both leave tlie bench at the same time without breaking the constitutional quo rum for the supreme court,which is six of the total nine, because Justices Clifford and Hunt are eacli physically if not mentally unable to perform any judicial labor. Although per manently disabled, neither Clifford nor Hunt will yet resign, tlie first having long ago de clared that lie would not resign unless he could be succeeded by a democrat, and Hunt being not yet eligible to retirement with pay. If they don't resign, or if Justice Hunt is not provided for by special act of congress, there is considerable probability that a law will be passed providing for the appointment of two additional members of the supreme court, whose places shall not be filled until the total number tie again reduced to nine. This would give the court its full complement of membership both before and alter tlie deatli or retirement of Clifford and Hunt. It is practically certain that ex-Senator Stanley Matthews will succeed Justice Swayne, and it is for this reason that he lias withdrawn from the contest for the Ohio scuatorship. Washington, Nov. 29th.— General and Mrs. Garfield left to-day for home. The treasury department to-day issued $506,00" silver certificates on deposits of gold made in New York. $500,000 were issued on similar deposits on last Saturday. General Walker, superintendent of the census, characterizes as entirely erroneous the recently published statement that the money for taking tlie census of the Indians had given out, and that the work was a fail ure. lie says that one-tliird of the money set apart for this service has been expended, though it is yet ioo early to determine the exact degree of success which will he attained in certain directions. Efforts have been made for tlie first time to obtain important information respecting Indian treaties and bands, and be has no reason to doubt that much in the way of valuable results nl;ty be obtained, and is sure uo one has yet a right to declare the work a failure in any paiticular.i A telegram from Berlin informs tlie war department that tlie cases of America's nat uralized citizens who were arrested in Alsace and Loraine on charges of owing military service, have been decided in accordance with the claims of this government. Tlie re lease of Weil has been already reported, and it is now announced that, in his case as well as in the previous one ofGetnes, that all fines and penalties imposed by tlie German gov ernment will be remitted. General Miles lias arrived in tlie city, and it is generally believed that his appointment as Cliief Signal officer ot the army, with tlie rank of Brigadier General, will be announced to-morrow. Tlie President, General Sherman, Secre tary Ramsey, Postmaster-General Maynard, Third Assistant Postmaster-General Hazen, and Mr. R. II. Hager left here this evening for Easton, l'a., for the re-dedication of Par dee Hall. Washington, Nov. 30.—A fire broke out. last night in the barber shop of tlie house ol' representatives, and before it could be ex tinguished considerable injury was done the walls. Origin unknown. Gen. Walker, superintendent of the cen sus, lias submitted his regular annual report to tlie secretary of tlie b terior. He says that although the taking of tlie tenth census is substantially complete, returns having been received from all but seven of tlie 31,265 enumeration districts, it will probably bo two or three weeks before lie will be able to present tlie complete statistics ot the popula tion of the country, and iie therefore consid ers it. advisable to postpone to a future report all mention of the result of the emuBeratient and also all discussion of the methods in use, as well as any suggestions which may require to he made of changes in tlie census law with reference to future enumerations. The superintendent says every year and eyery month which can be saved in th4 com pilation and publication ot any statistics adds greatly to their value. Ha recommends that congress be asked to authorize the printing, by special contract, under tlie supervision ot the secretary of the interior and. if it be thought desirable, also of tlie printing com mittees of tlie two houses of congress, of sev eral reports of the census as fast as prepared. The accounts of 28,410 enumerators have already been settled, involving a total ex penditure of upwards of $1,820,000. Only about 1,200 accounts remain unadjusted, and there is no reason to doubt that a month more enumerators paid lor their : see all tlie ------- . . services except only in cases where there is tor reasons unmistakably con suspension tor reasons nected witli some fault of tlie enumerator. Proymslus Finely. Chicago, Nov. 30.— The Inter Ocean's Washington special says: John I. Davenport and Marshall Jewell are still here, and say the work of ferreting out tlie testimony ot the Morey letter is progressing finely. The author will, Davenport says, surely be discov ered, probably in a very siiort time, and the discovery and" exposure wit! have great etlect i„ tlie campaign of 1884. They say that ex cept for that letter neither New Jersey, l alt fornia or Nevada would have gone democratic, and this fact will damage ti.e democrats ter ribly when it is once fairiy established that tlie democratic leaders were tlie liisp.reis o , i ihe Romk. Nov. 30.—It K u ." 1 l'ope is prep hostule atti France and other an allocution co the church « ouiiiuiliy (': hostule attitude to the chureh on the Military Matters* Chicago, Nov. 29__ The Inter Ocean Washington special says: (lea- Miles ar rived to-day and squabbles over signal service appointments have broken out afresh. It is understood that both Hayes and Garfield favor Hazen and it is now believed that he will be appointed. Ord will be retired and Miles be given hl» place. But it is understood Ord objects to retirement unless McDowell is also retired. Ord is nevertheless past tbe retiring age and his disinclination is considered un gracious. It is understood that Schofield will, by permission, lake a year's absence. This will simplify matters. For, as he leaves West Point, there will be no place for him, unless a new department be created. The Drciassy Case, Paris, Nov. 30.—The socialist paper pro poses a subscription to cover tlie fines in tlie Decissey case, while Gen. Decissey intends to give the damages awarded him tothe military fund. Tjie leniency of tlie sentence is due Lo two reasons: Firstly, the judges thought a parliamentary investigation might reveal something, and they could not, therefore, im pose a penalty like imprisonment. Secondly, imprisonment of the defendant might have led to demonstrations in tlie streets and by the clubs. The judgment, however, perfectly rehabilitates Gen. Decissey, but the officers of the army seem much irritated at the judg ment, of which they can not exactly compre hend the motives. nillliiry Malters. Washington, Nov. 29.—It is again re ported, on what seems to be good authority, that a number jof important army changes will take place soon after the reassembling of congress. Maj. Gen. McDowell, Gen. Ord, Inspector Gen. Marcy, Surg. Gen. Barnes and Q. M. Gen. Meigs, all of whom are eligi ble to retirement, will, it is believed, retire from active service. There are many com petitors already in the field anxious to fill the prospective vacancies. Brig. Gen. Howard is said to have been ordered here with a view to promoting him to a major-generalship as McDowell's successor. Gen. Miles, if not appointed chief signal officer, will have good prospects of succeeding Ord as a brigadier general. Gen. Hazen's friends are urging him for chief signal officer, but are ready to fall back oil Ord's position, or, as still another alternative, some of them are suggesting Jfiis appointment as quartermaster general. Gers. Rucker and Ingalls are both in pursuit of Meigs' placejfrith the chances in favor of the former. * Taellead Authoress. London, Nov. 29.—The remains of Estelle Anna Lewis, the authoress, were deposited in the catacombs in Kensal Green cemetery, yes terday, preparatory to removal to New York, according to the directions of tlie will of tbe deceased. W. J. Hoppin, secretary of the American legation attended the funeral as the représentâtlvô*rf_ Minister Lowell. Ingram, tlie biographer of Edgar A. I'oe, and other members of tlie literary world were present. The officiating clergyman expressed the hope that tlie respect stiowu for tlie deceased au thoress by lier English friends would be re ceived in tlie United Slates as an additional token of good will. (»Otbaill Cr<KMl{l. New York, Nov. 30. —Opinion seems to be divided as to what progress has been made in Hayes' annual message. Some correspond ents say the message is entirely completed and ready for tlie printers, while others say some subjects are not yet touched, tlie presi dent having to wail far the reports of his sub ordinates. The great scheme to convert Madison Square garden into a theatre, museum, lec ture room, etc., lias been abandoned because of the difficulty in obtaining subscriptions. Barnunt, who was at tlie bead of tbe enter prise, is still quite ill. Vftval A attira. Washington, Nov. 29.—A hundred thou sand dollars were saved from tlie appropria tion for the construction and repair of the navy. Chief Easbz's report gives the present num ber and class of vessels comprising our navy as follows : In commission, 8 steamers, 29 sailing ships, 4 monitors, 88 torpedo boats, in ordinary there are, steamers, 18 ; sailing vessels, 8; monitors', 7; receiving ship steamers, 8, monitors, 7; 1 sailing ship, 3 mon itors, 1 store ship, 2 steamers and 6 sailing ships. Un the stocks are : steamers, 3 ; sail ing ships, 1 ; monitors, 4 ; ironclads, 3 ; re pairing steamers, 9. At tlie naval aeademv are: sailing ships, 3; monitors, 1. Tugs of all kinds at tlie yards and stations, 25. Total number of vessels, 139. A brief inspection of the foregoing list of vessels will sinnt tbe necessity of an increased number of efficient vessels for tlie navy. Tlie finishing of the five monitors and two cruising ships now commenced, and the improvement and repairs to the Dictator are of tlie utmost importance. I respectfully recommend the building of two armored ships of displacement of 5500 tons each, and of three uiiarinored gunboats hav ing a displacement of 700 tons. The esti mated cost, of these vessels under this bureau is $2.900,000, but an appropriation of only $1,600,000 will be required for the first year. The appropriations asked for by this bureau are for the preservation and repair of vessels. Purchase of materials required in finishing the New York and Mohican and repairing tlie Dictator, $2,500,000 ; for building three gun boats and commencing woik on two armored in cruising ships, $150,000 ; for finishing and re pairing the monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphi ot pa: trite, Monadnock and Miantonoma, $3,122, 830; total appropriation asked for, $7,122,836. Chief Scltock, of the bureau of steam engi neering. reports that tlie total amount appro priated for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 18811, was $800,000; total amount expended, $794,013. Jeffers, chief of tlie ordnance, asks for $ 300,000 for 1881-2 for guns of the latest sys tem. _______ Commercial. Washington, Nov. 30.— The excess of ex ports of merchandise for tlie twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1889, is $155.572,150; for the twelve months endedOct. 31,1879, $269,257, 13Î. Tlie excess of imports of gold and sil ver coin and bullion for the twelve months ended Get. 81, 18S0. $67.214.821; for the twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1879, $43,763, ! 343. The receipts of the patent office f or the i $730,547; total expenses, $53,896, Chinese Bights to be Esspeoted New York, Nov. 30.—The Herald's Den ver special says: Col. Bee, Chinese consul at San Francisco, is now in Denver investigat ing the recent Chinese riot in this place. In reply to questions he etated that he had been ordered by tlie Chinese embassy at Washing ton to make close inquiry into the affair of Oct. 31, and that he had, iu accordance with his instructions, carefully looked into the matter ami will return to 8an Francisco to prepare his report for transmission to the Chinese minister to tlieUnited States. Bee is very reticent as to the result of his labors, but it is understood that lie has taken ste^s to procure estimates from Chinese resi dents here of the amount of damage sustained by them, individually and collectively, and that he has procured the fullest evidence ob tainable concerning the riot, having been per mitted to use tlie evidence brought out iu the coroner's Investigation of the death of l ing Lee, who was killed by the mob. He says lie has no doubt that his government will require the United States to indemnify the Chinese for their losses. There is no state or city statute providing for such indemnification, therefore the Chin ese will look to the general government, which, he says, invited them here, to make good ail losses, and he is of the opinion that our government should be prompt in its ac tion. The Chinese government has set an example which he thinks should be followed, having paid over to the United States without grumbling or loss of time as much as $700, 000, $500,000 of which is now in the treasury at Washington, to indemnify American citi zens for losses sustained during the riots in China. When asked as to whether the government which he represented would take any stçps looking to tlie punishment of those who are responsible for Ling Lee's death, he said it would not, but intimated that lie thought some of the Chinese as individuals would probably employ counsel to assist the state in prosecuting. Bee thinks the census returns will show there ate about 80,000 Chinese in America,of which number the Pacific coast has about 52,000.______ Wliat (onicreni Will Do. Washington, Nov. 30.—Not less than 36 members of congress are in the city, and among this number there is not a single one who advocates an extra session of the 47th congress, or an indulgence in any tactics to bring one abou.t Tlie present outlook is that the coming session will be devoted almost exclusively, besides «ounting the electoral vote, to tlie passage of the regular appropria tions bills, a funding bill, and perhaps an ap portionment bill. It is not believed, despite the forthcoming recommendation of the press and Secretary of the Treasury, that there will bo any legislation to cflect tbe present status of the standard silver dollar, with respect to its weight or the amount of coinage. No amendatory tariff legislation is anticipated, but an undoubted effort will again be made to put salt and paper ptllp on the free list. Tliê whole subject of tariff re vision will most probably be assigned to tlie commissioner, as provided by tbe Eaton bill. The present disposition is to keep politics out of debate as much as possible, and especially in the house ef representatives, and there is a manifest desire to make thu session one of business only. The democrats will undoubt edly be disposed to accommodate them. The republicans urge au extra session to enable their party to secure control of the organization of the house directly after the 4th of March, but are being frowned down by some of the leaders. All that could be gained by such control would be four offices, and the dispo sition of tlie republican leaders is to let tbe democrats bold on to them until December of next year. Uf course there will be a short session of the senate to confirm President Garfield's appointments. How long this will last will depend first on the nature of 'he struggle that may take place over tlie matter of organization, and secondly,that no Chinese treaty may not by that time have been rati fied : if not the senate may remain in session as long as may be necessary in order to dis pose of it, the Chinese question having now reached that degree of national interest that neither party will care to ignore it. There is also reasou-to belive that in tlie event of a speedy ratification of the new treaty next winter some measure similar tothe 15passen ger bill may be promptly enacted to make it effectual before tlie present congress expires on the 4tli of March by limitation. I'raniliAlleml__Reiwivrltable Discovery —Military. Chicago, Nov. 30. —Florida advices say that the republicans will contest botli seats for congressmen from that state, on the ground of gross frauds by the democrats. James Stephenson, in charge of the geologi cal survey of western New Mexico, returned to-day, and claims to have discovered another remarkable prehistoric city. It extends for miles, the houses being built in the face of a cliff'along a canyon. It is distant some 40 miles from Santa Fe. It is understood that the chiefobstacleinthe way of the army retirements favored by President Hayes, is tlie hostility of General Sherman. He does not believe in relieving men who, although old, are doing very well, and who are not so old as statt' officers in Europe. It appears that there are 27 officers equal to or above tlie grade of Lieutenant Colonel, who might be retired under the law as fast as vacancies occur on tlie retired list. This would promote 135 younger officers, who, with their friends, are urging that the law should be enforced. All of the 27 except 8 are staff officers, and of Ihe 8 three are Gen eral officers. It is a source of great concern to the officers whether the President persists in his desire to keep tlie retired last full, or follow General Sherman's policy not to re tire men as long us it can be possibly avoided. The general opinion to-day about head quarters seems to be that a compromise will be effected by retiring about a half dozen, in cluding Ord, Barnes, Meade and Dunn. Barbnrana Outrage. Cork, Nov. 80.—A barbarous outrage was committed near Traleeoff on a bailiff who was in charge of a house from which the ten ants had been evicted. A party of armed meu broke into the house and slit the bailiff's ears, and the bailiff fainted from loss of blood. A police station has been erected at New Pallas without disturbance. Reward Offered. Dublin, Nov. 80.—The Gazette contains an offer of X 1,000 reward for the discovery of th® murders of Wheeler, at 0®la.
