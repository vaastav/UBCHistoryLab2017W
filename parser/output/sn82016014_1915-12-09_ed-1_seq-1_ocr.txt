LAST COLONY British Planning- to Capture German East Africa. The Kaiser Will Then Have o Foreign Holdings. Xew York. Dec. 9. A new cam paign to capture Herman East Africa, Herm-my's last remaining colony, has lt n placed in control of Oenorai Kothi. premier of British South Africa. nd conqueror of Herman Southwest Africa. (Jeneral Botha may nt personally take command of the expedition. Mit he will direct its strategy. The ostensible reason, for the South A fricans ennapinij ly themselves in this difficult undertaking is the dange sir -hisr from the "rming of the nat'.v hy the Hermans and the preaching amiinK the blacks of a holv war against the Christians. This however, 1 not the true reason. The expedition in reality, owes its origin to frequent criticism of the British government within the United Kingdom tor not having persisted in their earlier imperial operations apainst the Germans' Kast African colony. The Hermans have been able to retain their Ka?t coa?t colony be cause of various fiascos that have overtaken British operations in b.th the northern and southern areas. There are scarecely 5,000 Hermans in the entire 384,000 suare miles of the territory. The Teutons, however, have organ ized respectable fighting units of na tive blacks since the outbreak of the war and have 'nflicted defeats on the small British battalions that have tried in haphazard fashion to secure possession of the immense area of the colony.

Herman Consul Bott of this city today predicted a general exodus of Herman-Americans after the European war. Bott charged that both England and Japan violated American neutrality and, in alleging federal officials coun tenanced such violation, cited the fol lowing: Army automobiles bought for Can ada were stored in a Buffalo, N. Y., armory; C. C. Crowley, a detective Bott employed, gave him this informa tion. An American tug left San Francisco early in the war to aid the Japanese cruiser Asama, stranded at Turtle Bay. Japanese cruisers smuggled Japa nese recruits aboard after hunting them up in Fresno and Los Angeles. Collectors of Customs Davis allowed the converted British warship Llang gorfe to over stay its twenty-four hour leave in San Francisco harbor. Washington decided that, because Sunday intervened, the overstay was not a violation of neutrality. Parts of submarines, manufactured in the Union Iron works here, were smuggled into Canada for assembly. United States and Canadian officials in collusion, permitted Japs to reach Canada to reinforce crews of Jap anese warships.

Under the caption 'Gulliver Wakes Up," Joseph Reinach, thts political writer, in an article in the "Figaro" comments at length on President Wilson's message to con gress. He declares" the message was animated by righteous anger, although not altogether free from metaphysics. It is evident, says M.

FALL ON SERBIANS Albanian Tribesmen Rise Against Ancient Foe. Austrian Forces Enveloping Enemy in Black Mountains. Berlin, Dec. 9. The outstanding feature of the situation on the Serbian front as shown by information receiv ed here is that Albanian tribesmen. j particularly the redoubtable Arnauts, have risen against the fragments of the Serbian forces which have suc ceeded in getting across the frontier into the Albanian mountains. Military writers here express the be lief that the Serbians have little mercy to expect from the Albanians who still maintain the blood feud, declared after the Serbian assimilation of the tribesmen in the parts of Albania oc cupied by them during and after the Balkan war with Turkey. All Armies Out. With the exception of a small band of Serbians, the remnant of the Mon aster army north of Ochrida Lake, no j part of the Serbian armies remains on Serbian soil, it is stated. The fugi j fives, without artillery or troop trains, and only supplies they can carry on ! their backs, are struggling not only with the pursuing Bulgarians, Auslro Germana and hostile Albanians, but with the rigors of full winter in the pathless Albanian mountain. Military men here express the belief that not even a fragment will succeed in cross ! ins- Alban'a to the sea. The Montenegrin army with such Serbians as were able to retreat in conlunction with it, is said to be in slightly better plight. The Montene grins have been driven from thir strong mountain positions along the i crest of the Suhodof range, 3,500 fet high on the northeastern frontier. The Austrians stormed these positions at , the point of the bayonet after suffi t cient artillery preliminaries, j Austrians Win Victory, j The Montenegrins were "badly de j feated, it is reported, but managed to j retreat in an intact body, and are ! conducting operations on their own soil with a line of retreat and supply ' through a friendly country.

I i I Washington. Dec. 9. Oermany is about ready for peace with less spoils of war than she has so far demanded: according to an outline of the terms that would be acceptable which was given to the Tribune today by a Ger man, long resident in America, but in intimate touch with Berlin's policies. The statement is unofficial, but it is believed to reflect accurately the views now held by the kaiser's ad visers. The peace terms, as outlined, are as follows; Germany to have full power over the Balkans, insuring her a road to Constantinople and Asia Minor, thus giving her a "place in the sun" inde pendent of British sea power. Buffer states to be maintained be tween Germany and Russia including the proposed new kingdom of Poland and the htrengthening of Kumania. The restoration of the old boundar ies in the west with complete freedom for Belgium and even possibly a siight concession to France of the French speaking parts of Alsace. There is no mention of indemnities or of Dr. Dernburg's demand for freedom of the seas." "There is nothine to all this peace talk," said the Tribune's informant. "Nothing v.-ill ever come out of 'peace talk ' If any power were to suggest peace now her enemies would decide that she was weakenine and that by keeping tvp a little longer they could get much more.
