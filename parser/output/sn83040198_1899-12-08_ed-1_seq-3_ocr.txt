Taylor, of Ohio, Questioned the Bight of the PolygamUt to Stt and a Committee Will Look into Hi Caae The Senate Session Wa Brief and Both Hooim ' Ad j earned Early. Washington, Dec. 5. The opening of the Fifty-sixth congress at noon yester day attracted that widespread atten tion which always attaches to the an nual assembling- of the national law makers. There was added interest in the event this year, for the many far reaching questions awaiting- consider ation gave unusual importance to the SPEAKER DAVID B. HENDERSON. return of congress. Aside from this, the Eoberts case introduced a phase which promised something outside of the ordinary developments of an open ing day. Early in the day, the throngs began converging at the the capitol. The day was bright and propitious and the thoroughfares leading to the building presented a gay and animated appear ance. As early as 10:30 o'clock the conspicuous figures of congress began to arrive, and this served to give the waiting throngs a temporary diversion. Gen. Henderson went direct to the speaker's private office, where he shared his time with the house leaders and with those pleading for admis sion cards. Representative Richardson, of Ten nessee, the democratic house leader, was also early on the scene, conferring with his lieutenants. Shortly before 11 o'clock Mr. Roberts, of Utah, in silk hat and black frock suit, made his way through the crowd to the members' private lobby. Here he chanced to meet Mr. Richardson and the two held a short conference as to whether Mr. Roberts would seek to address the house. A buzz of comment followed the gentlemen from Utah wherever he. went, but there was no disrespectful demonstration. Henderson, of Iowa; Richardson, of Tennessee; John C. Bell, of Colorado, and Francis G. Newlands, of Nevada, were named for speaker. Morris, of Minnesota; Overstreet, of Indiana, and Carmack, of Tennessee, were appointed tellers. Mr. Newlands, himself a can didate, voted for Mr. Richardson. The roll clerk said: "Henderson. 177; Rich ardson, 15S; Bell, 4, and Newlands, 2." The clerk thereupon announced the election of Mr. Henderson amid great republican applause. He designated Mr. Richardson, Mr. Bell and Mr. Newlands as a committee to escort the speaker to the chair. In accordance with the time-honored custom, the oldest member of thf house in point of service, Mr. Harmer. of Pennsylvania, administered the oatr to the speaker. The speaker then an nounced that the oath would be ad ministered to the members by states. As the names of members were callec they appeared at the bar in groups oJ about a dozen and there, with raised bands, were sworn .in by the speaker. When the name of Brigham H. Rob erts was reached in the house roll-call, the Utah member-elect proceded alonf to the arena in front of the speaker' BRIO HAM H. ROBERTS. (Whose Seat Is Being Contested) 4esk and awaited the administration of the oath. At the same time Repre sentative Taylor, of Ohio, secured rec ognition aud amid breathless interest protested against " the swearing-in of Roberts, on the ground of his being a polygamist and not a properly natur alized American citizen. Mr. Taylor spoke calmly and dispassionately. Mr. Roberts stood gazing intently at him - and not once -moved a muscle through out the protest. , Representative- McRae, of Arkansas, followed with a protest from the dem ocratic side, saying this issue was. one involving the sacredness of the Amer ican home, a sentiment that brought an outburst of applause. Speaker Henderson then addressed Roberts, saying: "Will the gentleman stand aside until the roll -call is com pleted?" Mr. Eoberts assented with 'be statement-that in -so loing h waived none of his rights. can as sure the' gentleman," answered the speaker, that he waives none of his rights by this course." It was agreed by unanimous consent that the consideration of the resolu tion should go over until to-morrow after the reading of the president's message. The swearing in of the re maining members was then concluded. The officers of the house. Clerk Mc Dowell of Pennsylvania; Sergeant-at-Arms Casen, of Wisconsin; Doorkeeper Gleen, of New York, and Postmaster McElroy, of Ohio, were elected. The following is the text of Repre sentative Taylor's resolution for the appointment of a special ' committee to investigate the Roberts case: Whereas, It is charged that Brigham H. Rob erts, a representative-elect to the Fifty-sixth congress from the state of Utah, is ineligible to a seat in the house of representatives, and Whereas, Such a charge is made through a a member of the house on his responsibility as such tn ember, and on the basis, as he asserts, of public records, affidavits and papers evidenc ing such ineligibility. Resolved, That the question of the prima facie right of Brixham H. Roberts to be sworn in as a representative be referred to a special committee of nine members of the house to be appointed by the speaker and until such com mittee shall report upon the house and decide such question and right, the said Brigham H. Roberts shall not be sworn in or be- permitted t occupy a seat in this house: and said com mittee shall have power to send for persons and papers and examine witnesses on oath in rela tun to the subject matter of this.

DESPERATE COURAGE ON BOTH SIDES, rwlllght Pell Upon an Undecided BatUe, aod the Boer, Porce of .11,000 'Retired Without Any Disorder, Carrying OS Their Gans and Equipments British "Were Too Exhausted to Pursue Them. London, Dec 5. The latest details eceived from Modder river seem to :how that even the desperate courage .he attacking force displayed all day ong (November 28) failed to drive the Boers from their stong entrenchments, ihd night fell on an undecided battle But, apparently, during the course of ;he night Gen. Cronje, commanding ;he Boers, who are said to have num bered 11,000 men, decided that the itruggle was hopeless, for the British found the town and surrounding posi ;ions evacuated when daylight broke. tnd the whole British army crossed the river and encamped on the Boer posi tions. The experts here are unanimous in sxpressing the opinion that Kimber ley'a needs must be very pressing to induce Gen. Methuen to expose the whole of his command to the Boer xiarksmen, snugly entrenched in a Jemi-circular position. So deadly was :he fire - zone that the Scotts guards were compelled to leave their Maxim runs behind when they were forced to seek less exposed ground. It was only after dark that a portion of the British troops succeeded in crossing the river by a mill dam on the extreme left. When night fell the Boer artillery fire tvas still as vigorous as in the morning, but the Boers' retirement in the night saved the , situation for the British. The exhausted condition of the British troops precluded the possibility of a pursuit of the enemy. The conclusion of the correspondents that the Boers must have suffered beavily must be confirmed from offi cial sources before it is accepted as a fact. In any case, the Boers retired tvithout any sign of disorder, carrying off their guns and equipment. Thus Gen. Conie's force is still intact. The fact that Gen. Methuen and CoL Keke- wich are now-in communication may cause a reconsideration of the Boer commander's plan to give battle at Spytfontein, where he might be simul taneously attacked by both British forces. It is reported that Modder river bridge has been repaired, and that the British resumed their march towards Kimberley to-day. Has Methuen Entered Kimberley? London, Dec 5. The Evening News says it learns that a cable dispatch was received to-day from an officer of the guards saying simply: "In Kimber ley," which, it is added, may mean that Gen. Methuen's vanguard has entered Kimberley. Another Account of the Fight. Cape Town, Nov. SO. (Delayed in transmission). Some details of the Modder river battle are at last at hand. The battle was fousrht with the river between armies. The Boers had five miles of intrenchmentson the northern bank. For several hours there was an artillery duel, when there was a lull in the Boer fire, and the British infantry advanced to the river bank without cover, hoping to force a passage over to the Boer position. The British were simply mowed down in this and attempted and re peated efforts to cross were frustrated by the Boer guns. Finally a few of the guards got across and held a posi tion on the north bank despite heavy odds. Some of the British tried to swim the river, but were forced back and nearly drowned. The Boers held their position till darkness ended the fight, when they retired unseen with their guns to a new position to the northward. A large "part of Gen. Me thuen's force then crossed the river. A MILLION A DAY. That Sam Represents the Amount of Prod acts Shipped Here from Uncle Sam's New Tropical Possessions. Washington, Dec 5.
