Remarkable Growth of the Country la ' Commerce and Manufacture -The Tarlfl Question Reviewed -Capital and I.nijor -The Work of the Kxecutive Depart menu. President Harrison sent his lust annual message to Congress on Tuesday, in which he says: In submitting my annual message to Congress, I have great satisfacliou in being able to say that the general condi tions affecting the commercial and industrial interests of the United States are iu the highest degree favorable. A comparison pf the existing conditions with those of the most favored period in the history of the couutry will, 1 believe, show that so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the com forts of life were never before enjoyed by our people. The total wealth of the country iu 1860 was $16,159,616,068. Iu 1890 it amounted to $62,610,000,000. an increase of 287 per cent. The message, after setting forth the increase in manufactures and growth of foreign and coastwise trade, take- up the tariff subject. On this the Presi dent says: I believe that the protective system, which has now for something more than thirty years continuously prevailed in our legislation, has been a mighty instru ment for the development of our national wealth aud a most powerful agency 'in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve tc our working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread but supply a comfortable margin for those home attractions and family comfort and enjoyments without which life i neither hopeful nor sweet. They are American citizens a part of the great people for whom our Constitution and government were framed and instituted and it can not be a perversion of that Constitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the comfort, independence, loyalty and sense of interest in the gov ernment which are essential to good citizenship in peace, and which will bring this stalwart throng, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag when it is as sailed. It Is not my purpose to renew here the argument in favor of a protective tariff. The result of the recent election must be accepted as having intro'duced a new policy. The contention has not been between schedules, but between principles, aud it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into legislation the principles advo cated by it aud the pledges given to the people. The tariff bills passed by the House of Representatives at the last ses sion were, as I suppose even in the opinion of their promoters inadequate, and justified only by the fact that the Senate aud House of Representatives were not in accord, and that a general revision could not, therefore be under taken. I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the in coming Congress. On the subject of capital and labor the message says: The strained and too often disturbed relations existing be tween the employees and the employers in our great manufacturing establish ments have not been favorable to a calm tem. The fact that his wages were the highest paid in like call in cm ;n Mia m.A and that a maintenance of this rate of wages, in the absence of protective du ties upon the product of his labor, was impossible were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review the question in the light of Ins personal experience under the op eration of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby main tained or increased, either absolutely or in their purchasing power, and that the actrrecatfi vnlnmo f uri-ir . u j ; L tins country is increased, or even main- wunea, so tnat there are more or as many day's work in a year at as good or better wages for the American workman as has been the case under the protective system, every one will rejoice. Our relations with Canada are referred to, aud the commercial attitude of that government to the United States is such that the President recommends a radical revision of our trade relations with that couutry, but on an intimate and friendly basis. The regret is made that iu many of the controversies, notably those as to the fisheries on the Atlantic, the sealing mteiestson the Pacific, aud the canal tolls, our negotiations with Great Britain nave continuously been thwarted or re tarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protests from Canada. an report or the Secretary ot the Treasury on the financial condition of the government is dwelt upon at length ; the 

(3......UC.U.UU ut bIIU aruiy service is recommended, the work of the various Departments is complimented, and the new navy is pointed to with pride. Concerning the Pension Bureau, the President says: I believe that the organ, izatiou is efficient, and that the work lias been done with fidelity. The pas sage of what is known as the disability bill lias, as w as foreseen, very largely in creased the annual disbursements to the disabled veterans of the civil war Tln estimate tor tins fiscal year was $144 956.000, and that amount was approprl ? A deficiency amounting to $10. o08,621 must be provided for at this ses sion. The estimate for pensions for the 2?S nearm?lldiS June 30 1894, is $165, 000,000. The Commissioner of Pension., believes that, if the present legislation and methods are maintained and further additions to the pension laws are not made, the maximum expenditure foi pensions will be reached June 30, 1894 and will be at the highest point $188,000, 000 per annum.

The Answer Not Satisfactory. The committee representing the loco motive engineers of the New York Cen tral Railroad have recieved an unsatis factory answer from President Depew to their request that hereafter the road officials treat with a single committee representing the engineers instead of committees representing the lodges. He answers in polite terms, but avoids the point at issue. The engineers say thev n?iil ii.n;nl Al. r j . . -. kuown the pompany is unwilling to tea t further.

NATIONAL CAPITAL EVENTS OF INTEREST IN CON GRESS AND THE DEPARTMENTS. Work of Congress. Congress got finally settled lown tc work on Monday of this week. The nnti option bill was brought up in the Senate, and seems likely to be the oration of a more determined struggle than last session. Many petitions, both for and agaiust the bill, were presented. .Mr. Hoar, from the Judiciary Commit tee presented a bill providing penalties agaiust persons, not a ship's crew, whe iid or encourage riot on American hips, which was passed. Many memorials and bills were pre sented in the House, which took their places on the calendar. Mr. Cummings, of N. Y. , secured the passage of a reso lution to investigate charges that the postal authorities exclude newspapers from the privileges of the mails without previous notice to publishers, and of other irregular practices. Several bills have been introduced upon the currency question, and that subject will come up for early action, and will probably be the most exciting subject of discussion during the session. A comprehensive hill to enable national banks to, .increase t.eir circulation and to suspend further purchases of silver was introduced by Representative Andrews of Massachu setts. Notes. Silver men have no hope of any fa vorable legislation at this session of Con gress. G. M. Lamberton, of Lincoln, Neb., lias been selected as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, to succeed Sir. Nettle ton. It is now thought no effort will be made by the Democrats in Congress to get New Mexico and Arizona in as States t lis session. Colonel John B. Weber, Commissionei of Immigration at New York, has placed his resignation at the disposal of the Sec retary of the Treasury. The Secretary of War states that a balance of $3,732 is still due the State of Pennsylvania for moneys expended by that State for the use of the United States n 1864. A rumor has gained currency in Wash ington that Mr. Blaine, whose ill health continues, is making arrangements to enter the Roman Catholic church, His friends give no credence to it. The President has appointed Genio M. Lambertson. of Nebraska. First Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Among other appointments sent to the Senate are the following: James W. McDill, Iowa, In terstate Commerce Commissioner; Per--,ou C. Cheney, New Hampshire, Minister to Switzerland; Peter S. Grosscup, Judge of the northern district of Illinois; Charles C. Cole, U. S. District Attorney for the District of Columbia. The " PubllcJedger" Building Burned. The massive six-story Public Ledger building at the southwest corner of owneTDyffiVwVfl"knownpl?iianthropisti George W. Childs, was nearly ruined by fire aud water about 6 o'clock Tuesday evening. The damage bv fire was con- 'hied almost entirely to the composing room, situated on the top floor, but a vonencot water poured down througl nie ouuuing, nooning everv floor in the structure. The loss will" probablv be about $250,000. Insurance on building $160,000; on contents $80,000. There was no interruption iu the Dublicatiou of the Public Ledger, as Mr. Childs had provided for such an emergency by hav iug a duplicate plant in another build ing. Iu recognition of the heroism of the firemen, Mr. Childs sent Mayor Stuart a check for $5,000 for the Police and Fire men's Pension Fund, and when the fire was under control he arranged to have the police aud firemen provided with coffee and supper at a neighboring res taurant.
