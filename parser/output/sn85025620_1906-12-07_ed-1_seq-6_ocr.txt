Hundreds went away disap­ pointed in hot gaining admission to witness the session of either senate or house. Speaker Cannon appointed Repre­ sentative James R. Mann of Illinois as a member of the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institute, vice Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, deceased. After the appointment of the usual committee to wait upon the president and inform him that the house was organized and ready to receive any communication he might desire to make of interest to the public service, the house adjourned out of respect to the memory of the deceased members. No bills were introduced in the sen­ ate. In the house there was 38 public measures and 350 of a private charac­ ter.

"?aar-: MILLIONS"W RUSSIANS IN THE VOLGA piSTRICT IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE, Crops In 8even Provinces Are a Total Failure and in Twenty Others the- Harvest* Are Very Poor—Estimated That 8eventy-five Million Dollars' Will Be Needed to Relieve the' Distress. ,'v St- Petersburg, Dec. 3.—Princes* Lvoff and OrbelianC the representa­ tives of the Moscow zemstvo famine relief organisation, who have just re­ turned from the stricken districts,: haye furnished the Associated Press with the following facts regarding the., conditions in the famine provinces: The crops in the seven provinces' of Samara, Saratov, Sembirsk, Kazan, Penza, Tambov and Ufa were practi­ cally total failures. In twenty prov­ inces the harvests* were very poor. About 20,000,000 people will need as­ sistance for from four to ten months to stave off starvation until the new ferops are available. Though affecting 18,000,000 persons the destitution is far less intense than it was in 1891. In some regions the inhabitants have been suffering from starvation for ten years, passible crops having been gath­ ered in only two of the ten years. Prince Lvoff believes the government estimate of $50,000,000 for famine re­ lief is inadequate. The Moscow zemst­ vo relief organization calculates that $75,000,000 and possibly more will be necessary. Though the conditions in the famine regions are now distressing far worse may be 1 exP**6** in January. The zemstvo organization funds will then be exhausted and the relief commit­ tees will be compelled to cease their efforts for the starving peasants. Prince Lvoff complained that the local offi­ cials, for political reasons, are inter­ fering with the establishment of soup kitchens and the rendering of medical assistance. He reported cases where petty func­ tionaries prohibited assistance being given to famine sufferers. Epidemics of hunger, typhus and scurvy, which usually began in February, already have appeared in three provinces— Tulla, Kazan and Samara.
