SUPPLEMENT. President's Message. To the Comres of the United States: At the threshold of your deliberations I con- fTHtulutP you upiu the favorable aspect of he domestic aim foreign affairs of this Gov OUR RELATIONS. Our relation with other countries continue to be upon a friendly foot in if. With tho Ar- femine Republic, ltelghim. tiraztl, Den in ink, lnyti. Italy, Snnta Domingo, Sweden and Nor way m inrl'leut bus oeenrred which calls for special comment. The reecutopeninir of telo graptrie cnminuniration with Central America and hnt.il permitted tho Interchuntfw of mes ph ires of friendship with the Governments of thone eonniries. During the year there have been perfected and proclaimed consular and commercial treat ic-4 with Servia and a consu lar treaty with Houtnuuia, thus extending our intercourse w ith tho Dttnuhiun count rie8 while our Katrn relatives have been put upon a wider luisis by treaties with 4'orca and Mada gaseiir. The new boundary survey tri'itty with Mexico, a trades mark .convention and a sup plementary treaty of extrudition with tpain and conventions extending the duration ol tho JKrnneo-American 1 laims Commission have also been proclaimed. 

TERMINATION OF THE FISHERIES ARTICLES. the termination of tho tisherie articles of the Treaty of Wtedjlnytun was duly given to tbe British Government. The privi leges u ii' I exemptions of the British liovern meut and the reciprocal privileges and exemp tions of the treaty will accordinu-ly cease July 1, 14. The fisheries, an industry pursu"d by a numerous rla-s of our citizen on the north ern coast, both on the Atlantic and the 1'acilie ocean-, are worthy of the fosierintr care of Coiiifress. Whenever brought iiitocompetitton with the like industries of other countries our tNhermcii as well as our manutacturers of flshintr Hpphances and preparers of finh pro ducts, bnvp maintained a foremost pi nee. I bu if we st that Coinrress create a commission to consider the ircneral question of rights in tho flshris and the means of opening to citizens. Under just and endurinir conditions, the richly Blocked fishing waters and sealinif grounds of Uritisli and Kussian North America. PAUPER IMMIGRATION. The nu''d''n ha arisen touch inir tho depor tation to tho United States, from the British Islands, by Governmental or municipal aid, of persons unable there to gtiln a living' und eiully a burden on the community here. Such of those persons as will come under tho pauper class, ns defined by law, have been Bent pack in accordance with the provisions of our tututes. Her Majesty's Government has in Bisted that precautions have been taken bo fore mHkliur shipments. It has, however, in many cases proven ineffectual and especially o In certain recent instances of needy emi irrnnts reaching our territory through Canada that some of otir leirislation upon this subject - be deemed advisable. CLAYTON BULWER TREATY. Correspondence relative to the Cluyton-Bul-Wor treaty has been continued and will bo laid before Conjrress. SWINE PRODUCTS. The legislation of France against the Im portation of prepared swino products from the I'nited States has been repealed. That : result has been due no less to tho friendly i representative of this Government than to a j BTowiiuf conviction in France that the restric tion is not demanded by any real danger to health. Germany still prohibits tho introduc tion of nit swine products from America. I extended to the Imperial (fovernment a friend ly invitation to wend experts to the I'nited States to Inquire whether tho ue of these products was dantrorous to health. This in vitation was declined. I have believed it of uch importance, however, that the exact facts should be ascertained and promulgated that I have appointed a competent commis sion to make u thorough investigation of the subject. Its members have shown their pub lic spirit by accepting their trust without pledge of compensation : but I trust that I 'on- fnes will see in tho National aii'l interna tional bearinirs of the matter a sutlieient mo tive of providing at leut for reimbursement of such expeubca as they may necessarily CORONATION OF THE CZAR. The coronation of the Czar at Moscow af forded to tho Government an occasion for tes tifying its continued friendship by sending a special envoy and a representative of the navy to attend the ceremony. While (here have arisen during tho year no rave questions affecting tho status in the jkussjitn Kmpire of American citizens or other faith than that held by the Church, this Gov ernment remains ttrm In Its convictions that the ritrhts of its citizens abroad should be in So affected their religious belief. TRADE WITH CUBA. measures re moval of the restrictions which now burden our trade with Cuba and Porto Kicoare under consideration by tho Spanish Government. The proximity of Cuba and the peculiar meth ods of administration which there prevail ne cessitate constant discussion and appeal on Our part from the proceedings of the insular authorities. I reirret to say that the Just pro tects of this Government have not as yet produced satisfactory result. The commis sion appointed to decide certain claims of our citizens atminst the Spanish Government, aft er the reeoif nit-lon or a satisfactory rule as the validity and force of naturalization in the United States, has finally adjourned. Some of its awards, though niado more than two years an, have not been paid. The Specie payment is expected. Claims to large amounts, which were held by the late Com missioner without its Jurisdiction, has been diplomatically presented to the Spanish Gov ernment, as the action of the Colonial author ities which has iriven rise to those claims was admittedly illegal, full reparation for tho in- iuries sustained lv our citizen should be no oiitrer delayed. The case of tho Masonic has not yet reached a settlement. Tho Manilla court has found that the proceeding of which this Government has complained were unauthor ized and it is hoped that the Government of Spain will not withhold the speedy reparation which iu sense of Justice should impel it to offer for the unusual severity and unjust action of insubordinate Colonial officers In the case of this vessel. THE HELVETIAN CONFEDERATION. The Helvetian Confederation has proposed the intuigurtitinn of a class of international treaties for the arbitration of grave questions between nations. This Government has as sented to the proposal, and negotiations of uch a treaty with Switzerland, under the treaty of Berlin, liberty of conscience and civil rights are assured to all strangers in Bulgaria. A the United States have no dis tinctive mentionod relations with that coun try and are not a party to the treaty, they should. In my opinion, maintain diplomatic representation for the Improvement of Inter course and the proper protection of the many American citizens who resort to that country as missionaries and teachers. I suggest that I be Riven authority to estah Ifsh an agency and a Consulate General at the tultfarian capital. REVISION OF THE TARIFF OF OTTOMAN EMPIRE. The Cnitod States are now participating In a revision of the tariff of the Ottoman Empire. They have assented to the application of a license tax to foreigners doing business In Turkey, but have opposed the oppressive toraire tax upon petroleum entering the port of that country. The Government of the Khedive has pro- fiosod that tho authority of the mixed Judicial ibunals In Egypt be extended so as to cover citizens of the L nited States accused of crime, who are now tried before consular courts. This Government Is not indisposed to accept the change, but believes that the terms should be submitted for critff ism to the Commission appointed to revise the whole subject. RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. our bistory has there been more manifest need of clone and lasting relations with a neighboring State than now exists with respect to Mexico. The rapid In flux of our capital and enterprise into that country shows by what has already been ac complished the vast reciprocal advantages which must attend the progress of Its Internal development. The treaty of commerce and navigation of ft8 has been terminated by the Mexican Government and the absence of conventional engagements the rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend upon the do meat lc star utes of that Kepu hi io. There bave been Instances of barsta enforcement of the laws against our vessels and citizens in Mexico and of denial of the diplomatic resort for their protection. The Initial step toward a better understanding has been taken In the nerotiatlons by the Commission author ised by Congrea of a treaty which is still bo fore the Senate awaiting ita approval. The ? revisions for the reciprocal crossing of the rontler bv the troops in pursuit of hostile ndlans. nave been prolonged for another year. The operations of the forces of both 4torernmenu against the savages have been successful, and several of tholr most danger ous bands have been captured or dispersed by tho skill and valor of t nl ted Status and Mexican Holdiers fighting In a common cause. BOUNDARY FROM THE RIO GRANDE TO THE PACIFIC. The convention lor the reiurvey of tho boundary from the Hlo Grande to the 1'aeiliu having been ratillcd and exchanged, the pre liminary recoaiiaisuncn therein stipulated has been affected. It row rests with Congress to make provision for completing the survey and lelomting the boundary monument. REHEARING OF CASES. A vHmveiitttm was signed with Mexico July il providing for the rchosrhnr of the cases f Henjainin Weil and the Abra Silver Mining tompany, in whoso lavor awards wero mado by tho late- American and Mexican Claims Commission. That convention Btill awaits action of the Senate. Meanwhile, because of the charges or fraudulent a wan la which have made a new commission uevessary, the Kxeeu tive has directed the suspension of payments of the distribuiiveuuota received from Mexico, CENTRAL AMERICA. Our geographical proximity to Central America and our political and commercial re lations with the Slates of that country Justify, In my judgment, such a material increase of our consular corps as will place at each cap ital a Consul General. The contest between Bolivia, Chili and Peru has passed from the stago ofstrngetle hos tilities to that of negotiation, in which tho counsels of this Government has been exercised. The demands of Chili for absolute cession of territory have been maintained and accepted by the party of Geuoral Iglesias to the extent of the concluding treaty of peace with the Government of Chill In general con formity with the terms of tho protocol signed in May last bet ween the Chilian commander, General Iglesias. As the result of tho con clusion of this treaty General Iglesias was tormally recognized by Chili as President of Iricru, and his Government installed at Lima, which has been evacuated by tho Chilians. A call has been Issued by General Iglesias for a representative assembly to be elected on the Mtb of January and to meet at .Lima on tho 1st of March next. While ihe provisional government of Gen eral Iirletdas has applied fur recognition to the principal powers id' America und Mil rope, when the will of the Peruvian people shall be manifested 1 shall not hesitate to recognize the government approved by them, diplo matic and naval representatives In this Gov ernment attended at Cararcas the centennial celebration of tho birth of the illustrious llnlivar. At the same time the inauguration of the statueof Washington in the Vene.uele an capital testified tr. the veneration in which his memory is held tiiere. Congress at its last session authorized tho Executive to propose to tho Venezuleun gov ernment a reopening of tho awards of the Mixed Commission of Cararcas. Tho depart ure from this country of the Veuezueiean Minister has delayed tho opening of negotia tions for reviving I he 'om mission. The Gov ernment hold that until the establishment of a treaty upon this sublect the Venezuelean Government must continue to make tho pay ments movided for in the convention of iNitf. There i.i uround tor believing that the dispute growinir out of the unpaid obligations duo from Venezuela to France will be satisfacto rily adjusted. The French Cabinet lias pro posed a binds of settlement which meets my approval, but as it involves a recasting of the annual quotas of the foreign debt it has been deemed udvMablc to submit the proposal to tho judgment of the cabinets of lieilin, Co penhagen, Tho Hague,' London and Madrid. 

TREATY WITH HAW ALL. At the recent coronation of Ills Majesty, Kiuur Kalakaua, this Government was repre sented both diplomatically and by the forma visit of a vessel of war. The question of terminating or modifying the existing reciprocity treaty with Hawaii is now before Couktcss. I tun convinced that the charges of alius and frauds under that treaty have been exiiMTKcrated, ami I renew , the suggestion of last year's message, that j the treaty be modified wherever itsprovisiuns have proven onerous to legitimate trade be tween inc two couniries. i am not ui.-poseii to favor the entire cessation of treaty rela tions which have fostered good will between the count ries and contributed toward ttio of Hawaii In the of LEGATIONS TO EASTERN COUNTRIES. In pursuance of the policy declared by this Government of extending our interests with Eastern nations legations haveduring the past year been established In Persia, Si a in and Coreti. It in probable that permanent mis sions of these countries wiil ere long bo main tained in the 1'niied States. A special embassy from Sisra Is now on Its wav hither, and trenty relations with Coroii were perfected by exchim-'O at Leoul on the 1Mb of May last or ratilications of the lately concluded convention, anil envoys from tho Kinif of Tab Chosun have visited thlscountry and received a cordial welcome. Corea. as yet unacquainted with the meth ods of Western civilization, now invites the attention of those interested In the advance ment of our foreign trade, as it needs the im plements and products which the I'nited States are ready to supply. Wo seek no mo nopoly of its commerce and no advantage over other nation-, but as the Chnsuns in reaching for a higher civilization have con tided in this itopublic, wo cannot regard with Indifference any encroachment on thei r rights. China, by the paymont of a money Indem nity, has settled certain of tho long pending claims of our eil izens, and I have strong hopes that the remainder will soon bo ad- RIGHTS OF AMERICANS IN CHINA. Questions have arisen touching the rights of American and other foreign manufacturers in China under the provisions of treaties which permit aliens to exercise their industries in that country. On this specific point our own treaty is silent, but under the operation of tho most favored nation clause, wo have like privi leges with those of other powers, while it is the duty of the Government to see that our citizen, bavethe full enjoyment of every bene fit secured by treaty, 1 doubt the expediency of leading in a movement to constrain China to admit an interpretation which we havoonly an indirect treaty right to exact. The transference to China of American capital for the employment there of Chinese labor, would In effect Inaugurate a competi tion for the control of markets now sup.'diedy our home industries. There is good reason to believe that the law restricting the immigra tion of Chinese has been violated, intention ally or otherwise by tho officials of China, upon whom is devolved the duty of certifying that the immigrants belong to tho excepted cl.tsses. Measures have been taken to ascer tain the facts incident to this supposed In fraction and It is believed that tho Government of China will co-operate with the United States in securing tho faithful observance of the law. CANTON INDEMNITY FUND. The same considerations which prompted Congress at its last session to return to Japan the Siuioneski (indemnity seems to me to re quire at its hands like action In respect to the Canton Indemnity fund now amounting to three hundred thousand. The question of the general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan has been considered in an international conference held at Tokio but without definite result as yet. This Government is disposed to concede the requests of Japan to determine Its own tariff duties, to provide such proper judicial tribunals as may commend t hem wives to tho Western powers for the trial of cases to which foreigners are parties and to assimilate the terms and duration of Its treaties to those of other civilized States. RELATIONS WITH LIBERIA. Throuirh our ministers at London and at Monrovia this Government has endeavored to aid Liberia in its dilfnrences witb Great Britain touching the northwestern boundaries of that republic. 'J here Is a prospect at adjustment of tho dispute by the adoption ot tho Man nab r ver as tho line. This arranif -nient is a com promise of the conflicting territorial claims and take from Liberia no country over which It baa maintained effective Jurisdiction. AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS. The rich and populous valley of the Con bo is being opened to commerce by a society called the International African Association, of which the King of tho Belgians la President, and a citizen of tbe United States tbo chief executive otfleer. Lartro tracts of territory have been ceded to the association by native chiefs, roads have been opened, steamboats placed on the river and tho neti clus of seats established at twenty-two sta tions under one flag, which offers freedom to commerce and prohibits the slave trade. The objects of tho society are philanthropic. It does not aim at permanent political control but seeks the neutrality of the valley. The United States cannot be indifferent to this work, nor to the interests of their citi Izens Involved in it. It may become advisa ble for us to co-operate with other commer cial powers in promoting tho rights of trade and resilience in the Congo valley free from the Interference or political control of any one Nation. 

SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC. In view of the frequency of Invitations from foreign governments to participate In a social and scientific con if reus for the discus sion of important matters of general concern, repeat toe suggestion of my last message, that provision bo mado for the exercise of discretionary power by the Executive in ap pointing delegate to such conventions. Specialists are ready to serve the National interests in such capacity without personal profit or other compensation than tho defray ment of expenses actually incurred, and this a comparatively small annual appropriation would suillce to meet. INTERESTS IN THE WEST INDIES. I have alluded in my previous message to the injurious and vexatious restrictions suf fered by our trado In the Spanish West Indies. Brazil, whoso natural outlet for Its great Na tional siavo co nee is in ana tnrouif n the u mien StaifS, imposes a heavy export duty upon that product; a like narrow policy is pursued in oiuer American countries. FOREIGN TRADE HAMPERED. petroleum exports are hampered In Turkey nnd in other Eastern ixirts bv restric tions as to storage nnd try taxation; and tho iree ourwaru movement or our great hmhi product Is in some quarters clourircd witb like linicilituenta. For those mischiefs attenuate relief is not always offered by recipr.'ity trwatles like that with Hawaii or that lately negotiated witb Mexico and now awaiting tho aouou ot tho senate. RETALIATORY MEASURES. Is It not advisable to provide some measure of equitable retaliation in relations with gov ernments which discriminate against our ownr It, Tor example, the executive were empowered to apply to banish vessels and cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Hlco the same rules of treatment and a scale of penalties for technical faults which are applied to our vessels and cargoes in the Antilles. A resort to that course mivht not no Darren or goon results. A discretionary authority to forbid the importation of articles of consumption injurious to health raftrht he advantageously exercised in our dealings with those who criminate against our food products.

Tf tho revenues for the fiscal year, which will end on Juno 30, 1RM5, bo estimated upon the basis of existing laws, the Secretary is of the opinion that, for that year tho receipts will exceed sixty millions, tho ordinary ex penditures including the amount devoted to tbe sinking funds. Hitherto tho surplus as rapidly as it has accumulated has been de voted to the reduction of the National debt. As a result tho only bonds now out standing which are redeemable at tbe pleasure of the Kovornrnont are tho three per cents, amounting to atiout $306,000,000. four and one half per cents, amounting to $25u,oo0,000, and tno $73?.00o,0no four per cents are not payable until Hill and 1WT, respectively. If tbesurplus shall hereafter be as largo as tho Treasury estimates now Indicate, tho three per cent, bonds may all be redeemed at least four years before anv of the four and one half per cents, can be called In. Tbe latter, at the same rate of accumulation, can be paid at maturity and tbe money requisite for the redemption of tho tour per cents, will be in tbo Treantiry manv years before tbose obligations become payable. PAYING THE DEBT TOO FAST. There are cogent reasons, however, why the National indebtedness should not be thus rapidly extinguished. Chief among them is the fact that only by excessive taxation is such rapidity attainable. In a communication to the Conirress at its last session I recom mended that all excise taxes be abolished ex cept those relating to distilled spirits, and that substantial reductions also be made in the revenues from customs. A statute has since been enacted by which tbe annual tax and tariff receipts of the Government have been cut down to the extent of at leant fifty or sixty millions of dollars. NO FURTHER REDUCTION. While I have no doubt that still further re ductions may be mado I do not advise the adoption at this session of any measures for a large diminution of National revenues. The results of the legislation of tho last session of Conirress have not as yet become sufficiently apparent to Justify any radical revision or sweeping modifications of tho existing law. DISPOSING OF THE SURPLUS. the which must elapse before the effects of tbe act of March 3, 183, can be defi nitely ascertained a portion at least of the surplus revenues may bo wisely applied to the long neglected duty of rehabltating our Nation and providing coast defenses for the protection of our harbors. THE NATIONAL CURRENCY. This In a matter to which I shall strain revert. Immediately asHnciatcd witb tbo financial sub ject Juut discussed is tbe liupaant question. What legislation is uco-IimI regarding National currency 't The aggregate amount of bonds now on deposit In tn Trousury to support tho National bank circulation is I.3.o.oih),(oO. Nearly two hundred millions of this amount coni-ts of three per ceuts., which, as already slated, are payable at tbo pleasure of the Cov eriiiuent and are likely to be called in within less than four years unless the surplus rev euues shall be dirnin shed. 1 CONTRACTING THE CURRENCY. The probable etVect of such an extensive retirement of the securities which are tho basis of tho National bank circulation would lie such a contraction of tho volume of cur rency as to produce grave commercial embar rassments. How can the danger be obviated? The most effectual plan, and oue whoso adop tion at tho earliest practicable opportunity I shall heartily approve, has already been Indi cated, if the revenues of tbe next four years shall be kept substantially com inensu rate with the expenses the volume of circulation w ill not bo likely to suffer any inatoriul dis turbance, but if, ou tbo other hand, t hero shall bo great delay In reducing taxation it will become necessary either to substitute some other form of currency In place of the National bank notes, or tn make important changes in tho laws by which their circula tion is now controlled. THE LEGISLATION NEEDED. In my judgment the latter course is far preferable. I commend to your ultentiou tho very interesting and thoughtful suggestions upon this subject which appear Initio Secre tary's report. The objections which be urircs against the acceptance of any ol her securities than the obligatiotiHot tho tiovei-iiment itself as a foundation for National bank circula tion, seem to ine insuperable). THE TOW PLANS. For averting the threatened contraction two courses have been suggested, either of which is probably feasible, line is tho issuance of new bonds, having many years to run. bearing a low rate of interest exehanireablo upon specified terms of tnos- now outstanding I ho other course which coin mentis it-ell to my own Judgment ss- the better, is i he enactment of a law repealim the tux on circulation nnd per mitting the batiks to issue notes fornu amount equal to ninety per cent, of the market value, instead as of now, the luce value of ilieir deposited bonds. 1 ngreo with tno Secretary in the belief that tbe adoption of Una plau would afford the relief. THE TRADE DOLLAR. The trade dollar was coined lor the purpose of tiallic in countries where silver passed at its value, as ascertained by lis welirlttuud tine ness. It never had a leal tender quality. Lai go numhers of theso coins entered, how ever. Into tho volume of our currency. By common consent their circulation in domestic trade has now censed and they h ive thus be come a diHiurbing element and they hbould not bo Ion or permitted to embarrass our cur rency system. I recommend that provision for tho;r reception by tho Treasury and tho mints as bullion at a small per eeulage above tho current market price of silver of like llno-ness. CONSOLIDATING CUSTOMS DISTRICTS. The Secretary of tho Treasury advises tho consolidation of certain of the customs dis tricts ot the country nnd suggests that tho 1' resident be vested wit h such power in rela tion thereto as Is now given him in respect to Collectors of Internal Kevonue by section 31 H of the revised statutes. Tbe statutes on this subject, which are contained In his report., furnished of themselves a strong argument in defence of his views. At tho adjournment of Congress the number of Internal Hevenuo collection districts was I,:'Mi. Ity executive orders dated June 1h3, I decided that cer tain of these districts be consolidated. The result has been a reduction of one-third their number, which at present Is but 830. 

INDIAN RELATIONS. From the report of the Secretary of War It wilt be seen that in only a siuirle inrtanco has there been any disturbance ol the quiet con dition of our Indian tribes a raid from Mexi co to Arizona by a small party of Indians, which was pursued by (teiieral Crook into tho mountain regions from which it had come. It Is confidently hoped that serious outbreaks will not again occur dim) that the I nd: an tribes which have for so many years disturbed the West will hereafter remain in peaceable submission. DEFENSELESS SEA COASTS. I again call your attention to the present condition of our extended sea coast, upon which are so many largo cities whose wealth and importance to the country would In time of war be open to attack from modern ar- moren snips against wtiicn our existing iiit tensive works could give no adequate protec tion. Thosu works wero built before the in troduction of modern heavy rifled guns Into maritime warfare, and if they are not put in an efficient condition wo tnuv easily be sub jected to humiliation by a houtUo power interior to ourselves. 

GUNS AND TORPEDOES. As germain to this subject, I call your at tention to the importance, of perfecting our submarine torpedo defenses. The board au thorized by tho last Congress to report on the method which should be adopted for the man ufacture of heavy ordnance adapted to mod ern warfare has visited the principal Iron and sNel works in this country and in Hurope. it is no pen that its report will !m soon mtuie and that Conirress will thereupon ho dis posed, to provlilo suitable facilities nnd plans for tho manufacture of such guns as are now temporarily needed ENCOURAGING STATE MILITIA. On several occasions durlnir the oast voar otllcersof the army have, ut the request of the State authorities, visited their military en campments for inspection of the troops. From the reports of tho officers I am induced to be lieve that the encouragement of the State, militia organization tv ttie National Govern ment would be followed by very" gratifying re sults and would tiftord It In sudden emergen cies the old of a I a rife body of volunteers edu cated In the performance of military duties. STRENGTHENING THE NAVY. Tho Secretary of the Navy reports that un der tho authority of th laws of Auirust 5, 1HH2. and March 3. IHkj, the work of stremrth- euingour navy by the construction of modern vessels has tteon auspiciously no mm. 1 hree cruisers are in process of construction tbo Chicago, of 4.-VH) tons displacement, and tho lloslon Hiiu Atianto, enen oi s.mhi tons. l ney are to be built of steel with the tensile strength and ductility prescribed bylaw, and in combi nation of speed, endurance and armament are expected to compare fnvi -rably with the best unarmed war vessels of other nations. A fourth vessel, the Dolphin, is to be construct ed of similar material and is intended to servo as a fleet dispatch boat. Tbe double turreted monitors Puritan, Amiihltrite and Terror have been launched on the Delaware Hiver and a contract has been made for the supply of their machinery. A similar monitor, the Monadnoek, has been launched in California. The Naval Advisory Hoard and the Secretary recommend the com pletion of tho monitors, the construction of four gunboats and also of three additional steel vessels liko tho Chicago, i Jos ton and Dolphin. COAST CANALS. an important measure fense the Secretary nrires also the immediate creation of an interior coast line of water ways across the peninsula of Florida, along the coast from Florida to Hampton roads, be tween tho Chesapeake Hay and the letaware river, and through ape Cod. A BETTER NAVY NEEDED. T ten) hnnnrl tn I in rrn iinon tho ntlnntlrtn of Congress the necessity of continuing pro gress in thi. reconstruction of the navy. The condition of the public Treasury, an I nave al- reauy intimaten, makes ine present an aus picious time for putting this branch of tho service in a state of eiliclcney. It Is no part of policy to create a navy able to eopo with mat or me otner great powers or ine worm. We have no wish for foreign conquest and the peace which we have long enjoyed Is in no seeming danifer of interruption, but that our naval strength should be msde adequate for the denfense of our harbors, tho protection of our commercial Interests and the maintenance, of our national honor is a proposition from wnico no patriotic citizen can witnnoiu nis assent. 

POSTAL AFFAIRS. The report of the. Postmaster Ooneral eon tains a gratifying exhibit of tho condition and prospects of Ihe interesting branch of tbo public service committed to his care. It ap pears that, on June 3n, ISKJ, the whole numler of post-ollices was 4.&tt; of which l,Ci were established during the previous fiscal year. The number of offices operating under tho system of free delivery was 1M. At these latter offices the postage on local matter amounted to $411.Wi.u;c;, a sum exceeding by 9105.1MM01 the entire cost of the carriers service of the country. The rate of postage on drop letters passing througb these offices is now fixed by law at two cents per half ounce or fraction thereof. ONE CENT POSTAGE. In offices where the carrier system has not been established the rate is only half as largo. It will be remembered that In 1S3, when free delivery was first established by law, the uni form single rate postage upon IochI letters was one cent, ana so it remained until is?-., when In those cities where carrier service was established it was Increased In order to defray the ex pen so of such service. It seems to me tbe old rate may now with propriety be restored; and tbat t woven at tbo risk of diminishing for a time at least tbe re ceipts from postage upon local letters, I can ee no reara why that particular class of mall matter should be hold accountable for too entire cost of not only itsown colleo i tion and delivery, but the collection and de livery of all other classes. nd 1 am confident after full consideration of tho subject that a reduction of ibe rato would be followed by such a growing accession oi business as to oc casion but slight and temporary loss to the revenue of tho ostoillce. GOVERNMENT TELEGRAPHS. Tho Postmaster General devotts much of his report to tbo consideration, iu its various aspects, of tbo relations ot ihe Government to the tcletrraph. As such reflection as I b ive been abl-4 to give to (bis subject since my I ist annual message has not led ine to change the view which 1 there expressed in dissenting from the recommendation of the Postmaster General, tbat the Government assume sumo control over tbe telegraph which it bas nlways exercised over Ibe mail, admitting that its authority in the premises Is as ample m bas ever been claimed for it, it would not in my Judirmout be wise to use. If that authority to purchase or ussutne tho control of exiting teleirrapb lines or to construct others with a view ot entering into a general competition witb PLANS PROPOSED. may against either of these projects, and indeed against any system which would require any enormous increase in tho civil service listed do not, however, apply to some of tho plans which have lately provoked public comment and discussion. 1 1 has been claimed, lor ex ample, that Conirress might wisely authorize tho Postmaster General lo contract with some private persons or corporation for the trans mission of messages at specified rales and un der Government supervision. Various such seliemcs of some general nature, but widely differing in their tpecial characteristics, have been su jested in the public prints, and the ariru incuts Ity which they have been supported and opposed: have doubtless attracted your attention. it is likely that tho whole subject will be considered by you at tho preseut session, in the nature ot things it involves so many ques tions of detail that your deliberations would probably be aided hut slightly If at all by any part iculur suggestions which I might now Huhiuif. I avow iny belief, however, that the government should be authorized bylaw to exercise some sort of supervision over inter state telegraphic communication tut' I. 1 ex press the hopo that for attaining that end some measure may be devised winch will re ceive your approbation. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The Attorney General criticises in his report the provisions of the existing law fixing the fises of Jurors and witnesses In tho l-edornl courts. These provisions are oh e'ly contained in tho net of February ;, Is. VI. though so-ne of them were Introduced into that actum irom statutes which had been passed many year previous, it is manliest such compensation mijrtit, when theso laws were enacted, hu o been just and reasonably would iu many in stances Po justly regarded at tbo present day as Inadequate. I concur wit ti tho Attorney General In tho belief that the stututos should be revised by which these fees are regulated. So, too, should the laws which rey ulato t ho compen sation of district attorneys and marshals. They should be paid wholly by salaries instead of in part by fees, as Is now the case. Tho change would prove to be a measure id' econ omy and would discourage the institution of needless und oppressive legal proceedings, which it is io be feared have in some instances been conducted for tho more sake of personal gain. THE 

INDIAN QUESTION. contained in tho report of the tccretury of the interior. 1 particularly call your atten tion to his presentation of certain phases of the Indian questions, to his recommendation for tho repeal of the pre-emption and timber cultivation acts and for more stringent leir islation to prevent frauds under thu pension luws. PENSION FRAUDS. Tho statutes which prescribe the definitions and punishment of crimes relating to pen sions could doubtless be made more effective by certain amounts and additions which are pointed out in the Secretary's report. ILLITERACY. I have previously referred to tho alarming state of illiteracy In certain portions or the country and again submit for i tie considera tion of Congress wiieth-r some Federal aid should bo extended to public primary educa tion wherever adequate provision thereloro bus not already been made. THE POLYGAMY PROBLEM. The rtan Commission bas submitted to the Secretary oi' tho Interior its sec nd anuu ii rqport. As a result of its latiors In supervis ing the recent election In that Territory pur suant to tbo act of March '."J, lw, it appears that the persons by that act disqualified, to the number of ahout l!i,lM, were excluded from the polls. This tact, however, affords little cause for congratulation, anfi 1 fear that it is far rom indicating any real and sul stantial progress toward the extirpation of pnlytramy. All of the members of tho LoKisTature are Mormons. There is grave reason to believe that they are in sympathy with tho practice that this Government is seeking tnsupprcss, und that itsefforts iuthut regard will be inoro likely to encounter op position than receive their encouragement and support. K von if this view should hni pily be erroneous the law under which the Commissioners have been acting should bo mado more effective by the incor poration of some such stringent measures as they recommend as were included in bill No. 5iH on the calendar of tho Senate at Us last session. I am convinced, however, that polygamy has become so strongly cn trenehed in the Territory of Utah that it is profitless to attack it with anv but the stout est weapons which constitutional legislation can fashion. 1 favor therefore the repeal of the act upon which the existing government depends, tin? assumption by the National Leg Mature of the entire political control of tho Territory and the establishment of a commis sion with such powers and duties as shall be delegated to it by law. AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS. Tho Department of Agriculture Is accom plishing much in tho direction of the agricul tural development of tho country and tho report of the Commissioner giving the results or his Investigations and experiments will bo found Interesting and valuable. At his in stance a convention of those interest oil in tho cattle Industry of the country was lately held at Chicago. Tho prevalence of pleuro pneu monia and other contagious disease of ani mals was one of the chief topics of discus sion. A committee if the convention will Invite your co-operation In Investigating tho causes of theMJ diseases and providing methods for their prevention and cure. GOVERNMENT FOR ALASKA. I trust that Congress will not fail In its pres ent session to put Alaska under protection of law. Its people have repeatedly remonstrated againstour rteirlect to afford them maintenance ami protection, expressly guaranteed by tho terms of tho treaty, whereby that territory was ceded to tbe Cuited Stales, tor sixteen years they have pleaded in vain for that which they should have received without tbe asking. They have no law for the protection of debts, the support of education, tbe con veyance of property, tbo ad min istration of estates, or the enforcement of contracts, none indeed for tho punish ment of criminals except such as oiTeud aguinst certain customs, commerce and navi Kation acts. The resources of Alaska, es pecially in fur, mines nnd lumber, are con siderable in extent and capable of largo de velopment, while Its geographical situation Is one of political and commercial importance. Tbe prompt liurs of Interest, therefore, us well as considerations of honor and good faith, demand tho Immediate establishment of a civil government iu that territory. INTER-STATE COMMERCE. Complaints have lately been numerous and urgent tbat certain corporations controlling in whole or In part tbo 1 acilitles for the inter state carriage of persons and merchandise over tbe great railroads of the country have resorted in their dealings with the public to divers measures unjust and oppressive In their character. In some instances tho Htate governments have attacked and suppressed theso evils, but in others tln-y have been unable to afford ad equate relief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are Imposed upon them by the Federal Constitution. Tho question how far the National government may lawfully Interfere in the premises, and what, if any supervision or control It oujrht to exorcise, is one which merits your careful consideration. CHECKING MONOPOLY. While we cannot fail to recognize the im port a nee of the vast railway systems of tho country and theirgreat and beneficial intiu ences upon the development of our material wealth, we should on tho other hand remem ber no Individual and no corporation ouvht to be invested with absolute power over the In terest of any other citizen or class of citizens. The right of these railway corporations to award a profitable return upon their Invest ments and to reasonable freedom In their regu lations must be recognized. Hut it seems only Just that so far as its constitutional autborliy w II permit Congress should protect tbe people at large in their inter-Ht ite traino airainst acts of lnjiitice which eUate Ooverninenta are powerless to protect, PRESERVING THE FORESTS. my annual message I called attention to tho necessity of protecting by suitable leg islation the forests situated upon the public domain. In many portions of the West tho pursuit of general agriculture Is only made practicable by resort to Irrigation, while suc cessful irrigation would bo impossible without the aid afforded by forest In contrib uting to the regularity and constancy of the supply of water. During the past year severe suffering ana great loss of property have been occasioned by profuse Hoods, followed by periods of un usually low water In many of tb" great rivers of tho country. Theso Irregularities were in great meusuro caused by the removal from ahout the sources of the streams In question of tbe timber by which the water supply had been nourished and protected. Tho preser vation of such ponVm of tho forests on th National domain as essentially coiitrlbulo to tho equal do Mow of Important water course! Is of the highest coiisii.uepee. Important tributaries of the Missouri, ihe Columbia and the Saskatchewan rise In tho mountains of Montana near tho northern boundary oV ttie I'nited States, between tho Ulnck fect and Flathead Indian reservations, ''his region is unsettled, but upon the rivers which flow from It depeuds In the future agricultural development or a vast tract of country. The attention ot Cengreas is called to the necessity of withdrawing from public sale this part of the public domain and establishing there a forest INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITIONS. The Industrial exhibitions which have been held in tho United States during tho present year attracted attention in many foreign countries where the announcement of those enterprises hud been made public through io toreiirn tigenetea of this Government. Tho Industrial exhibition at Hasten and the South ern exposition at Louisville wero largely at tended by tbe exhibitors of foreign countries, notwithstanding tho absence of any profes sional character of these undertakings. The Centennial Fxhibitlu to bo bold next year at New Orleans iu commemoration of the centenary of the first shipment of cotton from a port of tho Cnited Slates bids fair to meet with gratifying success. I'nder the act or Congress of the loth of February, de claring the exposition to be national and in ternational in character, all foreign govern ments with which tho I'nited States maintain relations have been Invited to participate. The promoters of this important undrriaiving have already received assurances of llio lively interest which it has excited abroad. 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Tho report of tho Commissioners District of Columbia is herewith transmitted. I ask for it your careful nttcnlion, especially tor those portions which relate to assess ments, arrears of taxes and water supply. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. der tho act of January III, 1hj:i, entitled "an act to regulate and improve the civil service of the States." Knterod promptly upon tho discharge of those duties, u ner.es of rules framed in accordance with the spirit of statu to was approved and promulgated by tbo Presi dent. In some particulars wherein they seemed de fective these rules were subsequently amend ed. It will bo perceived that they dis countenance any political or n liirimis tests for admis-dou to the oillces of the public ser vice to which the stututu relates. The act Is limited iu its original application to tho elas-dilod clerkships in thu several i xecu tivo departments at Washington (numbering about 5.tiHi) and to similar positions in cus toms districts and postollices where us many as lllty persons uro employed. A classifica tion of these positions antilogous to that existing tn tho Washington offices was duly made before, tho law went into effect. Kleven customs districts and twenty-three post ollices wore thus brought under the immedi ate operation of the statute. The annual report of the Civil Service Commission, which will soon bo submitted to Congress, will doubtless alford the means of a more definite judgment than ;i am now prepared to ex press as to tho merits of the new system. 1 am persuaded that Its effects have thus Tar proved beneficial and its practical methods appear to be adequate for the ends propped, and there have been no serious difficulties In carrying them into effect. Since tho Ititli of July last no person, so far ns I am aware, has been appointed to the public service iu tho classified portions thereof at any of ttie de partments or at any of the post-offices or cus toms districts above named, except those cer tified by the commission to bo t lie most com petent on tho basis; of tho examinations held In conformation of tho rule. THE PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION. At tho tlmo when tho present Kxeeutlvo en tered his ollice his doatb, removal, resignation or inability to discharge bis duties would haver left tbo Government without a constitutional head. It is possible, of course, that a similar contingency may again arise unless the wis dom of Congress shall provide against Its recurrence. Tbo Senato at Its last session, after full consideration, passed an act relating to this subject, which will now, 1 trust, commend itself to tbe ap proval of both bouses of Congress. Tho clause of the Constitution upon which must depend any law regulating tbo Presidential succes sion presents also for solution other questions of paramount importance These questions relaio to the proper interpretation of the phrase "Inability to discbarge the powers and duties of said otltco." Our organic law provid ing that, when tho President shall suffer from such inability, the Presidential otlice shall devolve upon the Vice President, who must him-telf, under like ciroumstnnees, give place to such otfleer as CougrcHS may by law appoint to act as President. I need not hero sot forth numerous and Interesting Inquiries which are suggested by these words of tho constitution. They were fully Stated In my first communication to Congress and have since been tho subject of frequent delibera tions In that body. It Is greatly to be hoped that theso momentous questions will And speedy solution, lest emergencies may arise when longer delay will be impossible and any determination, albeit the wisest may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm.
