The first session of the 48th Congress be gan in Washington at noon on Monday.— Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, the nominee of the Democratic caucus, was elect ed speaker. His opponent was the late speaker Keifcr, of Ohio, who claimed a vin dication at the hands of his Republican col leagues, and received it, such ns it was, grudg ingly. The vote in the Democratic caucus, on Saturday, was for Carlisle 10G, for Ran dall 52, for Cox 30. The Maryland delega tion in caucus voted solidly for Randall, but in tlie House their votes were cast for Car lisle. The selection of Speaker had been made to binge almost entirely upon the tariff question, and the most direful predictions were mude that the selection of Mr. Carlisle to preside over the House would mean the inauguration of another sectional contest in politics, in which a solid North would be arrayed against a solid South. Happily the conservative and judicious utterances of Mr. Carlisle, upon tak ing the chair, were such as to reassure the business interests of the country Hun Hie Democratic majority in Congress do not intend to revolutionize the tariff system, A reform in the tariff is needed in order that the burdens of government may be more lightly fell and labor receive its due reward. Mr. Carlisle’s speech is the key-note of Democratic legislation a) tho present session and will li inis 1 1 the bugaboo with which some Republican journals have been and are still endeavoring im frighten the people. He de clares himself opposed to "sudden and radi cal changes” in the tariff, hut is in favor of a judicious reform of existing tariff laws. He adds; “What the country has aright to expect is strict economy in the administration of every department of the government, just and equal taxation for public purposes, a faithful observance of the limitations of the construc tion, and a scrupulous regard for tlie rights and interests of the great body of the people, in order that they may be protected, as far as Congress has power to protect them, against encroachments from every direction. What ever can bo done under the circumstances surrounding us to meet this expectation ought to lie done, in my judgment.” Upon this sound platform the Democrats in Congress need not hesitate to stand. Mr. Carlisle's support was not conlined to any one section, showing the wide spread desire for a more equitable adjustment of the tariff laws. A tariff system that extorts $130,000,- 000 more from Hie people than is necessary to carry on the government and provide for the payment of the national debt is radically wrong It leads to extravagance, corruption and a wasteful disbursement of Hie public funds. To correct tins evil and to restore Hie general government to the rule of economy in Hie public service is one of the objects which Mr. Carlisle and ids Democratic asso ciates iu Congress linve in view, i.ud in car rying it out they will have Hie support of a large majority of the American people. The President's Message. President Arthur’s message was read to both houses of Congress on Tuesday after noon. It is a clear, comprehensive, business like document, free from the clap trap and appeals to popular prejudice which have marred Hie messages of so many of ids Repub lican predecessors. It opens with a reference to our peaceful relations witli foreign governments, which is followed by suggestions in regard to fish eries. It calls for a revision of the laws on Pauper immigration, and says that while American swine products are now admitted without restriction Into France, they arc excluded from Germany. Tho President does not favor tho rapid ex tinguishment of the national debt, which he says is only attainable by excessive taxation. The annual receipts of the government, the President says, have been cut down fifty or sixty million dollars annually. While still further reductions may be wisely made the President does not advise the adoption of any measures for large diminution of the national revenues. He does not consider that the existing tarifl laws have been suffi ciently tried to justify any radical revision or sweeping modification of them. He re commends that the surplus revenue be ap plied to restoring the navy. To prevent Hie threatened contraction of national bank currency by the calling in hy the government of the bonds given to secure their circulation, he recommends the issuing of new bonds having many years to run, or the enactment of a law repealing the tax on circulation and permitting Hie banks to issue notes for an amout equal to 90 per cent, of the market value of their deposited bonds. The message recam mends Hint provision shall tie made for Hie purchase hy the treasury of trade dollars at a small percentage above the market price of silver. The Secretary of the Treasury, on Hie other hand, recom mends that the government buy them dollar for dollar and convert them into standard dol lars. There is peace with Hie Indians. The necessity of more adequate means for defend ing odr coast line is adverted to and sugges tions made to carry out the measures pro posed. The message recommends that free delivery of letters be reduced to Jne cent, and does not favo. government control of the telegraphs. The President docs not think any real pro gress lias been made towards extirpating polygamy in Utah, and recommends that Congress lake entire political control of Hie territory. Reference is made to Hie prevalence of pleuro-pucumonia and other diseases of cat tle and that a committee of a convention of persons interested iu tho cattle trade would invite the co-operation of Congress in inves tigating the causes, prevention and cure of these diseases. The President attributes the severe fresh ets of the past year to Hie removal of lim ber from the sources of streams. The atten tion of Congress is called to the necessity of withdrawfjng from Hie public sale certain for est lands belonging to Hie United Slates. Tho presidential succession and the special veto power are also touched upon, the mes sage closing with a reference to civil rights, the President assuring- Congress Hint any leg islation to lawfully supplement the guaran tees which the constitution affords of equal rights of citizenship will receive Ids approval. —lt is said that a bill will be introduced into the next Legislature to authorize the County Commissioners to divide Abingdon district into two voting precincts, of which one voting place shall be at MagnqUa- The proposition is one that should be favorably received. Under the present arrangement a number of voters have to travel 80 miles and more in going to and returning home from the polls at Abingdon. The (’aimers’ Meeting To-Morrow. 1 We Imve no doubt the cnnning interests of the county will be well represented at the meeting to be held in liel Air tomorrow (Saturday.) Delegations from adjoining enmi ties and Baltimore city are also expected to be present. The meeting will discuss topics of interests to packers, prominent among which will be the cause of the present de pression in the trade and the remedy. It is to be hoped there will be hearty co operation between the representatives of the trade from all sections, and that good to the canning interests of the State may result from the meeting. It is claimed that the low prices are not caused by over-production, but from forced sales by packers to meet their can-notes, &c. One remedy proposed is the formation of a strong syndicate, with capital sufficient to stand between the weak packer and his credi tor, and thereby prevent sales at prices below cost. It is estimated that 200,000 cases of goods are hypothecated for advances made upon them. If these could be controlled by the syndicate it is thought prices would rise. It costs about 90 cents to pack a dozen cans and their market value is now only about 80 cents. The large puckers have therefore a direct interest in withdrawing weak goods from the market, to euchance the value of the goods they have on hand. The plan pro posed is for the needy packer to give his note to the syndicate, for an advance upon his goods; tin; latter to be stored in a ware house, the packer who gives the note insur ing his goods and delivering his warehouse receipts to the agent of the syndicate, with the privilege of naming the lowest selling price; that the syndicate fix upon some cen tral public place for trade sales of all classes of goods to make a general market price, the goods offered to be sold absolutely, or j till licly withdrawn, sales free to all, under pro per conditions; all goods to he sold hy sam ple, opened just previous to sale, and rated as to grade of quality by the inspector of the syndicate, and further subject to public ex amination during sales, and a guarantee from the packer that all goods are as sample. In other words it is proposed that a syndi cate of Maryland capitalists shall otter to packers the same advantages that are ottered by large dealers in canned goods outside the Slate. In connection with this it is proposed to build a number of warehouses, at central points, in which the goods can be stored, either with or without their hypothecation, so that, if properly graded, the storage corti cate* may be sold as certificates of grain in the elevators are sold, —The Havre de Grace UepuUicun is in favor of making the city of Havre de Grace a separate collection district of the county, with a representative in the board of County Commissioners The number of County Commissioners is arbitrary, and without re ference to the manner in which the county may be divided into districts. Each member of the board is a Commissioner for the whole county and not for the particular election district in which he may reside. There is nothing in the law, as it stands now, to pre vent the election of one or all of the Com missioners from Havre de Grace or from any other district. It would bo inexpedient and inadvisablefwc think, toincicasc the number of County Commissioners. It might, how ever, facilitate the collection of taxes to make the city of Havre de Grace a separate collec tion district. Tub Youth’s Companion.—As a source of profitable entertainment for the family, no pa per exceeds in interest the Youth's Companion. Its list of writers embraces the best names in periodical literature, and it is evidently the aim of its editors to secure not only the best writers, but the best articles from their liens. It is a remarkable thing for a single paper to obtain such a succession of- lively and brilliant stories and illustrated articles. While the Companion is in the main a story paper, the mental, moral and religious training of young people is an end kept steadily in view. Its articles on current topics arc written by the most qualified pens, and present, in a clear, vivid, direct way, fundamental facts of home and foreign politics, amlall public questions. Itsorignai anecdotes of public men are invaluable in their inlluencc in stimulating right ambition and a high purpose in life.

Griffith, President of the Maryland Piisouers’ Aid Society, ou Monday made a visit of inspection to tbe Harford county Almshouse and Jail. He found at the Almshouse 34 in mates, of whom 5 were insane or partially so, and sof them children. He found everything clean and neat, the sanitary condition of Hie building good, and the poor of the county well cared for. Between 400 and 500 tramps are fed and lodged at the Almshouse in the course of a year. They are given a night’s shel ter and supper, but to secure u breakfast arc required to cut a certain quantity of wood. Many of them, rather than do this, leave with out their breakfast. Mr. Griffith thinks that the only way lo get rid of this class is to make them work for benefits received. Mr. Griffith, upon learning the cost of maintaining the in stitution, thought it was managed in a very economical manner. Mr. Elijah Kirk is the overseer, ami Mrs. Kirk the matron. Mr. Griffith said he found the Jail in fair con dition, the walls whitewashed and the fioors generally clean. The sanitary condition was us good us could he expected under the present circumstances. He suggested tiiat each pris oner should be compelled to keep his cell scru pulously clean and neat. He considered the Jail badly constructed, damp, gloomy, unhealthy and unsafe. He thought that a new Jail differently constructed, is needed, and that from $14,000 to $15,000, with the material in the old jail, would be amply suffi cient to erect a suitable building. He found 12 prisoners in the jail, a number of whom were young men, awaiting sentence or trial. Mr. Griffith has just returned from an extend ed tour through the Southern States, where he visited the penitentiaries, jails and almshouses, with the view of interesting to a greater degree the people of the South in the sanitary manage ment of prisons and the moral training of the inmates. Mr. Griffith gleaned much valuable information that will be useful to him in his work in Maryland. He was also evidently suc cessful in awakening a deeper interest through out the South in the matter of prison reform. He reports the condition of Hie colored people of the Soutli as good as could be expected under Hie circumstances. Many of them are acquiring property, and their schools are turning out many cultured and useful citizens. —J. M.

Heed, In Darlington, was entered by burglars, after 12- o’clock on Wednesday night of last week, and the safe blown open and robbed. Two men aie believed to have been engaged in the transaction. Entrance was ef fected by bursting off li:e bolt of the front win dow shatter. They then drilled a small hole in the safe door, just below the knob, tilled the bole with powder and blew open the safe, com pletely wrecking it. Traces of blood were found on the Door near by, showing that one of the thieves must have been hurt by the ex plosion. They obtained from the safe about SSO in money belonging to Mr. Reed. The postofllce is kept in the store, Dr. 11. C. White ford being the postmaster, and the stamps were also kept in the safe. They removed the post office money and stamp drawers, and carried them across the road, into a field, where they rilled them, securing about $l2O worth of post age stamps and a small quantity of change, throwing the drawers away. Before they left they refreshed themselves with bread and butter, and carried away all the silk handkerchiefs out of the show window, all the best coats, except one, 3 razors,2 pistols, several pairs of scissors, cigar eases, combs, brushes, (fee. They did not touch any of the mail matter, us far us could be leaned. The drop box was full of letters ami pennies dropped in to pay postage, but was not disturbed. They eanied Mr. Heed’s pocket book to the door and carefully examined it leaving all the papers, checks, &c. t which they could not use. A large hammer, screw driver, chisel and brace used were taken from Mr. John Sheridan’s blacksmith shop, in the neighbor hood. Willi Hie screw driver they removed the keeper from tlie front door and made their exit ii t hat way, first extinguishing a lamp and a can dle they had used. Their movements were ap parently very deliberate, as they evidently stop ped in the field long enough to replace their foiled stockings with clean ones taken from the store. The explosion was beard by Mrs. Heed, whose bed room is over I lie back building in the rear of the store room. She thought a lamp had ex ploded, and finding that burning, looked out of the windows front and rear, but hearing nothing to alarm her went to sleep again. Miss Janie Ferguson, a guest at Mrs. Annie E. Wilson’s, 250 yards from the store, also heard the noise, at 3. A. M. No clue was left to Indicate in which direction the nu n went. They were no doubt professionals. About 12 o’clock, Messrs, Robert E. Prlgg and Jos. K. Ely, returning home, met two men in the street, who concealed their faces and passed by without speaking.— Those are believed to have been the burglars Special Postoflice Agent Henderson, who hos been making enquiries, on Friday morning caused the arrest of a peddler, at Union depot, but Mr. Henderson became satisfied lie had nothing to do with the robbery and released him.

The first trial in court under the Harford comity local option law began on Tuesday. It was the ease of Joseph Maekin, indicted for sell ing a pint of whisky to John F. Evans, in Havre de Grace.

Stump, William Young and lloplins, first made a general de murrer to the indictment.. Tic demurrer was argued by Col. Stump, who said that the indictment should have alleged and should have shown alllrmutlvely that the* law had been adopted by the people, othsrwise it mus fail; it being a well-established principle in law that what is necessary to be proved un der in indictment must first be alleged therein. Tje Slate was represented by State’s Attor ney Maynadier, Win. M. Marine, Esq., and Hon. Henry VV. Archer, the latter making Hie argu ment before the court to set aside the demur red Mr. Archer argued that it was not necessary to illcge in the indictment the adoption of the lav by the people; that ihcTtli section absolute ly prohibited the sale of liquor in Harford county, without any condition whatever, and HivAJlie act easts the burden of proof upon the defence to show that it hud not been adopted. Judge Watters held the matter under advise ii)i‘iit morning, when lie over ruled umsr. He Mild that Chapter W 2 of the General Assembly of Maryland is an act toenabte the qualified voters of Harford county to determine whether or not intoxicat ing liquors shall lie sold in said county. The first thive sections prescribe the manlier in which the question is to lie submitted and tin; result ascertained. The remaining sections are intended to carry into effect the result ascertain ed in accordance with Hie preceding sections. Whet her these auctions are or are not the law in Harford county depends upon the contingency mentioned in the preceding sections. Being ii public local law, it is not necessary lo set it forth at length in the indictment, neither is it neces sary to set forth all Hie facts which are conditions precedent lo the law taking effect. If Hie sec tions referred to are the law as to this county, tlien the acts charged are clearly against their provisions. The indictment stating that the act alleged was against the statute, &c., was sufficient. Exceptions were filed to the overruling of the demurrer and a special demurrer was also over ruled. Special pleas, ten in number, were? then offer ed by the defence. The first plea avers that it was not a general election at which the law was voted upon; that no return was made by the Judges of any vote as provided iu the net ; that no proclamation was made of the result of said election by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of said Harford coun ty, as required by the act. The second plea stales that no general elec tioi was held at the time and in I lie manner re quired by the act. The third plea was ruled out on demurrer. The fourth plea is that no return was made by the Judges of election to Hie Clerk of the Cnouit Court of Harford county, as provided in said act. The fifth plea was that, no proclamation was made by the Clerk of Hie Circuit Court of Har ford county. 'Hie sixth tiiat there is no such officer known to he law us the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Ha ford County. The seventh, t hat the traverser lias before bem convicted of the same offence. The eighth out on demurrer. The ninth was tiiat the act is not a public local law of Harford county. The tenth, not guilty. Argument for the pleas was mode by Mr. Young and against them by Mr. Archer. Judge Walters overruled the demurrer as to the Ist, 2d, 4th and sth pleas, and sustained it as to the remainder. The following jurymen were then empunnel led lo try the ease : I. Newton Scarborough, Alonzo Jarrctt, Cor bin M. Grafton, Wii. I). Osborn, Win. H. Car roll, Michael J. Wheeler, Cyrus A. Courtney, Win. Ayres, H. Stump Smith, Charles Steele, CliaHVs Myer and Daniel Smith. Cupt. A. Lingan Jarrctt, Clerk of Court, his deputy, Mr.J. H. Ely, and Mr. Geo. H. Cal rues, lute Clerk lo ihe County Commissioners, testifi ed for the Slate that Ihe returns had been made to the Clerk’s office, the proclamation made, and tiiat the returns were signed by the Chief Judges in the several precincts. Court then ad journed until I hursday. On Thursday morning, when court reassem bled, Mr. John T. Spicer testified that lie signed the returns of the election with the other judges. The prosecuting witness was John F. Evans, who testified that Maekin sells tobacco, segars and drinks, opposite the freight depot, Havre de Grace. In October, 1882, Hie witness went into Macklu’s place and asked lor whisky. Maekin told him he did not sell whisky but sold giuger. Witness put an empty pint bottle on a table in Markin’s parlor and laid half a dollar beside it. He then walked out into Hie yard. When he returned the bottle was filled ami he put it in ids pocket. Mr. Marine, for the State, asked the witness whether or not he knew Maekin was in Hie habit of selling “ginger” then?. The question was objected to by Ihe defence. The Court field that the Stale could prove that what Maekin sold us ginger was really whisky. Mr. Marine—l want to prove that this house is a standing nuisance in the city of Havre de Grace, and that intoxicating liquors are sold openly, the same as if allowed by law. Mr. Archer said that the testimony of the witness disclosed an attempt of the traverser to evade the law by selling whisky under the name of ginger. The testimony, he thought, was ad missablo for the purpose of showing that “gin ger” Is whisky. Mr. Young for the defence said that this was an attempt to get in the declarations of others as evidence, which is not evidence. Judge Watters, to w itness. “What was the article you got in that bottle, whisky or gin ger?” The witness could not say it was all whisky ; or all giuger, but there was whisky in it. Judge Watters.—“What sized bottle was it ?” Ans.—“A pint bottle.” Judge Watters.—“You would not have given half a dollar for a pint of ginger, would you ?” | The witness said he would not, but If lie could ! not get a whole bottle cf whisky for half a dollar he would get half a bottle. Cross-examined by defence.—lt was an intoxi cating drink, but could not tell whet tier Hie | ginger was mixed with whisky or with apple brandy. No evidence was offered for the defence. 'The opening argument for Hie State was made by Mr. Marlin?. ID? was followed by Messrs. Hopkins and Wm. Young for the defence, and Hon. Henry W. Archer for Ihe State. The jury remained out about fifteen minutes and brought in a verdict of “guilty.” The case will proba bly be appealed. cou it r fhoceehi \ as.

Wm. O’Neill, Esq., died on Thursday, October istli, 1883. in the thirty-fifth year of her ago. The de ceased was a native of Havre do Grace, and had lived here all her life, and was a general favorite with everybody, and her early death is deeply re gretted by all. in the family circle, where her absence makes so painful a void, she was over the kind, loving daughter, affectionate sister and de voted wife; yielding and unselfish indisposition. In the community, “’Gusta” was a general fa vorite ; her frank and cordial manners wore sure to win her friends, and her genial smile of wel come can never be forgotten by those who have felt the warmth of its glow. In works of charity she was over foremost, and the poor have lost a good friend. In the full bloom of womanhood, amidst the lamentations of loved ones, and sur rounded by all that makes life pleasant and de sirable, “She passed through Glory’s morning gate,” Her funeral took place on Sunday afternoon following, from St. John’s P. E. Church, of which she had long boon a member. The building was packed to its uimost capacity by her many rela tives and friends. The Rev. 11. Baldwin Dean officiated, delivering u most interesting and touching sermon, eulogistic of the deceased. The burial casket, which wasa handsome, velvet cov ered one, contained a plate, bearing this inscrip tion : Augusta Dallas O'Neill, Born Nov. 3, 1845, Died Oct. 18,1883, Beautiful 1 lowers covered thoensket, and oneof the designs was a handsome pillow containing the single word. “Gusta,” wrought by loving hands.

The record ot this Company Is ihe best evidence of its strength. Tiie great fire of Chicago demonstrated the fact that largo companies doing an extended business should make provision for Ihe protection of out side policy-holders. The CONTINENTAL was the first and largest company to work under the New York Safety Fund Law, which is recognized as the greatest safeguard ever made for the safety of policy holders. THE CONTIN ENTA L placed one mil lion two hundred Thousand Dollars in Govern ment bonds in tin hands of the Now York State officials, which fund cannot lie touched to pay the loss of any gnat fire. New York may burn to morrow night, but a farmer holding a Continent al policy knows that ids policy in as good for its amount ns if the Company had not lost a dollar. Tim CONTI N ENTA L does business from Maine to California, and pays over $1,800,000 annually in fire losses. Its capital is One Million Dollars and assets over $4,450,000. The loss in Westmins ter, over $4,000, was paid in full, THIRTY HOURS after the lire, and although almost national in its extent and business, Is managed in Maryland by well-known Marylanders. Having accepted this Agency, I wish every one to Investigate its advantages. No one under standing the CONTINENTAL would accept any other policy at the same rate. The rates are us low as those charged by any other first-class com pany. I will be in Bel Air every Monday, and will gladly give any needed information. WM P. TRIMBLE, dc?e7* P.O.
