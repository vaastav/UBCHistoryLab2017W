LOCAL NEWS. Suit.?Ia tho U. S. Supreme Court, yesterday, Downham et al. vs. The City of Alexan dria. In this case the oity of Alexandria imposed a tax ot $200 on all agents, &c., "in ale and beer by the cask, not manufactured in the oity,but brought there lor sale." The ts.x was resis-ted on the ground that it was uuc institutional, iu that it was a tux ou onuitneice, and discriminated in lavor ot local manufacturers. The oourt below sustained the tax, and the case was brought up, where it was now held that the questions raised by counsel were not raised by the record. The record did not show that the tax was imposod on manufacturers eat of the State, but on those simply without the city. No question was raised by the record, therefore, whioh oould be considered under the twonty-fitth section of the judiciary act. The writ of error was dismissed. Mr. Justico Field delivered the opinion. Steamboats.?The Secretary of the Treas ury has jast issued a circular to local inspectors of steamboats, directing them to enforce in the strictest manner compliance with the act of Coogress, requiring that suitable and safe pro vison be nude throughout each vessel (o guard against Jo^s or danger by lire. The sco rctary aids : liAs the see son is at hand when atoves will he rrquired lor the comtort uf passengers on board steamboats in your district, you are hereby directed to examine all steamboats and nquira the stores to be securely fastened to the floor, or other fixed support, in suoli manner as to prevtnt them Irom over turning or Irom falling to pieces in the evc-Gt of the boar etreeniog or of tbe occurrence of :t heavy jar." Counterfeit Monet?Notwithstanding the recent arrest of persons in New York, charged with selling counterfeit money, the business is still carried on there. A friend at Linden Station, Fauquier county, has scot us a copy of one of the. circulars of the fellows engaged in this swindle, proposing to lurnish the parties to whom they are addressed with counterfeit monry. Some time ogo, we published this, or a similar circular. We presume that no body can possibly be entrapped by these scoundre's. These circulars are signed with different fictitious names.
