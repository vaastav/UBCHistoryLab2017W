Beaten iiy Tiu'oh.? On the night of tlu? 20th ult., at Huntington, Mr. R. H. Yowell, of the 7 \tnet news paper, was assaulted on the street by four or flvo murderous thugs and brutally beaten. The Times bud been making war on these toughs, and they took tbis cowardly met bod ot* revenge. They were all arrested and should be severely dealt with. Huntington has also had a sensa tion in the arraignment by Judge McUinnis, of the Criminal Court, of the editors and proprietors of the That* for contempt, their offense being a criticism of the action of the Court in the trial of certain parties charged with prize fighting. All were fined and in addition Mr. "S ow- , ell was sent to jail, but was promptly I released by .1 udge Harvey, of the Circuit Court, on a writ of habeas | corpus. From the account of the proceedings given in the Times, Judge McGinnls seems to have had au exalted opinion of his own dig nity, and used the power of his Court to inflict punishment the jus tice of which may well be ques tioned. Extka Session.? Some of our State exchanges are urging the (?ov ernor to call an extra session of the Legislature this winter to re-arrange the judicial circuits and to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for the expenses of the State govern, ment, which the Legislature, at its last session, ignorantly or wilfully failed to make. The Legislature with a false idea of economy and in its desire to make a little cheap po litical capital, failed to perform a plain duty imposed upon it by law that is to provide the means noces Bary for the proper conduct of the various departments of the State government. This neglect of duty will greatly embarrass the executive department of the government, and may necessitate the heavy expense of an oxtra session, though it is not probable that the Governor will con vene the Legislature if there bo any possible way by which an extra ses sion can be avoided. The President's message, sent to Congress on Tuesday, deals largely with our relations with foreign coun tries, and as to the pending struggle of the Cubans for national independ ence, he urges the strictest neutrality on the part of this government, lie deals ably and at length with the financial question, and urges the re tirenient of the greenback notes.? In dealing with this great question, the President is clear, strong and for cible and, whilst showing due defer ence to the opinions of those who seo in free coinage the remedy for existing evils, he has decided con victions the other way, which he does not hesitate to declare. The Turk.? -No where in the world's history do we read of a more formidable politico-military combi nation than thiit now arrayed against the Sultan by the six great Christfan powers of Europe to secure protec tion for the Christians in Asia Minor. Yet in the face of this mighty com bination, in comparison with which the armies of Sennacherib, Alexan der, Ctesar and Napoleon dwindle into insignificance, there is no apps. rent cessation in the horrible slaugh ter of the Armenian Christians l?y the merciless and barbarous Turks. (I en. Cox EY is said to bo very much elated over the fifty odd thou sand votes he received for Governor ol Ohio. As he and his friends counted on a very much larger vote, we take tbis exuberance of spirit on the part of the excentric statesman from Ohio to be nothing more than a whistling in the dark to keep the courage up. It is said, too, that Coxey proposes to start a paper next year to be called Sound Money , which will advocate the free coinage of silver. New Men. ? In the i> 1th Congress, which convened Monday, there will be 158 men who have never bad any experience in national legislation, and of this number 5)2 were never in a legislative body of any kind. The delegations from many of the West ern States are almost entirely new, many of the old and experienced members iu both parties having been dropped out in the elections last fall. There will also be quite a number of very young men in the new Congress. The Courier- Journal declares that, notwithstanding this is a Democratic administration, eight-tenths of all the best offices in the various depart ments at Washington are held by Republicans. Some of our Demo cratic exchanges argue that this state of things had much to do with roccnt Democratic reverses. "Turn the rascals out" was a campaign cry to which it seems the powers that bo have given but little attention. "The Bimetalist" is tho signifi cant name of a new weekly recently launched at Charleston, whose mis sion will be to advocate the free and unlimited coinage of both metals. ? Mr. S. X. Swimme will bo the edi tor in charge. Surely he will be able to keep the head of the ?? Bi metalist" above water. .Congress convened Monday.? Mr. Jteed was elected Speaker, re ceiving 23-1 votes to 95 for Crisp. A 

LAKUR crowd attended the game of" football at Charleston in Thanks giving day last week between the clubs from our State University and the Washington and Lee University at Ijexiugton. Excitement ran high and the game ftas played with great spirit. The West Virginia hoys were too large and heavy tor the Lexington team and w?>n easily by a score of -J* to S. The gate receipts, as we are informed, amounted to about $2,000, all ot which went to the winners. They, however, gave the Washington and Lee hoys which more than paid their ex pen-.es. This large sum so easily tuade will put the athletic club at Morgantown 011 a good footing. Mn. ('hah. II. Read, Jk., of Rich mond, hns been employed as the su peri n tending architect to he in charge ol" the new building* for the Union Theological Seminary, soon to be re- 1 moved from Hnmpden-Sidncy to Richmond. The work before Mr. Read is an important and extensive | one. I here will he fourteen build- 1 ings altogether, and they will proha hly cost $200,000 or more. He has already begun the preliminary work in t he preparation of his plans. Of the $125,000, mo far subscribed to ward the construction of the new buildings, the sum of $7.\000 was given by Messrs. \V. W. Npence, of Baltimore, and George W. Watts' of 1 >urham. N.

Col. \V,?. L?In,, Wlts chosen chairman in place of Wm, Mahone, deceased, Hnd was also chosen as the Virginia member of the Republican National Committee. The choice of Col.

Rocke feller, the multi-millionaire, was married at Now York on the 20th ult., to Harold F. McCornoick, son of | Cyrus McCormick, the well-known reaper-king, m of Chicago. There were millions in it. Recent estimates put John I). Rockefeller's wealth at $200,000, 000. He is said to have given away $20, 000,000 ill charities. If the above estimate be true, John I), could af- ! ford to give away double as much more and yet be very far from the poor house. Miss Daisy Gorman, daughter of!
