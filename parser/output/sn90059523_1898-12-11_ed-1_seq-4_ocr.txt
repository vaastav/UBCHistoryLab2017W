The board of education of Chicag-o are contemplating the establishment of a commercial school in the down town district of that city. The Tribune an tagonizes the proposition as unwise and inexpedient. In this view it has the support of a number of well known citizens of Chicago, both in business and professional lines. It is not so much distinctly commer cial schools that are required, as in struction in all the higher grade schools upon the general subject of the commercial history of the world. The Globe has recently given some at tention to this subject; and there has appeared from time to time in these columns an expression of opinion as to what is really needed In this par ticular line of education. There is, undoubtedly, no better school for a business training and busi ness life than the practical school of the warehouse, the levee, the shipping dock, the counting house and the like. The boy of sixteen, for instance, who ' begins life in any one of these depart ments of trade and commerce, starts j with an advantage in his favor, provid- ! ed he Is possessed of the true business ] Instinct. The most successful men, and j those who have acquired wealth and ! distinction from these pursuits, are those who began at the bottom and whose acuteness of intellect, operating ln harmony with the gradual develop ment of inherent taste for business, led them, step by step, into the position of masters of their particular occupation. There are many so-called commercial schools in the larger cities which teach rudimentary and elementary knowl in regard to the routine of a business office or a bank, such as pen manship, bookkeeping, and, in later years, stenography and typewriting. These embrace a preparatory course for mere clerical work, and the per centage is very small indeed among the young men who start out on these lines of those who go much beyond the mere plodding, machinelike occu pation. It is oftener the boy who en ter. ! the establishment to do errands, to sweep out the store and to do gen eral hustling which affords a broader M.a of what the business consists who really becomes the manager and pro prietor. But a line of education from text in the schools on the history of commerce, the processes of its develop ment, the sources whence the world is supplied by special products and com modities, the methods of handling them, the cost of their production or their creation, the system by which profits are arrived at in the progress i of trade, the methods and costs of transportation from one part of the world to another, and many other kindred lines of investigation and in struction are what are most essential to almost every child and youth in at tendance at the public schools in this extraordinary period of commercial activity. It is by bringing to the notice of the young and by creating pictures for their imagination to enlarge upon that oftentimes the first discovery of a par ticular talent or tendency in a direc tion which may lead to a proper start In life is made. It is beyond doubt thai the imagination plays a most im portant part in revealing the bent of B youthful mind. A text book which Bhall present the whole subject in a manner that shall interest instead of weary the young reader might appro priately be added to other books of Instruction in every public school in the land. The young see about them things ma terial. Nature is overhead and round about them; they see great cities and; railway lines and mighty steamships! nm; all manner of factories, and they j tl ke it all in in a matter of fact way ' Without realizing upon what all this ! growth and construction has been has- ! <-d. They are not taught to go down I deep into the foundations and explore] th. sources whence these things have j eprung, whereas the basis of all is found : to exist in original development of ma- | terial nature, the utilization of all her products, the contribution of one ma terial toward the development of the other, the necessity for industry and the work of the hands for the accom plishment of it all and the rewards in the form of accumulations of wealth Which rear the city and supply the means for the creation of the home and the varying degrees of comfort and luxury and culture which the in dividual is ever seeking after as he makes his journey tin.,ugh this life. It is due to them that a better un derstanding and a deeper appreciation, first, of that which exists, and, sec ond, of that whence it comes, that a broader education upon this Important subject should be provided. A National Demscrattc Club. New York city will have a club in Which the national Democracy can feel a positive pride, when the plans of tbe Hon. Perry Belmont are fully ma tured. Mr. Belmont succeeds ex-Gov. ItoeweU P. Flower as the president of tin- Democratic club. He is fortunate in possessing the confidence of Demo crats of every shade of opinion, from the humblest district worker to the teamed counselor and the campaign i : contributor. Tammany hall voiced this j <, feeling when Richard Croker urged ! him to assume the duties of the presi- i dency. Mr. Belmont was never a mem- j ber of Tammany, a fact that has not ; ; escaped the attention of the deserving. ; i Henceforth the Democratic club will ; be open to Democrats of every state in ! i the Union. It will be "nationalized," j as it were, and the Democrats of Mm- j ncsota and the Northwest who are de- ' sirous of seeing their party broadened along national lines should welcome | this opportunity of encouraging so ex cellent an idea. It is a hopeful sign when a gentleman of Mr. Belmont's ; education, public achievements and Bagactty steps boldly forward prepared to accept his share of the labor of re building the party. A Prediction and a Warning. A striking prediction was made a few days ago in New York by a clergyman familiar with the subject that this nation was destined at some day not far remote to pass through the crisis of a race war in the South. In making this prediction, however, he at tributed the lesponsibility for such an j issue less to the people of the South than to the politicians of the North, who persist in inspiring certain lead ers in the South to the manipulation of the negro for selfish purposes. The speaker was the Rev. Henry Frank. "Perhaps the most poetic in justice ever imposed upon any people," he said, 'was the forced bestowal of the duties and privileges of citizenship upon the negro long before he was fit ted by training and experience to as sume such prerogatives." Here is an illustration of too precipi tate action on the part of the people stirred by an impulse at the period of a great crisis, which may well receive consideration at the present time. When the slaves were freed as the result of the war, politicians who thought they foresaw a permanent po litical advantage to be gained by the Republican party insisted upon con ferring the suffrage upon all males of the voting age who had previously been slaves. The history of the carpetbag government in the Fouth is not a whole some one for revival at the present time. It would not be referred to now except for the fact that a condition of things has developed in North and S-.uth Carolina which threatens much in the direction of growing inharmony between the white and black races and sterns to justify, in a measure, the forebodings indulged in by Mr. Frank above noted. At the time of the enactment of the fifteenth amendment the people of the North did not comprehend the condi tions prevailing in the old slave states. They follmved the impulse of senti ment and listened to the advocacy of the measure by unwise leaders and did not look into the future to meas ure the limits of the evil which they were conferring upon the representa tives of the black race under the mis apprehension that they were really performing an act of justice under our constitution. It is needless to say that the negro has never really enjoyed the privilege conferred, for the reason that, in many localities, the scheme was altogether Impracticable, in view of the sentiment which prevailed in opposition to gov ernment of masters by former slaves. It is to be hoped that the forebod ings of Mr. Frank may not be realized. A generation has passed since the suf frage was conferred upon the South ern slaves. The period has been mark ed by many acts of intolerance and of brutality. The wiser Republicans, like former Gov. Bullock, of Georgia, who has recently spoken on this subject, are in favor of permitting the South to work out its own destiny in con nection with the negro without further meddlesome interference by outsiders. Just at present the people of this country are exercised over a proposi tion to annex a group of islands whose people are our antipodes and whose population just about equals in num bers the negroes in the United States, but whose condition as to civilization is far inferior, as a whole, to that of the Southern black man at home. With the lesson ' above noted as to their inability to deal with the prob lem still unadjusted within their own family circle, it would hardly seem to be the part of wisdom on the part of the people of the United States to go forth to explore the equatorial lati tudes in search of good things to do when there remain so many things to do at home. A Death That Recalls a Tragedy. The death of William H. Robertson, of Westchester county. New York, re calls the tragedy resulting in the death of President James A. Garfield, Sept. 19. 1881, at Elberon. N. J., as the result of the shot fired from the pistol of Charles J. Guiteau in the waiting room of the Baltimore & Potomac railroad depot at Washington July 2 preceding. William H. Robertson, who had been county judge of Westchester county. New York, and state senator from his ! district, was an ardent supporter of j James G. Blame. He was an active ] Republican worker in the state, and 1 for many y.ars had been a delegate to the national conventions of his par ly. As a politician he was opposed to the dominancy of Senator Roscoe Conkling, whose hostility to Mr. Blame had its origin when Mr. Conkling and j Mr. Blame wore colleagues in the na- I tional house of representatives. In 1876, at Cincinnati, both Mr. Conk- I ling and Mr. Blame were candidates Cor the presidential nomination by tho con vention, which, in consequence of the i locking of horns of th^ representatives of these two men, resulted in the pre j cipitation of Rutherford B. Hayes into the presidential chair at the expense I of Samuel J. Tilden, who, as every fair i minded Republican today will admit, j was legally elected. In 1880. at Chicago, Mr. Blame's name was again before the convention, while Mr. Conkling, as a delegate from New Ycrk, led and held the famous 306 | votes which stood steadfastly by Gen. Grant throughout all the excitement and variations of the balloting process. Mr. Garfield, on the sixteenth ballot, received the nomination by the aid of the Blame forces, led in large part by Mr. Robertson. Mr. Garfield was elected, and his first selection as a cabinet officer was Mr. Blame for secretary of state. It be et me generally known that Mr. Blame's influence, operating upon the president, wculd secure the appointment of Judge Robertson as collector of the port of New York. Mr. Conkling's hostility to Judge Robertson was thoroughly understood and appreciated by both the president and Mr. Blame. Due warning was given that a contest would result over the confirmation. Mr. Conkling and Mr. Thomas C. PJatt, the present senator from New York, whose previous ap -1 THE ST. PAU£, 

GLOBE SUNDAY DECEMBER 11, 1893. piuval should in justice have been sought, were absolutely and almost in solently ignored. Buy the determina tion of Mr. Blame and the weakness of Mr. Garfield eventuated in the for warding of the name of Judge Robert son for that office to the senate. His confirmation was secured by the admin istration without regard to the usual dictum of senatorial courtesy, and Sen ators Conkling and Piatt forthwith tendered their resignations as senators from the state of New York to Gov. Alonzo B. Cornell. The two senators returned to Albany, believing that the legislature would vindicate them in the position they had taken. Judge Robertson, with all bis influence, antagonized their re election, and they were ignominiously defeated, and Elbridge G. Lapham and Warner Miller were sent to Washing ton in their places. Supplemental to this action Guiteau shot Garfleld, and Chester A. Arthur, of New York, the vice president, be came president of the United States. Judge Robertson served throughout his term as collector of the port and has continued to be active in Repub lican politics ever since. He has al ways been regarded, however, as the axis around which one of the most striking and tragical incidents in the political history of tho country has re volved. He was a genial man of pleas ing personality, a determined fighter, and, as usual in such cases, his ene mies were almost as numerous as his friends. His name must inevitably al ways remain attached to the great po litical incident mentioned. Dangers of Banquet Talk. The exhibition made of himself a few nights ago by the British minister to Franco, at a banquet in Paris, af fords another illustration of the din gers attending those diplomats who un dertake to express themselves upon delicate points of international Impor tance at the close of a modern banquet. It is customary for wise men who have anything tc say calculated to excite dis cussion to prepare themselves in ad vance, and not to trust to inspiration under the influence of champagne. A man usually feels pretty good about the time he rises to speak—that ls to say, if ha is capable at that stage of the proceeding of rising and speaking at all—and he does not always con sider how that which he says will ap pear in the morning newspaper, or how the sentiments he may have expressed shall strike the citizen who reads it critically at his breakfast table. Had Sir Edward Monson been a little more judicious in his utterances with respect to the relations between Great Britain and France, he would not now be com pelled to humiliate himself by an ex planation of his true meaning. Mr. Joseph H. Choate, of New York, in 1893, at a dinner of Irishmen who were celebrating St. Patrick's birthday, indulged in some remarks which at this late day have been resurrected to plague him. Mr. Choate, when he arose to speak that evening, was feeling good and merry; and as he enjoys fun greatly, he took occasion to rub it in to the Hibernians present on the supposition tliat they would all take it good-natur edly, as he intended it. There was pres ent on that occasion a large number of excellent Irishmen who enjoyed Mr. Chcate's speech as much as he at that time enjoyed it himself. But there were others who took what he said less kindly. "Five years and more have passed away," as the story teller would say, in shifting a scene, and Mr. Choate appears conspicuously before the coun try as a candidate for appointment to the honorable position of ambassador to the court of St. James. His twitting of the Irish gentlemen on the occasion referred to has, it seems, been re membered by them. They didn't relish the funny things he said so much as ho may have brought himself to think. On the contrary they appear to have been very much galled by them. The consequence is. protests in large num bers are dropping into President Mc- Kinley's mail basket against the se lection of Mr. Choate for this most im portant place, the protectants threaten ing all sorts of boycotting of Mr. Mc- Kinley and his party if Mr. Choate shall receive any honors at his hands. Here is another instance of the dan gers attending upon public men or men who have ambition to become public, in an official way, of talking on a full stomach under the influence of the ex hilarating wine. Californians, Old and Young. David Starr Jordan presents an idea in the Atlantic Monthly that carries a high flavor of originality. In arguing the peculiar value of "California and the Californians," he says: "The cli mate is especially kind to childhood and old age. Men live longer there, ar.d, if un wasted by dissipation, strength of body is better conserved. To children the conditions of life are particularly favorable. California Oould have no better advertisement at some world's fair than the visible demon stration of this fact. A series of meas urements of the children of Oakland has recently been taken, in the inter est of comparative child-study; and should the average of these for differ ent ag< s be worked into a series of moulds or statues for comparison with similar models from Eastern cities, the result would cause surprise. The chil dren in California, other things being equal, are larger, stronger and better formed than their Eastern cousins of the same age. "This advantage of development lasts unless cigarettes, late houis or grosser forms of dissipation come in to destroy it." In addition to the above unique prop osition President Jordan makes state ments in regard to the Californians, implying a comparison with other American citizens which is of doubtful Import. For example, he says that the "dcmir.ant note in the social develop ment of California is individualism, with all that this implies of good or evil. Man is man ln California. (What is he in Minnesota, Mr. Jor dan?) He exists for his own sake," continues tho writer, "not as a part of a social organism. He is in a sense superior to society." And then again we are assured that the Oalifornian forms his own opinion on matters of politics, religion and human life, and these views he expresses without re seive. His own head he carries under his own hat and whether this be silk or sombrero is a matter of his own choosing. The dictates of church and party have no binding force on him. He does not confine his views to ab stractions. He has his own opinions of individual men and women. If need b? he will analyze the character, mo tives and actions of his neighbor in a way which will horrify the traveler who has grown up in the shade of a libel lav,-. It is a little difficult to tell from the inferences just where the rest of us "are at" in Mr. Jordan's mind. Think of It! What a woeful thing it would be if Senator William E. Chandler, of New Hampshire. should hap pen to be turned down by Henry W. Blair. There are suggestions of this in the eastern horizon. Of course, the country has had about as much as it can stand of both these gentlemen. But it is to be hoped that Mr. Blair, With his national educational bill, will never be resurrected. Chandler is bad enough on account of his eccentricities, but nothing like as complete a hum bug as Blair always was and never can escape being. Chandler has al ways been possessed of a certain amount of brain; Blair was never ac credited with the possession of any. So far as wind power is concerned Chandler could not hold a oandle to Eiair, but when it came to pointedness of expression Chandler was always a master of sarcasm and had no equal in the senate except when he ran up against men like Conkling and lngalls. But Mr. Chandler did not have as much of an opportunity to display this pow er against either of these men, inas much as he toddled Into the senate just about the time they were traveling out. It would really be a pity to have Mr. Chandler removed from the sen ate. He has been an ornament as well as a freak. There ought always to be attractions maintained in a national museum of this sort, and nobody could suggest a more delightful attraction than Mr. Chandler, particularly when he gets his nose up against some mem bers of his own party, which he fre quently does. The First Attempt. Our first experience in garrisoning our oceanic possessions is not alto gether reassuring even to the most san guine of the "duty and destiny" men. That the First New York regiment, sent under command of a We.^it Point graduate to garrison Honolulu, should have to be ordered back because of the increasing sickness among the men throws some suspicion on the "salu brity of the Hawaiian climate." Surely the regiment had no undue hardships to undergo; they didn't have to swelter in trenches, flght on short rations, or get along without medical supplies. Yet the dispatches which have come within the last ten days show that the men are completely de moralized by disease. On Nov. 14 there were 162 } atients in the hospital, sixty three of whom were suffering from typhoid fever. The assurances from the war depart ment that camps have been moved to high ground and sanitary precautions taken oall forth the query as to wny, if such measures would have prevented sickness, they were not adopted sooner. In view of the fact-smothering proceed ings of the "investigating" committee we wonder, too, whether that which bas occurred in Hawaii and in this country will not soon occur ln the Philippines and in Cuba. If the Commercial club is a good judge of its own interest —and we be lieve it is—there will be only one can didate for the presidency who will re ceive recognition at this week's annual election. Col. Conde Hamlin has prov ed a model president. He is wedded to the welfare of the club, and that means St. Paul. Where would the Saintly city have been on several oo casions during the past year had it not been for this public-spirited club? Re-elect Mr. Hamlin, gentlemen, and let the club continue to broaden its sphere of activity. There is hard work ahead for St. Paul, if it hopes to wear the laurels it has won. Intelligence, activity, ingenuity, eternal hustle are qualifications absolutely requisite for the chief executive of the club during the coming year. We predict Mr. Ham lin's re-election. The Twin City Rapid Transit com pany would perform a service for which the public would be grateful if it would designate by signs those cars v. hich run around the union depot loop. To the uninitiated the problem of selecting that car which will take one to the depot is extremely vexing, and, as there appears to be no way to dis tinguish those that do not from those tbat do make the circuit of the loop, the ignorant, though innocent, traveler is obliged to take chances. Each loop car should be as plainly marked as those which go to- any other section of the city, and tt would be an easy matter for the company to do it. Why does the flour combine have so much trouble to stick? The lake beats now on the way to Buffalo are "cutting some ice." Dear Japan, we need the money, but our missionaries want a new browsing ground. You see it's this way: Gen. Miles doesn't want Gen. Alger in his army, and vice versa. Mr. Kenyon has expressed the opin ion that January will be a great deal colder than December. The flght between the Mad Mullah and the Nawab of Dir very appro priately took place in Swat valley. Ephraim Keigwin, the Jeffersonville, Ind., parson who wedded 9,000 couples, Is dead. He must have been tired. The treaty of peace having been signed. Manager Comiskey can go ahead and sign his ball players for next senron. In settling the little affair with Spain the American commissioners seem to have got both peace and the • pieces. The las: man in the big bicycle race at New York declared 1 he remained in | it for fun. His ideas of fun are at least grotesque. In looking for a soft thing Mr. Leiter hap lodged at the head cf a milk trust. And very early he will be called the "chief cheese" of the concern. Tsi An, the empress dowager of China, is the most despotic woman in the world. That is about what could be expected of a woman who spells Ann with one n." Congressman Roberta just couldn't help it, he was so handsome. If he had had Congressman Eddy's face, he wouldn't have been bothered by the charming damsels of Utah. Arthur Jorg Pegler had half a page of fiction in tine Minneapolis Journal Saturday night. It hardly equaled hi 3 last bit cf fiction, "The Battle of Ttear Island as Seen From Lookout Moun tain." Tuning of the Editors. Part of Their Life. Gov. Llnd can't cure all ills. Some of the professional fault-finders will doubtless howl as of yore.—Lamberton Star. Turn Them AH Out.

Somehow the writer cannot help rejoicing to learn that a number of Republicans will have to get their long legs out of a long continued soft snap.—Anoka Union (Rep.). Getting; Proper Credit. To The St. Paul Globe is due the great est cfedlt for the election of John Lind to the governshlp. The fact that it gets the credit due it is What makes the plutocratic city dailies wince.—Waverly Tribune. Doulile Compliment. John Lind has a great head. If he hadn't, he never would have selected such a good man for private secretary as L. A. Rosing —Cloquet Independent. Certainly Xo Excuse. The Republican managers are now trying to get the fusion forces to make the election of Senator Davis unanimous. Is there any Republican precedent for such a procedure?— Northfield Independent. Bump That Didn't Hurt. It is genrally understood that L. A. Pad dock, of this county, has Dumped up against John Lind's pie counter sufficiently hard to get the appointment .at wheat inspector at Duluth when the proper time comes. Good enough.—Verndale Sun. And There Are Still Other*. The Alexandria Post-News has not seen a Republican paper that has demanded an in vestigation of the wheat inspection depart ment. It should add to its exchange list Senator Miller's Luverne Herald and the Redwood Gazette, two of the best Republican papers in Minnesota.—St. Peter Herald. Dried Ones Will Do. No county ln the state gave a larger ma jority for John Lind for governor than Wi nona county, but, for that reason alone, those who aided in swelling this grand majority do not expect the ripest plums within the gift of the governor-elect. Just a few dried plums will answer.—Winona Herald. Excellent Appointments. Gov.-elect Lind has tendered the appoint ment of private secretary to L. A. Rosing, of Cannon Falls, chairman of the Democratic central committee, aud that of railroad com missioner to Hon. P. M. Ringdal, of Crooks ton. Both appointments are excellent anl both will undoubtedly accept.—Northfield In dependent. Candidate for .1 iidjgenli i i>. W. C. Blcknell's chances of ultimately landing the judgeship of this district are growing apace. We understand that the Dem ocratic strength of this county is to be thrown for him, which is a very commend able thing for the Democrat* to do instead of trying to throw it for one of their party and thus help remove the chambers from Morris. It ls also significant that the local bar, excepting those who are candidates, and their business associates are for Mr. Bick nell. A further fact is that Mr. Bicknell is the only candidate from this city whose name we have noticed in our exchanges from differ ent parts of the district.—Morris Tribune. Mr. Ciliuaii's Position. In The St. Paul Globe of the Ist lust, appears an article tha purport of which is that Hon. H. H. Gilmau, of Winnebago City, is a candidate for dairy and food commis sioner under the incoming state administra tion. In a talk with Mr. Gilman the Press- News learned that he has been In no 3onae a candidate, although if the position is of fered to him he would accept it. His friends believe this section of the state deserves recognition, and that no man is better quail fled than ho to discharge the duties of the office. Besides, he, like the governor him self, has been a faithful worker lv the re form ranks. Both men are old-time Repub licans, but not at present ln accord with their party on the currency question.—Winnebago City Press-News. Churches and Their Work. Rev. Dr. Talntor, the distinguished Congre gational clergyman, of Chicago, will occupy the pulpit of the People's church at both serv ices today.

The farmers in this state should attend to one thing this winter. They should see to it that the legislature investigates the method of disposing of binding twine at the peniten tiary, and let us know how it is that we are required to pay taxes for making the twine and then pay an exorbitant profit on it to re tail dealers. What we want is to have our binding twine ln the future at cost.

While there has been some taik about Senator Davis being re-elected by a unani mous vote of the legislature, it is hardly likely that it will be done. The fusion mem bers of the' legislature may admire the senior senator on account of certain qualtti, s, but he believes in and represents political prin ciples to which they are strong.- and unalter ably opposed. It can hardly be expected therefore that they will stultify tbemeelrea by casting their votes for a candidate for senator with whoso views they are not la accord. This being the caae, some memo t of the fusion forces conspicuous for his abil ity and personal strength will be honored with the votes of the fusion members of the legislature.
