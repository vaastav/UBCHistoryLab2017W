WEEKLY COURIER. C. DOA.TTE, Publiiher. . - INDIANA. JASPER. PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. To the Samte and House 0 Jlepntoitativut Since Uio convenlti;? of Congress, on year 'ago, tho nation liart undergone a prostration In business ami Industrien mich a has nut Ihh-ii wit need with iih formally years. Simulation as to tho cause for this prostration might Ihi In dulged la without prollt, Urause a many theor ies would boiidtunccd a thcro would 1m Inde pendent writers, ml those who expressed their own view without U-nring upon tliu subject. Without Indulging in theories a to thocaiiso of this prostration, 1 will only call your attention to tho fact, and one question as to wlilcli it would seem then! Should ho no disagreement. ei.kments op fmHi-r.itirv. During tili prostration two essential clement of prusjierity liavo lieen most abundant labor and capital. Itoth have Urn largely uneinploy ud. Where security ha been undoubted, capital has been attainable at very moderate rate ; w hero lalsir ha lieen wanted , it liar been found in abundance, at cheap rate, compared with hat ot the ntrcssniie and comfort of lift-could ho purchased with the wages demanded. Two Kreut element of proierity therefore hare not been denied us. A tlilnl might hit add ed: (mr foil ami climate are tinequaled within tiie limit of any contiguous territory, iimler one nationality, for its variety of pro ducts to fccl ami clothe the people, anil In Die amount of simdiis to snare to feed less favored lieople. Therefore, with these fact In view, it t seem 10 nie uiiii wist siaicsmausinp ai uns ses sion of ( :ongres wouhl dicUite, ignoring tht part, tho directing in thv proper channel ol Uioso great elements of prosperity to any Ironie. The (tebtahroMil U thu only clement Hint ran, with always a sound ciirrcncy, outer into our af fairs to cause any continued depression In the In dustrie und prosperity of our people. A great conflict for national existence made necessary for teiniwrary purposes Iht raising of large sums of money, from whatever source attainable. It may luü'c lieen necessary in the wisdom ot" Coi .gross nind I iio not doubt their widom in tliu premise reganling tliu necessity of tho times) to devise n system of national currency, which proved to be itiiporililo to keen on a par with the recognized currenuy of tho civilized world This begot a spirit of speculation, luvnlvingaii extrav agance mid luxury not required for the happine-s or prosperity of the people-, and Involving both di rectly and indirectly foreign Indebtedness. The currency lieingof fluctuating valuo, it wait there fore unsafe to iiold for Icgitimatetransacttoiisre luirlng money, and liocamua subject of specula UonlnltseH. ThesotwoeausoH, however, have In voIvihI iih In foreign indebtislncrH, contraeUfl in Koixl faitli by the borrower and lender, which hIioiiIiI he paid in coin, and according to the IkiiuI agreed upon when the debt wa oontnirted , In sold or its equivalent. T'lio ifood faith of the tiovcmiucnt cannot lie violated towards creditor without national diraeu. Oiircoiiimi-ire hliould ho encouniKol; Ameri can ihip-btiildins and carry iug facilitieh Inrreas vi for'iKti markftn Niunh't for tirixlucts tf the Mil and iiuinufaetorivA, to the end that we m:iy lie able to pay theie debts. Where n market can lie created for the eale of our product , either of the il, thu mine or manufactory, a new meant i llfcovere! of utilizing our idle capital and lalxir to tho advanLige of the whole people. Hut in my Judgment the llrnt ntep toward thin object in to se cure a eurreney gixxl wlierever rlvllizntioii rt'Igiifc; one which. If it become hiiperahundatit with one jicoplo, will llnd a marlet with Mime other a currency which hau as it banh the labor necvtibary to pnxluce It, which will Kivo it iu value. A ItKTl'KN TO PI'KCIi: I'AVMr.XT. Cold and cllver nru now tho recognized liuillimih ot exchange tho civilized world over, and thin wo Hhould return to with thu lea-t practical delay, in view of the pledges of the American Congreis when our present legal-tender MVKtem waH adopted and the debt rontracUM. 'I'here should bo no delay certainly no un ueceary delav in fixing by legislation a method by which wo will return to upecie. To the aceoiupllnhment of thU end I Invite jour fpecial attention. I Indieve llrni ly that there can 1h no prosperous and nrina nent revnal of busineiii and iudtihtriei until a volley is adopteil, wiüi legislation to carry it out, looking to a return to cpecle liasl. It Urn to conceive that the h-btor and t-iHCulativc claies may think, it of value to them to make w called inonej ahuiidant until they can throw a imrtion f their bupieti' upon others; lint even thei, I Indieve. would lie disappointed In the remit If a course sbiiuld lie purMieil that will keep In doubt the value of the leg I tender medium of evchanKO. A revhal of prmlurtlve Industrie Is luvdisl by all clanseit; bv lidiie niiirv than the holder of prop erty, of whatever ort, with debt to liquidate for realization upon iu Kc-t. Put admitting but these tw o cbwei of citiem are to In-henetlttHl bv expansion, would it lie honest togivo It' Would not the generil loi U loo preat to Justify suich relief- Wotild it not he Just as honest and prudent toautliorie each lehbir to issue his on illegal tenders to the extentof Ids liabilities? Tlianto do this wottld it not 1k tsafer for fear of over Issue by unK'rupulotts cn-litors to say that all dcU obliga tions are obliterated in thu L nihil 8L'ites and now we coiumencu anew, each Hspesidnir all he ha at the time, free from Incumbrance 'niesepropo! tlons are too abetinl to bo entertained for a mo ment by thinking people. Kvery delay In the preparation of final resump tion partake of Ihi dishouety, and is only less in degree as tho protmsltion I held out. A con venient season will at last arrhc for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commerce. It will never come, in my opinion, except by posi tive action by Congress, or by national disasters, which will destroy for a limu at least tho rnilit of individual and the Mate at large. A iound cur rency must not lie reached by total bankruptcy of the credit and Integrityofthonatiouandoflndivid tials. I iKjIieveitl In thenowerof Congress at this session to deviso such legislation as will restore contldence, revive all tho Indus tries, start us on the career ot prosperity and have the credit of tho Nation and of tliu people, .Steps toward the return to a )iecle bails are the great requisites to this devoutly to bo sought for re sult, and there are olliers which I may touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing in a currency below that of tijvecie In value labors tinder two great disadvantages : First, having no use for the w orld's acknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver; these aro driven out of tho country, because there U no demand for their use. Sec ond, tho medium of exchange being of a fluctuating value; for it Is only worth Just what it will purchase of gold and silver metals, having an intrinsic value just in proportion to the honest lalxir It takes to tiro dtiee them. A largo margin must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer and producer, It is months from the date of pmdurtiou to the date of realization. Interest umih capital must lc charged, and rink of fluctuation iu the value of that which is to bo received iu payment added, hence high prices acting as a protection to thefor eign producer, who receives nothing in exchange for tho prediction of his skill and labor except a currency good at a staple value the world over. U MMMiis to mo that nothing Is clearer than that the greater part of tho bunten of the xlstlng prostration, for tliu want of a found linauehil system, falls uion tho working man, who must after all produce the wealth, and the salaried man who superintends ami conducts business. The burden falls upon them in two ways: by tho deprivation of employ ment and by the decreased purchasing power of their salarier. It is tho duty of Congress to de vise the method of correcting tho evils which an acknowledged lo exist, and not mine, hull will venture to suggest twoorthree things, whlchsccm to mo as absolutely necessary to a relurn to specie J'avments. As the flrst great requIMte to n return to pros perity, the legal tender clause to tliu law authoriz ing the Issue of currency by thu National (iovern nient should bo repealed, to take eiTict asloall contracts entered Into niter n day fixed In the re Jiealing act, not lo apply, however, to payment of salaries by (iovernment, or other expense now-pnwlded by law to I paid In currency, In the interval pending between repeal and tln.il re sumption, provision hould be made bv which he -"secretary of tho Treasury can obtaln'gold a JJ nuiv become necessary front time to time f roui Jho dato when specie resumption commenced. To this might and should be added a revenue eufllclontly in excess of expenses to Insure an nc Miinulation of gold In the Treasury to sustain re demption, I commend tlih subject to your care äd consideration, lielievine that a favorable so. lntlon is attainable, and that If reached by this Congress that tho present and future generations will ever gratefully remember It as their deliver auco from a tliralldoin of evil and Ulfgnico, HKStMITIO.V Of ntEE 

IUNKI.VO may be authorized with Kiftty, giving tho full protection to bill holden which they have under existing laws. Indeed I would regard free banking as essential. It would give pmper elasticity to the currency. Ait more cuirency should be re quired for the transnctl'n of legitimate business, new hanks would Isi started and in turn banks would wind up their business, w hen it was found there was a tuM.-mbuu4anr! of eurn-ney. The exierleuce and Judgment ol Uiu jKoplo ran liet decide Just how much currency Is required for tho transaction of the business of tho country. It is unsafe to leave thu settlement of this question to Congress, tho Secretary of tho Treasury, or the Jixeeutlve. Congress should make the regula lions under w hich banks may exist, but should not mnko banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper currency Unit sliall bo authorized. Mich iuqiortanre do I attach to tills subject, and so earnestly do I commend It to your attention, Uiat 1 give it prominence b Intro duclng it at the licginmug of this message. ot n roiini.s itr.i.moNs. During the past year nothing has occurred to ilinturb tho general friendly and cordial relations of tho United State with other powers. Tho cor respondence submitted herewith U'twccii this (iovernment and its diplomatic representatives of other countries Indicates the satis! artry cindition of nil questions ls't ween tho l ulled states and tho most of those countries, and Willi few excep tions, to which reference I hereafter made, the absence of any olnts of dlUcrcnccto lie adjusted. Tho notice directed by the resolution of on-gri.-nof June 17, l7t, lo le given to terminate tlic convention of .Inly 17. 1S.V), between the I'nit ed Mates and Itelglum, haslieen given, and the treaty will accord ticlv tennlnato on Uie llrstdav of duly, 1S73. Tills convention Ncurid to certain lt'Igian vessels entering thu iiortii of tliu I'niUil .States exceptional privilege whirli nrenot acconl etto our own vesKds. Other features of the con vention have proved satisfactory and have tended to the cultivation of mutually beneficial commer cial interoouse and friendly relations between the two countrli''). I hoie that tho negotiations, which have Isen invited, will result in the cele bration of another treaty which may tend to the Interest of both countries. Itelations witli Cliina continue to be friendly. During tbojiiistyenrthefearof hostilities lx-tween China and Japan growing out of the lamWng of an armed force iinn the island of Formosa by the latter has occasioned uneasiness. It is earnestly hoped, howeler, that tho dillicultie arising from this cause will Im- adjusted, and that the advance of civilization in theso empires may not lo retard ed by a state of civil war. In consequence ot the part taken by certain citizen of the I'nitcd States m this expedition, our representative in thoe countries halo Urn instructed to impress ii p in tho (iovennnents of China and Japan tho linn intention of this country to maintain strict neutrality in the event of hostilities, and carefully prevent any infraction of law on tho part of our citizens. ciiinxm: immikhatiox. In connection with this subject I call the attention of Congress to a generali v con ceded fact, that the great proxirtlou of Chinese immigrants who come to our shores do not come voluntarily to inaketheir homes witli us and their labor productive of general prosperity, hut come under contract witli head men who own them almost absolutely. In a worse form docs tliis apply to Chinese women. Hardly a reseet tblo errentage of them jK-rform any honorable labor, hut they are brought for shameful pur poses, to tho disgrace of the communities where settled, and to the great demoralization of the youth of those localities. If this had practice can 1 legislated against it will lie my pleasure a well urtdtitvtu enforce any regulation to se cure so desirable an end. OI.lt HIXATIONH WITH JAI'A-. It Is In 'lied that negotiation lietween the (iovernment of Japan and tho oth er iwwera, looking to tiie further opening of the empire and to the removal of various re strictions uMin trade and travel, may soon jiro diice the result desired, which cannot fail to inure to the Ik Hellt of all parties. Having mi previous occasioim submitted to the consideration of Congress tliu propriety of the re lea e of the Japanese liovemment from the furth er paxment of indemnity under the convention of Octolierü, m;i, and as no action had Urn taken therein, it iHcame my duty to reganl tho obliga tions of the contention as In force, and as the oth er powers InteresUil liad recei veil their portion cd the indemnity hi full, tho Minister of the I'nited täte at Japan has been no tilled that tills Uov ornmeiit has received tliu remainder due to tnc Uni to I State under thu convention of Mnioiiftky. I submit the propriety of nppling the income of a part, if not the whole, ot this fund to the education, in the Japanese language, of a man lier of )oting men to be under obligations to serve the Uoveniment for a seciflcd timo a interpre ters at the legation and tliu consulates in Japan. A limited number of Japanese youths might at the same time lie educated in our vernacular and good would result to Uith liovemment. The im portance of having our own citizen i conversant and familiar w ith the language of Japan to act as Interpreter, and in other capacities connected witli the legation and consulates in that country, cannot readily lie overestimated. TUE KMil.lMI AWAItl). The amount awanhil tothefJovcromcnt of Great It ri tain by the mixed commission organized un der the acts ot the treaties of Washington in settle ment of the claims of liritish subjects arising from arts committed lietween April IS, lNil, and April v, ivij, iMVJime pajanie under terms ot uie treaty within tliu past year, and was paid upon the 21 tilay of September, !t74. In tin connec tion, I renew my recommendation, made at the opening ot the last session of Congress, that n sticeial court U created lo hear and determine nil claims of aliens against thu I'nited States arising from acts committed against persons or projierty during thu insurrection. It appears equitable Uiat opportunity should lie offered for iersons of other suites to present their claims, as well as to those ItriUsh sub Ject whoso claims were not admlsdblu under tho late commission, to the early decision of a com lietent tribunal. I recommend the necessary leg islation to organize a court to dispose of 'those claims of alieuswho are referred to, in nn equita ble and satisfactory manner, and to relievo Con gress nml the departments from thu consideration of theso questions. .MISCEI.LAXEOfd 

TOI'ICS. The legislation necessary to extend to tiie colo ny of Newfoundland certain articles of thu Treaty of Washington of tliu sthdayof May, 1871, hav ing Ihmmi hid, a protocol t that effect was sug gested in U-half of tho t'nltcd States and Great llritaiu on the "-'Hm of May List and was duly pro claimed on the following day. A copy of tliu pro clamation is submitted herewith. A copy of tho report of Uie commissioner np pointed under the act of March lit, ISTi, for sur veying and marking Uie boundary lietweeu the Cnited State and the liritish possessions, from thu I.ako of tho Woods to Uiu summit of tho ltocky Mountains, Is herewith transmitted. I am happy to announce that tho fleld-work ot tho commission has been completed, and an entire line from thu northwest corner of Inke of the Woods to the summit of Uie llocky Moun tains has liecn run and marked uimiu tho surface ol the earth. It Is U'lievcd that the amount re maining unexpended of the appropriation made At the last session ot Congress will be suillcient to complete Uio work. 1 recommend Uiat tho nil Uionty of Congress be given to tho use of tho un expended balance of the appropriation on the completion of tho work ot the commission In mak ing lhcrcK)rt and printing necessary map. Tiie court known as the Court of Commission ers of Uie Alabama Claims, created by an act of Congress at Uie last session, ha organized and commenced their work, and His to lie hoped that the claims ndinlsllilo under Uie provisions of Uio net may lie speedily administered. It has lieen deemed iiihisahlo to exercise Uio discretion conferred upon Uio Kxeetttivo at the last session by accepting tho conditions required by the (iovernment of Turkey for the privilege of allow ing citizens of the I'nited Slates to hold real estate In tho former country, and by assent ing to a certain change of the jurisdiction of the courts In the latter, A copy of thu proclamation upon these subjects Is herew ith communicated. AlTAlltS (V THE ltOUlir.lt. There has been no material chango In our rela tions with Independent States within Ulis hemis pheru, which were formerly under Uio dominance of Spain. Marauding on tho frontiers between Mexico and Texas Hill frequently takes plico, deqdto thu vigilance ot thu civil und military au thorities in that quarter. Tho difllcultv of check ing such trespasses along the course of a river of such length as the Itio (.rando, an t so often ford able, Is obvious. It Is IioihhI that thf, efforts of this Government will Iks seconded by those of Mexico to the effectual suppression of nets of wreng. From a report upon tho condition of the busi ness before the American nnd Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the agent on thu part of the I'nited states and dated Octobers, 184, It appear that of the 1,107 claim: Med on Uie part of citizens of tho United States, 4.tt had been Anally decided ami 7,1 w ere in the hands of the umpire, leaving 4o to bo disposed of, and 9 of tho iW claims tiled against tho 1'nlted states, 7irt had Urn ilnallv decided on. Onuwii liefore thu umpire and itl remain to bo disposed of. since tho date of each reort ptlier claims have Urn disused of, reducing somewhat thu number stilt pending, and otiiers have Urn passed upon by thu arbitrators. It las Uroiiic appa rent, in view of theso figures und of tho fart Uiat the work devolving on tho umpire is partic ularly InUirious, that thu commission would lie unahlo to disM)sc of tho entire nuinU-r of claims IM'iidlng prior to the llrst ibiy of t uhruarv, 175, the date fixed for Its explrallon. Negotiations wen; pending looking to the securing of the re stilts of the decisions which liave Urn reached, and to a further extension of the commission for a limited time, which It is confidently hoed will MilUce to tiring all Uie business now Mure it to a llnal close. TIJK MIITH aMKUICAN' STATES. The strife in tho Argentine llepulillc is to le de plored, both on account of the parties thereto and from the probable effect on the interests of those In trade in that qarter, of whom the Culled states are among thu principal. As jet, o far as I am aware, there has Urn no violation ot our neutral rights, which, as well as ourduties in Uiat respect, it shall be my endeavor to maintain and observe. Ills with regret I announce that no further pay ment lias Urn received from thu government of Venezuela on account of thu war in favor of tho citizens of thcl'idtcd states. Hnjic havelteen en tertained that if tiie lEepublle could escape Uith foreign and civil war lor a fewyears.lt groat natural resource would enable Jt to honor it ob ligations. Though it Is now understood to Ihi at peace with other countries, a serious insurrection is reported tob; in iiregress in an imiiortant re gion of that lleiiublic. 'llils may lx-tikeii advan tage of as another re.14011 to delay the payment of thu dues of our citizens. ClilA . Tiie deplorable btrife in Cuba continues, with out any marked change In the relative ml vantages of the contending forces. Tho Insurrection con tinues, but spaln pains no superiority. ix years of strife give tho insurrection a signifi cance which cannot lie overlooked. Its duration and thu tenacity of its adherents, together w iththo absence of manifested Hwer of suppression on the part of Spain, cannot Iks controverted, and may make some Kitive steps on tin? part of the oUier pow ers a matter of self - necessity . M'AIK. I had confidently hoped at this timo to be able to announce the arrangement of some of the im portant questions lietween tliis (iovernment and that of jialn, but the negotiations have been pro tracted. Tho unhappy intestine dissciidons of Spain command our profound sympathies and must bo accepted a perhaps n cause of some de lay. An early settlement 111 part, at least, of thu questions bet with the (invernments, ishniM-d for. In the meantir.ic, awaiting tho results of imme diately peml:ng negotiations, I defer a further and fuller communication on the subject of the relations of this country and Spain. EXr.VTKIATIO.V LAWS. I hate again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the existing laws with reference to expatriation and the election of nationality. Fortiierlv, amid conflicting opinions and divisions. It wasdilUctilt to exactly determine how far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance was applicable to citizens of the I'nited slate. Con gress, by tiie art of the i7th of July, Is;-, assert ed Uie abstract right of expatriation as a funda mental principle of this (,o eminent. Notwith standing such assertion and Uie nece-ity and fre quent application of the principle, no legislation lias Urn had dctlning what acts or formalities shall work expatriation, or whethera citizen shall bo deemed to have renounced or to have lost ills citizenship. Tho importance of such definition is obvious. Therejire'ntatlvesof the I'mtedstatos in foreign countries are continually called uixin to lend Uielr aid and the proUrtlon of the I'nited States to persons, concerning Uie good faith or reality of whose citizenship there is at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treaties furnish some guide; in others it seems left to tho persons claiming the bene tit of citizen ship, while living in a foreign country, con tributing in no manner to Uie performance ot tho obligations and duties of a citizen of the I'nited states, simply as a shield from tho performance of tho obligations of a citizen elsewhere. The status of children Utrn of American parents resid ing in a foreign country, ot American women who havo married alien, of American citizens residing abroad whore such question i not regu lated by treaty, are nil source ot frequent dirti culty and discussion. Legislation on these ami similar questions, nnd particularly uiion which and under what circumstances expatriation can bo accomplished or i to be presumed , is e jrcial ly needed. I'KAL ULiJlVT JfATUKALIZATIOy. In this connection I earnestly call tho nttcnUnn of Congress to thediflicultles arising from fraud ulent naturalization. Tho I'nited Mates wisclv, freely and liberally offers its citizenship to all who may come In good faith to reside within it limits, and on their complying with certain pre-scriU-d reasonable nml simple formalities and condition. Among the highest duties of tnu (iov ernment Is Uiat to afford efllcient and equal pro tection to all it citizens, wheUicr native bom or naturalized. Care should be kiken that such sup iKirt from the (iovernment should not be fraudu lently obtained, and should bo bestowed only iiiMin full proof of a compliance witli Uie law. Nc have frequent instances of illegal and fradu-lt-nt naturalization, nnd of Uiu unauthorized use of certifleale thiisimproiierly obtained. In some cases tin fraudulent character of the naturaliza tion has appeared tqion the face of tho certificate itself ; In others, examination discloses Uiat thu holder bad not complied with the law, and in still others, certiticatea havo lcen obtained where the persons holding them not only were not enti tled to lie naturalized, but had not even been w ithin the UnitedStates.it the timo of the lire -tended naturalization. Instance ot each of these classes of frauds are discovered at our legations, where Uio certificates of naturalization are pre sented, either for tho purpose of obtaining passjiorts or in demanding tho protec tion of the legation. When Uie fraud is again found on Uio face, of such certifi cates they are taken up by the represent atives of the, lioveniniont and "forwarded to Uie Department of State, but even Uio record of the court in which Uio fraudulent naturalization oc curred remains, and duplicate certificates nrc readily obtainable upon the prescntaUon of those for Uiu Issue of passsirLs, or demanding; the pro tection ot tho Government. The fraud sometimes escapes notice, and such certitlcates are notun freuuenUy used In tho transaction of business, to the injury of Innocent parties. Without placing any additional obstacle In tho wav of Uie obtain meut of citizenship, by the worthy and well-intentioned foreigner who comes In good falüi. not without, I earnestly recommend further legisla tion to punish fraudulent naturalization, and to secure the ready cancelation of tho record of eve ry naturalization made iu fraud. Since my last annual message tho exchange has has Iteen made ot the raUUcation of treaties of extradition wiUi Itelglum, Kcundor, l'eru and Salvador; also of a treaty of commerce and nav igation with rem, and 0110 of commerce and con sular privilege wiUi Salvador, nil of which have Urn duly proclaimed, as lias also a declaration with Ktttftia with reference to trade marks. Olit FINANCIAL COXIHTIO.V. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which, bylaw, is made directly to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show receipt nnd oxiciiilitures of the Government for tho lat ilscal year, Uiu amount received fromeach source of revenue, ami the amount paid out for each ot thu departments o the Gov ernment. It will be observed from this roort that the amount of receipt over oxienos has Urn hut '.!,3ll,8tf!,30 for tho tlscal year ending Juno 10, b7l, nml that for tho current 1lsc.1l year the estimated receipts over ex penditures will not much exceed nlno millions of dollars. In view of the large National debt ex isting, nnd the obligations to add one per cent, per annum to the sinking fund a sum Amounting now to i? 1 1, Oi), ox) per annum I submit whether revenues should not lie Increased or exiendltures diminished to reach Uiis amount of surplus to provide for the sinking fund.nnd the partial fail ure to comply w ith the contract and obligations of the (iovernment. At the last session of Congress a very considcra hlcrediictlon was mndo in rates of taxation and In tho number of articles submitted to taxation. Tho question may w ell lie nsked whether or not In some instances, unwlely. In connection with this subject, too, I am of the opinion that the means of collecting Urn ruvenuc, especially from imMrts, has been embarrassed by legislation, so as to make it iiucstionablo whether or not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to tho direct loss ot Uie Treasurv and to the prejudice of the intereits of honest Importers and tax-payers. Tho Secretary of the Treasury, In I1I1 reiwt, favors legislation looking to specie payment thus supM)rtlng views previously expressed in this message. Ileal) recommends economy In appropriations, and calls attention to Uie loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea nnd coffee without U-netlt to tho consumer; recommends an increase of ten cents a pullon on whisky, and fur ther, that no modification be made In the bankand currency bill passed m tho hist sosWon of Con gress, unless uiodlllcatlon should Uroiuu no-ce-sary by reason of tho adoption of mccssary nieasures lor reiuniuig 10 sperm payments, in these rccoiiiuicndntioiid I cordially join, thi;tahht. I 1 would suggest to Congress tiie propriety of re adjusting tliu tariff so a to increase the revenue mid at Uie same time to decrease tho number of articles uimiu which duUes aru levied. Those nr tides which enter Into our manufactures and are not produced at home, It sir ins to 1110 should be entered free. Of those articles of manufacture of which wo pnxluce a constituent part but do not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter fro also. I will instance 1 line wool, dyes, etc. These must U Import! to forma part of thu manufacture ot th higher grades of woolen goods; and chemicals us-! as dyes, compounded in medicines and used iu vari- , oils ways In manufactures come under Uiis class. Tho introduction free of duty of such wools as we do not produce should stimulate tho manufacture of goods requiring these, and therefore would lie a U'ticllt to homo production. There aru many 1 articles entering into home manufactures which we do not produce nurr-olvoH. Uie tariff ttKiii w hich Increases the cost of producing Die manu factured article. All corrections, in tills regard are in the direction of bringing labor and capital 1 iu harmony w ith each other and of supplj lug one of the elements much needed, AUMVANH.VAVV. The report of tho Secretary of War, herewith attached and forming a partof thlsmossage, gives nil the information concerning nil Uio oiierations, ! wants nnd necessities of tho army, and contains many suggestions and recommendations which I commend to your special attenUon. There is no class of (iovernment employee who are hanler worked Uiau Uio army officers and men; none who jierform their tasks morecheorfuHy and more ' efliciently, and under circumstances of greater 1 privations mid bantsliips. Legislation is desir- , able to render more etucient tins branch ot Uie public service. All thu recommendations of Uiu Secretary of War 1 reganl as judicious, and 1 es tiecially commend to your attention the following The consolidation of Government arsenals ; mile age to olllcers traveling under onlers, theexemp- , tion of money received from the SMleof subsistence stores f nun Irlng converted into the Treasury , Uie use of appropriations for the purMseof subsistence stores without waiting for the U'ginuing of Uie Ureal year for which the appreciation is made; for additional appropriations f(r Uio collection of torpedo material, for increased appropriations for the manufacture of amis; lor relieving the va rious states from indebtedness for anus charged to them during the rebellion, for dropping olllcers from the rolls of the army without trial for the offense of drawing pay more than unco for tho Kline )ieriod; for Uie discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks ; and tor Uio establish ment ol a professorship of rhetoric and English litcniture at West Point. The reasons for tho re commendations are obvious, ami are set forth . sufficiently in the report attached. I also recom mend that the statute staff corns of thu army be tlxed, where this has not already Urn done, that ' promotion may lie made ami vacancies illleil as , they H'Ciir in liicli grado wheu reduced Udow the , number llxtd by law. The necessity for such 1 legislation is sieoially felt now in the pay depart ment, whoso tiumlicr Is inadequate to IhoiH'riorm mice of Uie duties now required of them by law. The elllciency of tliu navy ha been largely in creased during last year under the impulse o"f the foreign complications which threatened us. At Uie comtnenceinentot the last session of Congress most of our efficient wooden ships were put in! condition for immediate service, and Uio repair j of our iron clad Heel were pushed witli the ut most vigor. The result Is that most of these are now In an effectivo state, and need only to be 1 manned nml set in commission to go at once into service. Some of the new sloops authorized by ' Congress nrc already in commission and most of the remainder an launched nnd wait only the completion of machinery to enable them to take their place as part of our effectivo force. Two ' iron torpedo shluphave been completed during the last year, nnirfour of our large double-tur- , retel iron clads aru now undergoing repairs. When these are llnishcd .every Üilng Uiat i need ful for our navy as now authorized will lie in con diUon for service, and with the advance in science of torielo warfare, Uio American navy, comparatively small as it is, will be found pow crful for the purpose of a jH-aceful nation. Much ha also Urn nrcomplUhcd during tho year in aid of science and to increase the tum of general knowledge and further the interest of commerce and civilization. Kxtcnsivo and much needed soundings have lieen made for hydro graphic iiurposes, and to tlx the projier routes of ocean telegraphs ; the surveys ot tho great Isth mus have ben undertaktn and completed, and two vessels of the navy arc now employed iu con junction witli those of Kngland, France ana Ger many and Kussia in observation connected with the transit of Venus, useful and interesting to the scientific world. Kstlmate for this branch ot public service do not differ materially from those of hist year, the general supixirt ol the service lielng boiiiewiiat less, and Umso for Improve ment at the various stations rather lower than the corresponding estimate made a year ago. Hie regular maintenance and a steady increase in Uio efliclcncy of tills most important arm, In the proportion to the grow th of our mariUme intercourse and interests, Is re commended to Uie attenUon of Congress. The use of Uio navy during peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employ ment of naval vessels in surveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities on tins con tinent, especially Uie tributaries of Uio two great rivers of south America, the Orinoco nnd Ama zon. Nothing prevents under existing laws such exploration, except Uiat exienditures must lie made in such development ol commercial Inter- 1 est advantageous loUic people reached, and to those who may establish relations w 1th them. POSTAL Ali'AIItN. The education of Uie people entitled to exercise Uie right of franchise I reganl as essential to pros- ( perity everywhere, nml especially so In Itepuhllcs where both education or previous condition doe not enter Into account in gVing suffrage.

A postal convention haa Urn concluded with New South Wales, nn ex change of postal canls established with Switzer land, and negotiations pending for several years past with France have terminated In a convention with that country, which went Into effect last August. An International Postal Congress vns convened in ltcme, Switzerland, in September last, at which the t'nltcd States was represented by an officer of the Post Oflicc Department of much exjierlciice ami ot qualifications for the po sition. A convention tor tho establishment of an Intenintiou.il Postal t'nlon was agreed upon by the delegates of countries represented, subject to the approval of the protcr authorities of Umso countries. I n'spoetttilly direct your attention to Uio report of the Postmaster-General, nnd to his suggestion in reganl to an equitable adjustment ot Uie question of compensation to railroads for carrying mails. I-OriSIAXA AtTAtlt-1. Your attention will bo drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs In some of the .Southern state. On tho Hth of SeptemU'r last the Governor of Louisiana called iion nie, as provided by the Constitution and laws of the I'nited States, to nid In the suppression of domestic vio lence In tharSuito. The call was made in view of the proclamation Issued on that d.iv by I). II, renn, stating that lie was elected Lieutenant Governor In l!to2, and calling uikui tho milllla ot tho State to ami, assemble, anifdrive from power the usurpers, a he designated the olllcers of the sitate Government. On the next day I Issued my proclamation, commanding the Insurgent to ills perso within live days from tho Inte thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession of tho State-house. Steps were taken by 1110 to snppn-ss tho existing ndiclllon and recognize tho lawful jstato Govern ment, but before tho expiration of tho live days Uio Insurrectionary movement was practically abandoned and tho olllcers of the State Government, with some minor excep tions, resumed their pow ers and duties. Consid ering that the present Stale administration of Louisiana had boon Uio only government In that State for neatly two years, that It has been tacit ly acknowledged and acquiesced In a such by Congress, and more than once cxtiresslv recog nized by mo, I rcganled It as my clear tltltv.w hen legally called uikui for that purK-, to prevent 1 its overthrow by an armed mob under pretense of fraud nnd Irregularity In tho election of 1672. 1 have hen-toforo called Uiu intention of Congress to Uiis subject, stating that 011 account ot tho frauds and forgeries committed at said election, anil Urause it appears Uiat tho returns thereof were never legally canvassed, it wan ImiHisslblu to tell thereby who wu cIiosmi, but from the liest sources of information at my command, I have always hclivcd Uio present state ofllcers received a majority of tho legal votes actually txist at that election. I repeat what I said in my sircinl mes sage of February lit, 1S73, that, In the event of no action by Congress, I must contltiuo to recognize Uie government heretofore recognized by me. sol nii.i. liisiiiini.iis. I regret to say that witli preparation for tlw late election a decided indication apic-tred iu some localities In the Southern States of a deter mination by arts ot violence and Intimidation to deprive citizens of thu freedom of tho ballot be cause of their political opinions. Hands of men, masked and tinned, mndo Uielr appearance. While Leagues and other societies weie formed. Large quantities of arm aud ammunition weru hiiiMirted and distribute! to those organizations. Military drills, with menacing demonstrations, were held, and with all these munler enough were committed, which spread terror among those whose nolltical oninlon was to U mmut-os. cd It possible by these Intolerant and criminal proceeding. 1 11 some places colored laborers w ere com in Hod to vote according to the w Ishc of , their employers under threat of discharge If they act"! otherwise, and there are too many im. Lances in which, when these threats were oisreganlod, they were remorselessly executed by those who made them. I understand Uiat the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent this state of 1 things, ami Uie act of MayMl, ls70, with amend ments, was passed to enforce It provision; Uio olijirt of tills Uing to guarantic to all citizens tliu right to vote, and to protect them in the tree en joyment of Uiat right. F.njolnod by Uie Constitu tion to take care that the law be faithfully exe ' cutitl, and convinced by undoubted evidence that violations of said act 'had been committed, and that a widespread and flagrant disreganl of it was contemplated, the projH-r officers were in-struch-d to prosecute the offenders, and troop wore stationed at convenient point to aid theso ofliccrs, if necessary, in the jierfonnaiice of Uieir duties. Complaints are made of this interference by Federal authority, but if said amendment and net do not provide for such Interference under thu circumstance as aUne stabil, then they nru w ithout meaning, force or effect, and the whole scheme of colored enfranchisement le worse than mockery, and littlo lictter than a crime. Possibly Congress limy Und It due to truth and justice to nscertaiu, b menus of a committee, whether thu alleged wrongs to colored citizens for pollUcal purHises aro real or the report thereof were manufactured for tho occasion.

Another trouble has arisen iu Arkansas. Ar ticle i:i of the Constitution d the state which wa adopt.il In i.mw, aud upon the approval of which by Congress the State was restored to representa tion as one of the States of the t'nlon, provide m effect that liefore any amendment proposed to this Constitution shall Income a part thereof they shall lie passed by two successive Assemblies am! then submitted to and ratified by a majority of Uiu electors of Uie state, voting thereon. On the 11th of -May, ls74, the Governor convened an extra session of the General Assembly of the State, which, on the IfUi of the same monUi, pawed an act providing for a convention to frame a new Constitution. Pursuant to tliis act, nnd at an election held on the 30th Juno, 1S74, the Conven tion wa approved and delegates were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14th of last July, and funned a new Constitution, the schedule of which provided for the election of an entire now set of State olllcers in a manner contrary to tho Uien existing election laws of the State. On the 13th of October, 1S74, the Constitution, nu therein provided, was submitted to Uie people for Uielr approval or rejection, and , ncoording to thu election returns, was approved by a large majori ty of Uiose qualified to vote thereon, nnd at tho tame election liersons were chosen to till all Uio State, county and township offices. The Gover nor elected In Ifü'i for Uio term of four year turnnl over his otllre to the Coventor chosen un -der tho new Constitution, w bereu jon"the Lieutenant-Governor, also elected in h'i fora tenn of four years, claiming to act n Governor nnd alleging that said pnicecding by which the new Constitution was made ami a new set of oillccn electel weru tincostitiition.il, Illegal and void, called upon me, as provided in section 4, article 4 of the Constitution, to protect the ."-täte ngaiuH domestic violence. As Congress Is now investi gating the iKilltlcal affairs of Arkansas, I havo declined to Interfere w ith Uie subject. F.xocu live interference with the affair of a State 1 repugnant to public opinion, to the feeling or those who IV0111 their official capacity must lie used in such interposition, and to bhn or tliosu w bo must direct. I'nles most clearly on Uicsidu of law, such Interference Uvomo a crime with the law to support it, thus condemned without a hearing. I desire, therefore, that all necessitv for executive direction in local affair mav lie" come unnecessary and obsolete, anil invite the at tention, not of Congress, but of the cople of Uio I'nitcd States, to tliu cause and eflectsof theso unhapny questions. Is Uiere not a disposiUon on oue side to magnify wrongs aud outrages, and on the other side to belittle or justify them? If pub lic attention could lie directed to a correct survey of w hat i right, and to rebuking wrong and aid ing proper auUioritlcs in punishing It, a better state of feeling would Ui Inculcated, and the soon er would we have that peace where it would leave, tiie State free Indeed to regulato freely their own domestic affairs. 1 hcllevu on the part ot our citizens of tho Southern States Uio better part of them Uiere Is a disposition to lie law abiding and do no violence either to indi viduals or the laws existing; but do Uiey do right in Ignoring the existence, of violence and bloodshed and In resistance to constituted au thority'? I sympathize witli Uielr prostrate con dition, and would do all in my jkiw er to relieve Uiem acknowledging that in some instances they have had most trying government to livo under, and very oppressive one in thu wav of taxation for nominal improvement, not giving U'lieflt equal to Uiu hanishlp imKcd; but can they pro claim themselves enUrelv blameless for this con dition:' They cannot. Violence ha Urn ram pant in some localities and has further lieen Jin-titled or denied by those who could liavo jireventcd it. The theory is raised Uiat there i to lie no fur ther Interference on tho part of the General Gov ernment to protect citizen within a State where the State authoriUe fait to give protection. This is a great mistake. While I remain Executive nil the law- ot Congro and Uio provisions of Uio Constitution, Including the amendment added thereto, will lie enforced with rigor. Hut I re gret that they should havo added one jot or tittle to executive duties and power. Iet thero bo fairness in the discussion of Southern quesUons, the advocates of both or all iolltlcal parties giv ing honest, truthful reimrt of occurrences, con demning the wrong and upholding the right, and soon all will lie well. Under existing conditions the negro votes Uie lCcpublican ticket because be know hi friend nru of Uiat party. Many n good citizen votes Uio opposite, not because ho agree with tho great principles of state which separate the parties, titit Urauso generally bo Is opposed to negro rule. This Is a most delusive cry. Treat thu negro as n citizen and voter, as he is and must remain, and soon parties will be divided, not on thu color Hue, hut un principle. Then wu sliall luve no complaint of sectional Interference. THE ATTOHM:V-(IE.Si.AI.M

I re iqiectfully suggest to Congress the propriety of Increasing the number of Judicial district hi tho United State to eleven, the present nttniUr being nine, and Uie creation ot two additional Judge ships.
