an* GRENADA SENTINEL SATURDAY, DEO. 12, 1885. For V. a. Sweaters, j. a. UEOBUL K. C. WALTHALL, The veteran Singleton baa been nonxiceil already as a canoidate for Con gress in his District at the next election. The steamer that sunk on the Chata* heochee river, ou the 3rd init., carried down forty thousand dollars worth of oranges, _ J,akos sales of public lands, mostly pine in the Southern part of the State, were made at the land office in Jackson, for several days past. _ A kesthaining order has been issued by United States District Judge McCoy, at Atlanta, against the declaration of the recent prohibition election. The advance in pig iron at Pittsburg last week, has filled the minds of specu. lators, with the hopes of an early revival of trade all along the line. So mote it he. Mb. Anderson Walker, near Vicks, burg, jumped from a train on the Valley road and was Killed, and Mr. Tom West fell from a railroad bridge near the same city, and was killed; both accidents hap-* pened recently. Dan Gross and Jonas Evans, both colored, got into an altercation on last Sunday about eight milea east of Wood ville, Miss., when Grosa with his knife almost disembowled Evans, from which he soon died. Bv way of comparison on the election of President pro tern of the U. S. Senate, it is proposed to elect Senator Jones, of Nevada, who is a foreigner by birth, and could not succeed to the Presidency in case of the death of Mr. Cleveland. Then the office would go to the Speaker of the House, who is a Democrat. Among the losses at the recent fire in Brookhaven were the Copiahian and the Leader offices. We extend to our brethren of the quill our warmest sym pathies, as we feel assured that few of them are so prosperous that they can stand such a backset without almost financial demolition. When Cuthbert Jones got mad with Hon, J. Floyd King, both of Louisiana, he got mad all over, and abused him from the crowu of his head to the ball of his foot. If stringent abuse can arouse corresponding ire, Greek will meet Greek when they collide. Tub Brookhaven Leader says, that Doctor Watts was elected because he made the negroes believe that he re duced the tariff on matches. The Doctor got away with the Leader, and its idio syncracies, and will make a good member in the next, as he did in the last Legisla ture. Some of the Southern people will have a chance at no distaut day not only of seeing' but of hearing Roscoe Conkling, the great ex-Senator, aud said to he the greatest lawyer of New York, ns he is employed by the anti-prohibitionists of Atlanta, to prove the unconstitutionality of the late election. We join the Examiner, of Aberdeen, in urging the establishment of printing aud type-setting in the curriculum of practical studies at the State Female Col lege, at Columbus. There ought to be talent enough in that institution foget up a journal devoted purely to literary subjects. ■. ■ - Gen. Jakb Sharpe of Louudes, H. C Williamson of Carroll, Captain Frank Burkett of Chickaskw, L.M Southworth of Carroll, Dr. V. B. Watts of Lincoln, are spoken of in connection with th* Speakership of the next Houae of Rep resentative!. How many more there may he, we do not pretend to surmise. John A. Logan was called by the Republican caucus in Washington a wsek ago to be President protem,of the Senate, or Vice-President. John thought it might interfere with his chances to be President three years hence, and refused the proffered sugar coated pill. John Sherman took it, however. AVe ars glad to welcome our energetic young friend Will D. Cowan hack in the fraternal union, of the best fallows in the world, tbe editors. Having made fors tune and fame in the Duck Hill Dispatch he proposes to amplify both in the Pickens Post, and will do it, if the Pickens people will meet him in a spirit of liberality. Success to the Post in the hands of Will D. Cowtn. The selection of John W, Daniel, on the 8th by the Democratic caucus in Richmond, Va., virtually placed in the Senate of the United States, one of the foremost men of tbe age. Tried a* a sol dier, he was true to every trust. Tried M a lawyer, ha has proven great .Vi learn ing and almost matchless in Apee c h. Tried in literature, he. has proven hie familiarity with books and the lemons they inculcate. Tried as a politician and Htafas man , he ranks any man in his in fluence over popular assemblies, in the bid Dominion. Wa are well satisfied, that we are pur. suing a cold trail when we write on the •object of less cotton and more meat and brwad, milk and butter, poultry and eggs, ig U M hard to break away from old habits in men, as it is to learn new tricks to old dogs. But we feel imprest ed with the consequence of the subject, and will try to infuse some of our own feelings in the hearts of others. The fascinating part of cotton planting is that there is always a ready cash market for it This is what misleads lbs mind of our people so far as to neglect every other crop to that extent, that they over look feed crops for their teams, end then have to come to town and buy western hay and corn. That there is no money in this method of farming, is so appar ent that a blind man both physically and intellectually should see it. working hard in the hot sun of the 6outh to make cotton to swap for corn and hay that grows in the tempered climes of the West, and unless cotton is very high and provisions for man and beast are very low, this system will not only be un» profitable to the Southern farmer, but in e lew years will inevitably lead to de judgements and Sheriffs sales. When we make our own corn, meat and hay in abundance an we can, it does not matter ao much what is the price of cot. ton. Whether it be high or low, it is the farmers clean cash, or net gainB, which he can deposit in bank, lend out, or in vest in something profitable at home or abroad. With this method, farmers can not only live better and have more money but it opens some opportunity of improv ing their lands, houses and fences. But inducement is brought to bear This is crea every against this sensible plan of southern farming. Ii we make nothing hut cot ton, it is the merchants business to buy and sell that which we do not make and he must make a profit or he soon would make an assignment. Then there are largo aggregations of capital in the hands of commission merchants, who haudle a it the cotton, and make the farmer pay every time they touch it. These men flood the country with plausible papers, showing the wealth and influence of cotton as a great commercial and finan cial factor. Then we have great journals proclaiming the fallacy that "cotton and grain are not enemies," while the truth is, they keep wide apart to be united in the bonds of friendship. Then we have a set of men who meet every year to pro claim the glories of cotton and the gor geous wealth it is anually pouring into the laps of Southern farmers. Then, we have a convocation of all the world at New Orleans, to wonder at the cotton farmers riches, when not o*e in a hun dred has money enough to get there and see them. Then we have a Governor to proclaim to the assembled thousands, that "The world must hare cotton." Under these misleading excitements we do not wonder that we make no progress in our domestic resources. We have two large, well-equipped and well-regulated Lunatic Asylums, and yet there is not room enough in which to place our insane. The increase of crazy people in our State is something that de mands the closest investigation and research as to the causes which lead to condition of this class of this help)* our people. In the day* of slavery in sane nogroes were very rare. Under their new conditions of freedom they are becoming as subject to intellectual aber ations as tbe whites. Tbe ancients have left us all over the globe many evidences of their advancement in the arts and natural sciences and in religion, but among them we find no great monumen tal ruins dedicated to the insane; and what they did with them, if they were as common then as now, we have no definite knowledge. We read of greal Mosques end other buildings devoted to religion, and justice and war among the Mohammedan nations, but nothing for the crazy. We believe the same is the case among tbe Brahmins and Buddhists of India. In all the Christian countries of our time, the insane are tenderly cared for, and nowhere better thau in Mississippi. King of Alabama, Wilson of New York, and Hendricks of Indiana, all died Vice-Presidents of the United States. The National Government stands now with a Democratic President at the head, a Democratic House to sustain him, with a Republican Senate and Vice-President in opposition. As the Senate has not yet elected their President, who will be acting Vice-President, we are firm in the hope that they will confer the office upon a Democrat. This, would not only be an evidence of magnanimity on the pqrt of the power that has held the reins of the Government for a quarter of a century, but it would be an acknowl edgement of reBpect to the will of the people. This would obviate many com plications that might arise in the legisla tion of the United States. Before the war the white people work ed their negroes for the benefit of the Lords of the loom. Now, the Lords of the loom, the railroad and steam-ship companies work the old masters and niggers too, in their interest. They all get rich in manufacturing aud taking to market what the cotton farmers mako of six or seven million bnlcH of the raw material. The wealth in the hands of our farmers reminds us of a full nest robbed of its eggs, when there is nothing left, but an angry old hen, and the place where she brooded over her future greats MM. Tukhjc is no danger of extortion when competition is plentiful. All that we want ie pleat; of iU Each man, or firm, business know* just how low to go to make a profit. No sensible man expects any one to buy goods and sell them be low cost; no man expects a lawyer or doctor to practice his profession at prices that will impoverish him; no man ex pacts a railroad to carry passengers and freight below the cost of moving them. But the question arises in the minds of the masses, what are the costs of these business transactions and professional services? When there is competition sufficient to show that there is no chance of colisuion, we may rest assured that none of them are charging beyond a legitimate margin. But leave the whole business of these great factors in our pro gress to one man or firm, or any special associated capital, and we will feel the merciless evidences of overcharges or extortion. A'hile we haye never doubted the constitutionality of a railroad com* mission, we have often thought of their inexpediency. One railroad tapping this town, or passing it, might make our bills of charges so high among our merchants that people from the country would wonder at having to pay more for a bars rel of flour here than they would have to pay at a town only 40 or 00 miles distant. So would think the farmer, who wished to ship bis cotton. Of course, at first thought,people would say our merchants are too greedy. The more merchants in our town, the better will be the chances of getting goods at a fair valuation. So with every other efficient means of what we call civilisation. So if there are those who entertain the idea of another, or a dozen or more railroads reaching Grena da, and wining us out, we do not enjoy that happy opinion. pur. the and new own The is and the in or is He received the Cheyenne Sun of Dec. 3d, a handsomely executed sheet typo graphically, printed at the Capitol of the Wyoming Territory. To receive such a paper, printed away out on the confines of our great country, brought about im mediate speculation as to what brought it from its distant home to Grenada in north Mississippi. Carefully we scanned its pages, finding in every column not only evidenco of civilization, but en lightenment in all the refinements of life until we struck "Our Laud Office," and then it was, that we were not far from the whereabouts of our friend Edgar S Wilson, formerly the able editor of the Jackson New Missiesippian, but now the Register of the Cheyenne Land Office. We were truly gratified to see such a good account of our friend. Having put every feature of his responsible trust in good condition, he bad sat aown to busi ness. We can tell the Sun and the peo ple of Wyoming, that in Mr, Wilson they have a man whose moral and intel lectual worth will sustain him as a gov ernment officer, and as a citizen of the the Territory, to the fullest extent. The Hon. John Sherman has been elected by the Senate of the United States pro tem President of that body, which makes him Vice-President, and in case of tba deatli of Mr. Cleveland, the reins of the Government will fall back into the hand* of the Republican party 1 . Sherman, probaly, is the ablest man in the Senate on the Republican side, but has ever been considered an ex treme extremist in his views on all sub jeefa affecting the interests of the North and South, He may feel the force of the responsibility now resting ou him, and rise to the dignity of the patriot as well statesman in the official discharge of his duties. Tna following is a spociman of the pulpit eloquence and theological philoso phy of the Rev. Sam Jones, which we cut from an exchange. Search the gos pel of Matthew, Mark Luke and John, and then all the epistles of all the other writers of the New Testament, and see if you can find a parallel in low slang and cow-boy expressions. Yet there are men who are ready to say great is Sam Jones, of Atlanta, or some other coun try where the rashness of fanaticism has succeeded tbe second sober thought of the people: "You old forked-stick, with a yellow alapaca coat on, hung up in God Almighty's watermelon patch to scare the sinners out." Tub President's message is out, and instead of being remarkable for its brev ity, it is one of the longest ever present ed to Congress. But it bears the marks of a statesman, whose greatness of thought embraces all the diversified in terests of this great country, both foreign and domestic. These arc subjects which he handles with great clearness and vigor, which the American people will read with special interest. While the msssage is too long for us to print, we can commend it to the favorable consid eration of all who are interested in our progress at home and our condition abroad, and we shall endeavor to give it to our readers in full next weak. William H. Vanderbilt, the richest man in the United States, if not in the world, fell dead at his residence in Now York, on Tuesday last. He had dollars in cash, than there are seconds «f time in six years, and yet all that he could get out of his unmeasured wealth, was wbat he could eat and more wear «I3
