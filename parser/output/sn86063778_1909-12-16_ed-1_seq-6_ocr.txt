Tbo following Interesting story is reported by a postofllco official: 1 "Tao of the mulls la resorted to by artful crooks aa u ruoat convenient way of defrauding the defcUBOb'juj public.

This la not always the final disposition of such ca?i??numbers of theao Individuals are summoned to court, and In many Instances after trial, sentenced to servo long terms in the penitentiary. "Porhaj'S one of the most unusual schemes to defraud through the molls was discovered not long ago After thorough Investigation by the Inspectors It was ultimately suppressed. but not until after the promoters had reaped o harvest. The schemes consisted of an appeal to the people for financial assistance in bebulf of an armless girl. For the purpose of bringing her condition to the public attention, she published a booklet and sent It broadcast throughout the country. The booklet ?'?? devoted to n brief history of the girl's life, detailing sn Occident by which she hud lost both of her arms TU*- narrative was accompanied by UluKtratlons of the uousu al work she performed with her feet. With each booklet mailed was enclosed u coin card requesting the remittance of 2 5 cents for the same, und a circular letter appealing to the recipient for money with which to build o home and get aome good motherly woman to take care or it Tor her. "The Investigation made by the Inspector developed the ihc*. the armless girl had entered Into a contract with a man. who resided in the pame city, to furnish the capital necessary to publish the booklet. In return tlio man was to receive, and did receive one-half of tbs not proceeds deriving from the sale of the booklet. Ho was first roliuburae 1 for the money he had advanced to pay for Ith publication. "On hla Initial tlalt to the town where the business was being carried on. the Inapector found that the enterprise had attained such proportions that tho services of eleven persons, In addition to the armless <lrl und her manager, were required. Th? girl Informed the Inspector on this visit that at thut time throe thousand booklets per day were being mailed, that the dally receipts : amounted to from fSG to |1I?0, ond that the business was steadily In- 1 creasing. She further informed the < Inspector thut up to that time ?he < had accumulated as her share of the 1 proceeds more than f 10,000. While the representations appearing in the ' booklet respecting tbe physical con- ' 'ItIon of the girl were true, she had long passed the stage where she was 1 Jopeudont upon charity.
