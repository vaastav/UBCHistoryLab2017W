Albany Register. (- IT L l 1 1 :t I Z XT President's Message, To the Senate and Uovbe ov Ukpkeskntativks : Since the convening of Congress, Ipae year ago, the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries such as ha not Men witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to causes for this prostration might be indulged in without profit, because as many theories wiuid be advanced as there would be independent writers those who expressed their own views without borrowing uon the subject. Without indulging in theories as to the cause ofjlhls prostration. I therefore will call your attention Duly to the tact, and to some ques tions as to which it would seem there should be no disagreement. r.OTIl I A COB AMU 

CACITAI. UjceMPI.OYF.D. Dnring this prostration Swo essential elements of prosperity have been most abundant labor and capital. Both have been largely unemployed. Where security- has been undoubted, capital has been obtaiuable at very moderate rates. Where labor has been"S,anted, it has been found in abun dance, at cheap rates compared with those at which the necessaries and comforts of life could be pur chased with the wages demanded. Two great ele ments of prosperity, therefore, have not been de nied us. A third might be added : AN StXMEKT THAT ISN'T IDLE. Our soil and climate are unequalled within the limits trf" any contiguous territory under one na tionality, for" its vuriety of products to food and clothe a people, and hi the amount of surplus to spare to teed less favored people; therefore with these facts in iev. it seems to me wise statesman ship that this session of Congress would dictate ignoring the past and distributing in the proper channels these great elements of prosperity to any people. THE 1TUI.U DEBT. The debt abroad is flit- only element thut can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the industries or prosperity. A great conflict for national exist ence made necessary for temporary purposes the raising a lanrc stun of money from whatever source attainable. It was made necessary in the wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the S remises regarding the necessities of the times, to cvise a system of national currency which it proved to be impossible to keep on a par with the recognized currency ol the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation involving an extrava gance and luxuries not required for the happiness or prosperity of n people, and involving, both di rectly ami indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency being of fluctuating value, proved to be unsafe to holdfbr legitimate transactions requiring money, and became a subject of speculation in it self. "These two causes, however, have involved us in a foreign indebtedness contracted in good faith by borrower trnd lender which should be paid in coin and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted gold or its equivalent. The good faith of the Government cannot be vio lated towards its creditors without national dis grace. Our commerce should be encouraged, American ship building and carrying capacity in creased, foreign market- sought for products of the soil and manufactures, to the end that we may be able to pay these debts. Where a market is created for the sale of the products, either of the .soil, mine or tlie manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to die advan tage of the w hole people. Til E ClItP.KNCV. But. in my judgment, the first step toward ac complishing this object, is to secure a currency good wherever civilization reigns, one which if it tiecomes superabundant with one people will find a market with some other ; a currency which has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it. which will give us value. Gold and silver are now the recognized mediums of exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable delay, in view of the pledges of the American Congress when our present legal tender system was adopted and our debt contracted. There should be no delay, certainly no unnecessary delay, in fixing by legislation a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplishment of this end I invite your especial attention. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted, with legis lation to carry it out. looking to a return to a specie basis. It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it of value to make a so-called money abundant until they can throw a portion of their burdens upon others; but even these. I believe, would be disappointed in the re sult, if a course should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of legal tender medium of ex change and prevent a revival of productive indus tries needed by all classes, by none more than the holders of property, of whatever sort, with debts to liquidate from realization upon its sale. But ad mitting that the two classes of citizens are to be benefited, by expansion, would it be honest to give it? Would nut the general loss be too great to jus tify such relief." Would it not be more just and honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal tenders to extent of his liabili ties than to do this? Would it not lie safer for fear of over issues by unscrupulous creditors to say that all debt obligations are obliterated in the lnited States and now we commence anew, each possess ing all lie has at the time free from all encum brance'.' Tlie propositions are too absurd to be en tertained for a moment by thinking people. Every delay in preparation for rinfU resumption partakes of this dishonesty. A season will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges, to com mence. The time will never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by Congress, and national disasters which will destroy for a time, at least, the credit of individuals and' the state at large. A sound currency must be reached by total liankrupt cy and credit of nation and of individuals ? I be lieve it is in the power of Congress, at this session, to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, revive all industries, send us on a career of pros perity to last for many years, and to save'the credit of the nation and of "the people. Steps toward the return to a specie bai are the great requisites to this end, devoutly to be sought for, and others which I may touch upon hereafter. A nation deal ing in a currency below that of specie in value, labors under two great disadvantages : first, having no use for the world's acknowledged medium of exchange, gold and silver, these are driven out of the country because there is no demand for their use. Second, the mediums of exchange iu use be ing of a fluctuating value, (for, after all, it is only worth just what it will purchase of gold and liver, metals having an intrinsic value, just in proportion to the honest labor it takes to produce them,; a large margin must be allowed for prolit by the manufac turers and producers. It is months from the date of production to date of realization ; interest ujxjii capital must be charged, and risk of fluctuation in the value of getting that which is to be received in payment added. Hence, high prices acting as a protection to the foreign producer who receives nothing in exchange for the product of his skill and labor except a currency, good at a suible value, the world over, it seems to me that nothing is clearer than that the greater part of the burden of existing prostration tor tlie want ot a sounti ninui cial system, falls upon the workingman, who must, after all, produce the w ealth, and the salaried man who superintends and conducts business. The bur den falls on them in two ways: by the deprivation of employment and by the decreased purchasing power of their salary-. It is the duty of Congress, not mine, to devise the method of correcting the evils which are acknow ledged to exist; but I will venture to suggest twoor three things which seem to me as absolutely neces sary to a return to specie payment. As a first great requisite in a return to prosperity, the legal tender cl, wise to the law authorizing the issue ol currencv by the national Government should be repealed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act, not to apply, how ever, to payments of salaries by the Government, or for other expenses now provided by law to be paid in currency. In the interval pondinjfc between re peal and final resumption, provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it becomes necessary from time to time from tlie date when specie resumption may commence. To this might and should be added a revenue sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an accumulation of gold in the Treasury to sustain redemption. I recommend this subject to your careful consideration, believing a favorable solution is attainable, and that if reached by this Congress, the present and future generations will ever grate fully remember it as their delivery from a thraldom of evil and disgraer-. With resumption, free hank ing may be authorized with safety, giving full pro tection to bill-holders which, they have under ex isting laws. Indeed I would regard free banking as essential. It woiUd give proper elasticity to the currency, as more currency should be required for the transaction of legitimate business. New banks would be started in turn. Banks would wind up their business when it was found there yvas a super abundance of currency. Theexpcrience and judg ment of the people can best decide just how much currency is required for the transaction of the business of this country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of this question to Congress, the Sec retary of the Treasury, or the Kxeeunve. Congress should make tlie regulation under which banks may exist, but should not make banking a monop oly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper currency that shall be authorized. Such import ance 1 attach to this subject, and so earnestly do I commend it to your at' entiou I give it prominence by introducing it at the beginning of this message. OCR 

FOREIGN RELATION'S. Durine the nast year nothing has occurred to dis turb the general friendly and cordial relations of the Cuitea states witn otner powers, rue corrc snondciice submitted herewith, between the Gov ernment and Its diplomatic representatives in other countries, shows a satisfactory condition of all ques tions between the l nited States and most of those countries, and with few exceptions to which refer ence is hereafter made the absence of any points of difference to be adjusted. The notice directed by the resolution of Congress of Jnne 17, 1874. to be Kren to terminate me convention oi juiy n, jaw, tween the United States and Belgium, has been riven, and the treaty will accoi dincly terminate on the first dav of July. 1S7.1. This convention secured to certain Belgian vessels, entering the ports of the United States, exceptional privileges, which are not accorded to our own vessels, inner part oi tne convention have proved satisfactory, and have tend ed to the cultivation of mutually beneficial com mercial intercourse anti lrienuiy relations uetween the two countries. I hope that negotiation, which has been invited, will result in another treaty which may tend to the interest oi ootn countries, our re lations continue friendly. narinr th past year the fear of hostilities be . twneu China and Japau. growing out of the landing of armed forces upon the Island of Formosa by the latter, has occasioned uneasiness It is earnestly hoped, however, that the difficulties arising from this cause will be adjusted, and that the advancing civilization in the Empires may not be retarded by . Mate of war. In consequence of the part taken by mmn.nfih iTnltad States in this expedi tion, our representatives in those countries have been instructed to impress upon the Governir -n U o China and Japan the firm intention of this coun try to maintain strict neutrality in the event of hos tilities, and carefully prevent any infraction of law ob tne part oi our citizens. In connection with this subject I call the atten tion of Congress to the generally conceded fact that the greater portion of the Chinese immigrants who come to our shores do not come ostensibly to make their homes with us, and their labor productive of general prosperity, but come under contract with head men, who own the men almost absolutely. Iu worse form does it apply to Chinese women; hardly a perceptible per centage of them perform honorable labor; they are brought for shameful purposes, to the disgrace of the community where they are settled, ana to the great demoralization of tlie youth of thote localities. If this evil practice can be legislated against, it will be my pleasure as well as duty to enforce any regulation to insure so desirable an end. It Is hoped that negotiations between the Govern ment of Japan and treaty powers, looking to the further opening of the Empire, and to the removal of various restrictions upon trade and travel, may soon produce the result desired, which cannot fail to inure to the benefit of all parties. Having on previous occasions submitted to the consideration of Congress the policy of the release of the Japan ese Government from the further payment of in demnity under the convention of Oct. 'A!, 11, and as no action has been taken thereon, it became my duty to regard the obligations of the convention as in force : and as the other powers interested have received their portion of the Indemnity in full, tlie Minister of the United States in Japan has. in be half of this Government, received the remainder of the amount due to the United States under the con vention of Simonoseki. I submit the propriety of applying the Income of a part if not the whole ot this fund to the education, in the Japanese lan guage, of a number of voung men to be under ob ligations to serve the Government for a specified time, as interpreters, at the Legation and the Con liiIaiau in isnsn A limited number of Japanese youths might, at the same time, be educated in our vernacular and mutual benefit would result to both Governments. The importance of having our own citizens competent and familiar with the language of Japan, lb act as interpreters and in other capaci ties connected with the Legation and Consulates in that country, cannot readily be over estimated. The amount awarded tne Government of Great Britain by the Mixed Commission, organized under the provisions of the treaty of Washington, in settlement of claims of British subjects arising from acts committed between April 18, 1811, and April !), 1B6.V became payable under the terms of the treaty within the past year and was paid upon the 21st day of September, 187, In this connection I renew my recommendation at the opening of last session of Congress, that a special court be created to hear and determine all claims of aliens against the United States arising from acts committed against their persons or property during the insur rection, it appears equitable that an opportunity should be offered to citizens ot other states to prove their claims as well as to those of British subjects whose claims were not aduiissable udder the late Commission, to the early decision of some compe tent tril unal. To this end I recommend the neces sary legislation to organize a court to dispose of these claims of aliens referred to in an equitable and satisfactory manner and relieve Congress and the departments from the consideration of these questions. The legislation accessary to extend to the colony of Newfoundland certain articles of the treaty of Washington of the 8U1 day of May, 1S71. having been passed, a protocal to that effect was signed iu behalf of the I'nited States and Great Britain on the 2Sth day of May last, and was duly proclaimed 011 the following day. A copy of the proclamation is submitted herewith. A copy of the report of the Commission appointed under the act of March 19, 1872, for surveying and making tlie boundaries between the United States and the British Possessions from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky mountains, is herewith transmitted. I am happy to an nounce the field work of the Commission has been completed, and the entire line from the northwest corner of the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky mountains has been run and marked upon the surface of the earth. It is believed Uiat the amount remaining unexpended of the appropriation made at the fast session of Congress will be sufficient to complete the office wort. I recommend that authority of Congress be given to the use of the unexpended balance of the appropriation in completion of the work of the Commission iu making the report and printing the necessary map. The court known as the Court of Commissioners cf the AUmauta claims, created by an act of Con gress at the last session, has organized and com menced its work, and it is to be hoped that the claims admissible under the provisions of the act may be speedily ascertained and paid. It has been deemed advisable to exercise the discretion conferred upon the Execuuvc at the last session, by accepting the conditions required by tlie Government of Turkey for tlie privilege of allowing citizens of the United States to hold real estate iu the former country, and by assenting to a certain change in the jurisdiction of the Courts in the latter. A copy of the proclamation upau these subjects is herewith communicated. There has been 110 material change in our rela tions with the independent States of this hem isphere. which were formerly under the dominion of Spain. Marauding on the borders between Mexico and Texas still frequently takes place, despite the vigilance of civil and military authorities in that quarter. The difficulty of checking such trespass along the course of a river of such length as the Itio Grande, and so often fordable, is okvious. It is hoped the efforts of thin Government will lie seconded by those of Mexico to tlie effectual sup pression of acts of wrong. From the report upon the condition of business before the American and Mexican Joint Claims Commission, made by the ageut on the part of the United States, and dated October '28. 1874, it appears that of the 1.017 claims riled on the part of citi zens of the United States, 4.s.i had been finally de cided, and 73 were iu the hands of the umpire; leaving 4ti2 to be disposed of : and of U98 claims tiled against the United States, 720 had been finally decided on. Oue was before the umpire, and 271 remained to be disposed of, reducing somewhat the number still landing ; others have been passed up on by the arbitrators. It has become apparent, 111 view of these figures, and of the fact that the work devolvinn on the umpire is particularly laborious. that the Commission would be unable to dispose of the entire number or claims penuiug, prior to reu ruarv 1 , 1S7:, the date fixed ior expiration. Nego tiations are pending looking to the securing of the results of tlio decisions which have been reached and to a further extension of the Commission for a limited time, which it is confidently hoped will suffice to bring all the business now before it to a liual close. The strife in the Argentine Republic is to be de plored, both on aceount of the parties thereto and from the probable effects on the interests of those engaged in trade in that quarter, of whom the United States are among the principal. As yet, so far as I am aware, there has been no violation of our neutrality rights, which, as well as our duties in that respect, It shall be my endeavor to maintain and observe. it is with regret I announce that no further pay ment has been received from the Government of Venezuela on account of the awards in favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes have been en tertained that if the Republic could escape both foreign and civil war for a few years its great natur al resources would enable it to honor its obligations. Though it is now understood to be at peace with other countries, a serious insurrection is reported iu progress 111 an important region 01 mat itepuonc. 5'hLs may be taken advantage of as another reason for delay in the payment of the dues of our citizens. The deplorable strife In Cuba continues without any marked change in the relative advantages of the contending forces. The insurrection continues, but Spain has gained no superiority. Six years of strife give the insurrection a significance which can not be ignored. Its duration and the tenacity of its adherents, together with the absence of manifested power iu suppression on the part of Spain cannot be controverted, and may make some positive steps on the part of other powers a matter ol self- necessity. I had confidently hoped at this time to be en abled to announce the arrangement of the impor tant questions between this tvovemmant ami tnatoi Mnain. but thi? neeotiadons have been protracted. The unhappy iutenial dissensions of Spain com mand our profound sympathy and must be ac cepted as, pet lisps, a cause of this delay. An early settlement, in part, at least, of tlie questions be tween the uovernments is nopen. in tne mean time, awaltitur the results of immediately pending negotiations, I defer a further and fuller communi cation on the subject of the relations of this country and Spain. EXPATRIATION AND NATURALIZATION. 1 have again to call the attention of Congress to the unsatisfactory condition of the state of the laws with reference to expatriation and election of na tionality. Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and decisions, it was uimcuu 10 exacoy uetermiiie now far the doctrine of perpetual allegiance was appli cable to citizens of the United States. Congress, by the act of '27th July, 1868. asserted the abstract right of expatriation as a fundamental principle of this Government. Notwithstanding such assertion and the necessity of the format application ot the prin ciple, no legislation has been had defining what acts or formalities shall work expatriation, or when a citizen shall lie decided to have renounced or have lost bis citizenship. The importance of such a.deeision is obviout. The representatives of Ihc United States in foreign countries are continually called upon to lend their aid and the protection of the United Suites to persons concerning tlie good faith or the reality 01 wnose citizensnip mere is at least great question. In some cases the provisions of the treaties furnish some guide; in others itseems left to the persons claiming tlie benefit of citizen ship while living in a foreign country, contributing ill no manner to uie ouuiuuuie 01 mi, uuum 01 u citizen of the United States, and without the inten tion at any time to assume and undertake these du ties, ami to use the claims of citizenship of the United states simply as a shield from the perform ance of the obligations of a citizenelsewhere. The status of citizens born of American parents resid ing in foreign countries, 01 American women wno have married aliens, of American citizens residing abroad, whete such question la not regulated by treaty, is a source of frequent difficulty and discus sion. Legislation on these and similar questions, and particularly aenning wnen ana unaer wnat circumstances expatriation can be accomplished, or Is to be presumed, is especially needed. In this connection I earnestly call the attention of Congress to the difficulties arising from fraudu lent naturalization. The United States wisely. wno n ble and simple formalities and conditions. Among the first duties oi tne uo vernment is to anoru nrra oftieif-nt and effectual protection to all its citizens whether native or naturalised. Care should be iibm that u. rteht. carrvinir with It such support from the Government, should not be fraudulently obtained and should be bestowed only upon full proof of a compliance with the law. But there are frequent instances or illegal and fraudulent natu ralization, and of the unauthorised use of certifi cates thus improperly obtained. In some cases tlie fraudulent character of the naturalization ha ap nottred noon the face of the certificate itself -. in others, examination discloses mat the holder bad not complied with the law : and In others still, cer tificates have been obtained where tne persons hold inn- d.n nut onlv vera not entitled to be natural Ized. but had not even been within the. United States at the time of the pretended naturalization Instances of each of these classes of fraud are dls- freel noe ran y oners us citizensnip to an may come in good faith to reside within its limits on ihflr nom'plvine with certain prescribed rcasona covered at our Legations, where certificates of natu ralization are presented either for the purpose of obtaining passports, or in claiming the protec tion of the legation. When the fraud is on the face of such certificates they are taken up by the repre sentatives of the Government and forwarded to the Depaitment of State ; but then the record of the Court in which they, the fraudulent naturalizations, are secured, remains, and duplicates are readily obtainable. Upon the presentations of these for die issue of the passports, or on demanding the protec of the Government, Hie fraud sometimes escapes notice. Such certificates are not infrequently used in transactions of buiuess to the deception and in -jurv of innocent parties. Without placing any ad ditional obstacle in the way of the obtainment of citizenship by the worthy and well-intentioned for e gner who comes in good faith to cast his lot with us. I earnestly recommend further legislation to punish fraudulent naturalization, and to secure the remedy call the attention of record of every nat uralization made iu fraud. ?j NEW TREATIES. Since mv last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification of treaties of extra dition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru and Salvador; also of treaty of commerce and navigation with Pern, and one of commerce and consular privileges with Salvador; all ol which have been duly pro claimed, as bus also a declaration with Russia with reference to trade marks. -' .. RECEIPTS AM) EXPEN DITTOES REVENUES SINKING Ft'NP. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which bv law is made directly to Congress, and forms no part of this message, will show the re ceipts and expenditures of the Government for the last fiscal year; the amount received from each source of revenue, and the amount paid out for each of the Ueoartmenis of the Government. It will be ob served from this report that the amount of receipts over expenditures has been but 82,314.882 '30 for the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1874, and that for the current fiscal year the estimated receipts over ex penditures wiil not much exceed nine millions of dollars. In view of the large national debt exist ing, and the obligations to add one per cent, per annum to the Sinking Fund, a sum amounting now to over fcH.Ooo.OOO per annum, I submit whether the revenues should not bo increased or the expendi tures diminished to reach this amount of surplus. Not to provide for the Sinking Fund is a partial failure to comply with the contracts and obligations of the Government. At the last session of Con gress a very considerable reduction was made 111 rates of taxation, and the number of artiules submitted to taxation The question may well be asked whethar wisely or not in some in stances. In connection with this subject, too, I venture opinion that the means of collection of the revenues especially from Imports have been so embarrassed bv legislation as to make it question able whether or' not large amounts are not lost by failure to collect, to the loss of the Treasury and to the prejudice of the interests of honest importers and taxpayers. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his report." favors legislation looking to these pay ments, thus supjiorticg the views previously ex pressed in this message. He also recommends economy in appropriations : calls attention to the loss of revenue from repealing the tax on tea and coffee.witlmut benefit to the consumer: recommends an increase of lo cents a gallon on whiskey ; and further, that no modification be made iu the bank ing and currency bill passed at the last session of Congress unless modification should become neces sary by reason of the adoption of measures for re turning to specie payment. In these recommends tions I cordially join. THE JUDICIOUS TARIFF. I would suggest to Congress the propriety of ad justing the tariff so as to increase the revenue and at the same time decrease the number of articles upon which duties are levied. Those articles which enter into our manufactures and are not produced at home, it seenis to me. should be entered free ; those articles of manufacture of which we produce a constituent part but not produce the whole, that part which we do not produce should enter free. Also. I will instance fine wools, dyes, etc. These articles must be imported to form a part of the manufacture of the higher grades of woolen goods. Chemicals, such as dyes, compounded medicines, and used in (various ways in manufactures, come under this class. The introduction, free of duties, of such wools as we do not produce would stimulate the manufacture of wools requiring the use of those we do produce, and therefore would be a benefit to home production. There arc many articles enter ing into home manufactures which we do not pro duce ourselves, the tariff ujioii which increases the cost of producing the manufactured atticle. Mil corrections in this regard are iu the directiorWof bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other and ol supplying one of the elements properly so much needed. THE ARMY. The report of the Secretary of Wir, herewith at tached and forming a part of this message, gives all the information concerning the operations, wants and necessities of the army, and contains many suggestions and recommendations which I com mend to your siccial attention. There is no class of Government employes who are harder worked than the army officers and men, and none who per form their tasks more cheerfully and efficiently and under circumstances of greater privations and hardships. Legislation is desirable to render more efficient this branch of the public service. All the recommendations of the Secretary of War, I regard as judicious, and I especially commend to your at tention the following: The consolidation of the Government arsenals ; the restoration of mileage to officers traveling under orders; the exemption of money from the sale of subsistence stores from be ing "covered'' into the Treasury ; the use of appro priations for the purchase of subsistence stores without waiting for the beginning of the fiscal year for w hich the appropriatien is made: for addi tional appropriations for the collection of torpedo material; for increased appropriations for the man ufacture of anus: for relieving the various States from indebtedness for arms.charged to them during the rebellion : tor dropping officers from the rolls of the army without trial for the offense of draw ing pay more than once for the same period: for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks: and for the establishment of a professorship of Rhetoric and English Literature at West Point The reasons for the recommendations are obvious, and set forth sufficiently iu the report attached. I also recommend that the status of the staff corps of the army be fixed, where this has not already been done, so that promotions may oe made and vacan cies tilled as they occur in each grade when re duced below the number to be fixed by Haw I. The necessity for such legislation is specially felt in trm department is below the number adequate to per- lorm the unties reqjiirea oy law. THE SAW. The nxv creased during last year under the impulse of the foreign complications which threatened us at the commencement of the last session of Congress. Most of our efficient wooden ships were put in con dition for immediate service, and the repairs of our iron-clads w-ere pushed with the utmost vigor. The result is that most of these are effective and need only to be manned and set in commission to go at once into "Service. Some of the new sloops author ized by Corrgres are already in commission, and most or the remainder are launched and wait only the completion of their machinery to enable them to take their places as part of our effective force. I wo iron torpedo snips nave occu couipieico itur inar the last vear. and four of our lareo double tur reted iron-cfads arc now undergoing repairs. When these are finished, evervthine that Is needful of our navy, as now authorized, will be iu condition for service, and with the advance in the science of tor nedo warfare, the American navv. comparatively small as it is, will be found at any lime powerful for the purposes of a peacerui nation. SCIENTIFIC AND COMMERCIAL EXPLORATIONS AND OB SERVATIONS. Much has also been accomplished during the year in aid of science and to inoreasethesumof general knowledge and further the interests of commerce and civilization. Extensive and much needed soundings have been made for hydrographlc pur poses and to fix the proper routes ol ocean tele graphs. Further surveys of the great Isthmus have been undertaken and completed, and two vessels of . i. .. . , i i ; ..J.,,. r .1. v. tile llfiVJ nif IIOY CUI(I1UJCU 111 l.llljUIIOIUH,i , IUI those of Einrland. France. Germany and Russia, in observations connected with the transit of Venus, useful and interesting to the scientific world. The estimates for this branch of the public service do not differ materially from those ol last year the general support of the service being somewhat loss, and those for improvement at the various stations, rather larger thau the corresponding estimate made a year ago. Tbc regular maintenance and steady increase in the ofllcerinir of this most important arm, and in proportion to the growth of our mari time intercourse and interest, is recommenuea to the attention of Congress. The use of the navy during peace might be further utilized by a direct authorization of the employment of naval vessels in surveys of the supposed navigable waters of other nationalities in this Continent, especially the tributaries of the two great rivers of South America, tne Orinoco ana tne Amazon. iNoining prevents, under exlstina laws, such exploration, except that expenditures must be made in such expeditions be- yonu tnose usually pruviueu lor in uie appropria tions. The field designated is unquestionably one of interest and one capable of a large development of commercial interests advantageous to the people reaciicu aim tuosc wno may csiannsji relations w uu them. EPl'CATIOX THE POSTOFFII'E. The education of the people entitled to exercise the right or franchise, 1 regard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so tn a Re public where both education and previous condi tion uo not enter into account in giving suurngp. Next to the Public School, the Postofnce is the great agent of education over our vast territory. The rapidity witn wnicn new sections are oeing sottiea, thus increasing the carrying of the malls In a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not alarming, ine report oi tne rosimaster uenerai herewith attached, snows that there was an in crease of revenue in this department in 1873 over the previous year1, of 81,074,411, and an increase of cost of carrying tlie mails and paying employes, ot 3,Otl,4Ci7 91. The report or the Postmaster General gives interesting statistics ot ins department, ana comparing them with the corresponding statistics or a year ago, show a growth in every branch or the department. A postal convention has been concluded with New South Wales, an exchange or postal cards ex changed with Switzerland, and the negotiations penuiug ior severui years pasi wiiu r rauce nave terminated in a convention with that country, which went into effect last August. An interna tlonal postal congress was convened iu Berne, Switzerland, in September last, at which the United States was represented by an officer or the Post Office Department of much experience and of qual ification for the position. A convention ror the es tablishment of an international postal union was agreed upon by the delegates of the countries rep resented . subject to the approval of tlio proper au thorities or those countries. I respectfully direct your attention to the report of tho Postmaster General, to his suggestion in re gard to an equitable adjustment of the question of compensation to railroads for carrying the mails. THE LOUISIANA CASK. Your attention will be drawn to the unsettled condition of affairs In some of tho Southern States. On the 14th of September last the Governor of Louisiana called upon me. as provided by the Con stitution and laws of the United States, to aid in the suppression or domestic violence in that State. This call was made in view of a proclamation issued on thst day by D. B. Penn stating that he was elected ucut governor in ib.j, ana calling upon the militia of the State to arm, assemble and drive from power the usurpers, as he designated ' tlie offi cers of the State Government. On the next day I Issued my proclamation commanding the insurgents to disperse within five days from the dste thereof, and subsequently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession othe State House, steps were taken by me to support the existing and rec ognized State Government, but before the expira tion ot the Ave days tho insurrectionary movement was practically abandoned and the officers of the State Government, with some minor exceptions, re sumed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State Administration of Louisiana has been the only Government tn that State for nearly twoyears, that it has been tscitly acknowledged and acquiesced in as such by Congress, anil more than once expressly recognized by me, I regarded it as my clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent its overthrow by nn armed mob. under the pretense of fraud and irregularit v in tiie election of 1872. I have heretofore called" the at tention of Congress to this subject, stating that on account of the frauds and forgeries committed at said election, and because it appears that the re turns thereof wore never legally canvassed. It was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen ; but from the most reliable sources of information at my command, I have always believed the present State officers received a majority of tlie legal votes actually cast at that election. I repeat what I said In my special message of February 18, 1X73. that in the event or no action by Congress I must continue to recognize the Government heretofore recognized by me. 

SOUTHERN TROUBLES GENERALLY. I regret to say that with the preparations for the late election, decided indications appeared in some localities in Southern States of a determination bv actsof violence and intimidation to deprive citi zens of the freedmen clas of the ballot , because of their political opinion. Bands of men, masked and armed, made their appearance ; White Leaguers and other Societies were formed; largo quantities of arms and ammunition were Imported and distri buted to these organizations: military drills with in creasing demonstrations were held.and with all these murders enough were committed to spread terror among those whose political action was to be sup pressed, if possible, by these intolerant and criminal proceedings. In some places colored laborers were compelled to vote according to the wishes of their employers under threats of discharge if they voted otherwise, and there are too many instances in which when these threats were disregarded thuy were remorselessly executed by those by whom made. I understand that the Fifteenth Amend ment to the Constitution was made to prevent this and like state of things, and the act ot May 31, 1870, with amendments, was passed to enforce its provision, the object of this being to guarantee to all citizens tlie right to vote, and to protect them in .

ARKANSAS, Another trouble has arisen in Arkansas. Article 13 of the Constitution of the State, which was adopted in 1SGS, and upon the approval of which by Congress the State was restored to representa tion as one of the States of the Union, provides In effect that before any amendments proposed to this Constitution shall become part thereof, they shall be passed oy two successive assemblies, and then submitted and ratified by a majority of the electors of the State voting thereon. On the 11th of Mav. lsi. tne liovernor conveneu an extra session of the General Assembly of tho State, which on the 18th of the same month passed an act providing for a convention to frame a new- Con stitution. Pursuant to this act, and at an election held on the 30th June, 1S71, the convention was ap proved and delegates were chosen thereto, wh:eh assembled on the 11th ol" July, and formed a new Constitution, which provided for the election of an entire new set of State officers iu a manner contra ry to the then existing election laws of the State. On the 13th of October, 1874, this Constitution, as there in provided, was submitted to the People for their approval or rejection, and, according to tlie election returns, was approved oy a large majouty of those qualified to vote thereon, and at the . same election persons were chosen to fill all the State, county and township offices. The Governor elected in ;87' for the term of four years turned over his office to the Governor chosen under the new Constitution; whereupon the Lieutenant-Governor, also elected in 1S7J. for a term of four years, claiming to act as Governor, and alleging that said proceedings bv which the new Constitution was made and a new setof oftluaK lected. were unconstitutional and illegal, i Jffj upon me. as provided in section I, article 4 'tine Constitution, to pretect the slate against dftn.estic violence. As Congress are now in vestigating the political affairs of Arkansas. I have declined to interfere. The whole subject of Execu tive interference with the affairs of a State is re pugnanto public opinion, to the feelings of those from wh-yH their official capacity must be used in such Interposition and to him or those who most desire it. Unless most clearly on the side of law, such interference becomes a crime : with the law to support it, as condemned without u bearing '. FROM ARKANSAS BACK TO THE GENERAL QUESTION, I desire that all necessity for Executive decision in local affairs may become unnecessary and obso lete. 1 Invite the attention, not of Congress, but of the people of the United States, to tlie causes and effects ol these unhappy questions. Is there t a disposition on one side to magnify the wroinrs and outrages, and on the other side to belittle them or justify them? If public opinion could be directed J-to a correct survey of what is and to rebuking I wrong and aiding the proper authorities in punish- ing ii, l eiLei state ui jren ug w uuiu oe nicilicateu, and the sooner we would have that peace which would leave the States free indeed to regulate their own domestic affairs. I believe, on the part of our citizens of the Southern States, the better part them, there is a disposition to be law abiding, and to do no violence either to individuals or the laws existing. But do they do right in ignoring the ex istence of violence in resistance to constituted au thority ? I sympathise with theirjprostratecondition and would do all in my power to reliove them, ac knowledging that In some instances they have had most trying Governments to live under", and very oppressive ones in the way of taxation for nominal improvements, not giving benefits equal to the hardship imposed, but can they proclaim them selves entirely Irresponsible for this condition. They cannot. Violence has been rampant in some localities and has further been Justified or denied by those who could have prevented it The theory is raised that there is to be no further interference on the part of the General Government to protect citi zens within a State where the State authorities fail to give protection. Th is is a great mistake. While I remain Executive all the laws of Congress and tlie provisions of the Constitution, including the amend ments added thereto, will be enforced with rigor ; but 1 regret that they should have added one jot or tittle to Executive duties and powers. let there be fairness In the discussion of Southern Questions the advocates or both or all political parlies giving honest, truthful reports of occurrences, coudi inning the wrong and approving tho right. Then all will be well. Under existing conditions the negro votes the Republican ticket, because he knows his friends are or that party. Many a good citizen votes the opposite, not because he is at variance with the great principles or State which separate parties, but because, generally, he Is opposed to negro rule. This is a most delusive cry. Treat the negro as a citizen and voter, as he is and must remain, and soon parties will be conducted not on tho color Hue but on principle. Then we shall have no complaint or sectional interference. DEI'ARTMKNT OF JUSTK F. The report of the Attorney-General contains valu able recommendations relating to trie administra tion of justice in the Courts of the United States, to which I invite your attention. I respectfully sug gest to Congress the propriety of increasing the number of Judicial Districts In the United States to eleven (tho present number being nine) and the creation of two additional judgeships. The territo ry to be traversed by the Circuit Judges is o great, and the business or the courts so greatly increasing, that it Is growing more and more impossible for them to keep up with the business requiring their attention. Whether this would involve the neces sltyof adding two more Justices of the supreme Court to the present number, I submit to the judg ment or Congress. 

INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The attention or Congress 1 invited to the report of the Secretary ol the Interior and to the legisla tion asked for by him. The domestic interests of the people are more intimately connected with this Department thau with either or the other two De partments or the Government. Its duties have been added to from time to time, until they have become so enormous that without the most perfect system and order it will be impossible for any Secretary of the Interior to keep trace or all official transactions having his sanction and done in his name, and for which he is held personally responsible. THE PEACE POLICY. The policy adopted for the management of Indian affairs, known as the Peace Policy, has been ad hered to with most benctujial results. It is confi dently hoped that a few years more will save our frontier from Indian depredations. I commend the recommendation of the Secretary for the exten sion or tile homestead laws to Indians, and for some sort of Territorial government for the Indian Terri tory. A great majority or the Indians occupying this Territory aro believed to be Incapable of main taining their rights against the more civilized and and enlightened man. Any lerritorlal form of gov ernment given them, therefore, should protect them tn their homes and property for a period of at least twenty yean; and before its final adoption, should be ratified by a majority of those affected. The report of tlie Secretary of the Interior, here with attached, gives much interesting statistical in formation, which I abstain from giving an abstract of, bnt refenyou to the report itself. PEMSIOKS OP 181'J The act of Congress, providing die oath which pensioners must subscribe befom ilmuinn thui. pension, cuts off from tius bounty a few survivors of tne war oi iovi, residing m too southern States. I recommend the restoration of this lmnm to ti such. Tne number of pensons whose names would be restored to the Mat of pensioners is not large. They are all old persons, who could have taken ho part In the rebellion, and the services for which they were awarded pensions were In defense of the whole country. AaWCTLTUBAL THE CENTENARY. The report of the Commissioner or Agriculture, herew ith, 06ntains.iugges.tions of much interest to the general public and refers to the approaching Centennial anniversary and the part his Department is reauy to take 111 it. 1 leel tnat tne nation at large is interested in having this exhibition a success, and commend ta Congress such action as will secure a greater general interest 111 it- Already many for eign nations have signified their intention to oe represented at It. It may be expected that every civilized nation will be represented. CIVIL SERVIC E REFORM. Tlie rules adopted to improve the Civil Service of tue uuvurumeut nave oeeu acme red to as closely as has been practicable, with the opposition with which they meet. The effect ot it has been essent ial benefi cial 7J on the whole, and has tended to the eleva tion of the service: but It is Impracticable to main piin them without direct and positive support of Congress. Geneially the support which this re form receives is from those who give it their sup port only to find fault when the rules are appar ently departed from. Removals from office without preferring charges against parties removed, are frequently cited as departures from the rules adopted and thefretentlon of those against whom charges are made by irresponsible persons and without good grounds, is also olten condemned as a violation ot them. Under these circumstances, therefore, I announce that if Congress adjourns without positive legislation on the subject of Civil Service Reform, I will regard such action as a dis approval of the system, and will abandon It except so far as to require examinations for certain ap pointees to determine their fitness. Competitive examinations will be abandoned. The gentlemen who have given their services without compensa tion, as members of the Board, to devise rules and regulations for the government of the Civil Service of the country, have shown much zeal and earnest ness in their work, and to them as well as to myself it will be a source of mortification if it is to be thrown away. But I repeat that it is impossible to carry this system to a successful issue without general approval and assistance and positive law to support it. TOE LABOR AND CAPITAL PROBLEM VARIOUS ELE MENTS OF THE QUESTION. I have stated that the elements of the prosperity to the Nation, capital, labor skilled and unskilled, and products of the soil still remain with us. To direct the employment of these Is a problem de serving the most serious attention of Congress. If employment can be given to all labor offering it selr, prosperity necessarily follows. I have ex pressed the opinion, and repeat it, that the first res olution to the accomplishment of this end is the substitution of a sound currency in place of one of a lluetuating value. This secured, there are many interests that might be fostered to the great profit of both labor and capital. How to induce capital to employ labor is tlie question. The subject of cheap transportation has occupied Bnvimuu o, wuicoa. i'o ugm uu mis qties tion will, without doubt.be given by the commit tee appointed by the last Congress to investigate 1,11.1 IVJIU1V UJAflJ 11111, QUUiCVH, A revival of shin builrlincr and narftini,,!., iron steamship building, is of vast importance to our national prosperity. 1 ne L lilted States is now paying over 41,000.000 per annum for freights and passage on foreign shins, to be carried abroad and expends in tho employment and support of other ports, beyond a fair percentage of what should go to foreign vessels, estimating on the tonnage and travel of each re.-iectively.

Executive Mansion, Dec. 7, 1S74. The Difference. The Boston and Phila delphia papers have been indulging in a little friendly controversy regarding the merits of Ben Franklin as a financier. It seenis that Franklin left 1,000 to tlie city of Boston and the same sum to the city of Philadelphia, to be loaned to married mechanics in small stuns, to assist them in starting business, and the in terest to be compounded from year to year for a hundred years. According to liis calculation each legacy woulc". amount to 131,000 in a hundred vears. r.c the expiration of which lie desired that the money should be appropriated to certain pnoiic improvements m the respec tive cities. Philadelphia's " talent " has only increased, at the end of 8C years, to fciS,135, and tho Bulletin concludes from this that Franklin was no " business king," and that be had a very poor understanding of what monov can do and what it cannot do. But the Bos ton Advertiser says it was not Franklin's fault. but the management of the Pliilailelohiustew ards, that the sum is not nearer the philoso pher s calculations to-day. in isoston the legacy amounted, Jan. 1, 1874, to $182,278, nearly four times as much as the Philadelphia fund. During the next fourteen years, if the monev is compounded' at six per cent., the sum will reach 108,300; We shall certainly leave our money to Boston. It is hard work, says the Chicago Tribtuie, to get ahead of a determined Western man on a matter in winch principle and pennies are in volved together; especially difficult for the railroads to fight the masses. The great bore nowadays is legal fare. Passengers were in the habit or getting aboard trains and paying "legal fare." To prevent this, the Chicago, Burlington and Quiney Railroad devised a means of forcing passengers to mv full fare. It was to make them show tickets before get ting a hoam. At tiuriington, tlie other day, a passenger bought a ticket and took his seat. He then passed the ticket out of the window to a friend, who also took bis seat, repeuting the operation until the car was tilled up: When the conductor came round there was but one ticket, and legal fares enough to keep the Supreme Court ia continuous sassion lor a century. But the vaine the Burlington busi ness men set upon time is not revealed to us. While Captain Drew, agent of the James river Hue of steamers, was sitting in bis chair at City Point a day or two ago in a state of profonnd sleep, some rascal stole out of bis mouth a set ol artificial teeth.

New York. Dec. 5. Rufus Hatch Is not included among the directors believed to have been engaged In selling Pacific Mail stock short. The chief sin ners were Sage & Osborne. The latter sold as broker tor lay Gould, who has long been a heavily loaded bear. Hatch denounces Sage bitterly, declaring he was kicked out of the Presidency. Trenor W. Park, a Director or the Panama Railroad, thinks Sage must resign that Presidency also. He says the Isth mus Railroad Company does not depend on the Pa cific Mail Company for business, but would put on their own vessels immediately if the Pacific Mail Company should withdraw from the route. The supposition Uiat a combination had been effected between steamers and overland railroads was er roneous, and the thing was less probable since the withdrawal of Sage. Steamers advanced the rates moderately because they were unreasonably low. They could command a good business at the ad vance despite the railroads. New York, Dec. 5.
