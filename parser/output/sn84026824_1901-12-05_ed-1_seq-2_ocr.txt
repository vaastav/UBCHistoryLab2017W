Cjjt S|iej|>triisfoton Register H. L. SNYDER, Editor and Publisher, Shkpherdstown, W. Va. Thursday, December 5, 1901. Reed is there do longer, but his rules still run Congress. The President has Congress on his hands, for the first time. The President has fired his shot at the trusts?but he never touched them. The Steel Trust has had prosperity the past year. Its profits have been $75,000,000. Congress is in session once more, and the trusts are still doiDg business at the old stand. Whatever else Congress may do, there will be no failure to dispose of the surplus in the Treasury. Senator Scott has conceded that Brewer Schmulbach has the right to run for the Senate. Now let the beer flow. President Roosevelt had nothing spectacular in his message to Congress. Ferhaps he is arranging for some fireworks later on. "There must be no disturbance of the tariff," boldly declare those who are getting rich from the present schedule. Of course not?it is too good a thing?for them. The business of train robbing in the West seems to be a little slow, but the trusts are going on with their peculiar style of robbing seven days in the week?and nights also. The Hon. Mark Hanna has no reason for falling out with President Roosevelt. There seems to be no disposition to withhold anything that the bosses in the party may desire. There is talk of running our friend W. L. Mansfield for Congress in the fifth West Virginia district. If the people want to be represented by an honest and able man, he's that sort. Perhaps the recommendation of the President that Congress should be economical in its expenditures was intended for a joke. That big surplus in the Treasury and economy do not go together. The President says that there are still troubles ahead tor us in tne runippines. This is indeed true. We are likely to have four hundred years of worry, just as Spain had, if we hold the islands bo long. The position of Senator Wellington in the United States Senate is a very peculiar one. The Republicans won't have him and the Democrats don't want him, so about the only thing he can do is to dock by himself. The President wants to see a great Navy established by our government. We think that the question as to who really won the battle of Santiago ought to be settled before anything further is done. Was it Sampson or was it Schley? When it comes to a question of passing the ship subsidy bill or just throwing open the Treasury vaults, there is really not much choice, except that in the former event the swag will not have to be divided among so many. The President may be very indedependent, indeed, but his message shows that be has no idea of running independence into the ground. He'll probably suit the party bosses just about as well as the average occupant -f il. Tf 71_ 1a. - XT oi me ?uiie xiuuse. The Supreme Court haa decided that the Philippine Islands are a part of the United States, and that tariff duties on goods imported from the islands are illegal. The Court also decides that Congress has the right to impose tariff duties if it so desires. There is little doubt that Congress will be absolutely dominated by the small but powerful clique of politicians who usually run things to suit themselves. Men of independence who seek to remedy some of the glaring evils in public affairs are to be unceremoniously choked off. Congress assembled in Washington on Monday. In the House of Representatives the Republicans elected Hon. David B. Henderson, of Iowa, Speaker, the Democrats voting for Hon. James D. Richardson, of Tennessee. The Republicans have a majority of about 50 in the House. The Senate was called to order by Senator Frye, of Maine, president pro tern. It is announced that au agreement has been reached by the United States by which Denmark will sell to us the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, known as the Danish West Indies. These two islands contain together about 44 square miles, and we are to pay between four and five millions of dollars. This is a pretty steep price, for them, but a good deal cheaper of course, than the Philippines, which are costing us something like a million doUars a day?and even at this rate we still have to fight for a foothold in them. Islands come very high, but Uncle gam seems to want them. President Roosevelt's Message. The first message of President Roosevelt was submitted to Congress on 1 Tuesday. Although he discusses many subjects of public importance, the President has no startling recommendations or suggestions, nor does he say ( anything to which his party may ob- , ject. He refers to the assassination of President McKinley, and adviees that no anarchist should be permitted to remain in this country, but should be deported. The President takes up the subject of trusts, but thinks that action relating to these combinations should be cautiously considered. He 6ays: The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one State, always do business in many States, often doing very little business in the State where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the State laws about them; and as no State has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through State action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the nation should, without interfering with the power of the States in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision; banks are subject to it, and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. * * * I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National Government to exercise control along the lines above indicated, profiting by the experience gained through the passage and administration of the interstate commerce act. If, however, the judgment of the Congress is that it lacks the constitutional power so pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. The President favors reciprocity, but does not believe there should be any general change in the present tariff laws. He favors the restriction of immigration. Not only would he reenact the laws excluding Chinese laborers, but he would apply an educational and economic test to Europeans who come to the United States. He thinks that the shipping interests should be built up, and here's the chance for the subsidy to the rich ship owners. He advises that a new cabinet officer be created, to be known as the secretary of commerce and industries. He favors the acclamation of arid lauds in the West by a vast system of irrigation, and also suggests government action looking to the preservation of forest lauds. Referring to foreign affairs, he says our government intends to abide by the Monroe doctrine and insist upon it as the sure meane of securing the peace of the Western Hemisphere. *" . L 1 1 j ,1.. mere are sun irouoits aueau iu iue Philippine Islands, he says, and iu dealing with the people of these inlands we must show patience and strength, forbearance and resolution. We must give them opportunity for industrial development. The President wants the work of increasing the Navy kept up; more battleships must be built; 5,000 additional seamen and marines should be provided and a national navy reserve established. The Army is big enough at present. He thinks a cable should be laid to Hawaii and the Philippines. A canal across the isthmus connecting North and South America should be commenced as soon as possible. He advocates the civil service laws and stauds for meiit as the chief recommendation in making appointments. He desires liberal appropriations for the National Museum and the Zoological Park, and speaks favorably of the fairs at Charleston and St. Louis. The President concludes his message with the declaration that "we are at peace with the nations of mankind, and we firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual respect and good will."

An oration was delivered by Chauncey M. Depew. The exposition will continue until May 1. A. J. Snell wanted to attend a party, but was afraid to do so on account of pains in his stomach, ?hich he feared would grow worse. He says, "I was telling my troubles to a lady friend, who said: 'Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy will put you in condition for the party.' I bought a bottle and take pleasure in stating that two doses cured me and enabled me to have a good time at the party." Mr. Snell is a resident of Summer Hill, X. Y.

OA8TOHIA. B?an /j The Kind You Haw Always Bought Notes From Nearby. Some pretty heavy investments are being made in limestone lands in Berkeley county. The Henry A. PofTenberger farm of 138 acres, near St. James, Washington county, was sold to Jacob Friend for j>75 per acre. John W. Rohr, a former resident of Jefferson county, died recently in Lynchburg, Va., aged 72 years. He was a gallant Confederate soldier. A number of Martinsburg business men will form a syndicate and buy lands in Berkeley county for the purpose of planting immense apple orchards. Mr. William D. Webster and Miss Lucy May Brown, both of Charles Town, were married at the home of the bride in that place last Thursday by Rev. Dr. S. K. Cox. John Shryock, a well-known citizen of Berryville and an old Confederate soldier, died last week, aged 69 years. Mrs. Michael Crow, of the same place, died at the age of 60 years. Burns Brothers have purchased of Mrs. Martha C. Davenport, at the price of $1,600, the timber on about forty acres of the "Altona" farm borderiug along the Charles Town and Summit Point road.?Spirit. The Thomas Rowland farm, situated near Summit Point, has been sold by ^ ^ ir an * von ntnr t r\ C71 a r If JL ?J. iiaiucoij , ac i/Avvuw* , ? H. Purcell, of Frederick county, Va. The farm contains 168 acres and was bought for $4,536 cash. The wedding of Lula M. Good and John F. Dunn, of Hagerstown, set for Saturday night, did not take place. When Duun did not appear Saturday night the prospective bride went to see him, and he said he was not ready to get married. Miss Good went home and became hysterical. It is believed that an attempt was made last Sunday night to wreck a Baltimore and Ohio excursion train which was returning from Winchester to Baltimore. A large rock was found on the track a short distance from Charles Town. The train had about ten coaches full of people returning to Baltimore and Washington. Mr. Wm. F. Compher, of Frederick, Md., and Miss Bertie M. McLaughlin, daughter of Mrs. Isabella McLaughlin, of Charles Town, were married on Thursday, November 28, 1901, at the parsonage of Calvary M. E. Church South, Baltimore, by Rev. J. P. Stump. Mr. and Mrs. Compher will make their futuie home in Frederick.?Spirit. At Hagerstown the jury in the case of Frank Rinehart, tried for causing the death of Miss Finfrock by upsetting a boat in Lake Royer, near PenMar, after being out 41 hours, were unable to agree. Judge Stake discharged them. The State's Attorney stetted the case and it will probably not be tried again. Reinhart goes free, but he had a good soare and paid pretty dearly for his foolhardy exploit. A New Year's Guide. There is one book every one should make au etrort to get, for the new year.

HOME AND CHILD Does your horse "feel his oats"? What a difference between the grain-fed and the rrrass-fed horse! The first O strong and full of ginger, the second flabbv, weak and tired out before he begins. The feeding makes the difference. Children arc not alike either. One is rosy, bright-eyed, full of life and laughter, another is pale, weak and dull. The fecding again is responsible. Sickly children need special feeding. They don't "feel their oats". Scott's Emulsion adds just the right richness to their diet. It is like grain to the horse. The child gets new y\ /-? d 1 /Yf*f f 1 AM aim aiiuiii^ ui^tauuu, Scott's Emulsion is more than food.

A new $40,000 hotel is to be built j. at Grafton. z A fire at Fairmont last Saturday burned the theatre and several other buildings. Rev. Eugene Douglass, pastor of the Presbyterian church at Princeton, died last week of typhoid fever. There are 9G5 inmates of the Hospital for the Insane at Weston. Last Thursday 145 big turkeys were provided for their thanksgiving dinner, besides other things in proportion. In Randolph county the other day i while hunting deer John Kelley shot and wounded a stag. The animal turned on him and knocked him down and might have killed him had he not been rescued by others in the party. Kelley was quite badly hurt. Announcement will soon be made ^ by the Norfolk and Western Railroad ? -? ' * 1 I Company that its management naa completed a deal for the acquisition of the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company, the recently formed $40,- j 000,000 trust owning extensive bitu- t minous coal lands in Virginia and 8 West Virginia along the line of the E railroad. The Norfolk and Western ^ will control, through a projected sub- ? sidiary company, over 300,000 acres g of valuable coal lands. Approximately 1 $20,000,000 will be involved in the t deal. This is the sum which the ? Pocahontas Company wants for the i control of the coal and coke lands 1 which it recently acquired, and tLi^ t is the sum which the representatives of the Norfolk and Western have ( agreed to pay. To acquire control of t the lands which the railway corpora- 1 tion allowed to slip out of its control ? it will have to pay a profit of about ^ $6,000,000 to the Pocahontas Company. f r * I Last Thursday was truly a day of 1 thanksgiving for Mrs.Elizabeth Stocks, a poor widow of Lazearville, W. Va. | Two weeks previous the little home of Mrs. Stocks was destroyed by lire. , | She had no insurance and was without Z means to rebuild.
