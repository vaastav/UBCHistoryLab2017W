DELEGATE CANNON was visited by an inter viewer recently and shot off a few opinions. These were to the effect t.iat he did not ex pect any legislation at this session hostile to polygamy. Ho is, however, fearful that the protest of the non-Mormon women of Utah will have some effeot. He knows how it is himself. "When a woman will she will, you may depend on't." HE New York World computes the State* municipal and railroad debts of the whole country at the enormous sum of $20,000,- 000,000. Estimating the average rate of in terest at six per cent., we find that a sum equal to the entire national debt is paid out for interest every year and a half. A pretty round sum, to be sure bnt then, debts are sometimes blessings in disguise. AFIEB a long-continued and adroit manip ulation of the Austrian chambers, Count Andrassy has finally succeeded in overcom ing the opposition to his policy in occupy ing Bosnia, and securing the adoption of his estimates by the committee on budget. The ohange of ministry, therefore, which has been so long impending, will not take place, and for a time, at least, Andrassy is monarch of all he surveys. THEY, were "only negro roustabouts," and therefore were only worth a single line in the dispatch chronicling the loss of the steam er Cotton Valley near Donaldsonville, on the Mississippi river. There were twelve or fifteen of them, but a line in the newspapers was all they were worth. It makes no dif ference that they may have had wives and children, who would feel their loss as keenly aa.if they wore while akins. But that is the way of the world. E. SCHUHZ is determined to make a vigor ous fight against the army officers who have, he claims, maligned the administration of the Indian bureau. He again comes to th charge and demands of Gens. Sherman and Sheridan full proofs of the charges they have made, and alleges that they have grossly perverted the facts in the oase. It is very evident that the army officers will not have such an easy job of effecting the transfer of the Indian bureau to the war department as they supposed they would have. HB American newspapers are abusing our Canadian brethren for the flunkeyism, mani fested by the reception of the Marquis of Lome and the Princess Louise. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. It may be within the recollection of some of the writers that there was considerable toady ism, and that of the most despicable sort, when the Prince of Wales made a tour on this side of the border a few years ago. Mankind in general seem to lose their wits in the presence of royalty. IT is very evident that Mr. Linderman's official career is about at an end. The Re publicans have determined that he must step down and out of the United States mint to make room for some one more de voted to the interepts of the party. They hint at grave charges to be preferred against him, but this is only an excuse for his re moval, his real sin being that he appointed good Democrats to positions in his gilt. That, in the eyes of Eepublicans, is an un pardonable sin, and the Senate, at least, does not propose to condone it. W E are glad to see that the. Princess Louise has taken the advice of the GLOBE, and gone to the rescue of her husband. We pointed out the fact that the marquis was likely to be overtaxed being called upon to respond to so many addresses, and suggested that the Princess, who is noted lor her fine mental acquirements, ought to take a part of the burden from his shoul ders. She has accepted the suggestion in good part, and on Saturday acted upon it by responding in a very graceful manner to an address from the ladies of the Montreal Ed ucational society. THERE is promise of concerted action be tween the governments of Italy, Russia and Germany looking towards the suppression of the International societies, that now so seriously threaten the governments. Act ing together they can, no doubt, make it de cidedly uncomfortable for these malcontents, who will be glad to escape from out the bor ders of the countries. Spain, too, is taking active measures iu the same direction, and soon there will be no spot on which the weary International can rest his foot. It will be a good riddance to bad rubbish. IN a speech at Paris on Sunday, at a meet ing attended by distinguished Frenchmen and Americans, Senator Fourcher de Cariel said: "Americans are our seniors in liberty but they lack one of the most precious boons, namely, the liberty of commerce." The senator spoke a truth which we on this side of the Atlantic can fully appreciate. In a country whioh ought to command the commerce of the world, our trade is re stricted by reason of the high protective tariff imposed on imports, while France and England, with almost absolute free trade, have substantially taken possession of the commerce of the whole world. The most precious of boons is truly the liberty of com merce. 1 THE TBTJE OBJECT OF THE CONTEST. The Republican papers endeavor to con vey the impression that the contest for Washburn's seat is a mere question whether it shall be held by Washburn or Donnelly. It is perhaps natural that this view should be taken in that quarter, but we are sur prised that so intelligent a Demooratio jour nal as the Faribault Democrat should fall into the same train. Though Donnelly and Washburn are the agencies used, the real contest is for a free, honest, untrammeled ballot. The corrup tion in this district was shameless and noto rious. It began months before the nomina tion and extended to the election. Republicans and Democrats-were bought and sold like sheep in the shambles. There is no con cealment of this fact among Republicans. The lowest estimate which well informed Republicans place upon Mr. Washburn's ex penditure is twenty-five thousand dollars, and many Republicans declare that it ex ceeded thirty thousand dollars. Every one understands that there was no legitimate ex penditure of any such sum. In addition to absolute bribery and pur chase, there were the most glaring frauds perpetrated in colonizing men from Wiscon sin, Dakota, and also from the Second Dis trict. There were the infamous frauds in Kittson county where 183 votes were returned for Washburn, and two for Donnelly, not one of which were legal. Railroad men, half-breeds and Canadians were voted, the election being held in a box car on the track, and the polls moved about at will. If it had been necessary, 500 votes would have been, returned instead of 183. Iu fact, there is no limit to this' unblushing rascality and never will be until some ex ample is made of the perpetrators. For, at least, the second time the nomination and election in this district has been secured by the shameless means we have indicated. If this is al lowed to continue unrebuked, it will always be done, and it will be the utmost farce for the Democrats to attempt a cam paign for any one. They may put forth all the honest efforts possible, they may convert men by the thousand, but when the returns come in they will find the record against them regardless of the vote. Mr. Donnelly is rendering a public service by making a contest which will expose and break up these iniquities. He is justly entitled to the seat. Whether Mr. Donnelly is liked personally, or politically, all honest men, of whatever po litical faith should rejoice to see Washburn unseated and disgraced. In no other way can the rotten system which he relies on for political renown be rebuked. It is not necessary to prove three thou sand individual illegal votes to unseat Wash burn. "Fraud vitiates the contract," and that can be proven overwhelmingly. Those who imagine that there is something strange or peculiar in this contest are mistaken. There is an almost exactly similar contest in Pennsylvania, and in New York a contest is being made on the ground that a man bought his nomination, though he is not charged with the improper use of money in securing the election. It is claimed that a man can be unseated for bribery in the nominating convention, as well as at the polls. If this rule was applied to Wash burn, how long does any one suppose he could hold his seat? If the people of this district tamely submit to such outrages as the recent election showed were perpetrated on the ballot box, it is a farce to attempt any more elections. There i3 every reason why Mr. Washburn should be exposed, dis graced and driven into private life. MR. *AYES' MESSAGE. Mr. R. B. Hayes, a citizen of Ohio who, by sufferance of the people of the United States, holds the office of President, yester day submitted his annual message to Con gress. It is not a document of exceptional length, nor yet of exceptional brilliancy, and were it not for the fact that it emanates from a person holding a high official position, it would command little attention. The portion that, probably, will attract the most notice and provoke the most dis cussion is that which relates to the recent elections in the South. The public has been informed time and again for the past three months that Mr. Hayes had taken, or was about to take, a new departureto flaunt anew the bloody shirt let slip the dogs of warand again fan the flames of sectional strife. This expectation has not been realized as far as the message goes. It is true he alludes to rumors to the effect that in some parts of the Union colored men have been deprived of the full liberty of the franchise, but he does not state it as a fact of his own personal knowl edge or even as a matter substantiated by trustworthy information. He merely alludes to the matter to urge upon Congress, which is the exclusive judge of the qualifications and election of its own members, such ex amination into the conduct of the elections "as may be appropriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats." At the same time he says he con ceives it to be his duty, as President of the United States, to inquire into any violations of law that may be committed, and to punish the perpetrators, on conviction, in an exemplary manner. With these suggestions and this determination no reasonable man can find fault. The
