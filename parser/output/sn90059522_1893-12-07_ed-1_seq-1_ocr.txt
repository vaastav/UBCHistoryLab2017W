V OL. XV.. SCORED BY SENATORS Grover Severely Rapped by Hoar, Sherman and Hill. SENATE HAS BEEN SLIGHTED. Unanimous Call for the Ha waiian Correspondence. CONGRESS MUST KNOW ALL. Attempt to Restore Lii an In- suit to Congress IS THE OHIO SENATOR'S IDEA. Washington. Dec. 6.— A spirited discussion of the Hawaiian question occupied the senate today. The debate arose over the resolution offered yester day by Mr. Hoar (Rep., Mass.) request ing the president to forward to the senate all the correspondence on the Hawaiian question. * Mr. Hoar said the resolution covered the period of three administrations, and he hoped and believed that the instructions would show a settled and consistent policy, certainly down to a recent time, in re gard to which there had been no party or political difference of opinion, if the president's message meant any thing, it meant that the president was meditating the question whether he should by his own executive authority commit an act of war against a friendly power. If what was apparently pro posed to be done had not been done yet, Mr. Hoar desired that the swift and Indignant remonstrance of the Amer ican people .should make itself felt aud heard. The president was getting into the habit of adopting rather extraordinary language in his dealings with the other branches of the government. . Mr. Mills. (Dem.. Tex.) opposed the resolution, It called for information, but meanwhile its author (Hoar) pro ceeded to "shell the woods" before he got that information and charged the president with meditating an act of war. He (Mills) denied that statement; on the contrary, the executive had re spectfully submitted; the question to congress and given them the information a. his disposal, such as he thought ap propriate to submit in his message. • r ■ ; THE 

PRESIDENT'S ACTION in the matter had been strictly, confined within the limits of executive authority. The only -. question presented was, did the United States government interfere and overturn the existing government of Hawaii? If it did, it was the duty of the people of the United States repre sented in the government to make res titution and reinstate the government which they had overthrown. . Mr. Mills asserted that the entire Ha waiian difficulty had arisen because the sugar planters of Hawaii wanted to ob tain the bounty on sugar to be paid to them out of the pockets of American citizens.- r" 1 , ;J--- ° ; It was not in the president's power, continued Mr. " Mills, to wage war against Hawaii, and he had not claimed that it was within his ' power. But whatever power ' the president had in his hands he had exercised. The ab sorption of the islands by the United States was perhaps only -a question of time, but if that was to come to pass he hoped it would be done decently and in order. Mr. Vilas (Dem., Wis.) thought there were reasons why the resolutions should not be adopted at this time. The presi dent, in his message, had said that ad ditional advices were soon expected, and when received would be promptly sent to congress, accompanied by a special message. He referred to the remarks of Mr. Hoar as to the reported action of the president being AN ACT OF WAR, and asked whether the landing of troops to overthrow the government by virtue of their force was not an act of war. Mr. Hoar replied that there was no pretense that there was any act of force or of war. The troops were landed un der the allegation that; they were to be used to protect the lives and property of' the American citizens. Mr. Aldrich (Rep., Pv. I.) asked Mr. Vilas why the president should not take the public into confidence, but the Wisconsin senator declined to be di verted by such a question. Mr. Vilas said that Mr. Hoar was begging the question. Mr. Hoar then continued, saying that the queen yielded to armed insurrec tion and not to the American troops. "What Information has the gentle man from Massachusetts," asked Mr. Gray, "that there was any armed Insur rection on the lfith of January?" , "The statements of Mr. Stevens and the provisional government," replied Mr. Hoar. "There is not a bit of evidence of that," declared Mr. .Gray. "I think there Is," asserted Mr. Hoar. After the president had sent a letter addressed to "My great and good brother, President Dole," it would be an act of infamy only equaled by THE ACT OF JO AH when he stabbed his neghbor under the fifth rib and then asKed, "Art thou in good health, my bi other?"' [Laugh ter.] Mr. Vilas protested that that was not the question. Mr. Hoar replied that tho whole argu ment of the senator from Wisconsin and the senator from Texas was one that would require the DnltoJ State, to give back Texas lo Mexico today.* "We never got Texas*' from >iexioo," said Mr. Mills. "Texas came into the Union voluntarily." Mr. Vilas declared that Mr. Hear fti-J from the defense of his own proposition. Without going into the question ut the character of th_ instruction"! of the president to iiis minister, Mr. VilM de dared that what the resident ha.l iii itructed the mlni-tir to do he: had imple, complete. and perfect authority to do. "How do you know?" came from half l dozen senators at once. Mr. Yllas Buoyed that the resolution J be referred to the committee on foreign relations. . Mr. Hill (Dem., N.Y.) said he did not propose to cross the Hawaiian bridge till he reached it, nor did he intend to discuss the wisdom of the original pro cedure or of what had been done re cently by the present administration. He seldom agreed, he said, with what the ' senator from Massachusetts stated, but -* - XXX ' ...HE DID. 

AGREE with him that this was a simple resolu- tion asking for information trom a de partment of the government iii refer ence to a most ' important matter. In formation which he thought the Aiuer- .'.. icau people wauted to know from the president's message and were disap pointed when it was not given to them. It had been said, continued Mr. Hill, that instructions had been given— he did not say so, however, and he hoped it was not true— from which it was in ferred that force i might be used to re store the previously existing status. That brought up the question whether the administration had the power with out the consent of congress to use the army or navy to restore the previously existing condition of affairs, even con ceding that the government had been planted by fraud or even by- force. There were three departments of this government ana the executive depart ment was but one of them. There was reason why this information should be given now. Perhaps at this moment, possibly at this very hour, the Davy of the United States, co-operating* with the United States minister, was seeking to destroy the provisional government by force, and \ that was a question the propriety of which should be pi iii 

DETERMINED BY CONGRESS. Mr. Sherman' (Rep. O.) favored the passage of the resolution. He said he aid not intend now to j say a word in re gard to the condition of affairs existing which existed in Hawaii a year ago. The difficulty was that the - president and the newspapers say that there is a purpose to restore the queen, to renew the status quo, to set aside what was re garded by the administration as an un- ** lawful act. These were" all .igatters of controversy. But there was one , thing which appeared to him to be very plain, and that was that the congress of the United States had not been treated in the open and fair way in which an ad ministration, a part of the government of the United States, should treat con gress. It was certain that the doubt about the condition of affairs which ex isted in Hawaii a year ago were in the mind of the president when the present congress met in extraordinary session, It was certain that .a . gentle man of. high standing, no doubt, a former member of the house, had been sent to Haiwaii. for the. pur pose of. acquiring information. It was also certain that the administration had formed a certain , definite Idea- of its duties, and it had been stated practically that it was the purpose "of: the "adminis tration to restore" the status that existed before the revolution, to put the queen iii power again, and congress ; had not been informed of it. The president of the United States and the executive officers of the government might as well understand -that the people of ..the United States ':•. . ' .*.;"•' XXyyjJDIDNOT 

LIKE THIS. v . ■ This was a feature of the controversy which impressed itself I upon the minds of the plainest people of the country. Whatever might be ; the ideas or the ;\ ; information of the president ought to be conveyed to the public at large; pot only to congress, but also to the people. There was no reason in the world for secrecy. All the facts out to be com municated to congress. "*. .'.';**-;/ "XXii . Mr. Sherman said that all he desired to say on the present occasion was that if it was the purpose/of the president, by the use of . the military force, to re store the queen in Hawaii, .it J would be a fatal act of public policy, a great injustice to the people of the United States and almost an insult to congress. The congress was the lawmaking power. The president had no right to declare war or to do ah' act of ."war, or to pre cipitate 1 the country, into a controversy . of this kind, It' seemed to him, said Mr. Sherman, that not only the informa tion called for by the resolution, but all the information available should havo been communicated to congress at its last session. Then congress might have acted and the public might have been prepared for the present -X 

CONDITION OF AFFAIRS. If there .had been less secrecy and more open-handed and fair dealing, there would have been less suspicion and less trouble. If it should happen, continued Mr. Sherman, that in pursu ance of the authority of the executive, American troops should be landed in Hawaii and blood should be shed and a single life lost, it would be. by an un lawful act. Whatever view was taken of the action of a year ago, there would be no doubt about, the view that would be taken by the people of the United States of any act now which involves violence, or even the appearance of vio lence, or threats, or any act whatever to be done by the executive authority, without the consent or the knowledge of congress. \ ... — . -:•- Mr. Gray (Dem., Del.) agreed with Mr. Sherman that there was no objec tion to the adoption of the resolution. . . Mr. Frye (Rep., Me.) spoke of the high character of ex-Minister Stevens, and declared the readiness of himself and his colleague (Mr. Hale) to defend him ; against any attacks" that might bo made | upon hun. Mr. Call (Dem., Fla.) closed the de bate, and then the resolution was adopted without a division. After a short executive . session the senate, at 4:05 o'clock, adjourned until tomorrow.

Missouri, but, Illinois-, -by- resolution -of its legislature, decided that his statue should be one of the two which is en titled to place in Statuary hall. Illinois, therefore, had the chief place in today's ceremonies, but Missouri and Minne sota also took advantage of the oppor tunity to do especial honor to the mem ory of their soldier of by-gone days. Ap propriate ceremonies and addresses by representatives" of the three states named marked the unveiling ot the statue. The ceremonies began at 1 o'clock with -/ a " small street / ' pa rade, which" was an incident rather than a feature ,of i the -occasion. A troop of cavalry from Fort Myer - and the artillery band stationed this/city escorted- the speakers and guests from the Metropolitan hotel to the capitol. Following the military in car riages were Gov. - Altgeld /{and X staff. of Illinois; Gov. Nelson "'arid /staff, of Minnesota; Gov. Stone and staff, of Missouri ; the members of the Shields' statue commission; the family of gen. shields; the committee of "arrangements, and the executive committee. Veterans of the Mexican war, members of the G. A. R. and of the Emmett guards, of this city, brought up the rear of. the procession, which moved to the capitol . The exercises at the capitol began at 1:30, when Mr. Springer, presented to the house the formal resolution accept ing the statue on behalf. of the congress of the United. States. In advocating this, Mr. Springer, in a brief speech, re viewed the life" of / Gen. Shields, and paid a glowing tribute to his noble qual ities. 'XyiXX '. Gen. John C. Black followed. In the course of his remarks, Gen. Black J said: "The statue is .to stand/ through the ages for which the capitoi may endure as a type chosen by our great state of its best citizenship. The state as you cross it is an album where shine the names of /Joliet, the devout, of La Salle, the chevalier, of Marquette, tbe earnest, and of a whole host of shadowy and' heroic characters. - In the seventy-five years since ' our constitution was adopted, our bar and our courts have been thronged with wise and brilliant advocates and judges. Illinois glories in her sons, living and dead, and from them all she has named the dauntless Shields, her citizen, : her soldier, her senator and her judge; not that he is greatest of all, but that in addition to his public career he stood for/the broad est catholicity of American citizen ship." ■ y ■ - - Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, Mr. Bland, of Missouri, and , MR. HALL, OF MINNESOTA, also paid feeling tributes to the mem ory of the man upon whom such dis tinguished honor, was conferred today. Col. Oates, the one-armed Confed erate veteran, threw a flavor of per sonal reminiscence into the proceedings by arising at tho close of . the set speeches In The house. He apologized for intruding, . but / as -/a . .derate" veteran under Stonewall Jackson, who had met Gen. Shields on the ■'. field of . battle at Fort Republic, he said he/ could not refrain from saying a few words. He declared that no soldier ever fought more bravely ,or gallantly than Shields /at Port .Republic. //' H e. honored him *as highly as : if \he had fought on his own side. / While the * orations/were being deliv ered the committee on arrangements entered the house, and at the conclusion the members of the house and the vis itors filed/ out ' to Statuary hall, where J the unveiling of the ; monument; took "place. // 'X-jXf '/■' '** '-/. /'/.'■ Mr. Condon, of Chicago, delivered' a' long address in eulogy of Shields.

It now transpires that he wrote a message to the Globe the day before f his tragic death, and undoubtedly had intended to kill himself that day. His letter is ALBERT WOLFF. ,dated . . Nov; 24, but he^first"" wrote "Sept.," and erased it by a stroke of his pen, writing "Nov." above. The. only significance of this is that it shows that : the month when he ceased to work was; uppermost in his mind. The letter is a most touching production, arid " shows J no sign of Insanity, but indicates a dis tress which cannot but awaken pity.
