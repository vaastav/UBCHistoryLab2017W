ttkeklp tribune. ED. BORCHEEDT, filter I Fillister. THDESD4.T, DEO. 6, 1877. The annual message of President Hayes to Congress was delivered on Monday and was the longest similar document submitted in the past sixteen years. Th* President is outspoken on the financial question, n garding as pre eminent the policy and measures which are designed to secure the restoration of the currency to a normal and healthful condition, amf believes that the resump tion cf specie payments is the one thing necessary to settle the disturbed condi tion of our finances and aecnre the pros perity of the country. He also recom mends the issue of silver currency in limited quantities and of a value as nearly equal to gold as possible. Of his Southern policy he speaks at consider able length and regards the results fol lowing as very encouraging. He says ; “No unprejudiced mind will deny that the fatal collisions which for several years have been o * frequent occurrence, und have alarmed the public minds, have almost entirely ceased ; and that a spirit of mutual forbearance and hearty nation al interest has succeeded. There has been a general re-establishment of order and of the orderly administration of justice. Instances of remaining law lessness have become of rare occurrence; political turmoil and turbulence have disappeared ; useful industries have been resumed ; public credit iu the Southern States has been greatly strengthed, and the encouraging benefit of a revival of commerce between the sections of the country lately embroiled in civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are some of the results already obtained, upon which the country is to be con gratulated. They are of such impor tance that wa may with confidence patiently await the desired consumma tion that will surely come with the natural progress of events.” The pro tection of the rights of the colored peo ple ar justly demanded and lie urges the prompt punishment of all who at tempt to oppress them. Asa whole the message ia an able document and gives the people a clear idea of his objects and intentions, showing him to be a patriot and statesman who is doing what he ain cerely believes to bo for the best inter ests of the whole country, and while there may be a difference of opinion as to the wisdom of hi* policy, we believe that there is safety in standing by him and bringing his measures to a fall and thorough test. The ultra silver and greenback men have claimed that the demonetization of the silver dollar in 1873 was a contrac tion of the currency. The claim, of course, is absurd, since if the whole amount of American silver dollars coined from the beginning of the government up to that time had then been in circu lation the contraction would have been uueppreciable. The entire coinage of sil ver dollars by our mints from 1792 to 1853, was out $3,038,000; and from 48i>3 to 1873 the total amount coined was 35.492.838, making an aggregale of only 38.045.838. These figures sre taken from the report of Secretary Sherman, a id are no donbt correct. The President’s message to Congress is an interesting document and is un usually valuable in dealing with the Southern policy and the reforms which have formed bo large a part of Republi can platforms and so small a part of Re publican practice. On the money ques tion the President is firm. He is de cidedly favorable to resumption—and advocate* the payment of the bonds is sued prior to 1873 in gold. Evidently ho does not favor the remonetization of silver, but will sign s silver bill which exempts the payment of the bonds in that coin. These portions of the docu ment will bo read with interest. — Sen tinel. Thebe are all manner of stories out about Senator Blaine’s condition, repre sentingjhim in every shade of health from complete convalesenco to hopeless de cay. The opinion which prev tils among those moat likely to know, in Washing ton, is that the Senator, under his ma larial attack, felt the need of a complete relief from care; and having stuck to it, under all manner of temptation, is now nearly restored to health and vigor. Both the president and the secretary think that it would be wise to repeal the match tax, the tax on savings banks de posits, and some other small and an noying taxes, and substitute a moderate duty on tea and coffee. They both give strong reasons for this change, but we doubt whether the two houses of con gress will have the moral courage to lest it. The ordinary revenues from all re sources into the United States Treasury for the year ending June 30, 1877, were §266,000,586, and the ordinary expendi tures was §238,660,008, leaving a sur plus revenue of §30,310,537, which was consumed iu redemption of United States notes and bonds, and the increase of the cash balance in tho Treasury. The estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending Jan. 30, 1878, is §265,500,- 000, and the expenditures at §232,430,- 613. New York Tkibvxe: The apparent causes for discouragement are tather en couraging than otherwise. The dispo sition of the Southern question has re moved one cause of offence against Re publicans, and destroyed so much Democratic capital. The President’s honest efforts to improve tho Civil Ser vice remove another ground of com complaint, and leaves Democracy bank rupt. Anil as for the Democratic as cendancy iu Congress, wo look upon it os the best thing that could happen. It gives an opportunity to disclose their real purpose and character to the coun try. Nothing more is needed to insure their defeat. the whole. Democrats may as well postpone dis counting their coming success for a lit tle while, it is too much in doubt to warrant premature exultation on their part or unnecessary sadness on the part of Republicans, A Monster Vessel.—Tlie largest steamship, ezcepfc the Great Eastern, ever built, is now moored to the wharf of the French Steamship Company, North Hirer, New York. She is named the Hooper, and lias heretofore been used in the lying of telegraph ct hies. This is her first trip to this country. She was built at Newcastie-ou-Tyue in 1873, and is classed 100A1 r.t Lloyds. She is 350 feet over all, 55 broad, and 3G deep, built of iron, and rigged as a three m isted schooner. She is registered as 4,935 tons, bat has a capacity of 6,000 tons exclusive of passengers. She has two compound inverted engines of 400 nominal horse power, built by T. Clark it Cos., of Newcastle, and is fitted with steam windlass, winches, crane, and bal last, and donkey engines. In her are three cable tanks, one forty-one feet in diameter and thirty feet deop, another fifty-three by thirty feet. In the centre one there have been stored 57,'K)0 bush els of corn. In the spaces between these tanka she has room for 400 tons of freight. She will carry out the largest cargo that ever left any port in the United States. On board of her are all the means and apurtenances for the lay ing of cables. She is manned by a crew of 100 men, and will be opou to inspec tion to-morrow. Tun Northern Democratic editor has not yet found time to comment on that vote of the solid South for the repeal of the Resumption Act. It is a pretty large and meaty subject, and the more it is examined the uglier it looks for the Democratic party. The country cannot look, except with alarm, upon the spec tacle of the controlling element of a par ty which has a prospect of getting pos session of the Government voting as one man for incipient repudiation. And when back of this vote there is plainly visible another one just as unanimous for a whoDsale raid on the Treasury, the most generous friend of the South must admit that implicit trust of a sec tion which develops such dangerous proclivities, is not the safe or the patri otic course at this time.—AT. Y. Tri bune. New York has a baby weighing one pound and ten ounces. Its name is Collins, and the Graphic describes: The child, a girl, was born last Sunday, and weighs one pound and ten ounces, while its length is thirteen and a half in ches, about that of a good sized loaf of bread. It is well proportioned, al- I though it would be stretched a point to I call it handsome. Its head is not as large as a Havana orange, and is cov ered by dark hair, while its complexion is also very dark. The little creatures eyes are ahvaj’s shut, and its breathing can hardly be heard, even in closest proximity. The hands are very narrow, long and bony, looking more like the ( claws of a bird than the hands of a hu -1 man being. The South Carolina Legislature has shown the depth of Democratic ingrati tude. While Patterson is sticking to that party iu the Senate with all his ad hesive power, and is working like a slave to put it in control, the Democrat ic Legislature of his State comes to gether and receives a report on the mat ter of his election. This shows that about twenty members of the Legisla ture which elected him say they were offered money to vote for him, and re fused it; about twenty were offered money, and took it, making forty pur chases which Mr. Patterson diner at tempted or accomplished. Mr. Patter son wants “a white man’s chance.” He seems to have made the most of it a good while ago. By a letter from Mr. O. B. Green to Hon. Isaac Stepheson, written last Monday, we learn that at that date a space of 1,500 feet separated the dredges working on the two ends of the Sturgeon Bay canal. The dredges will be kept at work as lona aa tnn itliur will per mit. The engineer appointed by the ! state reports that the second quarter of i the work has been finished, and some work on the third quarter. As soon as I his report is made to tiie governor, the ; canal company will be enable to secure [ that portion of the grant securing to it \ under the law, and will make arrange ! meats for selling it and devote the pro ! eeeds towards completing the canal.— i Marinette Ragle. A beautiful young heiress in Mos cow has married a beggar eighty-sis years old. It has a queer look at first but nothing could be more natural. The young girl—she is only twenty-two— could not enter into possession of her fortune until she was married, and the young men whom her guardians intro duced to her were empty-headed crea tures, to whom she was unwilling to bind herself to life; so sh r■•- '.ved to marry an old beggar and , at money without sacrificing her i dependence. The old man was one of her pensioners, and readily consented to marry her and then keep out of her way, retiring on a comfortable allowance. All the beggars in town feasted and made merry on the wedding night. _ Tna suspension bridge from New jTork to Brooklyn was a great undertak ing, will cost a vast sum of money, and, when done, must be of incalculable benefit to both cities; but the tunnel ex tending for more than two miles under the Hudson from New York to Jersy City, through which may pass all the passenger trains from the North, South and West which wish to enter the former city, will, when complet ed, bo of still greater benefit to the traveling public. It is to be wide enough for a double track railroad and a street car track also. It will be com pleted in three years. The Senate Gothamites are now greatly exercised with a fear that their city will be entirely dug up and over turned, as shovelera came upon a huge whisky still soma five feet below the surface, in full operation. Heavy boots now come down lightly, lest the jar crack the crust and their owners sink through the street into a sour mash. About a year since a still was found in the room just back of the pulpit in a Missouri enroll in which services were held every Sunday. If people did not lock around so much they would not find whisky distilleries iu such ' unex pected places. The nrblie debt statement for No vember shows a decrease of §1,323,634, and the following balances iu the treasury: Currency, §8,816,396; special fund fox redemption of fractional cur rency, §9,803,002; special deposits of legal tenders for redemption of certi ficates of deposits, §36,055,000; coin, §133,970,214, including coin certificates, §32,291,400: out standing legal tenders. §351,340,388; amount due military es tablishments, §4,500,000. That most loathsome and terrible of all diseases, the leprosy mentioned by the historians of Bible times, has been discovered in many factories iu Rhode Island, its victims being Prench- Cauadians fr -in Tracadia, near the Gulf of St. Lawn nee. Near and in that old settlement, leprosy has existed for near ly two hundred years, the younger peo ple now and then escaping to ocher lo calities to finally die with and spread the subtle disease. A max by the name of Marsh of Uni ty, while hunting one day fast week, was mistaken by his brother for a deer ! and fired at, the ball passing through one ankle and entering the other, which will 1 possibly result in the loss of one if not both feet. Singular as it may seem to the Re publican politicians, the people actually like to see a President with a mind of his own, and not afraid to assert it in behalf of what he believes to be right. And if he is brave enough to step over the party lines when, in his opinion, the public good demands it, they like him all the better.— St. Louis Republican. Resumption is nothing more than bringing greenbacks up to par with gold, and it would seem that, to facilitate the work, the Government ought to hon or its promises on every possible oc casion. It ought to abolish all distinc tions made by itself between the two, and accept greenbacks in payment of nil debts due to itself. — St. Louis Re publican. The recent earthquake in V estern lowa and Eastern Nebraska was either a very great shake-up or the people of those localities are very great liars. On the farm of .1. H. Armstrong a half acre of ground, say the natives, was torn and tossed, leaving vast fissures which still exist, some filled with water and some open and of unknown depth. Thebe comes a report, couched in very grave language, that Susan B. An thony was elected a constable iu Colorado at tho recent election. The selection seems to have been a wise one, as the man who runs away from any woman who is not his wife, is seldom found. “Honors are easy” in South Caro lina’s representation in tho Senate; it consists of a carpet bagger and a native Democrat, the former under indictment for buying hia election, and the latter for participating in a massacre of ne groes. A stiff-backed resumption paragraph in the President’s message would be of more benefit to the Republican party than a whole graveyard full of resur rected Old Line Whigs.—V. V. Tribune Discoursing upon Thanksgiving Goo. Peck remarks that “the rich as a general thing do tho eating, while the poor do the thanksgiving praying.” The proposition to divide California into two States, with Los Angles as the capital of the southern half, is again re newed on the Pacific coast. A government dispatch from Havana says John Welsh, Minister to England, does own slaves in Cuba. Thu anti resumption party will be ready for its obituary when the Presi dent s Message hits it. The cashier of the First National Bank of Lafayette, lud., stole 357,000, and the Bank has suspended. The gravity of the situation at Ver sailles is rather increasing than decreas ing. The extra session of Congress termi nated at noon Monday. JVew iSdvcrtiscmcnis.

TRUMAN & MORSE.' THE INTER OCEAN FOR 1878. THREE EDITIONS. WEEKLY, SEMI-WEEKLY AND DAILY. In making its seventh annual announcement The Inter-Ocean reassures its readers and the public generally of its taith in the Republican party and its devotion to Republican principles. Its record during the past year has made it more than ever before the great representa tion Republican paper of the country. The value of such a paper and its influence for good were never more apparent than during the electoral complications of last fall and win ter. The course of the Inter-Ocean during that trying period won for it the admiration and lasting friendship of Republicans everywhere. As an exponent of true Republicanism, to which the public turned for advice and for en couragement. The Inter-Ocean stood through out the momentous struggle without a peer. There never was a time when Republicans more needed a journal stenefast and true than now. Never before, in the history of the country, has there been a period of such poli tical interest and inquiry as is now in the im mediate future. Great questions are to be dis cussed and disposed of ; embarrassing compli cations arc to be grappled with ; fundamental principles are to be defended. Republican to the core. The inter Ocean will give all possi ble information on all political topics, and, while treating opponents with the greatest fairness, will maintain its high standing as an earnest and outspoken advocate of uncompro mising and unadulterated Republicanism. While The Inter-Ocean stands second to no paber In the country as a political journal, it takes high rank as an enterprising and thor oughgoing newspaper. During the past year It lias eclipsed till Western papers iu the excel lence, completeness, and reliability of its for eign dispatches and letters, and has had few equals in presenting in most readable shape general and home news. In every part of the world great events are occurring, with proba bilities pointing to more important in future. Never before was a good newspaper so impor tant to both young and old. In atl that goes to make a first cla s news paper, The Inter-Ocean is not excelled by any 1 publication in the country. It is a national newspaper, one that will be found useful and interesting to Americans in every pari of the globe. While it especially represents the great interests of the Northwest, it is national in its views and comprehensive in its gathering. The lutcr-Ocean makes especial claim as a family paper, devoting more attention than any other political newspaper to departments prepared and conducted with the wants of the home and the demands of the family in view. The Commercial Department is conducted with great care, and everything possible is done to make the market reports reliable and complete. The Agricultural Department is carefully edited by a gentleman of ability and exper ience. The Home Department is of special interest to the ladies, and Is devoted to the practical and useful. To Educational Matters especial attention is given. Believing that the perpetuity of the republic depends upon the education of the people. The Inter-Ocean is the warm advo cate of the free school system, and everything that will improve and extend it. The Woman’s Kingdom is anew department devoted to the Interests of that large portion of the gentler sex who, either from necessity or otherwise, desire to devote themselves to some useful occupation or profession, for the purpose of earning a livelihood. It is not for the advocacy of any particular Issue, but for the general improvement and elevation of the ferar.le character In every depart ment of life. The Question and Answer Department, long a special feature of the Inter-Ocean, is a valu able encyclopedia of information, and covers as much ground in the course of a year as maty of the elaborate works published at such high prices. The Inter-Ocean has the largest aggregate circulation of any newspaper published in the Northwest, it lament, t.l. offices, distributed in every State and Territory in the United States, Inall the British provinces and numerous foreign states and countries.
