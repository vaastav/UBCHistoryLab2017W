DANIEL LOGAN EDITOR TUESDAY DECEMBER , 1910 For the "Paris of America," as San Francisco lias been called, its gift of bibles to the men of the visiting Japanese squadron is unique in strict est sense of the word. As a token of international friendship certainly nothing couhUbc more appropriate than the gospel of the Prince of Peace. Japan will certainly appreciate it too) coming from the city whose inept handling of the school question,, a few years ago, gave her affront. She is moreover too polite a nation, as well as conscious of considerable graft at home wlvich her newly established organ in New York lias admitted to suggest that, if the good people of San Francisco have not exhausted their .stock of bibles, copies might be presented to ' Ruef, Schmitz and company. A rule to keep dogs out of meat markets has been adopted by the San Francisco board of health, and the Chronicle urges that it should be extended to places where fruit and vegetables are sold. One of the oldest and rankest of nuisances -in Honolulu is that of dogs haunting the markets. In the campaign for clean and pure food which has been , fairly started the canine pest should not be neglected. Tr will unr take manv 28.000-ton battleships at $12,500,000 each to raise a tidal wave of financial trouble for Japan. Peace is bringing her wonderful prosperity, and it is strange that she should not let up on the war game. It cannot always be a winning one. i Hackcnschmidt could not throw Zlyszsko twice in an hour. It must " have been hard for the champion to keep from falling over the challen ger's naihe. , THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. ) So far as can be judged from the skeleton abstract cabled, President iTaft's message to Congress appears to be a statesmanlike deliverance. It is conservative in dealing with matters of national concern which bulked large in the recent congressional campaign, and it contains re commendations of legislation of both constructive and progressive na ture, some reform policies advanced being quite radical. That there should be no further legislation for the control, or regula- tion of corporations, while the existing laws in that regard are having their efficacy tested by vigorous proceedings in the courts, all sensible people will agree. Before putting more laws on the statute books it is well to ascertain just what laws or parts of laws now there are efficient for their respective purposes and wherein they may be defective, but cap able of amendment. .... With regard to the tariff there can be no two opinions of the wisdom ' of the President's decision to defer recommendations thereon until next Congress. Largely a new body, most of whose members- have been face to face with the people on this question, will most appropriately deal with all the tariff issues. His opposition to a general revision is equally well taken. Having announced his concurrence in the "progres sive" idea of revision schedule by schedule on a scientific basis, no oth er attitude of the President would be consistent. A truce to all tariff controversy for the remainder of the life df this Congress will not only be welcomed by all business interests, giving a fair cliance of thorough ly testing the merits of the late revision as well as avoiding a suspense prejudicial to business, but it will allow the present body needed scope to dispose of several vital matters that the country requires to have set tled. Among the most important subjects of legislation is that of restoring the American mercantile marine. It is gratifying to hear that President Taft urges the passage of a ship subsidy bill. Secretary Ballinger had already announced that he would have a measure of this kind ready for submission at this session. - Provision for two battleships is a fair naval program for the short session, and there is little doubt that Congress will grant it, as well as the nineteen million dollars asked for fortifying the Panama canal. The importance of the Pearl Harbor fortifications is recognized in the re commendation for their early completion, which also probably includes the naval station and drydock for which liberal estimates have been pre pared as previously cabled. Both improvement and reform in postal administration arc recom 1 mended, the extension of rural delivery, the establishment of a parcels post and the placing of all postmasters under the civil service being among the proposed measures. There will likely be a fight over the parcels post, as the great express .interests have successfully fought it . before and, at latest accounts, there was still a certain amount of pre judice against it on the part of country merchants to be removed. The public opinion in favor of this great convenience is, however, so strong that it must before long prevail. No doubt the proposal to take the postmasterships entirely out of politics will also be opposed by some of the old line politicians loth to lose the lever of patronage in their con stitutencies. But the people at large are probably with the President overwhelmingly in this proposed reform, so that if? consummation will not long be delayed. RaKE:&aEan3K3CSHaig
