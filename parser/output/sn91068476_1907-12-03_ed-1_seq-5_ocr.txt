The rlrcmeiT Thanksgiving 5port The Independent fire company suceeaaifuUy pulled otl two features oa Thursday the big turkey shoot ia tbe afternoon aud the skating carnival at night The turkey shoct began at 2-UI and lasted till tight dunug which time nine large bird were won and carried off by tbe hk eyed one. Serea of the turkeys were rontrat- edforby tbo who pieferred to try their luck, behind shotguns, while two of the Thanksgiving fowls we woa by those Luloo county sports that call themselves something w ith a rifle. In the contest with shotguns thte winning were: Herudon Hasty, tbe blonde haired, polite clerk of Uncle Sam's P. O., oue turkey. Two birds were taken back to their land of love by the renown ed old turkey and rabbit hunter. Josh Crook. The fourth feathered prize was taken to loved ones by Monroe's genial grocery mau, M. C Broom, while turkey No. 5 was vanished from the contest by U. W. Moser. who bit the bull's eye. Mr. W. II. Norwood, manager of Monroe s telephone system, who every oue thought could only talk, surprised the crowd and took home with bim No. 6 turkev. No. 7 bird was caught by Mr. W. A. Wolfe. Mr. J. E. Little, who has trained his eyes in handling horses to such perfection that be can spot a good one several blocks away, proceed ed to show some of the professionals with a ride "that they didn't know where the gun sight was," and took home to the Monroe Hotel turkey No. H for bis guests. It was ever thus. You can't win long over a newspaper man, and especially an editor. Mr. It F. Beasley, editor of Tbe Journal, who claims that be is terribly out of practice shooting other than air, was the recipient of turkey No. 9 by his unerring aim. Tbe fire company realized on this shoot about $17 net and are very thankful to its many frieuda. The firemen's skating carnival at night was an enjoyable affair, aud those present were turpi ised and bewildered as to who was who. Some forty skaters participated and all were gotten up in costumes that caused woudermeut A speci ally unique part of the masquerade was a sextette of men dressed as convicts. They, were attired in brand new convicts' suits obtained from ('apt. Fletcher, the good na tured manager of tbe Union comity chain gang, and to say the least they were certainly a lot that look ed like they were able to take any prize, regardless of the decision of judges. A great many of the skaters were so ably masqueraded that the judges, Mrs. Knfus Armfield, Mr. Kufus A rin held and Mrs. U. is. Caldwell, took some time in decid ing which lady was really dressed the best, and what man wore the mast undetected. Their decision was filially rendered in favor of Miss Iionuie Hasty as the lady who won the loving cup. she being dressed handsomely in a Western costume, a perfect representation of a Winchester rille advertising girl. Mr. Dcrwood Waller, dressed in full uuiform and equipped com pletely as oue of Uncle Sam's pri vates, was also given a loving cup for best man. Miss Lizzie Whitaker was given special mention by the Judges on account of ber representation ol the foreman or a tire company. The proceeds front the masquer ade amounted to f'."2.G0 for which the fireman also returned thanks. Where to go I from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until 11 o'clock at night:
