Tho National Thanksgiving was well observed yester day in ati portions of tho eountry from wbich we bave reports, and was no doubt generally recogulzod in every State of tho I'nion. In the metropolis and our suburban cilia* tho obfervanr# waa universal. The public offices, courts, banking houses, stores, business places of every kmd and hoIiooIs were closed, and people of nil clauses sad rouditlotis in life wero unanimous in making tho oc onaion a holiday. NcftwtthaUn ding the fact that the weather was very disagreeable, thiro being alternate falls of snow and rain throughout the greuter part of the day, the sen iles in the churches, the majority of which wore open, wero fairly attended. We give on another page sketches of the sermons und proceedings at sevoral of the plates of worship, as well as of the public thanksgiving festivals at some of the city institutions. The mow and rain, bow ver, destroyed many programme* for outdoor sport which bad been planned ; but tliey served to give additional nest to tho Indoor enjoyments ajid the happy f smily reunions at tho home fireside and around the homo board. The Catilornia A-sembly aud the Oregon Senate both ratified the anti-slavery amendment to the national con stitution on Wednesday lat-L From Washington we have the report, that at the Cabi net meeting held on Wednesday it was decided that Mr, Mallory, who during the exlstenco of tho Jeff. Davis con fsdemcywas >'on otary of that myth known as the rebel Nary Department, shall be arraigned for trial before a -civil tribunal within the next thirty days. The truth with regard to tho rebel bondholders in England is gradually leaking out. It w>ill be remembered that when the list was first sent across the water it was Indignantly returned, branded as a Nkw Yobk Hkhai.d Action, and that Mr. Delane, of tho Ixindon Timet, Mr. Gtadstone and nearly every other prominent man whose name was mentioned in the list, repudiated with much show of virtuous indignation ail connection with the aOhir. Our Paris correspondent now assures us that legal documents will shortly be published proving that the list was in the main correct. There were two ciassot of shareholders, It seemr? those who draw their interest in tho ordinary way, und those who were content to wait (be establishment of the Southern conlederacy before making any claim upon the fund. In this latter class were all the leading rebel symputh-sers in Kurope who so eagerly domed that they ever "rrceived" or "applied fer ' any rebel stock. The Hbbalo'b theory as to the prevarication on which these denials were based appears to have been the correct one. The cause of the recent raising of the siege of Mats nionM by the Mezicrtn republicans under General Ksc? bedo, heretofore frequently noticed in our columns, is explained l-y our Brownsville correspondent to have been solely a lack of ammunition.

The French inhabitants of Canada are adding to the disqatetiuie which the Ken lan excitement haa recently latHoted on the Canadian government.

The trial regarding tho estate of Bridget Davis, otherwise Adelia Ro*s, was then had, tho quostlon being as to the marriage of de ceased with one Peter Ross. The Surrogate decided the marriage not proven, and the property falls to tho wo man's diildren by a former ^mrriage. The Hopper aad Westervelt will cases were set down for nest Monday.

Rl|ni of ? WholcMome B*B?tion. After three days of business tbe two hoiiBoa of Congrena stand adjourned over to Monday next. This proceeding is customary, in order to allow the Speaker a fair chance for a careful sanction of tho standing committees of the House. We presume, however, that they will be essentially the name as they were last year, oh they have bocn already announced in the Senate. Meantime we are gratified to observe thnt within the short interval of three days there him been n remarkable abatement of tbe radical fovor which marked the first day's pro ceedings in both houses ? un abatement which we think may be attributed to the wholesome influence of the President's Message. On Monday, for example, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens bad it all his own way, and whipped through bin joint resolution for a joint commit tee on the condition of the rebellious States in nhort order. On the same day Messrs. Snmner, Wade and Wilson took possession of the Senate, and threw in work enough of a radical stamp for nix months' discussion. On Tuesday the Message was read to both houses ? a frank, manly, straightforward statesmanlike exposi tion of the condition of tbe country, and espe cially of the Southern States, and of his views and measures of reconstruction; and on Wednes day we perceive that it has not failed of a good impression on the House and in the Senate. Mr. Farnswortb, of Illinois, a radical of the Northwestern school, submitted to tbe House on Wednesday a resolution declaring it as the sense of that body that good faith demands that, ull colored soldiers who have been in the service of the Union shall enjoy all tbe rights ot citizenship. Of course "all the rights of citizenship" include the right of suffrage. But it appears that the House, on the spur of tbe occasion, was not prepared to adopt this reso lution, which, though limited to colored sol diers, involved a direct issue with President Johnson on the question whether this thing of tbe right of suffrage is a matter which belongs to Congress or to the several States. Upon this question, as the constitution and tbe usages of tbe past and the present time are all on the side of tbe President, a break with him, it was evidently thought, was an affeir entitled to a little cool considers ticta. And so, a debate arising on the resolution, Mr. Farnswortb was judiciously persuaded to let it go over to some other day, without attempting a two-thirds test for the suspension of tho rules. It appears that even the* terrible Thaddeus Stevens himself had become considerably softened since Mon day, and was altogether in a more amiable frame of mind on Wednesday. In tho Senate on the same dsr Mr Sumner unmasked another lfghj battery and opened ftre from it against the administration in a resolution referring to the oath of loyalty required of one class of men entering upon the duties of any public office, and remark ing thut "whereas it is reported that, n<Awith standing the acts of Congress, certain persons have been allowed to enter upon the duties of office (Treasury Department) and to receive the salary and emoluments thereof without taking the prescribed oath, and certain per sons have been appointed to office* not author used by any previously existing law, there fore resolved, that the Secretary of the Treas ury be requested, so for as the records of his department allow," See., to furnish the needful information on the subject This reso lution, over the shoulders of the Secretary of the Treasury, was evidently aimed at the President, and at his proceedings in reference to certain provisional offloials of his in the Southern States. Under the rule It lies over a day, and when called up again we may, per haps, have an interesting debate upon it. But the little passage at arms which followed between Mr. Sumner and Mr. Doolittle touched the kernel of the main question. Mr. Doolittle moved to refer that portion of the Message which treats of the existing relations ef the late rebel States to the Judiciary Committeo. Mr. Sumner remarked that thero was now on the Secretary's table a resolution (that of Mr. Stevens from the House) providing for the appointment of a joint committee to whom this subject should be referred. It would be better, he thought, to await the passage of this resolution and then let the subject (PreBident's Message in relation to the South) go to that speeial committee. Mr. Doolittle thought that the joint resolution itself ought to go to the Judiciary Committee, and just here the House proposition for an adjournment over to Monday came in and cut oif any ftirther proceedings. Here we see against Sumner a leading republi can Senator from the West boldly taking hi. 4 position on the side of the President "The result will probably be such a modification of the Stevens resolution as to leave each bouse, as the constitution ordains, the judge of the qualifications of its members, instead ef tying up and handing over both houses and the President to the care of a joint committee. In any event, the policy of Southern restora tion which President Johnson has adopted having been approved by all parties through out the country, he has no other course to pursue. Let him adhere to it, do all he can to secure from the States concerned the fulfilment of all his conditions, and, having fulfilled them, let him snbmit the rights of said Stated to n restoration to Congress. They may be rejected, but then the issue brought before the people in the elections for ihe next Congress will be a decisive victory for the administra tion. The President holds the impregnable ground that the excluded Southern Stales are not out of the Union, and never have been; that they only need a reorganization under the constitution and existing laws of the Union to be entitled to all the rights in the general government which belong to the other loyal States. He has only to adhere to this ground to secure the establishment of his policy in this Congress or the next. We believe, however, from tfye cooling down of the radicals on the day after the reception of the Message, that a whole some reaction has already commenced which will make the President's policy the programme of the present Congress. When such old radical campaigners as Thaddeus Stevens begin to tack ship it is because they seo breakers ahead. Mother O'Greelet and the Chirtkr Elec tion. ? Tbe philoBopber of the Tribune bas always felt proud of tbe rapport of tbe plain, honest country people. He puts in hifl columns such matter as be supposes may suit them, by tbe way of assisting: tbeir digestion of bis political nostrums. He tries to impose upon these honest people by an affectation of straightforward honesty and incorruptibility in himsolL Affecting the style of the ancient philosopher, Socrates, he wears old clothes, carries a smooth face, eats bran bread, and says in his general manner, " behold an honest man." He haB played tbis game pretty success fully; but be has evidently presumed too inr upon tbe credulity of bis country readers. The developments of tbe charter election in this city must undeceive these people. What will they think of liis alliance with Fernando Wood to defeat tbe regular candidate of his party? Such n incongruous political connec tion is remarkable ? is tfyit of Beauty and the Beast, nnd cun only be explained as having a bearing upon the piers and wharves job, or some other similar job. Greeley and tbe Woods united! What a union! All the humbug nig ger philanthropy of the Tribune cannot destroy the effect of such corrupt political miscegena tion. The country people can no longer believe in the political honesty of tbe Tribune philoso pher. Poor Greeley ! we suspect he will soou discover a rapid tailing off in his subscription list. Report or the Secretary of the Inte rior. ? We give to-day an abstract of tbe report of the Secretary of tbe Interior, which gives a gratifying exposition of the internal affairs of tbe country. It appears that upwards of five and a quarter millions of acres of land were disposed of during the last year and one quarter of the previous year. The aggregate quantity of surveyed public lands undisposed of Sep tember 30, 1865, was one hundred and thirty two million two hundred and eighty-five thou sand an<l thirty-five acres. The Indian depre dations and the policy of their extermination are commented upon, the Secretary taking ground aguinst the latter as inhuman and nn christian. We are gratified to learn that the publication of tbe census of 1860 is neatly completed. The progress of the Union Pacific Railroad is referred to in the most encouraging terms, while the Northern Pacific road ? from Lake Superior to Puget Sound ? Is mentioned as having suspended operations, if they were ever commenced, after the passage of tbe act donating enormous grants of land in aid of the project. The Radicaui as Pro-Slavery Men.? The radicals in Congress are practically the Inst upholders and friends of the institution of slavery. They deny the political existence of the States whose votes would secure the rati fication of the constitutional amendment, and so permit their party rancor to stand In tbe way of tbe final abolition of the institution that they have pretended to hate, and whose destruction they bfve held up as the prims object of all tbeir oolitical efforts.

VMMM. Oar Washington correspondent has tele graphed a? that the portion of the President's Message referring to our relations \yith England was received in Congress with emphatic and unanimous applause. That portion of the Message simply recites the hostile act's com mitted against us by Great Britain daring the recent war, and concludes with the significant remark that, "for the future, friendship be tween the two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice," From this remark we in fer?and England may as well aecept the same construction ? that there is to be ne friendship between the two countries for the future until full justice is done us for the injuries inflicted daring the recent rebellion. If we do not phoose to go to far at present, that is no reason why we should either forget or for give the many wrongs which we have suffered, and which the President clearly and succinctly recites. The formal accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States ; the supplies of materials of war sent to the rebels from British manufactories ; the ravages of British pirates sailing under the flag of a nation that did net exist ? these outrages upon the United States demand compensation and apology at the hands of the British government ; and, since even arbitration has been refused, they fully jus tify us in declaring war against Great Britain, although we shall consult our own convenience as to the time when war is to be declared. Under these circumstances the Presidents stern and menacing tone towards England is exceed ingly appropriate, and it is unanimously en dorsed, approved and re-echoed by the country. A quotation from the New York corres pondence of the London Spectator, published in these columns on Wednesday, shows that our interpretation of the President's remark in regurd to our relations with England is quite correct. IMiis correspondence gives the do tails of a conversation with Secretary Sewnrd, in whicli Mr. Seward said that ho hud told Sir Frederick Bruce, the British Minister, that " tho way towards anything more than the present relations of mere formal amity between tho two peoples and governments must be led by the British people and tho British government. If the Biitibh were content with our present attitude towards each other, we wore; but if any change wore made in it for the better it must be of British making." Mr. Seward added that " we were the aggrieved party, ' and that "4t was not for us to seek a reconciliation." He concluded this verbal despatch to Sir Frederick Bruce by slating that "nothing could be expected from us but to stand upon punctilio, as well as upon our essential rights, and insist upon both in the minutest particular," and thai "this was as fur as the. people of this country would allow any administration to go in that direction" ? mean ing in the direction of conciliation. 'Mr. Seward is quite right in this statement. Indeed, he might have explained that it is with the great est diOlculty that the American people are induced to be satisfied with even a "formal amity" towards a government which has in sulted us so gro&sly, injured us so wantonly, and refused reparation so impudently and un justly. Beyond all question, a war with Eng land would be most popular, and bad not President Johnson wisely resolved to settle up all our internal difficulties before dealing with our foreign relations, and had not the people Acquiesced in his decision bocatu>e of thoir confidence in his patriotism and ability, tho recent Message would certainly have con tained a declaration of war. But we know that we shall lose nothing by waiting. Neither the debt that England owes us nor our power to collect it will be lessened by time. And Canada will not move out of our reach in the meanwhile. The tone of that portion of the Prea ident's Mewage which refers to France is in marked coutrost with its tone towards England. Presi dent Johnson does not forget, and the Ameri can people cannot forget, that, while England has always been our bitterest enemy, France is our old and trusty friend. If to England the President speaks sternly, to France he ad dresses rather a remonstrance than a throat Nevertheless, it is impossible for him to overlook the fact that the attempt to establish a foreign monarchy upon the tomb of the Mexican republic is an act of indirect hostility towards the United States, and lie therefore reasserts the Monroe Doctrino in terns which are perfectly plain without being in the least degree menacing. He evi dently hopes and expects that France will withdraw from Mexico quietly and without a war, and he says nothing which can in any way render more difficult the delicate problem of retiring gracefully from an untenable position which the Emperor Napoleon is called upon to solve. The President is clearly determined to place upon Frunce the onus of the quarrel if a war shall become necessary to vindicate the Monroe Doctrine, lie speaks of a European Power "challenging the American people to the defence of republicanism against foreign interference," and, although he cannot say that we will refuse such a challenge, he does say that we would regard it as a great calamity, and be hopes that .it will never be offered. "We rely," he adds, "upon the wisdom and justice of European Powers to respect the system of non-inter ference which has so long been sanctioned by time, and which, by its good results, has approved Itself to both continents." The Emperor Napoleon cannot fail to ad I mire arid to respect the powerful modera tion of these sentiments and the calm and kindly manner in which they are expressed. We do not doubt that the hopes of President Johnson will be realized, and that France will relinquish a scheme which is not popular among her own people, and which offends her oldest and truest friends. Let her do this, and the friendship between the two countries will be almost frateAal, and the bonds of union formed by the traditions of the past will be strengthened by the mutual justice and genia lity of our ftiture relations. Towards Eng land, however, we can entertain only a "formal amity" until the Alabama debt is paid and guarantees given fqjr the ftiture. Th* Fenian Bonds.? Where are the bonds of the Irish republic, those miraculous specimens of artistic conception and exquisite exeoution? The tint week of the past month was positively set down for their issue, lmt up to this time there has not been the least sign of them. Perhaps, though, the leaders of the movement, with speculation In thehr souls, have bought them all ut>. desirous of reaoina the rlph bjtfvest accruing from their >pe?*7 redemption. Or it may be that a sufficient alk'01^ of the ".need ful" ii in the Fenian coffer* to the neces sity for their issue at aiL If tbil* latter be the case we heartily congratulate the B. on the plethoric state of their treasury; Vut If the former, the public has been done an injustice which to deservable of the most condign punishment. Let us burst in ignor.tnce no longer. Pray tell ns what has become of the bonds! The History ? t the W?r-Gnntial Onat'l Report. General Grant writes as be fights. The dif ference between his report and the other re~ ports that have recently been laid before the public to as broad and dear as between his battles and die battles of any of the gen erals who preceded him in the command of our armies, lie is equally uncompromising in the field and on paper. He goes straight to the point He states the particulars of a battle in half a dozen sentences that leave ns nothing to desire. He tells the truth fearlessly and openly. He praises with most generous free dom all whose . actions be can -approve; but if any unlucky delinquent comes in the way of his curt, brusk narrative, so much the worse for that delinquent He has, in short, in his report added to military literature a document that to impressed through and through with the qualities of his own mind ? that to, bold, free, simple, incisive, and direct in the ex treme ? a document that to as superior to all other mere formal official reports as his achieve ments were to everything else in our military history. Grant's report Bhows how magnificently the drama of war will go ahead when all its parts are under the direction of a master mind, and when the puvposo is to carry on war in real earnest ai)d annihilate the armed force ot the enemy. It quite involuntarily puts in the broadost and clearest light tha distinction between the conduct of the war in the year when Grant was Lieutenant General and di rected all our operations, and the way in which it was conducted in the years before he rose to that high position. The country re members very well how we blundered on through all those early years; how our opera tions langu'shed until it often seemed that the result would be against us by default; bow often our generals marched up hill only to march down again. But in this report it to called to mind again how different the style was in Grant's year; with what directness and purpose everything went forward; how promptly blow followed blow, and how grand was the progress of events from his starting point at Chattanooga to the final scenes when the history of the war became "the record of the successive surrenders" of rebel generals. "From the first," says the hero, "1 was firm In the conviction that no peace could be had that would be stable and condu cive to the happiness of the people, both North and South, until the military power of the re bellion was entirely broken.1' That was the key note. It was waste of time to parley, utterly useless to stand with folded hands and wait to see it' may be some one could not patch up the quarrel. There was nothing to do but to fight ? fight ? fight! to "hammer continu ously," to pound away until the enemy should be so exhales tod by the power we could array against him that he 6hould not have the strength to raise a hand against the govern ment. With what wonderful persistency and effect Grant carried on the war in this way his report tells, and no other historian will ever | equal the foroe, lucidity and point with which he tells H. Some of the best parts of the report are its references to other generals, and we see their exact value given at onoe to the good and the bad, as if they were weighed in the very scales of juatice. Grant's references to Butler put that doughty personage before the country in the proper light for the first time. They show how a prac eal, sincere man regards such an empty, blatant pretonder, and justly hold him up to contempt Butler was instructed from the first in the cam paign against Richmond that that city was his objective point, and that he was to co-operate with tbe Army of the Potomac, and to seize or invest the rebel capital while Meade engaged Lee on the Rapidan. The plan was perfect, and no person with leas ingenuity than Butler would have found it possible to spoil it. But ler, however, managed wonderfully not to do what was requisite. He as shown that Rich mond could not be reinforced from the south or from Lee's army, and was at his mercy; but instead of seizing it he sat down at Bormuda Hundwd and wrote despatches and "suffered tbe enemy to as completely shut him off from further operations against Richmond as if be had been in a bottle strongly corkdil." Such is Grant's contemptuous disposal of Butler's co-operation against the rebel capi tal. Subsequently, when Grant was crossing the James, the enemy left the road from Rich mond to Petersburg on Butler's front unde fended, and Butler seized it. Grant, seeing the advantage, sent the Sixth corps to enable But ler to hold what he bad taken, and Butler kept tbe Sixth corps in idleness, while the enemy recaptured the road. Nothing but Butler's Fort Fisher failure could bave put a climax to these achievements. Grant shows how the order for Weitsel to act against Wilmington was smothered by Butler; how Butler went where he was not sent and came away when there was no reason; and then how Terry, with nnarly the same force, accomplished what But ler had declared impossible. M the sequel to this Grant merely says: ? ?' At my request Mnjor General B. F. Butler was relieved, and Major General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the command of tbe Department of Virginia and North Caro lina." Butler in this report and Butler before the Committee on tbe Conduct of tbe W ar ? or making speeches at Lowell? are very difformt persons. ? As a contrast to Grant's picture of Butler wo may put his picture of Sheridan. This sol dier was always doing exactly what was want ed, at exactly the right time and in the neatest possible way. When he commanded in the Shenandoah valley and Early lsy in his front, Grant, seeing the danger to us of a defeat there, feared to order battle without an exact knowledge of the position. He started, there fore, to see it with his own eyes. He met Sheridan, however, at Charleston; and he pointed out so distinctly how eseh army lay; what be oould do the moment hefras autho rised, and expressed snob confidence of success, that there were bat two words of instruction necessary? "Go in!" Tbe victory *t Op?quan was the result. Butlor h*4 to bv bodged i on ad and bolstered up with page oa page of minute instruction, and even then could always find a reason why be should not do the thing ha ^ ought For Sheridan two words were enough, and the victory came. Grant tells plainly that he did not like Thomas' delay to strike Hood as soon as the latter reached Nashville; yet ha adds,xwith a grand sense of justice, "His defeat of liood was so complete that it will ha accepted as a vindication of that distinguished officer's judgment" But he intimates an opinion that Hood's back was weakened bo fore he got to Nashville. Speaking of the battle at Franklin he says: ? "Ybla was the first serious opposition the enemy met with, and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations." Of Hood's movement past Sherman's right to Nashville ? that grand piece of strategy concocted by Davis? we have the tiftmple declaration, "Had I had the power to command both armies, I should not have changed the orders under which Hood seemed to be acting." As Frederick the Great forgave his enemies the lies they told on account of the blunder they committed, so Grant could ehstly tolerate all Davis' speeches for the sake of that magn?Acent piecs of acted stupidity. Grant declares that the history of Sherman^ flank movements from Chattanooga to Atlanta "will ever W read with fur interest unsurpassed by anything in history." The particulars of i the growth of that great oampaiga in the twe minds are marked down with the modesty of * nature too noble to claim the tithe of wbat bo longs to another. 9air tribute is pud to- Meade also, whose "commanding always in the presence of an officer superior to him in rank ha?dratra from him much of that public attention' that his seal and ability entitle him to, and which he would otherwiso have rsoei^d." But undoubtedly the ?bost of all Grant's declara tions is tbut in relation to the qualities of the soldiors ? "It has been . my fortune to boo the arnilos of both the West and the East fight bat tles, and from what I have soen I know there is no difference in their fighting qualities. All that, it was possible for men- to do in battle they have done. The Western armies commenced their battles in the Mississippi valley and re ceived the final surrender of the remnant of the principal army opposed to them in North Caro lina. The armies of the East commenced their battles on the river from whioh the Army of the Potomac derived its name and received the final surrender of their old antagonist at Appo mattox Court House, Virginia. The splendid achievements of each have nationalized oar victories." This splendid recognition of the qualities ?f our soldiers closes a document that baa ne equal either for the' grand events of which it treats or tor the admirable, generous, just and manly spirit in whioh it tells its story. Tlie Rem from Kurop? ? EtiKlUhTnable* ?t Home and Abroad. ( Earl Russell's reconstructed Cabinet appear by the latest European advices to be having anything bat an easy time of it. The Fen Una at home and complications abroad are leading them a somewhat uncomfortable life. Notwith standing the fact that Fonianism in Ireland has been repeatedly reported as completely crushed, this hydra-headed Brotherhood per sists in cropping up in all dlreotiona, and ths latest precautions taken by the British govern mcnt in the garrisoning of Pigeon House Fort, Dublin, show that serious trouble is stUl anti cipated. Pigeon House Fert commands the city and bay of Dublin, and it has historical associations which will give the action of the government great significance in the eyes of the Irish s' nation. In 1846 the guns were double shotted, and the garrison kept under arms all night, just as in the present instance. Then, as now, it was against the Irish people themselves that these precautions were directed. Daniel O'Connell and his repealers were the dreaded foe in 1848; President O'Mahony and hfti Fenians in 1866. The mere appearance of thren large steamers in the offing of Dublin Bay suf ficed to couvince the commander of Fort Pigeon House that the long expected Fenian priva teers had arrived at last. So, in hot baste hn posted off to the Lord Lieutenant and declared that unless reinforcements were sent to him hn would not be answerable for the safety of tba city. Accordingly the garrison was increased, the guns loaded, and every preparation mado for an immediate engagement with the enemy. How far this new scare of the Dublin govern ment is justified by facts the Fenian Congress in secret session could probably toll us. Bat it is at least clear that the ghost of the Ala bama is haunting the British government, and their trepidation will probably not be dimin ished when they receive President Johnson's Message. To add still fhrther to their anxiety comes the escape of Stephens, the mysterious Head Centre, from the dungeon in which the au thorities fondly hoped they had securely bound him. It is scarcoly possible that the prisoner could have effected his release without the con nivance of bis jailers, and it Fenianism has spread into the ranks of the very minions of the law no further fact is required to show that the ramtfications of the Brotherhood in Ireland are both extensive and mysterious. ^ The action of the Spanish government in Chile is another source of embarrassment to the government * In the abstract, John Ball cares little who id right and who is wrong in this dispute. It is from no romantlo Intention of protecting the weak against the strong that the merchants of Liverpool arc clamoring for English intervention against Spain. Bnt their pockets have been touched severely by tho blockade of the Chilean ports, and conse quently their indignation is loud against Spanish aggression. Earl Kussell has promptly replied to their entreaties by desjtatching on* of bis characteristic menacing despatches to the Spanish government, and apparently has plncod himself in snch a position that either be must submit to a snub from the Spanish gov ernment or enter upon an inconvenient and inglorious war. Under ordinary circum stances, perhaps, Lord Russell jprould take tbo snubbing and sneak out of the discussion, as be dill With Russia over the Polish insurrec tion and from Prussia in the Danish war. But be bas the reputation of his government to make; he aspires to wear Lord Palmerston'n mantle, and must, therefore, show a bold front. He will be the better able to do this as his adversary is very small and a powerful ally in the person of the Bmperor Napoleon it ready to assist him. Thf. Nioosn in Cowoasw. ?
