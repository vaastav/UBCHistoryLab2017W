It Is n matter .of regret that no con Biderablo advauco has been made to- wards an adjustment of tho differences botweon tho United States and Great Britain, arising out of tho depredations upon our national commerce and other . trwnruwes committed during our civil ,.war by British tubjects, In violation of International law and treaty obllgtv tlons. The delay, ) owever, may bo be lieved to havo resulted In no Binall de gree from tho domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire cliango of ministry occurred in that country dur ing tho last session of Parliament. The attention of tho new ministry was call ed to tho subject at an early day, and there Is boiiio reason to expect that it will now bo coiibldeicd In a becoming and friendly spirit. Tho Importance of nn early disposition of tho nucstion can not bo exaggerated. Whatever might be tho disposition of tho two governments it is manifest that good-will and friend 'eltlp between tho two countries cannot bo established until a reciprocity, In tho practice of good-faith and neutrality. Khali bo restored between tho respective nations. Tlin FENIAN INVASION". On tho sixth of Juno last, in violation of our neutrality laws, a military expo' dltlonmidontorprlsoagainst tho British North American Colonies was projected and attempted to bo carried on within tho territory nnd jurisdiction of the United States. In obedience to the ob . ligation imposed upon tho Exccutivo by tho Constitution, to sco that tho laws aro faithfully executed, all citizens were warned, by proclamation, against taking part in or aiding such unlawful proceed ings, and tho proper civil, military, and naval officers were directed to take all necessary measures for the enforcement of tho laws. Tho expedition failed, but it has not been without its painful con sequences. Somo of our citizens who, It was alleged, wero engaged in tho ex pedition, have been captured, and havo been brought to trial, as for a capital offence, In tho Provlnco of Camilla. Judgment nnd sentonco of death havo been pronounced against soino, while others havo beon ncquitted. Fully be lloving.tho maxim of government, that sovorlty of civil punishment for mis guided persons who havo engaged in revolutionary attempts which havo dis astrously failed is unsound and unwise, such representations have been mado to tho British Government, In behalf of tho convicted porsons, as, being sustain ed by an enlightened and humane judg ment, will, It is hoped, induce in their case3 on oxcrc'iso of clemency, and a ju dicious amnesty to all who wero engaged in tho movement. Counsel lias been employed by tho Government to defend citizens of tho United Statos on trial for capital offences in Canada; and a dis continuance of tho prosecutions which wero instituted, in tho Courts of tho United States against thoso who took part in tho expedition has been directed. I havo regarded tho oxpedltiou as not only political In its niture, but as also In a great measure foreign from tho -United States In its causes, character, and objects. Tho attempt was under stood to bo mado in sympathy with an insurgent party in Ireland, and, by striking, at a British Province on this continent, was designed to aid In obtain ing redress for political grievances which, it was assumed, tho people of Ireland had suffered at the hands of tho British Government during a period of soveral centuries. Tho persons engaged In it wero chlolly natives of that coun try, somo of whom had, while others had not, becomo citizens of tho United States under our general laws of natur a-'ization. Complaints of lnlsgovern ment iu Ireland continually engago the attention of tho British nation, and so great an agitation Is now prevailing In Irelund that thu British Government have deemed It necessary to suspend tho writ of Imbeaa corpus In that country. Theso circumstances must nccmuirlly modify tho opinion which wo might otherwise havo entertained In regard to an expedition expressly prohibited by our neutrality laws. So long as these laws remain upon our statute-books, they should bo faithfully executed, and if they oporato harshly, unjustly, or op pressively, Congress alouo can apply tho remedy, by their modification or repeal. rA KIU'Iiri3ENTATI0N WANTED FOH n (1UEECE. Political and commercial Interest's of tho United States are not unlikely to bo affected In Somo degreo by ovents that aro transpiring In tho eastern regions of Europe, and tho tlmo seoms to havo coino when our Government ought to have a proper diplomatic representation intGrocco. TO LI Til' A I. EX V L A N AT I ON'. 'This Govermnent has claimed for all porsons not convicted, or nccip-od, or suspected of crime, an absoluto political right of self-expatriation, and a choleo ofi'now national aljegianco. ,3Iotof tlio European State havo dlHsenJcd from this principle', and havo ciulmrxUa'ijglir ir " "' , ... .. m !- " ' . ...-, i. to hold Mich of their subjecta n'l havo Immigrated to and been naturalized In tho United Slates, and Afterward re turned on transient visits to their native countries, to tho performance of mili tary service In like manner as resident subjects. C'omplrtlnU arising from the claim In this respect made by foreign Slates, have heretofore been matters of controversy between tho United Stales and somo of tho Kuropcan Powers, and tho Irritation consequent upon tho fail ure to sottlo tills question Increased during tho war in which Prusda, Italy, and Austria wero resontly engaged. Whllo Great Britain has never acknowl edged tliorlHtt of expatriation, sho has" not practluidy lusUto 1 upon It. France has been equally forbearing, and Prus sia has proposed a compromise, which, although evincing Increased liberality, has not boju n-jajpto I by tho Uaitod States. Peace is now prevailing every where iu Kurope, and tho present scorns to be a favorable tlmo for an assertion by Congress of tho principle, so long maintained- by the Executive Depart ment, that naturallzalton by one State fully exempts the native -bom subject of any other State from tho performance of military service under any foreign government, bo long as he does not voluntarily renounce Its rights and bench ts. 

CONCLUSION. In tho performance of a duly imposed upon mo by the Constitution, 1 huvo thus submitted to tho Bepresentatlve-i of theStatesaudof the people such Infor mation of our domestic and foreign af fairs as the public Interests seem to re quire. Our Government is now under going its moat trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer Is that tho peril may bo successfully and finally passed, without Impairing Its original strength and sym metry. Tho Interests of tho nation are best to bo promoted by tho revival of fraternal relations, tho complete ob literation of our past differences, and the relnnuguratlon of nil tho pursuits of peace. Directing our efforts to thoearly accomplishment of these great ends, let us endeavor to preserve harmony be tween tho co-ordinate Departments of tho Government, that each in lis proper sphcro may cordially eo-operato with tho other in securing tho malntonanco of tho Constitution, tho preservation of tho Union, and the perpetuity of our freo institutions.

Ve present to our readers the Message of tho President of tho United States, sent to tho opening session of Congress. It is perhaps the best Slato paper ho has yet promulgated, and wo are glad to observe that the President does not in tho least abate from his well understood position iu favor of tho admission of loyal Senators nnd'Hcprcsonlatlvcs from tlio Southern States at once. Jle pro ceeds to argue, that in all the recent leg islation of Congress, the status of that portion of tho Union lately in rebellion has been recognized as Stales, and that now It Is too late to assume and treat them as Tenitories. In tho matter of levying and collecting taxes, in the Ju dicial proceedings of the national courts, in tho Executive department by Procla mation of Peace, and In other modes and manners, repeated olllcial acts havo trea ted tho Southern States as States; and the President repeats his earnest hope that the Southern States will very soon bo admitted to seats in tho legislative branch of tho Government, and to all their rights under tho Constitution nil equal , so vereign,and independent States, Tho Message contains, and gives a succinct statement of tho finances of tho United States, shows tho very agreeable fact of n reduction, during tho year end iug thirty-flr.it October, 1800, of $a)U. 3T.)filV; tho debt being now stated at S2.,!j1,:U0.000, or in round numbers at two billions and a hair. It is thought that tho rate of reduction will continue at an advanced ratio. Tho condensation of tho reporls of tho War,Xavy,anl Po-t-Olllce Departments Is equally satisfactory, and gives a suf ficiently full exposition of tho respect ive departments. And wo refer to tho Mossngo Itself for more full information. Tho President recommends a law pro viding for tho election of a delegate to Congress from tho District of Columbia, in order that tho people of the District may bo heard when laws are proposed referring to their interests. Tho reference to our foreign affairs shows that so far as tho President is con cerned, tho honor of tho United States and our prestlgo among the nations bhall bo maintained. Tho affairs of Mexico aro fully discussed, reference Is made to our British complications and tho Fen Ian question, and a fidl statement of thu present position of all concerned. No reference whatever Is mado by tho President to tho pending Constitutional Amendment, nor to tho question of suf frage In tho Slates. It was doubtlc wise in the President not to discuss tho question in his Annual Mossago, and to avoid as much as possible, consistent with hla duties, tho introduction of top ics of dispute nnd disagreement. Wo havo no Idea that Congress will admit tho South to representation, or inauuoy win permit uo restoration oi tho Union for which so much bloodomd treasure wore given. ,Ou that question tho President and Congress stand jW where they did last session. Tho Dem ocratic parly occupied an Independent position, ready at all times to iwsist In tho restoration of tho Union upon tho principle of tho equality and integrity of tho States, nnd tho doctrine of tho superiority of tho whllo raco.
