Tne President’s Annual Message. Full Text cf ihe Document, A* Delivered to Congress on Honda;, December li. Fi "-.w-Citlzens of the Senate atiff II use of R.-p --reseiitittives: I congratulate you on the continued and in creasing prosperity of our country. By the 1 vi.rot Divim Providence we have bi.en bh-ssed. luring the past year, with health, with abund ant harvests, with profitable employment for all our p ople, and with contentment at home, and with peace and friendship with other nations. The 's-currence of the twenty-fourth election of < 'hi. f Magistrate has ffor.led another op portunity to the people of the Un ted S'atos to <-xti-! it to the world a significant e\ mr-e of the pi ae* fn! and sub transmission of t .- po.vi t and nffhority of Government from tie public si-rvants whose terms of office a;*' about to t-xpire. to thi ir n.-vvlv-chos.-n suecess < rs. 'lhis example cannot fail to impress pro foundly thonghttul people of other countries with the advantages which republican institu tion-- afford. Tilt; immediate, general and ch.-i-rful acquiescence of ail good citizens in the r* suit of the election gives gratifying assurance to our country and to its friends throughout t a world that a Government based on the fn-e con- nt <>f an intelligent and patriotic people p-i.-se-st-s elements of stn-ngth, stability and I • rmaiu-ney u.*t lotind in any other form of (iov.-rument, • oiitinufil opposition to the full and free en joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred upon the colored people by the recent amend ments to the constitution, still prevails in sev • ral ol the late slave-holding States, It lias, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent t lection to any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudu lent practices in connection with the ballots, with the regulations, as to the place and manner of voting, and with counting, returning, and canvassing the votes cast, been successful in (li - fe.*, ting the exercise of the right preservative of ail rights, the right of suffrage, which the v -illinium expressly confers upon our enfran chised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the "hole country that sectionalism as a factor in our polities should disappear. They prefer that no see iou of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obe • •> the <qual-righta a::..mum. ut ■ • constitution is all that now stand-in the wav of a complete obliteration of sectional hues in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly vio lated or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed them in the constitution, as embodying the le gitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act to gether, and to insist that they shall be obeyed the paramount question still is as to tin-"en joyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite qualification to freely east his vot -and to have it honestly counted. With this question rightly settled, the country will t>e relieved of the contentions of the past ; by gones will indeed he bygones, and political and iiiirty issues with respect to economy and effi ciency of administration, internal improve ments. the tar.ff, domestic taxation, educa tion. finance and other important subjects "id then receive their full share of atten te >u ; hut resistance to and nullification of the results of the war will unite together in res olute purpose for their support all who main tain the authority of the Government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. I'his detent limit ion proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments n sts upon the fundamental principles of our Government. They are the solemn expression of the will of the people of the United states. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our cdizeiis must be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the Government of the country. Happily, the his tory of tire lute election iihows tUnt in many parts of the country where opposition to the Fifteenth amendment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing, and is likely to cease al together, if firm and well-considered ac tion is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of the elections, re turns and qualifications of tin ir own members, wi 1 s> i* to it that every case of violation of the U tter or spirit of the Fifteenth amendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit fitm snob violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparin ly all who have been en gaged in depriving citizens of the rights guar anteed them by the constitution. It is not. however, to he forgotten that the best and surest, guarantees of the primary rights of cinzens!.u> is to be found in that ca pacity for self-proTi ction which can 1 1 long only to a people whose right to universal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means at th* command ot the! >eal and State amhori t e- are. in many cases, wholly inadequate to furnish fn-e instruction to all who need it. T is is especially true where, hi fore emancipa tion. the education of the people was neglect ( i or prevented, in the interest of slavt ry. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole Country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of the United States. I t -pectftllly recninun nd that Congress, by suitabU- legislation and with proper safe-guards. -■ -o ■-rant the local edu cational funds in the several States where tlie grave duties and n sponsihihtU s of citizenship nave been devolved on uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and, if nee* s-ary. by appropriations from the treasury of the United States. What ever Government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought t ) be done. Wherever g- n< ral education is found, peace, virtue and social ord-r prevail, and civil and religi >us liberty are secure. In my former annual messages. I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent neces sity of a reformation of the civil strvi -e sys tem of the Government. My vi* ws concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments for persona! or partisan considerations, have been strengthen*.! by my observation and experi en t- in the E\* cutive ■ lli e, and I believe these dangers thr* at* n the stability of the Govern ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can not be p nnanenfly tolerated. They tend to t * come more alarming with the enlargement of administrative m rvtee, as the growth of the country in imputation increases the number of officers and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint ments. promotions and removals, establishing a uniform method, having exclusively in view, in i vi ry instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most eco nomical and efficient administration of the pub lic business. Comp* titive examinations, in aid of impartial appointments and promotions, have been con ducted for some years past in several of the Executive Departments, and by ray direction this system has 1-en adopted in the Custom Houses and Postoftj.-ee of the larger cities of Hte country. In the city of New York over two thousand positions in (he civil service have been subject, in their appointments and tenure of place, to the operation of puh lished rules for this pnq'ose, during the part two years. The results of these practical trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the same t* rts. and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It se cures for the position applied for the Bat qualifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure of importunity, which, under any other course pursued, largely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to their great detriment in the discharge of other official duties, pr* vent ing the abuse of the s* rviee for tin. mere fur th ranee of private nr party purposes, and !• liv ing the employe of the Government, fo ed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to de pend solely upon merit for retention and ad vancement. and with this con.-tant incentive to exertion and improvement. These invaluable results have been attained ■ : n a high degree in the offices where the rules for appointment by competitive examination have been applied. A method winch has so approved itself bv experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive should lie tits-adui to all cubord-.au. positions under the Government. I believe that a strong and grow ing f nl lie sentiment demands immediate meas ures lor securing and enforcing the hipliest po- ible efficiency in the civil service, and its protection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in the Custom Houses and Pcstoffices have been held under many embar rassments, and without prov sion for conijien satiou for the extra labor performed by the of ficers who have conducted them, and whose commendable interest in the improvement of the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor whifhout pecun.ary reward. A continuance of these labors pratuTously ought not to I*) expected, and without an appropria tion by Congress for compensation it is not practicable to extend the system of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It is also important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 1.753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes the Presi de.? to presciibe the regulations for admission to the civil service of the United States, and for tliis purpose to employ suitable persons to con duct the requisite inquiries with reference to “the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age. h' iltii, character, knowledge, and ability, for the branch of service into which he seeks to ( nt< r but the law is practically inoper ative for the want of the requisite appropria tion. I therefore recommend an appropriation of •rtlo.hOo per annum to meet the exjH'nses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in aooc' r lance with the terms of tins section, "lase duty it shall bo to devise a just, uniform and efficient sy-tem of competitive examina tions, and to stqtervise the application of the sain- throughout the entire civil service of the Government. lam pursuaded lint the facili ties which sin h a commission will afford for testing the fitness of those "ho apply for oflici will not only he as welcome a r< tief to members of Congress as it "ill 1 e to the President and heads of depart ments, but that itwill also greatly tend to re move the causes of embarrassment which now into it ably an i constantly atP ml the conflicting claims of patronage between the Legislative and Executive departments. The most effect ual check upon the pernicious com pi tit ion of influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office will he the substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicants, in which every one can make his own record, with the a > urance that his success will depend upon this alone. I also recommend such legislation ns, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to expiess his political oj diions an 1 to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel ns safe as anv private citizen in refusing ail demands upon las :iy o political pnrp. s< -. A law "Inch should ti n. guarantee true liberty and justice to id! wh.• are engaged in the public service, and likewise contain string! nt provisions again.d the m-e ul official authority to coerce the pohf cal acti . 1 private citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desin 1. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and csjkdal ly to a reform in th*- im tbod of appointment and removal, has been found to be the prac tice, under v hat is known as the spoils system, by which the appointing power Ims been so largely encroached upon by members of Con gress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments. The cor rupting doctrine that “to the victors belong the spoils” is inseparable from Congres sional patronage as the established rule and practice of parties .u power. It conics to he understood by applicants for office, and by the people generally, that Representatives and Senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their n spoctive districts and States. It is not necessary to recite at length ti e evils resulting from this invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of gov rnment on the subject of appointmci ts to office, as stated in the National Conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by tic American peo ple, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all-important subject are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the Govern ment. “Under the constitution the President and beaus of departments are to make nominations tor office. The Senate i.-: to advise and consent to appointments, and the House of Represen tatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless offi cers. The h<*st interest of the public service df mands that these distinctions be respected ; that Senators and Representatives, who may lie judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to of lb e.” To this end the co-operation of the Legislative Department of the Government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members of Congress will n >t be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until, by legislative enactment, the per nicious practice is condemned and forbidden It is therefore recommended that an act lo pa-sed defining the relations of members of Congress with reference to appointments to of fice by the President, and 1 also recommend that the provisions of si .-ectioiis following, of the Rented Statutes, comprising the Tenure-of-Office act. of March 2. J Hi>7. be i t pealed. Relieving that to reform the system and metlc ds of the civil service in our couutro is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can he per manently done only by the co-operation of the Legislative and Executive Departments of the Guv* rnment, I again commend the whole sub ject to your considerate attention. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress polygamy "lu re it now exists in our Terri tories, and to prevent its extension. Faith ful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to en force the laws against it. Experience has mown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, r< quires extensive modifica tion and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will he to ac complish what is desired. Prompt and de cid< 1 measures are necessary. The Mormon seetarian organization which upholds polygamy h;s the whole power of making and t v outing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries, it po--esses large influence over the administra tion of ju-tice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territoiy. they are able to make effec tive their hostility to the law of Con gress on the subject of polygamy, and, m fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law d< pen h- on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking awav the political power of the sect which en courages and sustains it. The power of Con gress to enact suitable laws to protect the Ter ritories is ample. It is not a case of half-way measures. The political power of the Mormon s- ct is increasing ; it controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous Territories. It is extending steadily into other Terri tories. Wherever it goes it establishes po lygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner-stone of our American society and i .vili/ation. Religious liberty and the separa tion of church and state are among the ele mentary ideas of free institutions. To rc-es tabli-h th interests and principles which po lygamy an I Mormonism have imperilled, and to fully reoj>en to intelligent and virtuous immi grants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, in a great degree, closed to gem ral immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it is recommended that the Gov ernnu nt of the Territory of Utah be reorganized. i end that Congress provide for the gov- rnment of Utah by a Governor and Judges; or Comm -sinners, appointed by the President and confirmed 1 y the Senate—a government mu logons to the provisional government estab lis'uc- i for the territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordiuaue. of 1787. If. however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government. I recommend that the right t< > vote, hold office, and sit on juries in the Ti rri t ry f Utah be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough nu snr* s are adot ted. it is believed that within a ft w years the evils which now afflict Utah will 1 e eradicated, and that this Territory will in go->vl time become one of the most prosper ( u- and attractive of the new States of the Union. Our relations with all foreign countries have Veen those of undisturbed peace, an 1 Lave presented no occasion for concern as to their v- ntinued maintenance. My anticipation of as early reply from the R- : ,-h Government to the demand of in demnity to our fishermen for the injuries -offered by Hitt Industry at Fortune bay, in luary, >7-. which 1 expressed mj -t annual Message, was disappointed. Tina >" r was received only in the latter parf 7 April in the present year, ami. Ti**n ted a fai • I etwee* ■ i Governments, as to the measure of - - - •r*-lisbing privilege sectured to our :i hy the treaty of Washington, o t - ■ s- riuus a character that 1 made it the subject of a oouiinunicaUoa to Congress, yj winch I recommended the adoption of the measures which seemed to me proper to bo taken by this Government in maintenance of the ri -hta accorded to ear fishermen under the treaty, and toward semring an indemnity foi the injury these interrda had suffered. A biV to carry out these reconmeadatioua was undr cons. i. ration by the H*nse of Representatives at the tune of the adjouument of Congress in June last. V. it hm a few weeks I have received a com muaication from her Majesty’s Oovemment, r. uewing the cunsn.niliiu of the subject, both of the indemnity for ths injiuies at Fortune l av, and of the interpretation of the treatv in which the previous correspondence had shown the two Governments to be at variance. Upon l)th these topics the imposition toward a friendly agreement is niarifested by a recogni tion of our right to an indemnity for the trans action at Foituuo bay, having the measure of such indemnity to furthe* conference, and by an assent tothe view of this Government, presented hi the previous com -pordence, that the r* tion of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of tin■ provincial seacoass. and the vessel fish ery of our fish* rmon. sl ould he made the sub ject of conference and concurrent arrangement betw. en tlie two Governments. I sincerely hope that the basin may he found for a sjHjcdy adjustmout of the very serious di vergence of views in tin interpretation of the fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspondence between the two Governments stood at th* last session of Con gress, seemed to lie irreconcilable.

At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries, at Berlin, the participation of the I mted States, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at large the principal prize of honor offered by His Majesty, the Emperor. The results of tins great success can not but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been some questions raised between the two Govern ments as to the proper effect and interpretation ol our treaties of naturalization, out recent dispatches from our Minister at Berlin show that favorable progre-s is making toward an understanding, in accordance with the views of this Government, which makes and admits no distinction between tin-rights of a native and naturalized citizen of the United States. In practice, tin- complaints of molestation suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present. There is nothing of importance to note iu our unbroken friendly relations with the Gov ernments of Amina-Hungary. Bussia, Portu gal. Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. During the last summer several vessels be longing to the merchant marine of this coun try, -ailing in neutral waters of the West In dies. w. re tin and at, boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government. The circumstances, as reported, involve not only a private injury to the per sons concerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly r lations existing for n irutMiT between tin* country ami Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish Government in a s* riona protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such explanation cr reparation as may be called for by the facts. The commission sitting in this city for the adjudication of claims of our citizens against the Government of Spain i-. I hope, approach ing th< tei min *tion of its lal ors. The claims against the United States under the Florida treat;, with Spain wa re submitted to Congress for its action at the late session, and again invite your attention to the long standing question, with a view to the final dis position of the matter. At the invit Hum of the Spanish Government, a conference has recently been h<dd at the cii\ ef Madrid to consider the subject of protec tion by foreign powers of native moors in the empire of Morocco. The Minister of the United States, in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of th s conferon - e, the result of which is a conven tion signed on behalf of all the powers repie sented. Th* instrument will be lid before tin Senate for its consideration. The Government 1 f the I mted States hi.s l*;.-t no opportmdtv t.. urge n|x)n that of the Emperor of Morocco the neees ity, in accordance with the Immune and enlightened spirit of the age. of putting an end to the persecutions, which have been -o preva lent in that country, of persons of a faith other than the M os’era. and especially of the !{.•- hr* w residents of Morocco. 'I he Consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officially promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word m the text by the Senate of the United States, which occasioned ' - ■■ ■ h the time allowed for rata expired. L’be Senate will be asked to extend the period for ratification. 'I he at’einpt to negotiate a treaty of extra dition with Denmark failed on account of the o jeetion of th*- Danish Government to the u-u.’i Cause providing that each nation should pav the expense of the arrest of the persons whose extradition it asks. Iho provision made by Congress, at its la-t e. ssion. for the expen-* of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the Imperial Government of China, on f-uhj* ts of great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the Commissioners to proceed at once upon their mi--ion. The Imperial Government was pre pared to give prompt and respectful atten tion to the matters brought under negotia tion. and the conferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of November last, two treaties ware signed at IV kin. one relating to the introduction of Chi nese into this country, and one relating to com merce. Mr. Trescot, one of the Commission* is. is now on Die way home bringing th** tre .ti*-s, end it is expected that they will be received in season to he laid before the Senate early in January. Our Minister in Japan has negotiated a eon v* ntion for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress the propriety of making provis ion for th* erection of suitable fire-proof build ings at the Japanese capital for the use of the American legation, and the Court House and jail connected with it. The Japanese Govern ment, with groat generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligible piece of land. In my last annual message I Invited the at tention of Congress to the subject of the in demnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. 1 renew the recommenda tion then made.that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citizens should be promptly paid, and the residue returned to the nations, resnectivt Iv. to which they justlv and equitably belong. Th* extradition treaty with the kingdom of the N* IL* Hands, whi* h has been for some tin e in course of negotiation, has. during the pa-t year, been concluded and duly ratified. F* lations of friendship and amity have been established between the Government of the Unit* and States and that of Roumama. We have s* n diplomatic represents tiv* to Bucharest, and have received at this capital th* special Envoy who has be* n charged by lus Royal Highaes- Prince Charles to snnounc the inde pendent sovereignty of Roumama. We hope for a speedy development of commercial rela tions between the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed th* hope that the prevalence of quietude on tin border U-tween this country and Mexico won. i soon become go assured as to justify tic modi fication of the orders, then in force, t • m military commanders, in regard to cross ing the frontier, without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger IF* peace of the two countries. Events nu *■ t in accordance with these exp; ctations. a;* I the orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our citizens and tho M* xican Gov* inmc.it. Kubseauentlv th** i>eae* of tho border was again disturbed by •• savage foray, under the command of the Chief Vietorm l ut, by the com ined and bam ni ;- f both Q has been broken up and substantially de stroyed. There i- reason to believ that the o! stacles which have so long prevented rapid and con venient communication between th* United States and Mexico by railway- are on the joint of disappearing, and that several imjK*rtaut ■ prises of tl • nil s- ■ B foot which cannot fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries. N* w Envoy - fr.cn Guatemala, f’oloml in.

The relations between tliis Government and United States of t v en gag <1 pubic attention during the past ve;r. mainly by reason of the projeet of aa iiiter oceanic ••anal acrus- the 1-timms of Fanama, to bo built by private capital ui cession from the Colombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations sub sisting between the United States and Col ombia, by which we guarantee the n> utral ity of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in th*- isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in toe region rail rae: and iu tnis guarantee should he effected— transforming, as it would, this isthmus, from a I an ier between th*- At I* ntic and Pacific oceans. Into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the navies and merchant ships of the world —should receive the approval of this Government, as being compatible w\ the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the principal com mercial power of the Western hemisphere. The views which i expressed iu a special message to Congress in March last, in relation to thi> project, I deem it my duty ogam to press upon your attention. Subse quent consideration has but confirmed tho • pinion “that it is tin-right and duty of the United States to a—rt and maintain such snpervi-iuii and authority over any Inter oceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our national interest,” The war between tho republic of Chili ou the one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and foil via on the oth* r, still continues. This Gov- lot felt called \ erfere in • contest that is within tlbelligerent rights of he parties as independent states. We have, However, always held ourselv* - in readiness to ltd in accommodating their difference, and have *.* diff* rent times reminded both belligerents of sur willingness to render such service. Our good offices in this direction were re cently accepted by all tho belligerents, and it m ' ed they would provi > fficacions ; bnt * regret to armounoo that tho measures which the Ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not success ful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights ; in all of these the Ministers of the United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in protection of American inteiest. The relations of tho United States with the empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, sini their commercial intercourse steadily in creases. to their mutual advantage. The internal disorders with which the Argen tine Republic has for some time past been afflicted, and which have more or less influ enced its external trade, are understood t*> have been brought to a close. This happy result may ho expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that republic as well as to the development of its vast’ interior •e sources. In Samoa, the Government of King Mali etoa, under the sujiport and recognition of tho Consular representatives of the United States, Great Britain and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquillity to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite local government, which has been proposed, (h>* common interests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in their rela tions to the native frame of government, and l id- may be be-t h*-cur* and by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would l. well if tin.- <' insular jurisdiction of our representative .*t Ap a were increased in extent and import ance so as to guard American interests in the sin rounding and outlying islands of Oceanica. The obelisk, generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of New York, has arrived safe iy in this country, and will soon he erect* *1 in that metropolis. A commission for th* liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this Govermue t, at tho earnest solicitation of th ■ Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted I y it. which will he laid before Con gress for its information. A commission for the revision of the judicial code of the reform tribunal of Egypt is now in session at Cairo. Me. Furman, Consul General, and J. M. Batch eld* r. E-q., have been appointed as Commis sioners to ; larticipate in this work. The orgau izatiuiiof tic reform tribunals will probably be continued tor another period of five vears. In pursuance of the act passed at the last "s ion*>f Congress, imitations have been ex t* nded to foreign maritime states to join in a solitary conference in Washington, beginning the Ist of January. The acceptance of this unit tion by many prominent powers gives ruinisc of success in this important measure, design* 1 to establish a system of international notification by which the spread of infections or epidemic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevented. The attention of ('on er* - - is invited to the necessary appropriations for ear n ing into effect the provisions of the act. The efforts of the Department of State to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of Consular officers ami through the dissemination of in formation obtained from them, have been un it-lax* and. The interest in these efforts, as de velop, and in our commercial communities, and tho value of the information secured by this means to the trade and manufactures of the country, were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publica tion of Consular and other reports by th* I> ■ Client of State. The first issue of this publication lias now been prepared, and sun equent issues may regularly he expected. I’he importance and interest attached to th*; re port- of Consular offi vrs are witnessed by tho g* m nil demand for them by all classes of mer chants and manufacturers engaged in our fcr eam trade. It is believ'd that the system of such publications is deserving of the approval of Congr* -s. and that the necessary appropria tion- It r its continuance and enlargement will commend itself to your consideration. The prosperous energies of our domestic in dustries, rad th* ir immeuce production of the subjects of foreign commerce*, invite, and even require, an active development of the wishes and interests of our people in that direction. F.sp* ■ Elly important is it that our commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico should he direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should be carried on in our own l*ottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities w hich our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan,China and the East Indies, w ith Australia and th** island groups which lie along the routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to onr own -hip ping. and to administ* r by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade. Whatever i cations of onr regulations of trade and naviga tion may be necessary or useful to meet and direct these impulses to the enlarge ment of our exchanges and of our car rying Hade, I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to supply. On- initial measure, however, seems to Is* so clearly use ful and efficient that I venture to pr* - it up* n your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular steam postal communication. by aid from Govern ment, has been the for* runner of the commer cial predominance of Great Britain on all th -e coa-ts and -eas. a greater share in whose trade i- now the desire and intent of onr people. It is also manifest that the efforts of ot lie r Eu ropean nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their adoption of regular sb-am-postal communica tion with the markets whose trade they sought. M* xico and the states of South Ann ;.*a are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country, and to aid in their develop ment. Similar cu operation may be looked for. in due time, from the Eastern nations and from Anstr. lia. It is diffi nit to - h>w this movement cat : privat* interests. In re j-ec{ of ‘>mm* ree. qn t* as much as in internal tin a . ] *-'?;•! * mmunie .non seems necessar.iv a mat t i of ■ umr.ou and public administration, and thus p* running * . government. I resj> ••tfully rccomiTM ad to your prompt attention h j;;-t aid efficient measures as may condii■•* to tho development of our foreign Von. acre.,d ex changes and the building up f our cairviae tr d*. • b nnection I desii ■ . jest the -• w might he t xpactod enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific ocean were a transmarine cable laid from Francisco to the Sandwich i-lands, and thence to Japan at the north and Austra lia at the south. The great influence of *uch in- ans of communication on these routes of navigation, in developing and securing the due share of our Pa cific coast in the commerce of the world m- d no illustration or enforcement. It may be that such an enterprise, useful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private invest ment, may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation by Congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additional, and not nmmjxirtant, although secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable si-rvice to the expansion to our commerce, which ■vimid be rendered by the frequent circulation ■ and ports of al t ters of the globe. Ships of the propter •onstrnction and equipment, to bo of tic* greatest efficiency iu ease of mari time war, might be made cons ant nd active agents in time of peace in the ad v. uu nt and protection of our foreign trade and in the nurture and discipline of young sea men, who would, naturally, in some numbers, mix with and urcrove the crews of our mer chant-ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recognize the value to foreign com merce of an active movement of our naval ves sels, and the intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every interest of their couutryim-u is a jiirt subject of nation al pride. The condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by the report of the 8 en taryof the Treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the present flu i ncia 1 situa ted of ttie United States, whether considered with r* spect to trade, currency, credit, growing \v< alth, or tin- extent and variety of our re sources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been si u passed by that of any country at any ]*erio*l of its history. All our industries are thriving ; the rate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed ; a vast immigration is increasing our popula tion. capital, and labor; new enterprises in gr* at number are in progress ; and our com merce witn other com;tries is improving.

Thorn was applied thereto the sum of >73, y 01.617.41. being £35.- 972.973.86 in excess of the actual requirements for the year. The aggregate of the revenues from ali sources during the fiscal year ended June 3 

IHSII, was £333,520.610.98, an increase over the preceding yo.ir of $59,690,426.52. The r* ccipts thus fur, of the current year, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to 1359,000,000, which will bo sufficient to nnvt the estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a surplus of £00.(100.boo. It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue occurs at a period when it may be directly ap plied to the payment of the public debt soon to be redeemable. No public duty has b*en more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation’s debt as rap idly as possible. Fbe debt of the United States, less cash in the treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, attained us maximum of £2.756.431.571.43 in August, 1865, an 1 has since that time been re duced t<> £1.886.019,504.65. Of the principal of the debt £108,758.100 lias been paid since March 1, 1877. effecting an annual saving of interest of £6,107.593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest, and the applica tion of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds b* aring a high- r rate. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, is £14.290,453.50. Within a short period over £600,000.000 of 5 and 6-per-cent, bonds will become redeemable. Tins presents a very favorable opportunity not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the at tention of Congress to the views expressed on this subject by the Secretary of the Treasury in his annual report, and recommend prompt action, to enable the Treasury Department to complete the refunding of the debt winch is about to mature. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business and to our remarkable prosper.lv. The fears that preceded and ac companied resumption have proved ground less. No considerabl* amount of United States not"s have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the mints ;*;d exchanged for coin or notes. The in crease of com and bullion in the United States since ,In. 1. 1*79. jg estimated at £227,390.428. There are still in existence, oncancelled, £346,691.616 of United Staten legal-tender notes. These notes wore authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of th< nation’s existence required, in the judgment of Congr. an issue of legal-tender paper money. That it served well the purpose for which it was created is not question'd, but the employment of the notes as pape r money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of th. object for which they were provided, was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. These notes ■ • m 1 • ligation of th*- Governnw nt -a debt to !■* paid, and, when paid, to lie cancelled as mere evi dence of an indebtedness no longer existing. U tie r- for. , repeat what was said in the annual ■•<.-•* 1 ...-t year, that the retirement from lof United Stab notes, w ith the capacity of Jega; tender in private contracts, is, a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Gov ernment and the inti rest and security of the people. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value and giving them legal-tender character, it was believed by many of the sup porters of the measure that the silver dollar, which it authorized, would speedily la-come, under the operations of the law, of . qnivalent value to the gold dollar. Then were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted ; - to the probability of this result, nevertheless w. re willing to give the proposed experiment a fair trial, with n vnw to stop tlie coinage, if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continu'd to be of less commercial value than the standard gold dollar. The coinage of silver dollars, under the act referred to. began in March, 1878, am] has been continued an required by the act. The averag* rate (s r month to the present time has been £2,276,492. The total amount coined prior to the l-i of November last was £72.847 - this a ant $47, >84,45 > remai 1 m the treasury, and only $25,967,291 are in the hand- of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circu i.hmn. and considerable expense’has been .♦ceararLy incurred for this purpose, but tiifc treasury is prompt and ie. Contrary to tL© confident"anticipation $ the friends of the measure at the time or its adoption, the value of the silver d<.)la r containing U2}f grains cf silver, has not .••- creased. During the year pilot to the pa*sa ■ * of the bill authorizing its coinage, the mark' ? value of the silver which it contained was f.. 90 to 92 cents, as compared with the stand.,; ; gold dollar. During the last year the avfv. : , market vain-.: of the silver dollar has been - ■ It is obvious that the ’egislatlon ot the Congress in regard to silver, so far a- it based on an anticipated rise in the value • silver ns p. result of that legislation. Ims f; ,-j to produce the effect then predicted, longer the law remains in force, inquiring a does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is not a dollar, the greater bpconw* t ■ danger that this country will be forced to 5 cept a single metal as the sole legal stand.rj of value, in circulation, and this a standard ■ ■ less value than it purports to be worth in th* recognized money of the world. The constitution of the United States, s • n financial principles, and our beat interests. . requirt that the country should have as its tender money both gold and siht r coin, ■ f . : intrinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to t which, ujK'U its face, i: purports to poss, s constitution, in express terms, recognizes ' • gold and silver as the only true legal-t- • money. To banish either of these metals f; our currency is to narrow and limit thee;; latmg medium of exchange to the dis-j -r nunt of important interests. The United S; produces more silver than any other c try, and is directly interested in rnmit.. it as one of the two precious metals which ! nish the coinage of the world. It will, in n judgment, contribute to this result if Congr*-. will repeal so much of existing legilai;nn 3- rt quires the coinage of silver dollars, •on; n ing only 41 2U1 grains of silver, and in its su , will authorize the Secretary of tin ireasur • coin silver dollars of equivalent value as |'■, ion with g* Id dollars. This will defraud man, and will l*e in accordance with tan ; precedents Congress, on several oe. has altered the ratio of value between .; i silver, in order to establish it more v. ni accordance with the actual ratio of value' tween the two metals. In finaneial legislation every measure in p,. direction of greater fidelity in the discharg. * pecuniary obligations has been found by (\y rience to diminish the rates of interest wl debtors oiv r* quired lo pay. and to increase; facility with which money can be obtained f every legitimate purpose. Our own rev . financial history shows how surely money 1 comes abundant whenevt r confidence in the v aot performance of moneyed obligations is - tablished. Tlie Secretary of War reports that tla cj, peuditim s of the War Department for the cal year ended Juno 30, iMSrt, were $39.9ji 77H.03. The appropriations for this dep ment, for the current fiscal year, amount • $11,993,630.40. With respect to the array, the Secretnn vites attention to the fact that its strong: limited by statute ({Section 1,115, Revised s utes) to not more than 30.000 enlisted t; but tliat provisos contained in appnqi ..,- b;i!s have limited expenditures the enlistment of Lilt 25,000. It is l. that full legal strength is the least j force at which tin present organization r.,:. maintained, having in view efficiency, dis .. and economy. While the enlistment of force would add somewhat to the appr. • for pay of the army, the saving made in , ■ ~ respects would l>e more than an ••pm: ,t; this additional outlay, and the elli in. f; . army would be largely increased. The rapid extension of the railroad sy-;. west of the Mississippi river, and (he v- ■ tide of Settlers which has flowed in nj : t< rntory. impose on the military an *m - change of policy. The maintenance of sn posts along wagon and stage routes of u is no longer necessary. Permanent qn.ri at points selected, of a more subslar.; character than those heretofore con-tn. will be required. Under existing laws, j i manent buildings cannot be erected the sanction of Congress, and when - , military sites and buildings have been a;;” ized, the moneys received have rev to the treasury, and could ouly become able through anew appropriation. It is r* mended that provision be made, by a g* n. statute, for thes di of such abandoned ri poste and buildings as are found to b, m. . sary, and for the application < f the proce and • the construction of otb. r posts. Whil* m of the present posts are of but slight vain.-f military purposes, owing to lito changed iv turn of the country, their occupation U c■;;f: ued at great expense and inconvenience, cause they afford the only available shettei (■ - troops. The absence of a largo number of officer the line, in active duty, from their regiment- * a serious detriment to the maintenance of ; service. The constant demand for small d taohmeuts, each of which should be comma •dby a commissioned officer, and the v.ir. - details of officers for necessary service a v - r from their commands, occasions a scarcity ; the number required for company dm With a view to lessening this drain to s. s extent, it is recommended that the law am izing the detail of officers from the aetiv' as professors of tactics and military scione* certain colleges and universities be so amend' • as to provide that all such details be made f: the retired list of the army. Attention is asked to the necessity of r vidiug by legislation for organizing, arm and disciplining the a/tuv militia of thee try, and liberal appropriations are recomm it! this behalf. The rejsirts of the .1 General of the army and the Chiel nance touching this subject fully set l importance.
