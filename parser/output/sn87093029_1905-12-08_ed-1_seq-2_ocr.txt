BALFOUR AND CABINET RESIGN King Edward Accepts Same and In structs Campbell-Bannerman for Form New Cabinet. London, Deo s.—The political crisis in the United Kingdom has reached a climax Arthur J. Balfour, the pre mier, has formerly tendered the resig nations of himself and the members of his cabinet to King Edward, who ac cepted them. His majesty has iuvited Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to an interview, when he will offei him the mission of foiming a new cabinet. Sir Henry will accept the task, and within a few days a new government will be formed It may be stated as certain that Eord Rosebery will be entirely ingored in the makeup of the cabinet and that John Morley will be one of the chief advisers of Sir Henry in drawing up the list of his official family, which will be presented to his majesty. Mr. Morley himself is considered like ly to go to the Indian office, aud it is probable that Herbert Henry Asquith will be chancellor of the exchequer. The foreign affairs portfolio will go either to Lord Elgin or Sir Edward Grey, though the latter is considered likely to be made secretary of the colo nies. One thing is certain —that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has explained his attitude on home rule for Ireland to those liberal leaders who are known to be opposed to home rule on the lines of the last bills introduced in parlia ment. Since his speeoh at Stirling, which raised such a fuiore, Sir Henry has not made any statement, but it is confidently asserted in the liberal olubs that he is ready with a policy which will secure the adhesion of the British nationalists, and at the same time avoid raising the issuo of one of the prominent planks in his platform. There is some uncertainty as to when the dissulution of parliament will be effective, but it is not considered prob able until after the new year. An interesting feature of the politi cal situation is the prospect of a oloser alliance between the Irish and the labor parties in the new parliament. James Keir Hardie, the socialist and independent member, in a political speeoh tonight frankly invited suoh an alliance. He pointed out that 45 labor members combined with 75 Irish mem bers would provide a voting strength which no government, however strong, could afford to ignore. RECORD OF LIFE SAVERS. Thousands of Persons Rescued and Many Crafts Saved. The work of the life saving service for the last fiscal year is summed up in a repert of General Superintendent Kimball to the secretary of the treas ury, recently made public. The life saving crews saved and assisted In saving 464 imperiled vessels and their cargoes, besides affording assistance of more or less importance to 677 oth er vessels, including craft of all kinds, making a total of 1141 vessels to which aid was furnished. In addition, the report states, 83 steamers and 88 sail ing vessels running into danger were warned of their peril by the signals of the patrols and lookout in time to escape disaster. The saving of many lives and much property is attributed to such warnings. No less than 365 disasters to docu mented vessels occurred during the period stated, involving the lives of 4809 persons, of whom 27 were lost. The estimated value of vessels and cargoes so affected was $10,320,660, of which $7,917,385 was saved. Sixty three vessels were totally loßt. Succor was afforded at the various stations to 624 persons, to whom an aggregate of 1510 days' relief was furnished. Four hundred and twenty casualties were sustained by undocumented vessels, such as sail boats and row boats, in volving 955 persons, 10 of whom were lost. The value of property involved in these casualties is estimated at $264,690, of which $258,025 was saved. The report concludes with an earn est appeal for pensions to widows and children of members of the life sav ing crews losing their lives in the performance of duty and for retire ment when disabled from injury or dis ease incurred in the service.

CONGRESS RESUMED MONDAY'S SESSION BEGINNING OF MOST IMPORTANT MEETING. Message Tuesday?— Preliminary Work Only Will Occupy Attention for a Week—New Senators Appear—ln Upper House There Will Be Four to Take the Oath. Very little besides the organization of the house will be accomplished the first week of the session, although it is possible that an emergency appro priation for the Panama canal may be passed the last of the week. Un til the committees are appointed such a bill would have to be considered by unanimous consent or under a special order. The leaders of the house have been informed that the emergency appropri ation will not be needed until Decem ber 25, and consequently the bill may not be passed until next week. Monday was taken up with the elec tion of a speaker and other house of ficers. It is already understood that the rules of the last house will be adopted, as the members have been sworn in. The biennial lottery for seats was an interesting occasion on the first day, and at its conclusion ad journment followed. Tuesday was de voted to the reading of the president's message, and that closed the real busi ness of the house for the week. Speaker Cannon has not yet com pleted his committees, but it is expect ed he win be ready to announce them early in the session. Bills will be Introduced every day that the house is in session from the beginning, and will be printed and re ferred to the committees when ap pointed. It is expected that many im portant propositions will be presented during the early days of the session. Work in Senate. Nothing but preliminary work will engross the attention of the senate this first week of the session. The senate is already organized, as it is a continuous body, and besides, there was a special session last spring, when the new senators were sworn in. Senators Brandegee of Connecticut, Warner of Missouri, Frazier of Ten nessee and LaFollette of Wisconsin have not yet taken their oaths. The two former had not been elected when the special session adjourned. Monday was a very short session and the senate adjourned out of re spect for the late Senator Piatt of Con necticut as soon as the necessary for malities for the beginning of a new congress have been concluded. Tues day the president's message was re ceived and read, and Wednesday was devoted to the introduction of bills. A short session was held Thursday, and the senate then adjourned until the following Monday. 

MILLIONS SPENT IN ELECTIONS. Immense Sums Spent During Presi dential Campaigns. The Washington Post prints under a New York date what is declared to be an authoritative statement of the cam paign fund raised by the republican national committee during the last presidential canvass and the manner of its distribution. The statement shows an approxi mate aggregate of 11,900,000 was rais ed and expended. The figures for the McKinley cam paign of 1900 are given as $2,800,0000 and for 1896 as $3,800,000.

The largest individual contribution was $75,000 or $100,000, the funds be ing turned in by a member working on one of Treasurer Bliss' committees, who did not know who furnished the money. IN DARK AS TO MOSCOW. Last News From There Is of Pillage and Arson. Berlin, Dec. s.—Absence of news from Moscow leads to the worst con clusions in respect to that city's fate. The latest information was that the old capital was in the hands of mobs that sacked and burned all the gov ernment buildings, and the police and Cossacks pillaged the imperial gran eries and cut the telegraph wires. It is evident the last line of communica tion was severed at least 24 hours ago and that Moscow is isolated, not only from the world, but from the remain der of Russia. Disarm Naval Battalions.

Despite all the denials at the meet ing of the American league in Chicago oi any amalgamation between the Na tional and American leagues there are some of the magnates who honestly believe that some such move will be made. It now looks as though Matty Fitz patrick would be the next match for Honey Melody. The Chicago boy has been trying to get a go with Gardner or Sullivan, but has about given up hope as the two latter men claim to be lightweights. Now Fitzpatrick comes out with the statement that he is after Mellody and wants to fight the Boston boy in San Frnacisco.

J. —Army 6, navy 6. While the army-navy football game Saturday was probably one of the most exciting ever played between the two institutions, it was simply a side show to the social football event of the season. The 25,000 people saw the game. From all sections of the United States came spectators who or dinarily would not travel a score of miles to see a football contest. All this was doubtless brought about by the fact that President Roosevelt was to be present. Standing at end of Pacific coast league season: P. C.
