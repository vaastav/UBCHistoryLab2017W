The Democratic Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1905. Several Senators Absent. When the roll was called in the United Stales Senate on Monday, at the assembling of the Fifty ninth Congress, several Republi caus did not answer to their names. The chief absentees were John 11. Burton of Kan sas and John H. Mitchell of Oregon. Burton was indicted, convicted and sen tenced for using his influence, for a money consideration, with the PostofKce Department, to protect a grain swindling company from being excluded from the use of the mails. Mitchell was indicted, convicted and sentenced for complicity in public land frauds. Both have taken appeals, but they felt their pres ence, as convicts, would be at least distaste ful, and their retirement might be requested. Another absentee was Senator La Follette, of Wisconsin, lie is Governor of the State and used the position to have himself elected Senator, to show his power over the two Sen ators from the State, who opposed him in his contest for Governor. After the election he aspired to the United Stales Senate, and was elected to succeed Joseph V. Quarles, whose term expired last March. He did not attend the special session last spring, but held his position of Chief Executive for personal rea sons. At a special session of the Wisconsin Legislature, which opened Monday, he told that body he would relinquish the Governor ship during its present session, or sit its end, and then enter the Senate. A vacancy exists from Delaware, because the Legislature would not elect Gas Addicks. The latter was able to hold enough votes to defeat any other aspirant, and he deadlocked the contest until the term of the session ex pired. A Senator who did answer the roil call was Chauncey M. Depew, of New York, whose character was badly besmirched by the inves tigation of tin* largest life insurance companies of New York. He has been proven a grafter and accepted an annual salary of $20,000 a year for which he rendered no service, Chauncey was present with his smile and handsome clothes. He was no! abashed. A $20,000 a year graft was just the correct thing. He probably wishes it had been more. These are some of the leading lights in the “Grand Old Parly," which Speaker Cannon, at the House Republican caucus last Saturday night so highly eulogized as a parly of purity, principles and progress. Certainly some of the office holders have been progressing. Rascality prevails in every department of gov ernment, and a few departmental officials are serving light sentences in tin- penitentiary. A Lively Session. The present session of Congress promises to be interesting from start to finish. The President’s message covered almost every subject conceivable, from tin- preservation of the buffalo to the regulation of railroad rates and supervision of insurance companies and fraternal insurance societies. Already bills to carry out the President’s variety of notions have been introduced, nine-tenths of which will find permanent lodgement on the files of the committees to which they have been re ferred. Even in the staid Senate over eight hundred hills were introduced on Wednesday. The debates in the House this week have been quite lively, and give indication of still more spirited ones when real work begins. The House is more likely to yield to the President than the Senate. In the House debate is limited and the big majority can rush a caucus measure through in short order. There is more deliberation in the Senate, and time is given for full discussion. The President is dogmatic and persistent, bnt he will find that lie will either have to yield some of his notions, or have them over ridden.

Franklin, as tax collector of Westminster district, was accepted, but the order accepting it distinctly slated that it did not in any manner release him or his bond from any liability under the law as such tax collector.

Mr. Dehoff, the retiring commissioner made a most excellent officer, as efficient as any the county has had in a quarter of a century. He has been careful and prudent, discriminating between niggard ness and true economy. While always firm, he was affable and agreeable to all having business with the commissioners. UNION MILLS ITEMS. Celebration of the 25th Anniversary of Moorhead M. E. Church—Personals, Etc. December 6. —The 26th anniversary of the Moorhead M. E. Church, at this place, was observed on Saturday and Sunday, November 25 and 20, last. This church was dedicated on the 24th day of October, 1880. It was built mainly by the untiring efforts and zeal of the late Rev. I. N. Moorhead, who was then on the Littlestown Circuit, which at that time had six appointments, but by the zeal for the work of his Master he found time to hold preaching services in the academy at this place every two weeks on Friday evening. In January, 1880, a class of 10 was organized by him, and at once plans were made for the erection of a church. It was a hard struggle for the little band of 10, but being inspired by their pastor, after many sacrifices, the church was built and paid for in due time. The services on Saturday evening partook of the nature of a platform meeting. After singing, and prayer by Rev. Joseph A. Gray, a lorrner pastor, Mr. Hamilton Forrest, ot Littlestown, Pa., told of bow he, with other brethren of the same place, came here and held religious services in the schoolhouse more than 40 years ago, and how they had at inter vals been bolding these meetings until the erection of the church. Mr. Forrest was followed by Mr. Abia Smucker, of the same place. Mr. Smucker told of the work of the late John Mcllvame, one of the pioneers of Methodism at Littles town, who as early as ]Bsti held religious ser vices near this place, iu “Shull’s Pines, and thus first introduced Methodism in this place. Mr. Smucker was followed by Mr. J. Burgeon, who alter speaking more definitely of the dates and facts ot these meetings, gave a brief his tory of the church, from the earliest concep tion of the project to the present time, speak ing of the trials, hinderances, difficulties and sacrifices of the little organization, and its final triumph in completing the church and paying every cent of its indebtedness. Rev. Joseph Gray, of Arbisonia, Pa., was the last speaker of the evening. He said the history of Methodism at this place was much like its history everywhere—it would spring up, be crushed to the earth, spring un again only to he crushed again, but the germ was not destroyed and finally it sprung up, bloomed and yielded an abundant harvest. Alter singing, and the benediction by Rev. J. W. Lung, the present pastor, the meeting closed. On Sunday morning at 9.80 there was love feast. which was participated in by the visiting brethren and local members. Mr. Win. F. Burgeon, of Harrisburg, Pa., spoke very touchingly of his conversion at the altar of this church, and how it had influenced his life for good ever since. The lovefeast was followed by an eloquent, earnest and forcible sermon by the young pastor. Rev. J. W. Long. Sun day evening at 0.80 there was an enthusiastic E. meeting, followed by an earnest and impressive sermon by Rev. Win. Hirons, of | the Wilmington (Delaware) Conference. R. N.
