The New York Times of Sunday has the following about the new corner ; “Dining the forenoon and in the early part of tln> day William Travers covered lib shorts, paying, it is alleged, $250,000 difference (.’hurley Lament stood up o> the rack, also, and paid his ditVerenet s, amounting to nearly the same sum. These contracts were settled on the basis of $1.50. The highest estimate of the amount of stock of winch Dana 1 Drew is short is 27,000 shares, and the lowest 10,000. Should he settle in full upon the closing price of new, l.e w ill lose nearly $2,500,000. ('orntuon nun r said 11. N. Smith was slout 10,000 shares, which will involve him to a greater extent than Daniel Drew. The opinion was freely exprt ■ i on tin- street that he would not pay his losses in full, but let his brokers stand the brunt of the contracts. It is said Du \v was caught in the trap by a device of Gould’s, ingenious in its way. Gould went to Grew a lew weeks 1 ago and. supi sted the possibility of singing the street in I'.rie, in which transaetion tlie latter was to appear as a bull. Drew joined in with the idea,, and went to work aeeretlv to buy up large blocks of I’.rie, looking them up in safes as fast as purchased. The stook of this market was soon gobbled up, and, as a consequence, the price of Krie began to advance. Gould also bought Krie largely at low tigures on the streets, but abstained from pur chasing any when it began to ad vance. The stock rose to S(U, and Gould unloaded his entire interest upon Drew, thereby netting a consid erable protit. Drew, ignorant of the bad faith of his ally, and wondering it the large quantities of Erie stock which continued to flow in as he kept on purchasing went it alone, and was making fair progress m building the nket on his own account, when Gould turned anew e rd. In some way lie become acquainted with the fact that the Harry T. Clark, August Schell and \ underbill party gener ally were endeavoring to obtain con trol of the Chicago and Northwestern stock in order to get the road into their own hands, and supply the mis sing link in the great railroad chain to the West. He thereupon formed a coalition with the North western clique, and. going to Drew, who still supposed he was helping to bull Erie, suggested that as a blind to their real operations it would be a good plan (ago short in Northwestern and thereby throw the street otV the scent. Drew, relying upon the judgement of ins quondam associate' in Erie, acqui t seed in this arrangement, merely say scJl of Northwestern, and it might tickle i the boys to speculate in something new. ; His brokers executed his orders, and j the design was accomplished. The at- j tenticn of Drew became absorbed in the : success of the Erie bull movement, j and while he was watching the j rise of the stock he paid little attention i Hi Northwestern. Gould found that i Drew was trapped, and kept away, oc 1 cupying his leisure moments in engi- i nee ring the rise. Friday night Drew, speaking to a Times reporter, and still j entertaining some hopes of a decline in Northwestern, remarked jocosely, “1; heard Northwestern has risen.” Yes-1 terday, at the close of Exchange, when Northwestern reached 230, the remark was made to Drew: “ Northwestern is rising.” ” Rising,” responded Drew, “ rising, why it has riz. ' Drew, real izing the perfidy of Gould, fully, yes terday, sold out the Erie stock, which lie bought to skiu the streets, and, it is supposed, will use the proceeds to set tle up with the successful parties. He also unloaded a large amount of Wabash and various other stocks. It is expected he will settle on Monday. At the Fifth Avenue Hotel last night there was considerable excitement i among hankers, merchants and brokers, caused by various reports which were circulated relative to the arrest of Gould, and its connection with the Chi cago and Northwestern corner. The story, as it gained ciranlution, was that the Erie company had determined to arrest Gould again, that lie might be held in greater hail than one million. This was contradicted in several quar ters, but there seemed to be no ade quate grounds either for the assertion or denial. Watson, President of the Erie, stated that it was the intention to have the bail made large enough to in some way guard against Gould’s run ning away, but that was his only ob ject, and totally disconnected with stock jobbing. Watson thought, that one million was sufficient bail for the present, although he deprecated the custom of diminishing bail, as the pro portion of a defalcation may increase, i'tiere is much interest manifested con cerning the events of to-morrow in Wall street, and the anxiety in regard to the course of the market is intense.” The World says: “ We are greatly mistaken in the character of Mr Wat son if, having once grappledwith this crying curse to our country in the per son of one of its most n ttorious repre sentatives, lie does not keep his hold with bull-dog tenacity until he has brought his quarry to the earth.” 1 he Navy. The Navy Department will soon offer for sale, in accordance with the act of last session, a large number of uti sorviteuble vessels for which there can be no further use, and which are not worth the cost of maintenance. The Hoard of Inspection have designated among the vessels to bo thus disposed id the Delaware and Guerriere, which will be sold on the 12th of December; and, in addition, the Niagara, first class; lowa, Nevada, Illinois, and Sev ern, of the second ; and Nantucket! and Resaea, of the third.

Tensgua, Wassuc, Yazoo, and Yoma, all of which are now hud up at i the various navy yards, and also on the | list for sale, and will be disposed of as rapidly as convenient. All of these iron-elads are past further use for 1 any purpose, and valuable only I for tin' iron and material which they contain. From ten to twenty t thousand dollars on oh is all they are 1 expected to realize. The Department will also discharge a large proportion of its workmen in the navy yards and reduce its expenses fur the remainder of tue’year. From one-third to oue foiuth of the force in the Charlestown yard will probably be relieved at an early date. It is understood that the Department will ask next year for *lO,- yOO,OOO, of which one-half will be ex pended in the construction of ten steam sloops of war, which it is confi dently expected Congress, early in the next session, will authorize. 1 he ‘'igual Service. \\ itli the view of diminishing the expenses of the signal service, and at the same time possessing the power of suddenly increasing the number of statioi s from which reports arc to be had in any section of the country which may at any season of tho year be espe cially threatened by storms, which at dillerent seasons seem to pass more frequently over particular portions of the territories n; the United States, the organisation ot a mobilized corps of observers has been commenced. This corps, which will consist of picked men. skillful and chosen for their special Illness for its contemplated duties, will be equipped with portable apparatus comprising all in struments that will be required for use at any station to which they may be suddenly ordered. The stations will be properly occupied in each section of tbc country in reference to the storms to which that section is habitu ally exposed at particular seasons, and will be designated in advance and pro per telegraph connections for those stations be previously arranged. It wall be possible to occupy in this way the stations with great rapidity The period of danger for which they may be occupied being passed, they will be abandoned, and the force left free to be transferred for the protection of other sections whose seasons of danger may be then approaching. lin Princess Mathilde, who was ex tremely partial to Thco| hilo Gautier, went to ste him laid out after death. and v enf ; bruuburth..

DEVIL FLSH. Capture of tine hI KomivUlu-A Carios ity of Xat Ural History. Alluding to the report that in Bona vista harbor a gigantic cuttle-fish was captured, measuring thirty feet from ■ the tip of the horns to the extremity of the tail, and having a bill, the top of which resembles that of the largest, eagle, and the under part that of a par-; rot, a correspondent of the St, John (N. S.) Telegraph says: “If the captor of this thirty-feet cuttle could have procured enough rum to preserve it (no easy job certainly), it would have been a fortune to him. Barnura and Agassiz would bid against each other furiously for possession of the creature, and the managers of the I British Museum would have sent out an agent to compete. Perhaps the highest bidder of all, provided he is in pocket just now, would have been Vic tor Hugo; as he could confront the world with this, and prove that his celebrated devil fish, in the ‘Toilers of the Sea,’ is no fanciful creature, and that 'fact is stronger than fiction.’ That some specimens of the cuttle-fish have attained enormous dimensions is well established. In oriental tales, they are represented as throwing their arms over a ship’s hull, and dragging her under water; and some of the older naturalists accepted these stories as true. There are, however, well authenticated instances of divers in the Indian seas bavin# been caught in tbo long, lithe anna of this tish, with their cold adhesive powers, and held by the monster in its clammy embrace till life ( was extinct. Nothing can be more hor rible and repulsive than one of the large \ cuttle-fish, with its flabby, corpse like fleshiness, its livid hue that comes and goes so strangely, its uicouth agility and its ghastely green eyes that are enough to paralyze its victim. Its head protrudes from a muscular sac, and is distinct from the body. The mouth is armed with a pair of homey mandibles, resembling the bill of a parrot. Sur rounding the mouth are the tentacular appendages or arms, which serve at once for instruments of locomotion and or gans for seizing and holding of prey. They are eight in number, each being I supplied with a double row of sucking disks, which act on the principle of a cupping glass, and being applied to any surface, adhere to it, at tlie will of the animal, with such force that it is easier to tear away the substance of the Hmh than release it from its attachment. Each of its eight arms carries one hun dred and twenty pair of sucking disks. Flinging out a pair of these teutncula, the cuttle seizes its victim which, in its struggles, comes in contact with more and more of the fatal disks in succes sion, til! it is powerless in the grip of its enemy, whose sharp, horny beak soon tears it to peees. I am inclined to think that the correspondent has been accurate in his measurements, or has accepted second-hand statements. This much, however, is certain—that gigantic cuttle has been captured, ox dimensions sufficiently large euougii to satisfy the most devoted lover of the marvelous. ” Suburban New York. Quite a spirited contest is going on at flu' present moment in the thriving towns of West Farms,Yonkers, Morris auia and West Chester, as to whether t hey shall he consolidated under one government, or continue their individ ual existence. Morrisania includes no less than Ifl separate villages, West Farms has 10, and West Chester and Yonkers us many more. All have sep arate municipal government, with a separate indebtedness from 

SSOO to a $1,000,000. One party favors the con s didatiou of towns, and an independ ent government, while another pro poses to annex the whole to New York at once, and possess the privileges of that city—the right to gas, water, po lice and municipal government —with- out a separate expense. The subject will come before the New York Legis lature this winter. African Exploration. At a meeting of the Koval Geographi cal Society in London. November 11, tin 1 President, Major General Sir Hen ry Rawlinson, said in his inaugural; “ Let it be understood, once for alt, that there is not the remotest ground for questioning the accuracy of Mr. Stanley’s statement of his meeting with Livingstone. So satisfied are Living stone’s friends in England that the Ln alaba River is identical with the Con go. that they have originated an inde pendent relief expedition, to be called the Livingstone Congo Expedition, which will rendezvous at St. Paul do Loando, and have the cordial support of the Portuguese authorities.

A pleasant little incident is related of Miss Clara Louise Kellogg, which occurred while visiting the Grindel wald glacier in Switzerland, during her late tour. Her party encountered, us other travelers do, a young Italian Swiss, who earned a precarious exist ence by frantic efforts to rouse an echo from the opposite cliffs by means of an awkward horn. After straining every muscle he brought forth u melancholy toot, with no great effect upon the op posite crags. Miss Kellogg watched for some time his vain endeavors, and then, rising in the carriage, she gave one of the charming mountain jodels, finishing off with a specimen of those inimitable trills which require no patent to render them unapproachable. In an instant came back lour or five beauti fully perfect echoes, with an imperti nently clear trill at the end. The young Italian doffed his hat, and ex claimed : “ Ah, madamo, could 1 but make an echo like that my fortune here would be made." An Eccentric Heiress. A Lidv residing iu Clifton, HrisUd (Eng land), of good family, and enjoying a for tune in her own right, has just conferred her hand upon a young man of the hum bler class, who hilhertfi lias had no higher occupation than attending the “leader" of an omnibus, and attaching drags to the wheels of carriages. Ibe lady in ques tion, it appears, was a district visitor, and in that capacity visited ihe houses of the poor in a populous district of Clif ton. In the course of these visits she happened to call upon this voung man's mother, who has hoen until recently an invalid, Mini was so much struck with the filial attend' n and affectionate disposition of the youth, that she took notice of him from time to time.

The Supreme Question.— Health is the most important of earthly bless ings, nml therefore the nervous anxiety of the sick to ascertain the relative merits of the various medicines in use is not surprising. With the last two years many thousands of invalids have abandoned the preparations of the phanuacopolist for the remedy intro duced by Dr. Walker, of California, under thersomewhat eccentric name of Vinegar Bitters. That this new Veg etable medicine is “winning golden opinions of all sorts of people” is be yond a doubt. The accounts we hear of its extraordinary effects in cases of chronic dyspepsia, rheumatism, liver complaints, malarious fevers, nervous prostrations and many other distress ing diseases, certainly justify the pop. ularity which it has everywhere ac quired. Dr. Walker claims for his specific a remedial power over all disorders that do not involve an irreparable destruc tion of bone and fibre, and results so far appear to have justified the claim. In this age of wonders we are not dis posed to deny the possibility of any phenomena nut directly at variance with the laws of nature, and as i is held by many physiologists that all maladies proceed from the same gene, ric cause, we see no reason for the in credulity with which some people re gard the idea of a Universal Medicine. Dr. Walker’s preparation seems des lined to be universally approved.—Com. Quebec is to-day the most quaint looking city on the North American continent, with its ancient cathedrals, churches, convents, monasteries and market places; its little, old-fashioned and dilapidated dwellings, low one and two story houses, plastered and painted both in white and dingy colors, with bright green shutters and high and steep red tile or bright unpainted tin roofs, with queer little dormer windows peeping out of them, and tall chim neys topping high over the gable ends.
