TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 10, 1901. BANK IN FUR EAST re American Institution to Be Established. ENTRUSTED TO N. Y. CAPITALISTS Government MeekliiK' Hellef From lCmbarrtiHHiiiK uiul Humilia tiutc <omlitioii». Special to The Journal. Chicago, Dec. 10.—A Washington special to the Tribune says: The establishment of a great American banking institution in the far east is about to be realized with the cordial co-operation of the govern ment at Washington, so far as assistance van be given under existing laws and un der legislation that is being urged upon the present congress. The enterprise is understood to command the enormous cap ital indispensable to enable it to compete with great foreign institutions strongly intrenched on the other side of the Pa cific. The Guaranty Trust company, of New- York has been selected by Presideut Roosevelt's cabinet to undertake the re sponsibilities at Shanghai, Hongkong, and eventually at Manila and other eastern ports, and already officials of that cor poration have been sent out to survey the field and to make preliminary arrange ments for beginning business about the first of the year, when they will be called upon to receive the first installment of the Chinese indemnity at Shanghai. Their plans are not fully known here, but the administration has been satisfied with the company's full responsibility and its ear nestness, and there is no fear that the company will not be ready to receive full authority to handle the Chinese fund when the payment is forthcoming and become the custodian of all civil and military funds at Manila In a short time. The desirability of such a bank, cap italized and controlled by Americans, has long ben apaprent to the interests doing business with the orient, but not until the Philipines came under the jurpisdic tion of the United States did the national government become aware of the great necessity, through being placed in the humiliating position of absolute depend ence for banking facilities on two power ful English corporations and compelled to transact its business with them, including the "handling of the large funds required by the army and navy. Frequently these transactions involved the application by ihese banks of rates of exchange that were regarded exorbitant, and many op portunities »rose for them seriously to hamper the fiscal operations of the gov ernment. 

GOUDIE" WAS GULLIBLE "WORKED" FOR IMMENSE! SU'.iS Liverpool Bank Clerk One at the Smoothest Proposition* Crooks Ever Encountered. Hew York Sun Special Service London, Dec. 10. —In connection with the Liverpool bank robbery Crown Prosecutor Gill told an amusing story when Goodie, Burge and Kelly were brought up at the Bow street police court. He said: Qoudie, though a competent bank clerk, was. a most simple young man. In a railway car riage in October, 1900, he first met Kelly and it. man named Styles, who is still wanted. The acquaintance ripened over a friendly game of carJs. Kelly told Goudie be was in a posi tion to get hold of good racing information, and Goudie bet according to the advice he received. The money was sent to Kelly, who shared it with Styles; Instead of carrying out their commission, these two men soon found out all about Goudie, and in twelve mouths the simpleton had paid them $360,000. Burge, j Manc«3 and Marks, on learning how well Kelly and. Styles were doing, thought they would like to follow such a good example. They ?ot an Introduction to Gaudie, and be tween Oct. 24 and Nov. 14 this year he paid them $465,000. NEW CUBAN GOVERNMENT Guv. Wood Will lr»e Its Prompt Establishment. JV<w Turk Sun Special Service Washington, Dec. Governor Gen eral Leonard Wood has gone back to Cuba with the determination to urge upon the Cuban people the importance of prompt action in establishing the independent government. General Wood is an earnest advocate of tariff concessions to Cuba, but he was plainly told by members of the Cuban affairs committee that it would be useless to ask congress to enact any iigis lation of this sort in advance of the es tablishment of the Cuban republic, when a reciprocity treaty might possibly be ne gotiated. NEW GERMAN TARIFF Economic War With Rnsnia Appears Inevitable. Berlin. Dec. 10. —There seems to be no doubt that the discussion of details of the tariff scheme in committee will be pro tracted until next summer and that the bill if passed at all will not leave the reichstag before the following winter. The result of raising the grain duties will be a tariff war with Russia. Germany might attempt to retaliate, but it is doubtful if she could do so successfully. Since the conclusion of the present Russo- German commercial treaty, German ex ports to Russia have more than doubled, showing the seriousness of the interests of Etake.

The suggested length of their tunneling is enormous. It is pro posed that there shall be fourteen tunnels with a total length of 19^2 miles. MISCHIEF MAKER. A Surprlwe in Brooklyn. An adult's food that can save a baby proves itself to be nourishing and easily digested and good for big and little folks. A Brooklyn man says: "When baby was about eleven months old he began to grow thin and pale. This was, at first, at tributed to the heat and the fact that his teeth were coming, but, in reality, the poor little thing was starving, his mother's milk not being sufficient nourishment. One day after he had cried bitterly for an hour, I sugested that my wife try him on Grape-Nuts. She soaked two tea spoonfuls In a saucer with a little sugar and warm milk. This baby ate so raven ously that she fixed a second which he likewise finished. It was not many days before he forgot all about being nursed, and has since lived almost exclusively on Grape-Nuts. To-day the boy is strong and robust, and as cute a mischief-maker rs a thirteen-'months-old babq is expected to be. We have put before him other foods, but he will have none of them, evidently preferring to stick to that which did him so much good in his time of need—his old friend Grape-Nuts. Use this letter any way you wish, for my wife and I can never praise Grape- Nuts enough after the brightness it has brought to our household.. These state ments can be verified by any one who wlsheß to make a visit to our home." T P. McElroy, 256 S Third street, Brook lyn, N. Y. Grape-Nuts is not made for a baby food, but experience with thousands of babies shows It to be among the best, if not entirely the best in use. Being a scientific preparation of Nature's grains, it Is equally effective as a body and brain builder for grown-ups. POLITICS IN HAWAII Little Hope of Conflicting Interests | re Compromising.. Interests 1 Compromising. A DO-NOTHING LEGISLATIVE MEET Gov. Dole Attacked for Borrowing; (or Public rnr|iiiM-»-"Solou»" Didn't Appropriate. Aviv York .Suit Special Service Honolulu, Nov. 26.—The political situa tion of the people of the Hawaiian is lands is peculiar at present, and there is ' little hope of compromise of the conflict ing interests. The tax receipts for the year were not as large as expected, but ] the income law brought in enough to run ' the government for the rest of the present executive term. The home rule or native party is still In the ascendant and there is little hope I of the white republicans gaining control j of the government. The democratic party i is weak. The republican party proper is ; divided into two factions at present, one i supporting the administration and the other bitterly fighting the policy of Gov ernor Dole and his advisers. The oppo- ! nents of the governor, including many re- ! publicans who have the support also of \ two republican newspapers, insist that he j should call a special session of the legis- ! lature to provide a bond issue for the \ payment of the running expenses of the government. Sment of the running expenses of the i ernment. ho legislature, which is controlled by i the home rulers, spent its time at the last j session in discussing a county government i bill and a tax on female dogs and when | the session expired by limitation it was | found that nothing of real value had been i accomplished, which is, in a large meas- I ure, responsible for the present difflcul- i ties of the government. For this reason . Governor Dole has refused to call a spec- j ial session, and such needs as will permit I of no delay have been filled by borrowing ■ ! the necessary funds from prominent busi- ! ness linns, at the personal solicitation of the governor and with the expectation that the next legislature will appropriate j I the money for the repayment of these I loans. This policy has also been bitterly ! I attacked, and now the enemies of the i governor charge that he delays the calling ' i of a special session in the interest of the ! speculators, who hope to profit by the i stringency in the money market. It is hinted that the opposition branch of the republican party is fighting the governor In the hope that it may secure I tho co-operation of the home rule party j and in that way gain control of the legis- ! lative branch of the government. In Hilo, tho largest town of Hawaii, the home I rulers have already adopted the platform ! Ixf the republican national convention of i ■900 and are firmly entrenched in the j [ranks of the latter party, having nomi- I nated a republican candidate for the leg- I islature to fill a vacancy. There is in the territory no county or city form of government, the county bill having been vetoed by the governor on I the ground that the country is not yet ! ripe for such an innovation. It* would, no i doubt, result in the natives gaining con- i trol of every city and county in the is- j lands, end so far the Hawaiians, from ! their actions in the legislature, have not i impressed the Americans with a sense of ' j their fitness for self-government. j

USES OF ALCOHOL An I'nequaled Maude Food When I'sed Moderately. New York, Dec. 10.—Before the biologi cal section of the New York Academy of Sciences at the Chemists' Club, Professor F. S. Lee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, gave the result of his experi ments on tne action of alcohol on muscle. He had found, he said, as had Professor Atwater of Wesleyan university that in certain proportions alcohol was essential- | ly a muscle food, and that with its aid \ greater results can be obtained than un- i der normal conditions. Professor Lee conducted his experiments on frogs' legs, in which the alcohol had been injected before amputation, so that the fluid might j be evenly diffused by the blood. Professor Lee found that when he used | a definite amount of the spirit the legs, ; excited by the electrical stimulation, were able to put forth greater efforts than those not so treated. On the other hand, ; when too great an amount had been em- ' ployed, the effect was exactly the op- ; posite. He said his experiments demon- j strated that, in proper proportions, alco hol was an unequalled muscle food, fur nishing the power as well as the stimula tion to greater efforts.

WASHINGTON Stella Smith of Minneapolis has been ad mitted to practice before the interior de partment. The message of President Roosevelt will be utilized by the republican organizations in many states as a campaign document. Senator Hoar has introduced a bill giving the United States jurisdiction in cases of lynching and making the crime of participa tion in lynchings punishable by death. Secretary Gage has directed the collector at San Francisco not to insist that merchandise consigned to the Philippines shall be shipped in American bottoms. The collector had held "that coastwise laws applied to the Philip pines. The secretary of agriculture has announced the establishment of a new division of soil management in the bureau of soils, with Pro- I fessor F. H. King, formerly professor of soil physics in the University of Wisconsin, in ckarge. So serious are the reports coming from Bue nos Aires and Santiago that the administra tion officials are beginnig to believe that only the most careful diplomacy can avert war between Chile and Argentina. The feeling between the two republics, which has been very bitter, has been accentuated by the at titude of Argentina in respect to the Tactna- Arica dispute. The United States supreme court yesterday, in the case of Wilson 'Brothers .vs. Cassius B. Nelson, a bankruptcy proceeding which originated in Wisconsin, held that Nelson had permitted »ne of his creditors to obtain a preferenoe'through legal proceedings by the entry of a judgment against him and the levy of an execution thereunder upon a stock of goods owned by Nelson, he not having va cated or discharged the lien before the sale of the property under the execution. The court held that Nelson's act constituted an act of bankruptcy. THE
