Congrcis met on Monday; the Southern members were all excluded from seats. Colfax was ro-elccted Speaker, and Mc riiKRSON Clerk. The President's message will probably be delivered to-day, Tuesday. We will issue another paper some day this week as soon as we can after the message comes to baud. It is reported to be highly satisfactory to conservative men. Stanton and the "Beast." It is rumored that Secretary Stanton and "The Beast" are now excellent friends, and have ninny "precious seasons" together. Probably no two men in this or any other country are moro alike, in which statement is included, of course, the Siamese twin?. If it is possible for one to excel the other in meanness, we should say that Butler slight ly excelled tho(ceretary in a grasping, ava ricious disposition. Perhaps this is balan ced by Stanton's capacity for treachery. "The Beast," in helping to build up the Breckinridgo party, that he might betray it, certainly showed remarkable talent in this line, but no more than was displayed by the secretary, while the letter of the latter to MeClellan, assuring him of his prayers and friendship at the time ho was heading a conspiracy to procure his dismissal from command, gave evidence of the possession of an impudence and hypocrisy which prob ably have often excited tho envy and admi ration of "The Beast." We can recall but one capable of doing justice to either, and unfortunately he is dead. Fielding, in his life of Jonathan Wilde, gave proof of pow ers adequate to a correct delineation of a Stanton or a Butler. Indeed they both re Bcmble that "great man" as nearly as they do each other. Tho humorous dramatUt has consequently given us their characters, though connected with the incidents ot an other uian'd life. Mulattoes. A 'person will seldom talk with an aboil tionist any considerable length of tune without being assured of the great number of mulattoes in tho Southern States in com narison with those of the North, lliis, to them, demonstrates the great lack ofehas tity among Southern people, and justifies the tremendous cost at which tho abolition of slavery was purchased. But let us see whether the facts sustain the assertions of abolitionists in this particular. An examination of tho Eighth Census Report, 1800, shows that Massachusetts had 0,031 blacks, and 3,071 mulattoes nearly hulf as many mulattoes as pure blacks. Ohio had of pure blacks l'J.OS and mulattoes 10,021. Pennsylvania had 37,803 blacks, and 19,122 mulattoes. This will servo to show tho relative strength the blacks and mulattoes in the free States Let us now see how they stand in the Soutli ern or eluve States. Alabama hud a si ivc population of -100,750 blacks and 31,330 mulattoes. Gcorma had -135,208 black slaves, and 30,000 mulattoes. South Car olina had 331,220 black, and 21,180 mulat to slaves. While Ohio has nearly as many mulat toes as blacks, among tho slaves of South Corolina thcro is but 1 mulatto to 19 pure blacks. The documentary evidence, then, places the boot on tho other leg, and shows the horrid depravity of tho Northern peo ple in mixing their blood with tho African. It is the Southern people who have cause to complain of those of tho Noith plowing with their heifer. Abolition Philanthropy. Tho accounts of destitution und misery among thu negroes of the South, which daily published, should suggest to abolition ists a more practical philanthropy in their behalf than attempts to confer on them privilege of voting. Thoy have nothing cat and nothing to wear, and a blanket anil a warm meal of victuals would do I hem more good than till tho cditoiials wiitlcn and btump speeches made professedly their iiitcrcstslmvo done since the warelosed. If Jeremiah Cobaith, iiii'iis Henry Wilson and Dr. Cheover, and Mr. Gilbert "from England," and Anna Dickinson, and radicals in congress, will contribute a of pork and bread and shoes, and trowsers for them, they will givo better proof their belief in tho "brotherhood of human ity" than they have yet done.

The logons nf tho late Jamaica insurrec tion are pregnant with arguments against tho very policy wlnoli black Republicanism is seeking to force on the United States, and in which they will succeed if much longer possessed with their present power for mis chief. Jamaica, in 1S3S, reached, through differ- causes, tho same results with which this country Cuds itself possessed at the present moment. The slaves wcro emancipated, and they wcro at once allowed liberal rights. In fact, the frccdincn of Jamaica were placed on a theoretical equality with the whites, the only real impediment to their progress being their naturul incapacity. Negroes filled the army and constituted tho cntiro police forco of tho island. They were afforded a school system, wcro admit ted to practice in tho law courts, they filled the pulpit, and had their representatives among the newspapers. In short, every possible facility was afforded them to acquire properly, and to become equal in every po litical respect with tho white inhabitants. Tho result is so well known that its re capitulation is stale. The island sank at once from first-class productiveness! to fif teenth rate. Left to himself, tho negro sank into idleness and pauperism. He would neither cultivate his own laud nor labor for others. As slaves, the negroes had su diced to make Jamaica the most produc tive country, in proportion to its it area, on the globe; as ficednien, they sank tho pro ductive capacity of tho island to nearly zero, und the white proprietors were forced to import coolies to carry on their plantations. Such was the coiiditiqn of Jamica last spring, rue negroes iuic, improviucnr, inc whites dependent for labor upon Asiatic im migration. It was at tins time that .Ja maica gave birth to some Simmers and Phil- ipscs. ihey assured me negro nut, ms pauperism was not tho result of his own idleness, but of tho exactions of the white Excited by these teachings, the nc groes attempted, by insurrection, massacres and unparalleled atrocities, to obtain an equality which they had failed to secure by pacific competition. Under the teachings of bCMNEit, O.vniu- son, Philips, and an abolition press, this country, if they bo listened to, will follow exactly in the footsteps of Jamaica. Al ready are southern planters driven to Hellenics for the iuipoitution of coolies or of foreign white laborers, for tho reason that the frccduien, as a general thing, cannot be induced to labor. Already arc insurrections feared from negroes, who attribute their ill success in competition with the white race, to tho tyranny of the latter. Everything promises well for a reproduction of Jamaica upon tho soil of the United States, should the radical managers of abolitionUni secure their ends.

Constitutions are of no account when they obsl met the interests of 'loyal' men and as Holmes county is an evc-soie to the abolitionists of the State ami a great wound upon the spirits of its 'loyal' inhabitants. a 'loyal' Legislature must exercise the war-power, and 'out' 'the damned spot belore 1'eace is proclaimed.

To the Democracy of Ohio. ROOMS OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE EXECUTIVE COMMITEE. COLUMBUS, O., Nov. 27, 1865. The publication of tho official return of the vote polled nt the State election, held on, tho loth of October, makes it appropriate that the Stuto Executive Committee- should address their fellow Democrats of Ohio, them upon the result of their; exertions and the substantial success, achieved in the contest. Tho total voto of 193,007 is tho largest ever cast by tho Dem ocracy ut a gubernatorial election, being 8,000 more than wcro polled nf'ter the gal-) lantcauvas's of 1803, and 11,000 more than at the Stato election last year. Tho Demo cratic gain on tho fraudulent majority for tho Republican candidate two years ago is over 70,000; upon the majority of fl0,0oi) at tho Mate election last year a gain ol M,uuu, and a gain of 30,000 on the majoiity given for the Republican candidate for President in 180 I, Besides, we have largely increased our strength in the General Assembly; und in a number of counties in which, for sever- i . - ni years, we navo uccn in a minority, we have elected our county tickets. These facts, indicating as thoy do tho steady and certain decline of Abolition strength, in stead, of being a disaster, constitutes n sub stantial triumph for tho Democracy, which i i . nccu omy ue proncny impioveu to insure the speeuy and , pctuiancnt redemption of 

UI1IO IIOIII ilUUIUIUIl UUIlllllUUUII. The contest thus auspiciously closed was inaugurated by the adoption of a correct, sound and glorious platform, in which Dem ocratic principles were cleat ly and fearless ly declared withoutdisguiso or mutilation a plalform rceoznizod all over the Union as being a faithful and honest exposition ofj Democratic principle, measures and ideas. Upon this noble platform, cordially endors ed by the gallant candidates, the Democracy of Ohio made ii glorious canvass: and al though ucleated, came out ot thu contest with dignity and honor its good name un impaired, its ranks unbroken and undis mayed. Next to the inherent vitality of .Democratic principles, cndcaied tothegrcat mass oi tho people ty the blessings they have conferred, and tho hallowed rccol ec- tions that cluster about them, the credit of tins success is due to the press, upon whom the burden of the campaign was thrown, anu especially upon mc county press, whoso important duty was most nobly and effect ually performed, entitling its conductors the commence and liberal support ol the party. Nor ought the gallant bearing and proper excitioiHOI our candidates, and the imnoriuiit ijiiois oi mu local committees, to bc ovei looked or forgotten. It is the duty and the privilege of the Democracy, upon whose buccess depends, now, more than ever, tho restoration of civil-liberty, popular happiness and nutitTiial prosperity, to preserve their principles un contaminated, their organization intact, ami their eonIidencn tho ultimate success punciples, which are manifestly deeply root ed in the hearts of the people, unshaken. There is in the result of the Ohio election much to encourage continued cllbrt und in flexible adherence to tho Democratic doc trines and organization much to bo expect ed from a fair, open and fearless contents upon tho ancient principles of tho par ty. Instead, then, of relaxing our exer tions, let us rather complete our orgauitioti that we may be in a state of peif'ect preparation for the ensuing contest. The beneficial effect of organization was most for cibly illustrated in tlie recent campaign, and if pcifcctcd in all the counties will do much more in in tho future. In republics it be hooves tho people to guard their liberties With the mot jealous vigilance; und to re guin ours und lestoro the country to its for mer condition of tranquility, freedom and prosperity, it is peculiarly incumbent upon the J)emociacy to adhere to their principles and their organization, as the only means, o enjoin upon all to nliom these principles aro eudcaicd by the recollections of past and by their hopes for the future oureountry, lo stand lirm in tlicirallegiuiice to them, and never renounce faith in their complete and glorious success.

The facts in tho case, as to of i the of thev havo been avouched to us. arc these A draft was made on that township on the 4th of October, 1801, for fifteen men and the customary pcrccntugo to cover any de ficiency by reason of failure to report and incapacity on tho part of drafted men for service Martin Raker's nanio was tho 25th drawn out. On tho 10th of that month lie was notified to report at tho Provost Mar shal' ollice in Newark, which he did not do thinking, reasonably, that some effort should bo made to get those into Ecrvicc who had been drafted before him ; and a short time subsequently the required quoto was more than filled from the persons whose names had bcen urawn out bcloro his 10 having been obtained. No proceedings were instituted against him under that call ; he did not leave the country; attho Presidential election ho voted ; his voto was not chal lenged ; but at tho late election tho Judges of Election refused to aecept his vote, and claimed to find authority for its rejection in their allegation that ho was a deserter. He brought suit against them for refusing his vote, Un thoUJd ol Uetouer, iu.r, huwas irrcsted by the authority of tho Provost Marshal at Newaik, and was sent to Camp Chase, where he yet remains in confinement. On Monday he was put on trial before a Court-Martial, and what the finding of th.it Court-Martial has been we do not know. Governor Anderson was applied to a short time ago to make intercession in hisbchulf, at the Wur Department: but hestuted thut he hud no intlucncc whatever Willi that Depart ment, mid that ho w'ould be more likely to prejudice Raker's case than serve him were he to call the attention of that Depart ment to it. When Gen. Cox was applied to on Monday, before the trial was com menced, we understand that ho said that if Raker wished to get olf easily it would not be well for him to persist in his prosecution of the Judges of Election for icfusing to receive Ins voto at tho late election. On thu lith of October. 1805. tho War Department issued an order interdicting the arrest of any persons who had failed to respond to their draft summons, and order ing tho immediate release of all persons who had been arrested and were held for trial for having in any manner sought to evade the service after having been drafted into it. The question is pertinent, wherefore this singling out of Martin Raker? Why ar rest him one year after ho had been drafted as a reserve to make good anv deficiency thut might result liom the tutliuc to secure or accept any who were (halted to take precedence of him? Wherefore his con iinemcnt at Camp Chase for one month af ter the War Department had Usiied its or ders forbidding such arrests, and compell ing the re ease ol all peisuns who had been arrested and were held to undergo trial for hilling to respond to a dralt summons .' Wherefore did Governor Anderson not take this matter in hand when he was asked to do so, and do something toward asserting the aut iontv ol U no over her own citizens. in a time of peace, ut least? Wherefore did General Cox, tho commander of the Department of Ohio, and the Governor elect, intimate that Martin Raker might get oil easily it ho would withdraw hus suit against the Judges of Election who refused to receive his vote at tlie lute election.' It is scarcely worth while to multiply words about this ufl'.iir ; but it docs occur to usus one ot the most vindictive and pro snrititivo outrages that has occurred since the present party camo into power.
