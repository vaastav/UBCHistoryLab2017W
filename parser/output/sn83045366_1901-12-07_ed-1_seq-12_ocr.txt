TSfiES'AftWft- THE MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL. A VICTORY FOR GLENWOOD High School Debaters From That Town Defeat Their Worthy Opponents From Morris—A League Contest. Special to Tha Journal. Glenwood, Minn., Dec. 7.—Glenwood and Morris are old rivals. They have met often in debate, baseball, football, and only a few weeks ago Morris overwhelmed her opponent on the gridiron. Having shown her superiority in brawn, her de baters came down last night prepared to show her prowess in brains. Nor did her debaters come alone. A special train on the Soo carried nearly 200 loyal support era of the orange and black. One thing is certain—Morris and Glenwood are live lit tle cities, loyal to their own respective interests, and they have learned to a finish the delicate art of rooting. By 8 o'clock the opera-house was packed to the doors. The aisles were filled and even the orchestra seats were crowded out. Bang, zip, boom-er-rah! Boom, zip, bah! Gleuwood high school, Rah! Rah! Rah! This was the battle cry which rang out defiantly from the Glenwood side of the hall and just as defiantly the answer came back from Morris in similar jargon. The table on the stage which was to be used by the Morris team was profusely dec orated with orange and black and the one opposite was similarly festooned in blue and gold. It seemed that everyone in the hall wore one of these combinations. Blue and gold, orange and black, ribbons and banners were everywhere. Between the ebb and flow of the rooting tide, the Glenwood high school orchestra entertained the audience. Fourteen man dolins, guitars and violins were played in good time and made very sweet music. At 8:20 o'clock Senator Charles P. Reev»s, the presiding officer, stepped to the front of the stage, read the proposi tion, announced the first speaker on the affirmative,—Paul Spooner of Morris,— and the debate was on. Any detailed account of the way the question was handled would be out of place since the same proposition is to be debated soon by thirty other high schools of the state. But it was well handled by both sides—surprisingly well for high school students. Both teams showed careful reading and considerable assimilation of the thought. Paul Spooner, the second speaker on the Morris team, had the most forceful de livery of the Morris boys, and Ralph Stone, the third speaker, was able to think on his feet better than any one else in the contest. A bright little girl, Miss Lotta Gray, received an ovation when she rose to make the opening speech for Glen wood. And Glenwood suffered nothing from the work of this courageous little miss. She held her own with the best of the boys and was clear in thought and forceful in delivery. William Padden appeared to be the youngest speaker of the six. He is only a sophomore and this was his first public debate 'but he "kept his head" and> made a good' speech. Probably the (best speaker of the even ing was Viggo Johnson the last of the Glenwood trio. He showed careful read- NOT 

MARRIED, BDT MAY BE SOON A Practical Joke on a Practical Joker That May Have a Happy Ending. It Isn't always necessary to be married In order to enjoy the ridiculous discom forts of a wedding Journey. That fact has been discovered by writers of fiction be fore this; but it was borne in upon a young lady whose home is in the Midway district recently in a way that she will not ■soon forget. The whole affair was a prac tical joke, but in the end, the Jokers found they had builded better than they knew. That, however, is anticipating the story. The young lady in question went down to Chicago, some months ago, to visit relatives. While there she met a num ber of young persons, and as she is some thing of a practical joker, she hadn't been there long before several of them were "just aching for a chance to get even." Finally their opportunity came. A day was set for the visitor's departure; and the crowd went down to the station to see her off. Just outside of the depot she was introduced to a young man, the friend of one of the boys, who also was on his way to Minneapolis and who intended to take the same train. Through the gate they went and into the same car, the Minneapolis girl in the lead. As eh© entered the Pullman she turned, laughingly, and said: "Just look at that section! Evidently we are going to have a bride and groom with, us on the-way up." The section in question was lavishly decorated with white ribbons and bridal roses. As one of the party remarked, it was "certainly a splendid piece of work." The odor from the flowers perfumed the entiTe car, and every one in it was cran ing liis neck to catch sight of the newly made benedict and his bride the moment they should appear. Then came the porter, and with grandi loquent air deposited the luggage and wraps of the Minneapolis girl in the bridal section. "NEARLY A CENTURY OF KIDS" TO PLAY AND SING AT CENTURY HALL NEXT THURSDAY The concert to be given next Thursday evening at Century hall by The Journal Newsboys' Band and the Boys' Choir of Gethsemane Episcopal church, will be one of the most unique entertainments of the season and merits a large audience. There are fifty-five members of the band and thirty-five in the choir so that there will be ninety boys in all to furnish the entertainment—nearly a, century of them. |All the boys are "kids" in the strictest sense, the youngest being about 10 years old and the oldest about 17. But they are kids that have musical ability and whether they play instruments or sing with their fresh, boyish voices, the music they make is pleasing and enter taining. Below Is printed the program in full and it is strictly popular. The Journal band will play Its best marches, two steps, waltzes and overtures under the dlreotion of Professor C. O. Heintzman and the Boys' Choir, under A. I* Wiley, choirmaster, will sing some of their most inspiring choruses. One particularly pleasing selection will be the grand old hymn, "O, Paradise, O. Pardise," while another enjoyable number will be the solo, "The JLadder of Life," by Master Leonard Everlof, a 12-year-old boy who has a beautiful voice. The concert will be given in Century Hall next Thursday night at 8 o'clock. The hall 1b very limited as to seating ca- MornlntTt Afternoon, and Evening. - The Northern Pacific's "Duluth Short Line" Is the only line running three through i i trains each way." j between r, the [ twin oitlM. and th© Jtttad of tit* gr«at lakes. ing, skilful arrangement of material, en tire clearness and a force and dignity of delivery, without any strain, which would be creditable to a much older speaker. The team work of the Morris boys was excellent. Each speech dovetailed smooth ly into the preceding and helped to make a well rounded whole. In delivery they t appeared to >be overtrained rather than undertrained. They had not that strained elocutionary delivery which we have heard and seen so often in the declamatory contests of the past. The gestures seemed cut and dried, and at least two of the speakers pushed their voices beyond their limit. Every public speaker should remember that nothing is gained by mere vociferation. It repels an audience. An audience can be coaxed by ,a simple but earnest dig nity of delivery but it can seldom be cudgeled into belief. Then too, it should be .remembered that while gestures are a help they are not a necessity in a good speech. Unless they spring naturally and Irresistibly out of the thought they are better omitted. But in spite of the strong team work of the affirmative, the negative was able to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the judges which the affirmative did not dispel. The last speaker "summed up" and the judges—Superintendent Chrislopherson of Long Prairie; Superintendent Cran ston of Alexandria, and Professor McDer mott of the university, were asked to withdraw and confer. In a few minutes their decision was handed in to the pre siding officer. "Unanimous for the negative," was the verdict. Glenwood had won. Then pan demonium came and staid for half an hour. The Glenwood people had given the yell before. Now they shrieked and pounded the bass drum. The Morris root ers are not "quitters" for a moment. Al though defeated they still shouted lust ily for their defeated team. The rooting was almost as interesting as the debate itself. To one who likes enthusiasm and likes young people it was a genuine In spiration. It is doubtful if those scores of boys and girls will ever again listen with such eagerness to an exposition of the some what dry sociologic problem of crime and its deterrent punishment. Certainly no college professor of so ciology can arouse such interest. Each side hung breathless on the words of its heroes as that littl group of New Eng landers is said to have hung trembling and spellbound on the words of their champion, Daniel Webster, when he met and defeated that great debater, Robert Young Hayne of South Carolina in the United States senate in 1830. To an older person who had no special sympathy for either side but a kindly interest in both, the scene was both amusing and intensely interesting. It was a hard but successful fight for Glenwood. It was an honorable defeat for Morris. It was helpful to both schools in many ways. Enough surplus energy was dissipated to save teachers from the annoyance of discipline for at least six weeks. —E. E. McDermott. "Why," she stammered. "That isn't right. I don't belong in there." The porter grinned but said nothing. He turned away, and a moment later de posited a gentleman's suit case on the floor, close beside the little satchel that had preceded it. Then the young man who was bound for Minneapolis cut into the conversation. "Here, porter," he called, "what's all this tommy-rot? Is that my berth?" "Yes, sun! It suttenly is, suh. Upper seben. The little lady has the lower"; and with a guffaw that could have been heard for blocks, the blue-coated attend ant made for the farther end of the car. "Sit down, please, and try to look pleasant," called a voice from the crowd; and then began a shower of rice. Every man in the party had rice in each one of his pockets. Every girl had a bag of it concealed beneath her wraps. "Damn!" said the masculine traveler. "Thank you,' 'said the girl. "Please say it again for me." Finally the train started and their tor mentors were compelled to leave. After wards the ribbons were torn down and the roses thrown out of the window. But the troubles of that very much un married couple were not yet at an end. They went in to dinner together, and found that the solicitude of their friends had preceded them. For they were shown to a table decorated as had been the sleep ing car section, with white ribbons and bride's roses. During the night .each time the train stopped, telegrams were received inquir ing anxiously after their welfare; and altogether the trip was one long to be re membered. However, out of that mock marrlago trip may grow the real article, for the Chicago man's business has brought him much to Minneapolis of late; and an an nouncement is expected shortly. pacity and there will be sold Just enough tickets for the number of seats. To in sure securing tickets, it will be necessary to buy tickets in advance at the Journal counter and they will be on sale Mon day at the low price of 25 cents each. If you wish tickets reserved, telephone on either line No. 9, Main, and tickets will be delivered to your office or residence, but it should be borne in mind that it is absolutely necessary to buy your tickets in advance. The concert will be thoroughly enjoy able, and the pleasure of hearing nearly a "century of kids" will be very Interest ing.

Realty in Minneapolis Edmund G. Walton's figures on the valuation of ground fronting on Nicollet avenue attracted much attention and called forth a demand on the part of those interested in First avenue S property for figures on that. Mr. Walton has answered this demand in the following: My article published in last Saturday's Journal, giving a resume of the assessed valuation on Nicollet avenue brought a re quest from several owners on First avenue S for a valuation of the ground on First ave nue from Washington to Sixth street In the columns of The Journal this week. First avenue is not like Nicollet in many things; it Is like Nicollet in one respect, that is, that the most valuable corners are at Fovrth street, the Oneida building being vaiuefl at $7.87 a square foot, the Phoenix at $7.44 a square foot and the Bank of Com merce buildiug at $6.65, rather higher than the MBPMWd valuation of Mr. Warner's corner at Fourth and Nicollet; also higher than the Syndicate block on Nicollet beween Fifth and Sixth streets. The most valuable property on First ave nue S is from Fourth street down to Wash ington avenue. Inside property on First ave nue S from the postofflce corner to Fourth street is valued at $4.72 a square foot, within a few cents of the value on Nicollet beween Sixth and Seventh streets. On the other side of the street, however, property is valued at $4.84 a square foot—rather more valuable than the property on Nicollet. O:i First avenue S from Washington to Third street the average valuation per square foot is $3.25. The ground under the Olson building is valued at $3.60 a square foot and under the Hale building, across the street, at $3.61. The New York Life Insurance com pany, corner of Fifth street and First ave nue S, is valued at only $3.77 a square foot as against $11.45 on Nicollet, showing how very quickly values decrease as one diverges from the center of business. The New England Furniture Company pays taxes on a valuation of $3.38 a square foot. It is well to observe that this property, at Sixth street and First avenue S, although one of the busiest in the city, is worth only half as much as.the property at Fourth street and First avenue S and less than half of the valuu of the corner of Washington and First ave nue S, occupied by the Hofflin drug store, which is assessed at the rate of $7.12 a square foot:, and less than half the value of the old Union National bank corner at Third street and First avenue S, which is va-lued at $6.78 a square foot. The Dime Museum cor ner is assessed at $3.19 a square foot and the old Northwestern National bank corner at $3.5ti a square foot, about the same as the New England. All of this points conclusively to one thing and that is that the real valued centers of property on First avenue are from Washing ton avenue to Fourth street. Building: Notes.

Mason City, lowa, Dec. 7.— The third day of the trial of W. M. Smith, charged with attempted criminal assault on the person of 14-year-old Lena Schmidt, closed this afternoon and It now looks as if the case would go to the jury on Monday night. The story of the crime is a peculiarly conflicting one. W. M. Smith, the defendant is a resident of Chi cago. Engaged in the sale of a school encyclopedia for the Dodd Meade com pany of Chicago, he visited this city last summer and while making a tour of the schools of the county he is accused of at tempting the crime. The defense introduced depositions from leading Chicago clergymen and business men all speaking in glowing terms of Smith's reputation for integrity and mor ality in his own community. Smith is a graduate of Yale, a member of the Chi cago Board of Trade, and has a son at tending a military academy. The de fense also introduced evidence in the line of an alibi showing that at times men tioned in the case of the state, the de fendant was miles from the spot. Tell tale marks on the little girl's clothing and on the floor of an outhouse at the school, however, verify the little girl's tale of an assault by some man. The defense is trying to lay the blame at the door of another man who passed the school some little time before. Smith's wife, a refined and intelligent appearing woman, sits constantly at his side and three of the best criminal lawyers in this section of the country, headed by J. E. E. Markley, are conducting his case. TWO
