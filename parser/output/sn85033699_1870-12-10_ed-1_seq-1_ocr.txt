The Tribune's "Washington correspondent telegraphed last night as follows: It is reported here to-night that the President and Admiral Porter have been reconciled, and that Gen. Sherman has been acting as peace maker. It is argued by Admiral Porter's friends that, as Gen. Sherman was promoted before the rank of General of the Armj was abolished, so Admiral Porter should be allowed to suc ceed to the office made vacant by the c death of Farragut, before action is taken on Gen. login's joint resolution. Much curiosity has been evinced in re gard to the original manuscript of Por ter's letter to Welles. It is now on file in the Navy Department, but it is asserted it has been recently put there.

Gov. Walker, of Virginia, in his annual .messago of yesterday, shows the way in which Grant sends Federal troops over the South, and pays his respects to him as V!ollow : "I fori bound to say that, in view of dl the circumstances, the sudden with drawal of thtso troop while in the midst of the performance of tho delicate duty to vrhica thayhod been aligned of sustain ing the civil authorities in Norfolk county ia removing negro squatters, in accord ance with an order from the President himself, without any notification to, or consultation with me, endangering, as it did, the lives of our-efllccrs and citizens and the peace of the community, was, in iny opinion, an act of official discourtesy, and a manifestation of an indifference to possible consequences, of ths gravest character, without a parallel in ths his tory of the country. If tha original order for the assignment of Federal troops to this duty were right, then its revocation, under the circumstances, was an inexcus- able wrong." Work of tho Court of Ctultnt. From tbe annual statement transmitted to Congress it appears that the Court of Claims during tho year ending Dec. 5, 1870, rendered judgment in 1G4 cases. The aggregate amount claimed by the par- ties bringing these suits against the United States was about $3,1(00,000. The total amount awarded was $931,387 all in favor of the claimants, except in one case where suit was brought against the United States for damages to tho amount of $100,500, resulting from an alleged violation of a contract by the military au thorities in Virginia. The govern mcnt ect up a counterclaim a pon performance of contract and was awarded $1,649. The largest claim was for the amount of $73f,04-t, and interests from March, 1805, for the net proceeds of some 4,000 boxes of to bacco converted and destroyed by the ar mies of the United Slates during the late war. This suit was dlsrnifsed, but, like most of tho others so decided, has leen appealed to the Supreme Court Among the awards is one of $58,000 in favor of tho Rothschild Brothers for the net pro ceeds of 180 hogsheads of tobacco cap tured by the United States military forces in Richmond, and mid by the Treasury under stipulation. The total amount of the judgments against the United States in tue suits brought for the recovery of the proceeds of captured cotton and su gar is, in round numbers, $295,000. Distiller Decision. The Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue has decided, in reply to a letter frcm tho Assessor, of the First district of Illinois, that no objection is seen to the use of water through closed pipes into the refining or purifying tubes, for ths nurnoso of refining spirits while in the process of continued distilla'ion; but the arrangements for introducing it into thn tubes, however, must be so con structed as to preclude the possibility of obstructing the spirits lrom unrtuues, or f thereby introducing any Other material than water into the spirits. With this view the nines should be constructed with a stopcock controlling the flow of me water, the samo to be under the Iocs and key of tho storekeeper, and he bo Instructed at each lime of introducing the water to closely examine the fame and sw that no other materia

New Yoek, Dec. 9. Senor Domingod Rinz jointly accused with Gen. Thos.tj Jordan of violating ths neutrality laws, will surrender himself at the United States Circuit Court before Judge Woodruff for the purpose of furnishing bail to appear at the February term of that court to answer the indictments which have been found against him. It is said the dis closures of evidence in the case, will de velop tho fact that a bitter quarrel exists among the Cuban leaders in this city, and. that several of them are engaged in col lecting money for tbr own use under the pretense of using it for the Cuban cause. It is reported that a number of wealthy Cbban leaders in this .city sold their jewelry in order to provide money te carry on the war against Spain, and that the proceeds fell into the hands of adventur ers who converted it to their own use.

COMMERCIAL National Board ot Trade Second Day. Buffalo, Dec. 9. The National Board of Trade waj called to order at 9:15 this morning by President Fralcy. The President reported that the Execu tive Council had agreed upon St, Louis as the next place of annual meeting. The President reported that the action of the Executive Council on an amend ment to the constitution in relation to the rates of taxation and representation would be postponed until the next annual meet ing. Frco Trade Between Stale. A motion wa3 made to reconsider the action of yesterday in regard to internal trade, and a resolution was passed in structing the Executive Board to continue its efforts for the removal of all restric tions on internal trade and the abroga tion of such local laws as interfere with the general system of free trade. Mr. Shyrock, of St. Louie, offered a preamble and resolution to the effect that as the Legislatures f the several States would soon hold their annual sessions, it wa3 important that they be apprised at once of the action of the National Board in regard to State and municipal taxation levied on non-resident traders, and that the Secretary be Directed to forward to the State Legislatures, and to tho Boards of Trado and Chambers of. Commerce such tax laws, and that they be requested to urge the repeal of said laws at as early a day as possible. Adopted. Tbe action of the executive council re lating to the selection of St. Louis as the nexi place of meeting was endorted by the Board.

The debate arising on this question was ably conducted by argument pro and con, being advanced by delegates from different sections of the country. ? Tbe I'nbllcCands. A long discussion followed on a pro position from the Newark Board of Trade discountenancing tho granting of the public lands to railroads and ether corporations. A substitute was offered in favor of such grants in special cases under strin gent restrictions, but this failed to receive a two-thirds vote on its naal passage, ana was therefore, lost. Tlio Tarif r, etc. Several propositions relating to the tariff were postponed by a vote of 32 to 30. A resolution was adopted looking to the securing of uniformity in appraisal of goods and levying of duties in the several districts of the United States. The subject of subsidies to promote postal service between this country and Europe, was referred to an able commit tee of five who will report to-morrow. An wvitation from the Buffalo Hoard of Trade to the National Beard fc visit Niagara Falls at jno o'clock to-morrow afternoon waB unanimously accepted,and it was agreed that the National Board ad journ m time to carry out tne proposeu tnp.

A correspondent writes from New Orleans on the 2d, that on that lnoininff. in the United States Court, Judge Dwcrcll presiding, United bta'es District Attorney, J ill. Beckwitfl, called up the case of Percy Fuller, ex- Collector of New Orleans, against whom nineteen indictments had been found by the grand jury for fraudulent entries of sugar and coffee during his term of of fice. The civil cases wcie tried last year, re sulting in every case in the verdict of con fiscation against the consignees, August E. Contourie & Co. The wholo amount involved was some million of dollars. Tho cases have sinco been compromised in Washington by the payment of tho duties, but the criminal charges against Lthe officers of customs through whose ac tive connivance tho frauds were perpe trated, remained on the docket. The United States Attorney endeavored to bring these to an issue. The result is seen. Perry Fuller was called twice on his bond and failed to appear. His sureties, Alexander M. McDonald, United States Senator from Arkansas, and E. G. Ross, United States Senator from Kansas, were then called upon to bring the body of Perry Fuller into court. They failed to make answer. District Attorney Beck with moved for an alias capias, stating that the bonds were taken in Washington and seemed te be very imperfect if not worthless. Tho Case of TVaddy Thompson. Waddy Thompson, against whom in dictments of similar character had been found, was then called on his bail and also failed to appear. District Attorney Beckwith stated that the bond of the ac cused had been stolen at Memphis. Tnompson had been several times arrested at Memphis, near which city he has a magcilbent plantation, but ha3 always been released by obliging courts on writs of habeas corpus. How Uncle Sam Compounds ivith Crime. The correspondent after firing one of thirteen cases found against Perry Fuller and associates, to illustrate the heinous nature of the charges, says the prosecu tions of these cases in the Circuit Courts, cost the Govemment $100,000, and af ter confiscation had been decided in every case, a compromise has been effected by the simple payment of the duties which the party wa3 willing to pay from the first. The main argument on trial was that it was officers of the United States Customhouse who were really guilty offenders. They have been releised on straw bail, or at least, upon informa recognhanccs, and thus this much vaunt ed vindication of the integrity of the revenue law3 ends in a costly fizzle. There is a mouse in the mealhouse some where, and United States Senators to gether with a distinguished Congressman from Indiana, could probably give infor mation on the subject. THE HAPPY FAMILY. A Lively Scene In the Radical Sena torial Caucus. Washixgton, Dec 8. It has been stated by a Radical Senator that the President had declared that it seemed to him unfair that one of tho principal com mittees of the Senate, that on foreign re lations, should be so oig$nized as to be against one of the most important ques tions of the administration's foreign policy. An attempt was made in the RepubltDin caucus this morning to rci model it by displacing Mr. Patterson and appointing Mr. Conkling, as a strange counter-irritant to 3Ir. Sumner s well- known opposition to tbe San Dominszo annexation scheme. Although Mr. Conkling voted against it at the last ses sion, it is said that he now supports tne new plau of annexation proposed in the message, and hence the contemplated change. Mr. Sumner flared up at once and very warmly denounced the proceed ing as a censure on the past action of his committee. Mr. Wilson took the same view. The caucus committee said that Mr. Patterson had been given the chairmanship of the District Committee, which was a compensation for the change. Mr. Sumner did not agree to tbat, Mr. Patterson, he said, desired to remain with the Foreign Relations Com mittee, and the change looked like an at tempt to pack the committee in advance in favor of San DomiDgo. The debate at this point bocame very excited, Senators Morton and Chandler stepping forward and warmly defending the change. Mr. Trumbull thought it was a small matter to produce such an excited discussion, and counseled moderation and harmony between Republican beoators themselves and with the administration. Mr. Wilson said that Mr. Patterson felt aggrieved a. the reported change, and desired to re main, for personal ieason, on his .eld committee, and he (Wilton) therefore moved to recommit the subject to the Caucus Committee, with instructions to report the old Foreign Relations Commit tee. Mr. Patterson here jumped up tnd said he did not propose to take a single crumb frcm the administration through the hands of Mr. Chandler. Wilson's motion was carried by two to one, and subsequently the caucus reassembled, re ceived the report, ratified it, and after ward tho whole list of committees was reported in open Senate and adopted.

French mismanagement on the Loire. A correspondent telegraphs from Tours on the 7th inst. that the Government states tLat he army of the Loire is at its old quarters, but the losality is not given. Despair has seized Eome here and the spirits of others have risen to meet the desperate condition of affairs. The Gov ernment declares that the reverses were only of temporary importance. Many railway trains loaded with cattle, sheep and provisions, had been concentrated near Orleans for the succor of Paris. They were all saved. Most of the gun.s taken by the Prussians were mounted navals. The evacuation of Orleans was caused by the demoralization of some new rreufh troonj and the mistaken stratecv and indecision of Gen. D'Aurelles d Pal- ladinca, who allowed two corps to be overwhelmed by the whole Prnssian ar my, although he had 200,000 men within reach. Official returns state that the aimy of the Loire consisted of 300,000 men with 1,000 guns in the engagements of the 3d and 4th. Only 00,000 French fought against 150,000 Germans. The plan of the Campaign was devised by Gambetta, aided by Deuerre, a young officer of the engineers, and was either not carried out by Daurells, or the plan itselj wa3 fatally erroneous.

Wootton, of Hopkinsville, Ky., that bids fair to take the ptflce of all others in maike. It is at tachable to any rear-cntting machine, and is so situated that it prevents nil tendency to side draff, as we wero assured by the in ventor, that tha entire self-raking appara tus will not exceed CO (sixty) pounds in weight, when made strong and very dura ble. It is tho only ruke in the market that delivers tho gavel by a pare side delivery, and it seems to ns surprising that a ma chine so simple and yet effective, had not long since been discovered. Mr. Wootton has properly secured bis invention, and we learn expects to go North at an early day, to make arrangements for its manufacture.
