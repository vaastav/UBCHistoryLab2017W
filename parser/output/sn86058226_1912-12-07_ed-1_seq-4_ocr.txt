By EDWIN A.NYE. WHICH? As you go by train westward from &he city of St. Louis you note a long pne of tall towers leading off to the morthwest. The towers are built to bold the big gables that are to convey electric pow W from the Keokuk dam to the city. The big dam is nearly 200 miles away, and the power will be conveyed long seven copper cables running over $he towers. Sixty thousand horsepower will be transmitted from the power house at Keokuk to turn the wheels of hun dreds of St. Louis factories and pro vide light for the city. St. Louis has contracted for this 60, 000 horsepower, which will leave 140, 000 to be distributed to other cities. And , If the demand exceeds this supply other turbines will be put in sufficient to double the capacity and make it 400.000 horsepower. t There was no especial problem In getting this power to St. Louis. ; Here was the need; there was the power. All that was required was proper connection between the need and the power. However One never ceases to wonder not only at the mysterious phenomena of the hidden power in electricity, but at the possibility of conveying this tremen dous power hundreds of miles by wire. But why wonder? Here is a man of wonderful power. ."Where does he get it? Where is the great dynamo with which he Is con nected? What Is the connection? I The power is not wholly In the man himself. ' Every man who has studied himself well knows there is a power outside of himself, that somewhere in the uni verse is a dynamo with which he is more or less connected. What is that power? He does not know any more than he knows what electricity is. He can name It, but he does not know it. . But- 1 He does know there Is an infinite power house through which power is diffused. , And ' Which is the more wonderful, the distribution through visible connection of a physical power or the invisible connection with an Invisible power?

Lack Color. - There Is no race of human albtnos, end the albino appears in nearly all races. Latin albus means white in KngMgT The word albhao is applied to white plants and white animals. Specifically when we hear the word we think of white humans men or women without color. In a full or complete albino (human) all pigment or color Is absent In the skin, in the in terlor organs and even In the brain White negroes and Indians exist, as well as in Caucasian or "white races, some of these being quite dark. A total albino has a white epi dermis or skin and also white hair ami red eyes, due to the absence of pig ment In the membranes of the eye, which Is for the purpose of screening light that is too bright for the retina that is,' in albinos; others can see thu retina in the rear of the eye, and thin appears to be red. Albinism Is not a disease, nor are th minds of albinos weaker than thosu of others. White blackbirds, mice hares and birds are albinos. And ther. .white elephants are sacred and wor shiped by some races in Asia. Ex Hasenpfeffer for Innch at wmnesr s tonteht Only a Week 's Vacation. Richmond public school children are to have only one week's vaca tion during the Christmas holiday season. The time honored custom of giving two weeks' parole from those exacting masters. Reading. 'Riting and 'Rithmetic, during the happy Yuletide has been rudely violated and there is many a cheerless young heart in Richmond today. The explanation for the shaving down of the Christmas vacation to one brief week Is that the school authorities desire to dismiss school one week earlier in the summer. Can it be some of our teachers desire to spend a week longer in Eu rope next summer? However, be that as it may, a loud juvenile protest has arisen over the school authorities' appropriation of five school days from one of the happiest periods of the year. Really the action of the powers-that-be in our schools does not ap pear to be a wise move. The children have been in school now for three months and after the first of the year they must be in school five and a half months' more. Two weeks of rest and holiday fun, it seems to us, would be beneficial to the youngsters and make them brighter and fresher for the almost half year of toil with their studies which lies ahead of them. Also, it seems to us, the summer vacation is long enough now without adding one more week to it. Will all the children in favor of two weeks' vacation during the Christmas holidays kindly raise their hands. Promotion to Goethals. President Taft has had a happy thought. He has suggested to congress that a certain soldier, Colonel Goe thals of the Engineering Corps, be promoted to the rank of major-general. Undoubtedly congress has been so busy of late playing politics and tapping pork barrels that it has merely overlooked recognizing the ser vices this modest soldier has performed for the benefit and glory of his country, and now that the president has called its attention to this over sight we anticipate congress will pause in its trials of alleged judicial crooks and cease debating over the Squedunk post office appropriation long enough to. bestow upon Col. Goethals a rank which carries with it enough salary that the distinguished builder of the Panama Canal, the greatest engineering feat In the history of the world, can have enough funds to return to the states occasionally. What a disgrace it would be if Col. Goethals was added to the al ready long list of victims of the "ingratitude" of this republic. This officer of the engineering branch of the regular army has per formed a task which was abandoned by some of the most distinguished engineers In the world. After the repeated failure of these experts to ac complish results and "stick on the job" President Roosevelt, disgusted, turned to the army and crisply ordered that efficient service to take over the work of constructing the "Big Ditch." Without blare of trumpeets or the rantings of press agents Col. Goethals went to Panama and with military precision and affectiveness took over the work and the dirt has been flying like a Sahara sand storm ever since, and the canal will be Inished at least a year ahead of the time scheduled. Practically all of the excavation has been completed and the locks which have been constructed are masterpieces; also the Panama Canal Zone is the most healthy strip of territory to be found In the tropics, and Is being fortified like a Gibraltar. Goethals would be the highest salaried engineer in the world if he could be tempted to leave the army. But he is a soldier and the blandish ments of civil life do not appeal to him. He has not even asked for promo tion in the service he has brought so much honor to, but that is no reason why Colonel Goethals should not be made a major-general and placed In command of the army engineering corps. We respectfully submit to Congressman Gray for his careful consider ation the following parapraph culled from President Taft's latest message to congress: "As the completion of the canal grows nearer and as the wonderful executive work of Colonel Goethals becomes more conspicuous in the eyes of the country and of the world It seems to me wise and proper to make provision by law for such reward to him as may be commensurate with the service that he has rendered to his country. I suggest that this reward take the form of an appointment of Colonel Goethans as a major general In the army of the United States and that the law authorizing such ap pointment be accompanied with a provision permitting his designation as chief of engineers upon the retirement of the present incumbent of that office."

When he was about to present himself at the court for the first time he was informed that a wig was essen tial. Franklin's head was so large that no ordinary wig would begin to fit it. However, one was found sufficiently large to pass him through the ante chambers, after which he was permit ted to remove the ridiculous conven tional appendage and place It In his ample pocket.
