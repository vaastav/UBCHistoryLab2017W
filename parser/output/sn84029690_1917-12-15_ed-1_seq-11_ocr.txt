the hays rami pimss 'RESIDENT TELLS WORLD AMERICA'S IS III THE WAR Declares Prussian Autocracy and Oppression Must Be Done Away With. DEMANDS FULL REPARATION No Desire to Interfere With Internal Affairs of Central Nations, but Peace Cannot Be Made With Germany's Present Rulers Declaration of War on Austria-Hungary.- Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil son in his message to congress today declared emphatically for a peace bas d on generosity and justice after Ger man autocracy "shall first be shown the utter futility of its claims to power or leadership in the modern world."" The message follows : "Gentlemen of the Congress Eight months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of immense and grave significance for us. I shall undertake to detail or even to summarize these events. The prac tical particulars of the part we have played In them will be laid before you in the reports of the executive depart ments. I shall discuss only our pres ent outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. "I shall not go back to debate the -causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true Amer ican to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with, a very grave scrutiny our objec tives and the measures by which we mean to attain the:n ; for the purpose of discussion here in this place is ac .. tion, and our action must move straight, towards definite ends. Must Win the War. "Our object is, of course, to win the war ; and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question: When shall we consider the war won? "From one point of view it Is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amer ican people know what the war Is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in It. As a nation we are united in spirit and Intention. I ' pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I. .hear the voices of dis sent rwho does not? I hear the criti cism and the clamour of the noisy. thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling them selves In impotent disloyalty against the calm, Indomitable power of the na tion. I hear men debate peace who Understand neither its nature nor the way in which we obtain it with uplift ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I known that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely r be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. No Peace by Compromise. "But from another point of view I believe that it ,is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of ac tion consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the set tlement of its searching Issues. "We are the spokesmen of the Amer ican people, and they have a right to know whether their purpose Is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister . forces that interrupt peace and render it impossible, and they wish to know how closely our ' thought runs with theirs, and vithat ac tion we propose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise deeply and indig nantly impatient but they will "be equally Impatient with us if we do not make It plain to them what our ob- leetives nre nnrt what vt-o oru nlonninn -NT " -Tor In seeking to make conquest of peace by arms. Menace Must. Be Crushed. . T believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this intolerable thing of which the 7 masters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of com- bined inp-igue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must .. be crushed and. If it is not utterly brought to an end, at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the nations; and, second, when this Thing and its power are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss - peace when the German people have spokesmen whose words we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are ready in the name of their people to accept the comnron judgment of the nations as to what shall hence forth be the bases of law and of cov enant for the life of the world we . shall be willing and glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay It un grudgingly. We know what that price i 

JAPANESE PROFITEERS STUNG Waliingfords of the Orient Lose Their War Fortunes. Japan's narikin are slipping. The Waliingfords of the Orient who stuck their fingers in the golden pie of world trade at the beginning of the war are toppling from their speculating thrones. From a fortune of $25,000, 000 to "a debt of $100,000,000. is the roost striking example of the7 collapse of a war fortune made by Kazo Yam aguftta, an Osaka speculator, who cor- Al wlll be.- It will be full; Impartial jus tice justice done-at every point and to every nation that the final settle ment must affect, our enemies as well as our friends. Final and Convincing Lesson. "You catch with me, the voices of humanity that are In the air. They grow daily more audible, more articu late, more perstftisive. and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the "war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished because the Irresponsible rulers of a single country have them selves done deep and damnable wrong. It Is this thought that has been ex pressed In the formula No annexa tions, no contributions, no punitive in demnities. Just because this crude formula expresses the instinctive judg ment as to right of plain men every where. It has been made diligent use of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray and the people of every country their agents could reach. In order that a premature peace might be brought about before autocracy has been taught its final and convincing lesson, and the people of the world put in control of their own destinies." Right as the Arbiter, "But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a just idea Is no reason why a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under the patronage of Its real friends. Let It be said again that autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claims-to power or leadership In- the modern world. It is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Not until 'this has been done can Right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the nations. But when that has been done as, God willing. It assuredly will be we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this the time to avow our purpose to do It. We shall be free to base peace on generosity and justice, to tire exclusion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the vie tors. To Win War Our Present Task. "Let there be no misunderstanding Our present and immediate task Is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from It until it is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of ma terials. Is being devoted and will con tinue to be devoted to that purpose until it is achieved. Those who de sire to bring peace about before that purpose Is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon jus tice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and people than their own over thegreat empire of Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia which must be relinquished. Must End German Autocracy. "Germany's success by skill, by In dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired, rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and in fluence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish in their stead what the "world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and north ern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans, and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia, from the impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy. To Manage Their Own Affairs. "We owe it. however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to re-arrange the Austro Hungarian empire. ' It is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands, in all matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the 'Balkan peninsula and for the people of -the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe; their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and free from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. "And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the German empire; no Interference with her internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other ab solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con trary to the principles we have pro fessed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a na tion. German People Deceived. "The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their em pire; a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly ' nered the cotton market. Until recent ly the Osaka operator held the em pire's cotton market in his hand. An other Osaka narikin committed suicide when his war bubble burst, with the war boom of Japan past its height. Japan's trade returns for the open ing ten days of October were Y52, 218.000, a decrease of 10 per cent over the previous ten-day period. The im ports totaled Y2S,513,000. a decrease of one-half of 1 per cent over the pre vious ten-day period, but an Increase over the same period of last year. false,, and we must seek by the ut most openness and. candor as to our real aims to convince them of Its false ness. We are in fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one Is threaten ing the existence of or the indepen dence or the peaceful enterprise of th German empire. Not Again to Be Trusted. "The worst that can happen to the German people is this, that if they should still, after the war Is over, continue to be obligated to live under ambitious and intriguing masters In terested to disturb the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, it might be impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world's peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might be Impossible, also, in such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic Intercourse- which must inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that; and such a situation, inevitable be cause of distrust, would In the very nature of things sooner or later cure Itself, by processes which would as suredly set In. Wrongs Must Be Righted. "The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed In this war will have to be righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. "The world will not permit the com mission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. States men must by this time have learned that the opinion of the world Is every where wide awake and fully compre hends the Issues involved. No repre sentative of any self-governed nation will dare disregard It by attempting any such covenants of selfishness and compromise as were entered Into at the congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people wIk enjoy no privilege and have very sim pie and unsophisticated standards of right and wrong, is the air all govern ments must henceforth breathe If they would live. It is in the full disclos ing light of that thought that all poli cies must be conceived and executed in this mid-day hour of the world's life. People Have No Say. "German rulers have been able to up set the peace of the wrld only because the German people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the com radeship of the other peoples of. the world either in thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exer cised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the hearts and consciences of freedom everywhere. Its conclu sions will run with these tides "All these things have been true from the very beginning of this stu pendous war; and I cannot help think ing that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, suspicion and distrust swept away, and a real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed In that belief since, the sad reverses which have re cently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable government of freernen might have been avoided. "The Russian people have been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people In the dark, and the poison has been ad ministered by the very same hand. The only possible antidote Is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often. Freedom of the Seas. "From every point of view, there fore. It has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to ndd these specific Interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the senate In January. Our entrance into the war has not altered our attitude towards the settlement that must come when it Is over. When I saidjn Janu ary that the nations of the world were entitled not only to free pathways up on the sea but also to assured and un molested access to those pathways I was thinking, and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and support, but also of the great and pow erful nations, and of our present ene mies as well as our present associates in the war. I was thinking, and am thinking now, of Austria herself, among the rest, as well as of Serbia and of Holand. Justice and equality of rights can be had only at a great price. We are seeking permanent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world and must seek this can didly and fearlessly. As always, the right will prove to be expedient. Declare War on Austria. "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and just to. its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all Impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. "One very, embarrassing obstacle that stands In our way Is that we are at war with Germany but not with her allies, L therefore, very earnestly rec- ! ommend that the congress immediately j declare the United States in a state of I 

GIRL RAISES CORN She Gets 1,500 Bushels From a Tract of Fifty Acres. Kansas women can till the soil the same as those of France, If necessity re quires. This Is proved in the case of Miss Lucy McGinty of Belpre. who has raised fifty acres of corn that will make thirty bushels t to the acre, and has sown 120 acres of wheat for 1913. Mrs. Mary A. McGinty Is a widow with four children. Miss Lucy is twen ty, there Is one cider sister, a younger war with " Austria-Hungary I Does it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It Is not. It Is In fact he inevitable logic of what I have said. Austria-Hungary Is for the time being not her own mis tress, but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The government of Austria Hungary is not acting upon its own Initiative or in response to the wishes and feelings of its own peopIes.but as the instrument of another nation. We must meet its force with our own and regard the central powers as but one. The war can be successfully conducted in no other way. As to Turkey and Bulgaria. "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey, and Bulgaria. They also are the tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand In the direct path of our necessary action. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but it seems to me that we should go only where immediate and practical considerations land us and not heed any others. "The financial and military meas ures which must be adopted will sug gest themselves as the war and its un dertakings develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the war and for the release of our whole force and energy. "It will be necessary to extend In certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I be lieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons Into and from the United States. "Legislation should be enacted de fining as a criminal offense every willful violation of the presidential proclama tions relating to alien enemies promul gated under section 4067 of the Re vised Statutes and providing appropri ate punishments; and women as well as men, should be included under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien enemies. It is likely that as time goes on many alien enemies will be willing to be fed and housed at the expense Of the government in the detention camps, and It would be the purpose of legislation I have su gested to confine offenders among them In penitentiaries- and other sim liar Institutions where they could be made to work as other criminals do. Go Further in Fixing Prices. "Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further In authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand. I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the Jaw of unrestrain ed selfishness. While we have elim inated profiteering In several branches of Industry, It still runs Impudently rampant in others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of justice, that while the regulation of food prices restricts their Incomes, no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchase, and similar Iniquities obtain on all sides. Tt Is Imperatively necessary that the consideration of the full use of the water power of the country and also the consideration of the systematic and yet economical development of such of the natural resources of the country as are still under the control of the federal government should be Immediately resumed and affirmatively and constructively dealt with at the earliest possible moment. The press ing need of such legislation is dally be coming more obvious. A Word to the Lawmakers. "The legislation proposed at the last session with regard to regulated com binations among our exporters, in or der to provide for our foreign trade a .more effective organization and meth od of co-operation, ought by all means to be completed at this session. "And I beg that the members of the house of representatives will permit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any but a very wasteful and extravagant fashion with the enormous appropriations of the public moneys which must continue to be made. If the war is to be properly sustained, unless the house will con sent to return to its former practice of initiating and preparing all appro priation bills through a single commit tee, in order that responsibility may be centered, expenditures standardized and made uniform and waste and du plication as much as possible avoided. "Additional legislation may also be come necessary before the present con gress again adjourns in order to effect the most efficient co-ordination and op eration of the railway and other trans portation systems of the country; but to that I shall, if circumstances should demand, call the attention of the con gress upon another occasion. Concentrate on Winning War. "If I have overlooked anything that ought to be done for the more effective conduct of the war. your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about is that in the present session of the congress our whole attention and energy should be concentrated on the vigorous, rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the war. "We can do this with all the greater zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this as a wr.r of high prin ciple, debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation; because we know, and all the world knows, that we have been forced Into It to save the very Institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. The pur poses of the -central powers strike straight at the very heart of every thing we believe In; their methods of ' warfare outrage every principle of hu- ' sister and a young brother. The big crops of the farm were managed by Miss McGinty, who had only the as sistance of her brother and sisters and a nephew, who helped on the listing, and an uncle, who adjusted her ma chinery at odd times. To raise the big corn crop Miss Mc Ginty had to work night and day. Dur ing the summer months flies were so bad she could not work during the day time, so she worked night3, had her sisters bring her midnight meals and got her crops cultivated, She plowed inanity and ct knightly "honor; their intrigue - has corrupted the .very thought and spirit of many of our people; their sinister and secret diplo macy has sought to take our very ter ritory away from us and disrupt the union of the states. Our safety would be at an end, our honor forever sullied and brought Into contempt were we to permit their triumph. They are strik ing at the very existence of democracy and liberty. Cause Is Just and Holy. "It Is because it Is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose. In which all the free peoples of the world are banded together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nation, and of all that it has held dear of principle and of pnrpose. that we felt ourselves doubly constrained to purpose for Its outcome only that which is righteous and of Irreproach able intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The cause being just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive and quality.' For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause will we battle until the last gun Is fired. "I have spoken plainly, because this seems to me the time when It Is most necessary to speak plainly. In order that all the world may know that even In the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought Is of carrying the war through to its end we have not forgotten any Ideal or principle for which the name of Amer ica has been held in honor among the nations and for which it has been our glory to contend in the great genera tions that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the people have been opened, and they see. The hand of God Is laid upon the nations. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe, only If they rise to the clear heights of his own justice and mercy. 

PARSIMONY IS NOT ECONOMY Many People Abie to Buy What They Want Use Situation as Excuse for Going Without. It is a curious and mortifying con dition of the prevailing "economy" that many people abundantly able to buy what they want use the situation as an excuse for going without. What does this profit them? It merely makes them richer at a time when the talk Is of being poorer, says the Hartford Courant. Food Is one thing and clothes and other articles that shoppers buy are In a distinctly other class. When Smith cut down the sugar, there Is more sugar for Jones, and the supply of sugar Is limited. But when Mrs. Smith goes without a cloak for which she can easily pay and which she expected to buy this season, she is not helping Mrs. Jones to get it; she Is simply misering along In her own way, and to her small ability driv ing poor people out of work and dis couraging .merchants whose capital Is Invested. This isn't economy, It is par simony. If everybody should quit making purchases, what would become of manufacturers or dealers and of the larger number of workers? It Is a good time to keep a level head. Many who watch the tendency of business say frankly that people of limited means are less saving than those who can well afford to get what they want. The Mystery Explained. Clifton Hess, an employee of the Pennsylvania railroad at Shelbyville, Ind., relates the Indianapolis News, looked out the window of the freight depot the other day and noticed a woman. A half hour later he looked again and still saw the woman. She had changed her position only slightly, moving down the railroad track a few feet. She seemed to be strolling leis urely along, covering about a foot a minute. Curious to determine the reason for her actions, Hess walked outside to get a better view. Then it was all explained. The woman had a big Rhode Island Red rooster with a string tied to his leg. There had evidently been a leaky car of wheat along the railroad, and the rooster, ob livious to all else, was calmly filling his craw while the woman kept up with the procession. Later on during the day the good news must have spread, for there ap peared on the scene several other chickens with owners attached to them by strings. As the ground be came clean the procession slowly moved from view. Cantonment. It Is said that the reason why sev eral high officials of the United Statea government continue to pronounce It "cantone-ment is because they got started that way and are now unable to stop. The president, however, says "can-t'n-m'nt, with the accent on the first syllable. It is worthy of men tion that Professor Hunt of Princeton puts It "con-ton n-ment," with the ac cent on the second syllable, thus dis agreeing with a former head of that Institution, and that while the presi dent has the latest revisions of the Century. Webster's, Worcester's, and the Standard dictionaries on Ms side. Doctor Hunt Is backed by Sir James A. M. .Murray's new English and Stor- month's dictionaries. It is estimated that 50 per cent of the United States army and government officials Insist on "can-ton e-m en t.

ROAD BUILDING LARGE TASK President of National Highways Asso ciation Tells How a Great Sys tem Can Be Built. Thanks to the pushful, pervasive motor car, American road building has "got a move on at last. There Is ev erywhere the cry for roads. The draw back has been that, as yet, there has been no co-ordination of these multi tudinous enterprises. The president of the National Highways association. Charles Henry Davis, In a recent paper stated that we spent last year $249, 955,967, or more than two-thirds the total of money expended so far on the construction of the Panama canal for road Improvements throughout the country. Mr. Davis contention Is that good roads, roads that run for thou sands of miles through state after state, are, properly, not the responsi bility of the state, but of the nation. He would have the federal government build a system of national roads join ing the West with the East, the North and the South, connecting every part of the country, as Is the case with the national highways of Europe, and. as history shows, such as was the essen tial equipment of every first-class power of the past, according to the Boston Evening Transcript. How would such an enormous con struction be paid for and kept np? "Suppose, asks this eminent engi neer, "the government built 100,000 miles of properly planned roads, and at the same time purchased, say, 300 Good Road Needed. feet of land on either side? This land would so continually Increase In value and in demand for leasing on long rental, that the cost of the road and the land purchase would soon be paid. A rental rate of $CC0 per acre would pay the interest on the cost of con struction. But such would rent at vast ly higher rates In cities and towns, high enough to give the nation an In come equal to its total annual expendi tures, from these national highways alone !" 

GOOD HIGHWAYS IN ONTARIO Approximately 55,000 Miles of Road In Province 43,000 Miles In Fairly Good Condition. The province of Ontario has ap proximately 55.000 miles of road. More than 43.000 milos have, been treated and are in fairly good condi tion. About 20,000 miles are well graded earth roads; about 3,000 miles are surfaced with broken stone and about 19,000 are surfaced with graveL In the city of Toronto there is one motorcar to every twenty-five Inhab itants. INCREASED VALUE OF FARMS Influence of Road Improvement on Ru ral Property Is Described by Bal timore' Financier. The Influence of road Improvements on the value of rural property was de scribed In a letter recently sent to the Manufacturers' Record by the president of the Baltimore Commercial bank, who wrote : "Around my home town in Virginia property could be bought three j ears ago for ?G0 to $S0 an acre. We put a fine road several miles through that county, and today you cannot buy anything for less than $100, and some Is held at $150 per acre. Net-Work of Good Roads. This whole country will some of these days be a net-work of good roads, which will have a place on the maps along with the railroads. The Lincoln highway linking the East and .the West, the Jefferson highway, link ing the lakes and the gulf, and the Dixie Overland highway, are a begin ning. Georgia's Good Roads. Between the years 1909 and 1914, Georgia surfaced G.3G4 miles of state roads. Illuminated Road Signs. For 'illuminated road signs an acetylene generator has been Invent ed in Europe that requires attention only once a month. Dark Nest Is Favored. The nest In complete darkness has advantages.
