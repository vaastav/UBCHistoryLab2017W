It Is said that the nienmirn represents the nrimlnlMtrs I lot) 's views of the Hiihjeet. The. pro visions of the hill were explained hy Its author ns follows: The iiiefisiire In designed ,r subject, the future Issues of stocks nnd honds by thn nillrond companies, telephono nnd telegraph companion, engaged In InterMnto commerce, to the scrutiny of the government, of the I'lilted States. Tt Is drawn on the theory that these corpora t ions should lie so organized I that there should be some just and reoson.'ihle relation between their as sets nnd their liabilities. It Is intend ed to prevent for the future over capitalization, stock watering, bond nianlptilntln.se nnd all similar abuses, which In times past have brought more or less disrepute upon the management of railway properties. The. effect of It will be give stnblllty to the existing volume of railway securities and at the snm time to so guard fiiiiire issues as to give normnl values to stocks and bonds, "The bill Is nppllenblo to all corpora, tlons which are subject to existing lawn for the regulation of Interstate com merce, nnd If In addition to telephone and telegraph companies engaged in In terstate commerce. "It Is undertaken In the hill to make ii standard of legality by which th vslllfty of stock nnd bond Issues may be adjudged. These features of the bill nave been drawn without any In tention t hinder or embarrass legiti mate enterprise, either of railroad building or railroad consolidation." After dellnlng the standard of le gality tin) bill requires corporations subject to It, when a new Issue of se ruritles Is proposed, to 'make a full re Issue of se- port of their proceedings In respect to them to the Interstate commerce com mission, showing the amount and char acter of the seeiiiltles It proposes to Issue, and the purpose In which tli proceeds are to he Implied. The bill then provides that the Interstate com merce commission, after a full hear ing, shall determine, whtoher the pro posed Issues are In conformity to the act. In case properties are sought to he milted foil authority is given to the commission to make a. valuation of the property In order that the combina tion may not operate to unreasonably Increase the obligations outstanding. Ii Is provided finally that securities Issued without compliance with the pro. visions of the bill shall be considered frauMiilent, and void, and thai they hah subject the parties responsible for the unlawful issue to the penalties of the law.
