ALEXANDRIA, VA. FKI-'lAY. DECEMBER'/, 1S72. Iu the Senate, yesterday, Mr. Morrill deliver ed an address in favorlof the bill]for the support of agricultural colleges, but its further consid eration was postponed for a week. The Secretary of War was requested t* furnish the Seuate with a list of retired army officers. The Senate refused to take up Mr. Rice's res olution calling on the President far iu for in a tion in relation to the <e?dingof Federal troops into Arkansas. In the House of'Representatives, a memorial of certain citizens of Baltimore. a-king indemni ty fur depredations committed by the public and private armed vessels of France during the years 1793 and ISOl. was referred to the com mittee on foreign affairs. The biii providing for the construction of ten vessels "f war >v:i> discussed and after the adoption uf in amend mAnt reducing the number to >ix. three to be built in public yards and three in private yard.-, was passed. The French National Assembly yesteru-.v afternoon elected :he members of the Commit tee of Thirty proposed byMioisterPufaure. The eomiiiittee, as formed con si.-is of nineteen deputies from the Right, representing y> 1 votes, and eleven deputies from the Left, re presenting 333 votes. What course the Gov ernment will take under the eireum.-tauee seems to be unknown. A special correspondent of the New York World says that the vote on the formation of the committee excited the iiviiest apprehensions in Pari.-, where Sghtiuir was expected. 'Great excitement, he say-, prevailed at Chiselhurst: that Marshal MeM.v hon controls the army, but will act only in obe dience to the Assembly, not Thiers. He add that German reoceupation is certain if nchting occurs. Correspondence has recently ] assed between Bismarek and Napoieon. G< rci&n reoccupation will result in the re-?"-tab:i>hn-en: of the Empire. * The Washington correspondent ot the Balti more Sun says that "Senator Rice does no: hesitate to announce his position. He says that he new sees no middle-ground, and will hereafter act unreservedly with the democratic party. I: is thought that wiil h!so be the posi tion of Mr. Tipton. Of Messrs. Sumner and Sehurz, although they wiil doubtless continue their opposition to ail measures of the majority which do not meet their approval, it caunot be expected, in the nature of things, that they will consent to be classed as members of the demo cratic party. The same may be said of Messrs. Trumbull ani Fenton. but as to Mr. Hamilton, of Texas, it is believed that he will V? by tfco side of Mr. Rice." The enforcement of the act of the Legislative Assembly establishing social equality in ics taurants. ice cream saloons, barber shops, bath ing saloon?, Occ., in the District of Columbia, has been attended with more legal difficulties than were at first anticipated. Judgment in all the cases of information under the act has been rendered in the Police Court, but in all such cases appeals have been entered and the informations will have to pass at first the re view of the Criminal Courr. and thon of other courts of aj peal. In relation to the habits of the late Mr. Greeley, as an editor, one who kn?.w him weil. says:?"In his little room just above the count ing-room of the Tribute, he sat all day and pre pared his cor>y for the printer. He gen erally very patient, but seldom cordial. He listened to the business on hand, and then made his response, and wi:h:-u: ado turned straight to hi- de-k, oblivion* of the intruder. and con tinued his work. To a majority of the Tribune people he was a perfect stranger,rar-!y appear ing in the editorial department." A disj ateh from Washington, to the Peters burg Index says"The friends of the James River and Kanawha Canal are actively engaged in pushing their pr-ject, and considering the best methods of proceeding in Congress. The present idea is to follow out the plan suggested in the President's message and to urge the passage of a bill providing for a commission of experts to examine and report on the best route for a water line communication between the Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic Seaboard." The Boston Advertiser (administration) dep recates the "on to St. Domingo" policy which some of its contemporaries advocate. It takes the Philadelphia North American to ta-k "for desiring not only the acquisition of St. Do mingo, but also that of Cuba, the Danish West Indies, the Navigator's Islands in the Pacific, British Columbia, some islands near Terra del Fuego and a slice from Mexico." This is cer tainly going far to sweep the platter. Just as some of the newspapers gut fully under way in discussing the question as to how the electoral vote in the States, giving majori ties for Greeley, should be cast, the vote icu cast. S i the argument hal to be suspend ed. ' Mr. Dana, of the New York San. give? a detailed account of the illness and death of the lute Mr. Horace Greeley, which is painful to read. When the mind of the deceased gave way, it was enough to say so?and no more. What happened afterwards, in the incoherent remarks indaeed by a fevered brain and un strung nerves, it was unnecessary to bruit to the world. We presume that Mr. Greeley's removal to Pleasantville. where he was placed under the best medical treatment, was the be.-t thing his friends and family cuuli do, under the circumstances ot the case. Such an asy lum promised the most for the rest ora1 ion of his health and his recovery. Tin' gentlemen composing the Board of I n derwriters of Baltimore h:ive called a special meeting for t i-day. at the rooms of the l> >:ir?i of Trade. The object of t he meeting is to ar rive. if possible. at :t ceueral understanding among insurance offices in regard to the rate which shall be charged in future on merchan di.-e and other commodities, and on occupa tion* and buildings involving m-ue than ordi nary hazard. At the request of the vitual department of the Frcneh navy for some wholesome substitute for butter thru would keep weil, Mege Mouriez. after a ion/f course of experiments, has succeed ed in producinc a good substitute for genuine butter, that does not become rancid with time, and is otherwise highly recommended.
