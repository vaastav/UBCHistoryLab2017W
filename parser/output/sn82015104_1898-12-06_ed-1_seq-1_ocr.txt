VOLUME 96.-ISO. 107. CONGRESS HAS REASSEMBLED. Incidents at the Opening of the Short Session, The Galleries in Both Houses Crowded With Spectators. An Unusually Brilliant Scene Pre sented on the Senate Floor—The Sea of Desks in the House a Veritable Flower Garden—Yes terday's Session Devoted to the Reading of the President's Mes t sage. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Congress reassembled to-day under circumstan ces of considerable public interest. The vame Congress, six months ago, de clared war against Spain, and now, with the war fought and won, it came together again for the first legislative consideration of the questions devel oped by the eventful months just pass ed. The spirit of the occasion was not, however, one of immediate expectancy, for the few months left to the exist ence of the Fifty-fifth Congress gave promise of little more than a begin ning of the momentous policies and problems growing out of the war. As usual, all Washington turned its attention to the Capitol for that gala event which marks the opening <ft a session. The weather imposed no bar riers, for the hurricane of yesterday had given way to clearing skies and balmy air. Long before the noon hour, when the Senate and House began their work, the corridors were filled with surging crowds in the rotunda and statuary hall, all pushing toward the galleries. No evidences remained of the explosion and fire which recently ravaged the building. By 11 o'clock the leaders began to make their appearance and the public galleries filled up rapidly. SENATE PROCEEDINGS. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—ln the open ing hours of the last session of the memorable Fifty-fifth Congress, the Senate chamber presented an animated scene. The galleries were filled early, many of the spectators being visitors to Washington, who had embraced the opportunity to witness a Congressional opening. On the Senate floor the scene presented was unusually briliant. The desks of the members were loaded with magnificent specimens of the florist's % art. Nothing more beautiful nor elabo rate in floral displays has been seen there for many years. It was almost a chrysanthemum show, witn roses "and flowers of every description mingled with the chrysanthemums, and all formed into elaborate designs. Morgan of Alabama was the first Senator to enter the Senate chamber, and closely following him came the oc togenarian, Morrill of Vermont. One by one the members dropped into the chamber, and the floor soon presented a scene as animated as that afforded by the galleries. Above the diplomatic gallery, just before the Senate convened, appeared Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Em bassador, and party, with Mr. Wu Ting Fang, the Chines*- Minister, and the at taches of his Legation and some other members of the diplomatic corps. On the floor appeared Lord Herschell, the chief representative of Great Britain on the Joint High Commission, accompa nied by Jefferson Coolidge of Massa chusetts. Sir Wilfred Laurier, Sir Richard Cartwright, Sir Louis Davies and Mr. Charlton, members of the commission, were also on the floor. Promptly on the stroke of 12 o'clock Vice President Hobart entered and. as cending to his desk, rapped for order. Mr. Milburn. the venerable blind Chaplain. In a profoundly impressive manner, returned devout and reverent thanks for "God's goodness to our na tion and for His care of us since last gathered in the chamber." "By Thy good providence," the Chap lain prayed, "triumph has crowned our arms by land and by sea and so that peace has come to us through the coun cil chamber. Let Thy grace be the por tion of our people and may their hearts be rendered in service to Thee and to all men. We pray that Thy blessing may be with the Queen Regent of Spain s *nd her young son, and op her nation. May Thy heavenly grace come to secure and uplift and uphold that stricken people. Grant that all good may be given to us, our motherland, and to all nations, and may we walk hand in hand with our brethren across the sea to the bights of Christian civilization." A call of the Senate developed the presence of sixty-seven members. The usual resolutions were offered and adopted. Cullom of Illinois offered one to appoint a committee to inform the House that the Senate was ready to transact business: Hale of Maine, that fixing the hour of daily meetings at 12 o'clock noon, and Morrill of Vermont that to appoint a committee to notify the President that the Senate was awaiting any communication he might desire to make. Mr. Morrill of Vermont and Mr. Cock rell of Missouri were named by the Vice President to join a like commit tee of the House of Representatives to call on the President. Mr. Mcßride of Oregon presented the credentials of his newly-elected col league. Mr. Simon, to whom the Vice President administered the oath of of fice. Pending the receipt of the President's message the Senate, on motion of Mr. Allison of lowa, took a recess of thirty minutes. At 1:25 p. m. the committee appoint ed to wait upon the President reported the performance of its duties and an nounced that the President would im mediately communicate with the Sen ate in writing. Scarcely had the re , port been read when Major Pruden, the executive clerk of the President, en tered the chamber and presented the message. Vice President Hobart laid it before the Senate at once and its reading was begun at 1:28 p. m. The reading of the message occupied THE 

RECORD-UNION. two hours and eighteen minutes. Many persons remained in the galleries throughout the reading, but, as is usual, little attention wa" Tiven to the presentation of the message, either in the galleries or on the floor, after the end of two pages. Many Senators, who had been provided with printed copies of the message, retired either to the cloak rooms or to the committee rooms to read the document at leisure. Not the slightest demonstration occurred during the reading of the message. When the clerk had concluded the reading, Mason of Illinois presented a telegram from Pritchard of North Car olina announcing that illness prevented his attendance at the opening session. At 3:45, on motion of Piatt of Con necticut the Senate adjourned. IN THE HOUSE. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Exactly at noon Speaker Reed's gavel came down with a sharp crack, the great ebony mace entwined with silver and sur mounted with a silver eagle was lifted into place on its marble pedestal, the spreading folds of American flags were broken to the breeze about the brilliant stained-glass ceiling and the House of Representatives entered upon the clos ing session of the memorable War Con gress. The scene within the great hall was animated, brilliant and pictur esque. The sea of desks within the brass rails which cut off the lobbies, spread ing in semi-circular lines from the Speaker's rostrum like waves from a center, was a veritable flower garden. A majority of the members were in their places, while the encircling gal leries were banked to the doors with people. The assembling of a session of Congress is always a great magnet for the multitude, but to-day the attraction was fraught with the added interest of all the memories which clung about the War Congress, the triumphs and reverses of the recent political battle at the polls and the eagerness to hear the President's message with its re view of the events which have crowd ed the stage during this memorable year and its recommendations of pol icies for the future. The public seemed to feel that this was to be an epoch making session, and for hours before noon a steady stream of people de bouched from the corridors into the galleries. Even the private galleries were crowded an hour before the hour for convening, and they contained many people distinguished in social and high official life. The dainty creations of the milliners' art and brilliantly su perb gowns gave color to the picture. The members began arriving shortly before 11 o'clock, and the hall began to buzz as they exchanged greetings, congratulations or condolences. For those who had gone down at the No vember elections there were expressions of sympathy; for those who had been victorious words of congratulation. Some of the members had regular le vees as they appeared. This was mark edly true of W. A. Stone of Pennsyl vania, Sayers of Texas and McMillan of Tennessee, each of whom wast chosen Governor of his respective State at the recent election. Here and there throughout the throng was an officer in full uniform, an unwonted figure on the floor and a vivid reminder of the war. The floral tributes which the scurry ing pages bore Into the hall and desks of those for whom they were destined, were much more numerous than usual. Some of them were of gigantic size, completely concealing the recipients. There were huge baskets of roses, an chors, horseshoes and floral pieces of many designs. At 11:4.* i the floor was cleaved of all those not entitled to the privilege. The leaders, as a rule, were late in arriving, but as they appeared they were sur rounded and cordially greeted. Hitt of Illinois, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs; Dalzell of Pennsyl vania, one of the members of the Com mittee on Rules, and Henderson of lowa, of the same committee, were each given an ovation. Dingley, the floor leader of the major ity, and Bailey, the minority leader, came in simultaneously from the lob bies of their respective sides. Bailey went immediately to his seat and Ding ley, as soon as he could disengage him self from the friends who crowded about him, crossed over to the Democratic side and shook hands with his political adversary. As the hands of the clock pointed to noon, the giant form of the Speaker pushed through the green baize doors of the lobby in the the hall and Reed' ascended the rostrum. A wave of applause swept floor and galleries upon his appearance. A slight smile played over his benign features as he raised his gavel aloft. When it fell with a resounding whack a hush fell on the vast assemblage. The blind chaplain stood in his place. A moment the Speaker waited, with ev ery eye riveted upon him. Every mem ber rose to his feet and many in the galleries. "The Chaplain will offer prayer," an nounced the Speaker in low tones. Heads were bowed reverently as the Chaplain, in eloquent words, invoked the divine blessing, giving praise for the victory that had attended' our arms and the peace which had come, and asking for strength and wisdom to face the new problems which confronted the nation. At the conclusion of the Chaplain's prayer, the Speaker announced that the first business in order would be a call of the roll to determine the presence of a quorum. While the responses were being made General Wheeler of Ala bama came in and' took his seat in the room immediately in front of the Speaker's rostrum. He was instantly surrounded by half a hundred members and received the ovation of the day. The roll call developed the presence of 207 members, 179 being a quorum. Three new members were sworn in. Grosvenor of Ohio presented Charles Dick, elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Northway Allen of Mis sissippi, Thomas Spight, elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Sullivan, who was elected to the Sen ate, and Grow of Pennsylvania, William H. Graham, elected to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Stone, elected Governor of Pennsylvania. With uplifted hands they took the oath. Dingley. the floor leader, offered the customary resolution for the appoint ment of a committee of three to join a similar committee of the Sena'e to wait upon the President and inform him that the House was ready to receive any communication he had to make. It was unanimously adopted, and the Speaker appointed Dingley. Cannon and Bailey. A resolution was adopted instructing the Clerk of the Senate that the House was ready to proceed to business. The House then took a recess until 1:30 to {Continued on Fifth Page.) 

SACRAMENTO, TUESDAY MOKSIXG, DECEMBER 6, 1898.-TWELVE PAGES. HOW THE MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED. Many Senators of Both Parties Averse to Expressing Opinions Until They Have Been Abie to Give Careful Attention to Its Details. Favorably Commended by Most of Those Willing to Talk on the Subject—Referred to by General Wheeler as One of the Noted State Papers—London Newspa per Comment. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Many Sen ators excused themselves from ex pression of opinions at length upon the message, on the ground that they had not been able to give careful atten tion to all the details. Republican Senators were, however, willing to ex press themselves in a few general words of commendation. Senator Cullom regarded it as "a painstaking, entertaining and accurate historical review." Senator Piatt of New York com mended the expression of a determina tion to increase the standing army and to maintain order in Cuba until the Cubans can take care of them selves. Senrtor Wolcott said it was an ad mirable document. Senator Lodge said it was "able and excellent." Senator Foraker —A good presenta tion of facts generally, but a little in definite on the question of Cuban in dependence. Senator Proctor—A good American paper. Senator Perkins —An able resume of the situation and facts leading up to the war. The Democrats were even more ad verse than he Republicans to dis cussing the ; aper. Senator Jones of Arkansas was an exception. He found in the message a number of points which did not accord with his view's. One of these is the proposition to con tinue the volunteer army in existence until the standing army can be in creased. "Some of us do not favor the mci ease of the standing army," he said, "and the President has no right to assume that a majority stand with him on that proposition." Senator Teller said there would be disappointment over the failure of the President to outline a government for the Philippines. On the recommenda tion in regard to currency, Senator Teller said: "The friends of bimet allism, either national or international, will find no encouragement from any thing that the President says in his message." Following are some of the opinions expressed by members of Congress up lon the message: RepresentaSve Hitt, Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said: "The President has summarized and solved in an able and felicitous manner many of the questions in men's minds everywhere, touching the im mense and rapidly succeeding events and the situation in which the nation finds itself. His simple proposition to let the new possessions alone, under just and firm Governors and by the military arm which conquered them, gives us time for plenty of discussion of all the propositions for their per manent government." Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio —The message is not one of beaten paths. It is not encumbered with platitudes, and is written in a very attractive style. The contributions to history are an elab orate recitation of the events of the war, and devoid of boasting or vanity. The message on the whole is able and eminently satisfactory. General Wheeler (D.) of Alabama—lt is a clear and comprehensive resume of events which transpired during an eventful period of our country's his tory. It will be referred to as one of the noted State papers. Representative Cummings (D.) of New York —It is a clear, concise state ment of facts, without speculation, suggestion or recommendation. I have an idea that the real message will be sent hereafter. Chairman Dingley of the Ways and Means Committee said: "The message is an excellent resume of the important events of the last year, with, the presen tation of an existing situation and val uable suggestions that will aid mater ially, at the proper time hereafter, in solving the different problems before us. It is to be noted that the President states that our revenue laws are work ing well, with no suggestion of any needed modification." Richardson (D.) of Tennessee, said: "Th 3 President makes a most interest ing and satisfactory review of the Span ish war. but it is disappointing that he failed to tell us what we are to do with the new possessions. It is just a> ap propriate now as it will be after the treaty of peace for him to tell us what is to be the future of the new territory. It might help get the treaty ratified, «f he had solved that problem. It is in teresting to note the fact that three fourths of the message relates to for eign affairs, and less than one-four T h to home matters. Banking and currency and all financial reform legislation, so troptrly promised in 1886, get no men tion, and our condition in respect to these matters is to be left unchanged." Bingham of Pennsylvania: "A. brave and clear comprehensive message, strong as the President is in the confi dence and esteem of the people, his message will insure greater confidence, if possible." Representative Bailey of Texas, the Democratic floor leader, was called from the House by the illness of his son. and asked to be excused from expressing views on the message. 

FOREIGN NEWSPAPER COMMENT. LONDON, Dec. s.—Much having been expected, there is a certain tone of dis appointment in the morning paper ed itorials on President McKinley's mes sage. Its non-committal character is attributed to the fact that the negotia tions of the Peace Commissioners at Paris are not finished. Considerable satisfaction is expressed at the refer ences to Anglo-American relations, and at the coldness displayed toward Russia. The "Times" says: "It is creditable to both the dignity and good sense of the American people that a message an nouncing the victorious ending of the great war, the acquisition of territory and the initiation of an imperialist pol icy is sober in tone and moderate in recommendations. Not since England recognized the United States Govern ment as a Power has an American President alluded to the mother country in language so cordial and friendly as Mr. McKinley's." In commenting on the "President's surprising language concerning the Nicaragua Canal, which utterly ignores British treaty rights, the "Daily Chron icle" says that "this latter will ari.e ere long in a more acute form." The editorial highly approves Mr. McKinley's references to China and Great Britain. 

SPANISH BANK OF CUBA. Will Advance No More Money to the Government. NEW YORK, Dec. 5.—A dispatch to the "Tribune" from Havana says: The straits of the Spanish authorities for money gave rise to a sensational epi sode last week. Captain General Cas tellanos went in person to the Spanish Bank of Cuba and demanded $850 in cash. He was accompanied by subordi nate officials. After making the de mand the Captain General offered a receipt or due bill of the Government. The President of the bank declared it had not the cash to meet the demand. The Captain General ordered the cash drawers to be opened by his subordi nates. This was done, but no money was obtained. A meeting of the directors was then called. Instead of finding means to satisfy the Government, they indorsed the refusal of the President to supply funds, and affirmed a notice previously sent to depositors asking them to with draw their deposits temporarily from the bank, because of its semi-official relation to the Spanish Government. It has heretofore submitted to these enforced contributions, but the execu tion of tardy American control caused the decision to be taken to advance no more funds. Though American au thority was not established on Decem ber Ist as expected, there was no prob ability of the bank yielding to Castel lano's demand. Other financial institu tions support its position. When the Spanish troops* evacuated Holguin, in Santiago province, the military commander went to the Hol guin branch of the Spanish Bank and forcibly took what cash there was and left a Government due bill. The in cident had given warning to the direct ors of the parent institution in Hava na, and they had prepared for a visil from the Captain General. Notwithstanding the Captain Gener al's failure to obtain money, the dis satisfaction of the troops over their pay is repressed, and the embarkation contir jies without interruption. 

CONDUCT OF THE WAR. •— ~ Resolution Introduced in the Directing an Investigation. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Representa tive Sulzer of New York, ranking mem ber of the House Committee on Mili tary Affairs, has introduced a resolu tion "authorizing and directing the Committee'on Military Affairs to in vestigate the War Department and the conduct of the Spanish war." The resolution follows: Resolved, that the Committee on Military Affairs and the same hereby is authorized and directed to investigate the War Department and the conduct of the recent war between Spain and the United States, and report all of said proceedings, with the findings, conclusions and recommendations, to the House of Representatives with all convenient speed; that said committee is hereby authorized and empowered to send for documents, books and pa pers, persons, and examine persons un der oath in any part of the United States, employ a stenographer, and that the Sergeant-at-Arms is hereby di rected to attend said committee and carry out its directions; that the nec essary expenses of the investigation be paid out of the contingent fund of the House. The resolution was referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. SUNDAY'S STORM. Plays Havoc With Telegraph Serv ice in the Bast. NEW YORK, Dec. s.—Last night's storm played havoc with many of the telegraph wires running out of New York. The sleet and snow which ac companied it in the region known to the telegraph men as the "Lake Region," including the territory from Buffalo to Chicago, along the Lake Shore and other railroads, was responsible for the most distressing delay which the com panies experienced. Both through and local service to all points was effective to-day, although business is accepted "subject to delay." Every direct route is open except that between Butler, Pa., and Chicago. Along the lake region the Western Union is hampered materially, the lines which run beside the Pittsburg and Western and the Ohio division of the Erie suffering the greatest delays. The work of replacing the wires is being carried through with as much expe diency as possible, and it is confidently expected to have the whole system in working order by to-morrow, and with the exception of wires in the lake re gion, where the storm has accomplish ed considerable damage. THE MEXICAN MISSION. It Will he Advanced to the Rank « of an Embassy. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Senor Don Matias Romero, the Mexican Minister to Washington, has returned to this city from the City of Mexico. He called at the State Department to-day to pay his respects to Secretary Hay, and in the course of his visit took oc casion to inform him that his Gov ernment had determined to advance the Mexican Mission here to the rank of an Embassy. As the law provides that the United States may advance to the rank of Embassador any of its Ministers when the country to which they are accred ited takes the first step in that direc tion with their own* representative, Powell Clayton, at present the United States Minister to Mexico, will become Embassador of the United States to Mexico as soon as the necessary .formalities can be gone through with. 

PEACE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS. Spanish Commissioners Fighting to Obtain More Concessions. Appeal to Americans to Be Generous on the Minor Points. Much Accomplished at Yesterday's Joint Session—Eight Open Ques tions Canvassed, Seven Being Practically Settled Without Noteworthy Friction. PARIS, Dec. s.—The American Peace Commission had a long conference, be ginning at 10-o'clock, and only had a brief recess for lunch before going to the Foreign Office to meet the Spanish Commissioners at 3 o'clock p. m. The Americans apparently had changed the form, if not the substance, of some of their demands, as a result of the deliberations during the past three days. Secretary Moore of the United States Commission was engaged far into the night in revising the draft of the treaty of peace. The Joint Commission was in session for over four hours. Much of the dis cussion concerned details as to the guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish citizens in the ceded colonies. The de bate was occasionally energetic, and the Spaniards, on adjourning, appeared to be dejected. Secretary Ojeda of the Spanish Commission, when ques tioned after the meeting as to the progress made, answered excitedly: "I am almost mad. I cannot talk. We are making progress." The American Commissioners de clined to say anything further than that the progress made was satisfac tory. The Spanish Commissioners have re ceived authority to bind their Gov ernment on certain matters, but there are yet important questions on which their instructions are unsatisfactory, and it is likely that many of the de tails involved in the change of sover eignty in the Spanish colonies will be left for settlement in the regular diplo matic progress, when relations between the two Governments are resumed. The history of the document which will certify the passing of the oldest colonial Power in the world and the advent of the newest was epitomized by Judge Day this evening in a single sentence: "A peace treaty can contain anything which the victors put into it." The Americans had listened for hours with their customary patience to the technicalities'convoked by the Span iards, with their customary shrewd ness and persistency, against every proposal making for the dismember ment of their empire. Darkness had come on, and the liveried attendants mobilized by the French authorities had placed a lamp at the elbow of each Commissioner. Senator Frye, whose unconcealed contempt for diplo matic quibbling excites the astonish ment of the punctiilious Castillians, had stalked home, his patience ex hausted. The burden of the Spanish arguments was that matters outside bare cession and evacuation of the conquered ter ritories, which the Americans propose to cover by treaty, were beyond the legitimate and customary scope of a peace treaty. Behind this bulwark Senor Montero Rios, President of th« Spanish Commission, fortified himself, bombarding his opponents with a sup ply of arguments and precedents which inspired the freely expressed admira tion of the Americans. Finally Judge Day summarized the American position in the foregoing memorable utterance. It was given and taken in good spirit, and from that moment the proceedings were en tirely friendly. The session accomplished much. Eiight open questions were canvassed, seven being practically settled without noteworthy friction. The Commissioners decline to say what conclusion was reached, but the bargain for a coaling station in the Carolines was not cemented, and, ac cording to present prospects, it is like ly to fail. The temper of the Ameri cans in this matter is: "We made you a good offer for an island. You may take it or leave it." The Spaniards seem disposed to leave it. The Americans do not regard it as a prize which they can demand as one of the natural fruits of the war. while the whole policy of the Span iards is to confine the negotiations as narrowly as possible to the letter of the protocol signed at Washington, and to exclude all extraneous matters. The result of this policy may be the leaving of many details involved in the change of sovereignty over the various pos sessions to settlement by the regular diplomatic processes, when normal re lations between the two Governments have been resumed. The Spanish Commissioners insisted at the previous meeting that the set tlement of the status of the Spaniards who remain in the colonies was a problem so closely akin to cession that it could not be logically separated from the latter, but should be consid ered next to the question of cession, and before such matters as coaling stations and religious toleration. They appealed to the Americans, having gained all the great points, to be gen erous on the minor ones. Accordingly, the American Commissioners, as fore shadowed by the correspondent of the Associated Press, w-ere conciliatory to day on the order of procedure as to the status of, Spaniards remaining in the lost colonies. The Spanish Commissioners continue fighting- with tooth and nail to procure every possible pecuniary and other con cession. The American's had already promised to guarantee the return of Spanish prisoners in the hands of the Filipinos. To-day Senor Montero Rios proposed that the United States should pay the expenses of shipping them to Spain, arguing with his customary in genuity that this was the duty of the Americans, as a matter of course. The Americans thought the request was un reasonable, and a good deal of time was consumed in discussing the ques tion. Another problem entailing long debate was the disposition to be made of the Spanish munitions of war in a number of military posts outside of Manila which the Americans have not captured. The Spanish Commissioners contende I that Spain should be permitted to ship such munitions home. The Americans replied that, as the United' States had conquered the Philippines, these muni tions were spoils of war. The Span iards finally waived their quibble. They appear resigned to the inevita ble, and now seem to realize that their best policy is to'save as much from the wreck as their keenness in raising tech nicalities can secure for them. The question of the status of the Spaniards in the West Indies and the Philippines who wish to remain there was nearly settled, as well as certain commercial questions involving the rights of shipping under the Spanish flag, which will be given advantages. 

WEYLER WILL SUPPORT SAGASTA MADRID, Dec. s.—lmmediately after the signing of the treaty of peace, Pre mier Sagasta will submit to the Queen Regent a question of confidence. It is thought probable that her majesty will ask Senor Sagasta to remain in power in which case the Cortes will be con voked for January 7th. From the declaration of General Wey ler, it is believed that a combination of the followers of Senor Sagasta. Ro mero Robledo and General Weyler will be affected as soon as peace is signed. General Weyler, in an interview, has pronounced against the Conservatives, declaring that Cuba was) the only ques tion which separated him from the Lib erals. He considers the internal crisis grave, "in view of the attitude of Great Britain, which by encouraging civil war, desires to do with Spain what ;he United States has done with her col onies." Under these circumstances, Weyler added, he considers that a Sagasta- Robledo Cabinet would be the most able to cope with the situation. Senor Groizard, Minister of Justice, has called the attention of the Papal Nuncio to the conduct of the clergy in the country districts near Barcelona, Saragossa Pampeluna and Madrid in openly advocating the Carlist cause from the pulpit. The Government has ordered increased precautions for the protection of railways in the Carlist districts. The body of the late King Alfonso XII. was solemnly transferred last week, in accordance with the custom, from the vault in the Escurial, whore the bodies of the Spanish Kings are left to mummify, to a magnificent per manent vault, after an elaborate cere mony for formal identification. MAY BE TWO TREATIES. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The impres sion prevails here that the results of the negotiations at Paris will be em bodied in two or more treaties instead of one. There will be one actual peace treaty, embodying nothing more than the protocol points relating to the relin quishment of Spanish sovereignty over Cuba and the Spanish West Indies, Guam and the Philippines, with the sin gle exception of the proviso for the re lease of prisoners. All the other matters, those relating to the renewal of the commercial trea ties, the acquisition of cable and coal ing stations, and, in fact, all those mat ters that have been mentioned as likely to be incorporated in the peace treaty will form the subject of a special treaty. This course is likely to be adopted in order to hasten the conclusion of peace, of which there is a great neces sity, if for no other reason than to se cure the release of prisoners and the restoration of trade between Spain aud the United States. There has been no evidence of any friction between the American Com missioners. It is supposed, in fact, it is known, that in their own session they have differed about some points, and have discussed these at length, but whenever it came to the points of ac tion in the joint commission, the Amer icans were united. The last dispatch received from them was unanimous, bearing the signature of every mem ber of the commission. ANGLO-VENEZUELAN DISPUTE. The Latter's Brief in the Boundary Line Case Completed. INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. s.—Venezue la's brief in the dispute over the boun dary line between that country and British Guiana will go to the printer this week. The work of preparing the brief was completed by former Presi dent Harrison last week, and for four days ex-Secretary Benjamin F. Tracy, S. M. Provost and J. R. Soley of New York, associated with General Harri son in the case, have been here in final conference over the document. General Harrison, accompanied by his wife and E. P. Tibbett, his private secretary, will depart for Paris the latter part of March to attend the meeting of the board to which the dis pute has been referred. TAXATION OF RAILWAYS. A Decision Rendered by the Uuited States Supreme Court. WASHINGTON, Dec. f>. — In the United States Supreme Court a decis ion was rendered by Justice McKenna in the case of the Territory of New Mexico against the United States Trust Company and the receiver of the Atlantic and Pacific Railway. The case involved the right of the Terri torial authorities to tax the improve ments of the railway company on its right of way, without taxing the right of way itself. The decision did not sustain this contention, but affirmed the decision of the Territorial Supreme Court adverse to the taxation of the concession. The First Bill in the House. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Represen tative Cousins of lowa has the honor of introducing the first bill in the House at this session of Congress. It is entitled "A bill declaring the Stand ard of Value in the United States," and provides that the standard of value in the United States is hereby declared to be and is the standard gold dollar of twenty-five and eight tenths grains of standard gold, 900 fine. Schooner Ashore. BLOCK ISLAND (R. I.), Dec. 5.— An unknown three-masted schooner is ashore on Clay Head, and is going to pieces. The schooner ran ashore during the heavy gale last night. The crew was taken off in the breeches buoy. WHOLE INTO. 17,949. EXPENSES OF THE GOVERNMENT.
