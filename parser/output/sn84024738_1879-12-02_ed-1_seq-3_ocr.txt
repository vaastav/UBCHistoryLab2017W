The reports cf the Secretary of the Inte rior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, setting forth the present state of our relations with the Indian tribes on our territory, the measures taken to advance their civilization and prosperity, and the progress already achieved by them, will be I found of more than ordinary interest. The ' general conduct of our Indian population lias been so satisfactory that the occurrence i o! two disturbances, which resulted in f bloodshed and destruchon of property, is ali the more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak on the White river Ute reservation in western Colorado has become so familiar by elaborate reports in the public press that its remarkable inci dents need not be stated here in detail. It i> expected that the settlement of this diffi culty will lead to such arrangements as will prevent fuither hostile contact between the Indians and the border settlements in west ern Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at the Mtscalero :<gency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small band of ma rauder*, after committing many atrocities, bein^ vigorously chased by a military force, made his way across the Mexican border and i< now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in which a com paratively small number of Indians were engaged, aic most deplorable, a vast nra 1 iarity of our Indian population have fully Jas7)fiei\ vi'.e expectations of itiose who be lieve that by bumuneand peaceful influences Indian can b" led to abandon the habits f,I savage life and to develop a capacity for useful and civilized occupations. What '.bey have already accomplished in the pur suit of agricultural and mechanical work, hie remarkable success which ban attended hie experiment ol employing as freighters > * class of Indians hitherto counted among i tir wildest and most intractable, aud the V general and urgent desire expressed by ' 'hew for the education of their children, Ul3V he taken as sufficient proof that t!)ey will be round capable of accomplish ing much more if thev continue to hewisely >ndftirly guided. Tbe <? Indian policy" fetched in the report of the Secretary of jhe Interior, the object of which is to make ?iberal provision for the education of Indian fouth, to settle the Indians upon farm-iots & seveialiy, to give them title In fee to ^Irfarmg," inalienable for* certain number I o! years, and when their wants are thus V Jfovided for to disjxjse by sale of the. land* B ^hieir reservations not occupied and used ?

I also IrSiL, e, 1H>commend8tion made in my 1 the homestend act, and to gnihtthc? pat ent* containing the same provision ot In alienability. for a certain period. Tho experiment Of sending a number of Indian children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Norma! and Agricultural Insti tute-, in Virginia, to receive an element iry English education and practical instruction in farrotng and o'her useful industries has led to results so promising that it was thought expedient to turn over the cavalry b'i rracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the Interior Department for the establishment ot an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now one hundred and fifty-eii?tit pupils, selected from various tribe?, and is' in full operation. Arrangements are also made for the education of a number ot In dian boys and cirls belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope in a similar manner ut Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institu tions will eocnmencl themselves to the libe rality of Congress, and to the philanthropic muni licence of the American people. Last snriog information was received of the organization of an extensive movement in the western States, the object of which was the occupation by unauthorized per sons of certain lands In the Indian Terri tory ceded by the C'tierokees to the Govern ment for the purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the 20th of April I issued a proclama tion warning all persons against participa tion in such nn alteropr, and by the co operation of a military force the invasion was promptly checked. It Is my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian inhabit ants of that Territory to the full extent or the Executive power. But it would be unwise to ignore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with a population so sparse and with so great a wealth of unused resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attempts as happened this year, when the surrounding States are morn densely settled, and the westward movement of our population looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under such circumstances the difficulty of maintaining the Indian Territory in its present state will greatly in crease, and the Indian tribes inhab iting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fullv approve of the advice civen to them bv the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to di vide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can culti vate. to acquire individual title in fee, in stead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. By adopting Mich a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves the value of their possessions, and at the same time pro mote their progress in civilization and pros perity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present state of things iu the Territory. The qu?stion whether a change in the control ol the Indian service should be raad<\ was in the Forty-fifth Congress re ferred to a joint committee of both houses for inquiry and report. In my last, annual message I expressed the hope that the deci sion of that question, then in prospect, would arrest further agitation of this sub ject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as the Indians themselves." Since tnen, the committee having reported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote in the House of Representatives. For the reasons here stated, and in view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will l?e calculated to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of the service, and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and improvement of the In dians, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its last session be permitted to stand. The efforts made by the Department of the Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber-lands of the United States have' been continued, and have met with consid I erable success. A large number of cases of trespass have been prosecuted in the courts of the United States; others have been set tled, the trespassers offering to make pav ment to the Government for the value of the timber talcen by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turn ed into the Trea-ury far exceed in amount the sums appropriated by Congress for this purpose. A more important result, how ever, consists in the fact that the destruc tion of our public forests by depredation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in extent, and it is pro bable that if the present policy is vigorously pursued and sufficient pro vision to that end is made by Con gress, such trespasses, at least those on a lar^e scale, can be entirely suppressed, except in the Territories where timber for the daily requirements of the population cannot, "under the present slate of the law, be otherwise obtained. I therefore earn estly invite the attention of Congress to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a law be enacted ena bling the Government to sell timber from the public lands without conveying the fee, where such lands are principally valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to conform to domestic wants and business requirements, while at the same time guarding against a sweeping de struction of the forest*. The enactment of such a law appears to become a more press ing necessity every uay. JVIv recommendations in former messages are renewed in favor of enlarging the fa cilities of the Department of Agriculture, Agriculture is the leading interest and the permaoeut industry of our people. It is to the abundance of agricultural production, as compared with our home consumption, and the largely-increased and highly profitable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we are mainly indebted for our present prosperity as a people. We must look for its continued maintenance to the same substantial resource. There is no branch of industry in which labor, directed by sci entific knowledge, yields sucli increased, production in comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch of the public service to which the encouragement of liberal ap propriations can be more appropriately ex tended. The omission to render such aid is wot a wise economy; but, on the con trary. undoubtedly results in losses of im mense sums annually that might be saved through well-directed efforts by the Gov ernment to promote this vital interest. The results already accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agri culture ts an earnest of what may be ex pected with increased appropriations for the several purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner, with a view to placing the Department upon a footing which will enable it to prosecute more effectively the objects for which it is estab lished. Appropriating are needed for a more complete laboratory, for the establishment of a veterinary division and a division of forestry, and for an increase of force. The requirements for these and other purposes indicated in the report of the Commissioner under the head of the imme diate necessities of the Department, will uot Involve any expenditure of money that the country caunot with propriety now un dertake in "the inteiests of agriculture It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of Education the extent to which educa tional privileges throughout? the United States have, been advanced during the year. I No more fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress than that of devising appro-' j priate measures of financial aid to educa ' tion, supplemental to local action in the States and Territories and in the District of Columbia. The wise forethought of the founders of our Government has not only furnished the basis for the support of the common-school systems of the newer States, but laid fhe foundations for the mainte nance of their universities and colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts.

Tbe location of such a public building, which should provide for tbe pressing necessities of the present and for tbe vast increase of the nation'* books In the future, is a matter wfiicb addresses itself to the discretion of Congress. If Is earnestly recommended as a measure which should unite all suffrages, and which should no longer be delayed. The Joint commission created by the act of Congress of August 2, 1876, for the pur pose of supervising and directing the com pletion of the Washington Natioual monu ment, of which commlssiou tbe President is a member, has given careful attention to this subject, and already the *trengthening of the foundation has so far progressed as to insure the entire success of this part of the work. A massive layer of masonry has been introduced below the oriainal founda tion, widening the base, increasing the sta bility of tbe structure, and rendering it possible to carry the shaft to completion. It is? earnestly recommended that such fur ther appropriations be made for the con tinued prosecution of tbe work as may be necessary for the completion of this na tionnl monument at an early day. In former messages, impressed with (be importance of the subject, I have taken oc casion to commend to Congress the ndoi> tion of a generous policy towards the Dis trict of Columbia. The report of the Com missioners of the District, herewith trans mitted, contains sueaestions and recom mendations, to all of which I earnestly in vite your careful attention. I ask your early and favorable consideration of the views which they express as to the urgent need of legislation for the reclama* ion of the marshes of the Potomac and "its eastern branch, within the limits of the city, and Tor the repair of the streets of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now by decay rendered almost impassable and a source of imminent danger, to the health of its citizens. The means at the dis posal of the Commissioners are wholly in adequate for the accomplishment of these important works, and should be supple mented by timely appropriations from the Federal treasury. The filling of the flat* iu front of the city will add to the adjacent lands and parks now owned by the United States, a large and valuable domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its entire cost; and will also, as an incidental result, secure the permanent im provement of the river for the purposes of navigation. The Constitution having invested Con gress with supreme and exclu-ive jurisdic tion over the District of Columbia, its citi zens must of necessity look to Congress alone for all needful legislation affectine their interests ; and as the territory of this District is the common property of the people of the United States, who, equally with its resident citizens, are interested in the prosperity of tbeir cnpitul, I cannot doubt that you will be amply sustained by the general voice of the country in any measures you may adopt for this purpose. I aKo invite the favorable consideration of Congress to the wants of the public schools of this District as exhibited in the report of the Commissioners. While the number of pupils is rapidlv increasing, no adequate provision exists for a'correspond ing increase of school accommodation, and the Commissioners are without the means to meet this urgent need. A number of the buildings now used for school purposes are rented, and are, in important, particulars, Junsuited for the purpose.. The cause of popular education in the District or Colum bia is surely entitled to the same considera tion at the "hands of the National Govern ment as in the several States and Territo ries, to which munificent, grants of the pub lic lands have been made for the endow ment of schools and universities. 

RUTHERFORD B. HAYES. Executive Mansion, December 1, 1879. Tbe Rckdjusters arc more anxious to carry tbeir point in regard to scaling the debt thau to elect a Democratic senator, and in this spirit tlicv bave also had some of their members here during tbe week trying to arrange terms with the Administration. One member of tbe Cabinet has at least been consulted, and a leading western Re publican senator has also been brought into tbe matter. Tbe Rettdjuslersmaken square proposition that if the Administration and the Republican leaders here will control tbe Republican members of tbe-L'-'firislature and get them to vote with tbe Reiidjusters so as to make a majority, the latter will vote with tbe Republicans and elect a Republican to the Senate in place of Mr. Withers. In so many words, this is a trade proposi tion by which they can sccurc a United States senator if they will vote to repudiate about thirty million dollars of Virginia debt. The Administration cannot, of course, be come a party to any such transaction, and the Republican members of the Legislature will be left free to exercise tbeir own judg ment about the matter. The President has, on several occasions, told Yirgmia Repub licans that he thought it their duty to vote to protect tbe credit of tbe State, and not, to repudiate her solemn pleases.?

There was largely over a quorum of both houses pres ent to-day, and member seemed as liind aud as cordial to each other 39 achool-bov? after vacation. In the Senate the desks of Senators Eaton, Davis of West Virginia, Thurinan, Whyte, and Kirk wood were decorated with large baskets of rare flow ers, and popular members of the Ifou'e were similarly complimented. The Vice President and the Speaker of the House were the recipients of splendid collections, and the large number of ladles (visitors) evidently envied them. The galleries of both houses were well tilled, but there was nothing like the crowd that usually attends when the' House has to be organized. The business was purely routine, and the hand shaking was the most interesting feature of the occasion. In the Senate, the chaplain, Dr. BuIIoek, prayed Tor the family of the late Senator Chandler, and for Senator Da vis, of Illinois, who recently lost his wife. The 'opening proceedings were brief and uninteresting. PERSONAL NEWS ITEMS. No one was disappointed to-day wlien the name of Secretary MeCrary was sent to the Senate to till the Iowa United States judge ship. A. F. Gibbens was nominated for postmaster of Charleston, W. Va. There is quite a contest over the Huntington post mastership. A. B. Duesberry, of Rich mond, waj in the Senate gallery to-day. Colonel W. E.

The Bayard men call attention to tbe lac1; tbat several of Mr. Eandall's congressional friends wben recently interviewed express ed tbe belief tbut tbe distinguished Senator from Delaware cannot carry New York, and draw the inrere?ce that tbe Speaker of the House and bis friends are against bis nomination. In spite of this the Bayard men claim that their favorite is gaining strength daily in Pennsylvania as well as elsewhere.. The advocates of Mr. Seymour are conciliatory, and have at every turn to deny the report tbat he will not accept. No one says anything unkiud of him, and all concede that if he will run that be can carry New York. I beard a Seymour man to-day assert with a knowing air that Hen dricks will accept tbe second place on a Seymour ticket. I found a leading stal wart journalist in a talking humor this eve ning, and I said : " Your party will nomi nate Grant." <4 No," said be ; u it isn't by a long shot. Now, we won our recent victo torics with what you call tbe bloody shirt. Tln-re was no conciliation and none of Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup about it. To per fect it we mean to elect a stalwart Presi dent and reap the full fruits of a stalwart victory. We are afraid of Grant. All of Lis recent utterance? have been for peace and conciliation. He is bidding for conser vative support, and must reward, if elected, conservative supporters. We want no di vision, but mean to have all of the spoils for ourselves. That is plain talk," said he, " but it is honest, as distasteful as it may be to you sautberners." "Who, then, will you nominate?" I asked. ** Why, Blaine or Sherman." This interview staggered me a little, but I closed it by saying, " You will noininato Grant, and wc will beat him." THE POLITICAL OCTLOOK IN* CONGRESS. Of course this will be, as everybody says, a political session, and congressmen will devote themselves to making-a President. Up to Christmas the indications now arc that it will be quiet, but the Republicans are on the alert, eager to spring any ques tion that will help them and hurt the Dem ocrats. Their main design, according to leaky Radical vessels, is to divide the Lem oeratic pirty on linance and array the West against the East. This, they think, will slaughter Bayard on the one hand, and Ihurman and Hendricks on the other, and make a Republican victory next fall easy. The Democrats have a delicate rdle to play, and, as a sagacious southern leader says, they will have to be as wise as ser pents and a9 harmless as doves. And yet I have beard to-day several protni neBt Democratic members of the House declare that there is no way of avoiding a renewal of the fight over the issues of last session. This is what the Republicans say tbey want, and they smile as they add, And Mr. Hayes can veto bills and call extra sefc si9ns every fifteen minutes between July and December, and then not hurt either himself or his party by so doing. The Re publicans, it is easy to see already, mean to have a long session, and it i9 to their inter est to have one. On the other hand, Sena tor Johnston, when he remarked to a party of Virginians to-day that be wanted an ad journment by March, 9bowed that he com prehended the situation; and that is the feeling of all the most sagacious Democrats I have conversed with.

The first was introduced by Mr. McDonald May 6th, and its object is to prohibit military Interference nt election'. The second was introduced by the same Senator May 22d, and is enti tled a bill to authorize the employment of the militia and the land and naval forces of the United States in certain cases and for other purposes. A WISE MEASURE OF REFORM. Last winter Mr. Potter's bill to remove all war claims and other private claims not including pensions from Congress to the Court of Claims passed the House by a two-thirds vote and ought to have passed tlie Senate. Senator Johnston has an nounced that be will introduce substantially the same bill in the Senate at an early day. It is a wi<?e measure 01* legislative reform, and the sooner it becomes a law the better for the country. Tbe Court of Claims is Republican, and the Democratic party and the South cannot be held responsible for its awards to loyal southern claimants. The Republicans do not want the bill to pas'. A RICHMOND CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT. At a recent term of tlie United States Circuit Court at Richmond, in the ca3e of Garnettv.s. Rosenbaum, Judge Bond re fused an appeal to the defendant, against whom he had decided the case. Judge Meredith thereupon applied to the Su preme Court of the United States for a mandamus to require the Judge to grant an appeal. Tbe case was to-day argued in the Supreme Court by Judge Meredith and \Y. A. Maury for Rosenbaum, and John Howard and Major Robert Stiles for Gar nett. . MEMBER3 OF PARLIAMENT. Messrs.
