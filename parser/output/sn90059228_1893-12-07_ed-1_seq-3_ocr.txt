SUCH reeommen la Ln as appeal to he at this particular time appropriate. Peaceful Foreiorn Kelations. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrassing situations remain that will not yield to the spirit of fair ness and love of justice, which, Joined with con sistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. Argentine and Brazil Boundary Question. My predecessor having accepted the office of arb.iraior of the Ion.' standing missions bound ary dispute, tendered to the president of the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those states to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their re spective governments Tlie Brazilian Insurrection. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United Staies alert to watch the interests of our citizens in tnat country, with which we carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now and f^rsome lime Lave en stationed at Rio lie Janeiro. The struggle being between the established government, \vhuh controls tha. machinery of aaministration, and With which* we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command in an atiael- upon the national cap.tal and chief seaport, and lucking, as it does, the elements of di vided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recog nitiun us belligerents. Thus fur the position of our government has been that of ana tentive but impartial observer of the unfortunate con flict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impar tial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as now exists. I deemed it necessary to disavow in a manner not to be mi-understood the un authorized action of our late naval commander in tno.-.e waters in saluting the revolted Brazil ian admiral, being in i is posed to countenauce un act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local Insurrection. Chilian Cla im Question. The convention between our government and Chili, having fur its object the settlement and adjustment of the demands of the two countries a-iumst each other, t.as been mails effective by the organ:z uiou of the claims commission pro vided'.or. Toe two governments failing io agree upon the tmrd niter of the commission, ttie s-ood offices of tne president of the Ssvn.-s republic were invoked, as ovided in ihe treaty, and the selfcLion of the Swiss repre sentative in this country to complete the organ ization was gratifying alike to the United States und Chili. The vexatious question of so culled legalit asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chill by the unauthorized action of the lute United States minister in receiving into his of licial residence two persons who hud just failed in an attempt at revolution and uffa'ust uhom crirn nal cuartres were pending gr.win,' out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as appl i to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedents, and, when ai.owed, tentls to eucouruge sedition and htr.fe. Under no c.rcumstancrs can the repre sentative? of this government be permitfd, under the ill-defined action of extra territorial ity, to interrupt the adm.nistrutii.n of criminal justice in the countries to which they are ac irediied A temperate demand liav.ug been made by the Chilian government for the correc tion of this conduct in the instance mentioned, the minister was instructed no longer to har bor the offenders. liiin-s,. Hngistratioii. The legislation of iast year, known as the Geary taw. requiring the registration of all Ohiu-se laborers entitled' to residence in tne United Siates. and the deportation of all not u-t.mplying with the provisions of the act within the time prescribed, met With much opposition trt.m CninameD in this country. Acting upon the advice of t-mintnt counsel that the law was unconstitutional, great mass of Chinese laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to its val idity, iu good faith tieciiued to uppiy for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon pro eeding by habeas corpus was brought betore tiie supreme court, and on May 15. 1.-93, a dec.si^n was made bv that tribunal sustaining tne law. It is ueiieved that under the recent amendment of the act extending tlie time for registration the Chi nese laborers thereto entitled wno desire tore Bide in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of estab lishing by lawful procedure their right to re maiu. and that thereby the necessity of en forced deportation may to a great degree be avoided. 'Ihe Murder of Missionaries In China. It has devo.veu upon the United Slates min ister at Pe^in. as dean oi the diplomatic body nnd in the ub-ence of a representative of Sweden and Norway, 10 press upon the Chinese government reparation for the retent mur ler if Swedi missionaries at Sung-Pu. This question is of vital interest to all countries Whose citizens engage in missionary work in the Interior. The Slave Trade in Africa. By article tt of the general act of Brussels, signed July \ev, for ttie suppression of ttie slave trade and the restriction of certain in jurious commerce in the independent state of the Corwo. and in the adjacent zone of Central Africa, the United States and the other signa tory powers agreed to adopt appropriate means fur the punishment of persons selling arms and ammunition the natives and for the confisca tion of the inhibited articles. It being the plain duty of this government to aid iu suppressing the nefarious traffic, im pairing as it does the praisewonhv and civ ilizing efforts now in progrwss In that region. I recommend that an act be passed prohibiting the sale of arms and Intoxicants to the natives in the regulated zone by our citizens. Kxtradltlon Treaties. Costa Rita has lately testified its friendli ness by surrendering to the United Slates, in the absence of a convention of extradition, but Upon duly subm tted evidence of criminality, a noted fugitive from ju.stioe. It is trusted ihat the negotiation of a treaty wiih that country to meet recurring cases of this kind will soon be accomplished In my opinion treaties for reciprocal extradition shouid be concluded with all those countries with which the United Slates has not already conventional arrange in' nts of that character. I have deemed it fitiing to express to the governments of Costa Kica and Colombia the 1 tldly desire of ttie United States to see their pending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years sgo. The French Republic. Our relations with the French republio con tinue to be intimate and cordial. 1 sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, as amemied by the senate, will soon be operative. Germany. While occasional questions, affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their birth, have arisen in our intercourse with Germany, our relations with that country con tinue satisfactory. Great Britain. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit Of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress be tween the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award and regulations agreed upon by the Behring sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective and it is not doubted that Great Britain will cooperate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. Th dispute, growing out of the discriminat ing tolls imposed in the Welland canal, upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was adjusted by the substitution of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my prede cessor thereupon suspended his proclamation imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit .through our canals. A request for ad ditions to the list of extraditable offenses cov ered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration. Hayti. During the past year an American citizen em ployed in a subordinate commercial position in Hayti, after suffering a protracted imprison ment oh an unfounded charge of smuggling, wag finally liberated on judicial examination. Upon urgent representation to the Havtien government a suitable indemnity was paid to the sufferer. By a law of Hayti a sailing vessel having discharged her cargo is refused clear ance until the duties on such cargo have been paid. The hardship of this measure upon American shipowners who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country has been In sisted on with a view of securing the removal at this Muse of complaint. Honduras. Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American mail steamer touching at the port of Ainapala, because her captain re fused to deliver up passengers in transit from Nicaragua to Guatemala upon demand of the military authorities of Honduras, our minister to that ountry under instructions protested against the wanton act and demanded satis faction. Th government of Honduras, ac tuated b'y the sense of justice, and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the illegal conduct of its officers, and expressed staTerp regret for fhe occurrence. I is cThuiTently anticipated" that a satis factory adjustment will soon to reached of the esiions arising out of the seizure and use of iinurio.in vessels by insurgents in Honduras and the subsequent denial by the succcssiul jovtrtiaeut of commercial privileges to those /easels on that account. Republio of Idlx.-ia. A notable part ot the soutbtosterly coast of Liueria beiween Cavlly aud Sa Pedoro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally recognized as belonging to that republic by cessiou and purchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France in virtue of agreements entered into by the na tive tribes over whom Liberian control has not been well main tamed More recently, nego tiations between the Liberian represent ative and the French government re sulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby as an adjustment certain Liberian ter ritory is ceded to France. This convention at i.Vsi advices had not been ratified by the Liberian legislature and executive Feeling a sympathetic interest in the fortunes of this lit tle commonwealth, the establishment aud de velopment o" which were largely aided by the beiu voleuce of our countrymen, und which con stitutes the only independently sovereign slate on the west coast of Airtca, this government has suggested to the Freuoh government its earnesi concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia should take place without her uucon Btrained consent. Mexico. Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that close and frieudly nature which should always characterize the intercourse oi two neighboring republics. The work of relocating tne monu ments marking the boundary net ween me countries lroni i-aso del Norte to the Pacific is now nf-arly completed, 'the commission re cently organised un..er the conventions of li-al and I8s9 it is expected will speuuiiy settle dis putes growing out of the shilling currents of the Rio Grande river east of Li Paso. Mioaragua and Guatemala. Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the parts at hr^ successful hav ing in turn been displaced by another. Our newly-appointed minister, by his timely good offices, aided in a peaceful udjustmentof tne controversy involved iu the tlr3t conflict. Th large American interests established in Hu country in connection with the Nicaragua caual were not molested. Th canal company has, unfortunately, become UnaiiciatlysertOaSly embarrasseu, but a generous treatment has been extended to it by the government of Nic aragua. The United States are especially in terested in the successful achievement of the vast undertaking this compauv has in charge. 'I'nat should be accomplished under distinc tively American auspices, and its enjoyment assured, not only to tne Vessels of this country as a channel of communication between our At lantic and i'acitt" seaboards, but to ihe ships of the world in tne interests of civilization, is a proposition which, in my judgment, does not aduut of question. Guatemala has also been visited by the po litical Vicssiiudes which have afflicted her Central American neighbors, cut tne disso.u ttoii of her legis.ature and tne proclamation of a dictatorship have been unattended itu civil war. Kxtradltlon with Norway and Ku.-ia. An extradition treaty with Norway has re cently been proclaimed and exciiaugcd. The extradition treat/ with Russia, signed in March, 1-87, aud amended and confirmed by the senate in February last, was duty proclaimed last June. The Samoan Troubles. Led by desire to compose differences and con tribute to the restoration oi order in Samoa, winch for some years previous hud been the scene of conflicting foreign pretensions and na tive strife, the United stales, departing from its policy consecrated by a Century of observ ance, entered four years ago into ihe treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming Jointly bound with England and Germany to establish and maintain Matietou Laupepa as king of Samoa. Th treaty provided for a foreign cout of justice a municipal council for t.,e dis trict of Apia, with a foreign president thereof, authorized to advise the king a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, und a revenue system lor the kingdom. I imposed upon the three powers that part of the cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the islands. t&arly in the lite of this triple protectorate the native dissensions it was designed to quell revived. Rivals defied ihe authority of tne new king, refusing to pay taxes and de manding the election of a ruler by native suf frage. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, and a large number of his adherents were in open rebellion on one of the islands Quite lately. ai the request of the other powers, and in ful Ullment of its treaty obligation, this govern ment agreed to unite in a joint military move ment oi such dimensions as would probably se cure the surrender of the insurgents without bioodsned. The warship Philadelphia was ac cordingly put under orders for Samoa, but be fore she arrived the threatened conflict was precipitated by King Matietoa's at tack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa was deieated and a number of men killed. Th British and German naval ves sels present subsequently secured the surren der of Mataafa aud his adherents. Th defi ated ohief and ten of his principal support ers were deported to a German island of ih Marshall group, where they are held as prison ers under the joint responsibility and cost of the three powers. This incident and the events leading up to it singularly illustrate the impoliuy of establish ing alliances with foreign powers. Relations with Spain. More than fifteen years ago this government preferred a claim against Spain in behalf of one of our citizens, for properly seized and confis cated in Cuba. In lwsti the claim was adjusted, Spain agreeing to pay, unconditionally, as a fair indemnity, .1,800,000. A respectful but earnest note was recently addressed to the /punish government insisting upon prompt ful fillment of its long-neglected obligation. Other claims preferred by the United States against Spain, in behalf or American citizens for prop erty confiscated in Cuba, have been pending for many years. At the time Spain's title to the Caroline Is lands was confirmed by arbitration that gov ernment agreed that the rights which had been acquired there by American missionaries should be recognized and respected. Tt is sin cerely hoped that this pledge will be observed by ahowiug our missionaries, who were removed from Ponape to a place of safely by a United Stales warship during the late troubles be tween the Spanish garrison and the natives, to return to their fields of usefulness. The reproduced caravel, Santa Maria, built by Spain and sent to the Columbian exposition, has been presented to the United States in token of amity and in commemoration of the event it was designed to celebrate. I recom mend that, in accepting this gift, congress make grateful recognition of the sincere friend ship which prompted it. The Outrages In Turkey. Important matters have demanded attention in our relations with the Ottoman porta Th firing and partial destruction, by an unre strained moh, of one of the school buildings of Anatoliacoi-ege, established by citizens of the United States at Marsovan, and the apparent Indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwithstanding the com plicity of some of its officials, called for earnest remonstrance, which was followed by promises of reparation and punish ment of the offenders. Indemnity for the in jury io the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American owners secured, and efficient protection guar anteed. Information received of maltreatment suf fered by an inoffensive American woman en gaged in missionary work in Turkish Koordis tan was followed by such representations to tne pone as resulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of her assailants, the re moval of a delinquent official, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens engaged in mission and other lawful work in that quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this country not to identify them selves in good faith with our people, but with the intention of returning to tbo land of their birtb and there engaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without founda tion A journal published in this country in the Armenian language opcnlv counsels its readers to arm, organize and participate in movements for the subversion of Turkish authority in the Asiatic provinces. Th Ottoman government has announced its intention to expel from its dominions Armenians who have obta' I nat uralization in tbe United States since i. Will Protect Armenians. The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of sovereignty. I Is a right asserted and, to a limited extent, enforced by the United States with Ihe sanction of our highest court There being no naturalization treaty between the United Stateg and Turkey, our minister at Constantinople has been in structed that, while recognizing the right of that government to enforce its declared policy against naturalized Armenians, he is expected to protect them from unnecessary harshness of treatment. Relations with Venezuela. In view of the impaired financial resources of Venezuela, consequent^ upon the reoent revolu tion there, a modllieijp&rrangement for the sat isfaction of the awards of the late revisory claims commission, in progressive install ments, has been assented to and payments are being regularly made thereunder. Th boun dary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana is yet unadjusted. A restoration of diplomatic Intercourse between the republio and Great Britain and reference 'of the ques tion to impartial arbitration, would be a most gratifying consummation. Th ratification by Venezuela of the.conven tion.or the arbitration of the long deferred claim of the Venezuelan trans portation company, is awaited. The Hawaiian Affair. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to tbe installation of the present ad ministration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional government of the islands and tbe United States and submitted i the senate for ratification This treaty I withdrew for exam inution,and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount,of Georgia, to Honolulu as a Special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the cir cumstances attending the ofupon ment, and govern- all the conditionchange bearing the eubjeot of the treaty. After a thorough and ex haustive examination Mr Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted wiih the active aid of our representative to that government, and through the Intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of tbe United States which was landed for that purpose at the in stance of our minister. Upon the facts developed It seemed to me tbe only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and restore as far as prac ticable tbe status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accom plishing this result within tbe constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing ail our obligations and responsibilities growing out of any changed conditions brought by our unjustifiable interference, our present minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instruc tions to that end. A Special Message Forthcoming. Thus far no Information of the accomplish ment of any definite results bas been received from him. Additional advices are soon ex pected. When received they will be promptly test to the ijongruwi togattoc KlU all otafir, In- -t%-"*f.'"-.tJ"t-wYf,iwtinw :iMiiftiiiftiwam ii formation a hand,"" accompanied" b"y a special executive message fully detailing ail tbe facts necessary to a Comp.eie understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all tne materi al events leading up to the present situation. Favorable to Arbitration. a concurrent resolution, passed by the senate February 14, law. and by the house of representatives on the 3d of Apri. following, the presideut was requested to "invite.froin time to time, us occasions may arise, negotiation* with any government with whkh the United States has or may have diplomatic relations, to the end that any differences or u.s- pu arising between the two govern ments which cannot be adjusted by dip.o matic agency may be referred to arbitration and be peaceably adjusted by such means." April 18. 189v)r tn international American con lerenceof Washington by resolution expressed the wish thai all controversies between the re publics of America and the nations of Lurope mignt be settled by arbitration, and recom mended that the governmeni of each nation represented in that confeteiice should commu nicate this wish to all friendly powers A favorable response has beeu received from Great Britain in the shape of a resolution adopted in parliament Juiy 10 last, cordially sympathizing ^'ith ihe purpose in view, ana ex pressing the hope that her majesty govern ment will lend ready cooperation to lite govern ment of the United Stales upon the basis of ihe concurrent resolution above quoted I affords me gnai pleasure io lay tins parliamentary resolution before ine congress, ai.d io express my Bincere gratittcation that the seniiment of two great and kindred nations is thus authori tatively manifest iu favor of tne rational and peaceable settlement of international quarrels by honorable resort to arbitration. Grade of foreign Knvoys Raised. Since tlie passage of the act of March 3, 1893, authorizing ihe president to raise the grade 01 our envoys to correspond wiih the rank iu which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy ana Gcr li.uuy have couierred upon their representa tives at this cap.tal the title of ambassador, and I have respouoed by accredit.ng me agent o. the United states in those countries wan the same ti tie. A like elevation of mission is announced by Russia, aud when uiaao win be s.nuiarty met. Tina step ilttulgly comports wiih tuc position the United States hoids in the family of na tions. During my former administration 1 tooit occasion to recommend a recast of the laws re lating to ihe consular service in order tnat it might become a more efficient agency in ihe promotion of ihe interests it was intended io subserve. The duties ana powers of consult: have beeu ixpanded with the growing require ments oi our loivign trade. Discharging im portant duties ufleciing our commerce anc American citizen-, abroad, and in certain couu tries txercising judicial functions, these oltt cers shouid be men of character, intelligence and ability. Copyright Extended to Denmark. Upon proof thai the legislation of Denmark secures copyrignt to American citizens on tqual footu.g with its own, the privileges of our copyright laws have been extei.ded by procla mation to subjects of thai country. Financial tatemenc. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government lroin all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 18UJ amounted to i4til.71u.561.94an its expenditures to 4459,374,Bri.29. Tnere was collected from customs t,a 5,3io,JJti.73 and from internal rev enue *161.0^7,6:3.91. Our dutiable impor.s amounted to t4cl.8.5,7ll an increase of 5ac,4J, 907 over the preceding year, and importation.-, free of duty amounted to $444.541,211, a decrease from the preceding year of U3.4aa.447. internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preced ing year by H-7.l47.4i5 32. The total tax collected on distilled spirits was 394,720,260 55. on manufactured tobacco, ?3l 889.711.74. and on fermented liquor, 432,518.- 98o.o7. We exported merchandi-e during the year amounting to $847,605,194, a decrease of ttl82.612.954, from the preceding year. 'the amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year in the history of the government, amounting io il08.68J,844, and exceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by *68.185.517. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bouncy was ..9,375,130.88, an increase over ihe preceding year of -3-,ea.j,05a 05. Kstim ites. It is estimated upon the basis of present rev enue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 3d, 1891. will be w3J,- !21,3d5.28 and its expenditures v4)8,l*lJ5.38, re Bult.ng in a deficiency of 

,.I'8,IXX),0J Our Circulation. On the first day of November, less, th amount of money of all k'-nds in circulation, or not included In treasury holdings, was |l,718,51+,- 682, an increase for the year of i 11 .",4 4,917 Es timating our population at 67,426,MM at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was c2. 49. On the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to =.96,657,27J and silver bullion which was purchased at a cost of 4126.- 261.533. Silver Bullion Purchases. The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1830, during the lust fiscal year, aggregated 54,0o8,l02.59 tine ounces, which cost ti45.5ol,- 371.63. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that tax became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the 1st day of November, 18^3, was 1168.674- 690.48 fine ounces, which cost tl5o,930,- 040.84. Between the 1st day of March. 1873, and the 1st day of November, 13J3. tbe government purchased, under all laws, 6J3,- 0J3.717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of 516,622,- 948 The silver dollars that have beeu coined under the act of July 14, 18D0. number 36.087.285. Tbe seicrnioraee arising from such coinage was '6.977.098.39. leaving ou taud in the mints If 699,730 flue ounces of silver which.cost 41.6,758. Coinage Statistic s. Our total coinage of all metals during the last Bscal Vear consisted of 07.28J.875 pieces, valued st S43.685.178.8). it which there was $30.0:18.14) in gold coin. $5,343,715 in silver dollars. f7,217.220.W In subsidiary silver coins and $1,08.5, iu2 90 In minor coins During the calendar year 1892 ihe production of precious metals in the United States was estimated to be 1,596.375 flue ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage value of i.13.000,010 and SS.OUJ.OUO mine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $50,- 750,000 and of the coinage value of $74,989,900. It is estimated that on the 1st day of. July, 1893, the metallic stock of monoy in the United States, consisting of coin and.iullion, amounted to 11,213,659,169, of which $597,097,685 wa3 gold and t015.86l.484 was silver. New and Snspended Banks. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the vear ending October SI, 1893, with a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus pended. Sixty-live of the suspended banks were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business and seven remained in the hands of bank ex aminers, with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the new Can :s organized forty-four were located in the eastern states, forty-one west of .the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the central and southern states Ihe total number of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October. 1893. was 3,79rt. having an aggregate capital of 695.558.120 Net increase in the cir culation of these banks during the year was i36 88 5,972. Repeal of the Silver Purchasing Clanse. The recent repeal of the provisions of law requiring the purchase of silver bullion bv the governmeni as a feature of our monetary scheme has made an entire change in the com plexion of our currency affairs I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching In the nature of things, however, it is impossible to know at tbis time precisely what conditions wilt be brought about by the change, or what, if any. supplementary legislation may, in the light of such conditions, appear to be essential or ex pedient. Confident of the Future. Of course, after ihe recent financial perturba tion, time is necessary for the reestablishtnent of business confidence. When. hoVever, through this restored confidence the money which has been frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every require ment of our inc.easing population and busi ness. I tbe pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, determined to be con tent with nothing less than a lasting and com prehensive financial plan. In these circum stances I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of being in jurious, will increase ihe probability of wise action. The Monetary Conference. Tbe monetary conference iich assembled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to the 30th day of Novemoer in the present year. The considerations just stated and ihe fact that a definite proposition from us seemed to bee pected upon the eiissemoiing of the conference led me to express a willingness to have the meeting still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authori ty to the president to invite other nations to such a conference at anv time when there should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an international agreement on tbe subject of coinage. Recommendation Regarding Bonds. I desire also to earnestly suggest tbe wisdom of amending tne existing statutes in regard i the issuance of government bonds. Th a thority now vested in the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds is not as clear as it should be, and the bonds autborized are disad vantageous to the governmeni both as to the time of their maturity and rate of interest. Immigration Statistic s. The superintendent of immigration, through tbe secretary of the treasury, reports that dur ing the last UBcal year there arrived at our ports 44^,793 immigrauis. Of these l,v03 were not permitted to land under the limitations of tbe law, and 577 were returned to the countries from whence tbey came, by reason of their hav ing become public charges The total arrivals were 141,034 less than for the previous year. Prevention of Disease. The secretary in his report gives an account of tne operation of the marine uosp tal service and of the good work done under its aupervision in preventing the eirrrauve and spread of con tagious diseases. The admonitions of the iast two years touching our public heaith and the demonstrated danger or the introduction of contagious diseases irom foreign ports has invested tne subject of national quarantine with increased interest A more general aud har monious system than now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere, and con stantly operating by preventive nieaus to shield our counuy from the invasion 0*disease, and at the same time havmg oue regard to tne rights and duties of local agencies, would, I be lieve, add greatly to the safety of our people. the War lep*rtuiut The secretary of war reports that tbe strength of the artnv on the Joih day of Sep tember last was 25,778 enlisted men and 2,144 officers. The total expenditure of tbe depart ment for tbe year ending June 30, 1893, amount ed to 951,906,074.91 Of this sum, 1,992,581.95 was for salaries und contingent expenses c23,- 377,828 33 for ihe support or the military estab lishment to.077,033.18 for miscellaneous ob jects, and $20,618,631.41 for public works. This latter sum includes *ld,29u,87o 46 for river aud harbor improvements and 0 for forti fications aud other works of defense. The National Guard. The total enrollment of tbe militia of the several states was on the 8ist of October of the current year 112,597 officers and enlisted men The officers or the army detailed for the in spection aud instruction of this reserve of our military force report tnat increased interest and maraed progress are in dis- cipllne and yuJ&tsxM theapparent tagitBiwttoatb-e Peine Has RefguedT Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic vio lence n=ive called the army into service during the year, aud the only active military duty re quired Kit it has beeu iu the depar tuieu i of 'texus, wuc-re violations of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were proniut.y and efficiently dealt with by the troops, eliciting the warm approval of ibe civil and military au thorities of both countries. Reorganize the Army. The operation of w,se laws and the Influences of civilization constantly tending to relieve tne couuify from the dangers of Indian hostilities, together with the increasing ability of the stales, through the efficiency of the na tional guard organizations, to protect ineir citizens from domestic violence, lead to the suggest.on that the time is fast approaching when there should be a reorgauizalion of our army on the lines of the present necessit.es of the country. This change contemplates neither iuurease number nor added expense, but a redistribution of me lorce and an encouragement of measures tend ing to greater efficiency among the men and im provement of the service. Th adoption of battalion formations for Infantry regiments, ihe strengthening of the artillery force, the abandonment of smaller and unnecessary posts, and the massing of the troops a impor tant and accessible stations, all promise to pro mote the usefulness of ine army, in the judg ment of army officers, with out few exceptions, tne operation of the law forbidding tbe reeu listiuent of men after ten years service has not proved its wisdom, aud while the arguments mat led to its adoption were not without- merit the experience of years constrains me to join in the recommendation for its repeal. Progress in Coast leleuse It is gratifying to note that we have begun to attain completed results in the comprehen sive scheme of seacousi defense and loruficu iiou. entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been already expended, but the cost of maintenance will be incon siderable as compared with the expense of construction and ordnance. A the end of the current calendar year the war depart ment will have nine 12-inch, twenty lu-inch and thiny-four8-iuchguns, ready i he mpunted on gun lifts and carriages, aim venty-iivc 12- juch mortars, i addition to tbe product of the army gun factory, now completed at Wa icrvliet, the government has coniracted with private parlies for the purchase) of one hundred guns of these cali bers, the first of which Should be delivered to the department tor test before July 1, 1894. 'the manufacture of heavy ord uauce keeps pace wiih current needs, but to render Ihesu guns available for tbe purposes they are designed io meet, emplacements must be prepared for them. Progress has been made iu this direcliou, and it is desirable that con gress by- adequate appropriations should pro vide for the uninterrupted prosecution of this necessary work. Mew Rifle for the Army. After much preliminary wor. and exhaustive examination in accordance with the require ments of the law. the board appointed \o seiect a magazine rifle of modern type, With which to replace tne obsolete Springfield rifle, of the in fantry service, completed its labors during the last year, und the work of manufacture is now in progress at the national armory at Spring held. I is confidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supplied with a weapon equal to that of the nost progressive armies of ihe world. Nation al Military Park. The work on the projected Chlckamauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with 2e.1l and judg ment, and its opening will be cele brated dur ng the coming year. Over nine wniare mi-es of the Chick in mtri f'ln'd hare been acquired, twenty-five miles of road* way have been constructed and permanent tab lets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to tbe states to mark the positions of their troops participating in the battle has been very generally accepted Th work of locating and preserving tbe lines of battle at the Gettysburg battlefield Is making satisfactory progress on the plans directed by lue last congress. The Milita ry Schools, The reports of the Military academy at Weal Po.nt and the several sehoils for special in structions of officers show marked advance i a education of the ai mv and a commendable am biiion among is officers to excel in the mili tary profession and to fit themselves for the highest service to the country. Under the supervision of Adjt. Gen Robert Williams, lately retired, the bureau of military information has become well established and is performing a service that will put in possession of the government in time of war most valuable information aud at all times serve a purpose of great utility in keeping the army advised of the world's progress in all matters pertaining to the art of war. The .Judiciary Department. The report of the attorney general contains the usual summary ot*.he affairs and proceedings of the department, of justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects. I can not too heartily itidorse the proposition that the fee system as applicable to the compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United S&tes commis sioners, should be abolished wiih as little de lay as possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of the courts, both civil and oriminal. shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted as the ends of just ce will allow. Th system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes the compensation of court officials de pend upon the volume of such business, and thus creates a conflict between a proper execu tion of the law and private gain, which cannot fail to be dangerous to the rights and free dom of citizens and irrisistible temp tation to the unjustifiable expenditure of public funds. If in addition to this re form another was inaugurated which would give to the United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offenses within the grade of misdemeanors, especially those coming under the internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a more decent administration of the criminal law. In ray first, message to congress, dated De cember 8. 1885, I strongly recommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the evils of the present system. Since ihat time the criminal business of the federal courts and the expense attending it have enormously increased. The number of criminal prosecu tions pending in the circuit and district Courts of the Uuited Stales on the 1st day of July, 1885, was 3.8J8, of which 1,844 were for vio lations of the internal revenue laws, while the number of such prosecutions pending on the 1st day of July, 1893, was 9,- 01, of which 4,20J were for violation of ihe internal revenue laws. The expense of the United States courts, exclusive of judges' salaries, for the year ending July 1 1885, was 82.874,733 11 and for ihe year ending July 1, 1893, 44.528,076 87. I is. there-, fore, apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the federal criminal law have gained cogency and gained Btrength in lapse of ume. Indorses the Attorney General. I also heartily join the attorney general in recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within federal jurisdiction, as has been done in many of the slates ..thoriz- ing writs of errors in behalf of the government In cases where final judgment is rendered against the stiffl ieiuy of an in dictment or against the govemme rt upon any other question arising before aeiual trial limiting the right of review in cases of felony pu ustiable only by fine and im prisonmeni to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy provision for the Construction of su'-h prisons and reformatories as may necessary for tne confinement of Uuited States convicts. Postal Affairs. The report of the postmaster general con talus a detailed statement of the operations of the post office department during the last fiscal year and much interesting informaiion touch ing this important branch of the public service. Th business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the con dition of the business of the country, aud depression in financial affairs inevitably aud quickly- reduces tbe postal revenues. Therefore a larger discrepancy tnau usual be tween the post office re. e.pis and expenditures is the expected and unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during mucu of the timo covered by the postmaster general's re ports Enormous Deficiency^ At a date when belter times were anticipated It was estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency ou the 30th day of June, 189.1, would be but a little over il,500,)0 I amounted, however, 10 more than 5,U00,000 A the same time, and under the influence of' like anticipa tions, estimates were made for the current tot'-al year ending June 3J. 1894. which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of i.872,- 245 71 but now. in ,'iew of tne actual receipts und expenditures during that part of the cur rent ilscai year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that at iis ciose instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency of nearly I8.000.00J. The post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to 75.896 93J. 16, and Its expenditures to t81.074.004.9J. Tnis post office deficiency would disappear or be immensely deoreased if less matter was carried free through the mails, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. Tbe total number of post offices in the United States on tbe 30th day of June, 1893. was 68,- 403, an increase of 1,284 over tbe preceding year. Of these 3,360 were presidential, an in crease in that class of 204 over the preceding year. The Free Delivery System. Forty-two Tree delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, mak ing a total of 610 cities and towns provided with free delivery on June 30. 1893. Ninety three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service under the law, but it has noting been accorded them on acoount of in sufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. I am decidedly of the opinion that tbe provisions of the present law permit as general an introduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary or justi fiable, and that it not be extended to smaller communities than are now designated. Thj expense of free delivery for the fiscal year end ing June 30. 18J4. will be more than $11,000,000, aud under legislation now existing there must be a constant increase in this item of expendi ture Money Ord er Business. There were 6,401 additions to the domestio money order offices during the last fiscal year, being the largest increase in any year since the inauguration of the sytem. Th total number of these offices at the close of the year was 18,434. There were 13,309,745 money orders is sued from these offices, being an increase over the preceding year ot 1,210,293 and the value of these orders amounted to $127,576,- 433.65, an increase of 47,600,632.58. There were also issued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,903,076.73. During tbe year 195 International money-order offices were added to those already provided, making a to tal of 8.407 in operation on June 30, 1893.If Ihe number of international money orders is sued during the year was 1,055.990, an increase over the preceding year of 72,625, and their value was 416,341,837.36, an increase of 11,221,- 606.31. The number of orders paid was 3oo,9i7, an increase over tbe preceding year of 13.5J3, and their value was $5,2^3,375.70 an increase of 194.094.83. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders nnd postal notes for the year amounted to 1156.821.348.24. -The number of letters nd package maiir-n during tbe yeaffoTspeeiar aeirvery was a 375T- 693, an increase over the preceding year of nearly 22 per cent The special delivery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to ,.337,569 30, and the messengers' fees paid lor their delivery amounted to .256.592.71, leaving a profit of ,.80,076 59. Tue Railway Service. The railway mail service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all offls.es, but It Is the especial instrumentality winch puts tbe smaller and way places in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal offices, lhls branch of the postal service has'therefore received much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it is gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness. I am led to agree with the postmaster general, that there is room for its further improvement. Value of Civil Service Reform. There are now connected with the post office establishment 28,3:4 employes who are in the classified servica Th head *of this gre it de partment gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil service reform when, after an ex perience that renders bis judgment on the sub ject absolutely reliaole, be expresses the opinion that without the benefit of this system It would be impossible to conduct the vast busi ness intrusted to him. 1 desire io commend as especially worthy of prompt attention tn suggestions of the postmaster general relating-to a more sensible und business-like organization and a better dis tribution of responsibility in his department Ihe Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy con tains a history of the operations of his depart ment during the past year, and exhibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. Ho present3 a satisfactory account of lb^ progress wiiicli has been lp in i-ni structlon of vessels and makes a number i recommendations to which attention is espe cially Invited. Cruisers Kept Busy. During tbe past six months the demands for eruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions calling for vessels to protect American interests in Nioaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Argentina and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. With all these oil is upon our navy, it became necessary, in order to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Behring sea un der the modus Vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that service one vessel from tbe fish commission and three from the revenue n, irina Progress in the construction of new vessels has not been as rapid as was anticipated. There has been delay in the completion of un armored vessels, but for t most part they have been such as are constantly occurring even in countries having the largest experience In naval ship building. Tb most serious de lays, however, have been in the work upon armored ships The trouble has been the fail ure of contractors to*deliver armor as agreed. The difficulties seem now, however, to Have been all overcome, and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. Our Reorganized Navy. A a result of the experience acquired by ship builders and designers and material men, tt Is believed that the aates when vessels will be completed can now be estimated with rea sonable aocuracy Great gu is. rapid fire guns, torpedoes and powder are being promptly sup plied. The following vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready foi service: The double-turreted coast-defense monitor Miantonomoh, the double-turreted coast-de fense monitor Monterey-, the armored cruiser New York, the prote-cte I cruisers Baltimorei Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, San Francisco, Charleston, Atlanta and Boston, the cruisei Detroit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington, Machias, Castine and Petrel, th dispatch vessel Do.phin, the practice vessel Bancroft and the dynamite gunboat Vesuvius, Of these the Bancrof Machias, Detroit and Castine have been placed in commission during the current calendar year. The following vessels are in progress of con struction: The second-c'ass battleship Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marblehead, und the coast-defense monitors Terror. Puritan. Ampbitriie and Monadnock. all of which will be completed withiu one year the harbor defense Ram Katahdin and the pro tected cruisers Columbia.Minneapolis.Olympia, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will oe completed prior to July 1, 18J5. the ttrst-clasa battleships Iowa. Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, whtth will be completed oy February 1, 1893. and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed by August 1. of that year. I is also expected that the three gun boats authorized oy the last congress will be completed iu less than two years. A Note of Warning. Since 1883 congress has at each session authorized tne building of one or more vessels, and the secretary of the navy presents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. recommends the author! zution of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While 1 am dis tinctly In favor of consistently pursuing tha policy we have inaugurated of building up a thorough and efficient navy I cannot refrain from tne suggestion that the congress should caroruily take into account the number of un finished vessels ou our hands aud the depleted condition of our treasury in considering the propriety of an appropriation at this time to begin new w^rk. The method of employing mechanical labor at navy yards through boards of labor, and making efficiency the sole lest by which labor ers are employed and continued, is produc ing the best results, and the secretary is earnestly devoting himself to its development Attention is Invited to ihe statements of his report in regard to the workings of the system. The Pension Rolls. The secretary of the interior has the super vis.ou of so many important subjects that iiis report is of especial value and in teres On the 3uiii day of June. 1893, there were on the pen sion rolls 960,012 names, an increase of 89,941 over the number on the rolls June 3d, 189:. 01 these there were 167 widows and daughters ot revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5.425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,- 518 survivors aud widows of the Mexican war, 3,332 survivors and widows of Indian wars. 281 army nurses and 47J.645 survivors and widows aud children of deceased soldiers aud sailors oi the war of the rebellion Th latter number represents those pensioned on account of disa bilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1893, who were pensioned un der the act of June 27 1890, which allows pen sions on account of death and disability not chargeable to army service, was 459,155. The number added to the rolls during the year was i?3,634 and the number dropped was 1)3,690. The first payments on pensions a lowed during the year amounted to $33,7c4- 549.98. This includes arrears, or the accumu lation between the lime from which the al lowance of pension dates and the time of actual ly granting the certificate. Pensions for Disabilities. Although the law of 189J permits pensions fot disabilities not related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist incapacitating applicants "from the per formance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support" 'the execution of this law in its early stages doea not seem to have been in accord with its true intention but toward tne close of the last administration an authoritative construction was given to the statute and since that lime this construction nas been' followed. This iias had the effect ol lmiling the operation of tbe law to its intended purpose The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pens.ons which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com plete examination, giv.ng notice to the pension ers in order that tbey might have an opportun ity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity Frauds li ul .Exposed. This, 1 understand, is tbe practice which has for a long time prevailed in tbe pension bureau, but after entering upon these recent investigations the comm.ssioner modified ims rule so as not to allow, uutu utter complete ex amination, interference with the payment of a pensiou apparently not altogether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than authorized by law. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudu lently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposi tion upon the kindly sentiment in which pen sions have their origin Every iraudulent pen sioner has become a bad citizen every faise oath in support of a pension has made perjury more common, und false and undeserving pen. sioners rob the people not om ot tneir money but Of the patr.otic sentiment wnich the survivors of war, fought for the pre.- ervation of the un on. ought to in spire Thousands of neigh hot ho jds have their well-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appall ing conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, wno certainly ought not to be condemned to such association, lhose who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be accused of enmity or in difference to the claims ot honest vettrans. Enormous Expenditures. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 3 J, 1893, was $156,740.467.14. The commissioner estimates that 

UOJ.OJO.OOJ will be required to pay pensions during tbe year ending June 30, 1891 Indian Affairs. The condition of the Indians and their ulti ma te fate are subjects which are related to a sacred duty of the government and which strongly appeal to the sense of justice and the sympathy of our people. Our Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 161 reservations, contain- 86,116,531 acres of land. About lU.OOO of these Indians have, to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in severalty have been allotted to many of them. Such allott ments have been made to lO.OOu individuals dur ing tbe last fiscal year, embracing about 1000,000 ceres. Th number of Indian gov ernment schools open during the year was 195, an increase of twelve over the preceding year. Of this total 170 were on reservations, of which seventy-three were boarding schools and ninety-seven wore day schools. Twenty board ing schools and five day schools supported by tbe government were not located ou reserva tions. Tbe total number of Indian children en rolled during the year as attendants of all schools was 21,138, un increase of 1,231 over the enrollment for the previous year. What I Best for the Indian. I am sure that secular eduoation and moral and religious teaching must be important fac tors in an effort to save the Indian and lead him to civilization. I believe, too, that the relin quishment of tribal relations and the holding of land in severalty may, in favorable conditions, aid this consummation It stems to me, how ever, tbat allotment of land in severalty ought to be made with great care and circumspection. hastily done before the Indian knows its mean ing, while yet he has little or no idea of tilling a farm and no conception of thrift, there is great danger that a reservation life in tribal relattons may be exchanged for the pauperism of civilization, instead of its independence and elevation Tbe solution of the Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration Tne personal fitness of agents and their adapt ability to the peonliar duty of earing for their wards are of the utmost Importance. Danger or Abases.' The law providing that, except In especial eases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian agents, it is boped will prove a successful experiment. There Is danger of great abuses creeping into the prosecution of claims for Indian depredations, and I recommend that every possible safeguard be provided against the enforcement of unjust and fictitious claims of this description Th appropriations on account of the Indian bureau for the vear ending June 3), 1894, amount to 87,954,962 99 a decrease as compared with the year preceding Private Control of Public Lands. The vast area of land which, but a short time ago, constituted the public domain is rapidly falling into private hands. I is certain that in the transfer the beneficent intention of the gov ernment to supply from its domain homes to the industrious and worthy homeseekers is often frustrated. Though the speculator, who stands with extortionate purpose between the land office and those who, with their families are invited by the government to settle on the public lands, is a despicable character who ought not to be tolerated, yet It is difficult to thwart his schemes. Opening: of the Strip. The recent opening to settlement of the lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an area of 6.5)0,00 acres, notwithstanding the ut most care in framing the regulations governing the selection of locations and notwithstanding the presence ot United States troops, fur nished an exhibition, though perhaps in a mod ified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence and the fraudulent occupation which have ac companied previous openings of nublio land. I concur with the secretary in the belief that these outrageous lnoidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and I hope his recom mendations in that direction will be favorably considered. Frenerve the Forests. I especially commend to the attention of the congress the statements contained in the secre tary's report concerning forestry. Th time has come when efficient measures should taken for the preservation of our forests rrom Indiscriminate and remorseless destruc tion Th report of the secretary of agriculture will be found exceedingly in teresting, especially to that large part of our citizens intimately concerned in asri eultural occupations. On the 7th ot March, 1893. there were upon its payrolls 2.4 0 employes. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demand of the people for economy in the administration of their government, me secretary has entered upon the task ot rational ly reducing expenditures by the elimination from the payrolls of all persons not needed tor an efficient conduct of the affairs of the depart ment cutting Down Expenses. During the first quarter of the present year tbe exjenses of the department aggregated $345,876.76, as against 8402 012.42 for the corre sponding period of the fiscal year ending June i0, 1893. The secretary makes apparent his in tention to continue this rate of reduction by submittmsr estimates for the next fiscal year less by S994.280 than those for the present vear. Among the heads of divisions in this depart ment the changes have beeu exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and res ignations have been filled by the promotion of issistants in the same divisions. These promo- ,-ious of experienced and faithful assistants have tot only been in the interest of official *ork, but have suggested to tnose in the de partment who look for retention and promo tion that merit and devotion to duty are their best reliance. The amount appropriated for the bureau of animal industry for the current fiscal year is t8' 000 the estimate for the ensuing year is 4700,000. Contagious Diseases of Animals. The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during the last year, and th-j largest stock yards of the country have been kept free from infection Occasional local outbreaks have beeu largely such as could have been effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected caitle. While con tagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than pleuro-pneumonia. is still prevalent In vestigations have been made during the past year as to the means of its communication and the method of its correot diagnosis. Mdch progress has been made in this direction by the studies of the division of animal pathology, but work ought to be extended in cooperation with local authorities until the danger to hu man life arising from this cause is reduced to a minimum. The number of animals arrived from Canada during the year and inspected by bureau offi cers was 462.092, and the number fr trans Atlantic countries was 1,297. N ontigiou diseases were found among the ret ortei uni mals. The total number of inspect* ons of cat tle for export during the past fiscal yea? was 611.542. Falling: Oft In Export s. The exnorts show a falling oft of about 25 per cent, from the preceding year, the decrease oc curring entirely in the lust half or the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely duo to an increase in the price of American export cattle. During the year end ing June 30. 1803. exports of inspected pork ag gregated 20,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152.874 pounds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to in- spAeted pork, the total quantity exnnrted in 1892 being 665.490,016 pounds, while in 1893 it was only 527,3J5.69 pounds. I join the secretary in recommending that hereafter each applicant for the position of in spector or assistant inspector in the bu reau of animal industry be required, as a condition precedent to his appointment, to exhibit to the United States civil serv ice commission his diploma from an established, regular and reputable veterinary college, and that this bo supplemented by such an examina tion in veterinary science as the commission may prescribe. Exports of Agricultural Products. The exports of agricultural products from the United Stales for the fiscal year ending June 3. 1892, attained the enormous figure of 1800,000,000, in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. I the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but nevertheless reached $615,000,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special reference to their destination will show that iu almost every line the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for the fiscal vear ending June 30, 1893, 826.000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over 825,000,000. beef products of all kinds our total exports were $28,000,000, of which Great Britain took {24,000,- ooo Of pork produeds the total exports were 884,- OOO.OlK), of which Great Britain took {"fig000,000. In breads tuffs, cotton and minor products iike proportions sent to the same destination are Bhown Service of Great Valu e. The work of the statistical division of the de partment of agriculture deals with all that re lates io the economies of farming. The main purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the farmers informed as fully as possible of all matters having any influence upon the world's markets, in which the products find sale. It publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. I is there fore of profound Importance and vital concern to the farmers of the Unitod States, who rep resent nearly one-half of our population, and also of direct interest to tbe whole country that the work of this division be efficiently performed and that tbe lnformanion it has gathered be promptly diffused. It is a matter of congratulation to know that the secretary will not spare any effort to make this part of his work thoroughly useful In the year 1838 the congress appropriated $1,0)0 io be ta-.en from the patent office funds for the pur pose of collecting and distributing rare and im proved varieties of seeds and for prosecuting agricultural investigations and procuring agri cultural statistics. From this small beginning the seed vis on of the department of agricul ture has grown to its present unwieldy and un justifiably extravagant proportions. Dnring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was 566,548 61. The remainder of an appropriation of $13.00 was expended In put ting them un and distributing them. I surely never could havn entered the minds of those who first sanctioned appropriations of public money for the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds for gratuit ous distribution that from tbis would grow large appropriations for the purpose of distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings, which are common in all the states and territories and everywhere easily obtained at low prices. Wasteful Distribution of Seeds. In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are tne proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds and yet this indis criminate and wasteful distribution of legisla tion and legislators continues, answering no purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. Under tbe sanction of existing legislation, there was sent out from the agricultural depart ment during the last fiscal year enough of cab bage seed to plant 19,200 acres of land, a suffi cient quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2.500 acres, sweet corn enough to plant7.800 -lores, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,205 aores with vines, and enoueh muskmelon and watermelon seeds to nlant.2,675 acres. The total quantity of fiowei aud vegetable seeds thus distributed was con tained in more than 9,000,000 packages and they were sufficient, if planted, to cover 89,596 acres of land. Should Abolished. In view of these facts this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolisbed. Anticipating a consum mation so manifestly in the interests of good administration more than 8100,000 has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30, 1895, and the secretary recommends 'that the remaining $35,000 of the esti ate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds, and tbat these he distributed throughout experiment sta tions. Thus the seed will be tested, and after the test bas been completed by the experiment stations, the propagation ot tbe useful varieties and the rejection of the valueless may safely be left to the common sense of the people. Workings of the Civil Service Law. The continued intelligent execution of the civ 1 service law and the increasing approval of the people of its operation are most gratifying. Tne recent extension of its limitations and regulations to the employes at free de livery post offices, which has been hon estly and promptly accomplished by the commission, with the hearty cooperation of the postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system I am, If possible, more than ever convinced of the in calculable benefits conferred by the civil serv ice law, not only in its effect upon the publio service, but also, what is even more important, in its effect in elevating the tone ot political life generally. Popular Love of Bight and Jostles. The course of civil service reform in this country instructively and uterestingly illus trates how strong a bold a movement gains upon our people which has underlying It a sen timent of justice and right, and which at the same time promises better administration of limit cavernmejiav The law embodying this" reform found Its "way to* off? statute book more from fear of tha popular sentiment existing in Its favor than from any love for the reform Itself on the part of legislators: and it has live 1 and grown and flourished In spite of ihe covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and not withstanding the querulous impracticability of many self-constituted guardians. Beneath ail the vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it there underlies this reform a sturdy common-sense principle not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our peopie are more and more recognizing to bo absolutely essential to the most successful op eration of their government, if not to its per petuity. A Inconsistency Pointed Gut. It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the charaoter of thit reform, as well as with best enforcement, to oblige the com-' mission to rely for clerical assistance upon clerks detailed from other departments. There ought not to be such a condition in any depart ment tbat clerks hired to do the work there can be spared to habitually work at another place and it dees not accord with a sensible view of civil service reform that persons sho'ald be employed on the theory that their labor is necessary in one department when in point of fact their services are devoted to en tirely different work in another department I earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the commission be regu larl put upon its roster, and that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other depart ments be discontinued. This ought not to in crease the expense to the government, while it would certainly be more consistent and add greatly to the efficiency of tbe commission. Economy I Urged. Economy In public expenditure is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those Intrusted with ihe control of money drawn from tbe people for pub ic uses, must bo confessed tnat our apparently endless re sources, tbe familiarity of our people wiih im mense accumulations of wealth, ihe growing sentiment among them that the expenditures of pubiio money should in some manner be to tneir immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost steaithy manner in which a. large part of our taxes are exacted, and a de generated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance in governmental appropriations. A this time, when a depleted public treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries or life and when enforced cconoin via pressing upon the great mass of our country men, desire to urge, with all the earnestness at my command, that congressional legislation be so limited by strict economy as to exnibit an appreciation of the condition of tbe treasury and a sympathy with the strained circum stances of our fellow citizens. Th ty of public economy is also of immense importance in its intimate and necessary relation to the tusk now in hand of providing revenue to meet zovernment expenditures and yet reducing the people's buraen of federal taxation. Tariff Reform ore Us. After a hard struggle tariff reiorm is directly before us. Nothing so important claims our at tention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both un opportunity and a dutyan oppor tunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow sitizns and a dutv imposed upon us by our oft repeated professions and by the emphatic man date of the people. After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this re form, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to i For Revenue Only. If there is anything in the theory of a repre sentation in public places of the people and their desires, ir public officers are really the servants of the people, and if political promises and professions have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our efforts until this reform is ac omplisued by wise and careful legislation While we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have grown up among us which in Justice and fairness call for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually de mand. Reduction Mu st Substantial. Manifestly, if we arc to aid the people direct* ly through ianff reform, one of its most obvi ous features should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life Th benefits of such a reduction would be palpa ble and substantial, seei and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the will ing benefactions of a government whose high est function is the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people's pros perity and well-being is the removal of restric tions upon the importation of the raw materi als necessary to our manufactures Th world should be open to our national ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot be while federal legis lation, through the imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manufactures as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement .of the price of our manufactured products resuliing from this policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders,to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to out citizens. Labor's Interests Involved. The interests of labor are certainly though Indirectly involved in this feature of our tariff svstem Th sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress in the homes of our WOrkingmeu. Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence of our workingmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady employment, permitted by free raw ma terials, is the most important factor in their re lation to tariff legislation. The New Measure. A measure has been prepared by the appro priate congressional committee embodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legisla tive action. I is the result of much patriotio and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subjects consistently und thor oughly as existing conditions P"rmit I urn satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed legislation added to existing internal revenue taxation will in the near future, though perhaps not im mediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government The committee, after full consideration, and to provide against a temporary deficiency which may exist before tbe business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedules, have wisely embraoed in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a ill tax "upon incomes de rived from certain corporate investments Will Not Disturb liusiness. These new assessments are not only abso lutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted withou .unfavorable business disturbance when ever the necessity of. their imposition no longer exists. Must Subordinate Personal Desires. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only be attained by means of unselfish eoun-tel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a result of their willingness to subordinate pergonal desires and ambitirns to tbe tnerai goo 1 The local interests affecteu by the i ro losed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all ari insisted upon tbe legisla tion embodying the reform must inevitably fail. Conclusion. In conclusion, my Intense feeling of respon sibility im- ue to invoke tor'i m-in'fold Interests a generous and mfld.n* people the m'-st-cr puiuus care aud to pledge my willing support to every legislative ^ffort for the ad vancement of the greatness'and prosperity of our beloved country. 

GBOVER CLEVELAND. Executive Mansion, Washington, December 4, 1393. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. The Lawyer's Excellent Reasons for Re fusing the Cloth. An individual accused of stealing some cloth from a tailor's shop con vinced a lawyer sc thoroughly of his innocence that he undertook his de fense without the customary retainer and obtained an acquittal. The follow ing day his client came to the lawyer's office and said: "1 can't bear to owe anyone, so I have called to settle your fee, though I haven't any money." "Don't speak of that, my friend," said the lawyer, in a gush of gener osity. "The triumph of the truth and the clearing of an innocent man is suf ficient recompense for my labor." "Not at all," returned the client. "Every man to his business, and in de fault of mouey here is a very handsome piece of cloth" "Some cloth!" interrupted the advo cate, in surprise. "Certainly! This is the cloth that would have put me behind the bars if it hadn't been for you. There is enough for two complete suits. Let's divide. Is it a go?" The lawyer refused it with scorn. The cloth wasn't good enough for him. Besides that, when he came to measure it carefully, there wasn't enough of it Texas Sittings. Fast Recognition. Two young men of this city, sales men in a dry goods store, hired bicycles and took a spin into the country. When they were perhaps ten miles out they decided to have a race. One of them got far ahead of the oth er, and in dashing round a turn ran into a pile of stones. The wheel was demolished, and the rider found him self lying among the spokes. An aged woman who happened to be passing was met by the second rider. "My good woman," said he, "have you seen a young man riding a bicycle on ahead?" "No," said the woman "but I saw a young man up the road a spell ago who was sittin' on the ground mendin' um brellas."Louisville Courier-Journal. THE HIGHEST AWARD. Royal Baking Powder Has Ail the Honor* In Btrength and Value 2 0 Per Cent Above Its Nearest Competitor. The Royal Baking' Powder has the enviable record of having received the highest award for articles of its class greatest strength, purest ingredients, most perfectly combinedwherever ex hibited in competition with others. In the exhibitions of former years, at the Centennial, at Paris, Vienna and at the various State and Industrial fairs, where it has been exhibited, judges have invariably awarded the Royal Baking Powder the highest honors. At the recent World's Pair the exami nations for the baking powder awards were made by the experts of the chemi cal division of the Agricultural Depart ment at Washington. The official report of tKe tests of the baking powders, which was made by this Department of the specific purpose of ascertaining which was the best, and which has been made public, shows the leavening strength Of the Royal to be 160 cubic inches of carbonic gas per ounce of pow der. Of the cream of tartar baking pow ders exhibited, the next highest in strength, thus tested, contained but 183 cubic inches of leavening gas. The other powders gave an average of 111. The Royal, therefore, was found of 20 per cent, greater leavening strength than its nearest competitor, and 44 percent, above the average of all the other testa, Its superiority in other respects, how ever, in the quality of the food It makes as to fineness, delicacy and wholesome ness, could not be measured by figures. It is these high qualities, known and appreciated by the women of the coun try for so many years, that have caused the sales of the Royal Baking Powder, as shown by statistics, to exceed the sale of all other baking powders com bined. ACCORDING TO ENGLISH IDEAS. Fair Sample of Information Given About America. During the adjournment of congress President Cleveland and his wife retire each year to Buzzards bay, a truly ro mantic'seaport on the southern coast of the state of Massachusetts. This lovely place is positively sur rounded by localities of the deepest historical interest in the story of tha great republic over whose administra tion Mr. Cleveland presides. \tineyard Sound, where Ericssen and his hardy Norsemen first made their discovery of the western continent the beautiful Elizabeth islandsNew Bedford, Fairhaven, Rochester, the garden city of America, and Wareham are all in close propinquity to Buzzards bay. Here the Clevelands have a lovely home, where the president can indulge to his heart's content his hobbies of fishing in the spring and summer and duck shooting in the winter. Nor is Mrs. Cleveland far behind her distinguished husband in either of these sports. It is said that "Frankie," as she is familiarly called by her in timates, can cast a fly or bring down a duck with the same precision as can the president himself. The president and his family live very quietly when at their country quarters, and very few besides his par ticular cronies and her favored friends are able to find their way to the pretty househalf bungalow, half ranchin which they live. There can not be a much prettier pic ture of home life than that presented on a fine summer morning by President Cleveland seated I his old-fashioned, wicker-slatted rocking chair, with its high back and broad arms, reading the newspaper which has just come in from Boston, while a few feet away sits Mrs. Cleveland, in all the beauty of her buxom matronhood, playing with baby Ruth on the veranda that surrounds the houseFrom a London.Paper.
