" The cholera in Southern Franco and the eastern Spanish provinces haa opened n market for American flour Among the people who are just recovering from the oitoota of the plagno. IT was Chicago and not Ifoatrico that received the greatest attention from the Unilod States grand jury , and something like n score of Indictments will interest a number of Garden Oily speculators who tiled claima on land In North Nebraska under assumed names. But the state of Bcalrioo has not yet struck a clearing. CAMPAIGN scandals have scarcely ceased to plague the press of thin country before the flood gates of monarchial rottenness are opened. The Garmoyla and Cole ridge family skeletons are hardly out of eiaht , and in their train follown the rupture in the house of Argylo. The Marquis of Lorno and the 1'rincee * liouiso are out , and the courts will soon bo called upon to effect a legal sopara tiou. Ai.iutADY Grovcr Cleveland is boy'n ' ning to receive presonta. The Grat gift that was offered to him was n dog , which -was sent to him by express , but ho re fused to accept it , probably because It was a "yallor dog. " The Boston demo cratn now propose to present him with a carriage and team. Mr. Cleveland will very likely politely refuse It , if ho wishes to retain the rcepcct of the people , and maintain the dignity of the position to which ho has boon olovatod. Tup. authorities of Denver are to bo congratulated upon having driven from that city the notorious bunko man , Dr. Il4g ! > e , and his gang of confidence sharks. They are now temporarily in Omaha , and nay they are going to Now Orleans. Wo would suggest to Marshal Cumlngs that it would bo a good thine ; to order them to resume their journey to tho' Orescent City , as they might conclude to spend the winter hero. Several confidence gumos have boon played in and around Omaha during the past few days , and it is not unlikely that this gang ia doing the work. Tvrn.NTV thousand bushola of corn were sold at Hastings the ether day for eight cants a bnahol , aud in some parts of the elate the farmers are burning corn for fuul OB It la cheaper than coal. Corn at -eight and twelve cants a bushel ia not worth shipping. At those prices the /armor who ships a oar load of corn to Chicago will find himself in debt to the railroad , as the corn will not pay the freight. What wo need and must have is rcducod railroad rates , so that the farmer can have a show. Under the present exorbitant tariff ho has- Imply to work year in and year out for the railroads. There la indeed Aomothing radically wrong when railroad rates are BO high that the producer cannot , ahip his products to market. It is high time that the robbery of the producer should bo stopped , and if the next legis lature does neb take efleotivo stops to remedy thia evil it will bo diroloot in its duty to the people of Nebraska. The .local rates in Nebraska are bimply out rageous. The talk about the railroads voluntarily reducing their tariffs la all boeh , and oven if they did there certainly cun bo no harm In the legislature fixing maximum rates so that the roads could not raise then ? agaiu after having once jnido a reduction. 

CHARLES FIIAMOM ADAMS ia something - thing of a landgrabbor himself. It ap- oaro that ho and his associates have entered largo tracts of land In Wyo ming upon which they have expended $000,000 in irrigation , and they have aisignod the entries to ether parties to provo up. Thia action has raised quito an important question concerning 'tho dexert land entry law , and the Wyoming .cat'lemon'a association haa sent its at- 'tornoy to Washington to obtain from the .secretary of the interior a ruling on tbo matter. Carl Schurz , when secretary of 'tho interior , hold that an assignment of that kind , placing an entry In the hands of on assignee , violated the contract , BO that the entry could not bo proved up. This haa been generally understood to bo the pcmtion of the department over alnce. It is now intimated that Secretary Teller will reverse the decision of Schurz , BO that hereafter an aasignuo can provo up a desert land entry. Public lands which require irrigation to make them produce crops come under the cl&s- uiQcitlou of desert Undo. Adama and bis auciclatea will therefore acquire poa- of tbo lands in question. Secre tary Teller'a decision will no doubt be the cause of much of the eo-oallod desert lands of the west being entered , assigned and proved up , as good titles can bo ac quired through aseignoos. Among the first to take advantage of this decision of will bj tbo cattle men , TUG PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Arthur's message to congress Is an rible , dignified and practical state document , and will bo read with a great deal of intercit. All Important matters nro treated in a very intelligent manner , and it is evident that the president has given to the various subjcc's his closest attention nnd most careful study. Ills congratulations to the country upon iho patience nnd love of order nnd of law displayed by the paoplo while the prcii- dontlal Issue was In doubt are eminently proper and timely , and in this connection bo calls the attention of congress to the necessity of providing a moro satisfactory method of counting the electoral vote , Among the recommendations embodied in the moisago Is the extension of the icopo of the neutrality lawa , BO as to cover acts of hostilities committed in this country against a friendly power. This is evidently aimed at the dynamiters , and may not bo very warmly received by the enemies of England , oven If they do not endorse dynamite warfare. They will atguo that the Unltod States ought not to take any stops in ouch legislation for the benefit of England until England haa evinced some reciprocal spirit , and makes a request for mutual' legislation. The inference might bo that the United States has become the headquarters of conspirators against foreign government which is by co means the fact. The nearest approach to anything of that kind is O'Donovan lloasa and hisfewcsso olatoa , who simply amuse thorns 2ves by inventing scaroa that have no foundation in fact. The prraidont'a recommendation , coin' ciding with that of the secretary of the treasury , that the coinage of silver should bo immediately suspended , is based upon the fact that there is now in the treasury 5180,000,000 in nilvor , and only ? 10- 000,000 in circulation. To force thia overproduction of silver Into circulation ho recommends the mthdraual from circulation of thoouo nnd two dollar notes. Whether this proportion to unload the cumbersome oilvor Trill meet with popular approval remains to bo soon , as there cooma to bo an abund ance in circulation aud moro than enough for all practical purpoaoa of trade. As a rule people prefer smill bills OB they nro more convenient to handle , President Arthur dwells at considera ble length upon the subject of our foreign trade , and makes several recommenda tions as to the best methods , in lib opinion , to relieve the depression under which our industries are languishing. After tuggcsting that a commission bo appointed , .ho rocommonda n series of treaties with the countries of America so us to afford an opportunity for an un hampered movement of trado. Ho ad - vacates the free admission of such articles of mer chandise from these countries na nro not produced in the Unltod States , and that products from our country bo treated iti tlko manner by the treaty nations * also , the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United States , and the establishment of a consular service on n salaried footing , and the rollnqulshmont of consular fees not only as respects vessels under the national flag , but as respects the vessels of the treaty nations , carrying joods entitled to the benefits of the treaties. Another suggestion , which is very practical In Itn nature , is to establish a uniform currency basis for the a countries of America that might enter Into the proposed trade treaties , ao that the coin products of our mines may nlr- culato on equal terms throughout the entire - tire combination. This of course would have to bo brought about by n monetary union. The president urgoi the restora tion of the navy to its former efficiency , not only as a matter of national pride , but as a security against trouble- with foreign countries , which may. como at any time. In the Bamo connection ho recommends the de fense of our seaports by appropriate works , ana for that purpose ho suggests an appropriation , BO that operations can bo begun lit nn early day. The surplus in the treasury could not bo used for a bettor purpose. In rog rd to the voxittouu Morifnon problem , President Arthur expresses himself rather emphatically. IIo believes that if the polygamous practices cf thu Mormons can bo suppressed , it cm only bo done by the most radical legislation , consistent with the roatralnta of the con tlre stitution , and ho rooommonda that con- regress gross assume absolute political control ot Utah. cl BOd 

OPENING OF CONGRESS. d The national logliUturo resumes Its 0It session to-day. While thnro la an im It mense amount of work laid out for both 01 houses , it Booms to bo the prevailing im- Is"I prcsslon that but few of the many pond , "I ing bills will become hws during the present congress , the tendency being to postpone final legislation as much as to possible until after the inauguration of is Cleveland. In the senate there nro three hundred bills awaiting action , among the up most the The nt important being following : bill to "appropriate and expend 50,000- 000 , derived from the Internal revenue as taxes and sale of public lauds for the 31. education of all the children living in the United States ; " to repeal the timber culture act ; to establish a bureau of statistics of labor ; to provide moons for the suppression and extirpation of pleuro. pneumonia and ether contagious diseases among domoitio animals ; to provide for the Inspection of meats for exportation , and prohibiting the Importation of adulterated articles of food or drink ; to est establish a pmtal telegraph system ; lo give copyright to newspaper wrltori ; to prohibit the importation and migration foreigners and aliens under contract to perform labor in the United State * , aud that to IcgiliV.j the incorporation of ii.-toniU trade unicns. Then there are the bills Heeling the I'jc.fic railroadst T. o rcsilulUn proposing an cmcndmcnt , o Iho constitution making the presi dential term six years is alao on the cn'ondar. ' In the house there is also a host of > ills under consideration. The Mexican loncion bill , which has passed both iouacs , is being hold on amendments The bills relating to Iho forfeiture of cer tain land grants to railroads , the bill concerning - corning the presidential count and sue oonnion , and the bill authorizing .Iho con struction of n now 8300,000 building for the congrccslonal library are also among the special orders. Thoblll to extend the duration of the court of commissioners oi Alabama claims , to provide for the moro speedy delivery of letters at froo-dolivcry offices , and to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States , and the Utah bill , are among the other matters of importance. Thu wo last bills have already passed the sonatc , and it la very lively that they will receive early attention , especially that relating to bankruptcy , as thcro is a general de mand for 30ino uniform system in this matter , TUB.
