International Nm Ssrries tonight. He eontlmMd: -Tbmm proposals are lea than the Allies are entitled to unfer the treaty of Versailles. If e*feetl?e by acceptance they would mean further revi sion of the treaty of Versailles MATTER rOB EXPERTS. The conference win meef again tomorrow. If an agreement Is reached on generaj principles It may make the Brussels meeting unnecessary. If there la a gen eral agreement the rest would be *'l ? matter for the experts. I proposed to the premiers on Saturday an elaborate scheme reparations and lntcr *** debts. I pi onussd the In demnity be based on productive ?nd economic guarantees. My Proposals ?win again be "before the conference Monday. "The question of Intertilled debts owing to the United States **" not raised. It probably wffl not be raised for the time be in*. It is irrelevant." GERMAN PROPOSALS. The German proposals Included the following: 1?Germany will raise an In ternal loan of no specified sum. "it suggests 3.000.000.000 gold marks (nearly $750,000,000); 2?If permitted to raise such a ?um Germany wants a two-year moratorium, promllsng to turn half or the proceeds of ths loan to the Allies. The remainder would be used for stabilization of the mark and the exchange rates. J?For every 1.000.000,*00 marks above 3.000.000,000 Germany sug gests an additional year be added - to the indemnity moratorium, thus hoping to extend the mora torium into several years' dura tion. WANTED LOAN FREE. Chancellor Cuno. who sicned the proposals, suggested that ?ich con ditions would attract German capi tal that Is now leaving the coun try. He proposed that the loan be free of taxation. The only satisfaction the French got out cf the German proposals was that they specified no definite amount by which reparations would he redu< ed. If the Brussels conference Is held at all the French and Italians want It to open next Saturday. The Bel gians want it postponed until early In the new year. MAY INVITE I NITED STATES. The suggestion has been made that the I'nited States be invited to participate In all the negotiations ?t Brussels, but particularly those relating to Allied debts. The results of the premiers' meet hie here will be communicated to the Slate Department at Washing ton so that the Americans may know the details of any general pr.gram that may be drawn up. I 'nl.-ss the French upset all the calculations by rejecting all the Cennans proposed, it had been ex pected that an attempt would be n:.ide io solve the indemnity issue along the following lines: I'KOBAKI.E SOLUTION. 1. Germany would obtain an in demnity moratorium running from eighteen to twenty-four months. 2. Total German 'indemnity to be reduced to approximately $12. 000.009.000. of which the Germans slreadv have paid snout $2,000, 000,000. 3. By a German Internal rold loan and foreign credits a sum In excess of $1,000,000,000 would be ulsed with which to stabilize the German mark: balance the German budget, relieve distress, foster commerce and industry and to apply upon the financial obliga tions owed by Germany to other countries, chiefly France. 4 Great Britain would reduce ?nd in some instances virtually cancel debts owing to her by Ku pean Allied powers. ?CARANTEES ASKED. 5. New guarantees would he provided to compel German pay ments. but France would promise not to undertake any independent military action against Germany. S. The German* would demand written pledges that all the Ger man territory now occupied or oc cupied In the future by Allied troops shall be returned to abso lute German sovereignty as soon as the German government gives sufficient evidence that all debts *111 be met In full- Assurances on this issue were to be given by the Allies. Before the premiers met today for their third session, although there were still wide divergencies In ?Istvb, the program had been so sat lMactury thai belief prevailed that the meeting would end tomorrow. CAME FROM CT'NO. Premier Polncare first replied to the proposals made on Saturday by Premier Bonar Law. of England. and the latter In an address to his colleagues outlined suggestions that had been brought to London by Dr. Bergmann. The German embassy claimed that Dr. Bergmann was in London on personal business, but subse quently it was revealed that he had brought proposals from t'hancellor Wilhelm Cuno, setting f'?rth the economic policy of the new German government. The chief conflict in views among the premiers up to this afternoon had been over German guarantees snd the question of debt reduc tion. FRENCH VIEWPOINT. Poincare has already presented the French viewpoint. France be levea that there should be economic < ontrol over the Rhlneland (where virtually all of Germany's Industries sre located): occupation by French troops of the Ruhr (where nearly sll the German coal mines are lo cated!; supervision of German fi nances (If there is an International loan!: control of German state owned forests and a "customs bar rier" along the Rhine. France de nies. however, that she ? contem plates anything that could be char acterized as a "military measure" airainst Germany. Of all the i^u.upean statesmen ax (???mhled here the one who proved of greatest interest was Benito Musso lini. Mussolini has a Isrge store of common sense. He knows what hs wants and he knows what It Is that Ktirope needs and he employs direct ??lion methods of the black-shlrted Italian Fascist! to get results. Italians In London have made the flaridge Hotel th.-ir common gath ering ground since Friday night. Whenever Mussolini appears In public he gets an ovation. Although he Is accompanied by a Fascist! lxwiveuard he Is usually so busily engaged in vehement conversation fhat he forgets all about his guards end gets separated from them so that they have an anxious task to find him. Turks and Greeks in Aceord on Plan to Open Their Frontiers for Their Own Countrymen AMERICANS IN OPPOSITION Hellenic Populace of Constan ? tinople Forms Chief Difficulty in Proposition ' at Present v ' By JOHN HADLEY. btnUml News hnlw. LAUSANNE, Dec. 10.?DeUilt of Turkish capitulations, the Otto man debt, exchange of Turkiah and Gratk civilian populations, and guarantees to insure demilitarisa tion of the Turkish Straits were discussed by Near East peace con ference subcoramissions through out the day but it was admitted to night that little progress had been made owing to the continuous hag gling of the Turk*. 

EXCHANGE OF FAMILIES. One tact stood out: The Ameri can observer* are not coin* to be so successful In their protest against the exchange of helpless Greek and Turkiah families as they were in their demand tor freedom of pas sage through the Turkish Straits. Both the Turks and Greeks sup ported Dr. Frldtjob Nansen, chair man of the League of Nations' Re lief Commission, agreed among themselves that future bloodshed could be averted by exchanging the Greek imputation In Turkey for the * Turkish population in Greek territory. GIVEN REST OF MONTH. Whether this drastic ruling would be applied at once to the ISO,000 Greeks living in Constantinople is not yet settled. The Turkish Na tionalist government has extended until December SI the period dur ing which "all Greeks" In Turkey must leave the country. Ismet Pasha contended that this applied to the Greek residents of Constantinople, but business con siderations may prevail upon An gora to extend the time. The Near Kast peace conference will enter Its tourth week to morrow. While general agree ments have been reached upon Thrace and the future status of the Dardanelles. Rosphorus and Sea of Marmora, the details art still In chaotic state. 

PRESENT ST ATI'S. As the situation stood tonight the following issues have been considered with these results: Thrace?Turkey will get all of Thrace lying between the Black Sea and the Marltza River a* far north as Adrianople. It will be surrounded by a neutral zone and Bulgaria will get a corridor to De<Jeagatch which will be a free port. Turkish Straits?The Straits will he free to the passage of merchant commercc of the world and demilitarized Turkish gend armerie will be allowed to police the demilitarized zones. Frontiers?Aside from Thrace they have not yet been settled. Mosul with its rich oil fields and the right of Turkey to dis pose of all Mosul rights come under this head. 

WANTS DEBT SPIJT. Ottoman Debt?Turkey claims that the debts should be split among the territories that were formerly a part of the old Otto man Empire. This would Impose part of the financial burden upon Greece, Jugo-Slavta, Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Irak, all of which took territory from Turkey In the past twelve years. Turkey will get no Indemnity from Greece. Capitulations?Turks are op posed to capitulations In any form. Exchange of Civil Populations? An agreement Is near on thfs is sue owing to the similarity of Greek and Turkish viewpoints. TURKS MAKE STAND. Military and Naval Matters? Turkey demands the right to maintain an army and navy of unlimited size on account ef the dangers of her geographical posi tion. She demands the right to fortify Constantinople, maintain a naval base there and also an arsenal. There Is much dispute as to the limitations of warships passing through the Straits Into the Black Sea. The Turks want these war rraft limited to 10.000 tons in size and It appears that they will gain their end. RUSSIANS FIGHTING. The Russian experts broughts to Lausanne by George Tchltcherin, hnud of the Soviet delegation, are attending the meetings of the sub -ommlssions on Turkish Straits and are fighting every inch of the way for Russian and Turkish conces sions. There were rumors that the Rus sians might withdraw tomorrow, but Christian Rakovsky denied them. He said that the Russians would make the best of a bad situation. Both Rakovsky and Tchltcherin have united In "warning" the Turks not to be swayed away from the Russo-Turco bloc by Allied argu ments.

At Lausanne today American envoys are contending for the freedom of the Straits. Amer ican diplomatists and diplomatic writers have been making the same contention for fifty years. From Seward to Hughes, Secre taries of State have declared the same principles, followed the same policy. Freedom of the seas! Free dom of the Straits! Fine words, glorious principles, in theory, everybody is for them. Yet, in the Congress of the United States today the question is at state whether, with that freedom established on all the seas of the earth, we should have the cour age or the enterprise to enjoy it or profit by it. HAVE NATURAL RIGHTS. Those have rights who dare maintain them. Those have free dom who dare to use it. Those have free use of the seas who venture to exercise it. THE NAKED TRL'TH. To those who neither venture nor dare there Is no principle, for either high or narrow seas, that Is worth the breath that enunci ates It. the paper It la written on. That la the ugly fact behind the fine American declarations at Lau sanne, behind - the ship subsidy debate In Congress. For half a century after the civil war the United States had the freedom of the seven seas In theory, but in theory only. In fact, the freedom of the seas was a British prerogative. It was an attribute of British power. Why lie to soothe our vanity? Why close our eyes to spare our pride? The facts and figures are not to be denied. The actual freedom of the seas was Britain s. Only the principle was ours. And what was the result? TRIBUTE TO BRITAIN. That between the civil war and the world war British ships car ried the bulk of America's com merce on the high seas; that from the beginning of the world war to 1920 they ? carried *20, 000,000,000 of our foreign traffic; that In the last ten years the American tribute to British ship* ping, shipbuilding and allied In terests has been fully *5.000.000, 000, or the amount of Great Brit ain's total war debt to the United State today; that for four-fifths of the years that elapsed after Seward made his famous declaration for the freedom of the seas, this freedom was monopolized largely by Great Britain, and America was crowded from the ocean highways by her powerful com petitor?deprived even of the op portunity to deliver her own goods across the oceans of the world. PAID OUT BILLIONS. We might have had the free dom of the seas, but we did not venture to use It. We surren dered It to Great Britain. And we paid her billions for Aer clslng It In our stead?our bil lions for using our opportunities, our billions for talcing over our commercial lights and preroga tives, our billions for transport ing our goods on the ocean high ways which supposedly were as much ours as hers. Never had a rirst-rlas* power, in the world's history, foregone its rights and opportunities aR did we?never had a great com mercial nation yielded Its deep sea traffic to the fleet of a rival, left its own rights unprotected and its own opportunities unim proved. But we did it without question, would be doing It still If by the fortunes of war we had not come, with the consent of our British competitor, into posses sion of a great merchant marine. By this merchant marine the United States can assert In fact the freedom of the seas, which it has proclaimed so oftrn in theory but in reality has yielded to its chief competitor in the markets of the world. By this merchant marine the United States can save in the future for American use the bil lions that it has been paying In tribute to the shipping of foreign nations. By this merchant marine the United States can make itself at last an Independent ,i>ow??r?Inde pendent commercially as well as politically?something it has not been for half a century, deny It as we may, blink at It as we will. NOT OLD QUESTION. The whole question that comes before the United States Senate in the ship subsidy bill today is not the old question. It Is not: Shall we build a merchant marine, or shall we emancipate our commerce from foreign control, or shall we be free at sea as we are on land, or shall our declared Independence be made at last complete in our wealth and welfare as in our politics and form of government? Not at all. All those ques tions have been relegated to the past by the construction of, a merchant marine, the possession of a merchant marine by the American people today. We have it. We are free at sea if we will. We have the Instruments oj that freedom In our hands: we have Jhe means of emancipating our business and Industry and commerce from foreign control be yond the water's edge. The ques tion therefore Is: Having a merchant marine, do we wish to scuttle It?having "the peaceful weapons of a free peo ple, do we dare to wield them? having the freedom of the seas after h?If a century again open to us, have we the energy, the en terprise, the courage to do what other nations do and venture to use It? ONLY FEASIBLE PLAN. There is only one choice as re gards this country's merchant fleet at present?use it or scuttle It. The only way to use it Is by Government aid?ship subsidy. Everything else has been tried. Everything else has failed. No other feasible plan has been sug gested In Senate or House. Aid It and use It. or abandon it arid scuttle it. That Is the alternative. Th^t any American citizen. eVen for partisan purposes, should hes itate in his choice, almost passes reason. That any American In public life hould be in favor of scuttling the ships, merely to aave an appropriation of $30,000,000 * t year. Is beyond intelllcent com prehension When we consider the national sacrifices of the last il^ years In men and money, when we recall the thousands of dead under the white crosses of France and the billions still to be paid by the liv ing. when. we realize that these men d.ed and this money was spent for the greatest honor and power of this nation, and then, turning to the Congress of the United States, find men standing out against the future prosperity, commercial Independence and peace-time power of tMs country for a mere $30.000,MRU a 'year, we can not believe that they cor rectly represent (he spirit of the American people, or everf truly represent themselves. FOIOHT FOR FREEDOM. In poverty and weakness this country fought Its way to political freedom With one-tenth the wealth and one-third the popula tion of today this country fpught to maintain and consolidate that freedom for the whole people un der Its flag. What. then, shall be said or thought of men?American men?who In these days of wealth and power hesitate, for tSO.OOO. 000 a year, to add to that political freedom the commercial freedom which should be the emblem and substance of economic Independ ence for every free people and great nation in this day and gen eration? Freedom of the seas! Freedom of the Straits' Mouth-filling words! We have had them In fact. Mexican Rebel Leader Surrenders to Obregon SAN ANTONIO. Tex., Dec. 10.?

With few exceptions, the gov ernors expressed themselves ss la hearty aceocd with the President. Ths views of the governors arc shown In the following telegram* to the New York American: 

PERCIVAL, K. BAXTER.Malne ?I give my unqualified support to President Harding. If be a all the forty-eight governors, aftsr consulting together, will issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States, re gardless of race, religion or party, to uphold prohibition and laws of this country and to refrain from violating or encouraging others to violate our prohibitory laws, such a proclamation will rank with the great documents of his tory. 

WILLIAM D. DENNY. Dels ware?I heartily favor the Pres ident's stand on prohibition en forcement. I shall be glad to co operate with him and attend the proposed conference. A. W. DONAH KY. Ohi?-l will attend such a conference If re quested by the President, and I will co-operate in law enforce ment I tv my 8tate. 

JONATHAN M. DAVIS. Kan sos 1 approve President Hard Ing's message as it relates to prohibition.

STRIOHAM. Nevada? The President's stand on prohl bition is tlmsly and proper. It will be difficult for me to at tend a conference unless held at some point west of the Mis sissippi. C. C. MOORE. Idaho?I am In entire sympathy and in favor of enforcement of the prohibi tion law aa stated In the Presi dent's message. Relative to the governors' conference, it will be Impossible for me as governor to attend. I believe such matters, as ws'.l as many others, can be straightened out. 

CHARLES R. MABEY, I'Uh? I prefer not to give publicity to my opinions or Intentions at this time. > LOUIS P. HART. WaaMngtoo ?It would be discourteous on my part publicly to discuss the matter In advance of such a con ference with the President. How ever. I have no hesitancy In say ing It is the duty of all execu tives to enforce the law as it ap pears upon the books. If s law is unworthy ol support, it ought to be repealed by executive en actment and not by Inactivity of spineless executives

FRENCH will deny Lloyd 1 Goorgo'i charges. Ameri can! will think aa they choose, depending on their racial sympa thies. But this is sure: If France and England. offi cially the other day united in a life and death struggle against conquest, are now hostile, suspi cions e/ each ether, what would happen to us if our Government, obeying the order* of interna tional finance, by which it la largely controlled, should force thi* nation into any European I league or obligatioa of any rMAY ENLIGHTEN provin cial minds at Washington to know that Britain, whose states men handle oat statesmen as children handle kittens, wants to brine Russia back into inter national life?sine* there can be no world peace without that. "It waa resolved." writes Lloyd George, "that an effort should be made to establish peace with Russia and bring that great country once more into the com munity of nations." How foolishly has the country ?influenced by foolish bankers that bought the czar's funds? fought against that step. We will pay for it. some day, and pay more than those bonds cost. A MERICANS well informed A know that the French NA TION does not want more war, does not want to seize German territory, wants only peace and security. But France, like some other republics, is governed, not by her people, but by great financial interests. Poincare, leader now in Prance, waa for years the representative of great financial interests of France, including the maker* of ammunition that earned billions in the last war, and would earn more billions in the next. NO PEOPLE want* more War, but individuals do want it. Lloyd george. to whom above all other men, and above all other forces except the courage of the French people?Europe owes her es cape from Prussian domination, speaks with knowledge and authority. He declares that the ruling power in France plans and in tends further seizure of German soil, means more war, and he writes this most solemn word, important to every human being on earth: "If the Preach ministers have made ap their minds that under no conditions will they, even at the ead of the period after occupation, withdraw from the Rhine, then a nee chapter opens in the history of Europe and the world, with a climaz of horror such as mankind has aever yet witnessed." WITH THAT WARNING be " fore It, will this nation I engage in European intrigue, European leagues, or guaran | tees? And why, in God's name, art our soldiers on the Rhine? President Harding will admit that Lloyd George probably knows more about European matters than anybody in this country can now know and If Lloyd George believes that more war is coming, with a "dimax of horror such as mankind has never yet witnessed" would it not be well for us to concentrate on readiness for such defense, and upon minding our own busi ness ?
