OUR MINISTER IN PARIS. Soon after the existing war broke out lu Europe the protection of the United States Minister in Paris was invoked in favor of Norm Germans domiciled In French territory. Instructions were issued to grant (he protection. This has been followed by an exiensionof American protection to citizens of Sax ony. llesse aud Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Columbia. Por tugal, Uruguay, the Dominican republic, Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay aud Venezuela in Paris. The charge was an ouerous one, requiring constant and severe lauor, as well os the exercise of patience, prudence and good juagmeut. It has been per formed to the entire satisfaction ot the government, ana. as 1 am officially informed, equally so to the satisfaction of tue government of Nocth Germany. recognition or ran khbnoh republic. As soon as I learned that a repnblio had been proclaimed at Paris and that the people of France hod acquiesced in the chauge the Minister of the United States was directed by telegraph to recognize it and tender my congratulations and those of the people of the United States. The re-establishment In France of a system of government disconnected with the dynastio traditions of Europe appeared to be a proper subject for the felicitations of Americans. ."Should the present struggle result in atti acting the hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government it win be a sub ject, of still further satisfaction to our people. W htle we make no effort to Impose our institutions upon the inhabitants or other countries, and while we adhere to onr traditional neutrality in civil contests, we cannot be Indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and Qlgbly civilized country like France. We were asked by the new government to use our good of fices Jointly with those of European Powers in the Interests of peace. Answer was made that the es tablished policy and the true interests of the United States forbade them to Interfere In European ques tions Jointly with the European Powers. I ascer tained informally and unofficially that the gov. ernment of North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any Powers, and though earnestly wish ing to see the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents? with all of whom the United States are on terras of friendship. 1 declined, on the part of tills government, to take a step which would only result lu Injury to our true interests witttout ad vancing the object forwhich our Intervention was invoked. Should the lime come when the action of the United States can hastea Hie return of peace by a single hour that action will be heartily takeu. THE NBtTKAI.ITV I'ROCl.AM AT10N. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number of persons oi G#nuan and Fren< n birth living in the L'nlt"d Stales, to issue, soon after official notice of a state 01 war had been received Irom botn the bel ligerents, a proclamation defining the duties ot the United States as a neutral and the obligations o: per sons residing within their territory to observa their laws and ttte laws ol nations, 'ibis proclamation was loilowed by others as circumstances seemed to call for them. The people, thus acquainted in ad vance of their duties aud obligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality 01 the United States. TBI 

INSURRECTION IN CCBA. It Is not understood thai tne condition of the In surrection in Cuba has materially changed since the close of the last session ol Congress. In an early stage 01 the contest the authorities of Spain lnati guiated a system of arbitrary arrests, of close con finement, and of military trial and execution of persons siispeclM of complicity with the insur gents, aud oi summary embargo of their pro perties and sequestration or their revenues by executive warrant. Such proceediugs. so far as thev affected the persons or property of citizens of i the United States, were in violation of the provisions | or the Treaty of 1795 betweeutlie United States and I Spam. Representations of injuries resulting to I several persons claiming to be citizens of the United States t?y reason of such violations were made ] to the Spanish government. From April, I860, to I June last the Spanish Minister at Washington had [ been clothed with a limited power to aid in redress ; lug mca wrongs. That power was round to bo ' withdrawn ? m .lew," as it was said, "or the favora ble sluintion in which the island of Cuba then was," which, however, did not lead to revocation or sub ; pension of tne extraordinary an* arbitrary func \ t ions exercised by the executive power lu Cuba, j and we were obliged 10 make our complaints at i Madrid, lu Cue negotiations thus opened and still pending there the United states only claimed that for the tnturo tne rights secured to their citiz''u>> by treaty should be respected In Cnba, and thai as to the past a joint triouial should b- established In the United Mates, with full jurisdiction over all such claims. IMore such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand Spain would ' ne at liberty to traverseevery material fact, a id thus complete equity would be done. A case which atone time threatened seriously to affect the relations be tween t lie United states and Spain has already neon disposed of in this way.

It was reierred, by the joint cousont oi Uracil and tlio United States, to the decision or Sir Edward Thorn ton, her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious tank or examin ing the voluminous mass oi correspondence and testimony submitted by the two , awarded to tii.? lilted states ih9 *i '?<>/* lOfcT* JJ? tfol i which ha* ainco been piW l?j tn% uitpcna1 ao Smment IW recent example* ^ "<o -*g wiin ii the United States have proponed to spam for amusiing the pending .ol*,m" !?v hi bernatum ble. aud that U u>?> be agreed to by el tuer n* without dishonor.

The question may then be determined by the act ion or the two houses or Congress upon a reso lution or annexation, as in ttiecase of the acquisition of Texas.

The sense of congress is desired .is early as ma* be convenient upon the proceedings of the commission <m claims against Venezuela, as communicated in my messages of March 4, 1M?, March 1, 187#, and March 31, Is.o. it has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which bat been re ceived from that government until Congress shall have acted upon the subject. TI1K CHINESE MASHACRR. Tlie massacre of French and Russian residents at Tien-'l'siii nnder circumstances ol great barbarity, were supposed by some to have been premeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese empire. The evidence falls to establish such a supposition, but shows a complicity by the local authorities with the mob. The government at Peklu, however, seems to have been disposed to lulfll its treaty obligations so tar as it was able to do so. Unfortunately the news ol the war between the German States and France reached China soon alter the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind became possessed with the Idea that this contest, extending to Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that the time was coming when the su perstitions mass might expel all foreigners and re store mandarin iniHieuce. Anticipating trouble from the cause 1 lnviteu France und Norm Germany to make an authorized suspension of hostilities in the Bast, where they were temporarily suspended by act of the commanders, and to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and pro perties of Americans and Europeans. 

TREATIES BXCHANUBI) AND HA TIKI ED. Since i he adjournment of Congress the ratifica tions of tne treaty with Great Britain for abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade hsve been exchanged. it is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Alrlca, whence the slaves are taken to Arabian maiKets. The ratifications of the naturalization csnvenuen between Great ilritam and tiie Uutted Stales have also been exchanged during the recess, and thus along staudiug dispute between the two governments has been settled In accordance wltn the principles always contended for oy the United State* Tril' nUI?SO^ BAT DIPHtOt'1 TV. In April last, wmie engaged in locating a mill ! r.ary reservation near Pembina, a corps of en gineers discovered that the commonly received boundary ilno between tiic United .Mates and the I5nu.Mli possessions at that place is about 1,700 feet south of the true position of tne forty ninth parallel, .inn that the line when run ou wnat is uow supposed to oi tne true position ot' bat parallel womd leave the lortoftho Hudson liav (JouiiMQf <u I'ciuntna within the terri tory of the United States. This Information ttelng communicated to tne JJritlab government, 1 was requested to consent, and did oonaeut, that lirltish occupation or the fort of Hudson Bay Company should continue for the present. I deem it tnipor tant, however, that turn part of the bonudary should he definitely axed by a joint commission of the two governments, and I submit herewith estimates of expeuse of such a commissiou on the part or the United states, mid recommend an appropriation for that purpose. The land bounday haa already been flxed and marked from the summit or the Uocity Mountains to the Georgian Uav. It should now tie in lue manner marked trom the Lake ut the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountain*. 'I'll K ALABAMA CI.AIMH. I regret to say that 110 conclusion has been reached lor the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the conrae adopted by that government during the rebellion. The Cabinet 01 l-ondon, ao far aa it* views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that her Majesty's government was guilty of negligence, 4>r did or permitted any act daring tne war for which the Unfed States has Just cause of complaint. I therefore recotnmeud Congross to authorize the appointment of a com mission W tajyj proof of the amotiflM 2nd tue owner ship 61 tne cTatms on noti<!4 to the representative of her Majesty at Washington, and that autbortfjr bo given for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the gov* ernment shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. It aannot be necessary to add that whenever her Majesty's government shall eutertain a deslro for a full a d friendly adjustment of these claims the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for u conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. TUB y^AUiAN FISHERY QUESTION. The cotlM pursue^ by the Canadian authorities towards the UsUermen 61 tu? U?it6u slates during the past season has not been marked by a frlendlr ieellt in. By the first article or the convention or 1818 between Great Britain and the United stales It was agreed that the inhabitants of the United Mates should have forever In common with British subjects tue right or takiug fish in certain waters therein de filed. In the waters not lucluded in the limits named In the convention (within three miles of part* of the British coast) it ba* been the custom for twenty years to give to Intruding flshormeu of the United Htates a reasonable warning of their viola tion of the technical rnrhts of Great Britain. The imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or g share of Its jurisdiction or control or these inshore fishery grounds to Hie colonial authority known as the dominion of Canada; uud this semi-Independent but Irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated pow ers in an unfriendly way Vessel-1 have been seized without notice or warning, tu violation of the cus tom previously prevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up and the vessels condemned. There Is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment wa? de signed to hear harshly upon the hardy fishermen uf the CnHed States, with a view to political effect upon this government. The statutes or the do minion or Canada assume a still broader, moro untenable Jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize officers or persons to bring vessels hovering wttlun three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors or Canada into port, to search the cargo, *o exumiue the master on oani touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty If true answers are not given; and if such a vessel is found "preparing t<> tlsli" within three marine miles of any such coasts, bays, creeks or harbors without a license, or atter tue expiration of the period named In the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tackle, Ac., snail be ror rolted. It is not known tnat. any condemnations have been made under this statute. Miould the authorities 01' Ca:iada attempt to enforce It it will become my duly to lake such steps as mav be neces sary to protect the rights of the citizen sot the United States. It has been claimed by her Majesty's officials that the lislunir vessels or Hie United stale* nave no right to enter the open ports of the British posses sions in North Ameriea, except lor the purpose of shelter and repairing damages, for purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they have no ri^hr io enter at the British Custom Houses or to trade there, except for tho purchase of wood and water, and that the.v must depart within twenty-rout houi? atter notice to leave. It is not known that any seiz ure of a Ashing vessel carrying the nag of the United States has been made under this claim. Ho far as the claim Is founded on au alleged construction of the convention of 1818 It cannot be aeqtueaced in by the Uultea Slates, it is hoped that it. will not be insisted on by her Majesty's government. During the conference wnicn preceded tne nego tiation or the convention of lsis the British Com missioners proposed to expressly exclude the fisher men of the United Hiaies Irom the privilege of carrying ou trade with anv of his Britannic Ma jcHty's subjects residing within the limits assigned tor their use, and also tnat It should not be ''lawful lor the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishery to have on boaro any goous, wares or mer chandise whatever, except such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyages to and from said fishing grounds; and any vessel of the United Slates which shall contravene this regula tion may be seized, condemned and confiscated, with her cargo.'' Thts proposition, wnich is Identi cal with the construction now pul upon the lan guage or the convention, was emphatically rejected by the American Commission, and there upon abandoned by tho British Plenipotentiaries, and Article i, as It stands in the convention, was substituted. If, however, it be said that thla claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes, and not upon the convention, this government can not but regard them as unfrienuly, and iu contra vention or the spirit, if not of the letter, of the Treaty, for the faithful executlou of which the Imperial government is alone responsi ble. Anticipating that au attempt may possi bly be made by the Canadian authorities lti the coming season to repeat their nnnelghborly acts towards our fisherman, l recommend you t* confer upon the Executive the power to suspend, by proclamation, the operation of tho laws authorizing tho transit of goods, wares and merchandise In bond across the territory of the United States to Canada, and Tarther, should suoh an extreme measure be cone necessary, to suspend the operation of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion oi Canada are permitted to enter the waters of tne United States. A Ukrf unfriendly disposition has been man treated on the part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim of the right te exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for eight States, with An aggregate popu lation of aboat 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with au aggregate tonnage of 681,887 tons upon the waters winch discharge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British compe tition, and the major part of it U done m British bottoms. If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean the monopoly of tho direct commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic wonld be in foreign hands; their vesselB on transatlantic voyages having an access to our lake ports, which would bo denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To state such a propo sition is to refute its justice. During the administra tion of Mr. John Quincy Adams Mr. Clay unques tionably demonstrated the national right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the action of the Congress of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations showed the judgment of European Jurists and statesmen; that tho inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjov the navigation of that river to and Iniothe sea, even I hough passing through the terri tory of another Power. This right does not cxclude the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river debouches into tho sea to uuKe such regulations relative to the police of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary; but those regulations should t?e framed In a liberal spirit or comity, and should not impose needless burdens upon the commerce which has the right or transit. It has been found m practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement. THE POLICE Of THK ST. LAWRF.ffCE RIVER. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the ponce of the St. Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain. If the claim ma<ie by Mr. Cla.v was just, wnen the popula tion of the Stales bordering on the shores oi the lakes was only 3,400,000, It now derives greater force and equity from the lnoreased population, wealth, productlou and tounage of the States on the Canadian frontier, since Mr. ('lay advanced his argument in behalf of our right the principle for which tie con tended has been frequently and by various nations recognized by law or by treaty, and has been ex tended to several other great rivers. FKEB NAVtUATION AN INTERNATIONAL RIGHT. By the treaty concludod at Mayence, in 1831, the Rhine wsw declared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention be tween Spain and Portugal, concluded !u 18:!5, the navigation of the Douro throughout Its whole ex tent was made free for the subjocta of both crowns. In 18&a the Argentine Confederation by treaty threw open the tree navigation of the Parana and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 18.W the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which Provided for the free navigation of the Danube, lu 858 Bolivia, by tieaty, declared tnat it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, In accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations. In 18!>? the Paraguay was mode free by treaty, and in December, ls06. the Emperor of Brazil by Imperial decree declared tho Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority ou this suoiect, while asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says:? "It seema difficult to deny thai Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, but It is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law; and, sec ondly, that her condact with respect to the navigation of the St. uawrence la in glaring and discreditable Inconsistency with her conduct with respect to tho navigation of the Mississippi, oti the Softvd that she possessed a small domain on which ? Mississippi took us rise, she Insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On tne ground tnat she possesses both banks of the St. Lawrence, where u disem bogues ltsoif into the sea, she denies to tho United Htates the right of navigatiou through about one-half ot the waters oi Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which the river r.ows, is the properly of I lie unf ed Slates. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation tram tue agricultural States oi Uie West to the Auantio seaboard.

Our depressed commerce u a subjoob to wAloh I called your apeclat attention ai the taut sesmon, and suggested that we will lu the future have to look more to the countries south of us and to China uud Japan for its removal.

I recommend an appropriation for tho construction of a building for the Department of State. TU4N8MK ok surea its.

APPROACH TO SPECIE PAYMENTS. The average value of gold as compared with national currency for the whole of the year 1809 was about 184, and for seven months or 1870 the same relative value lias been about !15. l'he ap proach to a specie basts is very gratifying, but the lad cannot be denied that the Instability el the value of our currency Is prejudicial to our pros perity, and tends to keep up prices, to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency nre so great that now, when the premium on not tl has fallen so much, it would seem i hat tin; time has arrived wlien, by wise and prudent le/islatlon. Congress -nould lock to a policy which wor.ld place our currency at par with gold at no dis tant d iy. TI1K "KKCORMS IN THK BKVKNITK." I The tax collected from the people has been reduced more than eighty million dollars per milium. By steadiness lu ourpreseut course there 1 is no reason why in a few short years the national lax gatherer ma y not disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely. With the reve nue stamp dispensed by postmasters In | every oommunttv, a tax upon liquors of :ili *orts and tobacco in nil its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon tho e articles which we could dispense with, knows as luxuries, and un those which we use more or than we produce, te venue enough may be raised, after a few years t>f peace and consequent reduction of indebtedness, to lulfli all our obligations. A fur ther reduction of expenses, in addition to a red uc tloii of Interest account, may be relied un to make Hits practicable. Revenue reform, if It means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of the government, for the payment of tlia principal and interest ot tan public debt, pensions, Ac., by directly taxing the people, theu I am against revenue reform and confidently believe the people are with me. If It means failure to provide the necessary means to del ray all expenses or t he gov ernment, aud thereby repudiation or the public onbt atid pensions, then I am still more opposed to such Kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform has not been defined by any of Its advocates, to my knowledge, but seem* to be accepted as something which Is to supply every man's wants without any cost or effort ou nls part, A true revenue reform cannot be made In a day. but must be tbe work of national legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensed with all duty should be removed from coffee, tea aud other articles of uni versal use not produced by ourselves. The necessi ties of the country compol un to eclteot revenue from our Imports. An army of assessors and collectors Is not a pleasant sighl to tbe citizen, bnt that or a tariff for revenue Is necessary. Such a tariff, so fur as It acta as au encouragement to home products, affords employment to labor at liv ing wages la contrast to tho pauper labor of the Old World, and also in the development of home re dourocSi THK BKPUCTION OP THE AltMY. unaer tue act 01 * ougress or Juiy io, isto, the army baa gradually been reduced, so that on lue jxt of January, 1871, the number or commis sioned officers and men will not exceed the num ber contemplated by that law. Tne War Depart ment building Is an old structure, not fireproof and entirely inadequate in dimensions to our preseut wants. Mauy thousands of dollars are now paid annually tor rent ef private buildings to accommo date the various bureaus ot the department. 1 recommend an appropriation for a new War Depart ment building suited to the present and growing wante of the nation. The report of the secretary of War snows a very satisfactory redaction in the ex penses of tue army lor the last fiscal year. For details you are referred to his accompanying report. 

KXFBNHKS OK THE NAVT. The expenses of the navy for the whole of the last year? i. e., from Oecemher, l*tfO? i lie date of the lust report? were less than $10,000,000, or about $1,1)00,000 loss than they were the previous year. The expen.-es since the commencement of tnls fiscal year ?i. e., since July 1? show, ^or the Ave mouths, a decrease or over $2,400,000 from those of the corresponding months last year. The estimates for the current year were $28,5tu&,?7l. These for next year are $20,688,817, with $905,100 additional for necessary permanent improvements. These estimates are made closely fer the mere maintenance of the naval establishment, as it sow is, without much lu the na ture of permanent improvement. The appropriations m*ide for the last and current years were evidently Intended bv Congress and are sufficient only to keep the navy on Its present looting by the repairing and reiltting of our old snips. Tills policy must of course gradually hut surely destroy tfie navy, and It is in itself lur lrom economical, as each year that it is pursued the necessity lor more repairs In ships and navy yards becoiucs more Imperative aud more costly," an* our current expenses are annually Increased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. 1 hope durtug itie present session ef Congress to tie able to submit to it a plan bv whloh naval vessels can be built and repairs wade with great saving npou the present cost, it can be hardly wise states manship In h government which represents a oiuntry with over five thousand miles of cost line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska, and containing forty mil lions or progressive peoplo, with relations oi every na ture with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inadequate rooatis of enforcing auy lorelgn policy either of pro'ectlon or redress. Separated by the ocean troin the nations of the Eastern Con tinent, our navy is our only means of direct protec tion to our clti'.ens abroad or lor the enforcement of any foreign policy. The accompanying report of the Postmaster Gene ral shows a most nuUsfactory working of that de partment. With the adoption oi the recommenda tion ^contained therein, particularly those relating !? a reform in the Cranking privilege and the adop tion or correspondence cards, a self-sustaining postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no dis tant dav. and a further deduction of the rate ot post age be attained. 

BKFOBM9 IN TUB IS81TK ON COMMISSIONS. I recommend authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General aud Attorney General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through their respective departments. At present these commis sions, where appointments are Presidential, are issued by the State Department. The law In all the departments of government except these of the Post Office aud of Justice, authorizes eaca to issue its own commissions. Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing, which I would like to sec remedied by this Congress. It is reform in the civil service of the eountrr. I would have it go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks and cm pi eyes, who do not require "the advice and cousent ef tne Senate" to make their appointments complete. I would have It govern not tho tenure but the manner of making all appointments. There is no mity whloU so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of depart ments as that of appointments, nor U there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Sena tors anrl Keptespntatives as that of finding places Tor constituents. The present system does noi secure the best men, and often not oveu fit men, for public places. The elevation and purification of the civil service of tUe government will be hailed with appro val by ihe wuole people of the (Juttad States. Reform in the management, oi Indian ufiuirs has received the special attention w the administration from Us Inauguration to the present day. The experiment of making it. a missionary work was tried with a l"w agencies given to the denomination ai Friends aud has been found to work moat advautagcousky All agencies and siiDortntcndeuutes uou so disposed oi were given to officers or uia army.
