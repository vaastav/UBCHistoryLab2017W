TWENTY-FIVE CENTS PER MONTH. Blalock Well Has Pressure of Sixty Pounds to Inch In the presence of Manager A. J. Tourtelotte, of the Blalock Fruit com pany, Mayor Eugene Tausick, Robert 11. Johnson, John P. Kent, Art Harris, liobert E. Allen, Water Superinten dent E. A. Knight, Fire Chief William Metz and newspaper representatives, a test of the old artesian well on the Blalock farm was made this morning at 10 o'clock, and a pressure of 60 jtounds to the square inch registered on the guage. When converted through a tire hose with a one-inch nozzel, con nected with a six-inch pipe, the stream was thrown more than a hundred feet, and when the nozzle was pointed up ward, the point reached was higher than any building in the city. Those who witnessed the test were most pleasantly surprised by the show ing and tiie possibilities, attendant upon the finding of such a flow of water have not yet been fully appre ciated. Tiie new well which con verted into a veritable "gusher" a few days ago, has not been controlled, but the flow therefrom is expected to have a greater pressure than that recorded fr.iin ihe old well this morning, as the water rises into the air almost two feet, and fills the casing which was sunk. The test made this morning was mainly for the purpose of deter mining to what uses the well might be j»ut in fighting fire, as a similar well is being sunk near the buildings on the j'arm to provide protection. A com pute tire system, consisting of a large number of hydrants and an ample quantity of hose is to be installed as soon as the well is completed, and a a direct result insurance rates are expected to be appreciably reduced. in all there are now three wells in the vicinity, the lower being 535 feet in depth, the intermediate 565 feet and the new one 580 feet feet. All produce an excellent flow of warm water, lead ing to the belief that any quantity of water may be secured for the drilling. The water, being warm, is especially desirable for irrigating purposes, as it has the effect of assisting early growth of garden truck, in which there is good money if marketed early in the .-"ason. Manager Tourtelotte this morning announced that rhubarb irri gated with the warm water was last si ring much in advance of that grown on other sections of the farm. As &oon as the well near the build- "Tag Day" for Walla Walla Soon Tag, you're it." That is what you will hear some of thes* tine days in Walla Walla if plans now being formulated by the Woman's Park c'ub are brought to a realization. "Tag day" has developed into a popu lar method of raising revemup for charitable and civic improvement pur poses and that Walla Walla is soon t«i have a"Tad day" is almost certain. "Tag day" in Seattle recently netted tht sum of $14,000 for charitable pur pose s. in Portland $8,000 was raised and in Spokane, $6,000. While it is not expected that such big sums will be realized here, it is believed that a "Tag day" will help 11 the funds of the Park club or such other organization as first uti lizes this new means of raising money in Walla Walla. There has been some Germans to Dedicate New Church Free from debt, and with a mem bership of 75, the German Methodist Episcopal church of this city will ded icate its new home at the corner of Pojilar and Seventh next Sunday. The buialing is nearly completed, and the congregation has for the first time, a church home.

While THE EVENING STATESMAN ings is completed," said Tourtelotte this morning, "we propose to drill another on the north side of the farm. I fully believe that within a period of ten years every ten acres of this farm will be supporting a fam ily. "The strata below which is found the flow of water coming from this well, seems to slope gently toward the east, making the wells below the new one shallower, while the nearer the government rasrvation w got. the deep er we had to go. For that reason, I believe, the brewers failed to secure a flow. People living below the farm, according to my findings would strike water at a much shallower depth than that at which we secured it, though the extent of the rock strata is some what in doubt. "Much difficulty is experienced i' penetrating the rock strata as it is ex ceptionally hard, and the drillers do not sink more than 9 to 18 inches a day. The strata encountered here was perhaps 12 feet in thickness." The securing cf the artesian wells on the Blalock fruit farm has interest ed property owners throughout the country in the matter, and it is prob able that tiie next year will see many take up the work of solving irrigation problems by sinking wells. An early government report c|i the conditions of artesian water says that the artesion point in the Walla Walla valley is on a line drawn from the state peniten tiary to Whitman monument, and the wells struck on the Blalock farm would indicate that the report was correct. It is said that the new well on the ranch woultfc if properly located, Y worth $100,000 to the state penitentiary and it is not improbable that Warden C. S. Reed will take steps to secure a artesian flow, as labor is plentiful there. According to the opinions of those who are conversant upom the subject, the well of the Betz Brewing com pany, if sunk deeper, would eventually strike the rock strata below which is to be found the flow of water which opens new possibilities in the way of irrigation in the Walla Walla valley.

Prison Doors Open for 64 Recommendations of Board Adjourning this morning, the state board of pardons made known their recommendations for clemency, which include 30 final discharges prison, 12 final discharges from parole, 18 pa roles and four conditional pardons. Some 200 applications for leniency were considered by the board. It is a remarkable fact that none of the recommendations include a pris oner from Walla Walla this time. Several made application but none showed sufficient reason to the board to justify them, in their minds, to grant the desired clemency. Most of the paroles and discharges are made* upon recommendation of the prison officials for exemplary charac ter and in some cases the trial judge. One however, J. W. Donovin, is given a final discharge upon recommenda tion of the British consulate, that he may be deported. All the recommend ations are unanimous. The meeting of the board was a special one, called to consider the number of cases which were brought before it, as they have piled up with such amazing rapidity since the pas sage of the indeterminate law that the regular quarterly meetings cannot take care of the business. The board adjourned to meet in its regular ses sion on January 4. The members of the board present were H. T. Jones, of Tacoma; J. H. Davis, of Spokane; Ml L. Piles, of Se attle; Warden G. S. Reed and State Clerk Walter McCallum. Paroles. Having exemplary conduct, the fol lowing prisoners, were, on recommen dation of trial officials, recommended for paroles: William Blount, King county.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—Secretary Metcalf, of the navy department, in his annual report discusses, as the most notable event of the past year, the voyage of the battleship fleet, which "has proven an eipoch-making cruise." Late in the spring of 1907 it was de cided to send the Atlantic fleet on a practice cruise to the Pacific. When the purposei of giving this assemblage of 16 battle ships such a practice cruise under severe conditions, was an nounced, he states, criticism from high tecnical quarters was heard. The un dertaking, it was said, was too monu mental; dangers more than multiplied with numbers in such a case; battle ships should not be sent around the globe on any ordinary occasion; the skeletons of some of them would doubtless be left in the Straits of Magellan; and. if thes hips should round South America, they would, one by one, arrive with machineries loose and unserviceable, and with crews reflecting the condition of the materia!. The facts are, Secretary Metcalf says, that the ships maintained sched ule time, and have practically taken care of their otn repairs on this cruise. The repair list sent in at the naval station. Cavite, P. 1., have just been received and are significant. They show that after the voyage to the dis tant borders of the Pacific, the needed repairs are negligible. The performance of the Oregon in 1898 has, it seems, been substantially repeated. This cruise, as yet hardly half over, he declares has given us an opportuni ty to get better acquainted with the republics of the south of us, with our ESTABLISHED 1861 A BOLD, BAD MAN.

Mis sissippi farmers affiliated with the Farmers' union are up in arms against the attempt of the colored agricultur ists of the state to organize a similar union. It is feared that trouble may result from the attempt of the negroes to establish a union, and in somei lo calities the white farmers are threat ening night rider tactics, if necessary to put a stop to the propaganda of the negro organizers. The matter will probably come up at the next meeting of the state union, which will be held next month. Louis Horner, Whatcom county. Conditional Pardons. The following four prisoners, having exemplary prison conduct, and being supported by recommendations of trial judges and prosecuting attorneys, were recommended for conditional par dons: John Walsh, committed from Snoho mish county. Charles Kinney, committed from Snohomish county. George Cornwall, from King county. George Smith, committed from Oka nogan county. Final Discharge. The following prisoners, having served thedr minimum sentence under the indeterminate sentence law, and having exemplary conduct to their credit, are recommended for final dis charge: , Richard J. Purcell, Ferry county. L. H. Alger, Okanogan county. James Coghlan, Spokane county. W. J. Donovin, Benton county. W. S. Fridley, Pierce county. John Harrison, King county.

' own island possessions, with the new and vigorous branch of the British em ■ pire in Australia, and particularly with , Japan; and has given to those coun , trie s a better opportunity to get ac : quainted with us. It has been every where understood and accepted, as it was intended, as the reaching out of a . strong hand in friendly greeting on i the part of America, and the cordial i hospitalities extended to our fleet will > be long remembered, and have power fully influenced feeling in this country. i Between the United States and every country visited there is feeling of deeper interest and friendship than I existed. i Passing to certain recent criticisms i of the new and larger battle ships ! now building, the secretary says that [ at the conference, convened and opened ! by the president at Newport, the gen [ eral matter of design of these ships - was approved, after forty-three days' ► consideration, by this assemblage of i the best authorities available in the . navy, consisting of about 60 officers ; all but seven of whom were line offi cers of the seagoing branch of the ser t vice. Markmanship he says has improved [ on the practice cruise. With respect 1 to the assertion that our 12-inch guns r are inferior to those of other powers, ■ the facts are found to be that the act l ual muzzle energy of the 12-inch guns, i which form the mam armament of our eight latest battle ships in commis sion, is somewhat greater than that of , any gun afloat in any other navy. As the officer in command of the ; American fleet now in the far east ■ holds the rank of rear-admiral only, he is in a position of subordination to foreign naval officers. This is true be cause foreign powers have, on im portant naval stations, representatives of the rank of vice-admiral. The secretary urgee that the navy should, without delay, be provided with two vice admirals. It is desirable, the secretary states, to lengthen the dry dock authorized by congress to bei constructed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from 850 to 1140 feet, to render it capable of accommodat ing two or more vessels at once. Secretary Metcalf recommends that the ifavy yards at New York, Phila delphia, Norfolk, Puge* Sound, and Mare Island be developed to their full capacity for the repair and mainte nance of ships, but says it is not fur ther desirable to develop other navy yards, at least until that at Guantana mo shall have> been equipped, the last named station being regarded as of the first military importance and a s a nat ural strategetic base. It is deemed highly desirable to ac quire by purchase or to construct a dock in San Francisco harbor. With the acquisition of such a dock, and the bringing- up to high efficiency of the yards at Bremerton and Mare Island, another navy yard on the Pa cific coast will not be necessary for some time to come. The navy department being a large business organization, Mr. Metcalf suggests rearrangements of the duties of any bureau are exceedingly diffi cult and complex, and necessarily rests with congress; but those who speak of thei millions unnecessarily sp%nt annually by the lack of econom ical administration do not realize that a comparatively small percentage of the annual budget goes for repair and maintenance of the material of the fleet. The greater part is expended for the pay and provisioning of the navy and marine corps, ammunition, fuel, and expenditures on account of increase of the navy. So far as con cerns the last-named item, the depart ment has long been an exceedingly economical purchaser, the contract price of our latest battle ships being hardly more than the actual cost of labor and material and incidental ex penses, and very considerably below the limit fixed by congress. Thei secre tary says also that it would be diffi cult to find in any large manufactur ing establishment, or other industrial organization, greater coordination than exists- among the heads of the great bureaus and offices of the navy depart ment. The secretary recommends that con gress authorize at its approaching session the construction of four bat tle ships, four scout cruisers, 10 de stroyers, four übmarine, three colliers, one repair ship, one ammunition ship, ships to be converted from cruisers now on the navy list. Cavalry Nay Go to Islands The Fourteenth cavalry will in all probability be ordered to the Philip pines by the war department next spring, the regiment, including the two troops stationed at Boise barracks, the four troops stationed at Fort Walla Walla and six troops at Presidio, Cal., to sail from San Francisco about the first of May. Although orders to the above effect have not been received as yet at Fort Walla Walla, reliable reports indicate that the movement of the regiment will be accomplished in the spring to relieve troops returning home from the Philippines. The order to the Four teenth cavalry will apply to the Four teenth cavalry band, one of the most renowned musical organizations of the northwest, which has been generally assigned to duty at Fort Walla Walla. The officers will in all probability take their families with them to the inland possessions. The movement of the troops will result in other troops being detailed to duty at Boise bar racks, Walla Walla and Presidio, and it is likely that one of the regiments of cavalry returning from duty in the islands will be assigned to fill the posts vacated the troops of the Fourteenth cavalry.

Johnson Says He Would Not linow How to Buy Pool "I don't know whether this Ole Ol son is playing politics, or what he is doing," said Robert H. Johnson, secre tary of the Walla Walla County Fair association, last night when Ole Han son's communication asking the Com mercial club to adopt resolutions fav oring including race track and pool room gambling in the same category with other forms of gambling, was read. "I wish to say that I am not upholding gambling, for I could not go to a booth and intelligently purchase a pool. This is not a matter to come before this club, and I move that it be placed on the table." As that seemed to be the opinion of all present, it was so disposed of, though Tom Mosgrove entered a mo tion that the communication be re ferred to a committee consisting of Secretary Robert Johnson.

San Francisco is rej >ic ing and the prosecution is jubi lant. SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 11.—Heney made the following statement: "Needless to say I am gratified with the result. I fully expected conviction if nonet of the jurors were reached by Ruef's agents. It is evident they are all honest." Johnson's statement follows: "We 1 have disproved that our law is a sham, that our administration of justice is travesty. Ruefs race is run. His con viction sounds the death knell of his system and that of his accomplices, the public service corporations, the system by .which a political boss sells. to an t?v-ally guilty corporation boss privileges and rights which belong to the people. Henceforth Ruef' s person ality will be eliminated from this city." District Attorney Langdon made this statement: "The public is familiar with the evi- 1 elence which made it apparent that no honest jury could do other than con vict. The graft prosecution will con tinue until it makes a demonstration that San F"rancisco is capable of en forcing laws and that the courts and juries are not a mockery and a sham." ! The resignations of Attorneys Hi- ! ram W. Johnson, Matt L. Sullivan and J. J. Dwyer as special prosecutors in the graft cases will bei presented to District Attorney Langdon today. The i trio volunteered their services after Heney was shot and with t # he convic tion of Ruef they foel that their du ties are ended.

The members appointed to the com mittee of five are: Perkins, Denby,, of Michigan, and Weeks of Massachu setts, republicans; and Williams of Mississippi and Lloyd of Missouri, democrats. The resolution says: "Whereas the message from the president to the houses of congress has stated in ref erence to tha*. provision, that it is not too much to say that this amendment Shriners Are Coming Tomorrow More than 150 members of El Katlf temple, nobles of the Mystic Shrine, will arrive in the city from Spokane tomorrow on their special O.

Johnson said yesterday's * victory means more to San Francisco than a score of triumphs in warfare. Addressing a mass meeting of citi zens Attorney Johnson said: "We have completed the work for which we entered the prosecution and we now surrender the trust. We took up the case where Heney was forced to leave off and feel that our obliga tions have ceased with the conviction of Ruef." He declared the real purpose of prosecution should be not merely to punish persons and send grafters to jail, but to purge the government so as to establish the equality of men in the eyes of.the law. Langdon said that the conviction Is only the forerunner of others, adding that the "arch criminal of San Fran- Cisco is now on his way to the pen tentiary." Detective Burns declared it was plainly the people's victory and that the people are vindicated. "The prosecution's plans are un comi leted in detail, but it is probable that Pn trick Calhoun, president of the T'nited Railroads will be the next to be tried. He will be charged with bribing a supervisor. Langdon said today: "It is not de cided what indictment to try him on. We will not try Ruef again immedi ately on the remaining indictments and it is probable that the prosecutions energy will be centered on Calhoun." » Calhoun will be summoned back from New York, where he is said to be negotiating the sale of the United Railroads to Harriman. It is expect ed that Heney will give particular at tention to the Calhoun trial. has been of benefit only and could be of benefit only to criminal clashes," The resolution then quotes, the mes ?a?o referring 1 to the use of the secret service force is investigating members of congress. Perkins arose and said: "The statements made by the presi dent cannot be lightly disregarded. They may be construed by the public to lessen the dignity and thereby im pair the usefulness of congress. Whe ther it can be justly said that those expressions of the president are un fortunate, must rest with congress, exercising wise and discreet judgment to decide." The resolution was adopted without debate and Speaker Cannon imme diately appointed the committee. It was reported late this afternoon that the president is primed with all sorts of important information received from the secret service. An elaborate menu, with the head- line, "Here are the Goods" In bright red letters, has been printed, and pre ceding 1 the various courses are> quota tions from Shakespeare and other poets appropriate to the occasion. For instance, the quotation: "He that hath no stomach for this fight, let him de part," appears at the head of the menu following which are the words, "Oyster Cocktail, a la Koumiss." The banquet will last until near 2 o'clock Sunday morning, when the visitors will leave on their special train for their homes.
