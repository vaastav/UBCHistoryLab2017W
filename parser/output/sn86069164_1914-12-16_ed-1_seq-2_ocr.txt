One of them the State of runs through Kentucky from north to south; tne other from east to west, mey cross at Richmond. But Richmond is more than a mere railroad crossing. Io the heart of tbBluegrass, with the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains in sight on the east and south, it is the gateway to the richest section or the State. Is she improving her opportunities? Is she getting what she should have by reason of her excellent position? A school boy knows the answer she is not! Then what is the matter? We have the in telligence, the money, the natural re sources, but with all this we are lagging behind in the race for population and enterprises. Many large wholesale hous es and factories should be located here. We had some, yet in the last few months we have lost one of the largest of these. One of our largest tobacco houses failed to open for business this season. In a few davs we will Jose me macoine auuy. The loss of these three concerns away a biz source of income. takes Are enterprises being welcomed here as they should be? Are the people unit a rnpr&1 nlan to rromote and encouraee business? They are not Why can not a new spirit be born in this community, which has been blessed with so much, and why can not we get to gether and invite the stranger to come our way? UNCONSTITUTIONAL.. Last Friday the Court of Appeals de- rlaroH unconstitutional the Workman's Compensation Act. Special Juc'ga Dor m. rnia th nninion. which was con curred in by four of the court. Chief Justice Hobson and Judges Lassing and Miller dissented. The act under consideration, passed by the last Legislature, was clearly in conflict with the Kentucky constitution. The constitution prohibits the Legisla ture trom passing a law limiting liabil ity in the case of death. But the act in question undertook to get around this constitutional provision and gave the corporations of the Stale a law which would practically prevent an employe from bringing a suit to recover for an injury received at their hands. Besides being clearly unconstitutional, because it was an express violation of the constitution, it was also unconsti tutional on the ground that it was con trary to a sound public policy. It is ridiculous to say that either an em ploye or an employer are to be bound in the transaction of their private affairs by a law which limits the rizht of both parlies in the transaction, neither of whom bad any voice in the making of the law, and all of whom are adults. Nearly everything that the last Legis lature did has been declared unconstitu tional, yet it cost the Stale over $150,000 to bold the Legislative session. Again we say that we stand for a Legislature every ten years and for a qualification attached to the members thereof. 1 he biate demands that coun ty clerks, circuit clerks, county attor neys, commonwealth s attorneys, cir cuit judzes and judges of the Court of Appeals shall have certain qualifications before holding their offices, but when it comes to making the law, just "any old thing" will do. The last session of the Legislature is a strong argument in favorof abolishing it FARMING BY NOTE. Some years ago there was much in the magazines about frenzied finance. It at least bad the merit of having been writ en by financiers. - In this day we are having a phobia about scientific farm ing. Aiucn oi tne agitation is ty men who have never had hold of the plow handles and who, if they were sentenc ed to do a day's plowing in the field, would hitch old Dobbin "hind-end-fore most to tne plow, let, it s m the air and the demand is that they be taught by these lily-white-handed fellows, who never did an honest day's work in their lives. What will be the end of all these societies combinations and assocalions. waose cniei ena is. to devise means whereby a man may be separated from his money, only the good Lord knows. That a farmer should be taught soil Conservation and soil fertility, no one aouots. uut the farmer who listens to fakirs is merely wasting his time. ' Farm ing is not played by note. EDISON'S LOSS. The great plants of Thos. A. Edison were burned last Wednesday at West Orange, N. J. The property loss is about 1 7, 000,000, insurance 82,CO0,0O0. This may be the loss in money value, but the loss to Mr. Edison and the world is still greater. At the advanced age of 70 he cannot now renew his plant and have before him the experience of the past. It is true that his successes re main inj)art and can be replaced. But there is in the life of an inventor a cer tain value in his failures. Many of these roads must be traveled again with much toil aad patience. These were the step ping stones to his successes. There is a value in the old familiar things, tools and appliances. It is like a well-worn and familiar book. When it is lost, the new book cannot take its place. So it will be with Mr. Edison. The world sympathizes with him in his loss.

We print on page 8 of this issue the message of President Wilson, delivered at the opening of Congress. The President writes like a man of peace desiring the greatest of peace for this and all other countries. On the whole, it shows that he has spent much time and exercised great care in its prep aration. There is one part of the message that we do not understand. The Democratic party has always been opposed to ship subsidy and the President and his Cabi net recently threw a fit on that point when they urged Congress to repeal the Free Toll Act for the Panama Canal. Yet the President is now urging that the Government own and operate a fleet of shins to open up the trade between this country and South America. He makes the remarkable statement that after all this is done at Government expense and operated long enough to make it pronta ble, that then it could be turned over to individual companies. The question at once arises why should the Govern ment turn it over to individuals if it blazes the way and makes it profita ble? 

SHOOTING OVER THE LINE. The Mexican bandits, under Villa and Carranza, are at their old game and are shooting across the border. President Wilson has issued an ultimatum that it must cease or otherwise he will take a hand in the shooting. The President is a man of peace, but when one of these quiet fellows srets "riled," he puts up a stiff fighi. BIG 

PANIC AVERTED. Secretary McAdoo says that he pre vented a big panic by his careful man ipulation of the Federal reserve funds. Probably he has. Uut what we are most interested in where has he put the panic and has he securely tied it down? Also he mieht inform us where and when General Confidence will be born. The people want to fall down and wor ship him. The Kaiser has pneumonia and is al most prostrated from overwrought nerves. Wonder if conscience bad any thing to do with it?

COOPER CREATES A DEEP IMPRESSION. Philanthropist and His Celebra ted Tanlac Much Discussed In State. L. T. Cooper, the man who has been so widely discussed in Lexington and the larger cities of the country, is now creating a profound impression with bis health theories and celebrated medicine throughout Central Kentucky. Mr. Cooper is a -man of rare talents, magnetic force and charm of manner. He never ceases to surprise you with the Infinite variety of bis knowledge and its absolute correctness and 'thorough ness. Mr. Cooper claims chiefly that most of the ill health of today is due almost entirely to those habits which best dis tinguish the white man from the savage of the jungle. He says that . nine times out of ten it is the result, more or less, of a weakened, out-of-order stomach. and nine times put often these disorders are due to too much eating aud drinking and onr other faulty methods of living. But It is aJwaps possible to make some effort toward healthful living, he says, and in connection with his lectures, he I is introducing . his famous" medicine. Tanlap. to prove his theories. Tanlac is called the magic medicine and is made mainly from the medicinal properties of a plant discovered on an island in the Pacific Ocean, west of Mexico. It is said that Tanlac quickly over comes stomach, kidney and intestinal ailments, and will actually prolong life by restoring and keeping up the vigor of youth. In New York, boston and Philadel phia, as well as in Lexington, tens of thousands have been converted to Coop cr's theories and have teen benefited by his marvelous medicine. tie gives tne agency lor nis medicine lo o.j one drug store in each city.
