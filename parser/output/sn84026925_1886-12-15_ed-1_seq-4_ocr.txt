From any part of the car you can drop a nickel into one of these car- i rlere and then watch it as it rolls along on i its edge down the incline and finally goes i rattling into the fare-box. I saw a wild t western ranchman come into a car, and after putting his fare in the ordinary way he noticed a new-comer drop a nickel down the ( elevated railway. The device aroused his t utmost admiration. He at once changed a , couple of dollars into 5-cent pieces. Then < he took his place ax the door and started two nickels simultaneously down each side | of the car and offered to accept bets as to which would get into the fare-box first. He kept this up until his $2 worth of coin was gone, and wound up by saying: "Wall, that's the durndest contrivance I ever see." Detroit Free Press. ?- - . Willing to Quit.?A good story is told of an interview of W..H. H. Bingham with one of the state boarders at Windsor. Some of the prisoners were at work lathing the guard room during a recent official visit of i the governor, and the latter was inspecting the progress of the work. After contemplating the process for a few minutes, Governor Bingham remarked: "See here, my man, you are laying those laths too near together; thatsort of work will never do." The prisoner calmly laid down his implements and said: "Governor, I am willing to be turned off and discharged if my work don't suit; I never applied for this job or the situation, and if my work isn't satisfactory, I am willing to quit."

The message of President Cleveland, read >efore both houses of Congress, 011 the first lay of the present session presents in a satsfactory manner the friendly and amicable elations existing between the United States ind all foreign powers, closing this branch )f the subject with the following reference ;o Mexico: "Incompliance with a resolution of the Senate, I communicated to that body on \ugust 2, last, and also to the House of Representatives, the correspondence in the case >f A. K. Cutting, an American citizen then mprisoned in Mexico, charged with the lommission of a penal offence in Texas, of ivhieh a Mexican citizen was the object. \fter demand had been made for his release he charge against him was amended so as n innlnflo q violation of Moxioan l;iVV with n Mexican territory. This rejoinder of aleged offences, one within and the otherex:erior, induced me to order a special invesigation of the case, pending which Mr. Cutting was released. The incident has, towever, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction ^Mexico novel iu our history, whereby my offence, committed anywhere by a foriigner, penal in the place of its commission ind of which a Mexican is the object, may, f the offender be found in Mexico, he there iried and punished in conformity with Mexican laws. This jurisdiction was sustained by the Courts of Mexico in the Cutting case, ind approved by the executive branch of ;hat Government, upon the authority of a Mexican statute. The Appellate Court in releasing Mr. Cutting decided that the abanionment of the complaint by the Mexican ritizen aggrieved by the alleged crime, (a libelous publication,) removed the basis of further prosecution, and also declared justice to have been satisfied by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence. The admission of such a pretension would oe attended with serious results, invasive of the jurisdiction of this government, and highly dangerous to our citizens in foreign lands. Therefore, I- have denied it, and protested agaiust its attempted exercise as unwarranted by,the principles of law and international usage. A sovereign has jurisdiction of offences which take effect within his territory, although concocted or commenced outside of it, but the right is denied of any foreign sovereign to punish a litizen of the United States for an offence A! Aiif JOIIlUJIlieu Ull UUL SUll iui v luiaviuu ui uui laws, even though the offence be against a jubject or citizen of such sovereign. The Mexican statute in question makes the claim broadly, and the principle, if conceded, would create a dual responsibility in the ntizen and lead to inextricable confusion, Jestructive of that certainty in the law which is an essential of liberty. When citzens of the United States voluntarily go into a foreign country they must abide by Ihe laws there in force, and will not be pro;ected by their own government from the :onsequence of an offence against those laws jommitted in such foreign country. But ;he watchful care and interest of this government over its citizens are not relinquished because they have gone abroad, and if barged with crime committed in a foreign and, a fair and open trial, conducted with lecentregard for justice and humanity, will pe demanded for them. With less than this heir government will not be content when ;he life or liberty of a citizen is at stake. Whatever the degree to which ultra-territo ial criminal jurisdiction may have been ormerly allowed by consent and reciprocal igreement among certain of the European States, no such doctrine or practice was ever snown to the laws of this country, or of that xora which our institutions have mainly peen derived. In the case of Mexico there ire reasons especially strong for perfect harnony in the mutual exercise ofjurisdiction; lature has made us irrevocably neighbors, ind.wisdom and kind feeling should make is friends. The overflow of capital and en:erprise from the United States is a potent actor in assisting the development of the esources of Mexico, and building up the prosperity of both countries. To assist this rood work all grounds of apprehensions for ;he security of person and property should pe removed, and I trust that in the interest pf good neighborhood that statute referred :o will be modified so as to eliminate the present possibilities of danger to the peace )f the two countries." He recommends the revision of the exsting legislation concerning citizenship ind naturalization, and says: "We have reaties with many States providing for the enunciation of citizenship by naturalized diens, but no statute is found to gi ve effect o such engagements, nor anv which pro j 1- 4.? i ziaes a neeueu*ceiiutu uuicau mi mc jcgioration of naturalized citizens. Experience suggests that our statutes regulating extraction might be advantageously amended >y a provision for the transit across our territory, now a convenient thoroughfare of ravel from one foreign country to another, >f fugitives surrendered by a foreign govern men t to a third State. Such provisions ire not unusual in the legislation of other oun tries. and tend to prevent the miscarriage of justice. It is also desirable in orler so remove-the present uncertainties that luthority should be conferred on the secretary of State to issue a certificate, in case )f arrest, for the purpose of extradition to ;he officer before whom the procceeding is pending, showing that requisition for the surrender of the person charged has been luly made. Such a certificate, if required :o be received before the prisoner's examnation, would prevent a long and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge which :he foreign government might not desire to sress. I also recommend that express provisions be made for the immediate discharge from custody of persons committed for extradition where the President is of jpinion that the surrender should not be made." Of the public finances, he says: "The report of the secretary of the treasury exhibits in detail the condition of the public inancesand of the several branches#!' the rovernment related to his department. 1 .^specially direct the attention of Congress :o the recommendation contained in this ind the last preceeding report of the secretary touching the simplification and imendment of laws relative to the collec:ions of revenues, and in the interest of jconomy and justice to the government I hope they may be adopted by appropriate legislation. The ordinary receipts of the government for the fiscal year ended June JO, 188G were $336,439,727.06 and of this imount $192,903,023.41 was received from lustoms and $116,805,936.48 from internal revenue and the total receipts as here stated ivere $13,749,028.68 greater than for the previous year. The increase from customs was $11,434,084.10. And from internal revrevenue $4,407,210.94 making a gain in these items for the last year of $15,841,296.04 but \ falling off in other resources, reduced the total increase to the smaller amount mentioned. The expense at the different custom houses, of collecting this increased cus toms revenue, was less than the expense attending the collection of such revenue for the preceding year, by $390,008 and the increased receipts of internal revenue were collected at a cost to the internal revenue bureau of $155,944 99 less than the expense of such collection for the previous year. The total ordinary expenses of the government for the fiscal year ended June (10,1880, were $242,485,138.30, being less by $17,788,787 than such expenditures for the year preceeding, and leaving a surplus in the treasury at the close of the last fiscal year of $93,958,588.50 as against $03,463,701.27 at the close of the previous year, being an increase in such surplus of $30,492,817.29." He recommends a reduction of the revenues and the application of the large surplus in the treasury to the extinguishing of the public debt. Of the evil of Federal taxation, he says: "But it is not the simple existence of this surplus and its threatened attendant evils which furnish the strongest argument against our present scale of Federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of the relations between the people and their Government and a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right of Federal taxation. Good government, and especially the government of which every American citizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person within its care in the greatest liberty consistent with the good order of society, and his perfect se- t curity in theenjoyment of his earnings with i the least possible domination for the public | c needs. When more of the people's sub- ; c stance is exacted through the form of taxa- 11 tion than is necessary to meet the just ob- j ligations of the Government and the ex- ! 1 pense of its economical administration, f t such exaction becomes ruthless extortion ' r and a violation of the full fundamental t principles of free government. The indi- a rect manner in which these exactions are { made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. t "But we have arrived at a stage of su- c perfluous revenue which has aroused the a people to a realization of tho fact that the i amount raised professedly for the support r of the government is paid by them as ab solutely as if?added to the price of the ( things which supply of their daily wages? t it was paid at fixed periods into the hand 1 of the tax-gatherer. Those who toil for i daily wages are beginning to understand r. that capital, though sometimes vaunting t its importance and clamoring lor tne pro- i c tection of the Government, is dull and 11 sluggish till, touched by the magical hand ? of labor, it springs into activity, furnishing t an occasion for taxation and gaining the < value which enables it to bear its burden, i and the laboring man is thoughtfully in- f quiring whether, in these circumstances and j considering the tribute he constantly pays f in the public treasury, as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share of i advantages. c "There is also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenue indicates abnormal ( and exceptional business profits, which* t under the system which produces such sur- j plus, increase with corresponding benefit j to the people at large. The vast accumu- * lations of a few among our citizens whose t fortunes, rivaling the wealth of the most i favored in Anti-Democratic nations, are i not the natural growth of a steady, plain ( and industrious republic. - t Our farmers, too, and those engaged di- 1 rectly and indirectly in supplying the pro- t ducts of agriculture, see that, day by day, i and as often as the daily wants of their 1 households recur, they are forced to nay ( excessive and needless taxation, while I their products struggle in foreign markets 1 with the competition of nations which, by c allowing; a freer exchange 01 productions tha'n we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the American farmer. As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of our people in American civilization and in the glory of our national achievements and progress, a sentiment prevails that the leaching strings, useful to a nation in its infancy, may well be to great extent discarded in the present stage of American ingenuity, courage and fearless self-reliance; and for the privilege of indulging this sentiment with true American enthusiasm, our citizens are quite willing to forego an idle surplus in the public treasury, and all the people know that the average rate of Federal taxation upon the imports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some articles of necessary consumption it is actually more than was imposed by the grevious burden, willingly borne, at a time when the Government needed millions to maintain by war the safety and integrity of the Union." A revision of the tariff isalso recommended, and as affecting the laboring man he says on this question: "Due regard should be also accorded in ! any proposed readjustment to the interest of I American labor, so far as they are involved. i We congratulate ourselves that there is < among us no laboring class fixed within un- ' yielding bonds and doomed under all condi- ( tions to the inexbrablefateof daily toil. We < recognizeinlaborachieffactor in the wealth < of the Republic, and we treat those who 1 have it in their keeping as citizens entitled 1 to the most careful regard and thoughtful at- ' tention. This regard and attention should < be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of government favor, but for the further and not less important reason 1 that the laboring mau, surrounded by his i family in his humble home, as a consumer, i is vitally interested in all that cheapens the < cost of living, and enables him to bring I within his domestic circle additional com- < forts and advantages. This relafion of the I workingman to the revenue laws of the i country, and the manner in which it palpa- i bly influences the question of wages, should i not be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper maintenance of 1 the supply and protection of well-paid labor; 1 and these considerations suggest an arrange- i merit of government revenues. i "But our farmers and agriculturists, those | who from the soil produce the things consumed by them, are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizens in a just and careful system of Federal taxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this kind of work, number nearly one-half of our population. None labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of the government enhances to any great extent the value of their products.. And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for the implements of husbandry they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, which by the action of the government, is given to the more favored manufacturer. I recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and unnecessary surplus of the national income, annually accu- ' mulating, be released to the people by an j amendment to our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of i life and give freer entrance to such import- i ed materials as by American labor may be I manufactured into marketablecommodities. < Nothing can be accomplished, however, in 1 this much-needed reform unless the subject I is approached in a patriotic spirit of devo- ] tion to the interests of the entire country, I and with a willingness to yield something I for the public good." On the question of silver coinage he says : ' "During the fiscal year ended June*30, 1 1886, there were coined under the compulsory silver coinage Act of 1878, 29,838,905 sil- 1 ver dollars, and the cost of the silver used I in such coinage was $23,448,960. There had 1 been coined up to the close of the previous 1 fiscal year, under the provisions of the law, 1 203,882,551 silver dollars, and on the first day of December, 1886, the total amount of such ( coinage was $247,131,540. "The director of the mint reports that at ( the time of the passage of the law of 1878, > directing this coinage, the intrinsic value of the dollars thus coined was ninety-four and one-fourth cents each, and that on the 31st day of July, 1886, the priceof silver reached f the lowest stage ever known, so that the in- i trinsicor bullion priceof our standard silver ( dollar at that date was less than 72 cents. ( The price of silver on the 30th day of No- < vember last was such as to make these dol- | * * " " a ^ 1 _ rnu? lars intrinsically worm ittceniseacu. mese differences in value of the coins represent the fluctuations in the price of silver, and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage by the government enhances the price of that commodity, or securesuniformity in its value, and every fair and legal effort has been made by the treasury department to distribute this currency among the people. The withdrawal of United States treasury notes of small denominations, and the issuing of small silver certificates have been resorted to in the endeavor to accomplish this result in obedience to the sentiments of the representatives of the people in the Congress. On the 27th day of November, 188G, the people held of these coins, or certificates representing them, the nominal sum of $166,873,041, and we still had $79,464,.'145 in the treasury, as against about $142,894,055 in the hands of the people and $72,865,376 remaining in the treasury one year ago. "The director of the mint again urges the necessity of more vault room for the purpose of storing these silver dollars, which are needed for circulation by the people. "I have seen no reason tochange the views expressed in my last annual message on the subject of this compulsory coinage, and I again urge its suspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommenuauou, i reinforced by the significant increase of our gold exportation during the last year, as ap- t pears by the comparative statement here- ( with presented, and for the further reason i that the more this currency is distributed s among the people the greater it becomes i our duty to protect it from disaster; that we c now have abundance for all our needs, and j hat thero seems but little propriety in buildng vaults to store such currency, when the ?nly pretence for its coinage is the necessity if its use by the people as a circulating melium." He reviews the report of the Secretary of iVar, and approves various recoramendaions it contains for the improvement of the nilitary service, among the recommendaions that officers be required to submit to in examination as a preliminary to their >romotion. He also reviews at length the reports of he postoffice department, the department >f justice, tho department of the interior, md some special recommendations for the mprovement of the service of the departnents is urged. A hopeful view is taken of the condition >f the Indians, and attention is directed to he fact that very few of them are now trou>lesome, and that most of the tribes are subnissive to the control of the government, rhey have, as the President says, a peculiar :laim upon the fostering care and protection >f the Nation; The government cannot reieve itself of its responsibility until they ire trained and civilized so as to be able to ako care of themselves. The maintenance )f the rights of actual settlers upon governnent lands is commended to Congress, and ippropriate legislation is suggested for the protection of the national domain from speculative corporations and individuals. The manifold abuses under the existing pension laws are shown and correctives recommended. On the absorbing questions of labor and capital he says: "The relations of labor ;o capital and of laboring men to their employers are of the utmost concern to every patriotic citizen. When these are strained ind distorted unjustifiable claims are apt :o be insisted upon by both interests, and n the controversy which results the .velfare of all and the prosperity of the ountry are jeopardized. Any intervenion of the General Government within the imit of its constitutional authority to ivertsucha condition should be willingly iccorded. In a special message transmit:ed to Congress at its last session I suggested the enlargement of our present labor pureau and adding to its present functions ;he power of arbitration in cases where iifferences arise between employer and employed, and when these differences reach such a stage as to result in the interruption >r commerce Decween me ouues, uiq amplication of this remedy by the General Joyernment might be applied as entirely .vithin the constitutional powers, and I :hink we might reasonably hope that such irbitrators, if carefully selected and if en:itled to the confidence of the parties tc >e affected, would be voluntarily called to she settlement of controversies of less extent and not necessarily within the domain >f regulation. I am of the opinion that this suggestion is worthy the attention ol the Congress. But after what has beer. Jone by the passage of laws, either Federil or State, to relieve a situation full ol solicitude, much more remains to be accomplished by the reinstatement and cultivation of a true American sentiment, .vhich recognizes the equality of American citizenship. This, in the light of traditions ind loyalty to the spirit of our institutions, would teach that a hearty co-operation on the part of all interests is the- sure path to national greatness and the happiness ol ill our people; that capital should, in recognition of the brotherhood of our citizenship and in a spirit of American fairness, generously accord to labor its just compensation and consideration, and that contented labor is capital's best protection and raithful ally. It would teach, too, that the liverse situations of our people are inseparable from our civilization, that every citizen should in his sphere be a contribator to the general good, that capital does not necessarily tend to the oppression ol abor, and that violent disturbance and disorders alienate from their promoters true American sympathy and kindly feeling.'1 Of civil service reform he says: "The continued operation of the law renting to our civil service has added the most convincing proofs of its necessity and usefulness. It is a fact worthy of note thai every public officer who has a just idea ol uis duty to the people testifies to the value >f this reform. Its staunchest friends are round among those who understand it best, ind its warmest supporters are those whc ire restrained and protected by its requirements. The meaning of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those whc want places under the government, regardless of meritand efficiency, nor bv those whc Insist that theselection for such places should rest upon proper credentials showing active partisan work. They mean to public offices, nevertheless, the only opportunity offered them to attend to public business, and they mean to the good people of the country the netter performance of the work of theii government. It is exceedingly strange thai the scope and nature of this reform are sc little understood, and that so many things not included in its plan are called by its name. When cavil yields more fully to exunination the system will have large additions to the numbers of its friends. Out civil service reform may be imperfect in jome of its details, it may be misunderstood ind opposed, it may not always be faithfully applied, its designs may sometimes miscarry through mistake or wilful intent, il may sometimes tremble under the assaults nf its enemies or languish under the misguided zeal of impracticable friends, but il the people of this country ever submit tc the banishment of its underlying principle from the operation of the government, they will abandon the surest guarantee of the safety and success of American institutions. [ invoke for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of Congress. I renew my recommendation made last year that the salaries of the commissioners be made ?qual to those of other officers of the government, having like duties and responsibilities, and I hope that such reasonable appropriations may be made as will enable them to increase the usefulness of the cause they have in charge." Tho nnfonl, nflli'P is nnw nnl v thrpp month? Dehincfin its work, less than in years, and ivill soon be squarely up with it. Attention is called to the United States Supreme Court decisions depriving States ol power to regulate railroad charges beyond :heir limits, and Congress is recommended :o assume control of the matter so relegated to it. He urges that payment of all the balances lue to depositors in the Freedman's Savings Bank be provided for, and closes with reference to the control of the affairs of the District of Columbia. CLUVEKIl'S TO

On the 7th instant Governor Lee, of Virginia, sent a letter to the counsel of Clurerius, who is now in the Richmond jail unler sentence of death for the murder of his cousin Fannie Lilian Madison, in which he >ays that he has given the statements, and :oall papers and petitions presented for Executive clemency in behalf of the prisoner, he careful consideration which their importance demanded. The Governor then idds: "The prisoner came from the judicial to :he executive department of the government, marked guilty by the judges and ury. Starting at that point therefore, I lave been diligently studying the record, A'hile industriously seeking information . ? / I oil nfhor umirnfie wHinh U1U rv 1UCIILC II Will (111 W illVI uvutvv^, f. ...V.. night conclusively prove to my mind that :he verdict of the court was an error and :hat, therefore the sentence pronounced by :he Court of Hustings, and affirmed by Virginia's highest court, must not be set aside jT commuted. "With an earnest desire to faitfully execute without fear or tavor the laws of the State, impartially to all, with the most profound sympathy for those upon whose learts this blow must fall, with a clear conscience that I am discharging my duty to ;he people of my State as my God has ?iven me strength to see it, I now write to you to inform you that I have not been tble to reach a different conclusion from :he courts, and therefore, the case of Thomis J. Cluverius is not one in my opinion :o call lor executive interference, either by he exercise of pardoning power or by computation of sentence." The Governor's decision was conveyed to ;he jail by Judge W. W. Crump, senior counsel, and his son, Beverly T. Crump, who icquainted the prisoner with it. Cluverius stood the ordeal with the same fortitude vhich has generally characterized his conluct since his arrest, and during his trial. \fter his counsel left him, however, it was plainly apparent that the awful news he had I heard had a marked effect, and that it was ; as much as he could do to maintain his wonted composure. Shortly after the counsel left the cell several reporters visited the jail and made an ; effort to see the prisoner, but when informed j of their object by the "death-watch," Clu! veriussaid, "I do not want to see anybody.' He was seated in an arm-chair with his elbows on his knees and his chin buried in his hands. Seeing the reporters at the door ol his cell he changed his position and endeavored to appear calm and collected, but it was i evident that the blow had struck home.
