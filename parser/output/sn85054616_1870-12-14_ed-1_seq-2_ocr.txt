The Sooth Carolina legiflature, on Wed nesday last, elected Stale Senator Robertson U. S. Senator. . . There are 14 vacancies in the Mississippi legiVIatnre, to be filled by special election on December 20th. Goldthwait, Dcrr.rx-iat, was last week elected U. S. Senator, by the Alabama leg islature. He bad one majority. The first bill introduced into Congress, iter its organization on Monday last, was one to f bolish the income tax. Hon. John W. Huston, a State judge, is mentioned in connection with the U. S. Senatorship, by the Democracy of Dela ware. Congressmen have already been figuring on the apportionment under the new census, an J have fixed the probable number of mem bers at 275. The Bostor. fiat 5ay3 "the Radicali in Buffalo County, Minnesota, elected a dead roan to the State Assembly, having no live tnan in the party they dared to trust." Just so ; but the deil Republican outrun the live Democrat, eh ? ""Bivalve bibulous party," in the cogno men given to the Delmonico dinner party if Free Trader?. Aprjaiate ; for no more tlimy set of tuckers erer assembled togeth er. They would suck the very life blood out of every industrial interest ia this coun try, if they had the power. The ''Kevcnua Reformers," it N paid, contemplate electing Mr. Farnsworth, of 111! oois, Speaker of the next House of Rep rcscntatives. That scheme, like the Demo cratic "revenue reform" scheme, will prove a complete failure. Republicans wont suf fer such calamities to be inflicted upon the country. t, The "Vounc Democracy" of Now York, have determined to send delegates to the next Democrat National Convention in op position to the Tammany oil fogies. This forebodes a real "Kilkenny cat fight," like tU at CViaricnton in lRftO, between the two factions!' the "harmoniou?." Well; let them go it ; it is n j fight of ours. The Republican Senatorial Convention, which nominated Mr. Lyndall, was assault ed by the Philadelphia Democratic roughs, while in session an outrage for which tlis party leaders arv responsible, as many of them were present at the time. In roughs and riots the Democracy put tlic:r trust lor the defeat of Mr. Lvndall. The Republicans of the First Senatorial district. Philadelphia, on Wednesday last, nominated lion. Joseph R. Lyndall, as their candidate to fill the vacancy occasioned by the tl-ath of Mr. Watt. Mr. Lynda'J is a first class man, aud bis U'luu-'ii'.xut !eo t:on is confidently anticipated. His Demo cratic opponent is R. P. Dcekert. Some of the Democratic papers in I Hi cois want the Democrats and 'Conserva tive" Republicans to combine and elect ex Secretary Browning to the U. S. Senate. The once great Iemocratic party "combi ning with a faction, 'is an admission of weak ness and decay that bodes continued defeat in the future. How the mighty have fa! len ! It is the general impression of Congress men that the resumption of specie pay ments is feasible within a year. Thus, the results of the rebellion, one after another are disappearing. With an honest collec tion ftf the revenues, and their proper dis bursement, the last vestige of our late na tional "unpleasantness" the national debt will also be wiped out in & comparatively few year. This will Lc the crowning good woik of the Republican parte. The Washington Patriot, Democratic, makes a pitiful appeal to all IVmocratic Congressmen to reduce the army at the present m-fs-rorj of Congress, on the ground that troops had been etrttioned in various cities during the recent election. Let Dem ocrats dismiss their rough-and-ready fraud- i ulent repeaters, and permit honest men to vote without molestation, and there will be no need to station soldiers convenient to the jolls for the protection of the ballot box. The Democracy of the Sixth district of Michigan elected Jabcz G. Sutherland to Congress. On the 17th of September Mr. Sutherland wrote a letter in which he said "in this Congressional district no party op posed to a tariff can ever hope to succeed, nor ought such a party to succeed. I shall consider it my duty if elected to do all 1 can 10 seeurc protection.'" Evidently Mr. Suth erland foresaid the collapse of tho ' Reve nue Reform" humbug, and hence he placed himself oil the Republican side of the ques tion. - ' The New York Tim' is worrying over a mathematical rtb!cm. it has thus far failed to ascertain how a Superintendent's clerk on a salary cf $1,300 has, since 1861, saved up about $300,000 without ttarving. If the New York Tinea will borrow the cal culation table on eiectious of the New York Democratic State Executive Committee, it will not only discover haw this may be easi ly acotmplt-hed, but will be surprised that the clerk has not saved up two or three kundred tbouswi mora. Democrats every where those table; why should uot the ikric to which the-7w' rtfers? The President's Message. We priut od the outside of to-day's pa per, the second annua! message of Presi dent Grant, and ask for h a careful perusal by our readers. It is a plain, sensible, business-like document, devoid of ail political sophistry and chicanery; discussing the subjects of present interest and future im portance to the American people, in a cool and deliberate, but in a Gnu and felicitous manner. The President makes a generous response to the sparks of Republicanism that have enkindled in France, calls attention to the wrongs committed on American citizens by the Spanish authorities in Cuba, argues warmly for the purchase of San Domingo, suggests a commission for the settlement of the Alabama claims, enters a protest against the seizure of American fishing vessels by the Canadian authorities ; and in conclusion urges a thorough enforcement of all laws, a faithful collection of taxes, economy in all departments of the government, prompt payment of all national obligations, a re duction of taxes and the tariff for tho good cf fbc greatest number, fair dealing with all naliou?, reform in Ir.',:an affairs and the civil service, and the freedom of the e'.cc'ivc franchise to all citizens irrespective of na tivity, faith or color. To show the spirit in which the message is received by the papers throughout the country, we append the following extracts : The Pittsburch Dispatch says : "The message must commend itselt very lavora-! .!,. , ,l-.;L.;.r ,,-.-,,n,f nil n,-ti.. .is a ! calm, high-toned, dignified document, show- j inir a statesmanlike grasp of the questions atiecttng the prosperity of the country, and a disposition on tho part of the President to do all in bis power to promote the well being of the entire people. A more dispas sionate or comprehensive document has not been submitted to Coneress for many years. Better suggestions for the future prosperity of the country could hardly have been made. If the same spirit shall pervade Congress as palpably controls the i 'resident, we shall have, between this ai d March next, the most popular session of Congress ever held." The New York Times says : "The mes sage transmitted yesterday by the President to Coneress is the best answer to those who insist that the mission of the Republican party is ended, or who impugn General Grant's fitness for intcrpretimr the wishes and promoting the inter.'ts of toe people. The policy set forth is at oru-e positive and practical" The Nkw Paktv. The Rochester Demo crat says of the "new party" agitation: "The movement stands confessed by its originators as nothing more nor less than an invitation to a largo section of tho Re publican party to commit suicide." The same paper continues upon the subject of revenue reform: "The Republican party i by its past actions and its promises f r the the future, the exponent a::d champion of! genuine revenue reform. It has done all that has been done in that direction. All the great measures for reducing taxes, passed by the last Congress, were opposed by the Democra ic members. Not a Democrat in the House of Representatives voted for the bill passed last July reducing the taxes $80,000,000. Not a Democrat voted for the lunding bill, which is designed to save $25,000,000 yearly on the interest of the public debt. So as to the other measures intended to reduce taxes. Let Republican ' revenue reformers' bs warned. They may rest assured that if they aid the Democracy in getting control of the Houc, that con trol will be used not only to 'block every scheme of the Protectionists,' as the World says, but to blof k every measure of the Re publicans, revenue refomi included." SiNC-fiAPi.T Mystkmous. The Dead Letter Oifiec is one of the most curiously interesting branches of the government, and the cause of it, or the necessity for such an institution, is a mystery. It 's impossible almost to conceive of the careles.-ness, stu pidity and ignorance by which tnoro than fourteen millions of Utters weio entrusted to the post o!tice in a single year, for which no destination could be found, in conse quence of inaccuracies, imperfections and fatal omissions in direction and upward of S.000 have no address whatever. And the mystery is the more rcmaikable when :i is consilerc-d that these letters contained money to the amount of at least $100,000, in small sums generally, and in checks, di-afto, etc., to the ctuottnt of $3,000,000 more. The property was of course returncl, or ui"it of it, upon information obtained by opening and examining the letters at the dead letter office. State Finances. It appears from a statement of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund that there was in the Trea sury, on the 30: h November, $1,230,995 82, of which $254, 10S 30 was applicable to the payment of overdue loans, relief notes and intetest certificates, in gold.

It is stated that the Democratic party in Kentucky is about to divide and form two sections the one liberal, recognizing the results of the war and conforming to them, to be headed by John C. Breckenridge and a few old time leaders ; the other section strictly Bourbonish, headed by modern Democratic mountebanks refusing to recognize results, and continuing, like Don Quixotte, to fight I windmills and other imaginary obstructions in their path to huipire. We can scarcely credit the announcement that Breckenridge belongs to and is leader of the liberate but if it is so. it is certainly the njost astonish ing thing that has occurred recently outside of the Mormon Church and Spiritualistic circle. The Government has collected $25,000 in Cincinnati from person who had made flc income rcUrus. Semi tliem right. ' The Postraaxter General's Report. The Postmaster General's report is con cise and clear in statement. Interesting in its statistics, and contains recomnieudations which commend themselves to alb He 6hows that the affairs of his depart ment are in a hea!thy,and,in fact, a steadily improving condition. Th revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, were $19,77-.-220 fi5, and the expenditures of all kinds S23.99S.P37 03, leaving a deficiency of only 4,220.016 98 as against a deficiency of $5,354,620 78 for tho fiscal year 1369. The incrrase of revenue for tfie rear 1370 over the year 1809 was $1,427,703 03 or 7.78 per cent., and the increase of expenditures $300,700 13, r.r 1.32 per cent., shoring a net increase in revenue of $1,127,003 SO. The incrceac in revenue for the year 1870 over the year 1SGS was $1,2CS,241 9S, or 5 57 per cent. The increase in revenue for 1S70, as compared with 1S69. was less than the increase for 1S09, as compared with 1SCS, by $021,199 90; and he increase in expenditures for 1870, compared with 1SG9, was less than the increase for 1369, com pared with 1808, by $000,832 72. The increa'e in tho issue of stamps, stamped envelopes and wrappers in thj fiscal year 1870 CT?r 1S09 was $1,395,068 50, ami the value of stamps and stamped envelopes lost, in the mails was $91 S 30, which is much less than the amount of similar losses in 1309. . lTi vmtrTr mr.nle tlit rrtm f e r. C 1,w t r. . , - ., , , '"crease the pay of railroad companies for carrying the mails, and supports the rccom mcndation by sound reasons. A contract between a government and its citizens is or should be free a transaction as a contract between private individuals, and the fact that many of the railroad companies find the pay so inadequate that they have no desire to tak the contracts for carrying the mails results in an inefficient performance of the work, which undoubtedly occasions a far greater loss to the Department than can be offset by the trifling saving of expenses thus effected, besides subjecting citizens to great inconveniences and annoyances through irregularities and delays in the delivery of the mails. He favors legislation to encourage tho re cstab!ihmcnt of American lines of trans Atlantic steamships for the transportation of the U. S. mails to Eitrnpe. On the subject of the flanking privilege, the Postmaster General does not seem to have changed his mind. Ho still favors its abolition, and expresses the opinion that if it were repealed the department would soon become self-sustaining, and in time prove a source of revenue instead of a yearly burden to the government. Ho recommends the adoption of tho sys" tern of "correspondence," or "postal cards," which is in use us in Great Britain and North Germany. These cards, de signed to be used for short, open mes sages by mail, are ruled on one side for the address, on the other for the communica tion, and are stamped. In Great Britain their price is a half penny each, which in cludes the cost of transportation and de livery by the post office. If they could be afforded at as cheap a rate in this country the system might become popular, as it would undoubtedly be, in a great many cases, both convenient and useful. The postal money order system has proved a success. The number of money order of fices has nearly doubled since the last fiscal year ; and over thirty four million dollars were, under this system, safely and promptly transmitted during the present year. The fees received for the issue of these orders amounted to nearly a quarter million dol lars, which w is an excess of ninety odd thousand dollars over the e.-peiie of carry ing on the system, so that while the money order branch of the service is a very great convenience to the community at large, it is tlso a positive source of revenue to tb? department. There are a number of other interesting tacts stated and suggestions made by the Postmaster General in connection with ibis system . The postage between Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy. Belgium, Switzerland and and the North German Union lias been reduced lrom twelve to six cents; which is especially important in the case of Great Britain and North Germany, between which countries ai;d the Uuncd States a very large amount of correspondence takes place. Di rect postal intercourse with Fiance 1 as been suspended since January 1. 1S70, inconse quence of tho abrogation of the postal con vention with that country. This, it is hoped, will be remedied by the government of France when peace shall be restored to that country. The document contains many other points of minor importance, but we omit noticing j them for want of space. Suffiec it to say j that the report is a most excellent one throughout, and we have no doubt the sug gestions it contains will be generally ap proved by Congress and the people. Declines to Contest. Hon. I). J. Morrell declines to co: test the election of Mr. Speer in the Seventeenth Congres sional District, lie says : " Justice to myself requires it. By hunt ing up the scattered fraudulent votes, over one hundred of which have been reported to me, I could doubtless make a successful contest, but being fully satisfied that my defeat indeed anything short of 1,000 ma jority in the district is due to the base treachery and debauchery of professed Re publicans, I should spurn to hold the seat at the cost of gathcring up the petty frauds of ur opponents. You are aware how much I have wished to get out of public life, and how much my own interests, and the interests of the Cambria Company, de mand it, and cannot blame me for accepting the present opportunity of doing so." Mr. Armstrong, in the Lycoming district, also declines to contest his seat, for nearly similar reasons to those given by Mr. Mor rell. This is highly honorable on the part of both these gentlemen.

Toe War News. The Prussians have taken Orleans.- Tin? defeat of the French army at Orleans was more severe than was anticipated, if the latest reports are reliable. Ten thousand French prisoners are reported captured, and the French army quite demo ralized. The Prussians evidently gained much the greatest success in the late battles. A few more such, and it will not be possible for the French to continue their defense. The speedy suppression of all arm id resist ance to the Prussians seems entirely pro bable. The French army of the Loire is reported retreating South. A forward move ment of the Germans toward Havre is said to be in progress. "Reports are current that Paris cannot hold out much longer. The secretary of Minister Wasbburne, it is said, predicts the surrender of the city in three weeks. Prince George of Saxony also tele graphs to the king, at Dresden, that further offensive movements on the part of the French arc impossible. He is, however, too confident. It is hardlv probable that Trochu will capitulate without making an- other desperate effort to cut through the German investing line. That he will fail, we have no doubt ; but that he will order four hundred thousand men to lay down their arms without one last struggle for victory, is scarcely to be believed. Cuba. If tbe report that Cuba has turned to South America for aid be true, there would seem to be some hope for her speedy deliverance from her troubles.

It has rl '. rf t li i tf - flu not iitni1 rAicn f fi r ? taken away very many troops from Spain. This drain cannot re endured much longer. and hence the desire on the part of Spain to find her way out of the difficulty as soon as possible.
