HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LISTEN TO ADDRESS AT WEBER CLUB Edward F. Trefz, Field Secretary of the United States Chamber of Commerce, Eloquently Sets Forth the Necessity of the Business Men of the United States Organizing He.Declares For an Americanism Which Is, Above Any Foreign Allegiance. ,t Nearly 100 business men and manu facturers of Ogden and Weber county, representing virtually every type of commercial institution in this part of the state, gathered at tho Weber club at noon today and listened to an im pressive and eloquent address by Ed ward F. Trefz, field secretary of th'e United States Chamber of Commerce, on tho themo, "The Necessity of a Thorough Organization of tho Busi ness Men of the United States." The address followed a luncheon and Secretary Trofz was introduced by President W. H. Wattls of the Weber club. Ho began his talk with a resume of the organization and ac complishments of the United Statos Chamber of Commerce and, in part said: "The United States Chamber of Commerce was organized for the pur pose of carrying the voice of the busi ness men, regardless of the kind of business or whero It is done, to con gress, and its policies are established by a referendum vote. Tho chamber now has 700 branch organizations, with 500,000 mombers, and hopes to one day havo a branch in every com munity of the country. "It Is also committed to the need of a national budgot for tho govern ment of the United States and to the securing of more attention from con gress to tho needs of the business Interests, large and small, In the way of legislation. We are the most "happy-go-lucky' nation In the world. We haven't any idea of what it Is going to cost, and we haven't any idea where the money Is coming from, but there aroj Just fifty-five systems of book keeping down there at Washington and only thirty-four men in the lower 'house,' who have ever lookeda pay roll in the face, which gives some Idea of why business, the backbone of the nation, takes a position of small Importance in congressional dollbera tione and Is so little understood. "When the war broke out, business was paralyzed. Transportation was at a standstill, because more than 4000 ships wore Interned in American ports, afraid to go out on the ocean. Railroads would not accept your ship ments of goods east In this crisis President Wilson called upon Presi dent Faye of the chamber of com merce to form a national committee of business men to relievo the situa tion. In twenty-two days sufficient confidence was restored by the work of this committee to bring conditions back somewhere near normal. Con gress, perhaps, could have done it in three months, but that would have cost a billion and a half dollars' loss. "There are three great forces In the country which concern the govern ment agriculture, commerce and la bor. Last year the government, through the department of agriculture, nonl 500 nnn nnfl fnr ntrHmilfurft nnri $5,000,000 for labor. The agricultural business of tlie nation during that time was estimated at ten billion dol lars. During the same period the commerce of the nation was worth twenty-two billion dollars. Yet tho United States government spent 140, 000 on th?e department of commerce only ?20,000 moro than Germany spends annually In New York to ox tend its commerce. In ten years Great Britain passed 1800 laws, only 31 per cent of which were for business regulation. In the same period the United States passed 62,500 laws, 82 per cent of which af fected business. The reason is that in this country for fifty years busi ness men havo been Indifferent to government, except when they wanted some special privilege. That condi tion came about because we were so busy building up.

In that time the wealth has Increased in this vast western empire of yours at tho rate of 260,000 an hour, or about $70 every time tho cloak ticked. "Twenty-seven hundred ships were noon carrying freight to foreign mar kets, relieving congestion at all points and, for tho present prosperity of the country, credit is largely due tho Unit ed States Chamber of Commerce." Speaking further, Mr. Trefz declar ed that the government was not on tlrely to blame for the "cross-purpose" legislation of congress with regard to business interests, but that the busi ness men themselves wore largoly re sponsible for it through their lack of lntorest In government affairs. As an illustration of this, he Bald that in one of the eastern states less than 40 per cent of tho voting population had visited the polls on a recent election and of tho number only 6 per cent were business men. "Tho average member of a labor union, or I. W. W. organization, he continued, can defeat an employer in an argument on political economy in five minutes and the 1) 1 of it Is' the business man doesn't know whether he Ib right or wrong." This condition, he contrasted with conditions in Germany and England, as taught by the European war, say ing part: "The war in Europe has taught us at least two things. Germany has taught us the value of organization. In the national chamber of commerce headquarters at Hamburg are statis tics upon every person in Germany over 7 years of age. They know whether that boy Is to become a wood cutter, a wheelwright or an Ironwork er. They go even further, and I ven ture to say that tonight, in the fllos of that chamber in Hamburg, there is a more complete statistical com pilation of commercial conditions In Utah than you havo in your own state, or in the United States. Have Learned Lesson. "From England wo havo learned the lesson of an intelligent concept of government. I care not what your opinion of England's conduct of the war may be, but I dare to declare that Balfour, Asqulth and Gey are tho greatest living trio of statesmen. At the same moment they are carry ing on a great war, financing Russia and France and maintaining the com mercial supremacy of the British em pire in every port in the world. The Englishman, oven in the smallest hamlet, knows his civil government. The British business man is a student of his governmenL "Tho only way tho nations of Eu rope can rehabilitate themselves after this war Is to sell their goods. And, naturally, the United States, being the richest nation, will offer ho best market for their goods. After tho war they will flood this country with goods made by labor to which they will pay the same wages they are now paying men In the trenches. The tariff should be so scientifically reg ulated that we can meet this condi tion adequately and correctly." In conclusion, the distinguished vis itor urged tho local business men to get together and do their Bhare of tho work that will bo necessary to bring about a nation-wide conception of government. "We must maintain the intogrity of tho law and tlie courts," he said, "so that every man will have an equal chance to prog ress and to develop his talents. We must Insist on the elimination of the hyphenated American' and the thor ough Americanization of tho people who como to our shores to make their homes. The time has come when any man who would put the prefix of any other nation to the greatest word in the English language, 'Amer ican', should be ostracised." "I am the son of a Gorman im migrant," ho said, "but I have yet to see the color of the man's eyes who will face me and call me a Gorman-American. I havo never seen tho time when I felt It necessary to wire to President Wilson, that I would support him. I am an American, and we should all be Americans In tho fullest senB of the word. For now, vlb we face tho bloody hour of Europe and turn to observe the peaceful calm in our own country, we can be proud and glad that we can all say, 1 am an American.' " "There .are as great problems be fore us here In America now as there have been In tho past, but the time has never been and will never be, when great Americans to solve thorn will bo lacking." At the conclusion of his talk, Mr. Trefz was complimented by hearty ap plause and tho thanks of tho Weber club was tendered to him by Presi dent Wattls. oo The Hippodrome and Dus tin Farnum, special matinees commencing tomorrow. 5c and 10c 5-reel Paramount, 6 acts of Vaudeville.
