A special corrssponrJentoC .the Cin. rinnati Enquirer -writes ft follows : WASHINGTON, December 6. 1 came to the Capital this day week. ago to witness the inauguration of the revolutionary nob that was call ed to meet here, for the ostensible pur poso of giving a welcome to the Iladf cal Congress, but for the real purpose of overawing tlie President,' and stiff ening the backbone of such Radical members as folt disinclined to ' depose that official from the office of Chief Magistrate. I expected to witness, a re-enactment of some of the scene of ta French Kevolntion, where the mob gave tone and direction to the Assem bly, and demanded and received' the life of the King., ' The mob did not tome off, and aim ply for the want of funds to bring the bad clcrnent hero. , The bad material expected to bo here by the managers did not como, because they had not the means to ooms:' The numbers that did come were too small to run so large a macbino, and hide the 'leaders; Im-iico it was determined to make the affair assume a Tery peaceful and in ifnifiennt appearance. A little show, a little pcakin, eating and drinking, closed tvbnt was intended to be ft very 'formidable and tnisebievons concern. Many I lnay eny a large majority cf the Radical members, on their advent here, Verb either opposed to the impeachment of tho President, or were very indiffercnton the suljoct. Doubts of the propriety,' and fear of the consequences, indisposed a major ity of them to meddle with the Presi dent bimj)oachminghim. But.sinco tho 'caucuses, ajjd withina, day or wo, there has been quite a change of tone among the Radicals, and the President i In more danger of Impeachment to day than be was on monday last; and tbo feeling in that direction isgrowing and strengthening. I am satisfied that fear alono of financial troubles will prevent , this . Congress deposing the President leforo the 1th' of .March next. . Mr. Johnson may ;iot be aware of Ibis, but it is nevertheless the true state of the case. The Radicals will try a guerrila war on the president for a white. They believe Uiey can scare him into sub mission to their demands. I know they believe him to" be destitute of physical courage, and hence they think that he will not have the moral courage oppose what they are pleused to cul' "the will of the people as expressed at the late State elections." Of course,' if tbey can accomplish their purposes with Mr. Johnson as President, it would be great foil y in them to risk all by at tempting his deposition. They will, therefore, commence by Tiiaking tho Presidential office of (is1 trifling account as possible. - They will curtail his pa tronage, limit his influence; and make 'all who desire Federal favors look more to Congress than ' the Exeotive for them. The Assembly of the JSjople. as some of them now call Congress,1 must now'be regarded as tho fountain of power and patronage, and the Pres-" i Jent of small account. That i simply pelting the boy in the apple-tree with sods.. If they do not bring bin. &wn harder missiles will be used. If the President will not yield to these guer rilla measures, the more formidable oi. e of impeachment will be resorted to regardless of consequences. For, murk you, if the President is firm, tbo Radicals cannot succeed in carrying out their programme. , lie will, to the cikT; be the lion in their path. Thoy must have negro suffrage tarried out. It is necessary to the life of tho Kadical, party. vfl It will die un less it secures negro' BuiTrago. Hon. Ren. Stanton, formerly ofOhio, .s.nd a leading - Republican, :. "demonstrated that fact in ft recent speech ftt Phila delphia. " He B')dv6d that the govern ing political party is in ft large- mlnori tj of the people of all the States, ex cluding the blacks; and that it is abso lutely neoessary to count the blacks on the side of the Republicans to give that political organization'" the moral prestige of including in its folds ft ma jority ol the whoU people. He, there fore, urges Congress to declare -very cHiserf of the Unfted States to be enti tle U like political rights and priv. leges . His views are those: of ft largo majority of Congress, affl as itrequlres a tnaioritr onlr of the members f tho House to prefer articles 'cf ' impch-that ment. Ton mar dereftdiUDoa it. J Mr. Johnson will be impeached nnlops he lots down, and allows Congress to have its own way in reconstructing the late "rebellious States." Wirl the Pi evident lot down? Can ho be frightened Into submission? TL ere are two, opinions'' prevalent- Thoie who know Mr. Johnson best sny that he will never yield an iota of his policy, nor t arry out any imposed on him that he believes to be unconstitu tional. If such is his determination, the Radicals can not succeed in carry ing out their programme, and will be compelled to depose him to succeed. Others believe that he will jield to the pressure and make his penco with the Radicals, by submitting to their policy after they shall havo parsed it over his veto; and this opinion is foanded on the fact that the ' President has not the moral courage to carry out bis own convictions, .us expressed in his official messages and popular addresses, by issuing a proclamation of general am nesty, and relieving the people of the South of military rule, not enforced on him by any law of Congress. There can be no doubt of one thing t: t Mr. Johnson is cither too timid or too indifferent to the porils'of his own situation for the crisis in which he is placed. . lie seems to act as if ho was not manter of the sitoatioa, and did uot know his own power. The" Radi cul s arc aware of tho dubious stato of Mr. Jolinson'smind,and will, therefore, crowd him the harder. , Iho poii.ts the Radicals will aim to carry out. are these, so far ns ' the w Southern unrepresented Strtesare con ccrned: ..... 1. Tho exiHting State governments Sonth must be declared ( to be illegal The States must be declared to bo .ter ritories. i. A law must bo passed called an enabling act," under which new govern rnouta lor eacu ct those states can be formed, the constitution of each of which muk Resubmitted to Congress for its npproval. 3. -That enabling act unist declare who shall vote for delegates to . the convention to mako tho new constitu tion. It must disfranchise those who took part in the war for the South, and declare all others to bo voters, without regard to race or color. That law carried out, it is supposed, would put the control of each of the unrepresented States in the lmnda of the Southern loyalists. And, if ii hhould happen that the freedmen should be influenced by their old. mas ters, and vote delegates not of theright stripe, Congress has the power to re ject the constitution framed by such delfates, though approved by those entitled to vote on it.' Such an enabling act will be passed, unless the Radicals are suro of secu ring the" next President. If sure of that, they will wait; for their whole ob ject is to perpetuate the power of their party. If not sure of that; then the counsels of Ren. Butler will be followed and the President impeached and de- poi osed, if not previously gotten rid of bv death; A joint resolution will be pased de claring that the votes of none of tho unrepresented States for ! elector of President and Vice President y 1868, shall be co anted (.That will be a nest egg for a new civil war. But there will be no necessity for it. if President Johnson, after vetoing the enabling act, and it shall bo passed over his veto, shall cary it out. If be will execute the law, the peoplo of tho South will hK at the mercy ot tno Kauicais. it he will not execute it, the law cannot be carried into operation without terrible scenes of blood, in which the blacks will be the main sufferers. The conclusion of my mind is, that tno luture is luilxit doubt ana uncer tainty; that there is no prospect of n speedy harmonising of tho' country; that strife and sectional bitterness will be increased; that mercantile embar rassments -will multiply; that trad will languish; that general distrust will take hold of the pubhc inind, and that a genoral financial and political crash will close the ' cloudy and con stantly darkening scene. 11 ' Some sensation has been created bv the unnouncement that Surratt,' one of the" alleged Accomplices of the assassi nation of Mr. Lincoln; has been arrest ed in Egypt, and is on his wuy to this louit'try. ' It is hoped that thelreport Is trie, tkoigh, many "doubt iVftssort ing that somtf follow who wants to J bo brought here at Ibe-pubUo expense has given out that he is Surtfttt.

John son with being accessory to the mur dor of Mr. Lincoln. If Surrat can be made a tool of for that parpose, no scruples will be mado tonso him by the Ben. Butlers, Forneys, Wades and that class of Radical leaders. Good men will rejoice that a regular judicial tri bunal will try Surrutt,whcre testimony can be sifted, and weighed by legal scales, and where such perjured wit nesses as Conover, and the pregctico'et Judge Advocate Holt, will have no in fluence on the court and jury. There i now some prospect of getting at the correct history of this horrid and de plorable transaction. . Theroison evident storm brewing between the Secretary of the Treasury and tho Radical Members of Congress. The latter accuse the former of playing into tho hands of JcvHuin gold und stock operators, and declare that more certainty must be imparted to the money market, or a financial crash and guat mercantile disaster cannot long be averted. The Secretary of the Ireasury is for a return to specie pay meets as soon an possible. - Leading Congressmen declare that specie pay ment will come of "itself whenever the country is . ready JVr. it, end , that to force it' will ruin Lundrcds of thous ands of peoplo by producing sudden fluctuation! in Varkct value?. There is'. no doubt about cue thing that ft healthy mercantile and trading busi ness cannot be oixliK.-ted on .an irre deemable and price fluct framing curren cy. I he secretary or tue lreasnry sees that, and wjints to come down tr the specie basis the basis of the final. cial operations of the whole world But he is chargetfwith workingitytftfy to aid his friends,Jay Copko and others. His power in that respect is immense, and if what is charged iu private cir cles against him is correct, he " should bo immediately removed. " ' Canada and the Fenians. The New York Freeman's Journal, that has alwayB opposed . Funianisni, says of the late proceedings of the Ca nadian Courts ; Do the Canadians dream so idly as to suppose that such a systom of out rage, under the mockery of lawi will be endured on the borders of the United States ? TFe can assnre them that hun dred of thousands of Americans who opposed the Fenian raid last summer, will appland and further a conquest of every foot of Canadian soil, if one man, of tho' late raidors is hangod by so' ex ecrable, and unjust a process as they have been subjected to in Toronto I Canada will, most assuredly, be inva ded, and overrun; and no judge, or juryman, or 'officer of any kindwho promoted; ohelpod on the conviction of theso prisoners, will be able to find any hiding place from Fenian ven gonuce, in Cauada or North America. The next two years' are to bo do voted, by American politicians, to se curing the Presidential election in No vember, 1SC8. The Feniau vote, and the vote of their sympathisers, is going to bo unscrupulously, sought by both parties. The States of New York and Michigan, and Illinois, with their Gov ernors, will strive to prove themselves more Feniun thaa the General Govern ment at Washington. Seward's obse quiousness to British interests, in the last raid, will not be repoated. In fact, a foreign war would be a God send, just now, to the Washington Government and no war would bo so popular, or so desirable, as one with England and her possessions. . , XTnjcrupulousnbHs is the modern law p '2 :,"...r.'.'
