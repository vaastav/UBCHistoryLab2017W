Financial legislation wilt command the most attention on the part of leaders in both houses and the' express confidence in the expectation that some meas ure will bo inscribed in the statute books before ilnal adjournment, after a oareful and thorough con sideration of the subjeot. The handsome and multi-colored costumes of the hundreds of women who crowded the Senate galleries made a very brilli ant netting for the sombre gather ing which slowly asscm bled in the chamber below. While there were many hearty greetings, nu merous cordial congratulations and introductions of now Senators it was notlceablo that in almost every instance some reference to the death of Senators Morgan and Pettus or somo expression of re gret for the absence of Senator Spooner gave a sober turn to tho conversation, and there was. less laughing and joking than is usual at the opening Congress. The President's annual message to Congress read in both houses yesterday, and the last but one that he will transmit, unless re elected is considered to be, on tho whole, a dignified, comprehensive view of the Nation's affaire. The President's recommendations gen erally on governmental matters are in harmony with his well known ideas, and he urges upon the people to remember that the material oondition of the country is inherontly sound and that the great mass of the country's busi ness is conduoted with honesty. Nothing that Mr. Roosevelt has advanced has earned more re spect for his statesmanship than his work for the conservation and developement of the country's natural resources' which subject he discusses in a masterly fashion in his annual message and points the way to National wealth by the exercise of forsight and frugality. The message is considered to be replete with suggestions for im provement full of authentic in formation and a document which every American should read. The concensus of opinion among leading Senators and. Representa tives that there is absolutely no need for emergency legislation be cause witbin the next thirty days there will be a greater amount of money than the banks can con veniently handle. It is the belief that a contraction of business will oocur all along the line, not seri ous but quite sufficient to release a considerable portion of borrow ed capital now employed and the result will bo that the back resorves will grow rapidly. The leaders in Congress insist that financial legislation is too Important a sub ject to be dealt with hurriedly and the intention is that no measure will be enacted before Spring. Speaker Cannon has announced the membership of the Committee on Banking and currency as fol lows: Messrs. Fowler of New Jer sey, chairman; Prince, Illinois; Calderhead, Kansas; Pqwers, Maine; MoMorran, Michigan; Weoms, Ohio; McCroary, Penn sylvania; Knowland, California; Waldo, New York; Hays, Califor nia; Weeks, Massaohusotts; Bur ton, Ohio; Lewis, Georgia: Pugo, Louisiana; Glass, Virginia; .Gill espie, Texas; James, Kentucky; Crawford, North Carolina, and MoIIenry, Pennsylvania. Whatever may be the aottoa of this committee, the expectation is that the real financial bill of tho session will come from the Sen ate, and that Senater Aldiich will later in tho session report such a measure and seoure its passage. That the tariff will not be a live issue during the present session ol Congress goes without, saying as Mr. RooBovelt, and the leaders of the party are agreed that the best tisae for revising the tariff is lmi mediately after a Presidential elootlon as at other times It is al most impossible to get man to treat the subjeot from' tbe'stand polnt of the pub'Uo good. ,.

There 1b every indication, however that when the measure 1b referred to the Committee on Finance it will not again sea the light of day. Senate leaders deolare that Con gress will never delegate its auth ority to readjust the tariff sched ules to any commission of experts and it is reoalled that President Roosevelt in one of hie early mes sages, recommended the creation of a tariff commission, suoh as is now suggested by Mt.
