Bet ter see us m Bicknell & Harris Berea, Kentucky THE HIGH COST Or LIVING Soma Reasons Therefor. Tho high cost of living is caused to somo extent by not taking caro of the little things. It is not how much ono makes, but how ho takes enre of what he has. By saving the little things wo arc ahlo to bo prosperous. Of my friends, I have often no ticed how two of them lako care of their clothes. Ono of tho girls gels a new dress. When she goes to tho kitchen to work she docs not change the dress. It is soon soiled and not lit for wear. She never hangs tip her clothes, no mailer how new or what they cost. The other girl has her work dress es, Sho never goes to work in her good clothes but keeps them nico for proper occasions. Everything is so well taken care of that her clothes look new for Ihrcc of four years. The girl is a picture of neat ness and does not spend half the money that the other girl docs. I have known boys who were, working hard to get an education, who wore Ihelr best clothes when they were doing farm work or dig ging in a ditch. Children arc not taught to lie saving enough. Money means no more to somo of them than water. They do not caro how many tablets and pencils they waste; their pennies aro wasted in tho chewing gum habit. If they were taught to take care of pennies tho dollars would lake caro of them selves; if they were taught to savo in youth it would grow on them as they got older. Buying cheap things also adds to tho high cost of living. One good dress is belter than a half dozen cheap ones. There aro some who like to make a show by having many cheap clothes. They cannot be worn long and never made over. While if one buys good material it can bo made over for several years,, and it lasts longer and looks better than cheap goods. Buying things in tho extreme fashion, which will only last one season and cannot bo made over for the next season, is another waste. That is ono of the things to watch when wo mako our purchases. Most people have sufficient income if they would take caro of what they pet. The "cash system" is ono of the best ways to reduce the high cost of living. When you pay cash you will not buy so much. Accounts will come due and they aro always larger than you expect. We should never buy things that wo do not need. I have a poem that has often kept me from buying unless I could pay. This is the poem: "Never spend a cent unearned Never gamble on tomorrow, Hero's a lesson man has learned Very much to his sorrow. Keep your heart and purpose true Never go above your speed." Etta L. Moore. THE TEACHER AND THE TEMPER ANCE QUESTION (Continued from Pare One.) increase their endurance arc tho first to fall out and drop by the.way side. This was proven conclusively by British campaigns in Egypt and South Africa. Alcohol has no food value and therefore cannot produce energy or increaso elllcicncy. It does not aid digestion as many people believe it does. It has been shown by careful experiments that tho presence of alcohol in the stomach, even in very small quantities, interferes with digest ion. Moro timo is required for the stomach to do its work when alcohol is used with tho food. An investigator discovered that 100 minutes aro required, for tho stomach to digest tho food to a cer tain state. When n mixture of wa ter and 5 per cent of whiskey, bran dy, or gin was laken with tho food tho digestion did not seem to be in terfered willi; when 10 per cent ol the liquor was put into tho walo the stomach required 15 minutes moro time to do tho same amount of work; when ?0 per cent of liquor was ndded tho stomach required 35 minutes more time; when 30 per cent was added, 80 minutes moro were needed, and when 40 per cent was put into tho water it took 30Q minutes for tho stomach to do tho same amount of digesting it could do in 100 minutes when no alcohol was present. You must novor sup pose that it is a safo thing to "take a little wiuo for the stomach's sake" along with tho food. Alcohol is a poison that interferes with digestion and lowers efficiency and should be classed as such. My Next Point is Alcohol and Crime. Now you must not supposo for o moment that I am intimating that the men who drink aro all moro or less criminals. You know as well as I know (hat there are plenty of good and upright inon who drink occas ionally. Somo of your best friends and some of miiio do so and we know that thoy are good peoplo. But it is important that you know something of tho relation of alcohol to crime and I shall givo a number of plain simple facts and let you draw your own conclusions. High authorities cslimato that from 75 per cent to 00 per cent of crimo committed in civilized coun tries aro traceable to alcohol. Whether this estimate is loo hlgn or too low wo cannot say, but we do know that many of the l?3t deaths by violcnco in the stalo of Kpnlucky last year (1012) were duo to alcohol. Perhaps all of you can recall tragedies that would never have happened if tho men had not been drinking. (Continued next week.) MADISON COUNTY Harts. Hart, Dec. I.
