Oe to be Editer"Al or B==tos Dprt ntmerding to tenoe or pesuese A Loog Contest Edism. That Isthmian canal, so long dreamed of. thought of, wished for and worked for, is at last "in sight." The Hay-PauncefOte treaty is on the eve of ratification, and following that in reasonable time should be, and presumably will be. the necemary legislation by Congress for putting in the first spade on the great work. The rest will be mere business detail. The method of prosecuting the work, and the length of time necessary for its completion, will call for sound judgment and gAod management, but there need be no great uneasiness on that score. Government contracts are not always promptly executed, and government estimates of cost are not always accurate. But as this undertaking is exceptional in every way, let us hope it may prove so In this way as in other ways. The piercing of the isthmus has been so lor~g contemplated that familiarity with the topic has in a measure dulled the popular appreciation of its tremendous importance. It will prove to be the greatest achieve inent in the cause of progress of modern times. It will complete and crown that chain of feats which 'has made of this world a neighborhood of men. Cutting across lots has been the order of the day for a full century; and the annihilation of thousands of miles of sea voyage on the passage from the occident to the orient with the occident the seat of commercial power. and the orient just waking up to the advantages of new systems and en joyments-is something the whole world Could afford to celebrate by a series of formal fetes. When the canal is opened and the first ship enters for passage through, maybe the President of the United States will by arrangement press a button, and set off the steam whistles and the bells "from Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral strand." That will be a noise which. if less notable and far less musical than When the morning stars sang together, will yet be a truly big time in the history of this world of ours. Congratulations are in order, and should be dispensed with a liberal hand. Only the continental railroads of this country, and their tools in and out of Congress, are de nled a share of the universal gratitude. Democrats and republicans alike in the United States have wrought to the great end. Englishmen and Americans, after years of wrangling and playing at cross purposes, have put aside all differences and difficulties. Presidents of the United States, without distinction of party, have favored the enterprise. And last, but not least, the names signed to the treaty are those of as capable and patriotic men as have ever served their respective govern ments in high office. John Hay and Lord Pauncefote deserve well of their country nen, and are assured of permanent fame. No American or Englishman of this gen eration has set his hand and official seal to a diplomatic document of so much gen eral and lasting interest. Next Yesr's EneamPment. The decision of the Grand Army of the Itepublic to hold Its next annual encamp zrent in this city follows the line of nat Ural selection. Washington is becoming ncre definitely each year the logical city for the assemblage of great national organi Nations, especially those of a patriotic char acter. It offers a maximum of historical interest and its associations are all such as to endear it especially to the veterans of the civil war. Next year's encampment will occur Just ten years from that extraordl pary assemblage which brought the Grand Army to Washington for the first time in its history. Probably never before or since has there been such a gathering of old soldiers. Elaborate -and costly provision had been made not only to entertain all who would naturally attend the encamp ment, but to secure the attendance and comfort of veterans who without aid would be unable to visit the capital. The pur p's., which was executed with exceptional suiccess. was to bring to this city the full est possible attendance of the old soldiers, who had not thus formally visited the led eral city since the grand review in 1865. The capital city has always felt proud nif that encampment, as doubtless has the Grand Army itself. It was a red-letter oc 'casion in the history of both the city and the organization. The District cannot hope ti repeat next year what was done ten years ago, The elaborate entertainment of Y~a!l involved a local cost which cannot lie easily computed, in view of the direct violation by Congress of the organic act in providing the entertainment fund ap .propriation. That disastrous form of ap propriation will never be duplicated with the consent of the people of Washington, The Grand Army will find here a conven tIn city of unique interest in itself; and the veterans will be greeted with that hearty hospitality which the capital ex tndis to all assemblages of American citi zens as honored guests within Its gates. I ' Washington would be grateful for a scientific discovery to the effect that homi eblail impulses are caused by a germ which can be exterminated. N) doubt the Porto Ricans mean well, but their Ideas on the labor question ap jpear to be very much out of dale, Richard Croker will let the other people reform, and wall for a chance to recoup. Bishop Ketuald ad the Frae. A t a recent missionary conference i'eld in Rochester, New York, a bishop of the Episcopal Church referred in severe terms to the conduet of the Spanish friars in the Philippines, This has aremed stiahop Me Qjuald of the Jboman Catholie diocese of Rochester. who, In a reply, uses the 1o1 lowing language: ''I have certain knowledge that the con d1 uct of the friars in the Philippim. Iu=1z91s can be fairly compared with the cnduct 01 the ministers in the bisho's own church or in any other church in ths ountry. It is false to assert that education was not given to the grest aib'of these pepe. They had a morality Tht I am afraid te will never know eaein einee the introduc tion of American civilisation." Bishop McQuaid owes it to himself to at once give the muble the beasent of tis "ertain knowledge' which puts the friars in the Philippines on a par for character with the ministers and priests Ia the United. States. It is wholly at variamc with testimony from a thousand other sources, and all within the pale of his own church. Has Bishop McQuald never seen Senate doenm. N. lA et the second ser sion of the Fifty-sigth CnrsT H. ought to get a ewpy and lead 1ts three bundred priated pagis with esre; ougt to eserve that these who degene se ali Romn n~teUn and hate o aht ei any otheg ef-m ,a They ak1 ithe intereste of these fih, In the hope or seern= pastors ate Wis wRt not bele thser pretestlA They -rO N rm "i that the see.n..e trirs sha not resume their charges; and the question for both the church &ad the state in the Philippines is to secure peace On this score by the institutionet a =w -order of things. It will thus be seen that the accusers of the friars are those who at .one time sat under their spiritual minttrationa. Pre sumably they must have the best of rea son" tr their ompatae for people, as rule. are slow to move where the good name of their religious communion is In volved. But. acceeiag to the sworn state ments of these men, conditions were such at the time of the anmas=a downfall in the Philippines that the lives of many of the friars were an abominatien in the sight of their parishioners. The comgainants there fore embraced the irst opportunity to make known their grlevances, for the pur pose of having the foul nests cleaned out. They remain Itoman Catholics, but they ask for spiritual guides who live up to the requirements of their sacrok calling. If they are looking to America for an example of what they desire in the way of successful church government their eyes are fixed in the right direction. Churches of all denominations thrive In this free country, and the Roman Catholic Church shows greater prosperity under the stars and stripes than under any other fiag that floats. American-bred priests would speed ily solve the Phflippine problem as It Is complicated by the Spanish friars, both in the energy of their labors and in the cor rectness of their lives. I I I Books for the Publio Library. The District appropriation bill for the current fiscal year should have carried with It an appropriation for the purchase of books for the Public Library In such num bers as to ensure the opening of the new building with a respectable show!ng on the shelves. It was clearly pointed out that such an anticipatory provision would pre vent an embarrassing situation later. But Congress last winter Ignored the plea. The library building will be finished some time In May. The regular District appropriation bill. in all probability, will not be passed much if any before the first of June. It may not be passed even until after the close of the fiscal year. as has heretofore happened on occasions. In any event, the money for the new books imperatively needed for the library cannot be had In hand for at least live months through this measure. This means that it will be impossible, unless some other way is found to meet the case. to open the new building with a decent showing of books on the shelves. It Is strongly urged by the librarian of Corgress, out of his own wide experience, that every effort be exhausted to brevent the opening of the building-which in this 3ase is al most tantamount to the inauguration of the library Itself-with bare shelves. Such a spectacle would be humiliating to the pecple of the District, a reflection upon Congress as the District's legislature and a check upon the development and the, popu larity of the library. In order to provide the volumes necessary for the proper opening of the building the trustees have asked for an appropriation of $40,000. and the Commissioners have ap proved that estimate and forwarded It to Congress. It is assured that several months of hard work will be necessary to expend this money properly and to cat alogue the books. A mass of uncatalogued books will be of no value to the readers. So the money should be appropriated im mediately, unless Congress is willing to permit the opening of the new building with a discreditable showing of empty shelves. This can be done by means of the urgent deficiency bill, which Is usually the frst of all the supply bills to be passed. It Is likely that this measure will become law shortly after the Christmas holidays, and the book fund for the new library building would thus become available In season, with hard work by a competent force of cataloguers. for the opening In May. The Public Library committee of the Board of Trade has recommended this course as the only way now available for avoiding a humiliating spectacle next spring on the occasion of the opening. The course is urged, indeed, by every consideration of pride in the capital and this new institu tion, which has already, even with its scanty stock of books and Its Inadequate equipment, demonstrated its great useful ness to the people of the District. New York Sprucing Up. Things are moving in New York along the line of moral betterment, even in ad vance of the assumption of office by the fusionists. The other day a police captain was convicted of neglect of duty and he was subsequently dismissed from the force in consequence of this action. He was one of the most effective of- the Tammany cap tains In working the great graft. Deputy Commissioner Devery is on trial for some of his tyrannical actions toward the men who refused to bend the knee to the ma chine. Captains of the force are actually raiding pool rooms and other joints without being forced to do so by the anti-vice so ciety. The latest raid resulted In the cap ture of the "policy king," whose connec tion with Tamnmany has been close In the past. Enough evidence was collected, it was afterward reported, to send a large gang of the gamblers to prison, and per haps to afford clues to the principals in the great game, which it is known embraces some of the leading exponents of the Tam many system of government. At this rate Mayor Low and District Attorney Jerome will enter office with the reform movement already under working headway. It would be a striking commentary on the mutability of life in large cities for these purifiers to find their paths eased for the regeneration of New York largely in consequence of the eleventh-hour repentance or forced virtue of the heelers and their official allies. Illinois has developed some strongly con trasted types of statesmanship. As be tween the acrimonious Altgeld and the bland Billy Mason, it has been clearly demonstraed that it pays to be good-na tured. Congress is once more requested to take up the question of so timing Inauguration day that there will be a chance of stririmr a happy medium between snowstorms and aonstrokee. Tom L. Johnson has not gotten far enough along with his street ear reform to devote much time to consideming what the big steam raiway combine may do with rates. The amiale feettag omet prevent an Inspection of the canal treaty to make sure that Great Britain has mot retained some sweeping Vantages by mistake. Unand hopes that affais in South Afri ca wftA presently permit the ulaim that there is glery emongh to go 'round. The Ohio republica=s have enough funds on hand to oenver the assurance that the party Is in its normal coditon. The Panama Canal scheme has a record bad enough to sugest the propriety of en tire self-effacement.

It is posble that a oNgrMnIse may be effected6 with the -psngers lauded at Montauk Point. which lies at the extreme eastern end of Long Island, and railroaded to New York wfth a minimem of delay, whle the steamers carry the freight on to the city docks more leisntely. The topogra phy of Long Iland permits a practically indedeite duplication of tracks throughout its length of approximately 120 miles. Trains could be run between the landing place and the city in two hours, under favorable conditions, while the trip from Montauk to the city by water Would re quire at le*At four tirnet as loug. in the case of the fatest steamers net counting the delays in docking in the crowded river.

The project Is more attractive In view of the opportunity which the tunnel scheme affords of laiding tourists in the center of New York. without crossing ferries or bridges or leaving the cars. Passengers could be dispatched from Montauk Point to practically all points north, west or south for continuous travel. The statehood fight down In Indian terri tory and Oklahoma is growing interesting. The Oklahoma people want the two terri tories merged into a single state, pointing out that they would make one compact and populous commonwealth. The other folks, however, do not desire to lose their iden tity, fearing that Oklahoma would get the name and the credit of the statehood. They feel rather jealous of the newer territory anyhow, it having been carved from the borders of the old organization. The propo sition to unite the two into one state is likely to command strength In Congress, despite the threat of the Indian territory people to fight any statehood movement on this basis. It is to be questioned whether there will be any pronounced public sup port of the two-state project. The donations will go unselfishly on in spite of the fact that a great many more library patrons will call for "The Pirate's Bride" and "Pretty Estelle's Reivenge" than for the "Life of Andrew Carnegie." S_0 Washington would be grateful if some of the detective ability which has so fasci nated the public would step out of the story books and get down to business. The efforts of Constantinople journalism to keep up the picturesque interest in the Miss Stone case are developing a wealth of oriental Imagination. The monotony of war news from South America Is relieved from time to time by a variation in the names of the partici pants. European monarchs find it necessary at times to take off their regalia and get down to real work, figuring on tariff prob lems. Chicago has some difficulty in deciding an occasional spat as to whether a judge or a newspaper man is entitled to the last word.
