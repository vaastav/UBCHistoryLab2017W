The giddy old tiling! THE BUBEATJ OF MINES. The recommondation of President Roosuvclt. in his message to Congress in favor o the creation of n Bureau of Mines under the control and direc tion of the Secretary of tho Interior, will moot with henrfj' rcsponso through out, all this Western country, and very hkcJy will bo favorably racoived throughout tho country at large, as it certainly ought lo be. Those who op poso it will be, the windy speculators, the shnrpors, nnd tho complacent, self suffieiejil absorbers of money in Xcw York City who do not care anything about any American industry, except as they can exploit it to their own advantage. A Bureau of Mines prop erly conducted would give the Amer ican people a great and trustworthy view of the vrholo mining situation at all times, nnd would liavo surveys, rec ords, and geological investigations on file that would provo valuablo to the I The Bureau of Mines would naturally i and speedily grow far be3'ond tlio lim i its outlined by President Roosevelt in his mcssago. nis idea i3 that this bu reau should "include statistics, make investigations in all matters pertaining to mines, and particularly to tho acci dents and dangers of tho indusUy." That surely would bo one important function of the bureau, but far aud i away beyond this it should have know edge at hand with regard to all the important initio deposits of the county-and details of all operated mines. It should havo special experts investigat ing mineral deposits, proving their ex tent and quality, and indicating by tho j scientific explorations and surveys of mineral deposits, including metals of all kinds, carbonaceous deposits, hydro carbons, oils, tho situation of mineral bearing strata, and everything now mined of value, or . that could bo mined of value to the pcoplo at larue or to the country. And we should ex pect to sco. this bureau grow into a Dopartment with a Secretary at the head of it. precise! as tho Department of Agriculture qrew from the small be ginning of a division .in tho Interior Department, then a Bureau, and finally a separate Department, with a Secre tary at tho head a member of the Pres idential Cabinet. The limited function outlined for such a bureau b' the President would certainly be useful, but naturally there would grow from it a wonderful in crease of opportunities and usefulness. Tho geological survey of tho country would naturally bo found under the control of this Department of Mines when it is created, nnd that is a matter of tho very highest importance to tho whole country. The work of tho geo logical exports is especially valuable in tho mining industry; and a thorough ecological survey of the whole country would be of immense benefit to All. The idea will no doubt develop from the Bureau of Mines into tho Department of Minos far morn rapidly than any other bureau has so devclopnd in the history of the country: because, when tho Bureau of Aline? is opened it will be so thronged with business, with the addition of matter that is no appropri ate to tho work of such Bureau, that it will speedily bo found that it is a mere beginning of tho great work lo bo done, lint tho fact that- it is a beginning is the main point, aud so we woliSbmc the President's suggestion and aro sure that it will bo supported loy ally throughout tho mining regions of the country, and should b by every body. And there is no reason why it should not take actual form at tho present session of Congress. A 

QUEER RECOMMENDATION. One of the most surprising sugges tions thatvhas boon made in roecnUtitues in' connection with politics, is that found in President Roosevelt 's message recom mending that Congress make appropri ation of funds for the legitimate ex penses of each of the great National parties; "an appropriation amplo enough to meet tho necessity for thor ough organization of-machincry, which requires a large expenditure of money." It will be extremely difficult to con vince the country oi tho propriety of such expenditure of the public money as this. Asido from the fact that it 'would be an open bid for the formation of an immense number of so-called Na tional parlies, it would bo a constant temptation on the part of tho party in power to appropriate to itself large sums of money, and hold tlic opposition party down to a starvation basis. Obviously it would not do to appropriate tho money merely to the "two great parties," because any National party is just as much entitled to such recog nition and appropriation as any other. The Populist part.v, the Socialist party, the Social Democrats, the Prohibition- J ists, mid a multitude of other parties that would no doubt be organized upon the creation of any such a custom on the part of Congress, would speedily make demaud upon tho treasury. And it would bo difficult, even with the np- I propriation made, lo restrict the free dom of giving by zealous party men who could afford it. Tho likelihood that such an appropriation would diminish tlio usual campaign funds materially is -not great. By the very terms of the President's recommendation that nothing but the most necessary campaign expenses' would be met by the proposed Congres. sionnl appropriation, there would spring up right there and at once a wranglo as to what comprises tho necessary cam paign expenses; and it "would be dif ficult to say that ono party should have more llma'anothcr. It ivould hardly do to say that because one party had a 1 very largo vote that therefore its es pouses were greater and that it should havo moro money than tho parties cast ing a smaller vole; tho fair argument 'would follow that with proper recogni tion, tho voto would bo larger. Wocan sco roadily that such appropriation by Congross would bo a trcmcndouB factor in croating now National parties of va rious kinds, but othorwiuo wo aro not nble to boo whore it would do any good or would amount to anything in tho pur ification of politics, tho keeping down of campaign expenses, or tho prevention of thoso who were supposed to bo espec ially interested in tho policies of any party from holding up corporations for what might bo supposed lo bn "a fair contribution," and of gotting tho "fat." Wo can hardly imagine Congress pay ing any sorious attention lo this recom--mendation of President Roosevelt. i 

SENATOR HOPKINS ROUTED. j Papers from Illinois aro at band showiug the encounter at Piano, Illinois, between Senator Hopkins and Elder Cooper. It appears that the proceed ing's wore at the Maramcch club; that Elder Cooper read certain portions of tho Snioot testimony in which Smoot declared his belief in tho divinity of tho revelation commanding polygamy. Hopkins doniod Cooper's claim, and de clared that no such tostimony had been delivered. Elder Coopor thereupon quoted from the record, showing .that ho was exactly right nnd that Hopkins, iu denying tho officinl procedure and testimony as printed, was clearly in tho wrong. That is to say, Hopkins did not know what ho was talking about, and wjien ho denied tho record he was speedily put to rout. ' Tho proceedings occurred at a ban quet of tho Maramcch Club, at which the Piano church ladies served an elab orate menu. In his remarks before the club, Senator Hopkins repeatod what ho had ea'ul about. Smoot being a polyga- I mist, and claimed that Smoot "has done more tliau any other ono hundred men iu Utah to blot out tho practice of polygamy," and all that sort of rub bish. In this Hopkins modified his pro Sinoot claim by ninety per cent. In his speech to tho Senate, Hopkins said that Smoot. had done moro than any thou sand other men to beat down polygamy. lildcr Cooper replied at once, being fully prepared. Ilo literally and abso lutely demolished Hopkins for donying tho verified testimony that Smoot had delivered. Hopkins, in a burst of fraudulent indignation at beiug as sailed falsely, had got away with the situation until Elder Cooper caino back at him and road tho record, which ut terly confounded Hopkins. It is really remarkable that. Senator Hopkins would put himself in such a position as he did at Piano. Ho gavo every candid hearer tho impression that he was a fakir, a pretender, a fraud. Ho bolstered his caso up with false Jioods and with assumptions that had no possible foundation, just as ho had dono iu his speech in the Senate in Snioot "a favor. Of course Snioot. has never said anything against polygamy; of course ho testified to tho divinity of the polygamy revelation; of course Smoot never delivered any anti-polygamy speech; he would not dare to de liver any such speech now. The whole foundation for Hopkins's argument is based ou utter falsity, and it is sur prising that he has tho effrontery lo go before tho people of Illinois with his false pretenses, unfounded assumptions, and direct falsehoods in support of his wretchedly bad case. TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL, BOTH Notwithstanding tho fact that it has reiterated it time nnd lime over, tho Doscrot Is'cws on Monday returned to its old falsehood in denial of the pro phetic claim to tho right of universal dictation. So many iiuics have wo ex posed the utter untruth of tho News in this matter that it seems almost un necessary to tako further notice of it; but tho evident vicious intention of the anti-Christian organ to deceive the pub lic justifies tho following quotation from its editorial columns, together with our subsequent proof and comment: Finally. It Is not true that Prcfeldent Joseph F. Smith has claimed the divine rljjht to "rule this people In all things." Of course, the Dcseret Nows remem bers well enough that Joseph F. Smith 's own uttorances are in direct contradic ! linn of its entirely stupid assertion; but I that, would in no wise deter it from ro peating a threadbare falsehood. Tt knows that President Smith has de clared in a sermon that "any man who says you can direct me spiritually, but not temporally, lies in the presence of God that is, if he has got intelligence enough to know what ho is talking about." A charge of falsehood, in view of these two contrnry statements, must necessarily Iio against either the Dcs eret News or Joseph V, Smith; and as lo which of tho two should bear the, onus of the offending, there are already so many black marks against both that a fow more ou the account of either would make but little dill'crcncc. Then there is the explanation Which President Smith very recently mado to tho Pittsburg Times, which wo copy as fnllnwa- Our church differs from other churches, In that it looks after tho temporal ns well as tho spiritual wclfaro of Ita peo ple. losepli F. Smith is the supreme head of the church; his word is final in all things; whether the matter in hand lie of a religious, or a business, or a politic al nature. Smith's decision can not be appealed from. Logically, then, the president of the church docs "rule this people in all things." The Dcseret News will not deny that he is tho final authority in the church upon religious questions, so that it must admit that ho rules in this particular. Tho prophet lias warned his peoyde that they must refuso to sell lauds or cucourauu Gen tiles, which is a temporal matter; ho hns threatened to crush certain of his followors if they persisted iu engaging in an enterprise which canto into com petition witli tho business of n church corporation, which is also temporal; ho has ougaged the funds of tho church (colloctod solely for religious purposes, according to tho understanding of the contributors) in commercial couccrns, which is another temporal pursuit; and tho volumo of ovidonco in this respect is almost inexhaustible. So that tho News can not mako consistent or truth ful denial that the prophet also rules in tin's particular. Wo can show by church publications that Joseph l' Smith has repeatedly directed the votes of his followers to an object desired by himself, which is certainly )olitical; that ho has authorized ecclesiastical supportorB to instruct tho pooplo in tho massing of their uuitcd strength upon ono party or another, according to his own schemes, which is likowiso a mat ter political; that ho procured tho elec tion of two United Statos Senators in Utah, which also comes under tho head of politics. Bosidcs, wo can show by tho columns of tho Deaerct News itself (sco tho issuo of December C, 1000,) that Joseph P. Smith spoke upon poli tics in the Tabernaclo, and that during his sermon ho made refnronco to tho matter of selection of desirnblo men to voto for; and that upon this subject he said : When I get the- word of ths Lord ns to who Is tho right man, will I obey It. no mattor if It docs como contrary to my convictions? Thorc is no end of proof that Joseph F. Smith claims the "divine right, to rulo this pooplo in all things." If bo did not, ho would ho proceeding to cast aside the most cherished special privi lege that has boon claimed by himself and all tho other pretended prophets of Mormondom, who havo gone beforo him. To do that, ho is both too great a fanutic and too selfish, of ppwer and pelf. THE 

FLITTLNG OF THE FLEET. In his message to Congress President Roosevelt, enters upon an olaborato apol ogy for his order of sending the fleet of battleships to the Pacific. The rea sons ho urges aro plausible enough, and probably no ono would feel like find ing special fault with them. At the same time it is clear that, tho real thing to do is to have as large a fleet as is necessar, both in the Atlantic and in tho Pacific; for if we should havo any trouble with any nation of Europo requiring tho presence of the fleet in tho Atlantic, thcro would not be time fo draw from the Pacific the necessary reinforcements. This is ob vious under the present conditions. Tho voyage around Capo Horn by a war fleet is an arduous, a doubtful, a risky trip. We havo not had tho experience bo far of sending a war fleet around tho Horn. It may well be that thorc will be damage and loss in the trip as ordorod. It is true that tho Oregon mado her grent'voyagc from San Fran cisco to Florida around tho Horn with safety, and that the speed was admira ble. It is hardly to be expected, how ever, iu sending a whole fleet on that same voyage, that, all the vessels will escape as well as did the Oregon. Even when tho isthmian canal is finished, there would still bo scant time, and thore would certainly be great risk, in seuding vessels from the Pacific to the Atlantic' in caso of need. And if the policy shall bo continued of keeping only a few ships on the West coast; oar West const will be defonselcss in case of attack from any great nation on tho Pacific. Groat. Britain overmatches us all the time there, and so does Jap an; but we should havo a forco con stantly in the Pacific that would be a match for any combination likely lo bo brought against us on the Western waters. The very best thing to do with re gard to this fleet when it gets around' lo tho Pacific, is to let it stay there; nnd then add largo navy yards. dry docks, and every appurtenance and fa cility for the building of moro ships and kocping thoso already built up to tlio highest, stale of efficiency. Then all the navy yards on the Atlantic const should bo made busy in building now ships and replenishing the loss of tho battleships on tho East coast that have been sent to tho West. - With a fleet on tho Atlantic which would bo of greater strength than tho Pacific licet wlujn re inforced by tho ships that Ad miral Evans will couduct to tho West coast, the country will be in a well balanced condition to meet foes on either shore; and that is exactly what wo should bo at all times. Wc should keep our naval strength on both consts up to tho point of being sufficient to meet any combination that would be :n tho least likely to bo hostile. With an ample fleet it would not bo neces sary to maintain a great army. But tho army should als.o be kept up lo greater strength than it is, and should bo so organizeij that it could bo quad rupled on a thirty-day call. Tho President's excuse for sonding the Heel to the Pacific is all right enough, provided that fleet remains there. If it is to be taken back, then it is more in the nature of a fool hardy adventure thnn a matter of State policy or actual naval drill av'. test.
