TRYING TO CORNER ' THE POTATO CHOP | ??-i-evje.u utALERS IN LA^GE I CITIES ARE BUYING UP THE SHORT SUPPLY. WASHINGTON INVESTIGATES Country Endorses Justice Department's Endeavor to Break High Food Prices. Washington.?A new phase of the cost of living problem was brought to the attention of the department of agriculture. T. 1*. (Jill, secretary of the Irish board of agriculture, told Secretary Houston that speculators in the large cities of the United States were actively buying up this year's short American potato crop and plan- I nlng to hold out fur high prices, counthig on the existing quarantine against | } potatoes from many foreign countries ] to aid them iy their undertaking. Mr. Hill is here to urge the removal of the embargo on potatoes from Ireland and has been getting private advices from various sources on the potato situation. ( Secretary Houston and the Federal horticultural hoard held a conference alter Mr. (Sill's statement, but no action was annum.cod. Representative Mt Kellar of Tenno- ' see, author of a pending bill to proliibit the keeping of products in cold storage for more than ninety days, was in conference with department justice officials over the department's | investigation of the storage <>l" eggs, poultry and dairy products. It is said a preliminary inquiry has revealed ' that r.Ii per cent, of the present" egg 1 supply held in storage is in the bands ? of the great meat packers of the coun- ] t ry. i Letters and telegrams poured in i from all parts of the country, from in- ' dividtials, associations of various kinds ; and from business men praising the i department's efforts to break high i food prices by dings against the alleged combination of cold storage dealers. Interest in Attorney (lenernl I McReynolds' declaration that a sweeping investigation will lie made of the alleged combination and that if viu- | lutions of the pure food act were dis- i closed prosecutions could be looked | for, apparently is greater than in any i move the department lias made in a l long time.

Washington, running his lines with primitive instruments and lion lires or 1 bill tops, left monuments and boundaries to which terhnicaly educated surveyors, using high power transits and all the relined and accurate methods of modern instruments, allow they have been able to timl no variation. From the top of Middle mountain in the Massanutten range the old Fnlr| lax line may be distinguished without the use of instruments and can be followed by boundary fences da.ng from the earliest days and by blocks of timber which come tip for the county lines and stand out like squares upon a checker board. Down across the valley of the south fork of the Shenandoah as far as the eye can. distinguish the line shows plainly. Washington's survey blazes cut into the trunks of trees and long grown over have been rediscovered and all are several feet higher from the ground than those the woodsmen of today would make. Some authorities contend Washington made them from the saddle with a long handled ax. The government has been retracing the old lines because it is buying land through the territory which they run for the new Appalachian forest rei serve. Sultan Loses Suit in New York.
