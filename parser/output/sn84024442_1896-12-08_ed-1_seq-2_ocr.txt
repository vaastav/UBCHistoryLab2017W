H'KINLEY READ THE MESSAGE Refused to Discuss It, but Others lu Canton Tullted Freely. Canton. Ohio, re 7 -The burden of the talk in Canton and at the home of the President-elect today -was about President Cleveland's message to Congress. The people about t lie town discussed it, the -visitors discu.-sed it, and some of the Con gressmen who were here today mildly criticized crtain parts of it. Major MeKinley read it from copy fur nished l.i.n by one of the telegraph com panies an hour or tiro before Congress as sembled The opening" sentence, -with its strong implied approval of the results of the recent flection, seemed full of pleasant interest lor the President-elect, though he made no verbal comment upon any portion of Uie document. He read aloud parts of itto a groupof friends.and theywnmented occasionally on some of the writer's obser vations. Major McKinley turnod to the portion of the message devoted to a consideration of Cuban affairs with the keenest tntenM.an 1 read it aloud in clear, incisive, earner tones. A Congressman who was near tn said: "President Cleveland's exposition of the Cuban problem and his statement of exit ing conditions is just, graphic ami conserva tive, but it ispernapi lcs sympathetic with the insurgents tlian most iieople hoped for. I do not think Ills Idea about home rule for Cuba Avill come to anything practical, for the Cubans will not trust tin Spanish government, and would put no faith in their fairest promises. It looks to me as though we wo"ld have to recognize the insurgents as belligerents within ninety days." A new cabinet possibility lias swung into view. Tiw name is that of Col. Henry A. Dtipont, of Delaware. Said u friend of bis tonight: "Col. Dupont would make an excellent Secretary of War and under certain con tingencies may be seriously considered for the itosilion. He is a graduate of West Point, served with dUtiin-tion through the war, and i a capable and highly successful manor affairs. He is in every way quali fied for U.'. official position, and his ap pointment would offend neither of the Re publican factions in Delaware." Major and Mrs. McKinley enjoyed a drive today in the bright sunshine. Tonight there was a family dinner party at the McKinley residence.

MIGRATING TO THE SOUTH. "Wisconsin Fanners Selling Out and Goinc; to Georgia. Superior, Wis., Dec. 7.-The exodus of families from this section of the country to what Is termed "the Truit belt" of Georgia is beginning to attract considerable attention. It is estimated that already 150 families have disposed of their be longings i" Superior and Duluth and taken tracts of laud in the South, mostly in the vicinity of Sibley, Ga., where there is quite a colony of Northern people. Many of these people go down without a dollar in the world ufter paying the freight on their household effects, and there are many others who have a comfortable surplus left to begin work on. Immigration companies, backed by the Southern rail roads, have been doing missionary work in this section for a year, and claim to now have their colonization matters fairly started. One of these companies has 13,000 acres of laud near Sibley, and is selling it at the rate of $5 per acre. It is guaranteed to raise whatever a farm in the United Suites will produce, and independent in comes are guaranteed as well after a few years. Since some companies have been success ful others have been formed. Agencies are being established at points in Eastern Minnesota anil Northwestern Wisconsin. They are meeting with unexpected success. TESTING SMOKELESS COAL. Trial Hun of the Torpedo llont Cashing;. New York, Dec. 7.

"Wood ward's house on Wyoming ave ..,, nue,,, Mount Pleasant was ex clusively told in The Kvening Times of yesterday. The valu ables, tnlccti consisted of Jewelry and diamonds. The police continued their investigation of the Woodwiird robbery, which was "committed last .Ifrlday night,, but up, to a late hour last evening had developed but few new facts. Detectives Boyd, Ilelan and Lacy have been assigned to the case, but as yet have leen unable to locate the thieves. ; Officials ut police headquarters reruse to talk about the robbery, and deny that the thieves secured any large .amount of plunder. From other sources, however, it was learned that jewelry valued at over $2,000 had been taken. The robbers left not the slight est clew behind them, and up to tlie present time the police are com pletely in the dark. It was at first the opinion of the de tectives that the thert was committed ly some one of the servants or others w ho were familiar with tlie house. The oiflcers who are Investigating tlie robbery worked on this theory for. several days. ,but yester day discarded it for another. AT 

WORK IX BALTIMORE. On the. night fc.1 owit.g .the Woodward, robbery a smilar .Left was committed in Baltimore, af.bnt $l,t:C0 being-secured by the thieves.

The pc lice, It is said, have 1 o.v adopted tins theoiy. Tlo.se who have known or ;he robbery since it wrs first committed and have Ti.l owed the case closely taj that it is more than piobable that such a theory is correct. Public attention has been drawn toward Mr. V. ondward oT late be cause or his i ommatlon as chairman or the executive c nnuittee in charge of the in auguration rcr,ept.o:i and ball. lie lias been spoken of in the newspapers as a man oriarge we.'ibh. In view i.r iliee facts it is n ore than likely that the erf okspickid out his house as a g( od one-to visit. The theory that the rr.bbery was tile work or expert thieves is also I prne out by facts in the possess!. m or the police.

After committing a robbery the thieves leave town as soon as possible, carrying trelr I ooty with ttieni or snipping it by express to some distant city to be re claimed at a future date. Jt is now supposed that this gang made Washington one of their stopping places and alter robbing the Woodward mansion lea at once for Baltimore. Detectives In New York and Philadelphia have been asked to keep a sharp lookout for them. In addition to the list of articles already published which was taken from Mr. Wood ward's house, the thleyes secured a num ber of gold watches and chains, a gold bracelet, several .nlid silver toilet articles and a smajl.sum of money.
