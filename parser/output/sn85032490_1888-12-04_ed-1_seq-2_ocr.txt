Chicago, Dec. 8 This morning work men upon r using the sidewalk around a hydiant on Desplaine3 street were duven back by a horrible stench The remov il of a loose board or two disclosed a body at the bottom of the well sh iped pit. As neirly as the ofheers could judge, the body was that of a man 2) years of age and six feet tall He wore daik pants with a red stripe, dark blue coat and vest. In one pocket a note book was found which was filled w ith names, cards and records of one kind and another. Apparently the name of the ill-fated man was Frauk P. Dickersou The latest entry was tho following: "July 9. 18SS Will Spears- Tins ls.ifiiend of mine and f you can givo lnm any work tlo so I will bo on the Ohio river as soon as I save a little more money I am still working at the shoo business Your brotuer, GFOHGh V. SpfAus " Tiie name of George W. bpeais is not to be found in the directory Other ad dresses in the book were C D Mason, 4o0 Stevens avenue, Pullman, and Mis Dr Dickerson, Pullman The oflicera hold that these articles thus found in the pock ets of the clothes will lead to tho identification of tho body Tne natural conclusion is tint the man crawled under the sidewalk and died theie, is ren dered improbable from then fct th it from the position of the body it must h ive be n pushed into the hole where it was found. The feet were uppermost, and the bodv had apparently been thrust dow n so tnoroughly between the iron pipe and the brick wall that the hf id was bent to one side against the bricks and the les were bent up against the pipes It 1ms now been developed thit the body is that of the man who murdered Charles Gunderson last August At that time the latter's body was found by tome boys within three feet of the place m which Dickerson's body was found today, but strange to s,ty the police failed to discover anv other than Gtinderson's, who, as an autopsy showed, had a broken neck.
