"JOHN HAT, (Seal) "PAUNCEFOTE." S. MONITOR, THE FLORIDA. GEN. CHAFFEE REPORTS. Military Governor of the Philippine!) Tells Why Guerrilla Warfare .. Is Prolonged. Washington, Dec. 7.—The war de partment has made public the first annual report of Maj. GeJn. Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippine islands. Gen. Chaffee sums up the situation in the Philippines from a militavy^point of view by stating that the provinces of Batan gas and Laguna, in Luzon, and the islands of Samar, Mindoro, Cebu and Bohol constitute the area now dis turbed by any embodied force of in surgents. He says that to the phys ical character of the country, to the nature of the warfare of the rebels, who are amigo and foe in the self same hour, to the' humanity of the troops, which is taken advantage of by the rebels and the inhabitants who sympathize with them, and to the fear of assassination on the part of the friendly disposed if they give information to the American forces, is due the 'prolongation of the guer rilla warfare. He recommends that there be no further material reduction of troops before January, 1903. The civil gov ernments which are being organized —provincial and municipal—Gen. Chaffee says are both new and un tried, and there is but one certain and reliable method of ascertaining the progress of the FilijHnos in self government, namely, observation by the. army.

MINISTER. Michigan Preacher's Grief Makea Him Insane. He Kills His Wife and Two of Bit Children, Beta Fire to His Resi dence and Oats His Own Throat. Houghton, Mich., Deo. 11.—Rev. John Kinnunen, minister of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran church at Cop per Falls, Keweenaw county, murdered his wife and two children and commit ted suicide Monday night. Kinnunen was 40 years old and was universally respected. One son, a deaf mute, wai recently sent to the state school tor the deaf at Flint, Mich., and was killed on his arrival there by a passing train. Kinnunen brooded over his son's death, and Monday night became violently in sane. He first cut his wife's throat with a butcher knife and then mur dered his two younger sons with the same weapon. The oldest boy, aged 13, escaped, screaming with fear, and when the neighbors reached the house all four were found with throats cut and dead. After killing his wife and two sons, Kinnunen had fired the house and cut his own throat. The flames were easily extinguished. BOSTON VOTES. Gen. Oolllna, Democratlo Candidate for Mayor, Ifflt-eted by Largest Plurality In Years. Boston, Doc. 11.—The democrats completely overwhelmed the repub licans in the city election Tuesday, Gen. Patrick A. Collins being elected over Mayor Thomas N. Hart by the largest plurality in a quarter of a century. The democrats likewise ob tained control of both branches of the city government, elected their street commissioner, Salem D. Charles, and practically all their can didates for the school commission. As usual, the city voted strongly in favor of license. Tho result of the canvass was fully as much a surprise to the democrats as to their op ponents. The most sanguine demo cratic prophet Monday night claimed only 7,000, yet this plurality was nearly tripled. Two years ago May or Hart defeated Gen. Collins by 12,281 votes and polled something over 40, 000. This year the total republican vote for mayor was a trifle over 33, 000, the smallest given a parly enndi' date for mayor since 1893, despite a registration almost, 50 per ecnt. larger than then. Yet Gen. Collins received over 52,000 votes, the largest in the history of tho city, and he car ried 18 of the 25 wards. The repub lican leaders were inclined to blame tho weather, but this does not ac count for the tremendous gains made by the democrats in republican wards. The republicans of Massachusetts were not quite as successful in the 18 city elections held Tuesday as they were in the 14 held last week, for, al though they carried 11 to the demo crats' four, the oilier three being non partisan contests, three republican mayors were defeated. TRAGEDY IN THE SOUTH. Prominent lliiNl»M«n Men Kill Each Otlicr In Street Duel nt Zolfo, Fla. Zolfo, Fla., Dec. 11.—G. L. Powell and J. S.

From what facts arc at present obtainable, both men emptied their revolvers without doing any damage. Powell then went into the house and came out with a rifle. Both fired together and each man fell. Overstreet was shot in the forehead and Powell just below the heart. Overstreet was killed in stantly and Powell lived only an t] was one oi. tile largest lands in Florida. "THE

Dec. 11.—The first con ference of the American Federation of Catholic Societies convened here Tuesday with about 500 delegates present, representing an estimated aggregate of about 600,000 member ship of the cooperating societies. At eight a. m. the parade, consist* „ing of the local societies acting aa an escort for the delegates and vis iting representatives, proceeded from the headquarters of the society at the Grand hotel to the cathedral, where Father Quatman was master of ceremonies and Bishop Horstman, of Cleveland, celebrated mass, tho opening sermon being delivered by Dr. Lavelle, pastor of the cathedral in New York. Archbishop Elder pre sided on the throne with tho visit ing bishops in the sanctuary. The I music of the large choir was a fea I ture of the ceremonies at the I cathedral. The delegates proceeded direct from the cathedral to the Auditorium, where Anthony Matrc, president of the Cincinnati federation, introduced those making the addresses as fol lows: Gov. Nash, on the part of Ohio, Mayor Fleichmnnn on ihe part of Cincinnati and President T. B. Menahan, of Columbus, on the part of the Ohio federation. President Fries and Judge Thomas W. Fitz gerald, of New York, vice president of the federation, responded to tho address of welcome, after which tho convention proceeded with the busi ness of the federation. Although the exercises began at eight a. in., it was almost two j). m. before the first recess was taken, and the speakers commanded the clos est attention to the last. The con vention reconvened at three p. in., and continued its deliberations until six p. ni., when all committees were directed to report oi»| the reassem bling of the convention at nine a. m. to-dny. There were two motions made and carried with great enthusiasm, just before adjournment at night. One di rected the secretary to cable expres sions of good will to the pope at Home, and request, his blessing for the feder ation, and the other WHS for a tele gram to President Roosevelt, pledging him the roost loyal support of Chria* tian citizens. 

VOTES FOR EXCLUSION. American Federation Would IInr Chi* IICHC Detent* Motion to De nounce Ticket ScnliiliiK. Scranton, Pa., Dec. 11.—The exclu sion of Chinamen, Japanese and other Asiatics from American territory, ticket scalping, legislation and advisa bility of adopting a universal label for union-made goods were the principal questions that claimed the attention of the delegates at Tuesday's two ses sions of the American Federation of Labor. The resolutions advocating (lie ex clusion of the Chinese were adopted by the convention wilh considerable hurrah, but in the matter of exclud ing natives of Japan and oilier Asintio lands a snag was struck, and thin part of the anti-Mongolian agitation was killed so far as the present convention is concerned. The special committee having charge of the exclusion matter was unanimous in favorably reporting the Chinese section of the resolution, but was divided in regard to the Japan ese. The Pacific coast delegates led the discussion on Chinese exclusion, but were divided when it came to ex cluding other orientals. The liunlcn of the remarks of those opposed to the Japanese resolution was that Chinese immigration was the greater evil of the two, and that lo insist upon some restrictive law lo prevent a Japanese invasion may endanger the passage by congress of the Chinese act. The ticket scalping debate was quite a lively a flair. The delegates repre senting the railway telegraphers opened the fight against tlic resolu tion, making the poiitt that such action was beyond Ihe jurisdiction of Ihc fed eration. The "typos" were helped along in their arguments for the adop tion of the resolution by several social istic members of the convention. A socialist from Chicago said the rail roads were "skinning the people, and why not let Ihe people skin the rail roads—it is a skin game all around." When the viva voce vote was taken those in favor of permitting ticket scalping won by an overwhelming ma jority. The agitation for a universal label, which has been carried on for a long time, was ngain defeated. Those who favored the idea fought valiantly, but the delegates had made up their minds on the question, and crushed the prop osition when it came to a vote. A Daatnrdly Deed.
