The News published at Wilmington, Delaware, in speaking of statehood for New Mexico says: "That New Mexico should be made a state at this time is not believed by those who are aware of the character of that Territory in respect to population and area. To create a ridiculous state with a scattered population and population made up to a considerable exu-nt of those not qualified to under stand what statehood means would be a mistake." Aside from the fact that New Mexico has a much greater population than the state of Delaware, that its area is sixty times as great; that it has ten times as many school .louses; that it sent more soldiers to the front in the Civil War in defense of the Union, and several times as many during the SpanishiAmerican war, the Ignorance of the News of even primary school knowledge is ap parent when it continues: "There are already two states in the west iArl zona and Nevada which are ridicu lous. There are but few towns or cities in ei:her state, and both states .lave all the machinery of govern ment necessary in a real state." Any vchool boy at Wilmington could have informed the editor that Arizona is not a state, but a territory and that Arizona has four times as many towns with 5.(0 population or more than has Delaware.

President Taft aas issued a warn ing to census enumerators that their duty in respect to the census nas nothing to do with political affairs and that they must let politics alone while acting as enumerators. Yet the nomination of President Taft at Chicago was accomplished through the aid of federal officeholders. This warning probably means just as much or just as little as the one issued be fore the last political campaign. A citizen of Roswell tells the Rec ord that he does not consider it right that Carl Leopold should lie in jail while others are about doing the very jiame thing for woica he is suffering, if any citizen of Roswell knows that such is the case, he could do a good act by putting these others in with Leopold.

ROSWELL NOW HAS AN ALL-PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT. Cjlef Charlies Whiteoaan yesterday put Into effect the plan for an all- paid Are department for the city of Roswell. The old company of volun teers was released from further ser vice and men were hired to All out the needed completesnent. 8. Coffey, an experienced man from Oklahoma and Dan Kirkpatrick were put on the full pay list and put to work. They will make a full company of five men stationed at the fire house all the time. Walter GiU, H. Cronk and Hen ry Selleck were put on a part pay list, with telephone communications and arrangements for prompt service in case of alarm. Cronk will sleep at the fire house and be on duty from eight p. m. to eight a. tn., making the night company at the fire house number six men. These, 'With Gill Selleck and Chief Whlteman will bring the company up to nine men, al ways read for service. The change was made possible by the subscription of 4ne citizens to the monthly payment of - cnoderate sums for a period of six months, when the city will be in shape to hire its own men. W. A. Johnson president of the Roswell Hardware Company circulated the subscription list Tues day. Police Auction 8al. New York, Dec. la. Following the abandonment of the old police head quarters at 3U0 Mulberry street, for many years the center of in vest Iks tlou for more crime mysteries than any other place in (he world, with the possible exception of Scotland Yard, an auction sale of condemned police property was held there today. Among the condemned property is a copy of the Penal Code, another of the Charter of the city and a copy of the city ordinances. These are listed as follows in lot No. 2, "Two iron gates, one Cook'B P.ttial Code (1'J05), one Greater New York Charter 1S1), one city ordi nance S03). one boiler (hot water so gallons.) one stove (hot water) elR.it bedsteads, seven bed springs, nine oil cans, 135 feet cable tteleva tor), lot of iron pipe stanchions, quan tity of manlla rope." It could not be learned what art ist of the department was responsi ble for the arrangement of lot No, 2. It was conceded that the lot was what is called "miscellaneous." o 

POST OFFICE BUILDING A PAYING INVESTMENT, Chicago, Dec. IB. rae erection of post-office buildings throughout tilicf country In towns which have only rented quarters and branch postoffice es In cities where more sub-stations are badly needed has been proposed as an investment of postal savings bank funds that would save Uncle Sam millions of doLlars every yeaT, would add handsome communities and would give employment to hundreds nf thousands of men, the sponsor for tlie idea being former United States Senator William E. Mason of Chicago who has knowledge of the facts as he was chairman of the postoffice com mittee in the I nited States senate, "In Chicago, for instance," said Sena tor Mason in a letter to Chairman Geo. H. Currier of the Postal Savings Hank League which is urging the en act ment of a postal savings bill dur ing this session of congress, "the gov ernment would be able to save not less than a hundred thousand dollars a year by employing funds deposited In constructing the branch postoffice buildings which are needed. The in vestment of say $6,000,000 would cost in Interest, at the 2 per cent paid pos tal depositors, fully $100,000 less than the rentals now paid. Moreover it would give employment to thousands of men and put the money Into circu lation. There would be similar econo mies in other cities and towns." Ths problem of the investment of depo sits, which the hostile banking inter ests have held up as a bug-o-boo against the postal bank plan was one which President Taft in his message to Congress dealt with decisively, saying: "I believe postal savings hanks to be necessary in order to of fer the proper inducement to tnrift and saving to a great many people of mall means who do not now have banking facilities and to whom such system would offer en opportunity for the accumulation of capital. The question of how the money depo sited in postal savings banks shall be invested Is not free from difficulty, but I believe that a satisfactory pro vision for this purpose was inserted as an amendment to the bill consider ed by the senate at its last session in a bulletin issued by the Postal Rank Ieague It is said: "All mem bers of this League and all those who favor postal banks are urged without delay to make it their business to write to the members of the house sub-committee on postoffices and post roads urging that the postal bank bill as now perfected be reported for action in Congress without delay. A national organization to systema tically war against the white slave traffic has been practically completed and the announcement soon will be made that it be known as the Ameri can Alliance, with headquarters tn Chicago. State and local federations of women's clubs. Trig! lance and pro tective organizations and bar asso ciations, commercial bodies and the churches will be asked to affiliate or co-operate -with this Alliance for s united, well defined plan. Active aid will be given by this body to the Mann bill in Congress for the new fed eral statute to which President Taft referred in his message to Congress, faying: "I greatly regret to have to say that the investigations made tn the bureau of immigration and other sources of information lead to the view that there is urgent necessity for additional legislation and greater executive activity to suppress the re cruiting of the ranks of prostitutes from the streams of Immigration into this country an evil -which, for -want of a better name, bas been called "the white slave trade. I believe it to be constitutional to forbid. . under penalty, the transportation of per sons for purposes of prostitution across national and state tines, and by appropriating a fund of $50,000 to be used by the secretary of com merce and labor for the tnploycnent of special Inspectors it will bo pos sible to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and convic tion under a federal law." Efforts will be mads to secure the enact ment of new state laws by such legis latures as convene this winter in stat es where it is needed, as shown by the investigation made by Assistant United States District Attorney Harry A. Parkin during the summer. A di gest of the state laws of the country on this subject nas just been issued by the Currier Publishing company in book. "War on the White Slave Trade", which was the final work of the Woman'a World's Committee, the nucleus of the new national organiza tion. Increasing the usefulness of a pub lic library by adding branch libraries is the urgent recommendation of Chi cago's Public Library Commission and wealthy citizens are looked to for contributions for the purpose. The need of library extension work thru branches is declared to be serious, The advisory commission was com posed of Harry A. Wheeler, presi dent of the Credit Clearing House; Thomas F. Holgate, dean of the Col lege of Liberal Arts in Northwestern University; George E. Vincent, dean nd professor of sociology in the Uni versity of Chicago: N. D. C. Hodges, librarian of the Cincinnati public 11 brarv Association, and J. I. Wyer. Dr. director of the New Yom state UDra ry. It has reported: "The earlier conception (of a library) was that of i collection of books covering as com pletely as possible every depart went of knowledge and literature, more stress being laid upon having books than upon having them used. The modern library dea is to put the book3 as freely as possible into the hands of the people." The Commis ion urges the use of the interest 'inon the $212,000 Endowment Fund made up of gifts from private parties, for the expansion of the -library ser vice. This interest fund now amounts to $30,000. It is also urged that a por tlon of the bonds authorized by the last legislature, should be devoted to this work. The present "delivery sta tlon" method is condemned. m Removing snow from Chicago pave ments at $200,000 per inch of snow is winter's burden on the street depart ment, for the superintendent of which 17 cities have sent applicants to the civil service contest in which there are 71 contestants. The annual cost of removing the snow from the streets in the First Ward, which includes 'he loop district, is about $50,000 For several years this work has been done by the Citizen s Association, bu it is understood that after this year the work will be turned back to the street department. Every snowfall costs about $5,000 an inch to remove from the "loop" the cost being rath er high because of the necessity for speed. When Chicago has a two-inch snowfall, as it had last week, it usual ly requires less than forty-eight hours to free the streets in the business district of the "beautiful." This com pares wry favorably with the work in this line done in Paris, where they i-till use the old method of sprinkling the snow with salt and trying to melt it. When tuis works it causes so much suffering among the horses, their feet becoming frozen through constant standing and working in the cold slush, that the French people are beginning to protest against it. The Chicago method is to sweep the snow into piles, and then cart it off and dump it Into the river or lake. The new street superintendent will probjtbly follow the same course, as It has been found to be the best and lust as economical as any other and far quicker. The new street superin tendent will draw a salary of $5,000 a year and have the expenditure of $1,000,000 of public moneys annually Asa result of efforts of the City Club, which insisted that the examination should be open to outsiders, the civil service commission complied and Chicago hopes to have the best man for the position that could be ob tained throughout the entire country The marble, mahogany and porce lain of the big city hotel, the bigger and the finer the better, as a trap for the confidence man's victim has an- Write today for IQin

The poUce are now won dering how an entire, old-fashioned faro layout could be smuggled into he LaSalle without the knowledge of the management, but John Dawdle, contractor has admitted that fixed faro was the way in which he was separated from his money among all the elegancies that could be expected to seoure security. It is rather novel even in a city where the wits of the "con man" continually are giving birth to something new in quick and easy finance. Good clothes, fine ad dress and the supposed security of the hotel lured Dowdle to the room of one registered as Hawkins, who has been Identified also under other Attention Electric Power Without water j'our fertile valley lands are dormant, fail to respond to most industrious cultivation and con tinues to tenaciously hold the hidden wealth locked with in the soil. With water the same fertile lands are no longer dormant and no longer fail to respond to indus trious cultivation, but will bring forth wealth in a most generous manner. Golden fields of grain, green fields of alfalfa and acres of orchard will appear where now the lands are barren. This is the law of nature. To elevate the water from its present level to the level of ycur hinds at the lowest cost so the lands may be irrigated is the problem confronting you. The solution of the problem is the use of electric power for pumping. Electric power is the cheapest power for pumping and all power purposes for the farmer and all power users. It is not only the cheapest, but is the safest and the most reliable and convenient power that can be ued. In addi tion, it is the only power that can be applied directly at the point where the power is wanttd, viz: At the pump shaft, with direct connection to the shaft, saving the large loss of power due to friction in lehing, pulleys and shafts. We are ready to demonstrate the truthfullness of these statements to all comers. We are prepared to furnish power for the irrigation of 10,000 acres of land the coming season and will in crease our plant capacity as the business demands. Lines will be extended for a distance of 25 miles from our power plant where the business warrants the expense of construction. We are not justified in inclining I he cost of line construction and other necessary exjense unless at least 5,000 acres will use electric power the coming season. We will not ask the farmer to subscribe for any of our stock, or to contribute or donate to us, or to lie at any other expense than the cost of the line from the main transmission line along the public highway over his prem ises to his pumping station, the necessary pump and motor equipment for his well and a concrete weir for measuring tbe water. The contra t must, however, be for a sufficient period of years to justify our outlay and in such form as to follow the land regardless of change of ownership. Those interested are requested to call at our office or write, furnishing the following information: (1.) Name and Post Office address. (2.) Number of acres owned. (3. ) Number of acres to be irrigated. (4.) Location and description of land. (5.) Size of well and actual or estimated now and length of well casing. If well is to be drilled so state and when it will be completed. (G.) Distance water is to be elerated. (7.) Distance from our power plant to land along public highways. (8.) Names and addresses of others who require and now want power for pumping. Remember it takes time to construct lines and make installations and it is only a few months until yon will need the water.
