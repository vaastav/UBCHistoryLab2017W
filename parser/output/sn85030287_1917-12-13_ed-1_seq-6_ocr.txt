MEADE COUNTY NEWS. . MEADE. KANSAS. PRESIDENT WILSON PLEDGES AMERICA TO WAR TO VICTORY Asks That a State of War Be Daclared Against Austria the Wrongs Committed in This War Must Be Righted All Our Energies Must Be Concentrated on the One Object of Winning the War. , ' Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil ton, In his annunl message, called upon congress to declare a state of war against Austria-Hungary. He pledged America to war to victory and declared that nothing shall turn us aside. Ills message follows : , "Gentlemen of the Congress Eight months have elapsed since I last hud the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of Immense and grave significance for us. I shall undertake to detail or even to summarize these events. The prac tical particulars of the part we have played In them will be laid before you in the reports of the executive depart ments. I shall discuss only our pres ent outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties, and the Immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always In view. "I shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The Intolerable wrongs done and planned against us , by the' sinister mnsters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true Amer ican to need to tje rehearsed. But I shall nsk you to consider ngnln and with a, very grave scrutiny our objec tives and the measures by which we mean to attain them ; for the purpose of discussion here In this place is ac tion, and our action must move straight toward definite ends. Must Win the War. "Our1 object Is, of course, to win the war; and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to be diverted until It Is woni &ut It Is worth while asking and answering the question: When shall we consider the war won? "From one point of view It Is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amer ican people know what the war is about And what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose In It. As a nation we are united In spirit and Intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dis sent who does not? I hear the criti cism and the clamour of the noisy, thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling them selves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the na tion. I hear men debate peace who understand neither Its nature nor the way in which we obtain it with uplift ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I known that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their uneasy hour and be forgotten. "But from another point of view' I believe "thnt It Is necessury to sny plainly what we here at the seat of ac tion consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play In the set tlement of Its searching Issues. "We are the spokesmen of the Amer ' lean people, and they have a right to know whether their purpose Is ours. They desire peace by the' overcoming of evil, ,by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that Interrupt peace and render It Impossible. Menace Must Be Crushed. "I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this Intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of com bined Intrigue and force which we now Bee so clearly as the German power, a Thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed and, If It is not utterly brought to nn end, at least shut out from the friendly Intercourse of the nations; and, second, when this Thing and Its power are Indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace when the Germnn people have spokesmen whose , words we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are ready In the name of their people to accept the common Judgment of the nations as to what shall Hence forth be the bases of law and of cov enant for the life of the world we shnll be willing 'and glnd to pay the full price for peace, and poy It un grudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will be full, Impartlnl Jus tice Justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settle ment must affect, our enemies as well as our friends. Final and Convincing Lesson. "You catch with me, the voices of humanity that are In the air., They grow dally more audible, more articu late, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They Insist that the war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind ; that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished 'because the Irresponsible rulers of a single country have them- j 

SOLDIERS DRIVE RABBITS More Than 1,000 Clubbed by Men Near Camp Cody. When 4,000 men of the Minnesota and South Dakota units at Camp Cody, Deming, N. M., went on a big Jack rab bit ."drive"' recently the mule-enred long-legged pests of the Southwest en countered but failed to check one of the most vigorous attacks they have met since the days of the Mexican war, according to Arlo Bartholomew, a Min neapolis' man with, the One Hundred selves done deep and damnable wrong. It Is this thought that has been ex pressed In the formula 'No annexa tions, no contributions, no punitive In demnities.' Just because this crude formula expresses the Instinctive Judg ment as to right of plain men every where, It has been made diligent use 'of by the masters of German Intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray and the people of every country their agents could reach, In order. that. a premature peace might be brought about before autocracy -has been taught Its final and convincing lesson, and the people of the world put In control of their own destinies." Right as the' Arbiter. "But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a Just idea is no reason why a right use should not be mnde of it. It ought to be brought under the patronage of Its real friends. . Let It be said again thnt autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of Its claims to power or leadership In the modern world. It is Impossible to npply ony standard of Justice so long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Not until this has been done can Bight be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the nations. But when thnt has been done as, God willing, It assuredly will be we shall nt Inst be free to do an unprecedented thing, and this the time to avow our purpose to do It. We shnll be free to base pence on generosity and Justice, to the exclusion of nil selfish claims' to ndvnntnge even on the part of the vic tors. ; ' To Win War Our Present Task. "Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and Immediate task Is to win the war, and nothing shnll turn us ,aslde from It until It Is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of ma terials, is being devoted and will con tinue to be devoted to that purpose until It Is achieved. Those who de sire to bring peace about before that purpose Is nchleved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain It. We Rhall regard the war as won only when the Germnn people sny to us, through properly accredited representatives, thnt they nr ready to agree to a settlement based upon Jus tice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium which must he repaired. They have established ti power over other lands and people than their own over the great empire' of Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia which must be relinquished. Must End German Autocracy. "Germnny's success by skill, by In dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired, rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trude and in fluence, secured by the pence of the world. We. were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science anil commerce that were Involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the Initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she hnd conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away, to establish In their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political' domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rlvnls she most feared find hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and north ern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian mennce, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans, and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia, from the Impudent and alien dominion of the Prussian military and commercial autocrncy. To Manage Their Own Affair. "We owe It, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish In any way to Impair or to re-arrange the Austro Hungnrlnn empire. It Is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either Industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dfctnte to them In any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands, in nil matters, great or small. We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the TSalknn peninsula and for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe; their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and free from the dictation of foreign courts or parties. "And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We Intend no wrong against nnd Thirty-fifth Infnntry (First Minne sota). . A quick hunt over nn area about five miles square brought down nearly 1,000 rabbits. The soldiersscattered over the desert and drove the animals Into the center where they were clubbed. Besides Jnck rabbits the country near Cair.p Cody Is nllve with many kinds of animals and reptiles. Including deer, quail, sage hens, gonts, mountnln tarantulas, centipedes, scorpions and rattlesnakes. Gila monsters nnd horn toads also discourage the soldier la the German empire; no Interference with her Internul affairs. German People Deceived. "The people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their era plre; a war of desperate self-defense against deliberate aggression.. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false, and we must seek by the ut most openness and candor as to our real alms to convince them of Its false ness. We are In fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own from ttye' fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one is threaten ing the existence of or the Indepen dence or the peaceful enterprise of th German empire. Nof Again to Be Trusted. "The worst that can happen to the German people is th'.3, that if they should still, after the war Is over, continue to be obligated to live under ambitious and intriguing masters in terested to disturb . the peace of the world, men or classes of men whom the other peoples of the world could not trust, it might be Impossible to admit them to the partnership of nations which must henceforth guarantee the world's peace.. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might be Impossible, also, In such untoward circumstances, to admit Germany to the free economic Intercourse which must Inevitably spring out of the other partnerships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression In thnt ; and such a situation, inevitable be cause of distrust, would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure Itself, by processes which would as suredly set In. "The wrongs, the very deep wrongs, committed In this wnr will have to be righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany nnd her allies. "The world will not permit the com mission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and. settlement. , People Have No Say. "German rulers have been abje to up set the peoee of the world only because the Germnn people were not suffered under their tutelage to share the com radeship of the other peoples of the world either In thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up ns a rule of conduct for those who exer cised authority over them. But the congress that concludes this wnr will feel the full strength of the tides thnt run now In the hearts and consciences of freedom everywhere. Its conclu sions will run with these tides. "AH these things hnve been true from the very beginning of this stu pendous wnr; and I cannot help think ing that If they had been made plain at the very outset , the sympnthy nnd enthusiasm of the Russian people might hnve been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, suspicion nnd distrust swept away, and a real nnd lasting union of purpose effected. "The v Russian people hnve been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people In the flnrk, and the poison hns been ad ministered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote Is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often. "From every point of view, there fore, It hns seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose, to add these specific Interpretations to what I took the liberty of saying to the senate in Jannnry. Our entrance Into the warfhas not altered our attitude towards the settlement thnt must come when it is over. Declare War on Austria. "What shall we do, then, to push this great war of freedom and Just to Its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all Impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. "One very embarrassing obstacle thnt stands In our way Is that we are nt war with Germany but not with her ntlles. I, therefore, very earnestly rec ommend that the congress Immediately declare the United States In a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does It seem strange to you thnt this should be the conclusion of the argument I have Just nddressed to you? It Is not. It is in fact the Inevitable logic of whnt I have said. Austrla-Hungnry is for the time being not her own mis tress, but simply the vussol of 'the Germnn government. We must face the facts ns they are and act upon them without sentiment in this stern business. The government of Austria Hungary is not acting upon Its own Initiative or In response to the wishes nnd feelings of Its own peoples, but as the Instrument of another nntlmi. We must meet Its force with our own nnd regard the central powers ns but one. The wnr enn be successfully conducted In no other way. As to Turkey and Bulgaria. "The same logic would lead also to their desire to tramp about barefooted. There have been two light frosts during recent nights at Camp Cody, ac cording to Bartholomew, but the days have been quite warm. DOG 

GOES SOLDIERING Hunts Up His Master, Who Was Sent to Camp Sherman. Mike, a dog rookie. Is the latest con tribution to Uncle Sam's fighting force from Lorolne, O. Mike was the property of Walter a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. 'They also are the tools of .Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand In the direct path of our necessnry action. 'We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, but It seems to me that we should go only where Immediate and practical considerations Innd us and not heed any others, "The financial and military meas ures which must be ndopted will sug gest themselves ns the war and Its un dcrtnklngs develop, but I will take the liberty of proposing to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to he needed for the support of the war-and. for the release of our whole force nnd energy. "It will be necessnry to extend In certnln particulars the legislation of the last session' with regard to alien enemies; nnd also necessary. I be lieve, to create a very definite and particular control over the entrance and departure of all persons into and from the United States, "Legislation should be enacted de fining ns a criminnl offense every willful violation of the presidential proclama tions relating to alien enemies promul gated under section 4067 of the Re vised Statutes and providing appropri ate punishments; and women ns well ns men,, should be Included under the terms of the acts placing restraints upon alien enemies. Go Further In Fixing Prices. "Recent experience has convinced me thnt the congress must go further In authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply nnd demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the lnw of unrestrain ed selfishness. While, we hnve elim inated profiteering In Revernl branches of Industry, It still runs Impudently rampant In others. The fnrmers, for example, complain with a great deal of justice, thnt while the regulation of food prices restricts their Incomes; no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchase, nnd similar Iniquities obtain on nil sides. A Word to the Lawmakers. "The legislation proposed nt the Inst session with regard to regulated com binations among our exporters, In or der to provide for our foreign trnde a more effective organization and meth od of co-operation, ought by nil means to he completed at this session. "And I beg thnt the members of the house of representatives will permit me to express the opinion thnt it will be impossible to deal In any but a very wnsteful and extrnvngant fnshlon with the enormous appropriations of the public moneys which must continue to be made, If the war Is to be properly sustained, unless' the house will .con sent to return to Its former practice of initiating nnd preparing nil appro priation bills through a single commit tee, In order thnt responsibility may be centered, expenditures standardized nnd mnde uniform nnd waste and du plication as much as possible avoided. Concentrate on Winning War. "If I have overlooked anything thnt ought to be done for the more effective conduct of the wnr, your own counsels will supply the omission. What I am perfectly clear about Is that In the present session of the congress our whole attention nnd energy should be concentrated on the vigorous, rapid and successful prosecution of the great task of winning the wnr. "We can do this with nil the grenter zeal and enthusiasm because we know that for us this as a war of high prin ciple, debased by no selfish ambition of conquest or spoliation ; becnuse we know, and nil the world knows, thnt we hnve been forced Into It to save the very Institutions we live under from corruption and destruction. Cause Is Just and Holy. "It is because It Is for us a war of high, disinterested purpose, In which nil the free peoples of the world are bonded together for the vindication of right, a war for the preservation of our nntlon, nnd of all that It has held dear of principle and of purpose, thnt we felt ourselves doubly constrained to purpose for Its outcome only thnt which Is righteous and of irreproach able intention, for our foes as well as for our friends. The cause being Just and holy, the settlement must be of like motive nnd quality. For this we can fight, but for nothing less noble or less worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the wnr and for this cause will we battle until the last gun Is fired. "I hnve spoken plainly, because this seems to me the time when it Is most necessnry to speak plainly, In order that all the world may know that even In the heat and ardor of the struggle and when our whole thought Is of carrying the war through to Its end we hnve not forgotten nny Ideal or principle for which the name of Amer ica hns been held In honor among the nntlons and for which it has been our glory to contend In the great genera tions that went before us. A supreme moment of history has come. .The eyes of the people have been opened, and they see. The hand of God Is laid upon the nntlons. He will show them favor, I devoutly believe. Only If they rise to the clear heights of his own Justice and mercy." Olchdecky. a Lornlne man, who went to Camp Sherman, October 6. After the master went nway the dog lost all Interest In life.

WEST IS RICH IN ACID1 The New Zinc Field In Kansas Wilt' Supply , the Country's Demand for Sulphuric Acid. Eastern manufacturers will hav to turn to Kansas City and the Middle. West for their supply of sulphuric acii during the war. Prof. Erasmus Ha worth, dean of the University of Kan sas Mining School, has made a survey of reports of producers in various sec tions and, finds the West will soon be depended upon entirely for the supply of sulphur and sulphuric acid. The main supply of this acid wilt come from the zinc district around Baxter Springs, Kas. ,and Miami, Ok. and in part aTound the Joplin, Mo... , zinc district. The Joplin district was always known as one of the . largest zinc fields in America, but the dis covery of the field around Baxter Springs, the extent of which Is un known, makes it the largest in the world. With this field being properly' de veloped the , output of zinc will be enormous, and as this zinc is smelted the sulphur can be collected from the-" gases, making a supply of sulphur for sulphuric acid that will more than. . meet the demand in the United Stales during the war. ' At the present time about 10 per cent of the sulphur is saved at these smelters. To save the entire supply no new process or invention is neces sary, as the process has been in use in some places for thirty-five years. The United Zinc and Chemical Com pany of Kansas is already one of the largest sulphuric acid producers in. the Missouri VaHey. This company uses the ores in the Joplin district. With the Eastern concerns closed on account of the high cost of transport ing materials to the East the Western. firms will enlarge their smelters and amply supply the entire United States, Professor Haworth points out
