VOLUME XXXIV. MEDICAL HOUSE. 11 solli Frederick St., Baltimore, Maryland. Ustabli llo( l in order to afford Sound anil Scien tist MeJicul Aid, nnd for the suppression of Quackery. H DOCTOR SMITH HAS fur many years dovotod his whole atten- 1 tion to the treatment of private complaints, lu all their varied and complicated forms, ilis great succoss in those long standing and dilli cu'teasos, such as were formerly considered in curable, is sutlicient to commend him to tho pub lio as worthy of the oxtonsivo pntronngo which he has rocoived. Within tho last eight years, Dr. S. has treated rnoro than 29,500 cases of Privato Complaints in their different forms and atages ; a practice which no doubt exceeds that of all tho physicians now advertising in Balti more, and not a single caso is known, where di rections woro strictly followed, and medicine ta ken at reasonable time, without effecting a rad ical and permanent cure; therefore, persons af flicted with diseases of tho above nature, "no matter how difficult or long standing tho case otay bo, would do well to call on Dr. SMI 111, at hia office, No. 11, South Frederick Street. Tho afflicted should bear in mind that Dr. S. who is tho only regular physician advertising, has for many yoars dovoted his whole attention j to tho treatment of this class of Diseases. His medicines aro free from Mercury and all mineral poisons ; put up in ueat and compact form, and may be taken in public or private house, or while travelling, without exposuro or hindrance from business, and except in cases of violent inflammation, noehango of diet is neces sary. Bet tho unfortunate bear in mind w hen afflic tion overtakes them, that no time should bo lost in making application to a competent physician, as they would not only obtain relief from pain, avoid mortification through exposure and elude great constitutional injury, but enable their medical assistant to ho moderate in bis charges than ho could justly be, whero symptoms have boootno confirmed or tho diseueo more widely diffused. Tho rapid advnnco of this truly ter rifying discaso, is sufficient to alarm the boldest hoart. When ulceration and discolored Plotches with racking pains, betray to tho unhappy vic tim tho deadly poison preying upon his vitals, then, "and not till thon," do many awako to a full sonso of thoir danger. We aro oallod upon ovory fow days to euro Chronic Iliseasos. which supposed to have boon cured years ago, but instead of which, were only checked, driven into tho system by mercu ry or copavia and therefore socrns to be well but iu a longer or shortor time, by some slight cause, break out in its worst and most difficult forms, producing ulcers in tho throat, nose or roof of tho mouth, crruptions of tho skin, pains or swelling of bones, etc. On account ol the num ber of such winch have lately corns under my care, and the immense suffering which a little noglect or improper treatment in the first stages of the disorse may causo, Dr. Smith thinks it his duty to adviso tho unfortunate, particularly •tranacr* , to be careful that they are not decei vod b yfalnv ndvcrtucmcntß of boaitinrj qutickt who ir.ako promises which could not bo fulfilled oven by tho most experienced physicians. liy noglect or improper treatment, the patient is of ten roducad to a stato which makes the case ©x treinelr difficult to cure. Thereforo he should be aware of tho importance of consulting skill ful physician in the early stage of the disease. CmSTITUTIONAIi UEUILLITY- Young men ! beware of tho pernicious inilui gonco and liuost fatal injury you inflict upon your constitutions, by evil examples and tlio morbid inlluonce of tho passions. How many young persons do we daily behold, whoso countenances and debilitated constitutions depict discaso arising from that horrible and de vastating vice. . It could bo shown how attenuation of tho frame, palpitation of tho hoart, derangement of the nervous system, cough, indigestion and a train of symptoms, indicative ot consumption, aro often ascribed to wrong causes, when in re ality, thoj are tho consequences ol an alluring aud pornlcions practico aliko destructive to tho mind and body. # . You who have brought this aflliction upon yoursolvcs, why embrace tho secret to your hearts and vainly attoinpt to euro yourselves, iustoad of making immediate application to a skillfull physician, who in a short tunc, would restore you to perfect health and aavo you from exposure which tho fatal consequences rondor it onvicable. . Dr. Smith gives his special attention to •ho treatment of this destructive malady. Pa tients can be cured at homo by addressing a let ter to Dr. Smith, describing symptoms, and re ceive uiodicino securely packed lrotn observation forwarded by express or otherwise to any part ut the country. , N. B.—Persons nfll'icted with any ot tho nbovo complaints will do well to avoid hnnitiiuj impottori whether foreign or native, as also tho nuniorous Societies advertised as a certain euro for every disease. These preparations arc put up to sell and not to euro, and often do nioro harm than good, therefore avoid thorn. "A word to tho wise is sufliciont.' Address, DR. J* 13. SMITH. No. 11, 8.

Oh, fallen hero, noblo friend, Tis not the friend I mourn in thee, Though called, in mid career, to end Thy shining course of victor)'. I dare not grieve for friendship's sake, To know thy soldier's knell is rung— That shame or glory ne'er shall wako The silver trumpet of thy tongue; That dim the eye whoso lightning scared The traitor, through bis brazen mail; Those lips whose smile of sweetness cheered Our darkest day, are cold and pale. No solfish sorrow fits thee now, And wo who loved thee stand aside While she, our Mother, vails her brow And in her grief forgets her pride. When half tho stars of honor fade That gemmed her banner's morning sky, She sees them triumph, who betrayed, And he, her truest chieftain, die ! When low ambition rules tho land, And patriots play tho traitor's part, Wc ill can spare his open hand, Wo ill cau spare his honest heart. When timid lips proclaim their doubt, To chill tho ardor of tho brave, Wc miss his dauntless battle-shout, That never truce to treason gave. When freedom's base apostles preach Dishonor in the sacred name Of Peace, his grand indignant speech No more shall smite tho cowering shame! God! Thou hast sheathed the sword ho drew; We bow boforo Thy dark decree; But give the arms that build anew Our Nation's temple, strength from Thee! THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and Jlousc of Jteprescntatires: In Ihe midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause ot great gra'.ilude to God for unusual good health and most abun- | dant harvests. You will not he surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the ' times our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, I chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A dial oval portion oT the American people j have, during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to dissolve and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factions and domeslic ■ divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, or both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus j tempted to interfere are not always able to ! resist ihe councils of seeming expediency ntii j ungenerous ambition. Although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to I be unfortunate and injurious to those adopt-| ing them, the disloyal citizens of the United States who have effected the ruin of ourcoun- j try in reward for the aid and comfort which i they have invoked abroad, have received less I patronage and encouragement than they prob- i ably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have semied to assume, that | foreign nations in tins case disregarding all 1 moral, social nnd treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including, especially the acquisition of coiton. Those natious ap pear not yet to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the de struction than through the preservation of the ( Union. If wo could dare lo believe that foreign na tions are actuated by no higher principle 1 than this, I am quite sure a second argument could be made to show tlicm that tliey could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion, than by giving encouragement to tlio principal lever relied on by the exciting ot foreign nations lo hos tility against us, as already intimated is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the tirnt that it was the Union which made, as well our | foreign, as onr domestic commerce, tlicy can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for dis union produces the existing difficulty, nnd that one strong nation promises more durable peace and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than can the same ration, broken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discus sion with foreign States, because, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the in tegrity of our country nnd the stability of our Government mainly depends not upon tlicm, but upon the loyalty, patriotism, vir tue and intelligence of tho American people. The correspondence itself with the usual res ervations is herewith submitted. I venture lo hope it will appear that we have practical j prudence and liberality towards foreign pow- 1 crs, averting causes of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, 1 re commend" that adequate and ample mea sures be adopted for, maintaining the public defences on every side. While under this gen eral recommendation, provision for defending our coast line readily occur to the mind. I nlso, in the same connection, a3k tho attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. t It is believed that some fortifications and do- j pots of arms aud ammunitions, with harbor and navigation improvements at well Selected ; points upon these, would be of importuuee to j the national defence and preservation. I ask i attention to the views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report upon the same general subject. I deem it of importance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee and West- j em North Carolina should bo connected with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the U- j nion by railroads. I therefore recommend, as a military mea- i sure, that Congress provido tor tlio construe- ' tion of such a road as speedily as possible.— | Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and through her Legislature nmko the most judicious selec tion of the line. Tho Northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or Nicholasvillo to Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line in the direction of Knoxvilloor some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Government co-operating, the work can be completed in a very short time, and when done, it will not only be of vast present usefulness, but also an available permanent improvement worth its cost in all the future. Some treaties designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for their considera tion. Although we have failed to induce some cf the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration for the rigor of maritime war we have far removed all the obstacles froni the way of their humane reform, except such as are merely ot temporary and accidental occur rence. I invite vour attention to the correspond ence between her llritunic Majesty's Minister, accredited to this Government, and the Secre tary of State, relative lo the detention of the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by the United States steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this de tention was occasioned by an obvious misap prehension ot the facts, and as justice recjunes that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy tbc reasonable demands ol the owners of the vessel for detention. I tepeat the recommendation ol my predecessor in his annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to the disposition ot the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards oi the Commissioners under the act of the Jd o! March, 1859. It, however, it should not be deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, 1 would suggest that authority he given for investing the principal over the surplus re ferred to, in good securities, with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against China as arc not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our exten sive trade with that Empire. By the Act of the sth of August last, Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels lo defend themselves againid and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instonco oDly. For the more effectual protection of our ex tensive and valuable commerce in tbc eastern seas, and especially it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the com manders of sailing vessels to re-capture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the Con sular Courts established by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence and sov ereignty of Ilaytl and Liberia, I am unable to discern" it. Unwilling however to inaugu rate a novel policy in regard to them without the approhat oa of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expedi ency of an appropriation for maintaining a Chargo D'Affairs near each of those States.— It dues not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable treaties with them. The operations of the Treasury during the mcnt have been conducted with signal success. I The patriotism of the people has placed at i the disposal of the Government the large menns | demanded by the public exigencies. Much of I the national loan has been taken by citizens lot the industrial classes, whose confidence in their country's faith, and zeal for their coun try's deliverance from its present peril have induced them to contribute to the support of | the Government, the whole of their limited : acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar ob- I ligations to economy in disbursement and en ergy in action. The revenne from all sources including loans for the financial year end- I ing with tlie 30th June 1801, was $80,835,- | 000.27, and t lie expenditures for the same pe ' riod, including payments on account of the | public debt, were $84,578,034.34, leaving a | balance in (lie treasury on the Ist of July of | $2,257,805.03. For the first quarter of the finan cial year ending 30th ot September, 1801, the receipts from all sources, including the I balance Irom July Ist, were $102,532,509.27, and the expenses' $98,230,733.09, loaving a | balance on the Ist of October 18G1, of $4,- I 292,770.18. Estimates for the remaining three | quarters of the year and for the financial year l of 18C3, together with his views ot the ways ! mid means for meeting the demands contem ! plated by them, will he submitted to Congress 'by the Secretary ot the Treasury. It is grati fying to know that the expenses made neces sary hv the rebellion, arc not beyond there sources of the loyal people,and to believe that i the same patriotism which has thus far sus tained the Government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall again bless the I land. | 1 respectfully refer to the report of the Sec retary of War for information respecting the numerical strength ol the army, and lor rec ommendations l aving in view an increase of its efficiency and tiie well being of the various branches of the service entrusted to his care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people is equal to tho occasion, and that the number of troops tendered greatly cx ! cecds the force winch Congress authorized mo | to call into the field. | 1 refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the credi ' table degree of discipline already attained by our troops, und to the excellent sanitary con dition of the entire army. The rccommcnda i tion by the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon an uniform basis, is an object : of vital importance to the luture safety of the 1 country, and is commended to the serious at tention of Congress. A large addition to the regular nrmy, in connection with tho defec tion that has" so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar impor tance to his recommendation for increasing ! the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity of ! the Military Academy. I By more omission, f presume, Congress has failed to provide Chaplains lor the hospitals ' occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice and I was induced to draw up in the form of a letter, one copy of which has been delivered to each of the per sons and at the dates respectively named, and stated in a schedule containing also the form of a letter marked A, and herewith transmit ted. These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated at the time respec tively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since. I therefore re commend that they be compensated at the same rate as Chaplains in the army. I I further suggest that general provision he ' made for chaplains to serve at hospitals as 1 well as with regiments. | The report of the Secretary of the Navy i presents, in detail, tho operations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy i which have characterized its administration and the results of measures to increase its cf ! ficiency and power. Such have been the additions by construc tion and purchnse that it may almost he said that the navy has been created and brought 1 into service since our difficulties commented. 1 lies ides blockading our extensive coast, squad- I rons larger than ever before assembled under our flag, have beeu put afloat, and performed 1 deeds which have increased our naval renown. I would also call special attention to the re | commendation of the Secretary for a more I perfect organization of tho navy, by intro ducing additional grade! ?n the service.— Tho present organization is defective and | unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if q- I dopted, obviate tho difficulties alluded to, I promote the harmony and increase the ef | ticiency of the navy. | There are three vncaiicics on the Bench of the Supreme Court—two by the decease of Justices Daniel and Mckean and one by the resignation of Justice Cntr.pheli, f have so far forbore making nomination? to fit! •fcese vacancies, for reasons which I will now state. Two out of the outgoing Judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if successors were appointed in tho same localities they could not now serve upon their circuits. And many of the most competent men there probably would not take the per sonal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the appointments Northward, thus disabling my self from doing jnstiee to the South on the return of peace, although I may remark that to transfer to the North that which has heretofore been in the South, would not, with reference to territory and population,be unjust. During the long and brilliant career of Judge McLane, his circuit grew into nn em pire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts more than a notniual attend ance, rising in population from one million four hundred and seventy thousand and eieht een in the year 1830, to six million one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred nnd five in 18G0. Besides this, the country generally I hoB outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, system requires that all the States shall lie accom modated with Circuit Courts, attended by Supreme Judges, while in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, lowa, Kansas, Florida, California and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this bo recommended, without a change of the system, because the adding of judges to the Supreme Court enough for the accommodation of nil parts of tho country, with Circuit Courts would create a Court alto gether too numerous for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it he one, will increase as new States como into the Union. Circuit Courls are useful or they nro not useful—it useful, no State should be denied them. If not I useful no State should have them. Let tlieni | he provided for all or abolished by all. These modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement upon our present system. Let tho Supreme Court he of convenient number in any event; then first let tho whole country he divided into circuits of convenient size, Ihc Supreme Judges to serve in the circuit corresponding to their own number, nnd independent Circuit Judges he provided for all the rest. Or sec ondly, let the Supreme Judges he relieved from Circuit duties, and Circuit Judges provided for all the Circuits. Or thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, leaving the Judicial functions wholly to the District Coirta nnd an independent Supreme Court. I respectfully recommend to the considera tion of Congress, the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find nil easy remedy for many of the inconveniences nnd evils which constantly I embarrass thoso engaged in the partial admin istration of them. Since the organization of the Government, Congress has enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more Ihnn six thousaud closely printed pages and are scat tered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions nre often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful ns to render it very difficult (or even the best informed persons to ascertain pre cisely what tbestatute law really is. It seems to me very important that tho statute laws should bo mado ns plain and intelligible as possible, nnd be reduced to n3 small a compass as may consist with the fulness, nnd provision of the will of the Legislature, and the perspi cuity of its language. This well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whoso duty it is to nssisf in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form, the laws which so deeply concern their interest,nnd their duties I am informed by somo whose opinions 1 re spect, that all the acts of Congress now in torce, and of a permanent nnd general nature, might bo revised nnd re-written, so as to bo embraced in one volume, or at most in two volumes of ordinary and convenient size. And 1 respectfully recommend to Congress to consider the subject, and if my suggestions be opposed, to devise such plan ns to their wisdom shall seem mo3t proper for the attain ment of the end proposed. One of the unavoidable conscquonccs of the present insurrection is the entire suppression, iu many places, of all tho ordinary means of administering civil justice by the officers and the forms of existing law. This is tho ease in whole or in part, in all tho insurgent States, and as our armies advance, nnd take possession of parts of those States, tho practical evil be comes moro apparent. There arc no courts or officers, to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the insurgent States (and their vast amount of debt, constituting such claims,some have estimated as high as $200,000,000,) due, the large part, from insurgents in open rebel lion, to loyal citizens who lire even now mak ing great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duly to support ttic Government. Under these circumstances 1 have been ur gently solicited to cstnblish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far declinod to do it, not because I bad any doubt that the end pro posed, the collection of tho debts, was just nnd right in itself, but because 1 have been unwil ling to go beyond the pressure of necessity, in the unusual cx< reisc of power, llut the powers of Congicss, I suppose, nre equal to the anomalous occasion, and, therefore, I refer the whole matter to Congress with n hope that a plan may bo devised for the administra tion of justice in all such parts of the insur gent States and Territories as may be under tho control of this Government, whether by a voluntary return to 'allegiance and order, or by the power of our arms. This, however, no' to he n permanent institution, but a tem porary substitute, and lo cease as soon ns iliu ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible,for the adjustment of claims against the Govern ment, especially in view of their increased number by reason of tho war. It is as much tho duty of Government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same between private individuals-thc investigation and adjudication of claims in their hands belong to the judi cial department. Besides, it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually ongaged for some timo to come with great national questions, [t was in tended by the organization of tho Court of Claims, mainly to remove this branch of business from tho Halls of Congress. Hut while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuablo means of investigation, it fails in a great degree to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judg ments final. Fully awaro of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I com mend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not properly bo given to the Court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to tho Supreme Court—with such other provis ions ns experience may have shown to be ne cessary. I ask attention to Hie I'cport of the Post master General, the following being a sum mary statement of tho Department:—The revenue from all sources during the fiscal yeiir ei.ding .Tune 3 n . 1801, including the annual permanent appropriation of seven j hundred thousand dollars for the transpor- j tation of free mail matter, nine millions, I forty-nine thousand two hundred aud ninety six dollars and forty cents, being about two i percent, less than the revenue. For 1860, the expenditures were $13,006,- | 750.11, showing a decrease of more than j eight per ceDt., as compared with those of; the present year, and leaving an excess of ! expenditures over the revenue for the last fiscal year, of $4,557,402.71. The gross revenue for the year ending Juno 30, 1802, is estimated at an increase ot four per cent, upon that of 1801, making $8,083,000, to which should bo added the earnings of the Department in carrying free matter, viz : $700,000, making $9,383,000. The total expenditures for 1803 are estimated at $12,- 520,000, leaving an estiinatod deficiency of three millions ono hundred and forty-five thousand dollars to be supplied from the Treasury, in addition to the permanent ap propriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this district across the Potomac river, at the time of establishing the Capital here, was cmiueutly wise, and conse quently that the relinquishment of that por tion of it which lies within the State of Vir ginia wa- unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regain ing that part of the district, and the restora tion of the original boundaries thereof, through negotiations with the State of Vir ginia. Tho report of the Secretary of the Inte rior, with tho accompanying documents, ex hibits the condition of tho several branches of tho public service (1 2 and 3,) pertaining to that Department. Tho depressing iullu enccs of the insurrection have been especially felt in the operations of the l'ateut and General Laud Offices. Tho cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the oxpenses of our laud system only about two bundrod thousand dollars. The sales have been entirely suspended in tho Southern States, while tho interruptions to the business of the country and the diversiou of largo numbers of moil from labor to military ser vice, have obstructed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest. The receipts of the Patent Office have de clined in nine months about 

SIOO,OOO, ren dering a large reduction of tho forco em-1 ployed necessary to make itself sustaining. The demands upon tho Pension Office will ho largely increased by tho insurrection, nu merous applications for pensions based upon casualties of tho existing war have already been made. There is reason to believe that many who aro now upon tho pension rolls and iu receipt of tho bounty of tho GovSrn mont are in tho ranks of the insurgent army, or giving thorn aid and comfort. Tho Secretary of tho Interior has directed a suspension of tho payment of such per sons, upon proof of their disloyalty. I re commend that Congress authoriso that of ficer to causo tho names of such persons to ho stricken from tho pension rolls. Tho re lations of the Govornmont with tho Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the in surrection, especially in tho Southern Super intondency, and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kansas is in the possession of the insurgents from Texas to Arkausas. Tho agents of tbe Uuited States, appointed since the 4th of March for this supcrintendency, havo been unable to reach their posts, while the most of thoso who were in ofiico before that time have es poused the insurrectionary cause and assumed to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It line been stated in tho public press that a portion of those Indians have been organ ized as a military force, and are attached to tho army of tho insurgents. Although tho Government has no official information upon this subjoct, letters have bean written to the Commissioner of Indian affairs by sovoral prominent Chiefs giving as surances of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing a wish for the presence of Federal troops to protect them. It is bo licvcd that upon tho ropossossion of tho country by tho Federal forces tho Indians will readily cease all hostilo demonstrations, and resumo their former relations to the Government. Agriculture, confessedly the largest inter est of the nation, has not a Department nor a Bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the Government. While it is fortunato that this great interest is so independent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from tho Government, I re spectfully ask Congress to consider whether something moro cannot he given voluntarily with genoral advantage. Annual reports exhibiting the conditiou cf our agriculture, commerce, and manufac tures would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country.— While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture the opinion that an Agricultural and Statistical Bureau might profitably be organ ized. The execution of the laws for tho sup pression of tho African slave trado has been confided to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that tho ef forts which have been made for the suppres sion of this inhuman traffic liavo been re cently attended with uuusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for tho slave trado have been seized and condemned. Two mates of vessels engaged in the trade and one person in equipping a vessel as a slavor have been convicted and subjected to finoand imprisonment; and one captain taken with a cargo of Africans on hoard his vessel, has been convicted of tho highest grade of of fence under our laws—tho punishment of which is death. The Territories of Colorado, Dacota and Nevada created by the last Congress havo been organized and civil administration lias been inaugurated therein under auspices es pecially gratifying when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries whon the Fedc ' ral officers arrived there. Tho abundant natural resources of these territories, with I tho security and protection afforded by or ganized Government, will doubtless invite to . them a largo emigration when peace shall ! rcstoro the business of tho country to its ac i customed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature ;of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of that Territory. So far, the authority of the United States has j been upheld in all tho Territories, and it is hoped it will be in the future., I commend , their interest and defence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress. I rocom mend to the favorable consideration of Con gress the interests of tho District of Colum bia. ' The insurrection ha> been the cause of 

NUMBER SO. much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabit ants, and as they havo no representation in Congress, that body should not overlook their just claim upon tho Government. At your last session a joint resolution wns adopted authorizing tho President to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of tho United States at tho Exhibition of the Industry of all Na tions to bn holden at London in the year 1802. [ regret to say I havo been unabio to give personal attention to this subject. A subject at once so interesting in itself and so ex tensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretary of State and Interior a plan or system has been devisod and partly matured, and which will bo laid before you. Under and by virtue of the Act of Con gress entitled an act to confiscate property used for insurrectienary purposes, approved August 6th, 1801, the legal claims of cer tain persons to the labor and service of cer tain otlior persons havo become forfeited, and numbers of the Utter thus liberated are already dependent on the United States, and must bo provided for iu some way. Besides this, it is not impossible that some of tho States will pass similar enactments for their own benefits, respectively, aud by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal ; in such a caso I recommend that Congress provide for accopting such persons from such States according to some mode of val uation in their pro lante of direct taxss, or refer some other plan to be agreed on with each State respectively, that such per sons, on such acceptance by the General Government, ho at onco deemed free; and that, in any ovent, steps bo taken for colon izing the other classes, or the ono first men tioned of the other shall not be brought into existence, at somo place or places iu a cli mate congenial to thcra. It might be well to consider, too, whether tho free colored people already in the United States could not, so far ns individuals may be concorncd, bo iucluded in such coloniza tion. To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to he expended in the territorial acqui sition. Ilavir.g practiced tlio acquisition of terri tory for nearly sixty years, the question of Constitutional powers to do so is no longer an open one with us. 'l'he power was ques tioned at first by Mr. Jefferson, who, how over, in the purchase of Louisiana, yislded his scruplos on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate ob ject of acquiring territory is to furnish home* for white men, this measure effects that ob ject; for the emigration of colored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisi ana more on political and commercial ground* than ou providing room for population. On this whulo proposition, including the ap propriation of money with the acquisition of territory, does not tho expediency amount to absolute necessity—that, without which the (Jovornmont itself cannot be pcrpotuated. The war continues. In considering tho policy to bo adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I have boon anxious and careful that tho inevitable conflict for this purposeshall not dogenerato in to aviolont and remorseless revolutionary strug gle. 1 hnve, therefore, thought it proper to keep tho intogrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of tho contest on our part; leaving all questions which are not of vital mil itary importanco to the moro deliberate action of tho Legislature. I have adbored to the block ado of tho ports bold by the insurgents, Instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at tho late session for closing thoso ports. So, also, obeying the dictates of prudonce, as well as the obligations of law, in stead of transcending I have adhered to tho act of Congress to eontiscato property used for in surrectionary purposes. If a new law upon tho same subject shall tie proposod its propriety will he duly considered. Tho Union must bo presorved, and heneo all indispensable means must be employed. AT# should not bo In haste to determine what radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loy ul as well as tho disloyal, arc indispensable. Tho Inaugural Address at tho beginning of the Administration, anil tho message to Con gress at the into special session, were most main ly devoted to tho domostic controversy, out of which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or lubslract to or from tho principles and general purposes stated and expressed in thoso documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union pouccablo, expressed at the usssult upon Sum ter, nnd a general review of what has occurred) since may be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain thon is much better defined and more distinct now , and the progress of events poin.ts plainly in tho right direction. Tho insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of Mason's nnd Dixon's line, and the friends of tho Union were not free front apprehension up on tho point. This, however, was soon settled clearly and on the right side. South of tho line, noble littlo Delaware led off right from tho first. Maryland was made to seem against tho Union —our soldiers wore assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn u.p within her limits, and we were many days, at one tiino, without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to tho Capitol. Now her bridges nnd railroadss aro repaired and open to the Uovornmont; she already gives seven regiments to the eauseof tbo Union, and nono to tho enemy ; nnd her people at a regn- I lnr cloction have sustained the Union by a large majority and a larger aggregate vote than they over before gavo to any candidate, or any ques tion. Kentucky, too, for some timo in doubt, is now doeidedly and, I think, unchangeably.rang cd on tho side of tho Union. Missouri is com i parativoly quiet, and I believe ennnot again bo overrun by insurrectionists. Three States, of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which would promise asin gle soldier at first, have now an aggregate Of not less than forty thousand in tbo field for the Union, while of their cititens certainly not moro than a third of that number, and they of doubt ful whereabouts and doubtful existenoe, aro in arms against it. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months winter closes on tho Union pcoplo of Wostern Virginia, leaving them mas ters of thoir own country. An insurgent foree of about I,SOrt, for months dominating the nar row peninsula region constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, piave laid 1 down their arms, and the people there have re newed their allogiance to and acceptance of the j old (lag. This leaves no armed insurrectionists north 01 tho Potomne or east of tho Chesapeake. Also, wo have obtained a footing at each of | the Isolated points on the Southern coast of | llattcras, l'ort Royal, Tybee Is'and, near Sa- I vannah, and Ship Island, and we likewise have ■ some general accounts of popular movements in : behalf of the Union in North Carolina and Ten ; ncsseo. Thcso things demonstrate that tbo , cause of tho Union is advancing steadily South- I ward. Since your last adjournment Lieut. General Scott has retiroil from the head of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit, yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly he hae sorrod the country from a time far back in euf history, when few of the now liring had been (Concluded on Fourth Page.)
