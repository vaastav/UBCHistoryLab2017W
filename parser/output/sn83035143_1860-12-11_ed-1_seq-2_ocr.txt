' " " - Capture of a Slaver. The U. S, ship Constellation, on the 25th of September, captured the bark Cora eff the Congo Kirer, African coast, with 705 slaves on board. The Cora was a fine resesl of 431 tons register, bailt in Baltimore in 1851. She was for a time ei,;aged in tbe South Ameriean trade, and on the 4th ol May last a register was taken out at the New York Custom House for John Latham, as master and owner. The bark, in her fitting out, took on board such suspicious quantities of lumber, water and provisions, that she was arrested as being- about to engage In TJit slave trade, and was bonded to the amount of $22,128 23. On the "27th of May she was re cleared aDd proceeded on her "trading voyage." The next wa hear of her, she is captured by the Constellation.

Editor: Before this reaches yon tbe majority of your readers will have ascer tained that the "invasion of tbe State by Montgomery, , which caused so much excite ment, was, so far as the "invasion" is con cerned, the merest piece of Manchausenism, witnout anv foundation in truth. ' How the am that Jim Montgomery and his eaug of horse-thieves had "taken Fort Scott," coald .cause any excitement in the State of Mis souri, is a mystery; for every one knows that he has had Fort Scott and all of South ern Kansas for the last three years. Taa hare pernaps learned by this time that the "three hundred", armed outlawt who "invaded the State," "took Fort Scott," and "broke up the unitea stales District Court," have dwindled down to certain threat! of Montgomery's and Jennison's, and about tatern vagabond Abo litionists who lurked about Fort Scott for a few days before the Court vat to have been held. . ;.,., . . It is true that Montgomery is an anti-sla very fanatic, of the John Brown school, and that he has been to the North recently, and returned with arms of different kinds. -It is true that he baa distributed those arms to about two hundred of his raezed followers. who scatter to their dens at tbe approach ot danger, and are whistled together again, like a dock .01 quails.

TUa New York World of Saturday contains the fbllaKing notice of the death of Hon. De'aaon r HiHb: ' . By the late arrival from the'Pacific States, we have intelligence of the death of Delazon Smith, better known as Delusion" Smith, . S. Senator from Oregon for a single lea rn. ' Mr. Smith was educated at Oberliu, Ohio', by some benevolent ladies, wbo saw in him young man of good natural abilities, but quite poor. They intended him for the ministry; but Mr. S. took the liberty of quar relling with his alma mater, and was dis missed. Leaving Oberlin, he went to Rochseter, in this State; and started a paper, sot particu larly celebrated fbr its adherence to orthodox notions; in fact, the sheet was called "infidel. This enterprise fell dead in a short time. Yi bile there he bad a public discussion witn motbodist minister on infidelity, in which he distinguished himself for irreverence more than for argumeut. , Tad took place about twenty years ago. He soon after obtained the appointment of consul to some obscure South American town from Mr. Tyler, whose policy be had supported and defended in a daily journal, at no little cost to himself. He is said to have held his commission and drawn his pay for Bix years after the government ceased to know bis whereabouts. In I860 he appeared upon tbe stage of political affairs in Oregon, and succeeded In getting elected to the Senate, for the short term, from that State. Latterly he published a sheet not so remarkable for tbe elegance of diction or pu rity of style as for its vigorous personalities. Delazon Smith was well known in Lis section. After be left Rochester be was for some time in the office of Dr. Underbill, and assisted him in the conduct of the "Cleveland Liberalist," an infidel paper. He published a pamphlet entitled "Oberlin Unmasked, which had a large run, owing to the reeling prevalent against Oberlin during its early history. During his disappearance from offi cial view, as above noted, the' enquiry "Where is Delaton Smith," was almost as famous as "Who struck Billy Patterson." Mr. Smith was a man of considerable talent, which was, however, flighty and misdirected. X A ol-nt o t For the Leader. The President's Message. The President says, the long continued intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of Slavery in the Southern States has at lengh produced its natural effects; that this agitation has been kept up for twenty-five years by the public press, by the proceedings of State and Coun ty Conventions, and by abolition sermons, Ac, and has resulted in producing a malign influence on the minds of the slaves, inspir b g them with vague notions of freedom,and thereby causing serious alarm to their mas ters. ' The intemperance and agitation to which the President refers, and to which he objects, relate only to discussions touching the moral aspects and bearings of slavery. These dis cussions are important to the right or trron of an institution all-controlling in nearly one half of the States ot the Cniou where it ex ists, and which seeks to wield the powers of the Federal Government for its maintenance and existence. MK Buchanan would have the people of the Free States smother the no bler instincts of their nature, turn a deaf ear to the teachings of Christianity,of the Revo lution, and surrender the freedom of speech and of the press, lest the arraigning of slave holding as a sin against God and a crime against man, and the dissemination of light and truth on the subject, may alarm the mas ter and encourage the slave. If slavery asks to live in a Republican Government, it must, like any other institu tution in a free country, be snbmitted to the ordeal of free discussion ; and, if it quails under the truth and the light, it must go down. The question of when, or how, is for tlit partes concerned to say. It would be be strange if it should die without a struggle. lliat it is tbe moral agitation ot we subject that the President objects to, is evi dent, from tbe fact, that he admits that no act, except the Missouri Compromise (and that has been repealed by the South) has been passed by Congress impairing in the slightest degree the rights of the South to their property in slaves, and in his opinion no such act will be passed. He says Congress has not passed, k he thinks, will not pass any act excluding slavery' from th-Territories, that the Supreme Court, has,, decided that laves are property, and that owners may take them to tne Territories under the Con stitution; and further, tht the Fugive Slave !aw his been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement of his Administration, Personal Liberty Bills not withstanding. . , , ... Thus far, by the president 't own Bhowing, the Legi&lattve, the Judicial, and tbe Execu tive Departments of the Government have sustained the demands of the slaveholders, ea that the evils complained of do not result from political agitation, or political action. As well iniht .taa President or the Slave Power attempt to suspend, the laws of gravi tation, a attempt to create or annihilate mat ter as to attempt, through the Federal Gov ernment,1 by the cry of "dissolve the Union, oi by any other means to suppress the utter ance, by the people of the Free States, ol their deep and earnest convictions against that system of barbarism, which has been done away throughout nearly the entire world, Heathen and Christian, . save in free -and. Christian America. -i - . Men are tannted and insulted when, told that they live under a Republican Govern ment, and enjoy free institutions, and at tbe same time, are denied free thought and free speech. . . , -1 !..-- il According to Mr. Buchanan's version of this question (and no one will suspect nim ot undue bias towards "the J orth,) we see that no real grounds exist, either for secession by the South, or concession by the North. Tbe South has nothing -to demand. The-North has nothing to concede but principle and right. ' Let not the hue and cry of dissolution, money panic,nor tbe threaied horrors of civ il war, frighten the republicans into any com promises of freedom for the sakecf peace. If the crisis must come, let it come now ; to postpone it by compromise is only to aggra vate tbe evil. . Let ilr. Lincoln adnere con seientiously and firmly to the Constitution in all its pro visions, and let the strain come. If the Constitution is good for nothing for free dom, it is good for nothing at all. To desert it, or compromise one iota of its provisions for liberty, is treason, which Mr. Lincoln's S. Mr. Burch's Attorney. The Chicago correspondent of the Boston Transcript relates the following anecdotes of Mr. Burch's leading attorney: Van Arman, the leading counselor for Mr. Burch is a man of rare ability. He is the mntleman who, a few years ago, cleared at DetroU a won.au on iruw wr iue mux ucr ui her husband. It was charged that she ad' ministered poison in email cakes, three of which he ato daring nis speecn. it is sam that tbe jurors were not fairly in their room before he rushed out of the building and threw from his stomach the poison. He knew that while a small dose would kill, a large dose would act as an emetic. Mr, an Ar man was counsel in the case of Jumpertz,for the murder of his mistress. - Though Jomp trtz was poor and without friends. Van Ar man devoted himself to the defence with un tiring energy and at a cost to himself of many hundred dollars. Jamperti was condemned. Van Annan moved for anew trial,which was ordered alter tne gallows had been construct ed for the execution, and in sight of the con demned man. At the trial Jumpertz was ac Quitted. Eon. Mr. Osgood,- a lawyer of treat talent, is associated with Van Arman. besides some three or four other gentlemen of acknowledged gbilitj. s w ,. ; L
