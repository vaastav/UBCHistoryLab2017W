Open lug wltfi a plea for the eo-operatlon m all classes iu continuing the country' prosperity nnd In correcting exlstim 4 evils, for a "square deal", for every body, the message first takes up tin question of corporations and railroac irate legislation. The president says: Corporations. j I am In no senso hostile to corpora Itlons. This Is an age of combination 'and any effort to prevent all coniblna . Hon will be not only useless, but In tin 'end vicious, because of the coutempl ; for law which the failure to enforc ilnw Inevitably produces. The corpora tlon has come to stay, Just as tbt : trades union bus come to stay. Each 1 van do und has done great good. Each should bo favored so long us It doe good. But each should be, sharply 'checked where It acts against law aud Justice. ; Experience has shown conclusively tli at it is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of ! these great corporations by state ac itlon. Such regulation and supervision ;cau only be effectively exercised by a 'sovereign whose Jurisdiction is coex tensive with the tield work of the cor porationsthat Is, by the national gov ernment. I believe that this regulutlod ,nnd supervision can be obtained by the 'enactment of law by the congress. II tills proves- impossible, It will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer In fullest form such power upon the na ' tlounl government by affirmative ac nient of the constitution. The laws of the congress aud of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often 'In showing that the states have no power In the matter thnn that the na tional government has power; so thai there at present exists a very unfortu nato condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an In terstate business occupy the position of subjects wlthont a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over thpm. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the na tional government by affirmative ac tion. This Is only In form an Innovation. In substance It is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of Industrial activities has been recognized In the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose Is to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power It has always possessed, not only In this coun try, but also In England before and since this country became a separate nation.' - nnllroad Rate Legislation. As I said lu my message of Dec. last, the Immediate and most pressing need so far as legislation Is concerned Is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision aud regu lation of the rates charged by the rail roads of the country engaged Iu Inter state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the imposition of un just or unreasonable rates. It must Include puttlug a complete stop to re bates In every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation; caution and self restraint, but it should exist, so that it can bo effectively exercised when the need arises. ' Iu my Judgment, Uio most important provision which such law should con tain Is that conferring upon some com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought before It whether a given rate pre scribed by o railroad is reasonable and Just, und if it is fouhd to be unreason able and unjust then, after full Investi gation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly call edthis decision to go into effect with in a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high, . but that a fa vored, shipper Is given too low a rate. In such case the commission would have the right to fix this already estab lished minimum rate as the maximum, and It would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving Improper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my pro posal is not to give the commission power to initiate or originate rates gen erally, but to regulato a rate already fixed or originated by the roads upon complaint and after Investigation. A heavy penalty should lie exacted from any corporation which falls to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a liiaxlmum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform In tho matter of railway regulation, .f ' , ' It Is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate. This would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should 'be stopped, for they have now grown to such au extent that they are demor alizing and are used as rebates. Private Car Lines. All private car lines, Industrial roads, refrigerator charges and the like Dhould be expressly put under the su jpervlslon of 'the interstate commerce commission or some similar body so Tar ns rates and agreements practical-j ly affecting rates are concerned. A re bate In Icing charges or in mileage or In j a division of the rate for refrigerating charges Is Just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common cnrrlers. Only In this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted Into the national banks by the bank examiners. A few first class railroad accountants, If they had prop tr direction and proper authority to In spect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tions of tho law. Employers' Liability Law. In my auuual message, to the Flfty clghth congress at Its second session I recommended the passage of un em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia and In our navy yards. I re newed . that recommendation In my message to the Fifty-eighth congress at its second session nnd further suggest ed the appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of em ployers liability with a view to the en actment of a wise and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all Industries within the scope of the federal power. I hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speed ily as possible.; ' There bas been demand for depriving courts of the power to Issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power, but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an Improper ex ercise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would Justify the denial of the right to strike. Tho remedy Is to regulate tho procedure by requiring the Judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, tho hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What is due notice must depend upon the' facts of the case. It should net be used as a pretext to per mit violatlou of law or the jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not 'authorize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case In which it Is not nlready author ized by existing law. I renew the recommendation I made In my last annual message for an in vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states. Such an Investigation should take into account the various problems with which tho, question of child labor Is connected." in such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect Is the problem of turning out decent citizens. Tho future of the na tion depends upon tho citizenship of the generations to come. The children of todny are those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that the national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United States. I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation. As to Women Who Work. The department of commerce and la bor should also make a thorough inves tigation of the conditions of women in industry. Over 6,000,(XX) American wo men are now engaged In gainful occu pations, yet there is an almost complete dearth of data upou which to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as Important as It Is vast and complicated. The Introduction of wo men into industry Is working change and disturbance In the domestic and social life of the nation.' The decrease In marriage, and especially In the birth rate, has been coincident with it We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must bo made, but 'surely It can bo made with less friction and less harmful ef fects on family life than is now the caso. This whole , matter In reality forms one of tho greatest sociological phenomena of our time'. It Is a social question of the first importance, of far greater importance than any merely po litical or economic question can be. In any great labor disturbance not only are employer aud employee inter ested, but also a third party the gen eral public. Every considerable labor difficulty in which interstate commerce is involved should be investigated by the government and the facts officially reported to the public. Insnrnnre. ' The great Insurance companies afford trlktng examples of corporations .whose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the states which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by tho parent states. In my last animal message I recommended "that tho congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations cannot constitutionally bo extended to cover interstate transac tions In Insurance." Recent events have emphasized tho importance of un early and exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether it Is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of tho flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of these largo corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty. They draw tho line only this side of what may be called law honesty, the kind of honesty necessary In order to avoid falling Into tho clutches of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condi tion must be found In nil aroused pub lic conscience, n higher sense of ethical conduct la the community at large and especially among business meu and In the' great profession of the law.'aua In the growth of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the shape of bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation which is not only drastic, but practical. There is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insurance Interests of this country. The United States should In this respect follow the policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial Interests which are clearly na tional In character. I repeat iny previous recommenda tion that tho Ciugzt!:5 should consider whether the federal government has any power or owes any duty with re spect to domestic transactions in In surance of an interstate character. That state supervision, has proved in adequate is generally conceded. The Rerennea. There Is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection lu the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change In these methods ren der such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It Is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. No change can be uiado on Hues beneficial to or desired by oue section or one state only. There must be something like a general Agree ment among the citizens of the several states that the change is needed and desired in the Interest of the people as a whole, and there should then be a sin cere, Intelligent aud disinterested ef fort to make It In such shape as will combine, so far as possible, the maxi mum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary disre gard for the special Interests of locali ties or classes, but In time of peace the revenue must, on the average, taking a series of years together, equal the expenditures or else the revenues must be Increased. Last year there was a deficit Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. It Is impossible to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for It is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it It should be considered whether It is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In favor of any other nation maximum and minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure a certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations and ourselves. Economy In Expenditures. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy and, to this end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving of money can be made. There Is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant Information at which no human being ever looks. Yet, In speaking of economy, I must In nowise bo understood as advocating the false economy which Is In the end the worst extravagance. To cut down In the navy would be a crime against the nation. To fall to push forward all work on the Panama canal would be as great a folly. Currency. ' Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the element of elasticity to our currency system. Tho evil docs not consist In an Inadequate volume of money, but In the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond lis It should to the varying needs of communities nnd of seasons. Inflation must be avoided, but some provision should ' be made that will Insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In the less ac tive seasons of the year, so that the currency will, contract against specula tion and will expand for the needs of legitimate business. At present the treasury department Is at irregularly recurring Intervals obliged In the inter est of the business world that Is, in the Interests of the American public to try to avert financial crises by pro viding a remedy which should be pro vided by congressional action. Bnalneaa Method In Departmental, At various times I have Instituted In vestigations Into the organization and conduct of tho business of the execu tive departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclusions, they have already confirmed and em phasized the general impression that the organization of the departments Is Often faulty In principle and wasteful In results, while many of their business methods are antiquated and Inefficient I recommend that the congress. consider this subject. Federal Election. In my last annual message I said: "The power of the government to protect the Integrity of tho elections of its own officials Is Inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by re peated declarations of tho supreme court. There Is no enemy of free gov ernment more dangerous nnd none so Insidious as tho corruption of the elect orate. No oue defends or excuses cor ruption, and It would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous meas ures to eradicate It I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption In federal elec tions. The details of such a law may bo safely left to the wise discretion of Uie congress, but it should go ns far as under the constitution it Is possible to go and should Include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe Intended' to Influence his act or opinion as an elector and provisions for the publication not only of the expend itures for nominations and elections of all candidates, but also of all contribu tions received and expenditures made by political committees." I desire to repeat this recommendation. All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any po litical purpose should be forbidden by law, directors should not be permitted to use stockholders' money for such purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at In corrupt practices acts. The Hague Conference. The first conference of nations held at The Hague in 1800, being unable to dispose of all the business before it recommended the consideration and settlement of a number of important questions by another conference to be called subsequently and at an early date. These questions were the follow ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu trals; (2) the limitation of the armed forces on land nnd sea and of military budgets; (3) the use of new types and calibers of military and naval guns; (4) the inviolability of private property at sea In times of war; (5) the bombard ment of ports, cities and villages by na val forces. In October, 1004, at the In stance of the Interparliamentary union, I Issued Invitations to all the powers signatory to The Hague convention to send delegates to such a conference and suggested that It be again held at The Hague. From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled In some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging be tween Russia and Japan. The emperor of Russia, immediately after the treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, In a note presented to the president on Sept 13 took the Initiative in recommending that the conference be now called. The United States gov ernment In response expressed its cor dial acquiescence and stated that it would as a matter of course take part In the new conference and endeavor to further its alms. We assume that all civilized governments will support the movement nnd that the conference is now an assured fact. This government will do everything In Its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may be made in the cause of International peace, Justice aud good will. Monroe Doctrine. There are certain essential points which must never be forgotten as re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, we must as a nation make it ev ident that we do not Intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. But we must make It evident that we do not Intend to permit the Monroe dot- trine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect It from the consequences of Its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to Interfere to prevent tho punishment of a port save to see that the punishment does not assumo the form of territorial occu patlon in any shape. The case is more difficult when it refers to a contractual obligation. This country would cer tainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt On the other hand. It Is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take possession, even tempo rarily, of the custom houses of an American republic In order to enforce the payment of its obligations, for such temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which so much ns possible of a Just obligation shall be paid. To do so insures the defaulting re public from having to pay debts of an Improper character under duress, while it also Insures honest creditors of the republic from being passed by In the interest of dishonest or grasping cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to take such a position offers the only possible way of insuring us -against a clash with some foreign power. The position is therefore in tho interest of peace as well as In tho Interest of Jus tice. Santo Domingo, Santo Domingo has now mado an ap peal to us, aud not only every prlnc.Iplo of wisdom, but every generous Instinct within us, bids us respond to the ap peal. The conditions in Ranto Domingo havo for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society was on the vergef dissolution. Fortunately Just at this time a ruler prang up in Santo Domingo who, with bis colleagues, suw the dangers threat ening their country and appealed to the friendship of the only neighbor who possessed tho power nnd the will to help them. There was Imminent dan ger of foreign intervention. The pa tience of foreign creditors had become exhausted, and at least two foreign na tions were on the point of intervention and were only prevented by the unoffi cial assurance of this government that it would Itself strive to help Santo Domingo iu her hour of need. Accordingly, the executive depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which we are trying to Lttlp the Dominican people to straight en out their finances. This treaty Is pending before tho senate. Iu the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made under which the Domin ican government has appointed Amer icans to nil the Important positions in the customs service, and they are see ing to tho honest collection of the rev enues, turning over 45 per cent to the government for running expenses and putting the other fi5 per cent Into a safe depositary for equitable division In case the treaty shall lo ratified among tho various creditors, whether European or American. Under the course taken stability and order and all the benefits of peace arc at last coming to Santo Domingo, dan ger of forelfm Intervention has been suspended, nml there N nt Inst a pros poet that all creditors will get Justice, no more nnd no less. If the nrraugo- nent is terminated by the failure of the tiaty chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may be In volved In serious difficulties with for eign governments ever the island or else may ue forced Itself to Intervene In the Island In some unpleasant fash Ion. Army and Navy. I do not believe that any army lu the world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of Junior officer, but the army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision should be mnde for the pro motion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their comrades and for the retirement of all men who have reached a given age without get ting beyond a given rank. There should be nu Increase in the coast artillery force so that our coast fortifications can be In some degree adequately manned. There Is speclnl need for an Increase and reorganization of the medical department of the army. In both the army and navy there must be the same thorough training for duty In the staff corps as In the fighting Hue. The importance of this was shown con clusively in the Spanish-American nnd the Kusso-Japanese wars. The work of the medical departments In the Jap anese army and navy Is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to the na vies of other nations, always be of greater size than our army. We have most wisely continued for a number of years to build up our navy, and It has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard must not only be maintained, but Increased. It does not seem to me necessary, how ever, that the navy should, at least In the immediate future, be Increased be yond tho present number of units. What is now clearly necessary Is to substitute efficient for inefficient units as the latter become worn out or ns it becomes apparent that they are use less. Probably the result would be attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, the superseded or outworn vessels blng laid up or broken up ns they are thus replaced. Natarallaatlon. On this subject I recommend: First A federal bureau of naturali sation, to be established in the depart ment of commerce nnd labor, to su pervise the administration of tho natu ralization laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom plished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to be charged, and procedure. Third. More exacting qualifications for citizenship. Fourth. The preliminary declaration of Intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of his peti tion. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to he confined to United States district courts aud to such state courts as have Jurisdiction lu civil uctlons In which the amount lu controversy is un limited; in cities of over 100.000 inhab itants the United States district courts to have exclusive jurisdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of Buch cities. Criminal Lawa. In my last message I nsked the at tention of tho congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to the report of the attorney general on this subject. There seems to bo no statute of the United States which provides for tho punishment of a United States attor ney or other officer of the government who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing nny act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover explicitly, unequivocally and be yond question breach of trust In the shape of prematurely divulging official secrets by an officer or employee of tho United States and to provide a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Marine. To the spread of our trade In peace and the defense of our flag In war a great and prosperous merchant murine Is Indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets and In case of need to ro-euforco our battle line, It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that tho lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should be chiefly under forcigii control. It Is not a good thing that American merchauts and manufacturers should have to send their goods und letters to South Amer ica via Europe If they wish security and dispatch. Even on the Paeillc, where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag Is now threatened through the liberal aid bestowed by other gov ernments on their own steam lines. I ask your earnest consideration of tho report with which the merchant ma rlno commission has followed Its long and careful Inquiry. It Is a matter of unmixed satisfac tion once more to call attention to (he excellent work of the pension bureau, for the veterans of tho civil war have a greater claim upou us than any other class of our citizens. To them first of all among our people honor Is due. Immla; ration. As I said In my last message to tho congress, we cannot have too much Immigration of Hie right sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. The questions arising lu connection with Chinese Immigration stand by themselves. The conditions In (.'hlua Ire such that the entire Chinese cooly class that is, the class of Chinese la borers, skilled and unskilled legiti mately come under the head of unde sirable Immigrants to this country. But In the effort to carry out the pol ity of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi nese coolies, grave injustice and wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China and therefore ultimate ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu dents, busluess and professional men of all kinds, not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro cessors, travelers and the like, should be encouraged to come here and treat ed on precisely tho same footing that we treat students, business men, trav elers and the like of other nations. As a people we have talked much of the open door lu China, aud we expect and quite rightly Intend to Insist upon. Justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we cannot expect to receive equity unless we do equity. The Civil Service. Heads of executive departments and members of the commission have call ed my attention to the fact that the rule requiring a filing of charges and three days' notice beforo an employee could be separated from the service for Inefficiency has acrved no good pur pose whatever. Experience bas shown thot the rule Is wholly Ineffective to save any man if a superior for im proper reasons wishes to remove him and Is mischievous because it some times serves to keep In the service in competent men not guilty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts in view, the rulo has been amended by providing that where the lucificlency or Incapacity conies within tho personal knowledge of tho head of a department the removal may be made without no tice, the reasons therefor being filed and made a record of the department The absolute right of removal rests where It always has rested, with the head of a department The change Is merely one of procedure. It was much needed, and it is producing good re- -suits. Our copyright laws need revision. Philippine and Other Islands. During the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering from the series of disasters which since American occupation have greatly re duced the amount of agricultural prod ucts below what was produced In Span ish times. The agricultural conditions of the is lands euforce more strongly than ever the argument lu favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine Islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that tho tariff now Imposed by the Dlngley bill upon the products of the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff bo reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Dlngley act; that after July 1, 1900, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced In tho rhlllpplno Islands be entirely removed and that free trade between the Islands and the United States lu the products of each country then be provided for by law. In my judgment, Immedlato steps should bo taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This Is the most Important point in tho Pnciflc to fortify In order to conserve the Interests of this coun try. It would be hard to overstate the Importance of tills need. Hawaii Is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enact ed setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years 75 per cent of the Internal revenue and customs receipts from Ha waii ns n special fund to bo expended in the Islands. I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on nil citizens of I'orto Hico. I wish also to call the attention of tho congress to ono question which af fects our Insular possessions generally namely, the need of au Increased lib erality In the treatment of tho whole franchise question In these Islands. I earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. Aduilnalon to Slntehood. I recommend that Indian Territory, and Oklahoma be admitted as oue state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted ns one state. The Punauia Canal. Active work In canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been In prog ress for less than u year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to bo open to debate. First, tho question of route; second, the question of feasibility. Tho point which remains unsettled Is wheth er tho canal shall be ono of several locks above sea level or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this polut 1 hope to lay before the congress ut an early day the findings of tho advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating the isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provid ed for employees and an adequate sys tem tif supplying them with wholesome food at reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals have been established anil equipped that are without superi ors of their kind auy whore. During tlii past year a large portion of Ilia plant willi which !he work Is to bo done bas been ordernd. It Is confident ly believed that by the middle of the approaching year a sufficient propor tion of this plant will have been In stalled to enable us to resume the work of excavation on a large scale. What Is needed now and without de lay Is an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing ex penses of the commission. The first appropriation of $10,000,000 out of tho $i:iri,KHi,ooo authorized by the Spoouer act was made three years ago. It Is nearly exhausted. Unless the congress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. In conclusion the president recom mends nn Increase In the diplomatic and consular service and more ad enylate compensation of Its member.)
