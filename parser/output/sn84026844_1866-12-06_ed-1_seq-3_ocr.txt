Last night about 10 o'clock two men went to the residence of Mr. Robert Dinsmore, who lives abont six miles from here, on the Middletown road, called him to the door and shot him in the left breast and stabbed him with a knife. He died in about two hours from the effects of the wounds. A man namedJFogler was arrested, and it is reported that he confessed to having committed the deed, and also implicated another man. Previously a young man named Poland had been arrested on suspicion, but Fogler's confession exculpates him ot the crime.

M.?The court has just opened and resumed the murder trial. There are some circumstances connected with M add en's attempt last night to set tiro to tho jail, which indicates the presence of confederates outside. The vessel which Madden had tilled with live coals was not one of the jail drinking cups as previously telegraphed, but a tin box with a cover, which could not possibly have been in the possession of the prisoners when admitted to jail, as all of theui underwent a minute search. It is certain that it must have been conveyed to them into the jail. Another circumstance also indicates outside confederates. On Monday afternoon a person residing in the district was discovered iu tho jail yard conversing with the prisoners. The police allowed him to escape, but ho is known. Guards are now posted at every point outside where it would be possible to hold communication with the prisoners. Madden is to be kept in his cell for forty-eight hours on bread and water to allow him leisure to med itate ou the failure of his incendiary scheme.

XXXIXth 

CONGRESS, Hd SESSION. SENATE. Washington, Dec. 5. The Senate met at noon. Mr. Wade introduced a bill for the admission of the State ofXebraka. The bill was read a second time and laid on the table for the time being. Mr. Sherman offered a resolution to provide seats for the reporters of the United States News Agency and the Associated Press. Mr. Conness asked to have it lie over for the present, and it took thatcourse. A bill passed by the House to repeal the confiscation section of the act of 1S62. in regard lo suppressing insurrections, tfce., was discussed at some length. On a motion by Mr. Chandler to proceed to its consideration, Mr. Chandler reiterated the charge that women of questionable character had hawked pardous about this city, giving as his authority a J udge of the Supreme Court of this District. He urged the passage ! of the bill. Mr. Howe thought it should be sent to the Judiciary Committee; it should not bo hurriedly considered. Mr. Grimes opposed the considering of the resolution now. He feared that {the country would regard the baste as | an attempt to incite the President to do the very thing sought to be avoided. i Mr. Dickson, of Conn., contradicted | the statement made by Mr. Chandler j in regard to the sale of pardons and said there was no truth in it, although he was not at liberty to state the real facts of the case now. He hoped the bill would bo referred to the Judiciary committee. Mr. Trumbull advocated referring the bill for the present, but hoped it would not be supposed that he opposed the bill. Mr. Chandler withdrew his objection to the reference, and it took that course. The regular standing committees were then appointed by resolution. On motion, various portions of {the President's Message were referred to the appropriate committees. Mr. Sumner introduced his resolution in regard to Reconstruction and the dutyol Congress in relation thereto. He then read letters from Texas alleging that the government of that State was a sham, and was in opposition to the Union, as well as that the legislature aimed to practically restore the institution of slavery. The resolution was laid over. A number of bills, etc., previously introduced, were then referred to appropriate committees. The Senate concuired in the Joint Resolution from the House empowering the Committee on Reconstruction, appointed last session, to continue its labors. Senate adjourned. 

HOUSE* The House met at lii o'clock, and after prayer by the chaplain, the journal of yesterday was read. The Speaker laid before the House the laws of the Territory of Dacotah. Mr. Wasliburne, of Illinois, offered a resolution catling on the Secretary of War to communicate to the House the report of the tour of inspection of Brevet Brig. Gen. Babcock, made during the past season, or such portions thereof as he may deem proper to communicate. Mr. Williams, of Pa., moved to reoonsider the bill regulating appointments to oflice, which was reported by him last session, and proceeded to state his reason for making the motion at this time. Tho bill, he said, was of great national importance. He discussed fully the policy which should govern appointments aud removals from oflice, combating the idea that the President has or should have an irresponsible right to remove, and quoting freely from political and legal decisions in support of his position. Mr. Williams, of Pa., moved to reconsider tbe bill regulating the appointment of officers reported by him at tho last session, and then proeeeded to argue in favor of the bill. It rested, he said, on the hypothesis of that power of removal. It did not rightfully belong to the President alone under the Constitution, and that it could not be safely left with him without restraint upon the exercise, and this upon a general principle, and without any reference to tho merits or demerits of tho existing functionary. It aimed at the reformation of a great vice in the administration of the government, by bringing its practice back to the true spirit and meaning of the fundamental law. In doing so it disturbed no ti iie?> nun utiuutwcu uu juuicmi preceueni. It contemplated merely 11 legislative opinion of yesterday, and it was not the first time that opinion had been questioned. It had been anticipated by u denial of an authentic character. It was the opinion of a divided court, and it was not even old enough to be venerable. But to estimate justly the weight to which it was entitled, it would be necessary to show its precise exteut, the circumstances by which it was attended, and the argument by which it was sustained. It was noted that those who were opposed to the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, had objected that it would give to the President the executive powers of a King. Not even the advocates of its adoption claimed that it was intended to give him the eminently kingly power of removing the other officers of the government at his own individual will. Ou the meeting ot the tirstCougress, however, the question came up whether the head of the department of foreign affairs should be removable at the will of the President, oue party claiming that the power of removal was iucluded in the power to appoint, and contending that it could be exercised only in connection with the Senate. The other, at the head of which was Madison, contending that it was thus entrusted with a great power which, however, was so prudent and conscientiously exercised for a long time that the confidence reposed in the executive seemed to be justified, and when the statesmen of u later period became alarmed at the use that was made of that power, it was found to be in vain, because a triumphant party, looking to the offices of the government as its lawful spoils, resisted successfully every attempt to go back to the true reading of the Constitution. Mr. Williams then proceeded to argue at length in favor of the policy of restoring the executive powers, and quoted freely from political authorities and j legal decisions in support of his view. , He then reviewed the course of the I present executive, and his avowals of! the policy ho intended to pursue in this respect, arguing thai the interests of the ! country, the nrinciples of the Constitution and the dignity of the people, and of Congress and as their representatives, I all demanded that the power of the | President should b? restricted by the passage ofthis bill, and that if the ex- | ecutive then failed or refused to obey 1 the will of the people, the obstacles shall be removed. At the conclusion of Mr. I Williams' speech, he said he did not wish to press the passage of the bill at this time, and that the previous question on the motion be reconsidered. Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, hoped the motion would be withdrawn; if the motion to reconsider should prevail; he desired Jo have the bill referred to the Joint Select Committee on Retrenchment, to which the whole subject had been committed. Mr. S'evens thought it had better, be referred to the Committee on Judiciarv. Mr. Kasson inquired if there had been a change made in the first section of the bill, which provided that no officer should be removed except by the same agency that appoiuted him," and also if there was not a provision excepting the heads of departments from the operation of the law. Mr. Schenck reported that the Joint Committee on Retrenchment had been expressly entrusted to consider this whole subject, and it was in his opin- j ion the appropriate committee to consider it. Mr. Wilson thought the House could consider the bill as well as the committee could. Mr. Schenck said that after the bill was reported from the Committee on the Judiciary the House concurred with the Senate in appointing a joint select committee, consisting of three Seuators and five members of thef House, and entrusted to them the consideration of the whole matter; that the committee might be inferior in ability to the Judiciary Committee, to which the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens) desired to have the bill referred, yet it was hoped that by the action of the eight members of the committee jointly, Dosed upon a good deal mTHM'UV U, 10UQ.| of exnminatioa of matter and upon a good deal of testimony taken during the recess, they would be able to legislate with some degree of wisdom on the Bubject, and he hoped the bill would be referred to them. A bill of this character should be very carefully prepared, and so thinking the Joint Committee on Retrenchment had setup this subject as their first business.-? j They had all this morniue been! engaged in considering it, and they hoped to take it up again and complete the consideration of it to-uiorrow morning. There were pending in the House and Senate five or six different bills on the same subject, and it was the intention of the committee to select from all these bills whatever was especially in substance, or best expressed, hoping thereby to framo a bill such as would meet the approval of both the House and Senate. The Speaker announced a message from the Senate stating that it had passed the House bill appointing two managers for the Union Soldiers National Asylum. Mr. Schenck moved to amend Mr. Stevens' motion to refer the bill regulating appointments to office to the Judiciary Committee, by moving to refer it to the Joint Committee on Entrenchments. Mr. Williams, of Pa., moved to amend by striking out the third sectiou of the bill, and offered a substitute therefor. Additional amendments were offered by Messrs. Schenck, Stevens, Hale of N. Y., and Garfield. On motion of Mr. Williams, tho bill with all the amendments proposed, was ordered to be printed, and made the special order for to-uiorrow. Mr. Lawrence, of Ohio, from the Committee on the Judiciary, reported House bill -No. 035, to amend the act regulating the proceedings in Criminal cases, and for other purposes, with an amendment substituting the word four for the word two, andithus making the bill provide that in the trial of any offence in which the right of trial by jury exists, the defendant shall bo entitled to only four peremptory challenges. This, however does not apply, to trials for capital offences. The amendment was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to a third reading and passed. Mr. Lawrence, from the Judiciary Committee, reported House bill 41?. r? luting to the qualifications of juries in capital cases, with an amendment providing in eases of trial for crimes against the United States, no juror shall be rejected by reason of bis having expressed or formed an opiuion on the guilt or innocence of the accused, from having read the newspapers of the day, and from the current report, provided he is otherwise competent. An amendment was also proposed striking out all after the enacting clause, and providing that the trial of any person charged with treason or having taken part in rebellion ugainst the authority of the United, States or having given aid and comfort to rebels against that authority. When a person called as a juror shall state that he formed orexpreHSed an opinion as to the guilt of or innocence of the accused, the court shall therein proceed to examine him as to the ground of his opiuion, and if it shall appear that it has been formed upon newspaper reports or lieresay, and not upon conversation with the case, and if the juror shall say that he feels capable, notwithstanding that opinion, of rendering an impartial verdict upon the evidence under the law; that ho will do so, need not be rejected. Also providing in the second section that tho courts of the United States shall have power to select or order to be selected by lot or otherwise such jurors as may be deemed necessary for the proper administration of justice, to "issue or enforce a process therefore. Mr. Lawrance who reported the bill, said that tho State of Ohio had a law similar to that now proposed to be enacted, and that this bill having been very fully considered by the Committee on the Judiciary, ho thought that it might pass. Mr. Le Blond, of Ohio, wished to suggest that inasmuch as tho bill proposed to change entirely the existing law concerning tho qualification of jurors, bethought it only wise and proper that it should bo printed, so that tho members might see it and be able to come to an intelligent conclusion on the subject. He was aware that Ohio had laws like this, but it was very questionable whether, in the opinion <?1 the people of that State, it was considered an improvement upon the old law. Indeed he believed that in the main it^was considered not to be an improvement. Ho hoped that his colleague (Mr. Lawrence,) would permit the amendment to be printed. Mr. Lawrence replied that the subject had been a long time before Congress, and had been duly considered, and ho hoped it would be disposed of at this time. In Ohio, where a similar law was in force, he had never heard any objection to it from any quarter. \f - ??n..n..0 *>-- ' - -? * ?.??. Uiv<v-u^t "I i n., 

II1IU BOll U UOUOl as to the propriety of changing the exest ing law. Ho was ill favor of punishing criminals, but he did not know that it was desirable to enact any new law on the subject. He therefore uioved that further consideration of the bill be postponed until Monday next, in order that it might be printed. Mr. Lawrence, froin the Committee on the Judiciary, reported a bill to protect the rights of action of loyal citizens. The bill provides that when a citizen ol the United States, who has always re: mained loyal to the Government shall begin an action to recover an injury to Eerson or property, no such action shall e defeated on the ground that the act complained of was done by virtue o! authority of the late so-called Confederate States of America or any State declared in rebellion by the President's E reclamation, unless such act was done y decrees or in obedience to judgment or decree of a Judicial Court. Tho bill was amended by striking out in lieu ol the words justily or sustain and insert1 ing the word allow.and also by striking : out the words unless the'action complained of was done by decrees or in I obedience to decree of a Judicial Court. | The bill as amended was read tho third I time and passed. | Mr. Perham, <bf Maine, from the Committee on Pensions, reported Senate ' bill to provide for the payment of pen| sions. The bill authorizes the Presii dent to establish agencies for the payj ment of pensions wherever in his judgment the public interest and convenience of pensioners require agents to be I appointed, by and with the consent ol the Senate, and to holdofllce for a term of tour years. Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, desired to otfer two or three amendments to the bill as it stood. It conferred upon the President power to establish agencies for the payment of pensions wherever, in his judgtneut, the public interests and convenience of pensioners I required. He was opposed to giving j that power to the President, or that | part of tho bill and all other similar parts, if there were any, so as to make I it necessary for the President to send | to Congress the names of places where I he wished to establish agencies and ol the persons that he desired to appoint I as agents. Mr. Lawrence said that if those portions were struck out there would be nothing left of the bill. Mr. Washburne said, no matter. He would move to strike them out and to amend the bill so as to limit the number of pension agencies in any one State or territory to three, and to provide that no pension agencies, or additions to those now existing should be established in any State or territory in which the whole" amount of pensions paid during the fiscal year next preceding shall not have exceeded $500,000. Mr. Wilson, of Iowa, moved to recommit the bill with amendment to the committee, with power to report on it at any time. Agreed to. After the presentation of one or two other reports not of general interest, the House adjourned. Immediately after the adjournment the clerk gave notice than an adjourned caucus of the Union members of the House would be held at 7 o'clock this evening. Steamer Scotland Abandoned.

J Wuhlnirtoii Special*. ! New York, Dec. 4.?A .special dis| patch says: Rumors are beginning to 1 circulate again of a change in the State * Department. It is now said that Hon. j Reverdy Johnson is likely soon to take r the portfolio of Secretary Seward. At all events it is prettv certain that something is wrong, for ft is generally whispered in diplomatic circles that Mr. Seward will soon retire. The Republican Senators met in cauciihs to-day for the purpose of arrang- , iug standing committees of the Senate. The committee who have charge of the matter were not ready to make tbeir ' report, and they adjourned to meet tomorrow at 11 o'clock. It appears there is some difficulty in arranging the \ chairmanship for three or four important committees, the special committee having decided to uepose Doolittle from the chairmanship of the Indiau Committee, and Dixon from the Post- ' office Committee, and Cowan from tlie J important committees which he holds. ' They are casting about to got prop- i er men to take these positions, < and this evening had not determined on the proposed changes. It will be lully decided iu to-morrow's caucus. The Senators to be deposed have no idea of what is going on. After the committee question Jh disposed of, a , move will be made in the caucus to bring up the question of electing a new Vice President, in the placo of Senator Foster. It will be opposed by several Republican Senators, who are disinclined to make any change at present. The friends of Seuator Wade, however, are determined to prosecute the matter vigorously to secure his election. It is doubtful whether any thing can be done now in the matter. It is said that there will be no election before the 4th ol March. It is reported that Secretary McCullocli, anticipating the action which Congress is likely to take, has ordered Mr. Vandyke, Assistant Treasurer, at New York, to sell gradually a few millions of gold. It is pretty certain that Congress will pass the bill which Gov. ttoutwell submitted yesterday ou this subject. There has already accumulated nearly 0110 hundred millions in the treasury. Representative Biugham, of Ohio, emphatically denies the truth of the paragraph extensively published, that ho was preparing articles against the President 011 the .ground of complicity in the assassination ot the late President Lincoln. He says he never had such au idea, aud therefore never so intimated. Louisville, Dec. 5.?The rise in the rivor to-day is disengaging all tow boats stuck on the falls, and will carry all coal boats to their Southern destination. Mobile, Dec. 3.?The racing over the Magnolia course opened to-day. The iirst ace'was a dash of one mile for two year olds. It was won by Mr. Alexanders, of Calada. 

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL. MABKF.T8 BY TELKilRAPII. Spirit or tlie New YorK Miirket.

The dry goods market was quiet hnt steady with a fair trade. The meeting of Congress and tlie President's message was entirely without, effect upon tlie market. With lower prices for cotton. dry goods must naturally soften a little, hut holders are too confident to learn any prospect of any further decline than the decline in raw material, and the actual cost of production Is reduced. The margin of profit in the manufacture of cotton goods is reported as great enough to warrant mills running on reduced time. Koine mills are -reputing lower wanes ns u preferable step to stopping, and throwing numbers of poor people out or employ mint. llrowii sheetings and Fhlrtings are quiet, with the exception of standard and other leading prime marks which are Kc higher in jobbers' bauds. In bleached shlrtinas and sheetings there is a light, steady business. Prints are without quotable chauge. Trade is quite uniform iu ticks, out stripes are without particular moment. There is little omo demand for canton flannels, and quota:ions are nominal. Iu cambrics and seliseas there is a steady demand from home dealers, aud prices are steady. Drills are quiet and lower. The priceoi dentins and cottonudes will be reduced a little to correspond with the prices of other goods. Woolen goods are unprecedented. The mild-weather of tlio entire season has largely affected business in woolen good.-*. The snort time of some mills and stopping of others ts somewhat favorable to a baiter market, and holders of goods show a better feeling. Delaines and liuseys are Iu only modenite supply, but sufficient for I)resent light trade. In cloths and cassimcrs ?ut few goods are called for excepting leading styles for immediate manufacture into clothing or some other grades for ready made clothing lor spring trade. The market for . foreign goods shows a slight improvement from lighter importations, and a rather more prevailing demand consequent tipon lower prices. Fashionable styles of goods are steady and not very abundant, but most other goods are very low.
