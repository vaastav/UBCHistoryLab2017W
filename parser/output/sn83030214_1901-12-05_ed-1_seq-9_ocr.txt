THE MESSAGE ABROAD. gEBJfAN, AUSTRIAN AND BRITISH COM JIENT- THE MONROE DOCTRINE. Berlin. Dec. 4.— The officials of the Foreign Office h« re make : a special application of Presi dent Roosevelt's definition of the Monroe Doc trine in ■* Message t0 Congress to Germany's d is[Uf with Venezuela. A Foreign Office offi cial intimated to the correspondent of The As sociated Pres« to-day that while a friendly ad jastment. of Germany's claims is still expected. a forcible settlement might become Germany's duty at no distant date. Such a settlement, if gpefFary would not Infringe on the Presi dent'" policy, " r offend the United States in the le*st p»rt*al«r. ir!iCi;il also said that the President's iir.nii? ra ' ] " views were not of special interest ,jem .iry now, because the emigration to .Africa was inconsiderable. VJenn. Th-<\ .— Discussing President Roose xeli's Mersage to Congress, the Austrian papers ar e unanimous in pra-sing the references to an- Mttfc**, ■ v*u * on other points they are not quite so laudatory. The •"Fremdenblatt" comments on its peace ful tone, remarking that President Roosevelt evidently will not allow himself to be carried gwß v by senseless chauvinists. Th<- -Xeue-Wiener Tageblatt" dwells on Its •imperialistic character," adding: There lives in America a spirit, as an "ap pendat.i ' to the Monroe Doctrine formula. of Eur ■■■ for the Americans, and this formula, al though clad in the most peaceful phrases, per vades the Message. Th» "Deutacfce Volksblatt" declares that the policy ennadatal must expand American pro ducti'iv 'iid therefore "measures for the pro tection of Austrian production are required by the ih tatf of self-preservation." Th- Austrian Volks-Zeitung" believes that the strength of the Message lies in the modera ta t..!>-. adding: It ppeaks in the language of a strong man who knows he requires no sonorous words to be bei-rd. The "Xeue-Wiener Journal." also dealing with the power of the Message, recommends its close study, so as to "find means, at the proper time, of sr>..;];r:r his game." The "Wi-ner Morgan-Zeitung," following simi lar lines, declares that the governments of all civilized States will only too soon recognize the ■I— r rili danger that these measures con stitutf for the commercial policy of foreign ctmm'-r.i'ier-. London. Dec. 4.— President Roosevelt's Mes sa^t- to Congress holds the first place in the afternoon newspapers here to-day. The com ment tm it. however, differs little from that of the morning papers. Strong, general approval of the pronouncement, which, as "The St. ■Vsses*s Gazette" says, "strikes notes of con- Edous strength and assured success," is the pervading tone of the editorials. "The spirited declaration for Monroeism will cause a flutter in Europe." says "The "West mirster Gazette," which continues: If the Kaiser is really of the opinion, as al leged, that "the American Peril" is the question sf the future for Europe, he will find confirma tion in the Message. He will envy Secretary Ga^.'s surplus of £15.000.000 available for liuild ing ironclads or other purposes, for the Ameri can doctrine backed by the American surplus means that many European ambitions in South America are foredoomed to failure. V»'e do not doubt that it is the policy of this country, if called upon to make a choice, to stand by the United States m defence of the doctrine. We are also an American power, and it was we who first suggested the idea. After noting that South America, the on'y outlet Ear the surplus population of Europe, is largely in the possession of the -orrupt Spanish, over wh'.ni the I'nited States throws its aegis ■without guaranteeing good government, "The Wfjtminster Gazette" concludes: It is r.ot easy to affirm this in the interests of mankind, ami -*\ h- :i the- Tniu-d States, after ■warning Europe sot to enter America, proceeds itself to step out from the American continent, even a theoretical defence is difficult. The situ ation has the germs cf an immense controversy ir. the future.

Mexico City, Dec. 4. — President Roosevelt's Message has been favorably received in government and business circles. The general comment is that his declaration in favor of Cu ban independence and a free trade policy with the island will greatly strengthen American prestige all over Latin-America, and that he has disarmed the clerical press of one of its prin cipal arguments against the Washington gov ernment. "The Mexican Herald" to-day says of ihe Message: It? sound Ffnpf and remarkable comprehen ■ are matcher, by its remarkably high lit 881 ;ua'iity. It is a message following which P&tr: tic Americans and all lovers of human - - ran take their s-tand on a platform of souri-i and invigorating principles.

There was an earlier will, executed on February 18, 1V.»1, under which W. K. D. Stokes, a cousin of the deceased, is made pole executor. The admission to probate of the later will was contested by w. B. D. Stokes on a number of ground?. Under the first will Nancy Stokes. the mother of Edward B. Stokes, who died before him: Mrs. Mary J.

The only witnesses exam ined were the subscribing witnesses to the l s '.'4 ■will, Charles Plattner. a director of th" Hoffman House, and George VV. Cornish, a former secre tary of E. S. Stokes. The testimony of the witnesses went t<> show that the will was executed at the office of the Hoffman House on March 22, 1891, and that at the time the testator was of suur.d mind and free from restraint. Mr. Hughes filed a letter of objection to the issuing of letters of administration to Mr. I.i-ary, one of the executors. There were a number of reasons stated, the chief one beinp that the testator had wanted to eliminate him as a:i executor under the will. The Surrogate said that this would have to be argued under a separate action, but con sented that no letters should be issued until Mr. Leary had been examined.

The first general mis sionary conference In the history of the Protestant Episcopal Church in this country opened here this morning for a four day meeting. The importance of the gathering has brought together the leading churchmen of the country. Bishops and ministers, deacon? and laymen have come, from the Pacific Coast, the far Southwest, and even from Brazil, to discuss the missionary interests of their Church. Although this is the first day, nearly two hundred clergymen have already arrived. " The present conference is held at a critical time ir the history cf the Church, which is questioning the advisability of branching out Into new fields or making agsrressive progress in the present mis sionary jurisdictions. This is particularly true in the matter of the new bishopric in. the Philippines, and the discussion of the move is being awaited with great Interest. ■ To-day has been given up to devotional exercises. An early celebration of the Holy Communion was held in Christ's Church, followed by an elaborate service with a sermon in St. Luke's Church. The ]{f-v William D, Wr.lker. Bishop of Western New- York was celebrant, nnd he also delivered the address <>f welcome. The Rev. Dr. William B. Undine reci.ir of the Church of the Saviour, Phila delphia", preached the sermon.

YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1901. ANOTHER MAX IX A BOX. THE DRAMA. LYCEUM THEATRE. The course ir. the dramatic expression of path ology was continued last night at the Lyceum Theatre. The occasion was the rirs* performance of a new play by Clyde Fitch, called "The Girl and the Judge." Mrs. Stanton was a thief. She was "caught with the goods" when she lived in Ncw-Y.rk. where Messrs. Arnold. Constable & Co. Inconsiderately mad- a fuss because some lace belonging to them was found in her muff. It was nothing to them that she stole as the birds sang, no! because she wouM, but because she must. This drove poor Mr. Stan ton to drink, a happiness which all men have wh<>n everything else has cone against them. With their daughter they then went to a new place, further West, and t"ok a new name, that of White. Ilut when they t;..- off the ears Mr. White, alias Stan ton, could bear livinu with a thi.T no longer, and Mts White, alias Stanton, wondered how she had live.! with a drunkard so long. The only real disagre nun' between them was as to win. h BhouM keep the daughter. Neither <«r them cared to bring court proceedings and nothing was further from thn thoughts of either than to tell the truth. Bo an umpire was needed. They could not ask the corner barkeeper to decide, be cause he would be prejudiced In favor .>f the hus band. and the pawnbroker on the opposite corn-r was Ineligible, because of a like prejudice In favor of the wife, bo they went t.. <;e,.rK" Buckingham Chartris, who was doing business in the town as ;i Judge. Their can was q.iite unofficial and unprofes sional, and. as then- w:i n" sasfl before ;!.•• court ar.d as he was not consulted as counsel for either Side, be heard half the case ; ; r:d th. ii walked off and told them to settle it among themselves, Th» daughter then decided that sh-- would stay with her mother, who promised not to Hteal if sho could he!n it. and to pay frtquent visit? to her fattier. who agreed to keep sober If convenient. The ;: | ■:■ und daughter hired a room at the house of Mrs. Brown. The mother of the judge had received c letter from ■ Mead i» New-York about the coming of the Stan tnns, then a dispatch and then another letter, which last her son destroyed unread, lest It should contain something which his mother ought not to s.-e. having lirst paid two i ents* which was dIM for extra postage. The moth, r, having thus been lr> troduced to three stantons who did not appear, called on the Whites, who did appear, bseaose there were three of them, and that was the best she BOUld do. She showed B pin whi.-h the Judge hatl given her. and Mrs White s. creted It and trotted off to the pawnbroker's with it. while the rest of tin- people in the play were taking up the stair carpet. The Judge then came -md to- Msted that Miss Whit.- should be his wife. She was only t • >- . glad, bui regarded her mother as an obstacle Lying awake at mid night. sh«- a*-, used her mother of stealing the pin. She denied it at first, but. hearing the door bell ring, confessed all, and K«ve up the pawn ticket. The next day the party assembled al the pawn broker's, redeemed the pin and put to confusion tin- judge's secretary, the daughter of the land lady, whom Mrs while bad accused of taking the pin. Mr. and Mrs. White then determined, in the interest of their daughter's happiness, to go away togeth< r and to try still another place, in the com forting consciousness that there were plenty more places left, if the next one should also prove a failure. In delightful contrast with tl\e maudlin silliness cf tiu- i<lay was the reception accorded by the au dience to the actors who were the interpreters of it. There was not a part which was not well played, and most of the parts were acted by old and tried favorites, whom the aodienoe Kreetf-.; with afft— tionaU'-cheer and goodwill. Mrs. G. H. Gilbert, who will never lose the tove of the New-York public as loiik as it is permitted to see her. or as long as it can remember her, made the mother '>f the Judge a sweet and gentle personal ity, as captivating as all the rest of this actress's long list of stage portraits. Miss Annie Russell gave to thf part of the daughter all the charm which it could have. When she has MMBething better to do she can do it, but there was no more to be dune with a part Mkn this. Mi*s Emily Wake man improved the better dramatic opportunities of the mother. Mrs. McKee Hankin and Mme. Mathilde Cotlrelly were both capital, the former as the boarding house landlady, with sad memories of lost New- York society, and the latter as the keeper Of the pawnshop. Randolph Mordecai, as the judge's secretary, defended his mother like a gen erous and manly boy. and John Glendennlng was as dignified as the ridiculous position of the drunken husband of the thieving wife permitted him to be. Orrln Johnson, as the judge, was not enabled to show, except by his pleasing person, why the heroine should love him, but, assuming that she had reasons of her own, he sought and accepted her love grace fully. Robert Hlckman was as real as life as the judge's office man, and the cast was completed by Arthur Schwartz, i boy, who was equally lifelike as the unhopeful son of the pawnbroker. An ex cellent audience appreciated the acting- fully, and tittered when it co ild not help It at the play.

SXOW. came like glass, and the horses slipped every which way in their efforts to get around. In fact, about the only way they could navigate at all was by sticking to the cartracks. I dined with a friend in Madison-aye. last evening, and a great time I had of it getting back downtown. In the first place, the people who left the house before I did annexed my cab but left theirs in its place. Of course, it was art error and really made little difference, excepting that the cabman ut first refused to take me. but I at last showed him his error, and we starte<l on. I had to go to the Holland House, and this js the route we followed to get there. Down Madison ave. to Forty-second-st.. through Forty-secona-st. to Sixth-aye.. down Sixth-aye. to Thirty-fourth-st.. then down Broadway to Twenty-mnth-st. and across that street to Fifth-aye., by which we went to the hotel. , .  "It was a circuitous but necessary route, tor, o> following it, we were ab'- to stick to the car tracks and the horse could make fair progress. The poor brutt skatt-d so when he struck the ice covered asphalt of Fifth-aye. that it took him al most as long to cover the block from Twenty ninth-st. to Thirtieth-st.. as it had for him to come from Forty-second to Twenty-ninth-at." "Not only that, but when we got to the Holland House, the cabman utterly refused to drive to the curb, on the ground that if he did THE WAY his unfortunate horse could never TO TREAT drag that cab ur> the slight in- HORSES. cllne to the centre of the street again. I guess he was right, but for all that, I cannot see why. when such weather as the present sets in. the cab and stable men of the city do not have their horses sharp shod, so that they" would not slip. They would save money, both in the time they would thus economize in petting about and in preventing the unfortunate animals from seriously straining or injuring them selves, by slipping or falling. On such a day as yesterday the chapter of horse accidents in mis city must have been a voluminous one The £»ew- York of to-day is tc a great extent asphalt paved and horse owners here would do well to take a up from the horse owners of Washington or Buffalo, the two Eastern cities that possess a greater sur face of asphalt paved streets than New-\ork does. In either city such a storm as yesterda> *f>uUl send the horses of the town to the bla.-ksmith shops in search of sharpened shoes.
