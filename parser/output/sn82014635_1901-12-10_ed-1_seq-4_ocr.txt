"Down with the anarchists" is a cry now being echoed and re-echoed around the world, a refrain that is being sustained in the prints and discussed in legislative halls everywhere. But what is an anarchist? Who is he? Where is he? These are questions which are being found hard to answer. Only after he has cropped out as an as sassin, or has been caught in some overt act, are we sure of him. When it comes to drawing a legal definition, or to giving such a definition as would do for the basis of a law, the problem becomes a difficult one. The teachings of Tolstoi, Krapotkin and other socialists who dream of a personal freedom in which there shall only be a minimum of legal restraint, of an ideal society without rulers where all shall be on a level and brothers, may be impractical, they may be but dreamers, yet the teachings of these in spire tho Emma Goldmans and the Herr Mosts, from whose ranks spring the Czolgoszes, the Guiteaus, et aL Un questionably there is a line between the socialist and the anarchist, be tween the progressionist and the assassin, but who can define it in such legal terms as will prove constitutional? In short, is there any sure and compre hensive way for getting rid of anarchists, and of possible assassins other than by classing all such people as crim inals, or as insane, and putting them en masse into asylums or into penal institutions? Following the assassination of the president of the French republic the United States congress came within a single objection, made under the rules, of passing a law against anarchy, which would in all probability have saved the life of McKinley by making a Czolgosz improbable, ; If not impossible. It was a non-partisan measure and both houses and all the committees to which it had been re ferred were unanimous in Its favor, but a New York con gressman, by the name of Warner, who had other fish to fry, or who represented a faction which the bill would hit, objected to its unanimous consideration, so it was lost I seems that every attempt in the past to nationally legis late against anarchism has been frustrated by minorities j who have deigned no explanation. But the people of the j United States are so unanimously demanding a congres-j sional enactment, now, that some measure more or less definite and drastic may be looked for. A number of bills have already been introduced and others proposed. Speaking of the difiiculty found in defining anarchism, the North American Review of this current month is largely taken up by prominent statesmen in the discussion of this problem wliich Interests all governments, whether republics, kingdoms or absolute monarchies. The mostj comprehensive or learned disquisition, the one getting nearest the pith of the matter, in our estimation, as it is the one wnich most nearly shows how difficult it is to j define the anarchism which breeds assassins, is from the pen of Spain's ambassador to the United States. Spain i a a monarchy has been struggling with this problem for centuries. The writer holds that a single country can cope with the trouble, but that, by united international effort, through the police forces of all, this menace to life and to all legally constituted government, may be suppressed, if not entirely obliterated. Anarchism, in being Inspired by a hatred of tyranny In part, or being based on the idea that any government for intelligent human beings is an unneccessary burthen, is at bottom the child of a partial edcuation. There is no more danger from the man without any education than from the man with a liberal education, so far as anarchism goes. The anarchist, if properly enlightened, would never turn assassin. 1 

THINGS ARE GROWN IN KANSAS, When It comes to the total value of annual aggregate results, to net profits of its orchards, fields and pastures, Kansas, in now ranking the average state, will In a very few years be recognized as among the leading agricultural states. Tho editor of "American Investments," a monthly journal of standard authority, devoted exclusively to the interests of American Investors, published in Buffalo, New York, in speaking of the "corn belt," says Incidentally of Kansas: "So conflicting are the opinions of people regarding the latitude and longitude of tho 'corn belt,' that we very much question whether any two minds agree on tho subject. Tf here never has been and there is not now any rule by which the 'belt can be fixed, and when it has once been estab lished by general consent and approval, the lines are liable to be changed by altered agricultural conditions. If we are not in error, the state of Illinois boasted of having this 'belt' wholly within its borders, but now Iowa, Ne braska, Missouri and Kansas have a good substantial flaim for it The fact is uncontroverted that during the iie years ending with 1900, much abused Kansas grew 5S7S.433.347 worth of wheat and corn, outranking all other plates, and as a strictly corn-producing state, Kansas ranks fifth on the list It is well not to 'sneer the lip when speaking of Kansas. Things are grown there." v o , s RELIABLE ANECDOTES OF M'KINLEY. Stories about President McKinley are now being col lected from every ' possible source. The result is a most thrilling and varied illumination of a well-loved character. Among the newest anecdotes' collected are the following: An. intimate friend, with whom he was chatting one day on the subject of his, will, remarked upon the small- ness of the president's estate; whereupon Mr. McKinley said: "No, I don't leave much, but what I do leave was honestly acquired, for it never cost anybody a tear or my country a penny." A number of senators were talking on the different forces and powers of the world, and the conversation drifted to' the subject of the heads of statest "I don't envy any one of-them the power which Providence has given to then," said the president "but there is one thing of which I may be allowed to boast, which is, I fear no man. I fear neither the revolver, nor the burglar, nor the spleen of an injured citizen" a curious and pathetic sentiment in the light of what occurred at Buffalo. Mr. McKlaley was a carefulreader; he slowly digested every line and every sentiment printed and expressed; that no doubt was the effect of his legal training. He cared little for fiction, but one day a friend caught him reading a popular novel and expressed surprise. "Well," said Mr. McKinley, "there's more reality about fiction than there is about fact and it takes me longer to read it than a state treaty. Come In in about a fortnight's time and you will .probably hear that I have got about half way through this book, and what I read I remember for a life time." Like the father of M. Loubet, president of the French republic, Mr. McKinley's mother shook her head doubt fully when she was congratulated on her son's ascension to the highest position in the v country. "I would rather William were a Methodist bishop than anything else in the world," she said. , The late president was, in his early life, intended for the ministry. When a lad of sixteen, his brother David, who was the superintendent of a coal mine, came into his room where William was studying his Latin grammar, and peremptorily ordered him to-harness his pony by a certain time in order to go to a dance. When he had gone, William turned around to his aunt and said: "Aunt don't you think it is humiliating for a Methodist to have to hitch up a horse for a brother to go to a dance?" A smart young lady on seeing the president rising to leave church after the service was over, broke all prece dent, and, standing upon one of the benchs, waved her lace handkerchief and called out "Three cheers for the president" The cheers thundered out in the sacred edifice and the president acknowledged them with becoming gravity. 

HOLD-UP OF THE RED ONION. BAD GRAMMAR A DISEASE. The recent visit to .Chicago of a number of Germans who are concerned about educational matters, is bringing results. Evidently they have informed the Berlin profes sors of the startling departure from traditional lines which has attracted the attention of the University of Chicago, and made life in the city by the lake less sombre than its pall of soft-coal smoke would Indicate. The Ameri can peril which menaces Europe is not exclusively indus trial, but includes the educational also; and just as the German manufacturers have adopted American methods, so the Berlin professors have been induced to enter into competition with tho original and entertaining professors at Chicago's educational midway. The hrst product of the German attempt at yellow school teaching was the announcement of Professor Zim mer that the world's penal systems are all wrong. That the person who murders another in a fit of fury should -not be punished, but on .the contrary, should bo embraced as having experienced a moral purification. The Herr Pro fessor affirmed that man has within him a liability to smallpox and to anger. As vaccination will exhaust that upon which the disease seizes, so will great anger which ends in homicide exhaust a man's power of murderous intensity. In other words, a murder in passion is a moral bath, which leaves the murderer a better citizen and a better man than is he who has never washed his hands in human gore. The first effort to rival the sensationalism of the Chi cago professors Is highly creditable. It might almost have come from the lakeside university. The second attempt is even more successful. Professor Liebmann, who graces the Berlin University, affirms that bad grammar is a disease, like the mumps or rheumatism. To a people like the Americans, whq have been taught that drunkenness is a disease of the physical system which can be cured by squirting gold chloride under the skin, the idea of bad grammar as a malady should not be surprising. There Is no reason why bad spelling should not be included in the list of distinct ailments of the. brain and nervous system. The professor maintains that grammar is not an arbitrary creation of man, but is based on solid principles. It has been evolved from the noun, and could be nothing else than it is. He assumes that If there be other worlds in habited by sentient beings, their grammar must be our own. ROOSEVELT ON IRRIGATION. President Roosevelt in his message to congress, has presented an adjustment of the trouble ebtween Kansas nnd Colorado, as to the right of the use of the waters of the Arkansas river. Unintentionally, we believe, he gives the Jatter state two or three "jabs in the slats." which cer tainly will force her to the realization that her present at titude in this matter is not justifiable. The chief executive recommends that congress take such Treasures as will lead to the construction, of im mens1 reservoirs at the headwaters of the large streams, vheixin the flood waters can be stored, and in the dry Ecascns b? tarnld into nature's canals to take their natural court e to the sea.

The nisht it happened -was a dull one at the Red Onipn, because there was a, shindig up at Moll Doyle's and all tho high-flyers were there bent on making" a night of it. At midnight cuuek Ken nedy let his har-tender and his two daalers go, got down off the lookout, shut' up the faro box and the stud-poker deal and said to the few players in the, room: "Here, fellows, 'f you want to play It's got to be rouletio.'r nothing. Far as Fm concerned I'd as lief shut up." Then to Hitchcock, the young English man, whose play alone hud made the night worth while to the house: ".Luck again you, eh? How much 'r you out?" "More than I care to say," murmured Hitchcock, slipping his pile into his coat pockets and standing' up. "I'm hit hard. Chuck, but if you don't mind I'll bet a few on the wheel." Two of the players dropped out and slunk out of the lamp-lighted room. A Mexican tanner, who smelled of his trade, Connolly, the one-eyed hack driver, and Hitchcock were all that sat in at the' roulette board. They bet dollars where the Englishman bet tens, and Chuck felt sorry for the stranger. "Better quit. Hitchcock," he growled as he swept another hundred off the board and split a stack of whites between Connolly and the Mexican. "Don't you never get tired losing? I'm tired o winning YOURnoney." The flushed, weary eyes of the for eigner looked at Kennedy's for a mo ment. "You can't win forever." he murmured drowsily. "I've got to get even, GOT to. Hear that, Mr. Kennedy?" The gamblor allowed that he "wasn't doaf," smiled sleepily and rolled again. This time Hitchcock cashed, but the Mexican and Connolly lost and quit. "They ought to be a load up to Moll's," said the hack driver, passing in his little pile of chips, "and I got to get busy. G'nlght, Chuck! G-'night, gentle men!" And out he walked, while the Mexican curled up in a chair to watch the game and Hitchcock built his towers of ivory on the red spots. He watched with fur tive eagerness the little ball as it whirred and spun around the moving groove, listened to It tinkling across the brass divisions, bounding In and out as it struck the sloping center and finally settled on the black! Kennedy reached for the Englishman's white castles in Spain and swept them into the drawer. The player's mouth was drawn and blue. He looked at the Mexican and then at Kennedy's white, nervous fingers. He glanced about the silent room. They were alone these three. Hitchcock made no move to play again. "All in?" queried Chuck. "I've got another hundred up at the hotel," drawled the Englishman. "If you'll just wait till " "Not on your life," blurted tha dealer. "I'm tired. I give you a run for your money and, as I told you first, 'taln't your night to win." "But I've lost nearly six thousand, Kennedy; I'm entitled to " "You're entitled to lose sixteen thou sand 'f you don't know when to quit. That's what. I'm going to bed. It's 2 o'clock.-" Kennedy took his pistol off ths edge of tho table and slipped it Into his holster. He -"drew a buckskin bag out of the drawer and dropped the "bank" and tho winnings Into it. It was a bad move. He should have put the money away before the pistol, but Kennedy was sleepy. His eyelids -were heavy, but he looked up when he heard the Mexican grunt and bawled: f "Git, greaser! Go to b-e-d?" with a rising inflection. He sa,w the Mexican's frightened eyes fixed on Hitchcock, and following their warning flash turned slowly round and looked quite narrowly into the muzzle of tho Englishman's six'shooter. "Drop the bag, Kennedy, If you please,", said the. .broken but deliberate gam bler. The bag, fat. w'ith his thousands of pa per and gold, chugged on the oilcloth top of tho roulette. "Look out!" a3 he saw Kennedy's hand swing slightly backward, "hold them up, higher, higher. That's It" "I bato to do r,it, Kennedy," said Hitchcock, backing? slowly toward tho door and holding: tils artillery level at the dealer's face?' VFact Is, the money wasn't mine.; belonged to sister, sick sister and I couldn't stand ' He was gone! In an instant Kennedy had out his gun and started for tho steps down which he heard Hitchcock bound ing. He had reached the hallway below just as the Englishman swung into the saddle. Tho pony, struck with the spurs, bounded away like a catapult. Then Chuck, tricked at his own oft practiced gun play, outwitted by a ten derfoot who hadn't been in camp two weeks, hoard the cluttering, far-off music of Old Moll's overworked piano, wonder ed If his glory would fado when the "gang knew," and, wondering, cursed tha empty pistol In his hand, the Mexican Who had slunk away and the Englishman already far out on tha mesa. But there was no hope for It but to organize pur suit. He saddled his own pony, and at daybreak he had turned over the "bus iness" to Sheppard, the faro dealer, and with Pat HIckey, the sheriff, and Butch Holiday, the foreman from Maxwell's, was off across the mosa after Hitch cock. "He's raakin' fur tho railroad," said HIckey, as the trio swept away across the wind-swept tables of sand, "just like a sneakin' tenderfoot." And sure enough at noon they were j riding in his tracks as they led into Jolla, a railroad station of four bouses, a ! corral and a water tank. Hitchcock had j stopped at one of the houses for a meal ' and drink, but "he never dallied a rain- j ute when he sot dona," said tha house wife, who Xept & sort of "fee parlor" J for cowmen. "He Just give the hoas a ! swally an started oil towards Plxcn j River."

OUTLINES OF OKLAHOMA. It will not bo very long until Kingfisher will bring out .a bright new capital am bition. One prominent paper in Oklahoma has never had a line about the governorship situation. y It is Chief Justice Burford's place that Judge J. J. Merrick Is seeking down in4 Washington. Captain Franz, of Enid, has no idea the amount of excitement he Is causing In Oklahoma politically. Tho Democratic papers are having a hard time in tha present racket to find some place to abuse Flynn. a he Anti-Saoon League is cutting all kinds of capers because it believes the new governor is a Prohibitionist. A good deal of the talk about the wholesale removal of officials in Okla homa is air cut out of the middle of July.' Slowly the Indian territory papers are getting on to the fact that abusing Ok lahoma is a poor way to help the Indian territory- Jorro Johnson, of Xewkfrk. 13 hunting through the Decline aad Fail of the Roman Empire to see if Clnclnnatus didn't have led hair. The man who caused the removal of Governor Jenkins, who is 'not an officer and is not known in the case. Is being "alluded at" a good deal. Efforts have been made to get Koosc vclt to express himself on the statehood question. But he will not. He made no reference to It in bis message. "Roosevelt's paralyzing mc," says an Oklahoma Populist. "Why. he's stirring things up just the way I wanted Bryan to do when he got to be president." The knockers have their hammers out against Judge Burford. and before they have pounded away at him long they will find they have stirred up a cy clone. Pretty strong language in the Mulhall Enterprise: "Mulhall merchants, that is, seme of them, complain of dull trade, God knows It Is not due to excessive ad vertising." There is a disposition in the territory, es evidenced by editorial utterances, to cut loose and rip things up the back. Public officials for a season should walk powerful soft-like. Your t'nele Jake Admire has written some mighty fine articles, but lie sur passed himself last week when he took up the Jenkins case and aleo directed a few remarks in the direction of the new governor. Tom Ferguson now says that a wholo lot of those early experiences the boys ore printing about him never happened. Probably he will deny building that well which was so crooked it came out on an adjoining hill-side. Walt Matthews, living near Mulhall. reports a monster panther in his neigh borhood. Ills shepherd dog tackled the beast after It had stolen a hog, and the dog was literally torn to pleoos. Then two of his bull-dogs took a hand and were- defeated. Tom Ferguson was twice appointed governor of Oklahoma. When he got down to Washington he found that he had been commissioned as Tom Fergu son. He had himself commissioned as Thompson Ferguson. He didn't want him self thrown out on a technicality. EI Reno American: El Reno and the county contiguous was visited at an early hour Sunday morning by the first snow storm of the season. The morning of Saturday opened with threatening clouds, but the weather was warm and did not forebode what was to follow later in the day. The wind changed during the after noon to the north and the atmosphere becamo much colder, continuing so until, in the fore part of the night, when It be gan to rain, sleet and freese. blight spurts of snow fell, but not until the after part of the night did the snow come In any large quantity. Yesterday moralng the ground was covered to the depth of several inches. However, it did not remain long, and by evening there was scarcely any to be aeen. 81SIS!(alSIll'''
