This proved to be the great day in the trial of E. L. Harper. Until after court opened it was not known whether Harper him self would become a witness or not. It has been said that his counsel pro tested against his appearance on the witness stand, and that he has firmly insisted that his interests demanded that he should tell his own story. At 10 o'clock the question was solved by Mr. Blackburn calling Mr. Harper to the witness stand. Before he took the oath the witness told his previous bus iness career, ending with the Fidelity National Bank, and went on to detail his connection with the idelity Na tional Bank. He said that in Septem ber, 188tf, he was induced by W ilshire to make him a loan of $63,000. Wil shire at that time was a debtor to the bank to the amount of fc:oo,000, and he represented to Harper that if this loan was not made tne uanK would suiter. He accommodated him upon taking an azreement to transter real estate and also 100 shares of the Fidelity Na tional Bank at par, then worth 100. All went well until in October when the witness returned from a little din ner party composed of Wilshire and some olhcers ot tne bank, and iound that during his absence Wilshire, F.ck ert & Co's check for $26,000 on the First National Bank bad been returned not good. This check Wilshire said he was unable to make good, and the bank was compelled to carry it. An other day when the witness was out Wilshire. Eckert & Co.. cot Honkins to wire 900,000 credit to Chicago upon certified checks. At the close or busi ness hours that day he found Wilshire, Eckert & Co's account overdrawn $60,- 000, with the former $2tt,0O0, their debt to bank of $200,000 and their debt to him of $65,000. He felt that they were in a dangerous position. Wilshire transferred to him the real estate and stock, which he turned over to the bank. He stormed at Wilshire, but could get nothing out of him. He then suggested to the cashier to call a loan irom wiisnire, ncKert x tjo.. to square their account, and save the cashier. In answer to direct questions from Mr. Blackburn Mr. Harper stated un reservedly that he never gave an order of any kind to Mr. Eckert to buy grain for him in Chicago, and he was equally sweeping and explicit in Baying that he never authorized Mr.- Wilshire to buy grain for him in Chicago, or elsewhere. This is the point of the whole case and is in direct conflict with the testimony of both Mr. Wilshire and Eckert. Mr. Blackbuin then took up the ac counts of the bank with the First Na tional Bank of New York and the Chemical National Bank of N ew York, where large balances were carried, and Mr. Harper was called on to explain all these transactions. lie did so with great minuteness, referring often to the books of the bank, in- general nis excuse for irregularities was that the bank was put into troume oy w usnire, Eckert He Co.'s debt, and he used what ever methods he could to save the bank and tide over the affairs. His testi mony was not ended at the noon ad journment. Hamer's manner on the stand show ed what a difficult man he has been for his attorneys to manage. He took the jury into his confidence, and talked to them with the purpose of convincing them, but all the time was transgressing the rules of evidence, as explained to him time and again by judge Jackson. He argued his case as he went along, until Judge Jackson's rebukes began to bear the tones of impatience. He testified a dozen times to occurrences which he did not witness, but of which somebody had told him. Every ques tion furnished a new opportunity for him to say what his intentions were. It Beemeu line presumption, auer Harper's sweeping denial, that he had ever in any way oruereu wusuireio buy wheat lor him in Chicago or else where, for his counsel to hand him three notes bearing the initials O. K., E. L. II.. and ask him to explain them. Harper went on to Bay that when Wil shire in March still owed the bank and him those large sums, he insist ed on his selling out his wheat deals so as to pay his debts. Y ilshire said to do so safely he should buy some that day to keep up the market, and then he could sell out to advantage the next da: "lie asKed my advice, saia narper, 'and I cave it. I said to him: 'Make out your order to buy June wheat, and if it's all right, I'll O. K. it.' Mr. Wilshire sent to tne uaiiK tins note that he was going to buy that day $180,000 worth of wheat, and I O. K.'d it. It was no act or account of mine in any shape or form. The books of the bank will show, I think, that he paid the bank a considerable amount ot money the next day. 1 had no purpose whatever in this transaction except to get the money for the bank that was owing to it by Wilshire." The second note was in cipner. anu Harper said it related to the same sort of transaction. The third note he explained by say ing that Wilshire told him he had to pay lor a lot or wneat in .may. "lie wanted me," said Harper, "to furnish money for this purpose." I refused. He said I would e sorry. I advised him to sell May wheat and buy June and pay the difference. He asked me to write a memorandum of a telegram to that effect saying: Please change that May wheat. I have not provided ior June ana juiy. .iy principal has decided, etc.' Mr. Wil shire) represented to me that he was buying largely for Cleveland parties. and tu at is wnat l suppose ne reierreu to in the words: 'My principal.' The witness then asked permission to explain a check of Wilshire's for $10,000 in October, but was stopped by the court. He waa then asked if it was given for a wheat deal. He answered: "No;" that it was given to pay bonds wnicn wiisnire naa nvDOthecated without authority. Here the court stopped him, and cautioned him to answer questions ana not go into irrelevant matters, but he again lapsed so far as to tell that Wilshire had gone to Cleveland to get help from his brother-in-law, and had come back with nothing, and later that Wilshire had mortgaged property ior sno.uou and explained to him that he did so to make good that sum of money Bunk by him in wheat taken from his father's estates. He explained also how he dis counted Lewis' note at wiisnire 's sug gestion, and after again denying that a dollar or the Dames money or nis went into the wheat deal, went on to tell of the crash, how Wilshire and Hop kins followed him to Bowman's where he dined, and with tears in their eyes begged him to let them have more money. He had refused Wilshire that morning, jiop&ms suggsieu tele graphing to a bank in Chicago to see how much they would take to carry the deal tnrougn. iiopmns sent such telegram to the American Exchange liana, unicago. wnen tne witness re turned from dinner he found a tele gram on his desk from that bank saying tnat ii w usnire was mere next morn ing with $000,000 it would be safe That was where Kershaw & Comnanv had their account. He told how Wil shire, Hopkins and he taked the mat ter over aud decided that they would save the bank. Hopkins had a letter of credit drawn for $200,000 and four drafts on the Chemical Bank of New York for $ 1 00,000. Wilshire was afraid to carry the money lest it be attached, and it was arranged that Gahr should go with him. Gahr was instructed to not give up the monev without a guarantee. Next morning he repeated this warning iy a telegram and was answered that it was too late. He then stopped payment on the drafts. tie became anected at this point and wiping his eyes, went on to say how he pus an ilia money into tne oanK to save it, only to see the other directors walk in and check theirs out. Only Zim merman, of all the directors, offered any assistance. Then the government came in, tne end was readied - Ihe counsel next asked in detail wiiemer ne naa ever nad or or dered any wheat - transaction with various broker in Chicago, naming them, tnd he returned t tie same answer. ' w. . in earusry itssT. lie had a conwrss. 0H with ifopHna about tfo Irwin, to-day denied a sentenced to one without a fine. Green & Co. matter, and told him he thoncht it waa dishonest. Here again the court stopped the witness from de tailing conversation about the 9285,000 transaction with the Fidelity Bank; he had no knowledge whatever until told of it in jail at Dayton. Hopkins had transactions through lloyt witn -Kershaw & Co., and he was trying to hedge arainst our losses by Wilshire. "I had loaned money to Hopkins,', said the witness, "and paid drafts for him, but I used my own money, and never took a penny out of the bank's funds for this purpose. Hopkins went in 960.000 with another broker' and I helped him. This was paid back and the money went into the bank. There was also some profit. This also was a hedging operation." The witness was then examined as to the assets of the Swift Iron & Steel Works, the Biversdale Boiling Mills, the firm of . L. Harper & Co., and of himself. He made the aggregate several mil lion dollars, and said all the transactions of these several firms and companies with the Fidelity Bank were legitimate. His evil genius seemed to have come to him at the very last. He waa now about to leave the stand. Mr. Black burn again asked him if he had any thing to do with Mr. Ilopkin's wheat deals through Broker Uoyt. He answered that he paid Ilopkin's draft but he did it to protect the bank. "I waa interested through Ilopkin's to that extent. We wanted first to protect the interests of the bank, and after that was done if there was any profit left, it was to be divided between Ilopkin's and myself." A sensation ran through the court room as these words were uttered. Mr. Blackburn, to break the force of the admission asked: "Did you at any time have any intent in all these trans actions to defraud the bank or anybody else?" "None in the world,'.' was the an swer. Miss Matthews at this point was ob served to be in tears. The cross-examination was brief and pointed. It brought out the single fact that he purchased certificates of deposit with bis own checks, which were not charged to ins second ac count. Two or three other witnesses, Mr. Gahr, Mr. Richards and Mr. Wood rough, were called mainly to tell about Harper's assets, but the government's counsel dismissed most of them with out cross-examination, or by drawing irom mem some uainaguig testi mony. The only comfort obtained was in the testimony of Mr. Marchant of the First National Bank, who show ed that Harper had large deposits in that bank in 1886 and in 18S7. Tae testimony is not quite closed but certainly wlu be to-morrow. The Ives Cua. Chicago, Dec. 10. Henry L. Ives made a somewhat mysterious visit, to Chicago yesterday, registering at the hotel as Henry Ironton and his at torney. Barrister Boone, registering as II. S. Booming. Mr. Ives used the greatest discretion in his attempts to Erevent his presence being known, ut finally admitted that the United States court at Indianapolis had issued an order restraining President McKeen of the Terre Haute and Indianapolis railroad company from disposing of the stock of that company, which was held collateral to secure the payment of a note of 9660,000 given by him. It will be alleged that the note that he had given was signed by him as trustee, and Mr. Ives said that he simply acted as trustee in that trans action and therefore signed it in his official capacity. He did not think there would be any official trouble ac cruing to himself, hut he was sorry to learn that McKeen had got himself, in to any difficulty on his account. He hoped to secure an extension of time in the pending litigation and if that was granted be would make eveiything straight. He denied that he had stripped the treasury of the Cin cinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Rail road company of its available cash last June, but asserted that he had paid to the treasurer or the com pany over $600,000 to meet the claims against him. He claimed that the directors could see that he was kept harmless against any suits that might be brought against him. He was not afraid of any criminal prosecution and defied any one to affix any culpable or financial responsibility to him on ac count of his connection with the C. II. & D. railroad. He said he was per fectly prepared to meet all his accusers, but he might want a little more time in order to collect his facts, summon bis witnesses and properly arrange his de fense. . - - Other Crimen and C&anmlUes.

The annual report of the chief of the secret service division of the treasury has been made public. It shows that there were 355 persons arretted by the officers of the service during the past fiscal year, for violation of the laws against counterfeiting, etc. Of this number seventy were convicted ana sentenced to imprisonment. The re port says that the counterfeiting now being done is principally the work of Italians, wno operate in nanus in dif ferent portions of the country. The counterfeiting done during the past year amounted practically to nothing, the only attempts in that direction toe ing a 910 silver certificate ana a W sil ver certificate, and these were sucn poor imitations as to be practically harmless.

RECOMMENDS A RAISE. Washington, . Dec 8. Secretary Fairchild has recommended that the salary of the assistant treasurer at St. Louis be raised to so,uuu per annum. treasurer's report. Washington, Dec. 7. The secreta ry of the treasury, in nis annual re port, submitted to congress to day, says that the total ordinary receipts of the government during tne year ena ing June 30, 1887, were 9371,403,277, and that total ordinary expenditures were $315,835,428, leaving a surplus of 955,556,849, which, with an amount drawn from the cash balance in the treasury of $24,455,720, makes a total surplus of $80,023,570, which was offer ed to the redemption of bonds. The receipts for the year show an increase of $34,963,550 over the present year; revenues are estimated at $383,000,000 and expenditures $316,817,715, leaving an estimated surplus 01 oo,ioz,zi. June, 30, 1888. The secretary esti mates the surplus for tne year 18S, at $56,469,236. The secretary gives the following ways in which the receipts and expenditures of the government may be made about equal: First. The purchase of the interest bearing debt of the government. Second. Larger expenditure by the government for other purposes than the purchase of bonds, so that they shall each year equal the taxation of that year. Third. Reduction of revenue from taxation to the amount actually re quired to meet the necessary expense. in regard to nrat pian tne secretary agrees with the President in his mes sage on tne same subject, lie tnen says: I cannot believe that it will adopt the second expedient. The third is the only fit remedy. One way is to reduce or aboiisn internal revenue tax ation. In favor of this is the fact that in a small part of the southern states the internal tax on liquor and tobacco is thought to be oppressive and is odious to people of those regions; and the further fact that by its reduction the expenses of its collection might be somewhat reduced. The chief cause for prejudice against the tax seems to be, that as there were no such tax be fore thCwar for the union, it is looked noon as a reminder of the measures adopted to raise money to carry on the war, and which ought not to be contin ued m tune of peace, and as lnterter ing in some way with natural rights of mankind to grow grain ana tobacco and manufacture therefrom spirits, cigars, snuff and various forms of merchantable tooacco. ui course tax ation of whisky and tobacco trespasses no more upon tne material ngnts 01 man than does taxation 01 nis ciotmng, on his bedding, on every implement which he uses in cultivation 01 nis grain and tobacco and in the distill ation or manufacture of same. The burden of one tax is direct, known, fixed. The whole of it goes into the government treasury. The burden 01 the other is indirect and unknown and only a portion of it comes to the treas ury. That internal taxation of spirits and tobacco began aunng tne war is no reason why it should be done away with now if it be in itself wise. So the fact that the rates of customs and tavat inn vera raised during the same war far higher than ever before in our history and have been continued until now. ought not to determine the man ner of their treatment. This should rather depend upon what is just and expedient at tne present tune, abu the expense of collecting internal revenue, I suggest that the amal gamation of the customs and internal revenue system is entirely feasible and thereby many offices might be abolished. To do away with the whole revenue from internal taxes at present would so dimmish the revenues that it would oe necessary eitnerto levy duties on articles of importation now free, sucn as tea and conee, or to suspend the sinking fund requirement, and also materially diminish other ex penses of the government. But it is not well either to abolish or reduce in ternal revenue taxation. It is a tax upon whisky, beer and tobacco, things which are in a very small measure necessary to the health or happiness of mankind, ibis tax is the least bur densome, least unjust of all taxes which the government lays or can lay neon tne people, it should not aboiisn. nor should it be reduced if. with due regard to the existing conditions of laoor and capital, sumcient reduction can be made in the taxation of neces sary articles which are in daily use of all people. Revenue from customs tax ation is where reduction should be made and while reducing, advantage should be taken of the opportunity to reform the abuses and inequalities of tariff laws. Add to the free list as many articles as possible, reduce du 1 ties upon every dutiable article to the - 1 lowest point possible, une surplus au 1 money wnicn is in tne treasury -.swuswi on pcemptST jst, to 253.701.19. and will amount to about 140,000,000 by Jane 30th. - If taxation is diminished to such an extent that annnal revenues will be less for some years to come than the appropriations, tne accumu lated surplus would be used for the ordinary expenses and people wouia gain urn greatest possi ble good from it- Doubtless the pursuance of thfe plan he revenues would have so increased as to ud visual W

If however, it is thought better to at tempt to buy bonds with it, I should like to have specific authority given to the secretary of the treasury to do so. The report shows that the circulation of standard silver dollars has increased 910,464,905 during the past year. In regard to this the secretary says: "One of the most interesting facts shown by the foregoing statements is the de crease in number of standard silver dollars owned by the government andin creased use of same money by the peo ple in form of silver certificates. Pro vision should be made against the time when there may be more silver money than is required for the business of the country. The first symptoms of this will be increasing ownership of silver by the government. This increase will take place because the government pays to the people that kind 01 currency wnicn tney wisn to have, and receives from them that kind wnicn tney wisn to pay. con sequently the government will ac cumulate a form of money which the public least desires. There should al ways be in the treasury enough silver besides that held against outstanding certificates to enable the government to at once supply any demand for it on tne pare 01 tne people, dui au neia in the treasury in excess of that amount is absolutely useless for any purpose, and in fact a menace to the silver which the people bold and also the United States notes and national bank notes to the whole circulating medium, except gold, it would be part of wis dom to prevent any accumulation of silver in the treasury beyond a suffi cient reserve needed to meet any de mand which may be made for it. This can be done by fixing of such revenue and providing that where it is exceed ed by, say 95,000,000, the purchase of bullion shall cease until the amount held by the government again equals such revenue. Another plan would be to provide that when the reserve was exceeded, an amount of United States notes equal in value to such excess should be 'canceled if enough of them were in the treasury, but if not then the purchase of bullion to cease until the maximum revenue should be reached. This would create a vacuum in the circulating medium which would be filled by silver. The amount of Uni ted States notes would be gradually reduced until the whole were extin guished. Silver dollars or silvei certi ficates would take the place of United States notes as they were retired. This plan would make our currency more uniform and secure, as now neitner 01 these plans if adopted, would diminish the actual or potential use of silver as currency by a dollar; in my judgment it would be promoted thereby.

He was led off by the police. 

BLAINE'S VIEWS. He XHfftn With the President en Be- dnclBK the He-venue. New York; Dec. 8. The Tribune to-day contains a long interview with Hon. James G. Blaine on President Cleveland's message. It was taken in short hand under the direction of the Tribune's Paris correspondent and sent by cable. It is as follows. I have been reading an abstract of the president's message and have been especially interested in the comments of the London papers. Those papers all assume to declare the message is a free trade manifesto and evidently are anticipating an enlarged market for English fabrics in the United States a consequence of the presidents recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamps the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." "You don't mean actual free trade, without duty." aueried the reporter. "No." replied Mr. Blaine, "nor do the London operators mean that. They simply mean tnat tne president nas recommended what in the United States is known as a revenue tariff, re jecting the protective feature as an ob ject, and not even permitting protec tion to result freely as an incident to revenue duties." I don't know that I quite compre hend that last point," said the reporter. "I mean," said Mr. maine, "tnat ior the first time in the history of the United States, the president recom mends retaining the internal tax in or der that the tariff may be forced down even below the fair revenue standard. He recommends that the tax on to bacco be retained, and thus that many millinna nnnna.11v shall be levied on a I domestic product which would far bet - tercome from a tariff on foreign fab rics." "Then do you mean to imply that you would favor the repeal of the to bacco tax?" Certainly. I mean just that," said Mr. Blaine. "I should urge that done at once before the Christmas holidays. It would in the first piae bring great relief to the growers of tobacco all over the country and would materially lessen the price of the article to con sumers. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The president calls it a luxury, but it is a luxury in no other sense than tea and coffee are luxuries. It is well to remember that the luxury of yesterday becomes a necessity of to day, watcn. 11 you piease. tne num ber of men at work on the farm, in the coal mine, along the railroad, in tne iron foundry or in any calling and you will nna vo 01 iuu cnewing while they work. After each meal the same proportion seek the solace of a pipe or a cigar, x nese not only pay the millions of the tobacco tax, but oav on every plug and every cigar an enhanced price which the tax enables the manufacturer and retailer to em- pose. The only excuse for such a tax is the actual necessity under which the government found l we 11 during tne war and the years immediately following. To retain the tax now in order to de stroy the protection which would in- ddently now from raising the same amount 01 money on foreign imports is certainly a most extra I ordinary policy for our governmentJ j - "Well, then, Mr. Blaine, would you "AO, I would B0t Vzev focsidsra. taons than those of a financial admin istration are to be taken into account with regard to whisky.- There is a moral side to it. To cheapen the price of whisky is to Increase the consumption enormously. There would be no sense m nrtnnar thn reform wmnirhfc Kw hh license in many states if the national n n ..wmkmw 4UAU government neutralized the effect by making whisky within the reach of everyone at twenty cents a gallon. Whisky would be everywhere distilled if the surveillance of the government were withdrawn by the remission of the tax, illicite sales could not then be pre vented, even by a policy as rigorous and searching as that with-which Russia pursues the nihilists. It would de stroy high license at once in all the states. Whisky has done a vast deal of harm in the United States. I would try to make it do some good. I would use the tax to fortify our cities on the seaboard. In view of the power ful letter addressed to the democratic party on the subject of fortification by the Mr. Samuel J. Tilden in 1885, 1 am amazed that no attention has been naid to the subject by the democratic admin istration. Never before in the history of the world has any government al lowed great cities on the seaboard, like Philadelphia, New York. Boston. Bal timore, New Orleans and San Francis co, to remain defenceless." "But," said the reporter, "you dont think we are to have war in any direc tion?" Certainly not." said Mr. Blaine "Neither, I presume, did Mr. Tilden when he wrote his remarkable letter, but we should change a remote chance into a absolute impossibillity if our weak and exposed points were strongly fortified. If to-day we had, by any chance, even such a war as we had with Mexico our enemy could procure iron-clads in Europe that would menace our - great cities, with de struction, or lay them under contribu tion." "But would not our fortifying now possibly iooe as if we expected war?" " Why should it, any more than the fortifications made seventy or eighty years ago by our grandfathers, when they guarded themselves against suc- cessiui attacs rxom tne armaments 01 that day e we don't necessarily ex pect a burglar because we lock our doors at night, but if by any possibility a burglar comes, it contributes vastly to our peace of mind and sound sleep to reel tnat ne can t get in." "But after fortifications should be constructed would you still maintain the tax on whisky?" "Yes," said Mr. Blaine, "so long as there is whisky to tax, I would tax it. and when the national government should have no use for the money I would divide the tax among the federal with the specific object of lightening tax on the real estate The houses and farms of the whole country pay too large a proportion of the total taxes. If ultimately relief could be given in that direction it would, in my judgement, be wise and beneflcient. The policy some honest but misguided friends of temperance habe urged thas the gov ernment should not use money derived from a tax on whisky. My reply is that the tax on whiskv by the federal government, with iis suppression of all illicit distillation, and the consequent enhancement of the price, has been a powerful agent in the temperance re form, by putting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount of whisky con sumed in the united states per capitr to-day is cot more than forty per cent or that consumed thirty years ago." Official Call. Washington, Dec. 9. The follow ing call for the next national republi can convention has been issued by the national republican committee: To the Republican Electors of the United States. In accordance with usage, and obedi ent to the instructions of the republi can national convention of 1884, a national convention of delegated rep resentatives of the republican party will be he d at the city of Chicago, 111., on Tuesday, the 19th of June, 1888, at 12 o'clock, noon, for the purpose of nominating candi dates for President and Vice-President, to be supported at the next national election, and for the transaction of such other business as may be there presented.

JULES FLKKY SHOT The Late Candidate for.Lbe Presidency ...v..v.iugVj of France Called Outside the Chamber of Der cties and Shot He is Wounded Twioe. Neither of Which is Serious. John L. Su hvan Introduced to the Prince of Wales. Paris, 3. p. m. M. Ferry was shot at by a man named Aubertine. Au bertlne appeared in the hall of the chambers of deputies and asked to see both M. Ferry and M. Goblet. M. Goblet did not respond to Au- bertine's request for an Interview, but M. Ferry did and on his appearance Aubertine drew a revolver and fired three times at him. It is reported that one of the balls struck M. Ferry in the chest. This wound, how ever, is apparently not serious, as M. Ferry was able to proceed to the hospi tal, supported by friends. In reply to inquiries by friends as to the severity of his wound, he responded, "It is nothing." Aubertine has been arrested. 4 p. m. It has been ascertained that M. Ferry's wounds are slight and that the shots only grazed the skin after piercing his clothes. By-standers tried to lynch Aubertine after he had fired the shots but were prevented with difficulty from carrying out their in tention. Medical examination at the hospital, revealed that two of the bul lets struck M. Ferry, the first passed around the chest slightly penetrating the flesh and the second went through the nesny part ot me tmgn. The statement that a medical ex amination revealed that the second bullet went through the fleshy part of the thigh was incorrect, it struck Ai. Ferry on the right side near the lowest rib. causing a contusion, i ne thigh was not penetrated. M. Ferry's wounds are of the slightest character. The real name of nis assailant is Berckein. He is 20 years of age. He states that he is one of a band of twenty revolutionists. The band drew lots and it fell to him to commit the first crime. Berckein declares that he swore to kill M. Ferry. After his injuries had been attended to at the hospital M. Ferry returned to his home on foot.

Th" Harper Tr'al Cloaea. Cincinnati, Dec. 10. The dramatic scenes in the harper trial this morning kept the crowded court room in a hush of silence. Court was opened in the usual way. Harper appeared, accom panied by his wife and her Bister and his little boy, a fine looking little fellow of nine years. The testimony for the defense was virtually nothing. Edgar Stark, bank cashier, was called to tell of Timberlake's transactions, but it was ruled out. and Mr. Blackburn said "I will now inform the court that we have no further testimony." At 10:30 Mr. Harper and his counsel withdrew for consultation. Deputy Marshall Urner followed. In ten min utes Mrs. Harper was called out. The consultation was upon the question of submitting the case without ar gument. At 10:45 the parties all returned and jure, narper was carry ing her babe. She sat down beside her husband with the child on her knee.re- moved its white hood and displayed a head and face, fair hair, bright eyes, fine complexion and full round cheeks. There was a whispered consultation at the table for a minute or two, during which above the low hum of the crowd, could be flute-like tones of the baby's voice as it reached to the table after the papers, it was tne only piea offered, for its father, for when Mr, Blackburn arose he said that under the ruling of the court as to the evidence offered they had no more witnesses to offer. The government called Messrs Hynch and Harper, but the questions asked them had been asked before and they were ruled out. Mr. Burnett then said the government would rett.

To speak for the armies of the United States, at the reunion at Gettysburg, I would rather agree to any officer of the rank of colonel or above who served through the war as to such a represen tative of our soldiers.

Dun & Co., in their weekly review of trade, say: Legitimate trade continues fairly active for the season, though embar rassed in some branches by the fluctu ations in the speculative markets. Speculation in products, after a few days of wild advance, has taken a turn downward as the natural result of enormous sales to realize. With a rap idly expanding currency, money is gen erally easier than a week ago, though rates are still high at many points, and complaints of slow collections do not diminish. The agitation of the tariff question already begins to cause a re vision ot calculations ior the future in some departments. The sharp de cline in real estate speculations and prices at some southern and western points, tends to cnecK developments there, and subjects investment to some financial strain. Large sales of Bessemer rails at 918.60 are reported, and a sale of steel rails netting $31 at the mill has been made. Buyer's are still backward but some brokers openly offer below $32. Coal has declined about 1. Orders are slackening. v ooiens do not improve in demand and heavy goods open in some cases be low last year's prices, so that manufac turers are not encouraged to increase their purchases of raw wool which ap pears ratner weaicer. itaw cotton has declined an i but goods are held at recent advances. xne boot and shoe trade is large and promising, with exceptionally good payments, and cheaper material, but there is complaint that competition cuts down prices too lar. leather is weaker. The movement of freight westward shows an increase of 150.000 tons for November, and east bound shipements are increasing, but the bank exchanges of all cities outside ot .New 1 ork begin to fall below those of last year. The decline 01 all cities last week was 14.3 per cent, and outside of New 1 ork 2.0 per cent. At the most interior points trade is reported fair for the season, but collections are slow at Detroit, fair at Memphis and Omaha, and rather better at Kansas City. Money at Chicago is in unabated de mand at 7 per cent, and operators bid per cent lor lunds to carry products at interior towns. Though the money markets on the whole are easier, the pressure at speculative centers con tinues Wheat speculation reached 105.000 bushels for the week and prices ad vanced sharply, only to close a shade lower than a week ago. Corn and oats, in spite of the recent inaction, gain 3 and 151 cents for the week, und oil is unchanged. Coffee has advanced i cent and the excitement in minor metals has lifted copper U cent, and tin nearly 1 cent per pound, but reaction in pork pro ducts take prices a little lower than wees ago. The average in tood products since July 1st was a shade over 20 per cent on Tuesday. It is questioned whether the legitimate enect of a partial fail ure of crops has not been fully realized in prices, but the increasing supply of currency still tends to keep speculation alive. The business failures during the last seven days number for the United States 220, and for Canada 2H, a total of 2-54, compared with 244 last week, and 275 the corresponding week of. last year. Sadden Appearance of Water. Galena, 111., Dec. 8. The sudden appearance of water in many wells in southern Wisconsin that have been perfectly dry since the drouth of last summer has caused no little wonder among the people. The wells are filled almost to the top, streams run in abundance from the side hills and springs that have long been dry and creeks and small rivers, whose beds have been dry for months are gradually rising and bid fair to become 1 orm liable streams. The phenomanon occtired during a night and is similar to that reported from Sagamohd coun ty, this state and at Mattoon and vicinity. A Strike Ordered. I'lTTsncRO, Dec. 9.
