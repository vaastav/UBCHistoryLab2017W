For the fiscal year ended June 3 , lSi9. the Internal revenue receipts were increased aboul ine!.000,tJ. The present gratifying strength of the treasury Is shown by the fact that cn De cember I. IBS, the available c:ush balance was l78,l 437.7i of which :39.744. 5.:W was in frold coin nnd bullion. The conditions of confi dence which prevail throughout the country have brought oid into more general use aud cus loms receipts are now almost entirely paid In that coin. Increased activity in industry, with its wel come attendant a larger employment for labor at higher wajes pives to the body of the people a larger power to absorb the circulating me dium. It is further true that year by year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the in creasing volume or agricultural products, cot ton, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume el money supply. The National Hanking Act. In Its earlier history the national bankinx act seemed to prove a reasonable avenue thrn:h which needful additions to the circulation could from time to time be made. Changing condi tions have apparently rendered it now inopera tive to that end. Ti-e hiirh margin in bond se curities required, resulting from large premi ums which government bonds command in the market, or the tax on note issues, or both oper ating together, appear to be the inSuences which impair its public utility. The attention of congress Is respectfully in vited to this important matter with the view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modiScations can be made in the national banking act as will render its service in the par ticulars here referred lo more responsive to the people's needs. 1 aira'n urge that national basics be authorized to organize wiih a capital of f 5, 000. For the Gold Standard. I urgently recommend that to support the ex isting gold standard, and to maintain "the par ity in value of the coins of the two metals (ioid and silver) and the ec,ual power of every dollar atall times in the marke; and in the payment cf debts." the scc.etury of the treasury be (tiven additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The authority should include the power to sell bends on long and short time, as conditions may require, and should provide for a rate of Interest lower than that fixed by the act of January 14. 1S75. "hile there is now no commercial fright which withdraws gold from the government, but. on the contrary, such widespread confidence thct gold seeks the treasury demanding paper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the rreent as the most fitting tiice to make adequate provi sion to insure the continuance of the gold stand ard and cf public confidence in the ability and purpose of the government to meet all its obli gations in the money which the civilized world recognizes as the bet- The financial transac tions of the government are conducted upon a gold basts.

We are doing these things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are cot compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past, however, and may have to be done in the future- It be hooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and the best means are those which are the most certain and economical. Tho-e now au thorized have the virtue neither of directness or economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our financial plirht and embar rassment during the years 1'J3, l?y4. li"So and lsid. Our receipts now equal our expenditures; deficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remsvinin? cause by confer ring the full and necessary power oa the secre tary cT the treasury and impose upon him the dv:ty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity with each other, which is the repeatedly de clared policy cf the United States. In this connection I repeat my former recom mendations that a portion cf the gold holdings j-hall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presenta tion, but when once redeemed shall not there After be paid out except for geld.

The industrial ccrrmissic n. cr-j-ted ty the act of tLe congress of June 1". Ir.. has been engeged in exterdtd hearings upon the dis puted questit ns involved in the sulject t f com binations in restraint of tnde and ccmpetitio-x They have not yet completed th-ir investisra Uon cf this subject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive ar undetermined. The subject is one giTinj rise to many divergent views a-, to the nature and variety or cause and extent cf the injuries to the public which may resuit from large combi nations concentrating more cr less numerous enterprises and establishments, which previ ously to the formation cf the combination were carried on separately. It is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by sup pressing natural ani ordinary competition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common iaw, but also to the pu".:c welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations If the pre-.r.t law can be extended more certainly to control or checj these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. Whatever power the ccnress possesses over this most important sucject should be promptly ascertained and averted An act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by congress on the 2d of July, l-i.-- The pro visions of this statute are ccn.prthcr.sive and stringent It declares every contract cr com bination, in the form tf a trust cr other wise, or conspiracy in the restraint cf trade or commerce Dmong the several states or with foreign natrbns. to be unlawful. It denomi nates as a criminal sny person who make- any such contract or engages in any such corr.ir.r.a tion cr conspiracy and provides a punishment by fine or imprisonment. It invests the circuit courts of the United States with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violation- of the act snd makes it the duty of the several United Slates district attornevs, under the direcf.cn of the attorney general, to in-titute proceedings In equity to prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon any per-c n wno shiil be injured in his bu-ir.ess or property by any person or corporation by teasn of anything forbidden or declare-d to be unlawful by the act the power to sue therefor in any circuit court of the United States without reiect to the amount in controversy, and to recover three fold the damages by him sustain d ar.d the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees. It will be pe rceived that the act is aimed at every kind of combination in the nature of a trust or monopoly ia restraint of interstate or international commerce. The prosecution by the United Stntes of of fenses under the act of 1M-J has been frequently resorted to in the federal courts and notable ef forts in the restraint of interstate commerce, such as the Tran-mis-ouri Frei-!il association and the Joint Traffic association, have been successfully opposed and supp.e-s"d. tate Lec ilBt io;i liiadec-m t. The state legislation to which President Cleve land leokcd for rel ef from the eviis oi trusts has failed to accomplish fuiiy that object. This probably is due to a great extent to the fact that different states take different views as to the proper way lo iis.Tini.uate in-tween evil injurious combinations and t!iose associations which are beneficial and n-'ecssarv to the busi ness prosperity of the country. '!":. vreat di versity of treatment in different states aris ing from this cause, and the intimate rela tions of all parts of the country to each other without regarding state lines in the conduct of busiue-s. have made the enforcement of state laws difficult. It is apparent that uniformity of 'eu-i-lation upon this subject in the several st it 's is much to be desired It i- to ! h ped t hat such uni formity founded in a M-e and ju-t discrimi nation betwtcn what is inji.rn u- and what is iisefui and necessary in bu-ir.e.-s operations r'ny be obtained, and that n.ci.ii- may le found for the coti-rress within the limitations of its constitutional power so l siippl- ment an effect ive code of state legislation as to make a com plete system f 1 iws throuh lit the United Slates adequate to vrrpt 1 a gener.il 1 ervance of the salutary rules to which I "n;:ve referrcL Fh ur the Mra'aiiu (."anal.

The work will t-e prosecuted as expeditiously as possible and a re;snt made at the earliest practicable date. The great im portance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly pressed upon the attention of the congress. In my message of a year ago I ex pressed mv views of the "necc.ss-t of a canal which would link the two great oceans, to which I again invite your consideration The reasons then presented for early act. on are e on stronger now.

I now renew this recommendation, as the im portance of the subject has steadily grown since it was first submitted lo you, and no time should be lost in studying for ourselves the resources cf this great field for American trsde and enter prise. Exhibit at Paris Kxpoition. Preparations for ihe industries, arts, and prod acts of the United States at the world's ex position to be he'd in Paris next vear continue on an elaborate aud comprehensive scale, thanks to the generous appiopnation provided bv con gress and to the Jriendiy Interest the French government has sown in furthering a typical exhibitor American progress. There has been aliof.ed to the United States a considerable addition of space, which, while placing our country in the fir-t rank among exhibitors, does not suffice to meet the increas ingly urgent demands of cur manufacturers. The efforts cf the commissioner general are ably directed toward a strictly representative display of ail that most characteristically marks American achievement in the inventive arts and most adequately shows the excellence of cur natural productions. I'ltiant Relation With Germany. Our relations with Germany continue to be mcst cordial. The increasing intimacy of direct association has teen marked during the year by the granting permission in April for the land ing on our shores of a cable from I5orkum Km den. on the North sea. by way of the Azores, and also by the conclusion on September 2 of a parcels post convention with the German em pire In all that promises clo-vr relations of intercourse ar.d commerce and a better under standing ltween two races having so many traits in common. Germany can be assured cf the most cordial co-operation of this govern ment and people. We may be rivals In many paths, Dut our rivalry shouid be generous and open, ever airnin? toward the attainment of larger results and the mutually beneficial ad vancement of each in the line of its especial adaptability. The Transvaal War. This government has maintained an attitude cf neutrality in the unfortunate contest between Great Britain and the Boer states of Africa We have remained faithful to the precept of avoidir? entangiin? alliances as to affairs net cf our direct concern. Had circumstances sug gested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expression cf the hope cf the American people that war might be averted, good offices would have been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was early instructed to see that ail neutral American interests be respected by the combatants. This ha- been an easy tas.i in view cf the positive declarations on both Brit ish and Boer authorities that the personal and property rights of our citizens should be ob foerved Upon the withdrawal cf the British agent at Pretoria the United States con-ul was author ized, upon the request of the British govern ment ar.d with the assent of the South African r.nd Orange Free State governments, to exer cise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British interests In the discharge of this f unction I am happy to say that abundant opportunity has been afforded to t-how the im partiality of this government toward both the combatants. Wants a Cable to Manila. The Japanese government ha- shown a lively interest in the proposition of the Pacific Cable company to ad 1 to its projected cable lines to Hawaii. Guam and the I'hilipp'r.es a branch connection with the coast of Japan. It would be a gratifying consummation were the utility of the contemplated scheme enhanced by bring ing Japnn and the United States into direct telegraphic reiation Without repeating the observations of my special me--iiget'f February 10. l?&i. concerning the necessity of a cable to Manila. I respectfully invite attention to it. I recommend that In case the congress shouid not take mea.-ures to bring about this result by the direct action ef the government, the postmaster general be authorized tc invite competitive hid j for the establishment cf a cabiei the company making the best responsible bid tc be awarded I the contract, the successful company to give ample bonds to insure the completion cf the work within a reasonable time. The Problem In Cnba. The withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba was effected by the hrst of January, so that the full re-establishment of peace found the relinquished territory held by us in tru.-t for the inhabitants, maintaining, un der the direction of the executive, such govern ment and control therein as should conserve public order, restore the productive conditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability and disorder which prevailed for the greater part of the preceding three decades ar.d build up that tran. ;uil development of the domestic state whereby alone can be realized the high purpose, as proclaimed In the joint resolution adopted by the congress on the lsth of April, ls. by w hich the United St: .es disclaimed any opposition or intention to ex rcise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof, and asserted its determi natitn when that was accompli-hed to leave the government and control of the island to its peo ple. The pledge contained in this resolution is of the highest honorable obligation and must be sjc redly kept. 1 believe that sutstantial progress has been made in this direction. All the administrative rr.ea-urc-s adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for a regenerated existence by enforcing the supremacy cf law and justice; by placing wher ever practicable the machinery of administra tion ia the hands of the inhabitants; bv insti tuting nee-Jed sanitary reforms; by spreading education; by fostering industry and trade, by inculcating public morality and. ia short, bv taking every rational step to aid the Cuban peo- I pie to atta.n to that plane cf self-cor.sc:ous re--srect and self-reliant unity which fits an en lightened community for self-government with in its own sphere, while enabling it to fulfill all outw ard obligations. This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the future grwod gov ernment cf Cuba. We h3ve accepted a tru-t the fulfillment of which calls for the sternest integrity cf purpose and the exerc.se of the highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the a-hes of the past must needs l-e bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if it enduring welfare is to be as-ured. Whether tho-e ties shall be organic or conven tional, the destinies of Cuba are in some right ful form aud manner irrevocably linked with our own. but how or how far is for the future to j do i ermine in the rtpeness of events Whatever j te the outcome, we must see to it that free Cuba j be a reahty. not a nme. a perfect entity, not a ' Lasty experiment tearing w uthia itself the ele- j mens of failure.

Concerning Oar Soldiers and Sailors. Since my last annual message and In obedi ence to the acts of the congress or April 22 and 6, PSVSj the remaining; volunteer :rce enlisted ior the Spanish war. conslslia cf 3-1 .34 regular and 

IIJ.2U2 volunteers, with over 5,0 O volunteer officers, has been discharged from the military service Of the volunteers, &57 tnTlcera and 14. 31 men were serving in the Philippines and I. 650 of the regulars, who were entitled to be mus tered out after the ratification of the treaty of peace They voluntarily remained at the front unlil their plae-s could be filled by new troops. They were returned home ia the order in which they went to Manila, and are now ail of them out of the service and in the ranks of citizen ship I recommend that the cons ress provide a special mc-dal of honor for the volunteers, regulars, sailers, and marines on duty In the Philippines, who voluulanlv rcmaiucd In the service after their terms of enlistment bad ex pired By the act of March 2. conrress has au thority to increase the regular array to a maxi mum not exceeding 6.ui enlisted men and to enlist a forte of iV)ii volunteers, to be recruited from the country at large Hy virtueof this au thority the regular army has been increased to the number of 61,1-i-J enlisted men and 2.24$ offi cers and new volunteer regiments have been or ganized aggregating 3z.0rM enlisted men and 1.524 officer. Two of these volunteer regiments are made up of colored men. with colored line officer-. The new troops to take the place of those r -t arr.ing frc-n the Philippines hive been trar.sts. rt d to Manila to the cumber of 5SI offi cers a i;d 6."t22 enlisted men of the rejrular army and.vi i ffi.cers and IVSM ealisted men of the new volunteer force, while So officers and 14, 119 men of the volunteer force are on the ocean en route to ManiU The force now In Manila consists of K)i officers and '..V regulars and officers and is.ass of the volunteers, making an a.-gre ate of 1. 9 officers nd 45 6 men. When liit- tro. ps now under orders shall reach Manila, ihef '.cin the archipelago will com prise 2.- nl officers and C, -18:' men. The m us tee cut cf tii-irout volunteer army organized fur the Spci i-"a wsr sT'l the crefton of a new army, the tran j.o; igiioa from Man! a to San Fraucu ro r t tin -e etiti' u to dis.hnr.e and the trans portation f the new troops to take their place have teen a work of great magnitude well and ably done, fcr which too much credit cannot be given the war tiepartment During the past year we have reduced onr force In Cuba and Porto Kico In Cuba we now have 3.14 fi'.i ers and lO.Ctj mt: In Porto Rico. 87 officers ;ind 2.S.T.T enlisted men and a battalion of 40O men. composed cf native Porto Rlcans; while stationed throughout the United States are s: 0 r ffi. ers and 17,317 men and In Hawaii, 15 officers and 4--3 enlisted men. The operations of the army are fully present ed in the report of the secretary of war. I can not withhold from officers and men the highest commendation fcr their solr-erly conduct la trying situatiens, their will! sacrifices for their country and the interest and ability with which they performed unusual and difficult du ties In our island possessions. In the organization of the volunteer regiment authorized by the act of March 2. 1SW. it was found that no provision had' been made for chaplains. This omission was doubtless from Inadvertence I recommended the early au thorization for the appointment of one chap lain for each of said regiments. These regi ments are In the Philippines and it is important that Immediate action be taken. Fotal Affair in the Colonic. In restoring peaceful conditions, orderly rule, and civic progress in Cuba. Porto Rico, and, so far as practicable, in the Philippines, the re habilitation of postal service has been an Im portant part of the work- It became necessary to provide mail facilities both for our forces of occupation and for the native population. To meet this requirement ha It- volved a sub stantial reecmstructloti. - TT atrng systems were so fragmentary, defective and Inadequate that a new and comprehensive organization had to be created. American trained officials have been assigned to the directing and executive possessions, while natives have been chiefly employed in making up the body of the force. In working cut this plan the merit rule has been rigorously and faithfully applied. Domestic Pontsl Service. The domestic postal service continues to grow with extraordinary rapidity. The expenditures and the revenues will each exceed i0 i.tXJO.OOO during the current year. Fortunately, since the revival of prosperous times the revenues have grown much faster than the expenditures, and there is every indication that a short period will wutness obliteration of the annual deficit In 1 this connection the report of the postmaster general embodies a statement cf some evils which have grown up outside of the contempla tion cf law ia the treatment of fome classes of mail matter which wrongly exercises the privi lege of pound rate, and shows that if this mat ter had been properly classified and had paid . the rate which it shouid have paid, instead of a rostal deficit the last fiscal year of f8.6H.000 there would have been on one basis a surplus of f 17.627.570. and on another of &5,733.83a. The re form thus suxgested. in the opinion of the postmaster general, would not only put the postal service at once on a self-sustaining basis, but would permit great and valu able improvements, and I commend the sub ject to the consideration of congress. The (Jnestloa of Pensions. On the 30th cf June, 1559. the pension roll of the United States numbered Bil.519. These In clude the pensioners of the army and navy la ail our warv The number added to the rolls during the year was 40.P91. The number dropped by reason of death, remarriage, minora by legal limitations, failure to claim within three years and other causes was 43.1S6. and the number of claims disallowed was 107.917. During the year si. 64 pension certificates were Usued. of which 37.C77 were for new or original pcnsionV The amount disbursed for army and nary pensions during the year was $138,335, c2.fi. which was f 1.651. 4ol.61 less than the sura of the appropria tions. The Grand Army of the Kerublie at ft re cent national encampment held at Philadelphia has brought to my attention and lo that of con gress the wisdom and justice of a modification cf the third section of the act of June 27. 18. which provides pensions for the widows of officers and enlisted men who served 90 days or more during the war of the rebellion and were tor.orablv discharged, provided that such widows are without other means cf support than their daily labor aid were remarried to the soldier, sailor or marine on account cf whose service they claim pension prior to the date of the act. The pr-sent holding of the department Is tbat if the widow's income aside from her daily labor does not exceed in amount what her pension would be, to witi V-6 per annum, she would be decerned to be without other means of support than Ler daily labor, and would be entitled to a pension under this act, while If the widow's In come, independent cf the amount received by her as the resuit of her daily labor exceeds two, she would cot be pensionable under the act I am advised by the commissioner of pensions that the amount of the income allowed before title to pension would be barred, has varied widely under different administrations of the pension office, as well as during difie rent periods of the same administration, and has been the cause of just complaint and criticism. With the approval of the secretary of the Interior, the commissioner of pensions recommends that, ia order to make the practice at all times uniform and to do justice to the dependent widow, the amount of income allowed independent of the proceeds of her daily labor should be not less than 9 -50 per annum, and he urges that congress shall so amend the act as to permit the pension office to grant pensionable status to widows under the text cf the third section of the act of June 27. IrSO. whose income aside from the pro ceeds of daily labor is not in excess of J23J per annum. I believe this to be a simple act of jus tice and I heartily recommend it. Favor a Lsnter Navy. I heartily concur in the recommendations for the increase cf the navy, as sug jested by the secretary. Protecting tb Forests. Protection cf the naliocal forests. Inaugu rated by the department of the Interior In 1SS7. hits been catsed during the past yea and much baa been accomplished in the way of preventing forest tires and the protection of the timber. There are now large tracts covered by forests which will eventually be reserved and st apart for forest uses Until that can be done con gress should increase the appropriations for the work of protecting the forests. Markets for Farm Prodnct. Markets are being sought and opened up for surplus farm and factory products in Europe and in Asia. The outlook for the education of young farmers through agricultural college ex penaicm stations, with opportunities given lo specialize in the department of agriculture, is very promising. The popie of Hawaii, Porto Kico and the Philippine islands have been helped by the est-.n'o-nment of experiment sta tions to a more scientific know ledge of the pro duction of coffee.

Frors the eariie-i tu on nt no opportunity was i.. st of oring the ihv.j i.? f the islands of our ardent de-ire for thir wel fare and of th" intention of this irovernni'-nt to do everything possible u advance their inter ests. In my order of the lPth of May. i;s. tue commander of th military expedition dis patched lo the Philippines was in-tiirrted to declare that wc came not to make war upon the people of the country, "nor uo-ju any part or faction among them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments and in their personal and religi us rights. That there should be u j doubt as to the para mount authority there, oil the 17th of Augu-t. it was directed that 'there mu.-t be no joaut oc cupation with lh" inurgeni-." thai the United Stoles must preserve the i-aceaud protect per sons and property vv ithin th .- territory occupied by their military and naval forces; that ffie in surgents and all others mu-t recogmee the military occupation and authority of the United States. As earlv as Deeeruler 1. before the cos-ion uad in anticipation oi that event, the commander in Manila was urged to re-tore peace and tranquillity and to undertake the establishment of a beneficent government, which shouid afford the fullest security for life and property. On the 2Ist of Decern be after the treaty wa signed. the commander of the forces of occupa tion was instructed "to announce and proclaim In the most public manner that we come, not as invaders and conquerors, but as friends to pro tect the natives in their homes. In their employ ments and in their personal and rel.gious rights:." Tbe same day. while ordering Gen Oti to see that the peace should be preserved in lioiio. he was admonished that. "It is most important that there should be no conflict with the insur gents. On the first day of January. 18 "9. your general orders were reiterated that the kindly j intentions of this government should tx ia every possible way communicated to the Insur gents." On the Cist of January I announced my in tentions of dispatching to Manila a commission composed of thre- gentlemen of the highest character and distinction, thoroughly acquaint ed with the orient, who. in association with Ad miral Dewey and Maj. Gen. Otis, w.-re instruct ed to "faciUtate the mo-t humane anl effective extension of authority throughout the islands 1 and to secure, with the least possibl- delay, the benefits of a wise and generous protection of life and property to the iuhabitunts. " These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gofild 5chur man. president of Cornell University; Hon. Charles Denby. for many years minister to China, and Prof. Dean C Worcester, of the Uni versity of Michigan, who had made a most care ful study of life in the Philippines. While the ' treaty of peace w as under consideration ia the ' senate these committees set out on their mis- sion of good will and liberation. Tbe:r char- ' acter was a sufficient guaranty of the beneficent . purpose with which they went, even if lLay had not borne the positive instructions of thfs gov- : ernment, which made ti.eirerrand pre-eminent- 1 ly one of peace and friend-hip. , But before their arrival at Manila th sinis- tor ambition of a few leaders of the Filipinos had created a situation full of embarrassments . for us and most grievous in its consequences to j themselves. The clear and impartial preiimi- ! nary report of the commissioners, which I trans- mit herewith, gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present insurrectionary move ment that the story need not be repeated. It is ' enough to S3y that the claim of the rebel leader that be was promised independence by any of ficer of the United Stats in return Tor his as- j sis la nee has no foundation ia fact and is c;.t- j porically denied by the very witnesses who were j called to prove it The most the insurge-it lead- er hoped for when he came back to Manila was the liberation of the islands from the Spani-h control, which they had been laboring for years without success to throw ofi. The prompt accomplishment of this work bv : the American army and navy gave fcim other ideas and ambitions, and insidious suggestions from various quarters perverted the rurposcs ' and intentions with which he had taken up . arms. No sooner hod our army captured Ma nila than tbe Filipino forces begun to aesume an attitude of susp.cion and hostility whieh the utmost efforts of our officers and troops were unable to disarm or modify. Their kiirir.e-s and forbearance were ta.;en as a proof of cow ardice. The aggressions of the Filipino con tinually increased until finally, just before the time set for the senate of the United States for a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently prepared in advan.-e. was made all alng the American lines, whieh re-ulted in a terribly de structive arid sanguinary repulse of the Insur gents. Ten days l.-.ter an order of the in-urgent gov ernment was issued to Its adherents who had remained in Manila, cf which Gen. Otis ju-t'y cbsenres that "fcr barbarous intent it is un- , equaled in modern times." It directs tfcat at. eight o'clock on the night of the 4lh of Febru- j ary the territorial militia shall come torether In the streets of Sari Pedro, armed with thir bolos, with guns and ammunition, w here con venient; that Filipino fami ies only shall be re spected: but that all other individual, of what ever race they may be. shall be exterminated without any compassion, after the extermina tion of the army of occupation, and adds: "Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the American and exterminate them, that w may take our revenge for tbe infamies and treach eries which thy have committed u;ca us. ttave no compassion upon theru; attack with vigor." A copy of this fell, by good fortune, into the hands of our officers and thev were able to take j measures to control the ri-in?, which was actu ally attempted on the niijht of February fci, a week later than was originally contem plated. Considerable number of armed insur gents entered the city by waterways ani swamps and in concert with confederates Inside attempted to destroy Manila by fire. They were kept in check daring the night and the next day driven out of the city with heavy loss This was the unhappy condition of affairs which confronted our commissioners on their arrival in Manila- They had come with tbe tope and intention of co-operating with Ad miral Dewey and Maj. Gen Otis In esiauiishins peace and order in the archipelago and the largest mea-ure of self-government compatible with the true welfare of the people. What ther actually found can best be set forth in their own words: "Deplorable as war is. the one in which we are now engaged was unavoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adventurous and en-thu-iastic army. No alternative was left to us, except ignominous retreat. It is not to be conceived or that anv Arneri- j can would have sanctioned the surrender of Minila to the insurgents Our obligations to ether r.auons and to iTie friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and our fiuot demanded that force should be met by force Whatever the future of the Philippines may be. there is no course open lo us now except to prosecute the war un til the insurgents are induced to Submission. The commission is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Span ish squadron by Admiral Dewey when it was possible to withdraw our forces from the is lands, either with honor to ourselves or safety to the inhabitants The course thus clearly indicated has been urfi.inchir.glv pursued The rebellion must be put down Civil government cannot be thor oughly established until ordens restored With a oevoiioii and gai.rntry worthy cl its most brilliant history, the army, ably and loyally as-si-teil by the navy, has earned on this unwel come, bt.t most righteous campaign, with richly des.-rvtd success The nobie self-sacrifice with which our soldiers ;,;.d sailors whose service had expired refused 10 avail theax-selves of their right to return home as long as they were need ed at the front forms one of the brightest pages in our annals. Although their operations have been somewhat interrupted and checked by a rainy season cf unu-ual violence and duration, they have gained ground steadily in every direc tion, and now look forward confidently 10 a speedy completion of their tusk. The unfavorable circumstances connected with an active c impaign have not been permit ted to interfere w itii theequally important work of reconstruction. Again, I invite your atten tion to the report of the commissioners for the interesting aud encouraging details of the work already ace mpli-hed in the establishment of peace and order and the inauguration of self governing municipal life in many portions of the arcnipelaffo. I ct rr muiiicale Ih-e facts to the congress for its information and action. Everything indi cates that with the s; eed suppression of th" Ti.lo rtLoilion, life in the archipelago will so n a.-su.u..- its ord nnry courst- under the pro tection of our sovereignty and the peopie of those favored i-larc'.s wi.l enjoy a prosperity nnd a freedom wiiich they have- never before known Already hu dieds of schools are open and filled with children Religious free dom is sacredly assured and enjoyed The courts are dispen-.ing ju-tice. Business is be n.ni&)7 Uj circo-'atc in Its accustomed channel. Manila, whose inhabitants were fleeing to the country a few months a.o. is now a populous and thriving mart of commerce. The earnest and unremitting endeavors of the commission and tne admiral and major general command ing the department of the Pacific to assure the people of ihe beneficent intentions of this gov ernment, have had their legitimate effect in convincing the great mass of them that peace and safety and prosperity and stable govern ment can only be found in a loyal acceptance of the authority of the United States. The future government of the Philippines rests with the congress of the United States. Few graver responsibilities have ever been confided to us. II we accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions, a great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter or our flag. They are ours by every title or law and equity. They cannot le abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbar-i-uj. We fi:n? them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them unquestioned. Their rich plains and valleys would be the the scene cf endless strife and bloodshed. The advent cf Dewey's fleet in Manila bay instead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress, will have been the begin ning of an era of misery and violence worse than anv which has darkened their unhanDV pa-t The suegestion has been made that we ' could renounce our authority over the islands and give them independence, could retain a pro tectorate over them. This proposition will not be found. I am sure, worthy of your serious at tention. Seen an arrangement would involve at the out-et a cruel breach of faith. It would place the peaceable and majority, who ask noth ing bettT than to accept our auJhority. at the mercy of armed insurgents. It would make us res;onsiMe for the acts of the Insurgent leaders and give us no power to control them. It would charge us wita the task of protecting them against each other, and defending them against any foreign power with which they chosa to quarrel. In short, it would take from the con gress of tbe United States the power of declar ing war and vest that tremendous prerogative in the Tagaio leader of the hour. As long as the insurrection continues the mil itary arm must necessarily be supreme- But there is no reason why steps shouid not be taken from tim to time to inaugurate governments e-sentiaily popular in their form as fast as ter ritory is held or controlled by our troops. To this end I am considering the advisability of the return or the commission, or such or the members thereor as can be secured, to aid the existing; authorities and facilitate thi3 work throughout the islands. I have believed that reconstruction shouid not begin by the estab lishment of one central civil government for ail the islands with its seat at Manila, but rather that the work should be commenced by building up from the bottom, first establishing munici pal governments and then provincial govern- rnents, a central government at last to follow, j Until congress shall have made known the formal expression of its will I shall use the au thority vested in me by the constitution and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of tbe United States in those distant islands and in all other places where our flag rightfully Coats. It does not seem desirable that I should rec ommend at llrs time a specific and final form of government for these islands. When peace shall be restored it will be the duty of cocgress to construct a plan of government which shall e-tabhsh and main tain freedom and order and peace in the Philippines. The insurrection is : cloes and maintains a verv elaborate .still existing and wtien it terminates further in- rf t t dinners iven twice a formation wi.l be re-quired as to the actual con- : t. t. 1 dition of affairs before inaugurating a perma- eek in tbe throneroom of the imperial rent fcheme of civil government.

The truest kindness to them will be a swift and ef fective defeat cf their present leader. The hour cf victory will be an hour of clemency and. reconstruction. No effort will be made to build up the waste places desolated by war and long years of mis-government- We shall not wait for the end of the strife to begin the beneficent work. We shall continue, as wc have begun, to open tha schools and the churches to set the courts in operation, to foster industry and trade and ag riculture and in every way in our power to make these people wnoru Providence has brought within our jurisdiction feel that it Is their liberty and not our power, their welfare and not our gain that we are seeking- to enhance. Our fiag has never waved over any community but in blessing. I believe the Fili pinos will soon recognize the f. vet that it has not lost its gift of benediction In its worldwide journey to their shores. Recommendation for Porto Kico. Tbe system of civil jurisprudence now adopted by the people of Porto Kto is descnioed by competent lawyers w ho are famdiar with It as thoroughly modern and scion t; tic. so far as it re lates to matters cr intern .! business, trade production and social and private rights in gen eral. The cities or the island are governed un der charters which probably require very little or no change. So that with relation to matters of local concern and private right it is nok probable that much ir any legislation is desir able; but with reference to public administra tion and the relations of the islands to the fed eral government there are many matters which are of pressing urgency. It is desirable that the government of 1 be is land under the law of belligerent ritlit. now maintained through the executive department, should be superseded by an administration en tirely civil in its nature. For present purposes I recommend that congress pass a law for the organization cf a temporary government, which shall provide for the appointment by the presi dent, subject to confirmation by the senate, of a governor and such other orficers as the general administration of the island may require, and that for legislative purposes on subjects of a lo cal nature, not partaking of a federal character, a legislative council, composed partly of Porto Kicans and partly of citizens of the United States, shall be nominated and appointed by the president, subject to confirmation by the senate. In the municipalities and other local sub-divisions I recommend that Ihe principle of seir-governmenl be applied at once so as to enable the intelligent citizens tr the island to participate in their own government and to learn by practical experience the duties and re quirements or a self-contained and a sell-governing people. The fundamental requirement for these peo ple, as for all people, is education. The free scboolbouse is the b-sl preceptor for citizen ship In the introduction of modern educa tional methods care, however, must be exer cised that changes be not made loo abruptly and that the history and racial peculiarities of the inhabitants shall be given due weight Sys tems of education in these new possessions founded on common sense methods, adapted to existing conditions and looking to the future movement and industrial advancement of the people, will commend to them in a peculiarly effective mauner the blessings of free govern ment In Conclusion. Presented to this congress are great oppor tunities. With them come great responsibili ties. The power confided to us increases the weight of our obligations te the people, and we must be profoundly sensitive of Ihem as we contemplate the new and crave problems which confront us. Aiming only at the public good, we cannot err A right interpretation of the people's will and of duty cannot fail to insure wise measure- for the welfare of the islands which have come und r the mi thorite cf the United State- and insure to the commoa interest and lasting honor of our country. Never has this nation had more abundant cause than during the pa-t vear for thankful ness to God for manifold his-in's andmercie, fox which we make rev rent in-knowlc-dgaient willia.m Mckinley. A
