Jfmnonti3ttnml F11EM0NT: OHIO, r ZSAAO m. SSBIBK, Editor. . Friday, December 6, 1861. President's Message. fellow-Citizen of th Senott and House I . of Representative: , In the midst of unprecedented political! troubles, we have cause of great gratitude . to Ooo for unusual good health and abund-; act harvests. . You will not bo sunrised to learn, that in tbo peliar exigences of tbo timea our intercourse with foreign nations haa boon attended with profound solicitude, chiefly taming upon our own domestic affairs. THE 

REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE. ' A disloyal portion of the American peo plo have, during the whole year, been en gaged in an attempt to divide and destroy tho Union. A nation which endures fac tious domestic divisions is exposed to dis- Tespcct abroad, and one party or both, i sure, sooner or later, lo invoke foreign inter vention. Nations thus tempted to interfere -are not always able to resist the conscls seeming expediency and ungenerous am bition, although measures adopted under . such Influences seldom fail to bo unfortnn -ate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United Slates who have offered the ruin of our country reward for the aid and comfort which they Tisvo invoked abroad, La.ro received less patronage and encouragement than they prooaoiy expected, it it were Just lo sup pose, as the insurgents have seemed to as sume, that foreign nations in this case, dis regarding all moral, social and treaty ob ligations, would act eolclv and selfishly fo ; the most speedy restoration of commerce, iocluding specially, tbo acquisition of cotton, these nations appear as vet not to have seen their way to their object moro directly cieany inrougn too destruction than tbro tbe preservation of the Union. If we could dBre tobeliove that foreign nations are act- uated by no Higher principle than this I ' quite snro a second argument could Tnado lo show that tbey could reach their aim more readily and easily hy aiding crasu mis reoeuion man Dy giving encour agement to ino principal lover relied on it. The exciting of foreign natioos to bos- lility against us, as already intimated, tlio embarrassment or commerce. These nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic com- mcrce. They can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the ex isting difficulty, aod that one strong nation promises more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than tho same nation broken in hostile -fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foroign States, because whatever might be their wishes, or disposi tions, the integrity of our country and the - stability of our Government mainly de pends not upon them, but upon the loyalty, patriotism, virtue and intelligence of 1 American people. The correspondence self, with the usual rororvatiou, is herewith submitted. I renture to hope it will -pcar that wo have practiced prudence liberality toward foreign powers averting cauws of irrilatiop, and with firmness main taining onr own rights and honor. Since, ' however, it is apparent that here, as io every f other State, foreign dangers noccssarily' domestic difficulties, I recommend -adequate and ample measures be adopted ; for maintaining the public defences on every aide; while under this general recommend ation, provision fordefending our coast readily occures to (he mind. . OUR DEFENCES. I also, in the same connection, ask .attention of Congrea to our great lakes rivers. It is believed that some fortifica tions and dopots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, at well selected points upon these, would bo of great importance to tbe national ienso and preservation. I ask attention tbo views of the Secretary of Var, express ed io his report upon tho same general sub ject. I deem it of importance that the , . .en . . ai regions oi east xenneesoe and Western North Carolina should bo connected Kentucky and other faithful parts of TT ' , ., union ty raiiroaa. t meretore recommend as a military measure, that Congress vido for tho construction of such a road speedily as possible. Kentucky will t doubt co-operate, and through her Legis lature make the most judicious selection r tbe line. The northern treminus musteon noct with sorao existingrailroad, and whether-the route sbnli be from Lexington Nicholasvillo to Cumberland Gap, or from , Lebanon to the Tennessee lino, in tbe of Knoxville, or some still different .line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and the General Government co-operating, , the work can bo eompletcd in a very , time, and when done, it will be not only vast present usefulness, but also an availa- ' ble permanent improvement, worth its , jn au ine luture. . 

FOREIGN TREATIES. Some treaties designed chiefly for lie terests or commerce, and having no grave - political importance, Dave been negotiated. and will be submitted to tbo Senate- their consideration. Although we failed to -induce some of tbe commercial 1 powers to adopts desirable melioration ino rigor or maritime war, we nave rar moved all the obstacles from the way their humane reform, except such as merely of temporary and accidental occur rence. I invite your attention to tbe respondence between her Britanic Majesty's Minister, accredited to this Government, ana me oecreiary or State, relative to detention of tbe British ship Perthshire, June last, by tho United States steamer -' Massachusetts, tot a supposed breach of blockade. As tbis detention was occasion ed by . en obvious misrepresentation of facta, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded 'ktriet right as sanctioned by public law, recommend tbai an' approbation be made . to saiieiy ine reasonable demand or owners of the vessel for her detention. i- ' - " " - THE CHINA CLAIMS. .- I repeat Uie recommendation of my decessor, in bis annual meeaaje to Congreee, jo-December last, io regard to the dispo sition of (be surplus which will probably main alter seitoiytng ibe elaime of Ameri . .... .. .. - . . - can citizen against China, pursuant to wards oi tbe Uommiasioners, under the act of the 8d of March, 1869. If, however, it should not be deemed ftvisable lo carry (hat rcroruinendatioB into effect, I would l suggest that authority b given for infesting th principal, over the surplus referred to, in good securities, vri'h view to the li fction of such other just claims of our cit izens against China a aro not unlikely to arise horeafler in tb eourso of our exteo ive trade with that Empire. By the act of the 6th of August last, Congress authorized tbo President to in struct the commanders of suitable vowels , to dofend themselves against, arjd to cap j ture pirates. This authority has teen ex- ' erciscd In a single instance only. r or ino moro encciual protection or our extensive and valuable commerce in the' Eastern seas, especially, it teems to mo that it would also bo advisable) to authorise the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizoa which pirates may make or the United State vessels, and their cargoes. and the Consular Courts established by law in Eastern Countries to adjudicate thecasos iu the event that this should not bo object ed to by tho local authorities. THE 

INDEPENDENCE OF HAYTI AND LIBERIA. of If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recog nition of the independence and sovereignly of Hayti and Liberia, I am nnable to dis cern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congros, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an ap probation for maintaining a Charge d' Af fairs near each of those- States. It does not admit of doubt that important com mercial advantagea might be secured by favorable treaties with them. THE TREASURY. or am be to by is the it ' r The operations of the Treasury durinir the period which has elapsed since vour adjournment, have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the peo ple has placed at the disposal of the Gov ernment the largo means demanded by tbo public exigences. Much of tbe National Loan has been taken by citizens of tbo in dustrial classes, whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal for their country's deliverenco from its present peril, have in duced tbem to contribute to the support mo Government Ibe wbolo of their limited acquisitions. Tbis fact imposes a peculiar obligation to economy in disbursement and energy in action. Tbo revenue from all sources, including loans for tho financial year ending on the 30tb of June, 1801, was $80,835,000 27, and the expenditures for the same period. including payments on account of the pub lic dobt, were $84,678.034 34: leavincp balance in tbe Treasury on the 1st of Jul of $2,207,065 80 for the firt quarter of the unnnciai vear ending tuo SOtb or Hept., 1801. " ' The receipts from all sources, including tbe balance from July 1st, were $102,632, 509 27, and tho expenses, $98,239,733 09; leaving a balance on 1st Oct, 1801, of $4,- 292,776 18. Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year and for tho finan cial year of 1862, together with his views ot the ways and means for meeting the de mands contemplated by tbem, will be sub mitted to Congress by tho Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expen ses made necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of tbe loyal people,and u oeneve itiai ine same patriotism which bas thus far sustained the Government will continue to it until peaco and union shall again bless tbe land. THE 

ARMY. at tend that line tho aod de : to loy- J with tbe pro i as no of or di rection short of cost in . I respectfully refer to the report of Secretary of War for informatiou respecting the numerical strength of tbe army, and recommendations having in viow an increase of its efficiency, and tbe well being of various Drancnes ot the service entrusted bis caro. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people is equal to the oc casion, aod that the number of troops ten dered greatly exceeds the force which Con gress authorized me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure lo those portions bis report wbicb make allusion to tbe cred itable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army. Tbe recommendation by tho Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uni form basis, is a subject of vilal importance to the future safely of the country, and commended to the serious attention of Con gress. A large addition to the regular army, connection with the defection that has considerably diminished tbe number of officers, give peculiar importance to his rec ommendation for increasing the corps of to the greatest capacity of tbo Military Academy. By mere ominission. I presume. Concress has failed to provide Chaplains for tho Hos pitals occupied by volunteers. This sub ject was brought to my notice, and I indueed to draw up tbo form of a letter, copy of wbicb properly addressed to each the persons and at tbo date respectively nameo, ana stated in a scnudale containing also the form of the letter marked "A," herewith transmitted: These gentlemen understand entered upon tbe duties desiz- naled at the time respectively stated in schedule, and bave labored faithfully there in every since.

I haw so far fore- borne making nominations to till these vacan cies for reasons which I will now state. Two of th outgoing Judges resided within tb Suite now overrun by revolt, so thatifauceeaa. or were appointed in tb same localities tiieY euld ant erv upon their circuits, and many i the moat competent mn there probably would not take their personal hamrd of accepting to serve even here upon the supreme bench. 1 Dave oeen unwilling to tnron- in uie ap pointments northward, thua diaaMins; myawtf rrnra doing justice to the Booth en the return of peace, although I may remark that to trans fer to the North one Which has heretofore been in the Houth, would not, with reference to terri tory and population, be unjust.

UNITED STATES STATUTES. of a v. I respectfully recommend to theconaideratiim of CongrewOlie present condition of thestatnte laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for the many inennven iencca and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the orgnniantion of tho Government Congress ha enacted some 5000 acta joint reso lutions, which fill more tlmn GOO0 closely print ed pngea, and are scattered through many vol unins. jinny of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their proviiona are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persona lo ascertain precisely what the statue law is. It seems to me very important that the statute law should be made as plain and in telligible as possible, and be reduced lo as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of tho leg islature and tbo perspicuity of its language. These well done would, I think, greatly fa cilitate tbe labors of thoso whose duty it to assist in the administration of tho laws, and would be a lasting benefit to tbe people by placing before thorn in a more accessi ble nnd iutelligont form the laws which deeply concern their interests and their du ties. 1 am informed by some whose opin ions I rospect, that all tho acts of Congress now in forco and of a permanent general nature, might be revised and re-written so as to be embraced in one volume, or at least two volumes of ordinary and conveni ent size; and I respectfully recommend to1 Congress to consider the subject, and if my suggestion be approved, to deviso such plnu as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end pro posed. 

NORTHERN CLAIMS IN THE REBEL STATES. the for the lo of is in so its ca dets one of and One of the unfavorable consequences tho present insurrection is the entire sup pression in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justice by tbo officers, and in the forms of existing law. This is the case in wholo or in part in tho insurgent States, and as our armies ad vance upon and take possession of parts mese oiauu, iuo practical evu oecomes more apparent. There are no courts or of fices to whom the citizens of other States may apply for tho enforcement of their law ful claims against citizens of tbe insurgent Stales, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims. Some have esti mated it as bigb as $200,000,000, due large part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens, who are even now making great sacrifices in the discharge of their pat riotic duty to support tho Government. Under these circumstances I bave been ur gently solicited to establish, by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far declined do it, not because I had any doubt that end proposed, the collection of debt, was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling lo go beyond the pressure necessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress, I suppose equal to tho anomalous occasion ; and there fore I refer the whole matter to Congress, with tbe hope that a plan may be devised for tbe administration of justice in all such parti of the insurgent States and territories as may be under control of this Government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order, or by the power of our arms. lhls, however, is not to be a permanent slitulion, but a temporary substitute, and cease as soon a tbe ordinary court can reestablished in peace. 

CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. tho that as and ad to and navy the ser vice. It is important that some more conven ient means should be provided if possible for the adjustment of claims against uovernmeut, especially in view of their creased number by reason of the war. It as much the duty of the Government to ren der prompt justice against itself in favor citizens as it is to administer tbe same tween private individuals. The investiga tion and adjudication of all claims in their nature belong to the Judicial department; besides, it is apparent that the attention Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions. It was intended by the organi zation of the Court of Claims mainly lore move this branch of business from tbe hall of Congress; but while tho Court has prov ed to be an effective and valuable means investigation, it in a great degree fails effect tbe object of it creation for want power to make its judgments final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the dan ger, of th subject, I commend to careful consideration whether this power making judgment nnai may not be proper . . a m . . . - ly giyeu to tbe Court, reserving the right appeal on question or law to tb Supreme Court, with such other provisions a expo. rience may Dave shown W pe pecsary. THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. be lieved, al luded the the of 1 I ask attention to the report of the Master General : tbe followine, belncr summary Utemepl of the condition of Department. Tbe revenue from all source during the fiscal ' year ending 30th 1801, including the annual permanent propriation of avyu.UUO lor th transporta tion of free mail matter was $9,049,296 being a boot 3 per cent, lens tban tbe reve nue of I860. Ine expenditure were $13,. 600,709 II, showing a decrease of Dior than 8 per - aeot. a compared with tboee of the Brevions year, and leaving an r - r !,.. excess of expenditures over the revenue for the last fiscal year of over $4,6(7,402 71. Tbo cross revenue for the rear ending June 80tb, 1802, is estimated at an increase of 4 per cent., on that of 1801, making IS, 683,000; to which should be added the earning of the department for carrying free mail mutter, viz: 1700,000, making $9, 882,000. Tho total expenditures for 1803 are estimated at $12,628,000, leaving nn estimated deficiency of $3,334,000 to bo supplied from tbo treasury, in addition to the permanent appropriation. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. of Virginia was unwise and dangoroud. I j submit for your consideration the expedien (rerouafor jc f rctnming that part of the District The present insurrection shows, 1 think, that tho extension of this District across the Potomac river at the time of establishing the Capital here, was eminently wise, and consequently, that tho relinquishment of that portion of it which lies in the Stale th. restoration of the original bonndary thereof through negotiations with the Slate of Virginia. THE 

INTERIOR. is The report of tho Secretary of ibe Interi or, with tbe accompsnyingdocuments, exhib it tho condition of the several branches of tho public business pertaining to that De partment. 1 he depressing influences of the insurrection bave been especially fell in the operations of tbe Patent and Genera) Land Office. ' Tho cash recipts from tbo sales of public lands during the past year bave ex ceeded the expenses of our land system only abouttwo thousand dollars. Tho sales have been entirely suspended in the Southern States, while tbo interruptions to the busi ness of the Country, and tho diversion of largo numbers of men from labor to military service bave obstructed settlements in ihe new States and Territories of tbe North west. Tbe receipts of the Patent Office have de clined in nine months, about 100,000 doll ars, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make itself sustaining Tbo demand upon Ihe pension umce will be largely increased by tbe insurrection. Numerous applications for pensions based upon the casualties of tho existing war, have already been mado. There is reason to believe that many wbo are now upon the Pension Roll and in receipt of tho bounty of tbe Government aro in the ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and comfort. Tho Secretary of tho Interior has directed the suspension of the paimont of the pension of such persons, upon proof of their disloyalty. 1 recommend that Con gress authorize that officer to cause tho names of such persons to be stricken from tho pension rolls. INDIAN AFFAIRS. of all of Tho relations of tho Government with the Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by tho insurrection, especially in the north ern superintendent, nnd in that of New Mexico. Ibe Indian country south of Kan sas is is possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. Tho agents of tho Unilod Slates, appointed since the 4th of March for this superintendence, have beon unablo to reach their posts, whilo the most of those who were in office before that time have es poused the insurrectionary cause, and assum ed to exercise tho powers or agents by vir tue of commission from tbe insurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have been organ ized as a military forco and are attached lo the army of the insurgents, although tho Government bas no otbcial information up on the subject. Loiters have been written to tho Commissioner of Indian affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving nssuranco of their loyalty to tho United Stales, and ex pressing the wish for tho presenco of the Federal troops to protect them. It is bo- lieved that on the re-possession of tho coun try by the Federal forces, tho Indians will readily ceaso all hostile demonstrations and resume thoir former rotations lo tho Govern ment. AGRICULTURE. to the of Agriculture, confessedly the largest in terest of the nation, has not a department or a bureau, but a clerkship only, assignod to it in the Government. . While it is for tunate that this great interest is so inde pendent in its nature as not to have de manded and extorted more from the Gov ernment, I respectfully ask Congress consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advan tage. Annual reports exhibiting the con dition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would present a fund of in formation of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestions as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might probably be organized. THE 

SLAVE TRADE. in to bo the in is of be The execution of the laws for the sup pression ol the African slave trade lias been confined lo the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that the efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic have recently been attended with unnsual success, five vessels being btted out lor the slave trade have been seized and con demned; two roasters engaged in the trade, and one person equipping the vessels as a slaver has been convicted and subjected to the penalty' of fine and imprisonment, and one captain taking a cargo of Africans on board his vessel has has been convicted of the highest grade of offence under our laws, the pun ishment of which is death. THE TERRITORIES. of to of of of Uie The Territories of Colersdo, Dakotah and Nevada, created by the last Congress; have been organized, and civil administra tion has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially gratifying, when it considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries -when the Federal officer ar rived there. The abundant natural re source of these Territories, with the se curity and protection afforded by organ ized Government, will doubtless invite4to them a - large Immigration when peace shall restore the business of the country to it accustomed channel. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evinced the palriolio spirit of the people' of the territory.' So lar the au thority of tbe United States ha been up held in all th territories, a it i hoped it win t m the luture. 1 commend their Interest and defense to the enlieht ened and generoua care of Congress. THE DISTRICT. ap 40, I recommend lo the favorable consid eration of Congress tb interest of th District of Columbia. Th insurrection has been th cause of much suffering and aorific to th inhabitant, and a they liav no representative in Congress, that body should not overlook their lust claim upon tbe Government. . .1 - i i THE WORLD'S FAIR. At your late session a joint lesolution was adopted authorising 'lis President to tak measures to facilitate a proper repre sentation, of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the industry of all nations, to be hoiden at London in the year 1802. I regret to have been unnble to give personal atten tion to this subject, a subject so interest ing in itself, and so extensively and intri cately connected with the material pros perity of the world. Through the Seo- isiary of Stat and Interior a plan or sys ten) lias been devised and partly matured which will be laid before you. THE 

CONTRABAND QUESTION. Under virtue of the act of Congress, entitled an act lo confiscate property used for. insurrectionary purposes, approved Aug. 16th, legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service or certain other persons have become forfeit, and numbers of the latter thus liberated are already dependent on the United Slates, and must be provided for in some way besides this. It Is not impossible tbat some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own bene6t respectively, and by the operation of wliioh persons of the same class will be thrown upon them tor dispo sal. In suoh case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such per sons from such Slates, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu pro tanto of di rect taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed upon with such States respective ly, that such persons on such acceptances by the General Government, be at once deemed free, and that in any event, steps be taken for colonizing both classes, or the one first mentioned if the other shall not be brought into existence, at some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well lo consider, loo, whether the free colored people already in the United Slates could not, so far as in dividuals desire, be included in suoh col onization, to carry out the plan ol colonizing may involve the acquiring of territory, and also tbe appropriation ot money beyond that to be expended io the Territorial acquisition. Having prac ticed the acquisition of Territory for nearly fifty years, the question of Consti tutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was first questioned by Mr. JeUerson, who, how ever, in the purchase of Lonsiana yield ed his scruples on the plea of great expe diency. It has been said that the only legiti mate object of acquiring lerritoiy is to furnish homes for white men. This measure effects that object, for the emi gration of colored men leaves additional room for while men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room for population. On this whole proposition, including the ap propriation of money with the acquisition often ilory, does not the expediency a mount to absolute necessity that without which the Government cannot be perpet ual. SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION. In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection, 1 have been anxious and careful that the inevit able conflict for tins purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. - I have therefore, io every case, thought it proper to keep the integrity or Uie Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion, I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead putting in force by proclamation, the law of congress enacted at the last session, for closing those ports, also obeying the dic tates of prudence as well as the obliga tions of law. Instead of transcending, I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate prop erty used -for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject should be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserv ed, and hence all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine what radical and extreme measures which may reach the loyal as well as the disloy al, are indispensable. The Inaugural address at the beginning of the administration, and the Message to Congress at the late special eession, were both mainly devoted to the domestic con troversy, out of which the insurrection and consequent war hare sprung. Nothing now occurs to add to, or sub tract from the principles on general pur- boses stated and expressed in those doc uments. . ' A REVIEW up is The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably expired at tbe assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review ol what has occurred since may not unprofitable. What was painfully uncer lain then, is muob belter defined aod more distinct now, and the progress events is plainly in the right direction the insurgent confidently claimed strong support north of Mason and Dix on' line.and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on ihi point. This, howtver, was soon settled definitely and on the right side. South of the line noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland ' was made to seem against the Union. Our soldier were assaulted, bridges were burned and Rail roads torn up within her limits, and were many day at on lima without the ability lo bring a tingle Regiment over her soil to the Capital, Now her bridges and Railroads are repaired and opened the Government. She already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union and none to tha enemy, and her people at regular election bave sustained the Union by a large majority, and a Inrger aggre gate vole than tbey ever before gave any candidate or-any question. Kentitc ay, too, lor sometime in doubt, is now decidedly, and I thiuk unchangeably ran ged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I believe can not again be overrun by the insurgents'. These lb fee States, M&rylaed, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which would promis a tingle soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not lest than 41,000 tbe field for the Union, while of their cit izen not more than third in number are among the insurgent, and they of doubt- lui whereabout aod existence. -After a somewhat bloody ttruggle month winter close on the Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them mas ter of their own country t , An insurgent force of abaxit 1600, for month domina ting the narrow peninsular region consti tuting the counties of Acoomao and Northampton and known as the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together with som contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there bay renewed their allegiance to and ac cepted the protection of the old Dag. -This leaves no armed force north of th Potomac or east of tha Chesapeake. Also. WA havA r,ki.:..J - ...: 'each of the isolated points on tha South ern const of Halteras, Port Roral, Tybee Island, near Savannah; and Ship Island and wo likewise have aoma general ao- counts of popular movement in behalf of th Union in Nortb Carolina and Tennes see. These thing demonstrate thai the cause of the Union is ndvanoiug ateadily southward. l --- GEN. SCOTT. Since your last adjournment, Lieuten ant Gen. Scott has retired from Ihe head of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit; yet on calling to 'mind how faith fully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time' far back in our history, when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforward continual ly, I cannot but think that we are still his debtor. . I submit, therefore, for your consideration what further mark of recog nition is due to him and ourselves as a grateful people. GEN. MCCLELLAN. With the retirement of Gen. Scott came the executive duty of appointing in his place a lieneral-in-Chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that oeither in council nor country was there, to far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General McClellan for the position, and in tins the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of Gen. McClellsn is therefore in a considerable degree the selection of Ihe country as well as of the the Executive, and hence there is better reason lo hope there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thus by fair implication promised, and without hich he cannot with so full efficiency seive the country. It has been said that one bad General is better than two good ones, and the Baying is true, if taken lo mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two supetior ones at variance and cross purposes, and the same is true in all joint operations wherein those en gaged can have none but a common end in view, and, can differ only as lo the choice of means. In a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ships to sink, and vet not unfrequently all go down to gether because too many will diiect, and nc single mind can be allowed to control. It continues lo develops that the insurrec lion is largely it not exclusively a war upon the first principles of a popular gov ernment and the righls of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the gen eral lone of the insurgents. In these documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of publio officers, except the legislative body, advocated with labored arguments to prove that large control of ine government in the people is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the error of the people. In my present position I could scarcely be justified, were 1 to omit raising a warn ing voice against this appearance of re turning despotism. , 

CAPITAL AND LABOR. be of a we to a to In of It is not needed, nor tilting here, (hat general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief attention. -It is the effort to place capital on an equal looting with, if not above, labor, in the construction of gov ernment. It is assumed that labor is avail able only in connection with capital; tha nobody labors unless somebody else, own ing capital, somehow by tha use of it. induces them lo labor. Una assumed, l is next considered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce lliem to work by their own consent, or levy them and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either lured laborers or what we call slaves, and further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a freeman being fixed for 1 1 lo in the condition of a hired laborer Both of these assumptions are false, and all inference from them are groundless, Lsbor is prior to and independent of cap ilal. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much Ihe higher consideration. Capital has its right which areas worthy of protection as any other rights. ' Nor is it denied that there ij, and probtbly always will be a relation between labor and capital producing mu tuai benents. . the error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor, and with their capital hire or buy a few to labor for them. A large majority belong neither class, neither work for others, nor have others working for them. ' In most of the Southern States a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hir ed men., Men with their families, wives, sons and daughter work for themselve on their farms, in their houses, and their shops, taking th who! produol themselves, and asking no favor of cap ital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It i . not forgot ten that a considerable B amber of person mingle their own labor with capital; that it, they labor with their own hand and also bay or hire other to labor for them; but tbi is only a mixed and not a distinot olas. No prinoiple stated is ditlurbed by the existence ol thit mixed elstt.- ,A gain, at ha already beeo said, there not of necessity any sucb thing a the free hired laborer being fixed for that oondition for life.. Many independent men everywhere in these ' States, a few year back in their lives, were hired la borers. The prudent, penniless beggar in the world labor for wag awhile, and save a surplus with which to buy tool or land for himself, then labor . 00 bit own account, at length btrt another ntw beginner t help him. Thit it the just and generous, and prosperous sytiem whioh opsn the way toall, give hope to all and consequent nergy, progress and improvement of ibe condition to all-. No meu living are more worthy lo be (rusted than those who loil up or orr from pover ty, as none are less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honor ally earned. - Let them beware of tar rendering a. political power which 'they already possess, and which if surrender ed will surely be used lo close the door of advancement against tuch as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon tbem, till all of liberty shall be lost. From tha first taking of our national oensus to the last, are 70 yean, and w find our population at the end of the p. riod eight time at great as it wa at the beginning. The increase of those olher things which men deem desirable, hat been even greater. We thus have at one view what the prinoiple applied to tha uovernmeti inrougn tne machinery of the States, and the Union hat produced n a given time, and also what if firmly maintained it promises for the future. There are already among us those who, if the Union is preserved, will live to to it contain 250,000,000. Th ttruggle of to-day it not altogether for to-day, it it for a vatt future also. - With a firm reli ance in f rovidence all th more nrm ana earnest, let ut proceed in the great task hich eventa have devolved upon ut. [Signed] ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, 1861. From Virginia. Wheeling, Doc. 2. Io tb Convention, Mr. Hagar, of Boone county, offered the fol lowing: W hereas, Negro Slavery is tbe origin and foundation of our national troubles, and the cause of the terrible rebellion in our midst, that is seeking to overthrow our Govern ment: and whereas, slavery is incompatible with the word of God, and detrimental to the nterost of a free people, as well as a wrong to the slaves themselves; therefore, Resolved, That tho Convention inquire into tho expedioucy of making the proposed new stale a treo stale, and provisions be nsorted for tho gradual emancipation of all slaves within tbo proposed boundaries of tbe now Stnte, to be submitted to th people of tho samo for thoir approval or re jection. Referred to tbe committee on fundamen tal and general provisions. Mr. Brown, of Kanawha, offered tbo fol lowing; Jiesolved, that the state of Kanawha ought to assume a just and equitable pro portion of the state of Virginia, and in do ing so discriminate between its frietda and foes, by paying firat the bonds held by her own loyal citizens non-resident of the state of Kanawha, and the excess, pro rata share. Mr. Caldwell, of Marshall, gnve notice ho should ask that a provision bo inserted in tho Constitution to the effect that when tbo Constitution is submitted to tbo people tuev shall then determine whether Ihe name shall he Western Virginia or Kannwha. Iho Legislature mot in this city to-day; Lieut. Gov. Palscy presiding in the Senato and Daniel Frost of Jackson, in the Houso. Tho Governor s tnessnge was tent in this evening. Jt is a forcible review of the con dition of Ibis State, and adv tcatcs strong measures ngaicst rebel abettors in our midst. Col. Kramer, of Monongahela, offered a resolution for a stringent confiscation law. The - Kentucky column of tbo National Army is assuming huge proportions. Wo shall not, for prudential reasons, undertako to figure up its strength, but we may say I lint it is a powerful army,composed of good material. Tho work of preparation is being vigorously prosecuted by General Buell, and altogether matters are progressing satisfac torily. The policy of concentrating our for ces, inslend of scaloring them, aa heretofore, is a wiso one. When we meet tbe enemy, it will be with a force equal to the occassion,' in to it French and English Day School. -1TIS3
