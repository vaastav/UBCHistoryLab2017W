Codfish I scarce and high, and Ilahball trust Is suspected. tn some respects this has already been an old-fashioned winter. And so far no one has Invented oft spot for aviators to fall on. The Ktijsllbb. courts hare small use for hypothetical questions or brain storm. One thing Is certain, there Is plenty of room for aviators to make high fly ing records In. The Ideas of the weather clerk art excellent, but the stubborn climate will not adopt them. The nervous wrecks In New port ar. the grocers who cannot collect bills duo from the 400. In football, as In politics you cannot always tell. The same Is true of love and the slock market, bow ever. There are 51 active volcanoes In : Japan, notwithstanding the fact that j no political campaign is going on In ; Japan. Pockets in women's bklrts are com ing back, says an exchange, if ever they can tiud the place where tuey used to be. IMrigible balloons are dirigible only when they move with the wind. They cannot buck the wlud u a real man-bird does. The statement is made by a Swiss doctor that drunkards live lunger tlmu total abstainers. But even if they dj, what's the use? The population of the Philippines has decreased 25 per cent, since we took them over Does race suicide aJ&o follow the flag? That fringe of puppy dogs at a New Tork w-edd:&g has become almost as famous as the monkeys that diue with "the 400" nt Newport. Canada levied no duty on the bal loons that started from St. Louis and went northward across the border. It did not know how to do it. A New York judge has decided that Nevada divorces are no good. Just like a New Yorker discarding things because they're inexpensive! Aeroplanlng to Europe is the latest upon the aviator's schedule. It would be well to put off the attempt till after winter say about fly-time. Every little while somebody wins the world's championship at typewrit ing, but for some reason champion typewriters never get splendid offers to go on the stage. The man who never sees a $100 bill has no reason to worry because of that very dangerous counterfeit which the Washington authorities say is in circulation. According to statistic, there are 10,000.000 telephone stations in the world, and yet somehow or other you can't always get the one you want when you want it Thirty-four aviators have met with 1 fatal accidents during the past y?r. Still, some of them might have ttepped on rusty nails if they had re mained on the ground. Somebody says that the way to olve the transatlantic aviation prob lem Is to manufacture hydrogen gas en route. If he had only said hot air, now. It would be simple. Another aviator has broken the high-flight record for aeroplanes. It happens even more frequently than the launching of the largest ship or the death of the oldest Mason. Horace Fletcher says that If one la to get his money's worth out of glass of milk he should chew It It might be atked what kind of milk Horace la In the habit of eating.
