Murphy to- K K night, "is the statement that Arizona has-a big iebby here in Washington to fight the joint statehood bill. It K I will tell you how big the lobby Is. It consists of just two men, Marcuj Smith and myself. Smith is not K f a plutocrat, 1 wish he were, and I arri paying my own expenses, as I have ever been in the habit of doing. K T. This is the gigantic lobby that ha l.-'n advertised in the local press, a:id If anybody can find any more of it f. it, with search warrants, I womd pay liberally for the discovery." K ? As Mr. Murphy states, there is not any kind of a lobby here. The only men thus far in the city look- K K ing after statehood are Gov. Murphy. Mark Smith and Mr. Fowler, of Phoenix, who arrived last night. t it Arizona is the only territory fighting for statehood that has had such a small delegation looking after its in- K K tercsts. From what can be learned, joint statehood advocates are just beginning to find out that their . K bill will fail in the House. K . -The Senate today passed the Panama canal emergency appropriation bill. This was not attained until it K after the debate which continued the greater part of the day. It t Set speeches were made by Mr. Bacon In advocacy of his amendment requiring estimates for tho canal it K commission salaries; by Mr. Allison, who devoted himself largely to details of the bill; by Mr. Culberson, , t who criticised the purchase of .American ships to carry Panama supplies in the face of announced determl- It It nation to go abroad for vessels under conditions then existing, and by Mr. Newlands, who expressed tho K K opinion that construction of the canal should have been entrusted to the geological survey. it It' A substitute for Mr. Bacon's anlendment, offered by.Mr. Hale, was Excepted. It requires that Congress V. K he supplied wltli regular estimates of-all salaries except those paid to laborers, skilled or unskilled. Oth- K . erwise the bill was passed as reported from committee. During the discussion Mr. Hare made the state- K K ment that Mr. Bishop's duties as "press agent" would be discontinued.

Alfred LytUeton, colonial secretary In Balfour's cabinet, speaking tonight, Eald the Unionists would place their fiscal policy before the country. This is taken to mean that some modifica tion of what is known as the "Chamber lain policy" is intended. Mr. Lyttie- ton also said the Unionists would base their fight against the Liberals on Sir Henry Campbcll-Bannerman's well known hdme rule proclivities. With regard to the fiscal policy, Mr. Little' ton, who may be understood as speak' Ins for the Unionists, said the whole policy of his party would be for the prevention of unfair competition and colonial preference.

St. Petersburg, Dec. 1C Every de velopment goes to show that the gov ernment is resolved to make ati at tempt to repress agitaton now existing throughout Russia and to restore order in the Empire at any cost.

WITH PUFFERS OF HEARTYt MPPORT Y. H. C. A. Outline of Policy Submitted Last Evening i to Gym Members A chairman of the reception com mute, E. P. Van Alstyne last evening received between 75 and 100 members of the BIsbee Gymnasium Club at the Y. M. C. A. They came to hear all about the latter organization and the policy it will follow in Bisbee. At the conclusion of the meeting the concen sus of opinion appeared to be that the Y. M. C. A. proposed some very desir able things, and that It would have the hearty support of those who had during the evening heard the plans or campaign advanced. On the basis that it was an association for tho benefit of one and another, and that the aid of all was needed, many volunteered to take up committee work and enter ac tively into the life of the association. In view of which the outlook is very hopeful and very satisfactory to those of the Y. M, .C. A. who were in charge last nighL The program of the evening opened with a violin solo by P. R. Williams, his accompaniment being furnished by H. C. Williams. Mr. Pollard then call ed the meeting to order with a state ment of its purpose A baritone sole by E. L. Williams followed, and then J. D. McDill, traveling secretary of the Y. M. C. A., addressed the-meeting re garding the general character of Y. M. C. A. work, social, intellectual, physi cal and moral. Edwin Kettle, secreta ry of the Douglas Association, then volunteered to hear and answer all questions that those present might have to propound. A large number of these were satisfactorily disposed of by him. In doing so he stated that there would be but few radical changes In the manner of conduct of the Y. 51. C. A. from that which has prevailed in the gymnasium club. These would be the abolishment, of games on Sun day; the inauguration of Sunday after noon services, and the establishment of a class for the study of Spanish, and a class for the study of first aid to in jured as found most efficient in Red Cross and general hospital and field experience. The gymnasium classes and their conduct will change in no particular from instruction forms followed in the past. o TO
