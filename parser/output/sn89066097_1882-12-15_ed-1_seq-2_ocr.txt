it in WEEKLY GIRAPHIC KiKKSVILLE MI8S0URI dc SV2irX3S Suites FRIDAY DECEMBER 16th 1882 OPPOSED TO NORMALS The editor of the Advocate publish ed at Richmond in Ray county says that Captain Fams member of the legislature from that county will op pose appropriations of the state funds to our Normal Schools He alsofavois the abolition of the ofiics of State School Superintendent Friends of the Normal Schools would do well to bear this in mind and keep an eye on Captain Farris this winter LIGHT LITERATURE A contributor in last issue of the Graphic entered a very earnest plea tor what is known as light literature but there are points on which he failed to touch Admitting all that the writer claims that a boy who has the in grained devilishness in his nature suffi cient to make a thef desperado or rowdy will find means to develope the predominating traits of his character whether he reads a dime novel or a dictionary still there is one feature common to all so called light literature which the writer does not notice It is this A continuous course of novel reading acts on the young mind some what similar to a steady diet of cakes puddings and sweetmeats Mental dyspepsia sets in and a distaste for plain mental food is the result The memory becomes treacherous the mind weakened and the judgement in some cases distorted Excess in any thing is dangerous and unless guided by moderation both as to quantity and quality it is especially strong in this one direction The works of AValter Scott Irving Goldsmith Charles Reade Dickens Eggleston and others of that class can hardly be compared with the blood and thunder Jesse James and Claud Duval style of fiction Indeed we know of one who was cured of a taste lor the blood and thunder trash by one reading of the Waverly novels and has never had patwnce to sit down to that kind of food sin ce The Graphic believes that as inmost other questions truth lies between the two extremes of opinion on this matter DOTV There are two kinds of content Without one or the other any life how ever successful in a pecuniary way will be a failure The kind of content however which is rather to be avoided than desired is that lazy content which satisfied with to day makes no prov sion lor the future It comes properly under the head of shiftlessness and is more common further south where the elements are more kindly and the fiat work or freeze strive or starve is of less force But the content which accepts present conditions cheerfully yet couples ambition and duty there with is a happy faculty to be cultivat ed and cherished by the posessor Speaking of this subject the Fireside Journal says Many people spend their lives in hunting for a place in the world that they were never intended to fill They never settle down to any thing with a contented feeling or feel that what they are doing is by any means work suited to their abilities They have a sunny ideal of a very noble life which they would like to reach in which their power would have free scope where they could make a very bright record but in their present position their life is but a humdrum prosy out line in which they can accomplish nothing worthy or beautiful and there fore it is of little use to try So they go on discontented with their lot and sighing for something else and while they sigh the years glide by and they find at the end they have missed every opportunity of doing anything worthy themselves The truth is ones voca tion is not some far off possibility but the simple round of duties that the passing hour brings No day is com monplace if we only had eves to see its splendor There is no duty that comes to our hand but brings us the possibili ty of kingly service A new scientific work entitled Problem of Human Life is creating quite a stir among people interested in scientific literary and religious topics It seems that the Professors of Prince ton college at the head of which is the venerable and learned Dr McCosh do not take the same view of the work that many others do Prof McCloskie who it is presumed speaks for the facul ty and with the knowledge and appro bation of Dr McCosh says It is be cause we value our precious religion that we notice a book which defends it with the weapons of ignorance and reckless speculation and which is so plausible as to have secured the en dorsement of editors clergymea and teachers of science We understand the book has met with a large sale in Kirksville and is endorsed by some of our leading local scientists Mr H N Jenkins solicitor of pat ents Washington D C officially re

because the times aretso tight the Christmas st Nicholas The great holiday number conies la den with its seasonable freight of mirth and good cheer and chiefest among its special feature is a Christmas story by Louisa ST Alcott entitled Grand- mammas Pearls Other timely features are first the bright colored frontispice by R B Birch a snow scene with children pony and dogs and an unmistakable Christmas flavor TLen there is a graphic ace ount of a long dog sledge journey on Lake Winnipeg capitally illustrated by Farny a Uhrisnias poem by Nora Perry and a clever short story The Cbistmas Faries that is a true story as well Malcolm Douglass con tributes a pathetic little Christmas tale and two pages are given to the words and music of a simple but tuneful Christmas Carol Besides the foregoing there is much that is not a whit less attractive just because it does not happen to be more appropriate to Christmas than to any and every season The beginning of The Story of the Field of th Cloth ot Gold for instance a charming tale weaving in most delightfully the principal incidents of the famous meet ing of the Kings in the GoldVn Valley Mary and her Garden a six page

startling picture by James C Beard Among the good gifts that Decem ber brings us is Demorests Monthly Magazine The Christmas number is replete with suitable articles for the season well written and of a highly interesting character Mrs Alexander the popular English novelist continues her story The Admirals Ward and the shorter stories are well worth read ing All the Christmas articles are usually good including Jennie Junes Christmas Sermon in her Talks with Women The article on Home Art and Home Comfort will give the ladies some good hints and Current Topics are as usual full of interest The Kitchen has not been forgotten and the Fashions are carefully attend ed to Among the poems is A Christ mas Dream by Margaret Sangster beautifully illustrated The art depart ment embraces a charming oil picture of a German lady of the sixteenth cen tury two fine steel engravings and a great variety of other illustrations On the whole the Christmas number of Demorests Monthly Magazine is a decided buccess and cannot fails to give pleasure to its readers Ike Mississippi Some interesting and extraordinary data have just been compiled respect ing the Mississippi It appears that it boasts no fewer than 55 tributary streams with a total length of naviga tion of 16571 miles or about two- thirds of the distance round the world Even this however represents but a small amount ot the navigation which

KASHIMITON LETTER From Oitr Regular Correspondent Washington D C Dec 7 1882 There was a slim atteudance of Representatives at the opening of Con gress on Monday the slightest I have seen in my eight years observation here The laggards are always numer ous at the beginning of a session in years when there is no speakership to settle but what tt was that kept such an unusual number behind this year can hardly be explained unless Speak er Keifers ruling that 11 o clock should be the hour was too much for them People who work from sunrise to sun set will have some difficulty in com prehending the tardiness of a Congress man who finds 11 or even 12 oclock too early for him to be in his seat but there are many of them The greet ings among members of both parties were unusually cordial The cheerful ness of the day appeared to dwell on the democratic side as they discussed what they would do in the next Con gress Every one was curious to note the demeanor of the defeated members who were represented in such large numbers upon the floor Robeson upon whom the eyes of the gallery were often centered was very active going about among his colleague and no one would have inferred from his man ner that he is an intensely disappointed man He did not extend many of his calls to the democratic side probably because of the jokes and chaffing he met with there Much of the talk among members on the republican side was made up of explanations by those who had been defeated for re election of the peculiar cause which led to that result Jay Hubbell was one of the absentees In running over the repub lican side the figures most sought after by the galleries were the diplomatic and courtly On the Senate side of the canitol the change of pleasant greeting compari son of notes about the past falls cam paign and other subjects keDt up a perfect buzz of conversation in the chamber As is usual on the first day ot a session everybody was in good humor The chamber with the hand some new carpet lately laid new chairs and desks freshly varnished wore a bright and cleanly appearance Some of the desks were decorated with floral tributes which added to the pleasant surroundings Senator Voorhees was the lavorite among the senders ot bou quet He had no less than three on his desk Mr Logans desk was al most covered with a bank of flowers having his initials in blue set in a sur rounding of white flowers Senatots Ingalls and Lnpham were also the re cipients of tributes of this kind Don Cameron appears alittle stern just now A prominent newspaper correspondent went to him just after the Senate met on Monday and asked him what he thought of the appointment of his ene my Clayton McMichael as United States Marshall for the District of Col umbia The ex proprietor of Pennsylvania nearly jumped out of his chair as this proved the first intimation he had of of the news He said he had not read the morning paper and could scarcely credit it Mr McMichael he said had never been more than a half-and-half Republican and had always opposed him This was all Mr Cameron would say but he immediately called General Logan aside and began whis pering to him with much earnestness which was interpreted as evidence that Mr McMicheal would not find plain sailing in his path to confirmation As the result ot conversations with several members of Congress of both parties I find that both sides seem moved by a desire to proceed prompt ly with the work in hand attend strict ly to business and make good use of their limited time and talents The Presidents message was received here with varying degrees of criticism and approval but the preponderance of entiment is that while it does not rank as one of the ablest of state papers it was nevertheless constructed with a great deal of shrewdness so as to touch a popular chord upon all the various questions concerning which the people have lately expressed themselves and to steal away from the Democrats a good deal of their loudest thunder There was not the usual experience of printing the message all over the coun try before it was sent to Congress A rumor was current in newspaper Row Saturday night that a copy of the mess age had been procurred and was for sale to correspondents desiring it One or two I believe were taken in by this bogus copy but when President Arthur heard the rumor he sent word hat he wouia nice 10 get a copy mmseii as nis own message was not yet finished and this might save him all furthei trouble Though the Garfield Monument Fair was not financially a success it devel oped a number of amusing incidents One was the development of Congress man Houck of Tennessee and one Wiggins of somewhere as Presidential candidates A gold watch was voted to the most popular candidate ard in spite of the fact that votes were cast for more than twenty five candidates among whom were such well known names as James G Blaine Samuel J Tilden and Dr Mary E Walker the friends of Houck and Wiggins fairly astonished themselves by the strength they were found to possess But Houck carried off the election The President will take a hand in the social festivities this season which will be opened with the New Years reception at the White House Hav ing a good deal of pride about doing such things correctly and brilliantly it is probable that the round of recep tions and dinners will be in keeping with the predictions for an unusally brilliant season List winter while the President was writing his commu nications to Congress and his notes to personal friends on paper deeply bord ered with morning it was proper that a degree of restraint should be observed at the Executive Mansion The season of official mourning was long ago end ed and the occasion for it has faded from the memory of most people here In preparation for the fitting reeeption of guests at the White House the in terior has been improved The scaf folding are still up in the halls and ves tibule but the work of decorators will be completed in a few days Dom Pedro
