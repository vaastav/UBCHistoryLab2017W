Robert F. Booth, who will be a candidate for lieu tenant governor at the next state election, is already trimming his sails for the fight, and he believes, even at this distant date from the primaay election, he has more than an even break to land right side up with care. Rumor has it that May Arkwright Hutton, of Sno kane, has aspirations to be lieutenant governor of the state and will make a fight for the nomination at the next state election. She was the first woman in the state to register to vote, and it is said that she will be warmly supported by the women and that she has many political admirers among the men. E. M. Williams stopped the editor hereof long enough to say, "I have made no announcement as to being a candidate for the council next year, and I am at a loss to know, who could have circulated such a story. lam down and out, and I know when I have enough of a good thing. It takes more than sweeten ed hot air to put me in the race for councilman." The next legislature will be called upon to give King county three new superior court judges, and al ready a number of well known attorneys are aspirants for the appointments. The state of Washington should be divided into judicial districts like the dis tricts for representatives, and that, too, without re gard to county lines, and the judges of each district should hold court in the nearest county seat. Joseph Schlumpf, a Seattle councilman from the Third ward, writes this paper to the effect, he is in no wise connected with any combination, liberal or other wise, and that he will make a campaign for the nom ination on his merit and that it will be a moneyless campaign. No one had ever accused Joe of making other than a moneyless campaign, although if he shouid whisper tha*-. into Maud's ear he would be kick ed a somersault instanter, if not sooner. ASK $200,000 FOREST PROTECTION The committee appointed by Governor Hay on for est fire legislation proposes to ask the coming legisla lature for an appropriation of $200,000 to be used in forest fire prevention. Theie is a strong sentiment throughout the state in favor of giving the commission the amount it asks for. The money will be wisely ex pended and that it will serve a great and good pur pose there is no doubt. The forest fire question in this state is of increasing importance and the able men that the governor has named to look into the matter, believe that $200,000 is none too much, if the state is Is to conduct an intelligent fight in the interest of the forests. The commission is working in harmony with the Whshington Fire Forest Fire Association, which has done so much to educate the people against forest fires and which has at the same time been diligent in fighting the fires. D. P. Simons, of the Forest Fire Association, is looked upon as one of the ablest men in the west in work of this kind and Governor Hay's com mission has been able to gain much valuable informa tion and assistance from him in framing the proposed legislation.—Ex. VENTILATING A COAL MINE Down into the air shaft, every hour of the day and night, an enormous fan in the fan house at the top of the shaft pumped air into the mine, and by a system of doors and stoppings this strong current of air pass ed through every mile of tunneling, never crossing its own path and never stopping, until it again reached the main entry, but this time at the foot of the hoist ing shaft, through which—fouled by the gases, the dust and the impurites of the mine air-it poured out, a cold blast in summer, and in winter a misty tower of misty vapor that ascended far into the structure or" the tipple tower above the shaft mouth. To keep this current of air from taking the path of least resistance and "short circuiting," cutting off whole sections of the mine, there was arranged a system of doors which were opened to allow the trains and mine cars to pass and closed again when they had gone through. As an additional precaution to take care of this life blood cir culation, without which work in the mine would be impossible, inspectors —whose duty it was to measure the strength of the current and to inspect the doors and stoppings to see that no part of the mine escaped the cleansing draft—passed constantly from place to place, testing for the presence of gas with their safety lamps and ever measuring the volume and flow of the air current—Atlantic monthly.

ABOLISH THE COLLECTION PLATE A revolution of church finances is pressaged by the abolition ol the collection plate by all of the Methodist churches of Cook county, Illinois. Methodist churches have never had the pew-renting system, and the col lection plate method of gathering revenue has seemed to be a necessary part of Methodist worship. It is highly significant that it is among churches of this de nomination that the initial step has been taken which may eventually supersede the time honored collection plate by a more business like system. Churches can not too soon correct their lack of financial system, with its dependence upon chance contributions, so cials, bazaaas, etc. In their financial department, churches should be as well organized as any business enterprise. The deficit which most of them are ac customed to face at the end of every year is not cred able to the cause of religion. Sooner or later churches always meet their obligations, but it would be to the advantage of religion if these were so provided for in advance that they could be met without the delay of many months or even years. The Cook County (Illinois) churches plan to make out a budget of all expenses at the beginning of the year, and provide at once for meeting it. The most progressive churches have long been doing this, but without question a big majority never have done so. As the result, most churches are behind in meeting their obligations as a chronic state, until there are gome good people who seem to think it should not be expected otherwise. This gives the church a bad rep utation in paying its bills, wnen it oueht to have the best, and induces various questionable methods of raising funds. Not only so, but it often brings the clergy as a class into ill repute through no fault of their own. To his own great embarrassment, the minister is slow to meet his financial obligaoions, sim ply because the church he serves thinks be may be paid at any time. On all moral questions a clergyman should be an example, and there is some moral significance in the way one pays his bills. Any church claims to be inde pendent, any church that would scorn the mere sug gestion of missionary support, should be compelled to meet the salary of its minister and all other obligations as promptly as any purely business organization would do so. This may not be a spiritual activity, but it has a direct and decided bearing on spiritual influence and success. The world, for example, would not have a very high opinion of a revival of religian in a church that is always behind in its financial obligations.—Les lie's Weekly. PRESIDENT TAFT TO CONGRESS. Be it said to the everlasting credit of President William Howard Taft that he recognizes a sound when he hears it, and he no sooner hears it than he sets up and takes notice. His recent message to Congress was not only full of meat for thought to all manner of man and especially to the general welfare of this re public, but it recommended legislation along the lines, that the people spoke last November. While we are not exactly prepared to say that Pres dent Taft has errred in his administration policy, yet since he has been president, somebody in the service of the government has erred, but he is not so arbitrary as to think that neither he nor his administration is in fallible, and therefore, he no sooner gets an opportun ity to correct the evils, for which a part ot his admin istration had been the victim, than he orders it done. It is not supposed that all the things that the late mesl sage recommended will be passed by the present Con gress, but it can go a long way in that direction, and, if it were wise as to the future good of the Republican party, it would pass every one of them. The Post-In telligencer editorially discussing the message says: "President Taft's message is essentially and strict ly to Congress; it is a statement in detail of the con dition and needs of the departments and bureaus of
