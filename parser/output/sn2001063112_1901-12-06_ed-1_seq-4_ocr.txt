"f tt-S l. IT: ?J '•I 1 ill W I E IT E A PI A FRIDAY, DECEMBER" 6, 1&01. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. ,'. President Roosevelt's message is a novejty io a war. It does wt exoe«ji that of other presidents ip lecglli but it handles th- same subjects in a man ner different. He does not giv« i&e ex tended reference to foreiga matters that have occupied the at-tentxoa of pre vious fir': bid eats, •I. 1 and there are several other characteristics that may be dis covered by a careful reading of the in teresting dojumnt. His first refer ence is *.6 the calamity that, befell this nation in the death of President Will iam McKiniey. and to whom a high tribute is \eo. He urges that action be taken at once to prevent a recur rence of a similar crime. Tb« president ficds nach cause for congratulation over the prosperous conditions of the country and in discuss ing corporations and the manner of dealing with them be says: ''Artificial bodies, such as corpora tions and joint stock other asso ciations. depending upon any statutory lavs-for their existence or privileges, should be subject to prooer govern, mental supervision, and full and ac curate, information as to their opera tionsuhould be made public regularly at reasonable intervals. There fore, in the interest of the vrho'.e people, the nation should, without interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume' power of supervision and regulation over all cor porations doing an interstate business.'" In referring to American labor the president £.aid "the American works with bis head as well as his hands, and was the secret of our success in com petition with She labor of foreign cpun tries. Much good has been and will be accomplished by unions of labor as long as they are managed ••vith forethought and when they do not trespass upon the right^of others iD eDdeavoringto main tain their own.'' Concerning the regulation of rail roads the president offers something of a compromise in this way: ''The railway 13 a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within its jurisdic tion this is so, and should provide a speedy, Inexpensive and elfective rem edy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that bur railways are the articles through which the commercial lifeblood of tfcis nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these ^cpmmercial agencies." The president favors the building of American ships to carry American goods, and believes it to be unwiss for this country to rely on ships of compet ing nations to carry our manufactures. President Roosevelt's reciprocity policy is assumed up in the following terse paragraph: "The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in con nection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the sup port once needed to establish them up on a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition." In reference to the reclaiming of arid lands by irrigation the president says that the western half of the United States would sustain a population geat er t/ian that of our whole coutury today if the waters that now run to wasie were saved and used for that purpose. He favors the} building of irrigation works by the government. Concerning ilie army he bel'eves that the merit system should prevail and the future of the army is rhus summarized: "A general stall' should be erected. As for the present stair and supply de par linen t/S. they should be filled by de tails from the line, the men so detailed returnihg after a while to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed of m«-n who have come to fill the posi tions by the mere fact of seniority. A system should be adopted by which -there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unlit to ren der the best service in ihe next grade. Justice to the veterans of the civil war who are still in the army would seem to require that in the matter of retire ments tljey be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the navy." It is reported through the press that E. S. Johnson, of Armour, has aspira tions to the United States senate and that he will endeavor to securo the support of the democratic party for the realization of his hopes. It is claimed that ho wants to def-at Kittredge and pay off some old scores. We doubt very much the s'atement that Mr. Johnson will be a candidate, for the democracy, !f it has any show at all in tho election of a senator, will hardly permit the plum to go to a man who has hardly served the first season of apprenticeship in the party. it was but a few years ago that Mr. Johnson was an exceedingly strong republican. Ho came to Dhe Mitchell convention 'With a contesiiog delegation, which was tho usual way that Douglas county made its appearance, aivi was defeated in tie convention. Practically £I 4 FOR A

Several changes have recently been made In the teaching fraternity of the county, but as yet there ia not a single third grade certiBcate out. With two high schools and a university in the county, grinding out teachers, we cer tainly have no need for cheap ones who can not pass tba average examination. Some of our teachers have been com pelled to turn their clocks backward nearly one hour and ke«p 6un time owing to exce«iva tardiness. This seems like turning the wheels of pro gram b&ekward, but where Ihe entire neighborhood keeps slow time, it irj un doubtedly the better plan. Teachers' meeting next Saturday. It will convene in the court room. A teacher introduced the superinten dent to her school be other day by saying ''Children, this is Superintend ent Couraey,—the best friend you have" While it is true that the superintendent is working day sod night for what he believes to be the beet interests of every boy akd girl in the county, h'e scarcely believes he is antiiledjtoan'introduction robvi' in aucb extravagant phraseology. Miss Louise Sherman is using ITrank Carpunter's geographical reader for supplementary work. As the library board placed a large number of these books in the county, other teachers will profit by following her example.
