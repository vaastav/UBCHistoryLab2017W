Mr. Ma-iniUB-Ctreenbaoks-Bank ?MM. In hi* annual report the r*e-(Tct_ry of the Treasury recommends the gradual pur cbne and pnyim nt of f-:;i.;.v<I,"ln of what he call* outstanding promissory notes of the United State*, Iii.lng* silver certificates in their room, and gold ccrtlfl*-stcs If need lo*, without contraction of the p re-en l cir? culating volume of thc currency. Tbne " outstanding pnmlssory notes" an wbst other p'rsons call greenbs'k*. These -iffiil'B' ks are, we all know, not Money, hut promisee to pay money. For this reaaon. Mr. Ma rt vi no would hsve Hie snr. plus money In tbe Federal Treasury* usrd in buying them up. Now, lt would puzzle JMr. M.iNMMi to tell win the clrctilitint* notes of the nstinnal bank* should nol b:* retired for tbe same resson?nitnely, he reuse they are not money, but merely promises to pay money. The ?reenbacks are at psr with gold. They may ho oiled a debt snd are a debt, but a* lt ls a debt upon whicb Ibe Oovernment pays no in? terest, tbe country lose* nothing wbst 4'ver by allowing the gneabookfl to continue in ctrculation. It wa* litrdly necesssry, therefore, for the Secretary lo ehsllenge the (.rem backer* to renew the li.-ht agalnsi the nstional banks and in favor ?f a liovernmeut circulation. Instead of being willing to pay tlnse f'promlstiry note*," thcf.rcenhaekers would deprive ni j nstional bank* of tli* privilege of issuing clrculatim* noto. snd cause thc (iavern meot to Is-ue several hundred million* or irreenl-scka In addition to tho*e now in cir? culation. Rut the Secretary of the Trca?ury takes pain* to aay Unit he would hare no con? traction of the volume of tbe currency ami therefore would Issue stirercertiti -ates (and also (-old certiOcates if need be) to perform the office in our national financial t,y?lem now performed by the trea*ury notes or |ree nback*. We arc by na mein* sure that anUBI gohl certificates and silver certificates an* not lo lie the currency of the future, lt is said that the public will not have the silver dollar*, snd that therefore it is unwise to continue their compulsory coln' age. Hut the fact that tbe public take tbe mere repretcntative of the silver dollar ufrsitstbat theory. Besides, there arc altno-t aa many millions of dollars of cold certlfl cute* itt circulation as of silver certilicite*. Tbe reason ls tbe s-me In Iroth cases. Tue gwogftt do not want coined money. They prefer the light paper currency. KiO.iv inir that thc silver and tbr gold are in the Treasury, and that their certificates may l>e redeemed In money at any time, they show their confi? dence in the Government hy Using the ccititicates rather thsn the coin. If the credit of the tin'-e-rniarnt were to beiriu to mu down, the condition of thing* would nt once change, and everybody would pre? ter real uionc)- uold ami silver-and the certificates would refine to remain In circu? lation. They would be rushed into the Treasury. Tbe BOBMO know what real ninney ls when ll come* lo the test. There is (.ne objection at le-ist to the ?(-heme of BBhfltttBtlag metal certificates for national bank note-. We do not nilli lc now to Mr. Mamvimi's scheme. His would retire the greenbacks only. Hut if than are retired, Ibo national bank notes wil' not long Le allowed to remain out. Thc aajeetaoa I* that to oaaaprl the ns'ional banks to Rummier their circulating note* might n -nit in driving llie-e bank* out of the iialional-liaiikin- *y*tt _ altogether. In that 0TCBt- the people Blight not hive a iniii li confidence iu their banks as tbcv ou_lil to have. At any rate, there would, or certainly n>l<lit, ho established as many elilli rent sorts cl bunks as then- arc States in thc Inion.
