Dec. 19.—Nathan Straus, the New York philanthropist, best known, perhaps, for his free, milk booths and pasteurization crusade, is urging the passage by the next legis lature of more stringent legislation In this state; prohibiting the importation of cattle affected with tuberculosis. Also he hopes to prevent the use- of the word "pasteurization" unless It .speaks for the scientific, and not com mercial, method. "Commercial pasteurisation," says Mr. Straus, "is a humbug and fraud. The germs are not killed, but the milk has been treated by a process which merely preserves it and prevents it from souring. "It actually does more harm' than good, for it enables dishonest dealers to keep the milk and market It when it is old and Stale. "It deceives mother*, "ho know thai pasteurised milk is good for their! babies, and do not understand that commercially pasteurized milk Is only preserved milk. "Unfortunately, most of the so called pasteurised milk sold in the city has been only commercially treated, . and the use of the term 'pasteurisa- 1 tion' in connection with it should be forbidden by law." , » »» ——— Chinese Princes Honored PEKING, Dee. 18. — An imperial edict issued today grants special honors 10 j thirty-two prlnoes .m.i officials.

SUNDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 20, L9OB. TWO MEN FIGHT IN AUTO WHICH RUNS INTO CAR ; MACHINE DEMOLISHED BUT COMBATANTS NOT HURT ELECTRIC COACH MUCH BAT. TERED BY COLLISION Chauffeur Attacked by Man Who Was Struck by Motor Truek —Spec. tators Thought Assailant Was Insane I RIGHTING desperately with one who \ seemed to be a mad num. Howard ■ Hamer of 20V North Broadway, I driving one of Newberry'a largo auto trucks, heavily loaded with groceries, at 11 o'clock yesterday morning grap pled and struggled furiously with a man who had climbed on his vehicle and attacked him, while the machine, uncontrolled, ran down Pico street toward a rapidly approaching Inbound car. Passengers on Pico Heights car-No. 4(il were terrified and i.sized as they saw the big machine bounding toward tin- car the two men on the box ap parently oblivious to the approaching catastrophe, struggling and swaying as they struck and tougiit each other. At the corner of Klden .street the mafchine ran against the rails of the car track, the huge truck swerved di rectly toward the street ear. men jumped to safety, women screamed, ! the motorman applied the brakes with full fore.-, but it was too late. There was a grinding crash, a man shot out from the truck as if thrown from B catapult and landed in the Street, twenty feet away. The face of the driver of the machine, who was pin-. toned beneath the steering wheel of his machine and who realized 100 late the gr.nter danger which menaced him, lost the scarlet of anger and took on the ashen pallor of fright. Death Was Near The man in the strict was lying still. The man pinioned beneath the steering wheel his arms raised as if to ward off a blow, sat with his face pressed close against the side of the street car. Had the auto gone a few inches far ther his life would have been crushed j out. In a second all was activity. Men ■ jumped off the car and lifted the man from the street. Others assisted the driver to disentangle himself from the wreckage. It was soon found thut neither was hurt seriously. That, either escaped instant death is considered a j marvel by all who witnessed the near tragedy. Charles MfAleer of 723 Kensington road is the man who had been strug gling with Hamer and who bad been thrown into the .strict by the COncUß sion. He was not insane, as the pas sengers iiad supposed, tun was pitin meling Hamer for a fancied-wrong. According- to witnesses who saw the beginning of the trouble, McAleer was standing by his bicycle in the street. talking to some friends on a sidewalk ' of Pieo street near El den, when Hamer, 'driving tie truck, approached. With out sounding his horn Hamer is charged by McAleer with running Into the latter and severely jolting and throwing him to one side of the. street. .McAleer. Infuriated, ran after the automobile, climbed upon the box and began to pound the driver, who, lie I claims, intended to run him down. ! Hamer, on his part, asserts RtcAleer should not have been standing In the treet. He admits having seen the approaching street* car, but says Ale- Aleer held him BO fast he could not turn the steering wheel. Groceries, vegetables and supplies ware scattered on the street and soon were soaked with oil and gaHOllne from the nearly demolished automobile. No arrests have been made, but dam age suits probably will be instituted. Children and Charity THE HERALD'S plan fur a Christmas celebration for the needy children of Los An geles is to be a success. A dinner second to none as .1 substantial feast will be served at tne^ . M. I.A. on ( 'hristmas day. Preparations have been made to feed 2000 children, and. thanks to the generosity oi Angelenos and others in neighboring cities, there are prospects of even more than the feast of good things —candy, nuts. etc. Have you .shivered these recent cold mornings? There arc those in Los Angeles who have chattered their teeth, resounding to the depths of empty stomachs. Yesierdav The Herald's relict corps found the mother of a 5-days-old baby stagger ing around bare rooms, foodless and fireless. Today, they are comfortable; but there arc many more and it is earnestly desired that money be raised to make some sub stantial gifts. Do not be apathetic; there is language for apathy, but it is preferable to appeal to the finer senses. As we approach Christmas day let us remember him who said- -The poor ye have always with you," and commemorate his birth ]>v helping to keep the promises:' "Ask. and it shall be given unto you; seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." And now. Ihe last word as to the needs of the great Herald fund. There is needed: Money, and workers to jto to many prosperous people who are willing to give. Shoes, clothing, etc. Why not one short hour in the store room? There is happi ness and comfort 'there for hundreds who need. The Herald is making efforts to clothe many before (.hristmas day. that they may be made tit to come. Automobiles are wanted for Christmas day to convey helpless children to the Feast. Waitresses are badly needed—the local Waitresses'union lias made noble response, but many of them must work; JOO are required. Poor children are wanted for the dinner: tell them to go to The Herald's Christmas headquarters and get a dinner and entertainment tag-. If more than 2000 come, they will be cared for; the arrangements are complete. Tell every newsboy, tell children on the street—particularly if they look like they need help —and ask them to tell other children. Physicians arc wanted to assist in case of weakness or sudden illness. The Herald also seeks a choir to sing a Christmas carol at the entertainment. Those who are able to give money or to work are asked to contribute either. if you doubt that such need exists, call at The Herald office end sec the letters that till of woe and want.

SHIPPERS PLAN VIGOROUS FIGHT ON RATE RAISE TO MAKE COMBINED PROTEST AGAINST INCREASE IMPORTERS JOIN IN WAR ON NEW SCHEDULE Arbitrary Change in Freight Costs Results in Powerful Opposition. Many Interests Seriously Affected SAX FRANCISCO, Dee. 19.—Ship pers and importers of California arc- arranging to unite in a state Wide protest against the. Increase In transcontinental tariffs announced by the Souther Pacific and Santa Fe rail roads as effective on the lh'sl day of 1 he coming new year. Opposition on the part of the inter ests most affected will take the form ol a score of mass meetings, held in the leading cities on December 30, when representatives of leading industries will take the initiative and set forth the grievances of the business men against the carriers. An executive committee appointed sc weeks Hgo to deal with the cities-" tion, toojay announced this method of procedure as more desirable than an appeal to the courts, which was !■■ garded as productive of delay, or to tlv interstate commerce commission, which is powerless to take action until such rate changes have taken effect. The attitude of the protestanti was set forth today In a statement by C. H. Bentley, president of the San Pram Isco chamber of commerce and a member of the executive committee, who said: Shippers Not Consulted "We deem It Unjust that the traffic managers should have arranged these rates without consulting the shippers and at a period most inopportune "We have canvassed the railroad situ ation thoroughly, and from the cost of fuel to the statement of earnings there is apparent no valid reason for such an increase of rales at this time." Eastern and western shippers were Strongly represented during the past week at a soVies of conferences wherein traffic: officials of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe system were daily in re ceipt of detailed objections to the pro posed rate Increase. The mass meetings, it is said, are In tended to supplement these hearings when the carriers lake final action. In each of twenty-five shipping cen ters the executive committee has sent an appeal tp a leader who will be given every assistance in the organization Ol it mass meeting. In addition to this, an attempt will be made "to interest the public through the medium of their newspapers which will be supplied with the figures, facts and arguments to the shippers. Issue Circular Appeal The sixteen men comprising the cx c. tithe committee have signed the cir cular appeal 10' these leaders, a major ity of whom are fruit growers, fruit canners and fruit shtppi At the same time the Increased rates have elecited formal protests from pro ducers and shippers of hides and leather, vegetables and other commodi ties. The easthound tariff increases, it is explained, will work a hardship to the shippers and importers of hardware, paints and oils, groceries and many lines handled by cistern Jobbers. It is the expectation of the commit tee that 60,000 persons will participate in the, meeting on "Hate- day," as it is to be known. in the language of the appeal, it is purposed "to impress upon the people of the United Stales, the national r.h ernment and the railroad officials, the necessity for the; withdrawal of the proposed rales." A formal statement of the reasons for its action issued by the executive committee today. Gribling Family Parted Over Half Century Ago United — THE

Rushing up to Mr Donaldson's room the husky underclassmen seized the instructor, 'bore him in triumph to the "gym, where, In the parlance of the boys, he was "given a peach." This was carrying things too far in the eyes of. the instructor, and he de manded an apology that was to have 1 d forthcoming not later than im dav at I O'clock.
