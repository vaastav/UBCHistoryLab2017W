Tho following is the president's annual message as read to congress today: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the peoplo, in tho legislative braneh of their government, rou have assembled at a time when the jrrength and excellence of our free insti tutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest, involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating ag gressiveness so intense as toapproiiehbitter ness and passion, has lccn waged through out our land, and determined by the de cree of free and independent suffrage without disturlianee of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. 'When we consider these inci dents and contemplate the peaceful olxxli enceand nianlv submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opin- j ions, we discover abundant evidence ofaj determination on the part of our country men to abide by every verdict of the popu- I lar will.and to leeontrolled at all times by i an abiding faith in tho agencies estab-1 lished for the direction of the affairs of j their government. Thus our people ex hibit a patriotic disposition, which entitles ; them to demand of those who undertake 1 to make and execute their laws such faith-1 ful and unselfish service in their behalf as ! can only be prompted by a serious appre- i ciation of the trust and' confidence which j the acceptance of public duty invites. In oliedience to a constitutional require- j ment I hereby submit to the congress cer tain information concerning national af-: fairs, with the suggestion of such legisla-1 tion as in my judgment is necessary and , expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tin-some narration I shall omit , many details concerning matters within federal control, which by no means unim portant, are more profitably discussed in I departmental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a j minute recital of many minor incidents , connected with our foreign relations which ' have heretofore found a pliice in executive messages, but are now contained in a re-1 Eort of the secretary of state, which is erewith submitted. I The Turkish Troubles. At the outset of a reference to the more Important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers, it would afford me satisfaction if 1 could assure the congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed ft less hideous and blixxly asrect, and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demand of humane civilization, or as the result of decisive action on the part of the great na tions having the right bv treaty to inter fere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati cism, the shocking features of the situa tion had been mitigated. , Instead. Iw wever, of welcoming a soft ened disposition or protect ive intervention, ' we have Kfu afflicted by continued and rot unfiv.uent reports of the wanton de 6lruct::n of homes and the bloody butch ery o, men, women and children, indo martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. j While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful peencs of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our government at home and our minister at Constanti- nople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of American citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed: but the deep feeling and sym pathy that have been aroused among 'our people ought not to so far blind their rea son and judgment as to lead them to de mand ininofsible things. The outbreaks of blind fury which, lead to murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and without n6tict), and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for prevention or protection, would not only lie resisted by tho Ottoman government, but would lie regarded as an interruption of their plans by the great nations who assert their ex clusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the security of life and property in 3'urkey. Several naval vessels are stationed in tho Mediterranean as a measure of caution and ft) furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims against the Turkish government for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at Ilarpool and Jlarash during uprisings at those places. Thus far the validity 'of these demands has not been admitted, though our minister, prior to such outrages and in anticipation of dan ger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned, and notwith standing that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robK-ry, The facts as they now appear do not per mit us & doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bringabout their prompt settlement. A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports,an order has lately Ixvn obtained from the Turkish government permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that hereafter no obstacles will be inter posed to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in the Turkish dominions. I do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civiliza .rtion that belongs to the close of the nine iteenth century that it seems hardly possi . ble that the earnest demaudo' good people through mt the christian world for its cor rective treatment ' will remain unan flwered. , The War In Cuba, The insurrection in Cuba still continues "with all its perplexities. It is difficult to jperceive that any progress has thus far own made towards the pacification of the island, or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the con siderable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the coun try. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to Strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is" much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without 'practically securing the great object for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independ ent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on, the pretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it bos been practic ally abandonee. Spain docs keep on foot such a government, more or less imier fectly, in the large towns and their im mediate suburbs. But, that exception lieing made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation" of one or the other party, 'it is reported, indeed, on reliable authority, that at the demand of the com-)'iam!i.T-in chief of the insurgent army, 'he (;';.! ive Cuban government has now j n up all attempt to cxerciso its fulle st s. le.ivin'.T the government confessedly ( .. ,'at there is the lest reason for suppos i::' it always to have been in fact) a govt-anient merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their an tagonists in the open or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be l'ked for, and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numliers, disci pline and equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage, but they are allied upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements; that can choose and does choose its own ground: that, from the nature of the country, is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its side. In a country where all that is imlisiensahlc to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily ob tained, esteeially by those born and "bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hard ly a limit to the time during which hos tilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, in all cases of protracted civil strife the passions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on loth sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They are aiso participated in by bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other, as may liest suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder it's wretched inhabitants for their own advan tage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property,' even if it were the policy of lioth parties to prevent it as far as practicable. But while such. seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish government, it has now apparently abandoned it and is act ing upon the same theory as the insurg ents, namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use or advantage to the enemy. It is to the same end that in pursuance of general orders, Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rirral jMipulation required to con centrate itself in tho towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast diminishing, and that unless there is a speedy and radical change in existing condition's, it will soon disapitcar altogether. That value consists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar a capacity already much reduced by the interruptions to tillage, whichjiave taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these interruptions continue dur ing the current year, and practically, ex tend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be re quired to restore the land to" its normal productiveness that it is extremely doubt ful if capital can lie induced to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious atten tion of the government and the people of the United States in any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly senti mental or philanthropic; cli'micter. It lies so near to us as to l.e hardly separate from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is only second to that of the pop.- : ml govern ment of Spain. It is reasomibly estimated that at least 1'iMiii S.,o.oiio.'mj u," $:o,iioii.tioO of American capital ar invt sed in planta tions and in railroad, mininr and other business enrcrpri-cs on the island. 'Ihe volume of Trade between t he United Stale and Cuba, which in ls!) amounted to alrat fi;i.iKtVo. rijso in lv.e to about J !u:i, iO. mi. and in lv.ij. the year before the present insurrection broke out, amounted to nearly j-.;.iM),Oun. Besides this large pecuniaiy stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself in extricably involved in the present contest in other ways lioth vexat ions and costly. y tiny CuLans reside in this country and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by public turnings, bv the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by other means, which tho spirit of our iust itutionsand the tenor of our Laws do not permit to lie made the subject of criminal prosecutions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart. and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection bv this government and not unnaturally regarded with much indignation by the coun try of their origin. The insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by" the widespread sympathy the people of this country al ways and instinctively feel for every strug gle for better and freer government and which, in the case of the more adventur ous and restless elements of our popula tion, leads in only too many instances to active and personal participation in the contest. The result is that this government is constantly called upon to protect Ameri can citizens, to claim damages for injuries to persons and property now estimated at many millions of dollars and to ask ex planations and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for the repres sion of relx'llion sometimes blinds them to the immunities belonging to the unoffend ing citizens of a friendly power. It fol lows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police a long line of sea coast against unlawful ex peditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to pre vent. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property inter ests affected, and considerations of "philan thropy and humanity in general, have led to a vehement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive intervention on the part of tho United States. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should beaeeordedtothe insurgents a proposition no longer weighed because untimely and in practical operation clean ly perilous and injurious to our own inter ests. It has since been and is now some times contended that the independence of the insurgents should 1x5 recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be. no other exists there unless the w'ill of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now also sug gested that the United States should buy the island -a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal It is urged, finally, taut, all other methols fail ing, the existing internecine strife in Cuba should be terminaied by our intervention even at the cost of war between the United States and Spain a war which its advo cates confidently prophesy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dic tates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. Further, though the United States Is not a nation to which peace is a necessity, it is, in truth, the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so much as to five in amity with all the world. Its own ample anil diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for territory, preclude all dreams of conquest and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, .however attractive. That our conduci towards ?pa!n and her dominions has con stituted no exception to this national dim inish ion, is made manifest by the course of our government, not only thus far dur ing the present irsiirrectio'n, but during the ten years that followed the rising a! Yara In 1s. No other great power, it may safely Ixj said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have mani fested the same restraint-und the same pa tient endurance. It may also l e said that this persistent attitude' of the I'nit-d States towards Spain in connection wiih Culm, unquestionably evinces no slight resjxvt ami regard for Spain on the part of the A merican people. They, in tnit h, do not forget her connection with the dis covery of the western hemisphere, nor d i they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish jrople, nor fail to fully recog nize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor. They view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which vase bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt ac cumulated that the costly possession of the gem of the Antilles may still hold iis place in the Swinish crown. And yet neither the government nor tho people in tho United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Culxi or have failed to realize the extent of conceded griev ances which have led to tho psesent revolt from tho authority of Spain grievances recognized by the queen regent and by the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and en lightened of Spanish statesmen without regard to party, and demonstrated bv re forms proposal by the executive and u it proved by the legislative branch of the Spanish government. It is in the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish gov ernment to remedy these grievances, forti fied by indications of influential public opinion in Spain,that this government has hoped to discover the most promising ami effective moans of composing the present strife, with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all reasonable objects of tho insurrection. Home Itule Suggested. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish sub jects, there should 1x3 no just reason why the pacification of the island might not lie effected on that Kisis. Such a result would apjieur to be in tho true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the re sources of the island and making it worth less for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep intact the posscs sionsof Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather than im pugned by the adequate redress of ad mitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its inhabitants within their own control without severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would vet en able them to test their capacity for self government under the most favorable con ditions. It has txrn objected on the one side that Spain should not promise au tonomy until her insurgent subjects lav down their arms; on tho other side, that promised autonomy, however lil eral, is unsullieient, because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled but the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent Culwns before their autonomy is conceded, is not nlt'i gether uptiarcnr. It ignores important features of the situation the stability two years' duration has given to the insurrec tion; the feasibility of its indefinite pro longation in the nature of things and. us shown by past experience, the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is sxHiii!y c. imposed; above all, the rank ulnises v uch ull parties in Spain, all branches of her government, and all ber leading public men concede to exist and profess a desire to remove. Fac ing such circumstances, to withhold the proffer of needed reforms until the partii-s demanding them put themselves at "their mercy by throwing down their arms has theapiH'aranee ' neglecting the gravest of penis and inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms, 'ihe Objection on belnlf of the insurgents that promised reforms cannot lie relied upon must, of ciuv-e, lie con.-idvre.l. though we have no ri-',it ;,, assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for tho relief of CuUi will not lie done according to both the spirit and the letter of t he un dertaking. Nevertheless realizing' that suspicions and pmautions on the jiart of the weaker of the two combatants are alwavs natural and not always unjustifiable 'iwing sin cerely desirous in tho interest of both as well as on its own account that the CuIkui problem should be solved with the least possible delay it was intimated by this government to the government of "Spain some months ago that, if a 'satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered tho Culian insurgents, and would 1x5 accepted by them tqxm a guarantee of its execu tion, the United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no definite 'response to this intimation has yet been received from the Sptinish government, it is lxdieved to be not altogether unwelcome, while ns al ready suggisted, no reason is perceived why it should not be approved bv the in surgent. Neither party can fail to see the importance of early action and Ixith must realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short peri'xl. will add enormously to the time and laW ami expenditure necessary to bring about the industrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for hailing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated, may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and successful issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above outlined, or in any other way consistent with our constitu tion and lawn, will always be at the dis posal of either party. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interest would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference with its control by any other power. It should be added that it can not be reasonably assumed that the hitherto ex pectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due resix-ct to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all its features and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it and its possible results, without considering that by the course of events we may lie drawn into such an un usual and unprecedented condition, as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way, or with our friendly co operation. When the inability of Spain to deal suc cessfully with the insurgents has become manifest, and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all pur poses of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its re-establishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be suiierseded by higher obligation. Which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge.- 8 . Deferring the choice of ways and meth ods until the time for action arrives, we shou.d make them depend upon the previa conditions then existing; and they shonlc not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration is volvmg our honor and interest, or the v ternational duty we owe to Spain. Un' WefacetheconrinmWsnr..wto.1 ..- situation is by other incidents iniporr changed, we should continue in the conduct heretofore ptiT.T.nil, thns In all cir cumstances exhibiting ourob-ediericetothe requirements of public law and our re pird for the duty en join, -d upon us by the position weixr ltpy in the family of nations, a contemplation of emergencies that may arise should lead us to avoid their crea tion either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not ami? to remind the congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests as well as a regard for the interests of other nations and their citizens joined by con siderations of humanity and adesire'to s.-e a rich and fertile country, intimately re lated to us, siivinl from complete devasta tion will constrain our government to such action as will suliscrve the interests thus involved and at the same time prom ise to Culw and its inhabitants an oppor tunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. Venezuela Iloundary lestion. The Venezuela boundary question has censed to lx; a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective governments having agreed uin the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venejmla. submitting the whole controversy to arbi tration. The provisions of the treaty nrj so eminently just and fair, that the assent of Veiie-'"'1a thereto may confidently lie anticipated. Aeoiiaii.msf'ira treaty of general ar bitration for all differences Ix'twecn (ireat Britain and the United States are far ad vanced, and promise to rcn'-h a successful consummation at an early date. The scheme of examining applicants for certain consular positions, to test their competency and fitness, adopted under an executive order issued on the 2oth of Sep temlx r, ltS'.i.", has fully demonstrated the usefulness of this innovation. In connec tion with this plan of examination, pro motion and transfers of deserving incum bents have leen quite extensively made with excellent results. Treasury Department. The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to fiiW.4"i.4w.7tj.

The number of national lxinks organized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed, up to October 31, lH(.i, was 6.051, and of this numlxr 3,679 were at the date hist mentioned in active operation, having authorized capital stock of (050, 014,S!5 held by 2iyS,iw2 shareholders, and circulating notes amounting to t21.412,ri20.

During the vear, however, 30 banks voluntarily abandoned their fran chises under the national law, and in the case of 27 others it was found necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore, as compared with the year preceding, there was a de crease of 38 in the numlxr of active banks. The number qf existing bank organized under state laws is 5,708. Progre Is Coant Defense. The progress in coast defense is alluded to as the one form of mibtary preparation essentially pacific in its nature. Sum maries of the reports of the attorney gen eral and the postmaster general are in cluded. The postofhee deficit due to "car rying at the nominal rate of one cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes in cluding trashy and even harmful litera ture and other matter, which under the loose interpretation of a loose statute, has been gradually given second class rates." is pointed out as an abuse that should Ixs corrected.
