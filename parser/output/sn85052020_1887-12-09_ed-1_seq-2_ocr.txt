fl u h Stanford. Ky December 9, 1887 W. P. WALTON. The President's. Message is a model Mate paper, both in length and excellence of ita subject matter, Believing that the question of a reduction of taxation and the needleeB piling up of millions of aurplus, wrong from the people, is utijust, onerous and oppresiire and leads to numerous echemee for a waste of publio fundi, he devotee his entire attention to the subject and demands in the name of the party for the public good that It fulfill its promises made in the democratic platform for a reduction of unnecessary taxation and a return to democratic simplicity, wherebjr no more tribute is levied by the government than is necessary to administer it properly and economically. The whole document is manly and courageous and the democrat who cannot fully subscribe to its erery suggestion is unworthy of a place in its ranks. If the democratic House will now do its duty, leaving the republican Senate to obstruct if it wishes any reduction of the war tariff, the party will have at least fulfilled its promise to the people and it can go into the fiht next year not' only expect ing, but deserving success. As Henry Watterson says- The outlook is certainly very cheering at this present moment, and for one I thank the President for this thor oughly democratic message, and am proud of him as a democrat. We were down in Liuisville a couple of days this week and got a little of the tail end of the exciting mayoralty race. The fears that a riot would take place were hap pily groundless, there being little or no disturbances. Some scary persons tried to prevail on the governor to order out troops to maintain the peace, but he very wi'ely, like the good democrat that he is, refused to do so, stating that the military should be ever subordinate to the civil authorities and never brought Into play until they have found their power inadequate to the demands. He went to Louisville, however, determined if there was absolute need for it and the request came from the proper authority, to use prompt measures. We met him while there and his remarks on this and other questions increased our admiration for the soldier of two wars. Sometime ago a United States judge ordered the Attorney General of Virginia and several Commonwealth's Attorneys to j -ill for contempt. They went to jail and under habeas corpus proceeding? thec4se was tak en before the Supreme Cjurt. It was ably argued pro and con. Kscoe Cnkling and other distinguished lawyers appearing for the Virginia officers. Monday Jud;e Mat tbewa delivered the opinion of the Court re leasing the officers and declaring that their incarceration was without authority o' law The contempt consisted in the officers bringing suit under the S:ate law for taxes where the tender was much in hie coupons, against an order of Judge Bond. The Supreme Court has settled the pro bibition question in the bffirmative. In the three case appealed from Kansas it decided this week that the State under its po lice power' had the right to suppress the liquor traffic, and that in the State proceedings no right or privilege grtnted to the distillers and liq tor de tiers had Haen denied or abridged; aNo that the S'.a'e had the right to suppress the tratfi: with out paylnc dtniitjei or to liquor dealers Tne Kertucky Court of Appeals can now decide the case itppealed from Lincoln county and Judge Mirror can then settle the contest. A ckank in the gallery of the House at Washington Monday varied the monotony of tbe routine proceedings by bursting forth in sten orisn voice, "Let us sing the and proceeding to give the verse "Praise God from Whom all blessings fl iw," in loud if not musical numbers. A policeman bmtlcd him out as aosn a' possible, when lie explained as there was o chaplain present some tort of religious ceremony ouht to start Congress on its duties. Tbe fleet of the hymn was amus ing and rediculous The dirty fight in Louisville is oyer and Charles D. Jacob goes in for a third term for mayor with more voiet than his two opponen a combined. He has demonstrated full; his strength in the city and while he may have put up tbe "boodle," as charged, most liberally, the result is too t') admit of a doubt as to his pip'ilariir with the people. Now let the ciiy papers give us a rest and something better to read than bitter invective and dirty mudsling- mg. To the surprise of the dein the republican Senate made no objection to tbe swearing in of the new Senators from Indiana and New Jersey and agreed to settle the Faulkner-Lucas contest from Weit Virginia in committee. After all the talk about refusing seats to Turpie and Hearst, this sorter took the breath away from the democrats, who are auspicioui of the "Greeks bearing gifts." The last two decisions of the Supreme Court affirm the doctrine of State rights even mora strongly than Jefl Davis ever did. Tbe Supreme Court is a republican concern, you will als'i recollect. We nrr in receipt of an invitation to the marriage of Mr. W O. Ormtreet, of the Hart County .Vena, to Mies Clara Card, which is to occur at Cve City, JDectmberUl. Jdst after we had gone to press last is sue a dispatch was received stating that the President's message would not ba delivered to Congress till next day. We had made all arrangements to print it and send it out Tuesday, as it is customary for the message to be sent to Congress on the first day of ita se4ion, but the failure knocked us out of our plans and we waited to send it with this impression. It can be found on our fourth ptge and when you have read it you will agree with all good men in the country that it is a most admirable document. Conhressman Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who swore in Ctrlisle Moadav, is 74 and has been a member of the House for 26 years The duty of swearing in the devolves by usage on the oldest member. The republican papers are thrown into conniptions by the President's courageous message and claim that he is an out and out free trader. Rsad the document and see if such a construction can be placed on it. NEWSr

When killings take place like the recent ones on Brush creek, the whole county in which they occur is, br those living out side its limits, or at a distance, who are unacquainted with the facts, thought lo be entirely lawless, but such is not the fact in this instance at least. The trouble is confined to a locality or neighborhood of but a few miles tquare and is an old feud of long standing. No further arresls have been made of the parties concerned in the Brush creek killings. Saeriff White was down in that region Monday and talked with several of tbe parties concerned, but says be had no writs for their arrest. Laswell, the slayer of Adams sent word to Judge Colytr that he would come in and surrender, but up to this writing. (Wednesday night), has not done so.

They all Like Cleveland's Message The message is an able, conservative and statesmanlike document, which, unlike many other messages, will be read by the people.-N. Y. World. The admirable message of the President has given to the democratic party what it has long lacked an issue and n leader. The issue is tax re'orin. Tbe leader is the Y. Herald. As a public document, addressed by th Cnief Executive to Congress, and through Congress to the people, it is a model and opens to the democracy new opportunists of usefulness, It will bring to the Presi dent and to tbe party renewed confidence and support. The President is eirnest and he is aggressive, mid so clear, aud at the same time so temperate, is he that the great conservative masses will see that under such leadership tbe democratic party is fully couipent to deal with this perplexing problem, Courier-Journal. Mr. Springer thinks it one of the most perfect messages ever sent tc Congress Representatives Breckinridge, Ciruth, Mc-Creary, Taulbee, Stone, LifJoou aud Mont gomery were each loud in praise of tbe message. In their opinion it is the greatest Slate paper ever sent out from the White House. It dwelt upon the tariff question as thev desired and they indorse it in every particular anu detail. They are enthusiastic in its praise, as was also about every democrat on tbe tloor not committed j to the Kindall idea, 

GARRARD COUNTY DEPARTMENT, Lancaster. It would not be so dry in Lancaster if il wasn't ao wet. Capt. M. Salter is on the aick list. Deputy Collector Miller went to Richmond yesterday. License has been given to W. T, Poin ter to marry Mrs SallleGailney. The groom is a widower. The President's message pleases everybody. Jake Joseph says you can't count his majority next time. I am reliably informed that John Brewer's fox hound will not join in the chase, preferring the camp fire which the hunters build. The Hoke men in Lancaster are blue, the Avery men "ain'tsayin' nothin,' " while the Jacob men are jubilant. "This is the way tbe world goes." The happiest man in town is "Major1" Kinnaird. On Tuesday night hit wife made him a Christmas present of a fine girl baby. Her's lo you "Major I" Tne following message was sent Wed nesday to a Lancaster gentleman, who is absent in Covington: "J A. B., Covington, Ah therel Stay ther.l Dry br! F." There will be a musicale given at Gar rard Female College about Dec. 231 by the pupils and I am assured that It will repay those who attend, and well at that. 11 them have a good crowd. On Wedtiesdav at the residence of J A. Dotj, Eq., M si Jennie Lsavell was married to Mr. R O. Armstrong, of Har rodeburg. Ceremony by Rev E. E Ervin. Attendauts Miss Jennie Armstrong and John L. Doty. Miss Emma Leavell atd W. A. Sharp. Immediately after the ceremony the happy couple left for tbe home of the groom in Harrodiburg. It is a that Garrard county boys allow our Klrls to be taken away in this manner. Tbe irrepressible "Tub" Smith, the popular woodenware salesman, was in town ou Wednesdey. Noticing a new scale, in one ol our grocery houses here he said, in answer to a question from the proprietor as to bis opinion of it, "Well, that is a (air scale, but is nothing to compare with 'Tripod' scale. There is a scale, as is a scale. A lady comes into the store, with a basket of eirgs and bucket of butler, she wants lo exchange for lea. You jutt set tbe two on that scale and the beams i rid i cate the amount of lea she is entitled to for her produce. Whv, sir, you can drive a lot of cattle "onto" their slock scale, and tbe beams give out the return in dollars and cents. No matter what price per pound they were sold for." At this moment Charley Wasson, a brother liar fainted and the story came lo an end. This is a fact. The readers of the Intniiok Journal will remember that last October a year ago. there was an election held in Lancaster to take the sense of the voters as lo whether liquor should be sold in Lancaster precinct This election was won by the people. At the expiration of his license J. W. Miller, who was running a saloon wt.eo the act was voted, closed his place of business, and made application to the County Court for new license. 1 his was refused and the mailer went to the Circuit Court At the last January term of said Court, Judge Morrow presiding, decided that tbe Local Option law was null, because of the fact that in the order for the calling of tbe election, there was no penalty attached to the violation of the act. Thereupon the County Judge issued Mr. Miller license, and the City Council followed suit. Upon a rehearing of the case, in which the temperance people raised the question of juris diction, Judge Morrow decided that he had no jurisdiction. The County Judge at once revoked the license and the Trustees, claiming authority from the city charter, did likewise. Mr. Miller believing bis good, both the Slate and the city having received the money for them, con tinned to sell. Prttty soon a batch of war ranis were is'tied against him, and after much wrangling, it was finally agreed that the cases should be tried by Col. R P. Ja cobs, of Dinyille. Accordingly on Tues day the cases were submitted lo Col Jacobs at the Court liou here. After argument on tbe side of Mr Miller by Judge SaulUy and on the side of the temperance pople by Messrs. Landram, Noel and Judge Ows ley, his honor in a very able opinion, decid ed that the decision of Judge Morrow, say ing be had no jurisciction in the matter, rendered the county license of Mr. Miller invalid, and further that the Trustees had a right under town charter to revoke a town at any time. As soon as the result wai announced Mr. Miller closed his siloon and Lancaster is again dry. It i not likely that an appeal will be taken This will probably be an end to tbe matter. Resolutions of Respect. At a meeting of the friends of Rev. John R Jame', in the Southern Baptist Theolog ical Seminary, the following resolutions were adopted Wiieiikas, In l lis providence of an all-wise God, our beloved brother and friend, Rsv. John R.
