To the Editor of The Star: I notice In one of your recent issues that the Staunton Rotary Club Is on the waipath against glaring auto head lights. Accidents are not primarily caused by glaring headlights. It makes but little difference to one accustomed to drive at night whether a 21-candle power headlight, which has been adopted in many states and more re cently in Massachusetts, is used or a 25 or even 32-candlepower. The main thing is to see that lamps are not elevated unnecessarily. The driver, in any event, watcheB only the extreme right edge of the road, and keeps as close to that as safety permits, and doing -this will avoid accidents as far as two cars passing are concerned. But the pe destrian, who hasn't a chip on his shoulder and really cares to live should always walk on the left side of the road, and not, as ninety-nine out of a hundred now do, on the right hand side. By doing this he Is en abled to take care of himself and to know unfailingly that a car Is ap proaching, and he will not be blinded by an approaching car and thus fail to notice the car which so often comes up in the rear and strikes him when he has stepped the wrong way in confusion. Walking on the left side, with the car coming behind him on the right, he is perfectly safe so far as that car Is concerned, and if the driver of the car coming toward him has not seen him In time and is unable to turn in to avoid him he nearly always has the opportunity of stepping oft the road to avoid accident. A. C. MOSES. DIES AT AGE OF 90. Benjamin Franklin Duvall, owner of Trump Hill, and rich in his remi niscences of ante-bellum days, died Monday at his home near Marlbor ough, Md. He was ninety years of age. Mr. Duvall was interested In hunt ing, and was frequently host at fox hunts held in his neighborhood. He could vividly picture the days of the slave markets and the events that oc curred long before the civil war. He was well known in the community. Funeral services were held yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, at St. Thomas' i Church, Croome, MO. 1 BILL EMBODIES TARIFF CHANGES AS SUGGESTED Smoot Amendments Offered Carry Out proposals President Made in His Message. Suggestions made by President Harding in his message to Congress i for changes In the proposed new tariff law, which would provide for greater flexibility, were included in amendments to the law offered Tuesday in the Senate by Senator Smoot of Utah. One of Senator Smoot's amendments would empower the President to pro- I claim American valuation as the basis for assessing duties at such time and on such articles as deemed necessary. The other iimendment offered by the Utah senator gives the President power to Increase or decrease iritport rates as conditions, after a survey ordered by the executive, show to be warranted. Both propositions, Mr. Smoot said, would be called before the Senate immediately the tariff bill is reported to that body. Wide latitude is given the Presi dent in the discretionary reduction or increasing- of duties, the amendment specifying that such changes are authorized up to 50 per cent of the rate fixed in the law. Changes deter mined upon by the President would become effective thirty days after be ing proclaimed by the President, the bill provides. THE
