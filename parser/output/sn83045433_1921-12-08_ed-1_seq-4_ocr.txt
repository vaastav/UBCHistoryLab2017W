BENJAMIN & KENTNOR COMPANY, National Advertising Representatives Entered as Second-Class Matter, Postoffiee, Washington, D. C. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8. 1931. The Message. PRESIDENT HARDING'S message delivered in person on Tuesday, is his ' first to a regular session and therefore of broad and inclusive scope as to national affairs. To the man of the street free from partisan prejudices and so the best judge, it. will leave a very satis factory and gratifying impression. It reads as the judgment of a man blessed with abundant common sense, peculiarly tolerant, free from any marked prejudices and with that impartial balance which is natural to the thorough American who is of all classes and no class. It is a very quotable document, its discus sions of each question being plainly stated, making clear cut issues and quite unmistakable statements. But it is not contentious, censorious or critical; quite the contrary, it is eminently fair in its tone and method, giving due credit to others; seeking party harmony and team work. Because of the armament conference and the many reports as to new foreign relationships which may come from it. the parts of the message relating to foreign affairs are apt to be most closely analyzed. Cer tainly they are not narrow, and they indicate a growth in grasp and a broadening of view, which may be a quite inevitable consequence of responsi bility and having to look from the inside, out, as well as from the outside, in. Such statements as the following, have no little significance: Our tasks would be less difficult if we had only ourselves to consider, but so much of the world was involved, the disordered conditions are so well-nigh universal, even among nations not engaged in actual warfare, that no permanent readjustments can be ef fected without consideration of our inescapable relationship to world affairs in finance and trade. Indeed we should be unworthy of our best traditions if we were unmindful of social, moral and political conditions which are not of direct concern to us. but which do appeal to the human sympathies and the very be- 1 coming interest of a people blest with our " national good fortune. ? ? ? They (the powers immediately concerned) must themselves turn to the heroic remedies ior the menacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly because there is compensation in the consciousness of assisting, selfishly because the commerce and international exchanges in trade, which marked our high tide of fortunate advancement, are possible only when the nations of all continents are restored to stable order and normal re lationship. There will be great interest in that portion of the message referring to merchant marine and promising a distinctly stated program for its pr* motion in the near future. This can hardly be other than some form of a subsidy so that it would seem the war time white elephant, may be about to force this policy for its support which had been persistently rejected as a means for its gradual development and logical growth. As tHe President says, denouncing all commercial treaties to put into effect discriminating tariffs, is im- , possible, while some form of subsidy is used by I every other country that pretends to be a sea j carrier. Of kindred interest and good sense is the plea for a flexible tariff act. Protective tariffs we must have. They were never so essential to the maintenance of American wage scales, Ameri can plane of living and the home markets, as against a flooding by goods based in price on almost valueless money and extreme exchange fluctuations. The President recommends that au thority be given him to permit the Tariff Com mission to revise specific schedules from time to time and adjust them to changed monetary, economic or labor conditions, which will be in a constant state of flux in foreign countries. It would seem that this would have to be granted. It is self-evident that any tariff schedule, based on present conditions may six months, or less, or more, from now either act as an import pro hibition. or to the contrary, flood this market. The antics of the German market are enough to point the moral. Of course, action would not be by the commission, but by the Presi dent on the commission's findings. The portion relating to agriculture will be generally commended. No one can well deny the economic soundness of the proposition that the farmer should have a larger share of the price of his products to the consumer. The spread between the farm price and retail price is entirely too wide, and unnecessarily so. Mr. Gompers has already jumped with hob-nailed boots on the section relating to the relations of employers and employes. "Capital and labor" has become a misnomer for economic and social relations in this country, since, as the President points out, so many employes are capitalists and so many capitalists arc employes. The line' between capital and labor has become indistinguishable for most of its distance. It is probable, too, that Mr. Gompers will find he was more scared than hurt when he reads that part of the message more carefully. The Danbury hat case is now to be followed by a suit of the clothing workers against their em ployers for violation of a labor contract. Rights and liabilities are being fixed as between employer and employe and the public is getting mighty tick of being the perpetual goat. The President is everlastingly right that "in an industrial society such a* ours the strike, the lockout and the boycott are as much out ot place and as dis astrous in their results as in war or armed revo lution in the domain of politics." Either Mr. Gompers and his 'fellows must find a way to end strikes, or a way will be found for them. Reclamation of public lands, both arid and swamp, is broadly recommended. Here is the place and way to regulate and end unemploy ment. Here are projects widely scattered, capable of exact planning and organization, where opera tion could be undertaken on nearly any scale at any time, and almost abandoned without material hurt when the emergency ended. It is also grati fying, especially so to The Herald, that the Presi dent recognized the auiful plight of Russia for a specific gift of food materials. America cannot afford to harden its heart to suffering bccause of political differences. As a whole the message has been well received. It fits present day public sentiment and responds to the popular desires. It is a notable event for a Philadelphia orchestra leader to produce fourth dimension music in Washington. He knew where to come to obtain an understanding audience. Delayed Wixlom. THE apt though inelegant proverb concerning the disparity of "foresight" and "hindsight" is highly applicable to about all the doings of the human race, but particularly to international affairs. How clftarly we all now descry the inevita bility of the world war, how certainly its train of economic evils! But we saw far too late to modify conditions which produced the unparalleled struggle and again we behold too tardily the bale ful effects of its prosecution to do more, immedi ately, than apply palliatives. After all, the man in the street can't be blamed for not rising with the strident voice of prophecy when this tough old world may seem to be galumping ,along to another fall. It's the scribes who are to blame, that is, if one is per mitted to gauge their deductive powers as to future events from their writings on world politics, and the like, of the recent past. Specifically, we refer to 'the vast mass of printed matter offered daily, weekly and monthly, as ?.o the woeful condition of our friends, the Germans, and the dire effects of their present dilemma on the whole civilized world. When, not so very many months ago, the reparations commission of the league of nations announced Its findings, loud hurrahs were heard on every hand, in type and out. The well-known "staggering total" of gold marks which the van quished foe was called upon to toss into the coffers of the allied nations was a string of figures over which the expert economists gloated for column after column. So far as our reading disclosed, there was not one protest registered against a finding which the consensus of informed opinion today condemns. The allied troops occupied three important Rhine cities to supervise customs and compel the payment of an indemnity installment, and again there were cries of approbation. It was only after the peaceful but determined invasion that the ex perts discovered an industrial paralysis was liable to be the result. So things moved on to the apparent definite schism between French and British policies, to the accompaniment of unemployment explosions from the latter and the jingling of sabers and peal of trumpets from the former. Now, with Germany all laid out, hardly knowing whether she is a corpse or a subject for further major operations, to hear her statesmen and bankers tell it, the experts ' have about decided that things have indeed been handled wrong. They advance thesis after thesis of length and profundity tracing with unimpeachable clarity the mistakes that have been made in the handling of the Gerhian situation. It makes great reading and gives one a sense of being uncommonly erudite when one has assimilated the most recent crop of findings. But the troublous thought continues to recur: "Why didn't they think.of all these things before they turned to direful consequences?" Er rant ministries might have been turned from their courses, economic losses of millions averted, the resuscitative methods about to be employed ren dered unnecessary. The plain truth is, that the proverb previ ously noted is most everlasting true, in the cases of both layman and expert. Both stand astounded at developments of which the portent was written on the skies. The difference is that the experts are much more adept at dissembling their surprise. Washington presents the anomaly of pro viding excellent office buildings without hav ing sufficient schools in which to train citi zens to manage the offices efficiently. Germany as a Buyer.
