C., Dec. 4.—Not for many years have the members of the house listened with such rapt atten tion to the annual message of the president of the United States, as they did yesterday to the reading of the first message of Piesident Roosevelt. Every word was followed intently, from the announcement of "the tragic death of President McKinley, in the opening sentence, to the expression of the clos ing wish that our relations with the world would continue peaceful. The reading occupied two hours, but not over a dozen members left their seats until it was concluded. Severdl times there was applause, and at the conclu sion there was an enthusiastic demon stration on the Republican si Je. On motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, that portion of the message relating to the deat.h of the late president was refer red to a committee consisting of one member from each state, to join a sim lar committee of the senate, to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for con gress to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of tlie late president. The speaker appointed a committee, headed by Mr. Grosvenor, and then, as a further mark of respect, the house adjourned. In the Senate. The senate listened to the first mes sage of President Roosevelt yesterday, and adopted a resolution directing the appointment of a committee, to co-op erate with a like committee from the house, to consider by what token of re spect and affection congress might ex press the sorrow of the nation upon the tragic death of the late President Mc Kinley. The message was delivered soon after the senate met. The read ing occupied nearly two and a half hours, and was,listened to with marked respect by the senators. The first por tion, dealing witfc the Buffalo tragedy, excited the most profound interest in the senate. At the "conclusion of the reading of the message Mr. Poraker, senior senator from Ohio, presented the McKinley resolution, and, as a further mark of respect, the senate adjourned. III the Senate, Washington, Dec. 5.—Practically the entire time of the senate yesterday was devoted to the introduction of bills and resolutions. Two of these measures, relating to the suppression of anarchy and tho dealing with anarchists, were allowed to lie on the table so that their authors, Mr. McComas of Maryland anil, Mr. Vest of Missouri, may bring tlum to the early attention of the sen ate. The Isthmian canal report was transmitted to the senate by the pres ident and several bills providing for the construction of the waterway,' one of them by Mr. Morgan of Alabama, who has led the movement for the ca nal in the past, were presented. Washington, Dec. 6. Senator Mc Comas of Maryland made an extended and carefully prepared speech in the senate yesterday with anarchy as his theme, and was followed by some brief remarks by Mr. Hoar of Massachu setts on the difficulties in the way of dealing with anarchist assassins. Mr. McComas' remarks showed careful ex amination of the legal authorities. He maintained that congress had full pow under the constitution to enact a law punishing with death any person killing a president or assaulting iha president with intent to kill, or aiding. Inciting or'procuring such an act. He favored-rigid provisions in the Immi gration laws for the deportation of alien anarchists. Much of the speech was devoted to an explanation of the dr.tigerous doctrines of anarchy, and the extent to which these doctrines had been propagated -within recent years. Senator Hoar's remarks were interest ing, coming from the venerable chair Man of the-judiciary committee, which will have much to do with the framing of any legislation on this subject. Ha said that the difficulty was that assas sins of-kings and rulers always gloried In their crimes and were in no wise de terred by the fear of punishment. For this reason he thought was almost useless to multiply punishments. The most effective remedy' he suggested wculd be to have the civilized nations of the world agree upon some desolate spot on the earth's surface, to which all anarchists who uphold assassina tion'or the gverthrow of government should be transported^ In such a com munity the anarchist could ca'rry^out his theories of living without a gov ernment and the world would be rid of his presence. The senate passed a bill extending the life of the industrial commission until Feb. 15, next to complete the work it,now has in hand. The commit tee which will consider an appropriate tribute to the late president McKinley was announced. The senate adjourned until next Monday.
