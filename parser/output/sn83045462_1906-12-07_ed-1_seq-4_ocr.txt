This paragraph from the President's message should be favorably considered by Congress at once: "I again recommend a law prohibiting all firporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill lias already passed one house of Congress. Ijrt individuals contribute as they desire, but let us prohibit In effective fashion all from making contributions for any political purpose, directly or Indirectly." It is highly probable that Uie corporations liave never given as lil/erally to the managing politicians as rumor has represented. Such a topic easily leads to exaggeration. But they have given largely, and to both Phi ties, and ever since President Havemeyer of the Sugar Trust made his admission on the witness stand In this town twelve years ago sentiment against the practice has been growing. It is now very strong, and the law asked for by the President should be passed. We shall not then, however, have solved the question of too much money in our elections. Something more must be done to correct an evil which even then will lie great. The corporations were prac tii-all.v barred from the recent campaign, but neither party went hungry. Both were well supplied with the sinews of war, and both made use of all the old devices?some of thom expensive?for stirring up the voters ami getting them to the polls. No individual contribution, with one exception, was large, but a great many were received, and the total, in the case of the one parties of tlie other, was substantial. It still appeared that we were doing campaign business on a generous financial scale. The exception mentioned was startling \i. ir?.,t I I 1 < 1 I'll! < !

That is to say. he had spent at least that much money in an effort to be elected governor of New York. Few men can afford such an outlay, and fewer still are disposed to make it in quest of political honors. But the question is, should a man able and disposed to make it be permitted to do so? Should he be permitted to buy his way to place in such fashion? As legislation should not be sold?and the ruling of corporations out of politics is to f-revent that ?should offices be left open to traffic? Had Mr. Hearst been successful at the polls his bill of expenses would of itself have been a cloud upon his commission which nothing could have dispelled. But how may this sort of thing be remedied'.' You cannot bar rich men from aspiring to office, and, as Mr. Hearst has ? 1."1. n-Vw.n rlrv ocnira t Vin Jl lllin

Although a coroner's jury has declared tli.it no responsibility for the death of the prisoner Colston attaches to the members of the police department, the public will be prom- to ask whether this case does not ii 'innate the demand for a general revision of the system of treating drunken in won. i * in the police stations of Washington. A few months ago a stranger in tliij* fity. a citizen of West Virginia, died in h police cell and the case disclosed that although he had been arrested as a "drunk" he had probably been given poison for purposes of robbery. He had received no medical treatment whatever, and his death was. apparently, due to the fact th.it he lay for hours unattended. No one wis men iormaiiy uiamca jur win* neguin c. it beins evidently a case which did lint seriously violate the rules of the department. Since then, however, orders have been issued calling for a more frequent examination of prisoners. In the Colston case the man was classified at tile time of his arrest a.s intoxicated. Jle should have been rated as a patient as well as a prisoner. He was allowed to "sleep It off." He slept practically to his death. Of course the police could not have known that he had been injured mortally. But if a nhvslcian had been on duty at the station house this case would perhaps have ended differently. At all events the man would have had a chance for his life. There should be established here In Washington a central police station provided with hospital wards, to which should be taken all prisoners suffering from illness or intoxication. These prisoners should he given medical treatment. This is the only humane way to dispose of the victims of the drink habit. They are in need of attention at all times and they should no longer be rated as mere incumbrances Hi.d thrown into cells to sleep or suffer Slid run lilt? nan in ut-aiu imuus" mancution. If the police department lacks funds or authority now to provide such a central m ?tion it should be provided with the means through early legislation. Recent experiences will always leave a lingfring hope that the Allegheny mountains may stand as an effectual protection to the eastern public from a cold-wave prediction. Jl.irry Thaw can never complain that his C tse was railroaded through court. The Proposition From Des Moines. A reply to The Star's inquiry of yesterday respecting an overhauling of the Constitution has come more promptly than expected. The resolutions of the Des Moines convention now in session considering the question of e'ecting United States senators by popular vote, after complaining of the Senate's refusal to assist In that movement, contain the following: "That while this convention would much prefer that Congress should submit to the several slates a proposed amendment to the Constitution for the election of senators by direct vote of the people, so that the states might p.iss upon It as a single question, yet Inasmuch as the Senate persistently refuses to submit such anendment. it therefore earnest^ r< commends that the legislatures of the several states do. in pursuance o( Article IV of the Constitution of the United Slates, make application to the Congress tu call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments to the Constitution of the I'nited States." A large majority of the states are represented at this convention by delegates named by the governors. The Importance oi lilt.' uiirciiw^ nas iruigniiru, nnu luc uusiness Intrusted to men of reputation and experience. Politics does not enter into the matter at all. Democrats and republicans, differing widely on other issues, are agreed as to the question of senatorial elections, and in discussing that have come to an agreement as to this larger question. Well, whv not a constitutional convention? What but good could come of it? The debates in themselves would b? of the greatest value. To such a body none but men of recognized learning in the law and nnt-nrn?nnn( nrmiM Kn nnnf o n*1 frAni thijil' gutri iimriii T?UUm uc ocut. aiiu in/m i"?*-. ?conferences and discussions everybodywould be able to extract something of value. The Constitution as it stands has occasioned no end of disputes. Great lawyers and great publicists have all along been found on either side of the line. We have had from the beginning, and have now. a strict construction school ajcid a liberal construction school, and all sorts of meanings have been read into, and then rn'xl ..lit .. f thn mora iiVinnrlint nmvinlniW ? cau VUV Vil ilic ?11VI t lUtlV of the instrument. But more vital than this is the fact that things have changed so much with us in the past fifty years. In many particulars we httve a new country. In that time we have fought two wars, one of them for the preservation of the government Itself, and from both inherited new problems of the highest Importance. The states were welded together by the civil war. and since then we have been operating largely on centralized principles, while as a result of the war with* Spain we have acquired territory far from our [tase, ana caning ior new nnuucs iu the exercise of both executive and legislative functions. We are not going backward in our national'life. and we cannot stand still. For-, ward is the law of a vigorous body politic, and if the national chart needs substantial revision?always preserving of course the principles of liberty and equality before the law?revision should be made. At any rate, why not formally and officially discuss the whole subject? "Bob" Taylor on Bryan. Senator-elect Taylor of Tennessee?people Insist upon calling him "Bob"?has been in Kilt fnll II fl t imp trt ICVllll ill) 111 ??? ~ talk politics. His admirers, interested as they are in all he says, seem to care more for his views about publlQ men ar . public issues of the day than for his "word-paintings" of this, that, and the other. At any rate wherever he goes he is interrogated about current political matters,- and he always obliges his interrogators. He tells them what they want to know, in terms both to Instruct and to entertain, and never shies at any topic. Mr. Taylor is a Bryan man. It must be the Nebraskan's eloquence that has such a grip 011 his admiration. Something has, for despite his two defeats for the presidency, his ineffective campaign for Judge barker In 11MJ4 and his equally ineffective effort to elect democratic representatives this year, as well as his declaration in favor of government ownership and operation of railroads. of which Mr. Taylor does not approve, Mr. Bryan still appears to the Tennessee leader as the strongest man in the democratic party, and the one who should j be nominated in 1908. [ Mr. Taylor sees no difficulty in taking Mr. Bryan and leaving Mr. Bryan's doctrines. He says that the party will write the platform, putting Its disapproval on government ownership of railroads, and then place the standard in Mr. Bryan's hands. He does not seem to doubt that Mr. Bryan will accept on the party's terms, and pledge himself to be guided by the party's wishes. In other words. Mr. Taylor sees Mr. Bryanno loneer the leader but the led, and anx ions enough now for office to follow where the party Judgment directs. Out of what this confidence grows is not clearly apparent. Mr. Bryan was leading when he spoke in the Madison Square Garden, and has been leading ever since, despite the storm of protest awakened by that address. Whether before western, southern, or middle state audiences, he has continued to expound his railroad views, in n u-9v to testify to their, absolute, siilr. eerity. His only concession has been 1n an admission that he might be ahead of his party on the issue, but this was coupled with an intimation that he fully expected his party to "catch up." If put to the test suggested by Mr. j Taylor will Mr. Bryan yield? Were he to run for President on a platform accepted as condemning the issue of government railroads, Mr. Bryan in office could not in honor move in that direction. The influence of the presidency while he exercised it could not be thrown as Mr. Bryan would feel it should be with regard to a policy more important in his eyes than any he has espoused since he staked all on silver. A Nippy Day. Boreas and Jack Frost got busy together early this morning and gave Washington a nip of the real thing in the way of winter weather. There was only a sprinkling of snow, but it served warning of what may come later. The thermometer shrank from the chill blasts until it registered below 30. It was not so very cold, but It ? ~Hica crr?ap?.hlf?. The wind played havoc. It drove the chill air Into the houses and rattled the windows and buffeted the unfortunates who had to venture abroad. It made a plaything of the man who carried the banner in the minstrel parade. He was earning alT that was coming to him. He was a spectacle worth watching. Imagine a man carrying a sail head-on against the wind on a day like this! Especially in the middle of Pennsylvania avenue! Watching him, other men forgot their troubles and laughed loud and inr.tr miH ahile thus diverted some of them permitted the wind to toy with their hats and they went racing oft in pursuit. It was lively work, today, trying to live in Washington. And while the cold wind blew In the open, the hot-air blast on Capitol Hill did its best to temper the atmosphere, but without avail beyond the marble walls. Life is various and diverting in the capital city at times. Considering the salaries paid by insurance companies and other business enterprises. a request for ?7,D00 a year for a statesman in Congress does, on the whole, seem rather modest. With Mr. Wellman discussing his departure and Mr. Peary discussing his return there is no danger inai me suojeci or arctic exploration will not be well covered. There would not be so much Indignation if some of the western coal operators would be content to raise the price without precipitating an actual famine. Mr. Bryan has had his troubles, and had them on a large scale. But he has never been seized by any fixed determination to serve in the ranks. Russia may yet accumulate enough energy in Asia to keep the Japanese too busy to think of war with the other side of the world. The coal lands in the west may yet arouse David B. Hill to re-enter public life with a i few government ownership suggestions. Bryan on Professional Soldiers. Mr "Rrvan riptpots and dpnlorps a "war like tone" in the President's references to 1 the army and navy. He says: "War ought ! ! to be a last resort, not a first considera' tlon. It is bad enough to have a few professional soldiers." Yes, Indeed. A beautiful sentiment, as a sentiment. But would Mr. i Bryan have no professional soldiers at all? ' Will he pledge himself if elected President to recommend smaller appropriations for West Point and Annapolis, and a return to the olJ figure of twenty-Are thousand for the army? We could not have too little of a bad thing. Mr. Bryan as a critic In private life, fi^urin* on cam paigfi material. Is a very different man, we may be sure, from wh*t he* would be as President of the United States ehareed with the duty of making recommendations to Congress on the subject of the general welfare. California hints that President Roosevelt has not taken the same pains toward informing himself on the Japanese question that he has taken with reference to the Panama canal. The average Christmas shopper is waiting to ascertain Just how he is benefited by the treasury's action in prepaying interest and 1 putting extra cash Into circulation. ? The Shah of .Persia was too Important a patient not to be made the subject of a doctors' disagreement. It looks as if the "man with the muck rake" had again started on the trail of one or two senators. annrvrnrn ST 1DQ ouuvx jjn vi w* *? *ww? ^ Easily Avoided. "Above all things," said the sincere friend to the new congressman, "avoid getting proud and haughty." "That's easy," was the answer, "every time I feel myself losing my grip on my humility, I'll think of the size of my salary." "If I had stahted out in de fus' place," said Uncle Bben, "takln" all de good advice i I passed around. I reckin I'd soon have been kep" too busy to think up any mo'." Fortunes of Famous Men. This Is the program of successIt should be otherwise. You win your millions more or less. And then apologize. Dangerous Ground. "That man is utterly lacking in the most ordinary sense of propriety," said the sensational authoress. "What has he done?" "He actually tried to discuss some of the details of my latest book with me!" Discretion. "You are not as popular as you might be," said the friend. "I don't want to be any idol of the masses," answered Senator Sorghum. "It's better not to have them hypnotized into a state of unreasoning admiration. There is liable to be too much of a reaction when they wake up." An Effort at Content. I haven't any railway stocks to irritate my mind When interstate embarrassments arise; In the movements of the markets it is not my rate to nnd A thing to agitate me or surprise. I haven't any interests in corporations great Nor dealings with the crafty lawyer folk. Nobody e'er reviles me as a danger to the state. I'd be happy?if I only wasn't brose. There's no one camping on my trail with philanthropic plans For which I am supposed to have the cash: I never risk my fortune to annex another man's: I'm quite immune from speculation rash. I have no motor car to keep me worried night and day. This life would seem a long and gentle joke, Kxcept for one slight hindrance that is sadly in the way. I d be happy?if I only wasn't broke! Railroad "Accidents." From the New York Herald. Do the public realize the enormous number of nersons killed anuuallv In railroad accidents in the United btates? Do they know that In the careless, happy-go-lucky manner in which our railways are operated 0,7(C5 persons lost their lives and 8<S,00S were injured during the last fiscal year? This is not guess work. Those are official figures. Think of it! Nearly 10,000 dead, and not for from 100,000 maimed within a twelvemonth, by systems that send carloads of freight and passengers rushing over the country, pell mell, in a devil-may-care fashion, with the result of trains ditched here, others ploughing into each other there, grade crossings having wieir victims at numerous places, and wrecks such as the latest holocaust on Thanksgiving day, near l>ynchburg, Va., constituting another chapter in the ever continued tale of American railway tragedies. That is the cold, solid truth ulukiit it Tt id not tr? hp Hpnipd nr softened down, or managerially glossed over with would-be indignant assertion that accidents are unavoidable and often due to what old-fashioned bills of lading called the "act of God." Why Shop Early P From the Chicago Post. There are several excellent reasons why you should do your Christmas shopping as early as you possibly can, but the chief one is?or should be?concern for the cltrks in the stores who have to bear the brunt of the extra holiday buying. It is because of the hardships that holiday shopping places on the young women, girls, and even children, in the stores, that a national effort is being made to induce buyers to be more thoughtful. for it is merely through thoughtlessness that many stoppers delay their holiday buying to the last possible moment. Newspapers and merchants throughout the country are joining in an effort to bring it home to millions of shoppers that they can benefit themselves and everyone concerned if they will do their Christmas buying early in the season and early in the day, thus lengthening the holiday shopping period and reducing the disadvantages usually attendant upon the holiday crowds.
