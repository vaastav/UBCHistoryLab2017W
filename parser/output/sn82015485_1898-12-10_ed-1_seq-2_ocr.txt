WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular correspondent. "Washington, Dec. 5, 1898. President McKinley's annual mes sage to Congress is a thoroughly pa triotic document from start to finish. There is not a word of partisanship In it. The message will not only be read witli interest, but it will becare fully preserved, as it is an authentic, condensed history of events leading to the war with Spain, of the war, and of the results of the war, so far as they are known at this time. It is, in itself, alone, sufficient to place President McKinley in the very front ranks of American statesmen, if he had not already attained that posi tion. It is necessarily long, but con tains no platitudes, no striving after effect nor bids for popular favor. It is a plain statement of some of the most important events in the coun try's history, -made by a man whose patriotism has been proven by trials such as few men have gone tli rough. It ought to be read in every school house in the land aud studied as a les - son in current American history. Even the most partisan Democrats find nothing in it to object to, which is something decidedly unusual in Presidents' messages. t t t The attendance at the opening of congress was quite up to the average, both on the floor of tue uuuse aud senate and in tne galleries. Speaker Reed opened the house, tiis smiling face indicating a contentment ttiat must have been envied by those Dem ocrats who have for months past been engaged in overthrowing him, on pa per. Vice President llobart presided over the opening of the senate in his usual urbane and dignified manner. Among the noted senatorial absentees were Senators Davis of Minnesota, Frye of Maine, and Gray of Deleware, who are detained iu Paris bv their work as American Peace Commission ers, but who expect to complete the treaty of peace and start for home in a few days, the difficult part having been accomplished when the Spanish commissioners agreed to our terms, a week ago. t t t No man is better authority on things congressional than Senator Al lison, chairman of the committee on appropriation. His opinions carry weight because of his loug experience and the correctness of his judgment in the past.' He said of the session of congress that opened to-day: "In my opinion, the session will be an inter est ohe, and many of the debates will be of great importance." Of the pros pect of legislation he said: "It can be laid down as a safe rule that if any measure proposed is antagonized by a determined minority, it will be withdrawn. There will be great pres sure in behalf of legislation for the Nicaragua canal, and if any import ant measure is passed, outside of the appropriation biHs, it will be the Canal bill: That subject has been so thoroughly threshed over that it ought not to provoke much debate." Of the Treaty of Peace with Spain he said: "It will be ratified beyond a doubt, and exactly as it comes to us from the Peace Commission. We can not afford to stultify ourselves in the face of the world by refusing to ac cept the work of the commissioners. They have been very careful and de serve the endorsement of the country. I shall be in favor of prompt action, because we ought to dispose of the matter and not let it remain in a state of uncertainty. We want to settle as soon as possible our relations to the Philippines, ana this we can not do until the treaty is ratified. All our farmer readers should take advantage of the unprecedented club bing offer we this year make, which includes, with this paper, The Live Stock Indicator, its Special Farmers' Institute editions, The Poultry Far mer, The Farmers' Mutual Insurance Journal and the Humane Alliance. The subscription price of of these five publications amounts to S2.80, while our own paper is $1.00, a total of $3.80. We are prepared to send them all, in cluding our own paper, to any farmer in this county for $1.43, which is only 45 cents more than our own subscrip tion price. Never before was so much superior reading matter, of the most practical and useful character, offered for only $1.45. The first four of the naners named are so well known throughout the west that but little j need to be said of them. They com- ' mend themselves to the reader's fa vorable attention upon mere mention, j The Humane Alliance is devoted to humane education, and should be in every farmer's family, so that the boys and girls on the farm may early im bibe the principles of a broad human ity that shall include all God's creat ures, and learn the wickedness and brutalizing tendency of cruelty of all kinds. Take advantage of this great offer. Two Pointed Questions Answered. What is the use of making a better article than your competitor if you cannot get a better price for it? Ans. As there is no difference in the price the public will buy only the better, so that while our profits may be smaller on a single sale they will be much larger in the aggregate. How can you get the public to know your make is the best? If both articles are brought promi nently before the public both are cer tain to be tried and the public will very quickly pass judgment on them and use only the better one. This explains the large sale on Chamberlain's Cough Ilemedv. The people have been using it for years and have found that it can be depend ed upon. They may occasionally take up with some fashionable novelty put fortli with exaggerated claims, but are certain to return to the one reme dy that they know to be reliable, and for coughs, colds and croup there is nothing equal to Chamberlain's Couah lieniedy.
