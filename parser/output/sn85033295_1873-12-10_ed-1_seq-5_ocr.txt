The market for al! kinds of stock had an upward tendency, and matters took a lively turn on the streets. The merchants seemed quite busy with customers, and altogether it was a stirring day in town. ■ - • Congregational Convent leu. The Semi-Annual Meeting of the Madison Congregation a! Convention is now w ses sion at the Congregational Church in this city. The|proceedings will close this (Wed nesday) evening, at which time several able addresses will be delivered on the subject of temperance. Among those expected to speak on this question are Rev. AL M. Mar tin, Rev, A. H. Miner, Rev. J. Montague, and Rev. C. H. Richards. This portion of the proceedings will be made quite interest ing, and should call together a large atten dance.

A Mild Season. Thus far our winter in this section has been of the mildest type for many years. Up to this time, now nearly the middle o December, the theremorueter has not fallen below zero, and no violent snow storms have occurred. Surely it is a providential circumstance that the winter should be so open all over the country at a period when so many of the laboring classes are out of employment. Such a winter as last would engender great suffering among the poor. O Small but Interesting Affair. The performance of the Tom Thumb Troupe at Turner Hall Tuesday evening[of lust week called out a full house and gave very general satisfaction to those present The “little folks” were in good trim, and did their level best to satisfy their audience. The delineations and acting of Commodore Nutt called forth, as they well deserved, the strongest encomiums, and ho proved himself an actor of no ordinary calibre. Tom Thumb begins to look old, but be and his diminitive wife appeared to good advant age, while the petit Minnie Warren won the plaudits of all by her self possession and graceful manner. .Personal, W.

An exhibition of representatives of the aborigine race in the vacant store in John W. Cole's block, was among the attractions of the last “fair day.” If the artist who pictured these specimens of “ye gentle sav ages” on the canvass which hung outside was at al! striking in his delineations, then the originals on the inside could double discount Captain Jack or any of his tribe on hideousuess ot expression and not more than half try. The President’s Message. On the inside of this number ot the Re publican we publish verbatim the message of President Grant delivered to both Houses of Congress last week. It is a clear, suc cinct and carefully worded document, and contains valuable information regarding the condition of the nation at the present time. Sumo of the President’s recommendations are well taken, and will command the at tention ot the county. No one should be without reading this excellent message. Auothcr Old Citi zeu Gone. Mr. Tidfothy J. Kelley, died at the resi dence of his daughter, Mrs. Richard Shi n niek. in the town of Watertown of inflamma tion of the last Saturday evening, December Gth. Mr. Kelley came to this place from the East about 30 years ago, and while '.Vatertpwu was yet a village, held several posh ions of responsibility and trust* Some years since Mr. KelleyJtnoved ( from the city to the town ot Shields, where he re sided up to within a short period of his death. In his later years Mr, Kelley met with many reverses in life, and the shadow of misfortune crossed his path. But lie nev er lost bis dignity and self possession, and he died respected by all who knew him. He was about Go years of age. Procectlings of Scliool Board. Permission has been granted Mr. J. Kal tenbrun, Principal of Union School No. 2, to use during evenings oue of the rooms of Union School No 2 for the purpose of pri vate instruction. Mr. K. to procure the necessary light and firewood at his own ex pense. The resignation of Mr. J. Flavin, Princi pal of Union School No. 3, was tendered to tiie School Board and accepted. The Su perintendent recommended the following transfer of teachers rendered necessary by the resignation of Mr. J. Flavin, which was adopted by the Board : Mr. Ch Ninman to the Principalship of Union School No 3. Miss Ellen Reilly to the Second Grammar Grade, Union School No. 1. Mr. J. Whyte to be Second Assistant, in the High School Department. Miss Anna Norris to the first Primary Grade, Union School No. 1.

The proposed appointees to receive the same salaries as their respective predeces sors except Miss Ellen Reilly who is to re ceive $4O per month instead of the $5O paid lo Mr. Ninman .

The Superintendent was di re cfed to purchase at the lowest terms 100 cords of Maple wood for the use of the schools of the City, 60 cords of green, and 40 cords of dry, this amount to include the wood already bought this Fall. The Board Committee on Buildings was requested to examine the condition of the Cupolas on Union School House No. 2 and 3 and have the same thoroughly repaired. From the National Capitol. Washington, Dec. 7, 1573. Editor Republican : The opening of the Forty-third Congress, which took place on Monday last, marks the recurrence of the harvest time ofibe permanent citizens of Washington who in ienumerable ways benefit by the increase of the temporary residents brought here during the sessions of Congress, and the cl<y therefore at the present time presents quite a lively spectacle, the streets and all public places being crowded with visitors Many of these arc brought here as office seekers, hoping that members will be able to squeeze them into someone of the De partments or gel them a position under the new officers in the House. The opening scenes on Monday last were attended with the usual' excitement and cits tie. not oi -y the galleries being crowded several Lours before the opening, but even the lluors of the House being well filled bv fGenus of members who by special perruis su a in each case were admitted to the floor. The election of officers, drawing for seats and other incidents to the opening created much noise and confusion, while in the donate everything was serene and quiet, and business promptly attended to. The number of members bus been, as you are aware, materially increased, bu t the space outside the seats remain about the , same, w hile the desks of the members and the aisles have been made smaller Among all the members, old and uew“ } the Hon, Alexander Stephens, of Georgia, Ex-Vice President of the Southern Confederacy, at tracted the most attention. While weak and feeble in physical bralth, bent down with rheumatism and walking by the aid of crutches only, his bright and piercing eye give evidence that his menial faculties are unimpaired. By unanimous consent |be was allowed to choose his own seat —the same one occupied by him when, before the rebellion, he was a member of the House* Hon, John A. Kasson, of lowa, also attracted attention as a former member newly return ed and one who has and will in future ma ke his mark in (he political world. Then of course of the old members, Butler, Blaine, Poland, Fernando Wood, Cox and many others were eagerly sought out byjstrangers. Of in existing laws only one has yet been decided on, at least as far as the House is concerned. That is the re peal of the salary bill, and the consequent reduction in the amount of salary to Mem bers of Congress to the old $5OOO, the voice of the people, as heard through the late elections, having been so distinctly, agains L the increase. Whether the Senate will agree is another question, but the Demo crats will in all probability oppose the re peal. The President’s Message is a. plain and straightforward ’document, such as we are in the habit of expecting from that source. It contains many recommendations worthy of the attention of Congress, and lias quiet ed any fears relative to war with any for eign power. No important legislation, perhaps with the exception of the repeal of the salary .bill need be expected before the holidays, in connection with this matter it may be stated as rather a curious circumstance that even General Butler, who was the father of the increase and its persistent defender, ad mitted that the people were opposed to it, and was understood now to tavor its re peal. Nothing has yet been heard from Senator Carpenter on the subject. W. , m . . Editor Republican : Dear Sir—When a man can see “riotous cheer” and banners of “personal liberty,’’ where they do not exist, it is not at all as tonishing that he should mistake a chal lenge to sustain a point of discussion for a request to obtain spiritual advice ! The comparison of the “old Roman,” in troduced into the Rev. Critic's last,*is quite romantic. It will, however, be admitted, even looking at things in their most favor able light, that this old Roman was in a pretty tight place. But what I failed to scl was the Roman, in any sense of the word. What Ido see is a “weak Methodist Preacher” who has been driven from behind every breastwork, where he had intrenched himself, and now, the very spectre of an ad versary, flits across ..he field, seeking refuge in every nook, dodging every rnisslc, and always refusing battle. He max continue in that way just so long as he finds in it any pleasure; like the old woman who kept turning Iter wheel long after her yarn was all spun. It w ill be time enough to notice him when he says anything, "a the mean time he may mew, and try to scratch. In order to equal ray assailant in rude ness, it is not my intention to descend to the levo.l of a man who knows not how to blush, although he stands before the public convicted of ignorance, or cowardice, or bad fai'h, and of something very like cal umny. In what should be a calm discussion all personalities should be avoided. Whilst the matter in dispute could be looked upon lightly, 1 was careful not to seek to render it over serious. But when my opponent came out under his own signature, and seemed desirous to discuss questions serious ly and systematically, he found me there. And should he, even now, wish to continue the argument seriously, he will find me scill prepared. I excuse all from a violation of the excise law on thejldth, in the same way, as I would excuse a raffle at a religious fair, by saying that custom justifies it; and custom does justify it, in case custom is the best inter preter of laws. • Now does my opponent say that custom is not the best interpreter of laws? Isay that an armed procession for a religions end is not a violaiion of the Sun day, and 1 again defy him to prove it is. if a point of this kind is to be despised as a ‘lameduck of Theology,” then why intro duce il ? When I hear a man undertaking to preach morality, and that this mm teaches, that. Faith alone saves, 1 feel thatgl have a right lo inquire, why he insists upon anything further than faith. Wfien a man teaches, that each s oa 'is free to interpret, for him self, the laws of God, then I am naturally curious to learn why he dares to find fault with any one who may exercise the Gghi which he, himself, concedes. Hence the two questions which I pat in my second last article. They were in order, sines they underlie the very foundation ">f the discus sion. If then he means straightforward ar gumerit, and not insignificant quibbling ; if he is anjiioaest man, and not a contempt." ble pettifogger, let him staud for’h like u man and define his position, by answering these questions. This will ba much mire becoming for one of his pretentions, than to skulk out of a difficulty, by runn ng on a wild gosse chase, or striving to be .severe, when he has not yet learned to be so, un less at the expense of common politeness. Until he has done this he only renders him self ridiculous by showing how he would act if a victor, and exulting in the imagi nary humiliation of one whose shoes he is fit to buckle. Believe me, Mr. Editor, as ever your most obedient and humble ser vant, D. A. TIG HE. -Seini-^loccTf. Jefferson. The Masonic Ball and Festival on Thurs day evening at Zobrlaut’s Hall, was decidedly a success in every respect. The hall was filled to overflowing, and at an early hour the dancing commeuced and continued uninterrupted until the “we sma hours of the morn.” Everybody seem ed to enjoy themselves, ss it was impossi ble to do otherwise as ibe arrangements were perfect in every particular. The mu sic discoursed by “Richard’s Quadrille Band’ was of a high order and strerior quality giving entire satisfaction to the company. Mr, N. Jung, has sold his stock of goods to Mr. P. W. Birkhauser. We are sorry to lose Mr. Jung as a business man, and are glad that he will remain among us as a private citizen. Mr. J. D. Royce, of Oak’and, trapped and caught an old thief who had been commit ting depredations among bis sheep of late Mr. Royce's flock has suffered to the extent of seven sheep and lambs; for wh'cbheis reimbursed with one large nice Wclf skin, and about sls in bounty.— Banner. Fort Atkinson. A movement is afoot among some of our most influential citizens to induce Rev. 0. Caverno, to deliver his really fine lecture entitled “Boots,” at this place during the holidays or thereabouts. We hope by all means thtft the movement will be success ful. It is one of the most original and pleasing lectures we have ever heard and is just the thing to stir up intellectually. We need as a people just such mental food as this lecture furnishes, and we hope that.if Mr. Caverno comes, he will be greeted with one of those “lip top” audiences Fort At kinson can furnish if it has a mind to. Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed by many of the prominent citizens of the village of Jefferson, over t,be recent action of the Board of Supervisors in annexing the southern tier of sections in that town, to the town of Koshkonong. They give the situation as follows : Ist. In equity the ceded territory is re sponsible for its share of the indebtedness of the whole. 2d. That a pro rata share of the tax for previous indebtedness will certainly be lev ied on the property holders of these sections whicli in all probability they resist. This will end in a long course ot litigation, ex pensive to both parties. To ug it seems as if the first position was a just one, although we do not know what the law is on that subject. We are decidedly in favor of re ceiving these sections, providing it can be done in justice to all, bat if it is going to entail lawsuits and bad feeling; between towns, wc are not in favor of it.— Union. Waterloo There is not a town of its size in the State that ships near as much butter as Waterloo :loes. It is not an uncommon sight to see rom ten to twenty wagon loads at the de pot awaiting shipment. It is expected that the C hristmas ball in the Badger State Hall will prove the at traction of the season. Mr. Bond is de tarminedjthat it shall offipse ail other affairs of its kind in this village. The small boys of tins village are about as precocious a set as one will meet with in many a day. They are fit graduates for Chicago newsboys. ; •—— List of Letters remaining in the Post Office, at Watertown.
