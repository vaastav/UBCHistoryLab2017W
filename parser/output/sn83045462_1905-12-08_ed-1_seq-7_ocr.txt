RAILWAY RATE BILLS Analysis of Principal Meas ures Now in Congress. M AINFE AT URES'OFE AC 0 SOKE BELIEVE PRESENT LAWS ARE SUFFICIENT. Revised Esch-Townsend Intel-state Commerce Measures and Outline of Senator El kins' Bill. There Is practical unanimity among sena tors and representatives as to the desira bility of legislation that will strengthen the existing lawn against rebates and discrimi nations of all kinds between shippers, and especially as to the desirability of such leg islation as will enable rebates and discrimi nations obtained through the medium of private freight cars, private terminal roads and other devices and subterfuges to be reached effectively. The one point lnvolv I ed In the proposed railway legislation on which there are serious differences at opin ion Is as to the best method of providing a means for effectively and promptly cor recting a rate that may be exorbitant or unreasonably high. There are some men In both houses who believe that the present la.ws are sufficient for the correction of such rates, especially in view of the recent action of two United States Judges, In the Georgia yellow pine lumber case and the Proctor & Gamble soap case, in summarily enjoining railways from charging more Uian the interstate commerce commission had found to be reasonable rates. The great majority of senators and representatives, however, believe that additional legislation, In some form, Is needed to make the reme dies for unjust and unreasonable ratee more effective, but there are wide differences of opinion as to what form such legislation should take. The President's Recommendation. In his message to Congress President Roosevelt recommends that the Interstate commerce commission or some other ad ministrative body be given the power "to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go-^the maximum reasonable rate, as It is commonly called? this decision to go Into effect within a rea sonable tlfrie and to obtain from thence on ward, subject to review by the courts." Several hills and outlines of bills have been prepared proposing to carry out this recom mendation, either In letter or in spirit. The revised EJsch-Townsend bill, the bill pre pared by the interstate commerce commis sion ind tihe outline of a -bill prepared1 by Senator Bikins all propose to carry out this provision specifically, except that the Bsch-Townsend bill and the commission bill both propose to give the commission power to make minimum rates as well as maximum and to fix differentials, which the President did not recommend. Except for this departure from the President's mes sage by these two measures each of the three would be a strict compliance with the recommendation of the message, and yet there is a vital difference 'between the El kins outline and the other bills. That this agreement with the message and disagree ment among themselves is possible is due to the fact that the President did not un dertake to make specific recommendations as to the method by which a decision of the commission should be reviewed by the courts. All of the bills profess to provide for the ultimate review of an order issued bv the commission in the United States courts. Yet it Is contended by many senators that the Eiklnsblll is the only one of the three that would provide for or permit any real review of the real question at Issue?that is as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the rate or rates that had been chal.enged. It was because of Uhis same failure of the original Esch-Townsend bill to provide for adequate review that President Spencer or the Southern railway referred to it as a proposition to subject the railway property of the country to "commercial lynch law." Senator El-kins propose? to provide that If the c.->urt "shall find that the rate fixed by such carrier was not unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful it shall enter a decree setting aside such or der." It Is apparent that this would bring the question as to the original rate before the court an dmake it the basi sof the pro ceedings in review. Under either the Eteeh-Townsend bill or the commission bill, however, this would be Impossible. Both of these bills it is claimed by those who have studied them seek to limit the reviewing court to the single ques tion as to the legality of the order issued by the commission. The theory under which the commission would prescribe rates un der either of these bills would be that it was exercising delegated legislative powers and Its orders would be substantially laws w,ih the same force as though each of them had been specifically enacted by Con gress. It Is a well settled principle that the courts will not review an act within the discretion of the legislative branhc of the government, and It Is declared' that it fol lows that an order of the commission made under either of these bills could only be set aside on the ground that the oonstitutiooal limitation of the legislative power had been exceeded and that the rate prescribed was confiscatory. The Unreasonably High and Unreason ably Low Rate. Chairman Knapp of the interstate com merce commission has said that between the unreasonably high rate and the unrea sonably low or confiscatory rate "there is a considerable, and In many cases, a very considerable margin which measures the range of legislative discretion." In other words, although the rate that had been challenged might have been within this margin and might have been perfectly just and reasonable this fact could not be con sidered by the court. The rate prescribed by the commission, on the other hand, might be unreasonable and might work injustice to carriers, to shippers or com munities, tut, unless it could be shown that It would operate actually to confis cate the property of some one, It could not be set aside by the reviewing court. An other point made against these bills is that they propose to limit the right to institute proceedings for review to cal-risrs and do not provide for such proceedings being in stituted by either shippers or communities that might be disastrously affected by changes in rates that would change the rel ative adjustment of rates affecting rival communities. It is regarded as conceiv able, especially if either of these bills pro viding for the fixing of minimum rate* as wsll as maximum, should become a law, that a carrier might not ,be interested In applying for a review of an order directing it to raise a rate or forbidding the reduc tion of a rate below a certain figure, and yet such an order might be destructive of an Industry or of a community. One of the objections urged against the Bikins plan is that it would Involve double proceedings, first in the. commission and then In the court, and would prolong the life of controversies. - The same la true of any proposition to have the commission fix a rate and then have a Judicial review thougti It is probable that there would be fewer reviews under a law that would take away from the court jurisdiction over the original question than there would be under one providing for a review of the real ques tion at issue, as Is proposed by Senator Elkins. It is for this reason that Senator Doillver, one of the most extreme advo cates of commission-made rates, has de clared that he would prefer the Foraker bill that would take the matter Into the courts In the beginning. The Foraker Bill. The Foraker bill Is radically different from the other propositions that have been advanced in that It Is presented to carry out the recommendations of the President in sulMtance, without adhering to the strict letter of his message. It is claimed by iu advocates that the results aimed at would be accomplished by this bill more certainly and more expeditiously than by any other proposition that has been formula ted Sen ator Foraker would eliminate the inter state commerce commission entirely ex cept as an inv?etl?atin* and prosecuting FOR

He would have the court exer cise the purely Judicial function of passing on the question as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate, one process through which t'he court would necessarily have to go being that of determining what would be a maximum reasonable rate. He would then have the court exercise another purely judicial function In summarily enjoining the carrier from charging more than this maximum reasonable rate, claiming t?lat this would give to both shipper and carrier the right to a day In court and the full protection of the laws. It would also do apray with the double proceedings and the prolongation of the life of controversies op posed by Senator Dolliver.
