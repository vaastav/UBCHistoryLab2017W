Tomlin of this city, was drowned in the Mus selshell river Monday afternoon while playing on the ice with a number of other children. The sad accident hap pened above the dam near Newton's ice house near which place the parents of the dead girl live. The children were engaged in throwing sticks on the thin ice and going out after them. The Tomlin girl in some manner stumbled and fell into the water and being caught by the current was quick ly swept beyond the reach of her com panions who might have otherwise ren dered assistance. The body was carri ed under the ice. The county officials were immediately notified and efforts to recover the body were commenced but without success until about six o'clock this evening when the body was found about 200 yards below where the girl fell in. Many pounds of dynamite were used to blast the I ice and in an endeavor to raise the body but all seemed in vain. A num ber of men volunteered their services to dive in the ice cold water in search of the body but this also proved futile. The funeral of the little girl will be held tomorrow interment to be made in the city cemetery. 

WILL VOTE ON A NEW COUNTY Will Embrace Portions of 8weet Grass, Carbon and Yellowstone. I BILLINGS, Dec. 3.—Voters of the I territory embraced within the propos I ed limits of Stillwater county, will be given the opportunity of voting upon the question of the creation of that county on March 26, for the board of i commissioners has decided that the petition therefore is sufficient and the { date for determining the question is fixed as stated. I Three protests against forming the county were placed on file, but two of them lacked the necessary 50 per cent of qualified voters and were according ly held to be ineffective. A third pre sented by residents of a small portion of the northeast corner of Carbon coun ! ty, bore the names of a large majority I of the taxpayers, and that territory j was eliminated from the proposed new , county. j A convention will soon be held to nominate officers for the county, which will be formed from parts of , Sweet Grass Carbon and Yellowstone. Columbus will be the county seat. It : iq believed that the question will car ry. 

OPERA REVIVAL THE I FASHION OF THE HOUR The opening of the present season ! brings to our attention that we are a I music loving people. Today America ! is showing an increased appreciation jof the comic operas of thirty years ago, and that there is no doubt of the successful issue of an extensive re ! vival of old operas has been proven by such stars as De Wolf Hopper. Eugene I Cowles and Arthur Cunningham, j Nothing is more to be desired than : a return of these beautiful master | pieces, reminiscent of days of ro : mance and poetry. They remind the hearer of the joys of the past and of his loss in now seeing them so seldom. The desire for novelty has led the public, thus far, away from the operas of the past. This same desire is lead ing them back; thus does the Whirli gig of Time bring its revenge. New productions do not satisfy the finer emotions of the present generation. "The play-going and music-loving population of today owes a debt of gratitudue to the producing managers who have discrimination and nerve enough to go to cedar chests for material admitting the short comings of contemporary authors and compos ers," comments a well known critic. The Beggar Prince Opera, with its wealth of melody, bright, gay and catchy, is an instance of this revival 'process. The management of the Star Theatre Is particularly fortunate in securing this attraction for one night. The cast is made up of well known artists, who have been selected on account of their peculiar fitness for the parts, and a most satisfying per formance is assured. This opera will be presented at the Star December 17. Products Grown in Musselshell County on Display in the Office of the Mon tana Land $ In vestment Company.

Musselshell Advocate: Work on the bridge which is to be built at this point was begun in earnest on Mon day and the forms are already complet ed for the concrete abutment on the north side and work is going rapidly ahead getting the forms in place for the south abutment.

The new bridge will have what is known as a "slab concrete floor.'' ! When first informed that the bridge, would have a concrete floor we were rather skeptical as to the practicability of such a roadway, but in convesation with Superintendent Roscoe he ex plained to us that the concrete would be covered by four or five inches of gravelandgumbo. There are drain plugs thru the concrete, and Mr. Ros coe says that after being used for about a month this floor will become as hard as a macadamised road and, will drain perfectly and makes the best roadway that has ever been found, While the cost of construction of such a floor is considerable more than the cost of a plank floor, it ts practically everlasting.

PRAY AT WORK ON DESERT ACT Question of Rights of Entrymen Be fore Secretary Fisher. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Represent ât! vc Bray has taken up with the Inter-, lor department the question of rights of entrymen who initiated entries un der the desert land act three and four; years ago and are now planning to; make final proof and whose rights are thought to be jeopardized by reason; of the fact that the lands adjoining those they entered have been taken 14 p subsequently under the homestead act and are being cultivated. There are many such entries now pending la Mcntsna, and fear prevails among the desert land entryn.* n that the depart ment intends to held their entries for cancellation nr; 11 . e ground that their lands are not of desert character, e'.p.ce the adjoining lands are being cultivât ed and produce crops. Mr. Pray contends that inasmuch as the lands were believed to be desert, filings were made and, inasmuch the department accepted payments and filings under the desert law, it cannot cancel entries where entrymen have shown full compliance with the desert and act. The secretary of the interior has not yet rendered a decision on this question, but Mr. Pray is anxious to present the side of the desert entry men before a precedent is established. Seymour Todd, one of the prosper ous business men of Twodot, was in the city Wednesday.
