Anarchy Rules Supreme in Bal tic Provinces. Koenigsburg, East Prussia, Dec. 5. Upon information gain ed from Russian fugitives it is stated here that anarchy prevails in the Rusian Baltic provinces. The government has whollv lost o I - . .. t i.ir -. us power ana me soiuiers are oe ginnig to fraternize with the rev olutionists. One frequently sees drunken soldiers parading the streets with socialists waving red handkerchiefs.- ? The ferment among the sailors , at Libau continues. The peas antry declared the clergy and of ficials deposed and are installing new local officials. They also prevent the estate .owners from selling grain or wood, declaring that the forests are communal property. Ihe protection of life and property has wholly ceased to exist. Bands of criminals are scouring the provinces and num erous seats of estate owners have been pillaged, their arms,, horses, v-and money have been seized and tneir cattle Durnea to aeatn in the stables. The stream of fugitives cross ing the frontier is daily increas ing. Noblemen from the Baltic provinces are arrriving at Koen igsberg to place their women and children in safety. St. Petersburg, Dec. 5. Al though there appears to be no (foundation for the prevailing fears that an outbreak is immi nent, the population continues in a state of anxious suspense.

One ,K of the conspirators, it is said, be- i trayed his fellows, whereupon vi the leaders, knowing that their j attack could be repulsed by the 3 troops with great slaughter, ?; j abandoned it. The existence of (t j this conspiracy led to a report that martial law would be pro claimed, but this is authoritative ' ',' rly denied, j The extension of the strike of the telegraphers to the postal : system is complete and the par alysis of business is increasing Uhe danger of financial crisis. The strike of the Moscow telephone operators, who cut the wires and! - tore up the poles, has severed the last means of communication S with the ancient capital. The present conditions are un oearable. Sympathy with the ; poorly paid post and telegraph employes is now turning into in- Agnation against the strikers And the public is supporting a , formidable movement which has 4 been started by all classes to hrow off the voke of the revolu ionaries. ( Stockholm, Dec. 6. The Af jonbladet savs that two war ves els will be dispatched to St. Pet ersburg to protect the Swedes ler and to bring home those rho wish to return.

Ac cording to Secretary Wilson the farmers trust, which is not a close corporation, produced $G, 415,0C0,C00 worth of crops during the year. That is enough to make the greatest octopus sit up and take notice. Thus the American farmer be comes the wonder of the world. He has turned all his fields to gold, as it were. The secretary of agriculture, with fine pictorial fancv, savs: "The man with the hoe has become the man with the harvester and the depositor and shareholder of the bank.'' So much for totals and the re port of Secretary Wlison. Now to consider the farmer as one of us, as an individual. Of course he is prosperous, but these are prosperous times. The man who tills the soil is not one but many, and the many are not becoming leaders in finance with that ra pidity which the secretary in his fine figure suggests. After the totals, which reach into billions, have been put through a shrink ing process we find the farmer well-to-do, but not becoming im mensely wealthy. Mortgages in large number have been lifted nd some money accumulated, but he is working from c rly dawn till nightfall and only do ing well. Therefore, while totals ilmost stagger, the man who fol lows the plow is not accumulat ing riches untold. He is simply one of us and enjoying to full measure the prosperity with which this country is favored. To detract in any way from the record made by the farmer during the year is not desired. But it is well to consider things in their true light, and some times figures startle when there is no need. The farmer is just doing his best and. favored by weather conditions, his best tells that is all. South Bend Tribune. One Needed Lesson. The conviction of Senator Bur ton of Kansas before a United States court in St. Louis is worth more to the moral health of-the community than would be all the denunciations of graft that a thousand orators at o0 cents per admission ticket could fulmin ate or a thousand reformers, edi tors and clergymen could preach in a decade. There has never been a time when we were without the ora tio or the sermon of this signif icance. The dishonest and the indifferent continued to pay this homage of respect for the theo ries and principles of honesty. Even if the respect was only pre tended it was still homage, be cause it revealed the hypocrites' belief that honesty deserves re spect. Though all could talk this way, we failed to practice what we preached. Senator Burton's case reenfor ces that of Senator Mitchell of Oregon and other events also in demonstrating that the public conscience has only been dozing and that it regards all those forms of dishonestv that are grouped undar the name of graft as dishonest in as true a sense as picking pockets, and when pun ishment is asked for proved of fenses it will be administered without respect of persons or sta tion. This is what the community needs. It must be made to feel that society means by its laws against certain acts to condemn them and will punish them when proved. Chicago Chronicle. Howard Turner. Howard Turner son of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson Turner of Walkerton, died Wednesday night after an illness, of three weeks. He was thirteen years old and was a brignt and promising boy. Mr. and Mrs. Turner were residents of Plymouth several years and the sympathy of many friends goes out to them in their deep affliction.

A Brilliant Masonic Function. Mr. and Mrs. C. O. Tribbey gave a progressive dinner Mon day evening to the resident mem bers of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish "Kite and their wives. The dinner was elaborate, served in four courses, the brethren 'moving up one table at the com pletion of each course.

Oscar Tribbey, Charles S. Cleveland, Daniel McDonald, James W. Thayer. A Satisfactory Message. President Roosevelt's annual message to congress, which was read in both houses Tuesday, was in some respects the most satisfactory document that has issued from the white house since Mr. Roosevelt became president. It contained no new topics of leg islation and its tone from begin ning to end was an admixture of fine conservatism and ardent pat riotism. It "was received bv senators and representatives with feelings of satisfaction that they did not attempt" to restrain. Their ver dict was that the president had made himself so clear and com prehensive upon all of the great subjects of legislation which will engage the attention of congress during the next six or seven months that there is a greater likelihood than ever before of united and harmonious action in both houses. The condensed re port of the message giving. all its main points is given in our paper and should be carefully read by all who wish to understand the questions which will be consid ered by congress which convened Monday. Indiana Railway Accidents. Figures compiled by Joseph H. Stubbs, chief of the state bureau of statistics, show that during the year ended June 30, 1905, 354 persons lost their lives by acci dent on railroad trains in Indi ana and 3,809 people were in jured. Of the eighty-nine killed through causes classed as being beyond their control, five were passengers, fifty-seven were em ployes and twenty-seven were neither. Of the 265 classed as having been killed through their own carelessness, three were passen gers, fifty-five were employes and 207 were . neither. Of the total number injured, 1,782 were in jured through causes beyond their control, of which number, 158 were passengers; 1,561 em ployes, and sixty-three others. Of the 2,027 injured through their own carelessness, sixty -three were passengers, 1,728 employes, and 236 others. Damages to the amount of $37,548.93 were paid by the companies during that year.

RUSSIAN REVOLUTION. Battle Fought with Mutineers at Kieff in Which Fifty Men are Slain. There has been serious street fighting at Kieff between mutin ous sappers and Cossacks and between workmen and bands of the "black hundred." Scores of persons have been killed or wounded. Martial law has been proclaimed. Officers recently held a meet ing at Tsarskoe-Selo and decided to refuse to order their men to fire if called on to repress dis orders. intense alarm prevails at' St. Petersburg. Communication with the outer world by telegraph ceased when the Finnish operat ors joined their Russian com rades. The embassies, legations and banks are hastily organizing courier service to both the Fin nish and German frontiers. The population is almost in a state of panic, fearing that the raliroads will stop running and that the , inhabitants therefore will have no mode of flight in the event of the cataclysm which th:y seem to fear is imminent. There is the greatest excite ment among the sailors and the authorities have ordered the dis armament of the warships. The officers, fearing a mutiny, acced ed to the demand of the sailors for the release of a workman who was arrested while disturbing revolutionary proclamations. Soldiers and sailors are driving about the streets creating distur bances. Many quarters of the city are dangerous after nightfall, owing to an increase in the num ber of unruly characters. The military authorities are preparing repressive measures. Heavy forces of artillery are ar riving at the capital, causing a panic among the population. The most elaborate precau tions have been taken against, a feared outbreak by the troops as a result -of the Sebastopol mut iny. The naval battalions have been completely gained over by the revolutionists and are almost beyond control. They have been deprived of their arms." Thereactionary influences' at court and the imperial guard are making desperate efforts to un horse Count Witte, t√∂ proclaim a dictatorship and to fight the revolution with bullets and b√§v onets. Their candidates for dic tator are General Count Alexis Ignatieff and General Skallon, governor general of Poland. Stories of the spread of disaf fection in the guard regiment are in evervbodv's mouth and the revolutionaries continue to boast that the troops will no longer fire on the people. Circuit Court News. Circuit Court adjourned Wed nesday of last week until Mon day afternoon. The court this week has been trying the case of the state ver sus Lillie Clark, charged with burglary. Jesse Lucas, who en tered a plea of guilty at last term of court, was brought down from Michigan City and testified that the defendant accompanied him to the home of Joseph Woods, where he stole the goods and to gether they returned with the stolen property to Bourbon, where they and -Robert Clark were arested. Martindale & Stevens are at torneys for the defense and R. M. Washburn of Bourbon, as sisted Judge Hess in the prose cution. The case went to the jury late Wednesday and we are not able to give the verdict. . Many people believe that the state did not make a case strong enough to convict a woman. The trial of Robert Clark, charged wiht receiving the stolen goods, will follow this trial. Klingerman Thompson Nuptials. Mr. Otto B. Klingerman and Miss Harriet M. Thompson were married at the Presbyterian manse in Flymouth, Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 29, by Rev. Geo. A. Pflug. Mr. Klingerman is employed by Mr. Yarrick in the plumbing business and is a steady, indus trious young man. His bride is the popular daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clark Thompson of this city. Both have many friends who will join with the Tribune in wishing them a long and happy married life. Marriage Licenses. Harriet Lauer and, Julius W. Deutsch, Benjamin N. Ecker and Myrtle J. Crites, James S. Per sonett and Philena Matteson. Ttt' Tribuns ;i.C3 prr yzzx. Those 225,000 Votes. It must have been with some thought of the 225,000 votes .st for William R. Hearst that May or McClellan at the great Jew ish celebration in Carnegie Hall said : "Can we blame a man if upon the first taste for freedom he con founds license with liberty; can we blame him if, upon his first glimpse of freedom, he is inclined to follow the teachings of the first demagogue who preaches anarchy and who promises Uto pia at the expense of existing law and order. Hunger and ignor ance cover a multitude of sins." But the 225,0C0 votes cast for Hearst were not only the votes of those who "with the first taste of freedom have been inclined to follow the teachings of the dema gogue who preaches anarchy and who promises Utopia at the ex pense of the existing law and or der." The votes represented these, indeed, but they also represented thousands who' preferred even the demagogue preaching anar chy and promising Utopia, to the triumph of a boss whose loftiest conception of municipal govern ment was that of "honest graft" and anything else that promised a rake-off but didn't monkey with the penal code. They also represented the discontent and disgust that have followed the insurance scandals. Wall Street Journal. Creatore's Wife Still After Him. Mrs. Anna Creatore, wife of the great Italian band master, who delighted thousands at Win ona Lake summer before last, has a suit for divorce pending against him in Xcw York and when questioned about it the great mu sician says: "Yes, ft is true that I left my wife in 1901." He is not animated in private life as he was in his musical rehersals at Winona. "But I provided for her, I send her monev, or mv secretarv in New Yoik does; sometimes $25, sometimes $10, sometimes $5 a week, and occasior !ly a new dress or a new hat, or something of that sort. She says my in come is $25,000 a yes.r. Oh, well. I married my wife nine years ago in Naples. There was no ro mance. We just met and mar ried. I soon discovered that I had made a mistake. Her soul did not respond to my soul. She cares nothing for music, in which and by which I live. A reconcil iation would be discord. She jars on me, I shall not contest the suit if she savs only that I left her." " Experiments in Feeding. Prof. J. H. VanNorman, of the Purdue agricultural department, who will have charge of the ex periments in cattle feeding, to be conducted at the university, this winter, in accordance with the act of the last legislature, provid ing $5,000 for the purpose, has sent out blank forms to every county clerk in the State, asking them to obtain a list of the n√§mes of persons raising cattle to any extent. When these lists are compiled he will write to the lar ger raisers in each county and in vite them to send cattle upon which toexperiment. The "cattle feeding tests will all be conduct ed at the new at the new Purdue barns and they will be the most complete ever undertaken in any school in the country. Commissioners' Court. The Commissioners met in regular session Monday morning. The usual routine business was transacted. On the last day of the session Daniel Jacoby was ' appointed drainage comisioner, Dr. Eley re signed as physician for county infirmary and was made secre tary of the board of health. Dr. A. C. Holtzendorff was made county asylum physician." There was a lively discussion in regard to appointing a tax fer ret, but the board voted two for and one against the resolution, consequently it is probable that a man to look up unpaid taxes will be appointed. Wanted to Keep Parker. Jesse Parker, a South , Bend colored man who was taken to the Longcliff hospital for4the in sane in Logansport last summer, was returned to South' Bend Thursday by Sheriff Sch√§fer. Parker has apparently entirely recovered from his dementia. While at Longcliff he worked' in the dining room and cared for 20 rooms. Superintendent Rogers said that he did not like to see the South .Bender leave the insti tution, but Parker was willing. Crumpacker Favors Hanly. Louis Ludlow wires from Washington to the Indianapolis Star: Judge Edgar D. Crumpacker, representative from the Tenth district, who arrived here Satur day, predicts that Governor Han ly will develop into a very prom ising possibility for the Republi can presidential nomination in 1908. The character of Mr. Han ly 's administration from the start has been such, he says, as to at tract the attention of the whole country. To a group at the Wil lard hotel Judge Crumpacker said that Mr. Hanly 's star is traveling in the. direction of the presidency instead of the senate. "We are for Hanly for presi dent up our way," said the judge. "If it shall turn out that both Mr. Fairbanks and Mr. Hanly are candidates for the presidential nomination the Tenth district will be for Mr. Hanly." Mark Twain's Birthday. Mark Twain was 70 years old on Thanksgiving day. This re calls what the Chicago Journal said of the longevity of authors. We reproduce it as it was printed last spring. "Dr. Holmes attained the age of eighty-five; Whittier and Harriet Beecher Stowe died at eighty-four; Bryant at eighty three; Emerson at seventy-eight; Irving at seventy-six ; Longfel low at seventy-five. Of others still living and with one or two exceptions actively at work. Jul ia ' Ward Howe will be eighty six in May; Edward Everett Hale is eighty-three; Moncure Conwav is seventy-two; William Dean Howells will be sixty-eight in March. Holmes and Whittier both did some of their best work after they were seventy-five. Horns on Human SkulL A special from Knightstown, Ind., says: Alonzo Lewis, who lives near Sulphur Springs, in this county, has unearthed the skeleton of what is believed to be a primitive man belonging to a race that inhabited this section before history began to be writ ten. The skeleton is over seven feet long and a feature is that the skull measures ten inches to the back oi the head. On the back of the skull, just behind the ears, are horns about an inch and a half long, and turning down. Other similar skeletons have been unearthed in that neighbor hood. They have all been found in a gravel pit, about ten feet be low the surface. "Hello Girl" Braves Fire. Fire in the supply room of the An derson Telephone Company at a late hour Monday night caused a small d√§mage. It is not known how the fire originated. Miss Jennie McGell. who has charge of the exchange at night, stuck to her post although the building was filled with smoke and it was not until the flames began to creep toward her desk that she con sented to leave and be carried out by a fireman. When the blaze was fin ally extinguished she returned to her work and stayed during the night. New Cases Filed. Charles S. Brown vs Alice Brown for divorce. Petition of John S. Bender and Rachel Bender for the adoption of Elizabeth Martin. Ditch petition of William Lei ty and others'. Louisa A. Cappell vs Annie Morris and Howard Morris. Complaint to foreclose mortgage. Charley Tibbetts Dead. In answer to several inquiries made as to the death of Charles B. Tibbetts, the well known Ply mouth attorney who went from here to California and later to Ballard, Washington, we will state that we have been informed that Mr. Tibbetts died of con sumption at Ballard, November 2. He left a wife and one child. More Premiums for Corn. Since publishing list of prem iums for the corn show at the Farmers' Institute, Dec. 26 and 27, The Plymouth State Bank adds $5.00 in cash to the county premiums, L. Linkenhelt gives $2.00 and George Lender adds $3.00 to the premiums of Center township. Ffcll Sixty Feet and Lives. Fred Tjulande the Swede, who fell CO feet from the top of the new gas holder being built at Wabash by the Wabash Vallev Gas Co., last Monday, not ordv survives, but will recover. He is covered with bruises. The sur geons say the case is almost without precedent.
