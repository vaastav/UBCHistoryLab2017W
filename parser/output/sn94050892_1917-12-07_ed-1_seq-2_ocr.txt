President Wilson's 1 last message to con gress is, beyond doubt, his greatest state pa per. It is the greatest because it comes at just the right time with a straight from the shoulder blow. It is greatest because it will do more good to the alped cause than any other one thing short M a victory in the field. It is greatest because o its effect up on Germany and the njeutrals. It is greatest because of its courage and its firmness and its practical aims. g He not only asiJ5 ior war upon ausina, but aS&i. it in such a manner as to maKe Aus tria tremble. He not only strikes at Germ any's web of peace propaganda, but he asks for power to sternly repress the Hun's acti Tities over here. . The test of the greatness of this message .will lie in its effect upon the civilians of all the nations making war upon Germany. It will strengthen them and inspire them and weld them closer together. The president, in his message, publicly pledges his word that every human effort pos sible will be made by this country to beat the Hun to his knees. That was the word the country wanted. And that France and England wanted, too. The mistakes and delays and miscalcula tions and controversies' and inefficiency of the governmental machinery will be forgiven if only the nation is assured that the right spirit is behind it all. If it is these mistakes will be corrected and lagging feet will be spurred forward and incompetents relegated to the rear. The president's message is a light ed lamp in the house that is overshadowed by the clouds of war. . A 

PRAYER FROM THE FIELD. God grant that "in the bitter strife Which all must face who linger here, Upon the battered Field of Life, Or with the laurel swinging near Along the world's red firing line The battle of the strong and weak The fateof all the Fates be mine I will not show, the Yellow Streak. If fortune play- me false 6r fair jf from the shadowland I creep Or up the heights and linger there Or topple downward to the deep Or up the rugged path of Fame When one man fails another mounts God grant that I play out the game For there is nothing else that counts. Grantland Rice. WHAT THE RED CROSS DOES. Without slighting its vast peace work, the Red Cross has collected $85,000,000 of its $100,000,000 War Fmid. -25,000,000 from New York alone, and has' appropriated $40,000,000 by spring it will need more money. The Red Cross is olten accused of being a trust. To avoid duplication and banish waste it should be a trust ; it is costing lss than 1 per cent, to handle its War Fund. a welcome contrast, to a war bazaar that ost 09 per cent. Often it is aeeusd of martinet strictness in accepting work or services: and it should be strict. The Red Cross is world-wide in outlook. It works in Russia, Roumania. Serbia, as well as in Helgium and France. It hurried to the relief o fthe Italian retreat. It met the sur vivors of the Antilles at "the pier. It com mands the services of devoted men and wo .men, often without salary. It counts upon no less than $36,300,000 within a year of value equivalent in work to be done and ser vices rendered. The yearly report of these immense ac tivities is a record of which Americans can be proud, especially Americans who by work or money or both have shared in it. The number who are to share should keep step in growth with the pitiable, inevitable, im measurable need. Who will "adopt" a soldier boy from Greenlee County? Send him a. Christmas, greeting. Let him know he is remembered by the folks at home. The Red Cross Infor mation Committee will supply you thenani; and address. THE PRUSSIAN DANIEL BOONE When Daniel Hoone was fighting Indians he simply imagined what he would do if he were in the enemy's place, and then proceed ed to foil that move. It worked with wonder ful success, because Daniel had a good imagi nation and understood Indians. Germany continually uses the same meth ods in dealing with her enemies.' In military matters it often works, because modern tac tics are pretty much the same everywhere. In diplomacy and other matters depending on national and racial psychology Germany near ly always fails, because she lacks Daniel Boone's imagination. She tries to put herself in the other na tion's place, and goes wrong because she can't do it. Her conclusions are purely German. The other nation doesn't think in the German way at all, and so figures things out quite differently. All of Germany's relations with America since the war began have served to illustrate this fact. She has always been logical, but it has always been Prussian logic. She has assumed that Americans were guided by the . same motives as Germans, and could be hand led in the same way. She still persists in that delusion, despite the failure of all her propaganda and diplomacy. At present the German government is en gaged in another error of the same sort. The German people, and Europe m generally, are being warned against "the American menace." They are informed that the United States has entered the war from lust of money and k power that our object is to reduce Europe to vassalage, and thereafter dominate and ex ploit a helpless world. , Here is Germany once more attributing her own motives to us. To the Prussian mind it's as clear as day, because Prussia in our place would be aiming at that very thing. Unfortunately for German logic, it "ain't so." But we almost despair of that fact ever per colating through Prussi.m skulls. The Globe miners union is complaining again to Secretary of Labor Wilson because the mining companies in the Globe-Miami dis trict refuse to employ many of the foreigners yet remaining in that district, who were among the strikers last summer. The. loyalty league of the district, it seems, is keeping tab on-the disloyal trouble makers and comes in for denunciation for its anxiety. We have been led to believe that an administrator had been , left in the Globe-Miami district by the presi dent's labor' commission who was to decide any differences arising bet. ween the miners' and their employer. Federal reserve banks are urging the people of this country to use as many Liberty bonds as possible during the approaching holidays for Christmas presents, urging that the habit of giving money as presents be aban doned as the government needs the money. We trust this adviee will be followed and that those friends of the Copper Era who have heretofore sent a box of cigars on Christmas will this year send a Liberty bond. Can you imagine the feelings of La Fol lette and Gore when President Wilson deliver ed his classic war message to congress? The fact that two United Slates Senators refused to stand when every other member of the two houses rose and gave the president an ovation is unbelievable. Dissenters in congress on such inn Iters should not be tolerated. Arizona, it is announced, made a better showing lhan any other state in the recent Y. Al. ('. A. war fund drive, scoring 110 per cent over the amount of her quota. The average for the nation was only 46 per cent over the national' quota. The word "only" is not used in the preceding sentence as term of reproach but in e.nnlrast with what Ari zona did. While the authorities should be verv toierant of American Socialists, many of whom do not know why they i.re Socialists, the self proclaimed UoMieiki in New York ought to be closely watched. Their great leader in Petrograd is known to be in the service of the enemy. People who always loow for slogans and must have slogans should give ear to Gen eral Pershing, commanding the United States forces in France: "There is no ground for the heresy that Germany cannot be beaten. Germany can be beaten. Germany must be beaten. Germany will be beaten." Propaganda and pacifism say to the con trary, but the man on the job ought to have a hearirfg. With the country at war and industry strained to the cracking point, there are still men who get up six-day bicycle "races." Still, we may as well lake it philosophically. if-. WHY WE ARE
