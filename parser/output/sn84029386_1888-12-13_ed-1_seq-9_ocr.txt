-SCOFFING AT" MARRIAGE. A Sensible Article on Oneoftbe Burning Questions of the Day. The unseemly discussion which a a certain class of newspapers have been making' a conspicuous feature in their columns of late of the question, "Is marriage a failure?" is simply a fresh breaking' out of the old and nau seous social malady of "free love." It is amazing that any editor who has either any regard for the reputability of his journal or any respect for the welfare of society should countenance the dis cussion of so grave a theme in the reckless and flippant style and manner in which it is treated by the class of shallow and inconoclastic writers who, in their anxiety to air their immoral sophistications, delight to exhibit their contempt for those things and institu tions which reasonable and good men deem too sacred to be assailable. The man or woman who seriously asks the question "Is marriage a fail ure?" is obviously disqualified, by a lack of either virtuous or proper ex perience, or of intelligent or thought ful conviction, from answering or even discussing the question at all, the very asking of it being almost proof posi tive that the one asking it is of the affirmative way of thinking, and that he or she is of that way of thinking because of experiences, observations or theories that are at least superficial, but more probably the resultants of the individual folly or viciousness of a depraved nature. A married life that has proved a failure because the parties to the contract have had neither sense enough, mutual forbearance enough nor morality enough to be faithful to its obligations is not a just sample of the marital institution, is not a fair illustration of modern domesticity, is not an exponent of the aver age family condition of civilized society. It is exceptional and aDnormal. A true man and a true woman, entering into tho relations of man and wife with rational delibera tion, with genuine affection, and with high and pure motives, do not find marriage a failure. They know what they are about before they enter into the intimate and sacred partnership. It is on their part not a matter of im pulse, of emotion, of money, nor of passion, but of mutual and reciprocal affection, guided and consummated by the dictates of reason and of a thought ful anticipation of all the possibilities and all the contingencies that are in volved in the solemn compact. Such matches are made in heaven, are heav enly in their lifelong continuance, and extend beyond this life into heaven itself. Marriage is a failure only when the man or the woman is a failure in his manhood or in her womanhood. It is never a failure when the man and the woman are true to themselves an'd to each other. It is never a failure where the feeling and the motive and the purpose are right. It is never a fail ure where true love and honor are the links of unity. It is never a failure where good sense and good principle lead to and control the relationship. It is very rarely a failure, in any event, where children are its fruitage and the family altar is the center of its daily sanctification. Those who sneer and mock at mar riage are not God's people; they are not of those who are the best develop ment of modern civilization; they are not illustrations either of social mor ality or of sound sense. They are the froth and scum that float and bubble upon the surface of social life. They are people of unbridled passions, sen sual and selfish instincts or shallow minds. They are not the many, but the wild and reckless few. As a rule, marriage is not a failure, but quite the reverse. "When it proves a failure, it is an exception to the rule, just as idiots, cranks, lunatics and moral lep ers are exceptional developments of human evolution. Chicago Journal. A New Fire Quickener. The servant girl who pours kerosene oil on the fire, seems to have disap peared pretty completely. Perhaps she has been to a considerable extent ex terminated. At any rate we don't often read of cases of explosion and con flagration, though the vigilant house keeper, if she happens into the kitchen may still detect an odor which tells her that the girl must have poured oil on the kindling either before or after it was ignited. .But the Listener has a case which may explain why kerosene accidents are not so frequent. The servant girl has discovered a new fire quickener. It was in Boston, and not long ago, that the mistress of a house, not much given to going into the kitchen, entered one day, unexpectedly, just in time to catch her kitchen maid in the act of emptying a spoonful of granulated white sugar into the fire. Sugar is exceedingly inflammable, and its application made the fire flash up in excellent shape. The head of the house had noticed that he was called upon to pay for a' great many barrels of sugar, and his wife had wondered at the family's enormous consumption of that article, but she did not wonder any more, especially as the girl, under pressure, confessed that she had regu larly been using the sugar to quicken the fire. "Sure, mum," she said, "we must havo the fire, an' the coal burns that slow that me heart is broke waitin' on it" Boston Transcript. m Two Pictures from Life. Women havo resources; they must have them. They can spend hours alone and enjoy themselves. I wonder how? Do they dream? Women never seem to lose their fancy, and there seems no age at which they can not call their sentiments to their aid. But women hare interests in the world that men. no matter how good, never have. "My little boy is quite sick," the father says to his friend as he meets him, "and I am quite alarmed about bim." The mother says but little, but she is by the bedside holding on to that little life with all her might No thought is hers but to bring her darling- back to health; her soul is all in the sick little one, and her eyes are tearless with, tho effort to save him. The father feels, but the mother suffers. San Francisco Chroniclz. PRIVATE-HObWITALS: - Tho Latest Freak for Wealthy Patients and Sclceatifio Explorations.

One room is set apart for tho use of the doctor's assistants, usually young medi cal graduates who are glad to give their time for their living and tho ex perience obtained. The most import ant part of the establishment is the patient, who must of course have plenty of money, and may be male or female. The complaints of both sexes are treated, though not usually in the same house And these surgical re treats offer the inducement of perfect privacy to all their patrons, which is one secret of their success. As may be surmised from what has been said, many of the patients are people of means who do not wish their friends to know of their illness, and who have strong- reasons for secrecy. The first private hospital started in this city was that of a wefl-known gynecologist and obstetrican. In this es tablishment the diseases of women are exclusively treated, and the cost to each patient is about $1,000 a month. There are often thirty or forty in mates, seldom less than ten or fifteen. So it will be seen this first venture was a success. If all the private hospitals for the treatment of women were of the same order, it would be a matter for public congratulation, but of the hundreds that have been opened by many doctors of doubtful schools of characters the majority are not above suspicion. Some of these private af fairs are really the laboratories of human vivisectionists. More than one famous surgeon who has a hospital at his command sends the best of the hos pital's cases to his own establishment, where he can experiment undeterred by the supervision of human lay-trustees and other hospital officers. A certain surgeon desired to obtain a large number of cases of abdominal section, a few years ago, and resolved to perform laparotomy whenever he could obtain a patient on whom there was the smallest excuse for this, the most difficult and deadly of all oper ations. He was one of the surgeons-in-chief of one of our largest hospitals, and proceeded to operate on the insti tution's charity patients on the slight est provocation. Before long the num ber of deaths from abdominal section in the hospital engaged the attention of the trustees, and tho surgeon was summoned privately, of course be-J fore the board. After a long hearing they failed to agree as to whether or not he had abused his powers; but they agreed to forbid him in future to per form a capital operation without all the surgeons of the hospital concurred and were present He had not yet obtained the scientific data that he desired, so resorted to the private hospital idea. Ho purchased a large house on Thirty-fourth 3treet and fitted it up for a private hos pital. Here he could, untrammeled, aut up his victims and obtain his sci entific data. Here he sent all patients whom he could feel justified in operat ing on. Here he has slain his hundreds, and will slay his thousands before he gets done; then be will publish a book on abdominal surgery that will make him famous. As he is a wealthy man and can spend any amount of money to attain his ends, and works strictly within tho letter of the law, nothing can stop him in his death-dealing ca reer. This is but one instance. There are many others. It is in these laborato ries of science that most of the surgi cal sensations that appear in the public press originate. There is one advantage gained by them, however: that is they are the best possible schools for the advance ment of surgical science. "Talk about cutting up dogs and cats! Why, we cut up men the worthiest animal for vivisection!" Such were the words, perhaps over enthusiastic, which the writer heard one of these students of anatomy utter. N. T. Cor.
