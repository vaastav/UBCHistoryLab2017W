Chicago Srifcune. SATIatPAY, DECEMBER 15, 1800. MONETARY. Friday Evening. Dee. H, 1860. Nothing has occurred in financial matters to-day to vary the ttercolyju d dullness Uiat has prevailed fur the past week. The banks confine their trans actions to receiving deposits, paying checks, bay. log what■ little straggling exchange makes Its aj>- pearanec. and distributing It among their easte rners. A good piece of business paper for db coon! would be regarded with almost wonder. Iu the meantime currency Is accumulating, and with present prospects the surplus i.: not toon likely to find employment. Oar city bankers are carrying an immense amount of It, and are, of course, losing the interest ou It. while the uttcrers of U expect to receive on the first of January, or ns soon as their bonds go up to o.i figures, their interest thclv investment, while the people arc paying 10 *1 ecu!. premium for Exchange. Let oar hanking Jaw be so amended that a few sharpers cannot make a very handsome income «u what they owe the public. Exchange, to-day, has been qotcr at former qu< - unions. Buying ; selling 10 ft cent, premi um. Customers, only, arc supplied. Outsider have lo pay $ cent, above current rales to customers. The European new*, published this morning, was decidedly favorable. It produced, however, no effect upon our money market here beyond ii • spiring a more cheerful feeling in financial clrchs and better hopes for the future. There Is. so far *a the new» would indicate, no panic in England in regard to American securities, and no danger that considerable quantities will he sent home for sale. Thegvrernl money market !• easy: probably Ii was never more ?o la the history of the city. FirM clas* pap'T could be placed at 10 cent. outside th-rb iaks. and 103-15 cent, is about the range for any that would passat all. There h scarcely any first-class paper offering.

The thousands of car riages, for one item. annually sold in our market, will b« dispensed with this vea-on, and tU« money h**reiofon* taken to Connecticut and New Jersey will be retained here for one season; in fact, there « U! be no money this season to follow the million? «’f dollars heretofore zone North; hi with clothing and other goods of Northern maimfacliirc. In fine, there are -tiiliclent supplies of dry goods and gen s-.il mcrdnindlse in the South to last for two year?. It will require fully that length of time to sell out. til-poseur the Mocks now oh hand. This nl-o u pile* to the mllliiicn-. fancy retail trade and crino line trade in general. We notice from day to d.'.\ fresh receipt* of merchandise being received from the North and Europe. It may be well inquired how are tln***e fresh purchases to be cancelled Sr the war of payment? Though there will be a lun acy market tills cpriiig, there will be no long paper market. The t:«nnl advances on crops to be grown will be Immeasurablycnrtailcd and restricted. A? our prediction* of last summer, regarding large purchases for tills boaean’e trade, arc being dailv verified, wcagain repeat the caution to all our mer chant.-. dealers and traders, confineyonrordcn* fo; the spring fade to the verv lowest limits. In fait, we think there will be no t-pring trade this reawii. In the nsnal t*cn#c of the w urd. further than for tin actual necessaries of life. Prom thi* It would seem that the Southern peo ple are determined to pursuetbe same economic#' policy that has worked *o admirably forthclaM three year* iu relieving the Northwest from embar rassment. The more economy they practice (hi better, only so they cease blating about disunion, and the buslm-e of the country would soon adjust Itself and How on Iu its accustomed channels.

Anderson, commander at Fort Moul trie, fur more men and ammunition, and the action of the Cabinet thereupon. It is stated on authority which I think is not to be dis puted, that Maj. Auden-on has decided upon iho necessity for a reinforcement to his com mand and Ins supplies, because when the se cession ordinance is passed, there is no secu rity that n Charleston mot) will not make a desperate onslaught upon the nearest Federal possessions. The question of acceding to Maj. Anderson’* request has been up before the Cabinet uud it was decided not to grant it. Secretary Cass, it is slated, strongly asserts the propriety or the necessity of the opposite course. Either Maj. Anderson was justified in making requisition or not. If justilled, his request should be grouted at once. If not, then he is incompetent to till his place, and it should be supplied by some one who would not make a dangerous demand in troublesome times. So long tu> he is iu authority, the means of ?*■«,.-ting Lis authority should be conceded to him. in h]»itc of these arguments, which are tin* answerable, the Cabinet refused to send any more men or ammunition to Fort Moultrie, and thus the matter stands. [K. T. Tribune's Washington Correspondence.] It Ip intimated that Gen. Cas* will resign In consequence of the action ol (ho Cabinet. [K. Y. Herald’s Washington Correspondence.] At the request of lion. Reuben Davis of Mississippi, a member of the Committee of Stales, the Southern Members of Congress as sembled at his rooms to-night, and adjourned at 11 o’clock, at which the 'following declara tion was made and signed byjthose present. It li.lcl aircady been presented to the Committee o; Thirly-thrcc; THE EOUTHERN MANIFESTO. W itmxcro.N*, Dec. 13. To our Constituents: Tlie argument is ex hausted. All hope of relief ta the Union through the agency of the Committee and Congressional legislation or Constitutional amendments, is extinguished, and we trust the South will not be deceived by appearances or the pretense of new guarantees. The Repub licans arc resolute in their purpose to grant nothing that willorougbt to satisfy the South. In our judgment, the "honor,'safely and Inde pendence of the Southern people, arc to be iouud only in a Southern Confederacy—the In evitable result of Southern State secession— that the sole and primary aim of each slavc j.ulJing Slate ought to be its speedy and abso !»»••• t epamtion irom an unnatural and hostile Union.

Washing fox, Dec. 13.—A letter from a dis tinguished source just received from Alabama, says it is now certain that the co operatiouists or conservatives, will tarry every count}'ln Northern Alabama, in the election of delegates to the Convention, and ten or more in Middle or Southern Alabama, thus rendering doubtful the qv.wtbm as to which side will triumph in the convention. Col. Taylor, a leading Celt man of Alabama. Ins published a letter strongly favoring co operation. If, however, Iho ordinance of se cession be passed, the conservative* will insist that it he Mibmlttccl to the people for ratilica lion. Private accounts from Georgia slate that the conservative* under the lead of Stephens, Johnson, Jenl:in«, and others, arc in strong hopes of carrying a majority of the members of tin* Slate Convention, and that the concilia tory tone of the Republicans will ad much to slronglhen c*mservatlves. *• Notwithstanding tin* denial to the contrary, the President did receive a week ago the most distinct ami explicit assurance that South Car olina would wot resist the Federal authorities during his Administration.

Congress lias In secret session conferred ex traordinary powers upon President Castilla with reference to the present difficulties with Bolivia. It Is therefore thought by many that Castilla will not content himself by simply overthrowing Dellnaras, but will probably try to annex Bolivia to Pern. A letter trom *Llma says that Castilla Is to raise an army of 80,000 men to operate against Bolivia. The letter adds it is the general opinion of the people who know both the Bolivian and Peruvian armies that the funner will gain the victory in the coming struggle,at least if old Gen.

One of the busiest places In Chicago, next to onr large dry goods stores, is the center of operations of the “City Mission,” corner of Indiana and Franklin street- 5 . The church there is undergoing quite a cbangelntcmally In order to make room for dispensing relief to the bodies of the poor, as well os to preach the gospel to the souls of men. The gallery has been lowered so as to make a large basement, which Is to be divided olf into several apart* meuts for a sewing school for girls, teaching them to sew and make garments for them* selves; and judging by appearances, some of the little ones sadly need the flannels and other warm garments to protect them from the cold. Over these smiling, though not always tidy, faces, a bevy of Christian ladles arc flitting about, Instructing their sadly neglcctedpupils, and so mingling with them as to elevate them by kind words of advice and sympathy. Such sights the angels look upon with pleasure. up stairs is to be the Free Chapel and Son* day School, where the missionary preaches to adults Sunday mornings, and instructs and in* terests the children in the afternoon. A look* cr-on reports, among other things, an inter esting lecture- to children last Sunday, about Christmas (which is near at hand), according to Mr. Charles Dickens* gospel, as rcvcaled'in “ Christmas Chimes,*’ and persona ted by the old miser Scrooge and little Tiny Tim. He si>okc of the great preparations al* . ways made in England preceding Christmas— by the return of boys from school in coaches, laden with fowl and pheasant, and how the season runs for at least a whole week there, while we usually give hut one day to that prince of festivals. About eighty children and thirteen teachers are gathered there, in the Mission School, with a congregation quite large and respectable. Besides the Industrial School—it is proposed to fit up at once, a lodging room for wayfaring men, where a meal and a lodging can'be baa fora small sum, and this is one of the pro* posed plana for “ Systematic Charity.” Labor ing meu get out of employ in the country and towns and flock hither, supposing some thing can be done whereby they can gel a sup port for the winter. Many expend their last shilling to reach the city. 'The usual resource then is to coil at some house at nightfall, and , ask for means to get a supper and lodging. ; Who could reluse twenty-five cents bn such a plea, especially if the night is cold or stormy; The place of resort for such is one of the cheap saloons on Kluzie street, (where many an unfortunate has been drugged and his money fleeced from him,) and then one shil ling goes for drink, while the other pays for a bunk* for the night, for such sleep as"revelry and dancing will permit. Xow, if we had a co:tou factory in Chicago, or other mechanical operations, whereby chil dren, women and. meu of good Industrial habits could flud employ, there would not be a til he of the temptation to mendicancy which at present exists. We have blood and muscle here for the real prosperity of the city, lying Idle at least one-fourth of the whole year;*and which would make the fortune of a spirited capitalist The great object, then, is to ameli orate the condition of the honest pour, and to relieve excuses for street beggiug. Christian ladies, warmed with love to their unfortunate fellow creatures, have adopted the method above alluded to, to employ a portion of their timein personally doing good to the children, and in order to enlist the sympathies of others, have working Torn Fair and Fes tival, to maintain this good work, and which will come oil in four or five weeks, if others will help on the good work. The following ladies arc engaged as managers in the Indus trial School, to whom donations may be made for that pbject: Mra.P.Andcrfon, liUsltoyd. t Mrs. Nidi •!«. •• Dr. Allport, “ ilarkson, •• C.

Wanted—A Union Meeting lu Chicago, Editors Chicago Tribuue; I cor dwlly indorse the sentiments embraced in your article of this morning on the subjoe* of the financial junta in Its relation? to the jk* lilic.d panic. Before we can hope for the sem blance of commercial prosperity we must set tle the foundations of our governmental struc ture upon something solid and enduring— something which commands the public confi dence, and gives promise of stability and cer tainty to commercial pursuits. If Louisiana. Tennessee, and Arkansas take the Mississippi river away from us to-morrow, and if Califor nia is.pcrmittcd to secede at will, putting a high tariff on American goods and interfering with the export of gold—if our navigation laws arc to b« violently set at nought when overit pleases a State to resolve itself out of the Union—if a fort is to be built at the mouth of the Ohio, with guns fit command every steamboat, flat-boat or raft that takes advan tage of the downward current to find a market —if our citizens are required to procure passports whenever they stir front llicir homes, and to run the gauntlet cf custom house spies in any or all parts of the present Union—if the public credit is destroyed in the money markets oi the world and the government of the United Stales to become a hissing and a by-word among the natives—then I say we may bid farewell to peaceful and profitable commerce and makeup ourraiudstochronicbankruptcy. Panic will become our normal condition and hard times our regular diet. Let us have a Union Meeting; and when I say Union meeting, I mean it- Philadelphia has held a Meeting To Encourage Disunion. Let us hare a meeting of business men and citizens generally to uphold, strengthen and defend the Union against tiFiaults from what ever tjUiirter. I think the entire population of Chicago can meet on this platform: The Union first, and Compromise o/lerteards. lam no pol itician. I know not whether any compromise will avail, but I do know that the Union can be preserved, I know, further, that it must be preserved if we are not ready to sec the busi ness of tbe Northwest prostrated beyond the hope of possibility of recovery. Water Street. Chicago, Dec. 14,15G0. La<llc»* City TlUslon of tUo 31. E. Cburcb* Now Is tho time xvheu the poor of the cily ncetl to be remembered and cared for. Many have resolved not to assist applicants for aid without some guarantee that they arc not Im postors. Let all such either take the time to investigate these cases, or else refer them to some reliable agency and authorize that agency to draw on them for the relief needed. For instance: Mr. A. having resolved to distribute no more indiserimato cluuity, goes to tho City Missionary and arranges with him thus: “I have not time to examine into the merits of the multitude of professed snflerer* calling upon me each day. Such articles of clothing as I can spare I will send to your office. In addition to this, you may draw upon me for one, two, three, or live dollars, to meet the urgent demands of those whose cases you have carefully examined and know to be needy and worthy.” Suchanarrangement would bcanactual relief to the man of business, giro increased influ ence to the missionary in his efforts to Im prove the condition of the poor, and distribute much needed charities just where the donor would have them go—where they would cot be used in feeding vicious appetites, but In supplying real comforts to those who stand greatly in want of them. -Will not onr citizens, in view of the actual presence of drear, cold, winter, and pinching hard times, talcc this matter into considera tion? The Ladies* City Mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church has an office, In chanro of Itev. IV. F.
