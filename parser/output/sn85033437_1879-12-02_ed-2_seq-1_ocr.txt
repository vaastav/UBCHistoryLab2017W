Following I tyuoptU of Prenl tieut Hiyee' message, read la both nousee at the astembllng of tbe Forty Sixth Cod grew yesterday : Ha congratulates OongmM on tbe suc cessful execution of the Resumption tct. Tbe demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange fir United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in eiohange for notes has been very large. Tbe excess of the precious metals depos ited or exchanged lor United States notes over the amount of United States notes re deemed is about forty million dollars. He refers to the consequent revival of trade, and says the increasing foreign demand for our manufacturers' and agricultural pro ducts has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from tbe first of July list to November 15th, to the amount of $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie, payments there kaaaleo been a marked and gratifying im provement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government, bearing only four per cent, interest, have been sold at or above pat sufficient in amount to pay off all of ths National debt; Which was re deemable under present laws. Tbe amount of interest saved annually by this process of refunding the debt since March 1st, 1877, is $147,177 The bonds sold were largely in .auiall sums, and the number of our-citizens now holding tbe public securities h much greater than ever before. The amount of tbe National debt which matures within less than two years is $-,92,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears interest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing six per cent interest It is believed that this part of the public debt Can be refunded by the issue of four per cent: bonds, and by tbe reduction of interest which will thus bo effected, about eleven million dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest paid by tbe United States, fur ther legislation il lequired, which, it is hoped will be provided by Congress dur ing its present lession. The coinage of gold by the mints of tba United States dur ing tbe last fiscal year, was flO.WO.UIZ The coinage of silver dollars sicce the pas sage of the act for that purpose to Novem ber 1st, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,844 have - been issued from tbe Treasury and are now in circulation and $itt,300,606 are still in the pesseion of the Government. Tbe pending of tbe propo sition for a union of action between the United Slates and tbe principal commer cial nations of Surope, to the effect that a permanent System fur tbe equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend ttial Con gress refrain from new legislation on the general subject The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during tbe coming year, its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempt ing further experimental measures with the coinage. 1 would, howover, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of au thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the pre-enl lgal rates. Tho market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely Jlcss than tbe market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain tbem Ht par with each other, if both are coined without limit. It' the oeupnr coin is f rced into circulation it will, if corned without limit soon bocoraw the solo standard vlttfc and thus defeat! i j t i : i . , me aesirea oircfc, wnicn irourronoy 01 both gula ana silver, which Bhall be equivalent vilue, dollar for dollar, witb the universullv atcoEnized money of the world. ihe retirement lroru circulation of United State notes vitb the uapaoity of legallten dir in private cMijTacUls a Hop to be tir in our Droeress toward a safe and'iia currency, wbicb shall 1J be accepted! afe the policy and duty of tie Government aoiitbe interest and eecuritf ot ine peoulo. IV M m y firm conviction bat tha.-is.ue of legal tender paper nieney, baled f wholly upon the authority id cratiitifl tbeUovern ment, except in eAem(Jjifrgoncy, is without warrant in tli?Tt?Cntitulion, and a vi ilaiion of sound financial principle?. Tbe iscue of United States notes during the late civil war, witbthe capacity of le gal tende.r between Jbrivate individuals was not aiCol-ifead.fxcept as a means of rescuing tie esuhtv from imminent peril. The cUculuticnVtC these notes as paper money f'uran protracted period of time after he acWmplisbment of this purpose, was nt contemplated by tbe framera of the law under which they were issued. They anticipated tbe redemption and withdrawal Af thieaA nntpa at LhA AarliAfit nracticAble berioi. Consistent with the aVtainment of the object for which they were provided, tbe .policy of the United states, steadily ad- IVViivj vi tua u mien, owtas, sirmuy - loured to from tba adootion of tbe Uonsti tution, has been to avoid the creation of a National debt, and wben trom necessity in the time of war debts have been crea ted, they have been paid offon the return of peace as rapidly as possible. , With this iew and for this purpose, It is recom mended that tbe existing laws for the ac cumulation of a sinking fund .sufficient to extinguish tbe-public debt within a limited peroid be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has sbown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance tbe price of these articles to tbe consumer and which will add several millions of dollars annually to tbe Treasury. On the subject -ct polygamy tbe Presi dent ssys: .. Utah has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general interests of tbe Na tion, as well as the welfare of the citizens of tbe Territory, require its advance from the territorial form of government to tbe re sponsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change, however, will not be approved by the country, while the citizens of Utah, in a very considerable number, uphold a practice which is con, demed as a orime by the laws of all civil ized communities throughout the world. He mentions that the law for the suppres sion of polygamy has now been decided by tbe Supreme Court as to be within the leg islative power of Congress, and binding, as a ru'e of action for nil who rciide witbin the Territories. There is no longer any reason- for delay or hesi tation : in its- enforcement. It should be firmly and effectually exe cuted. If not sufficiently strong in i s pro visions it should be amended, and in aid of tbe purpose In view I recommend ; hat more comprehensive and mors search ing methods for preventing as woll as pun ishing this crime be provided. If nec essary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exerciso of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the territories of the United Suites maybe withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or op pose tbe enforcement of the law on this subject. Tbe elections of the vast year. though occupied only with State officers, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which have attended them all over tho oountry, new and decisive evi dence of the deep interest which tbe great body of citizens lake in the progrecs of the country toward a more general and com plete establishment at whatever cist, of universal security and freedom in the ex ercise of tne elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention trom our people, both in tne sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative iuteresls of,the Government however urgent or weighty, will ever display tbe zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of iiiizenauip, ana mat ine powtr ot public opinion will override all political prejudice and all sectional and S.ate attachments, in demanding that, all over our wide territory, the name and character of a citizen of tbe United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and pattiotism of all good citizens of every (.art of tbe country, however much they may bo divided in opinioni on other , political subjects, to unite in compelling' obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Con gress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has ihowa, and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke ' the co-operation of tbe exec utive and legislative authorities of the States in ' this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind cn be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rightj.no serious ob jection will thwart or delay the complete pacification of tbe country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity. On the subject of civil service re form, which the President treats at some length, be says: "In view of the faota that during a consid erable period the government of Great Britain has been dealing with administra tive problems and abuses in various par ticulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that in reoent years the meas ures adopted were understood to have been effective and in averyfrespect highly satis factory, I thought h desirable to have fuller information upon tbe subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thor ough investigation for this purpose. Tbe ruault has been an elaborate and tompre heniiva report Tbe report sets forth the history of tho partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the Parliamentary patronage and of official interference witn the freedom of elections. It show that alter long trials of various kinds of examjnations,and open on equal term 'to all, and which are carriod on under the superintendence of a ; tingle commiasion, have with great advantage been established as copditiont of admission to almost every ofUoial place in the subor dinate administration kjf that country of British India. The completion of tbe re port, owing to the extent of labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Con gress to make any provision either for the composition or the expenses of the com mission, has been postponed until the pres ent time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While tbe reform measures of anothor government are of no authority for us, they are entitlod to influence to the ex tent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to . our institutions and : social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have bertstoforo exprested concerning ibe defects and abuses in our civil administration remain uncbanned. ex cept in so far as enlarged experjMice htuf vpeuuu luy bviibu-tti u uuty OV Bom Hie officers and of tbe people themjelvVi'co operate (or their removal. AMfga and re sponsible part of the dutysr? ritoring tho civil service to the desired-jjuriy and effi ciency rests upon the Ptesidont, and it has been uiy purpose to do what is within my power to advar ce such prudent and grad ual measures of reform will moat surely and rajvitily bring about tbe radical change of sybkAfti essential to make our adminis tratis method aisfactory to a free and intavligant pouple.

Va tbe subject ot competitive examinations fur office ho says : I think th-o economv. purity and efficiency of the public service would Do greatly uromned bv tbeir a vs. tematic introduction wherever practirab e tnrougnout tne entire civil service of the Government, togetbor vith ample provis ions in order to secure cuniistency and uni form justice. Jleports of examinations heretofore made show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that tbe goneral application of similar rules can not fail to be of decided benefit to lb ser vice. I deem it my duty to renew the re commendation contain in my annual message of December, 1877, requesting Congress to make the neccessary appro priations for the resumption of tbe work of tbe Civil Service Comnission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moder ate compensation to persons in the public service who may perftrrn extra labors upon or under the Goimissicn as the Executive may direct It may not be ea y, and it may never, porhi.(B, be necessary, to define with precision tJu proper limit of political action on tbe part of Federal officers; but, while their light to bold and freely express their opinions can not be questioned, it is very pla t that they should neither be allowed to dorble to other sub jects the timo needed f-j the proper dis charge of tbeir official duties, nor to use the authority of their oHw to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the political ac tions of tboie who hold Jtforent opinions. Keasuns of justice and publio policy, quito analogous to those whici forbid the use of official power for t;e oppression of the private citizen, iiljose upon the Government the dut.vf of protecting its officers and agents fntm arbitrary ox actions, from whatever aoct considered. The uractioeof miking lefies for party pur poses, upon the salaries o officers, is highiJ ly demoralizing 10 me niuiru service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free is any other cili xon to give his own mjneyin aid of his opinions or bis party, heiiould alio be as free as any other citizen refuse to mug sneh ff-fui.
