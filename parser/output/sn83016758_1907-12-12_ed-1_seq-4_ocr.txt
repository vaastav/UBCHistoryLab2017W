4 i&~ THE PRINCETON UNION BY R. O. DUNN. Publish** "Enmity ThMdy a TIRM8-SI.00 PER YEAR IN ADVANOE. 1.2s I NOT PAID I N ADVANCE. PFIO KI FIRST S EAST or COURTHOUSK. a. I. STAPLES. Bnalneaa Manager. TMOS. H. PROWSB. Editor. Unlucky Mr. Fairbanks. Piatt has indorsed his presidential candidacy. Just now it is easier to estimate the amount of money invested in stocks than that which is hidden in socks. In the event of the introduction of a more elastic currency the dead beats might be expected to attempt a stretching of their credit. Old Gassaway Davis is still after the second place on the ticket, but this time it is the matrimonial and not the presidential ticket. The resumption of operation by the big factories throughout the country is a sure sign that business is assum ing its former equilibrium. Taft laughed when told that the czar was very thankful he passed through Russia without being dynamited. But Mr. Taft was really more thank ful than the czar. An unmistakable sign that the "panic" is over is a scare-headed article in a Boston paper that the cautious old city is about to open an other bean bakery. The suggestion of the president in his annual message that expenses of great political parties be paid by congress is another heavy and direct slam at the "interests." And now the state supreme court hops on malt and rules that bever ages alleged to be made therefrom are intoxicating and cannot be sold other than in licensed saloons. Four years in the white house is sufficient for any man, declares Mr. Bryan. This is equivalent to saying, "You couldn't work any of your third term schemes on me, gentlemen." The fellow who is phonographically recording the noises of New York probably sees a fortune in supplying cylinders to next year's baseball and football teams for rooting purposes. Governor Johnson must have felt embarrassed when delivering his spiel before the national rivers and har bors convention at Washington with out the presence of Prompter O'Day in the wings. The recall by Japan of Ambassador Aoki will be greatly felt in Washing ton society, for the baron is one of the most adept bridge and poker players that ever stacked cards in the mansions of the diplomats. Harry S. New of Indianapolis has been chosen chairman of the national republican committee and Chicago selected as the place of holding the convention. June 16 has been fixed as the date for such conpention. It should not be supposed that America is the only country where a financial depression has been felt. Even our nearest neighbor, Canada, which has no Roosevelt to charge a "panic" to, was as greatly affected as ourselves. Secretary of the Treasury Cortel you, in his annual report, reiterates his suggestion that a more elastic currency be introduced. Father would find this mighty convenient now that the kids are anticipating the arrival of Kris Kringle. The Appeal to Treason says: "About all the really go4&. |men who -ever lived have been tin prison." This is of course the veriest tommy rot, but may be the editor of the Appeal seeks to throw a bouquet at himself by such utterance. Luther Burbank's latest production is a thornless cactus. As the cactus denuded of its prickles makes nutri tious cattle feed, this outcome of Mr. Burbank's graft-or rather grafting bids fair to become of great impor tance to stockraisers. The only animals which can be successfully raised on a diet of cactus with its spines on seem to be burros and goats. are testing the possibility of sustain ing life upon a diet of peanuts, cactus flax seed, etc. These experimenters are not near as big fools, however, as the fellows who try to sustain life on whiskey. John Goodnow, formerly of Minne apolis, died at Malaga, Spain, Mon day. Mr. Goodnow served as consul to Shanghai. China, for several years, and prior to that time was engaged in buisness in Minneapolis, where he fig ured quite prominently in local poli tics. He had many ardent friends and not a few unrelenting enemies. As the trial of Harry Thaw ap proaches the dailies are beginning to publish pictures of Mrs. Thaw attired in the latest fashions and to eulogize her for sticking to her husband in the time of his trouble. This is the kind of stuff a certain class of the public demands* and the papers are expected to supply it. Greely says in his Big Fork Com pass: "There is some talk of running a Frank Eddy for governor on the re- and that man is John Queste of Read- publican ticket "wito the endorsement ing, Pa., who recently received one of of the prohibition party. It sounds the new ten-dollar gold pieces, like a dream like Eddy used to dream' attempting to pass the shiner at sev when he tested the cup that cheers and eral business houses without success the bottle that yells." [John buried it in his cellar. Not find ing the words, "In God We Trust," on the coin the business men refused to have anythinglo do with it, It is a significant fact that during the financial disturbance the number of bank failures has averaged no more than when the money situation i a letter to the governor Mr was normal. But at the same time Francis B. Hart, a Minneapolis law these failures have attracted wider This little paragraph anent charac ter assassins from the pen of Jane Porter is well worth reading: I never .yet heard man or woman much abused that I was not inclined to think the better of them and to transfer any suspicion or dislike to the person who appeared to take de light in pointing out the defects of a fellow creature.'' At a banquet given in his honor at Washington last week a boom was started by the Pennsylvania republi can congressional delegation for thesmoking. presidential candidacy of Senator Philander C. Knox. While Knox' is an eminently qualified man he will find that the old warrior "knocks" will prove a formidable antagonist. There is no ambiguity in the langauge employed by Preisdent Roosevelt in discussing the eight hour law. He declares unequivocally in favor of the law and says, "The general introduction of the eight-hour day should be the goal toward which we should steadily tend, and the government should set the example in this respect." There was a falling off in the im portation of precious stones in No vember compared with the corre sponding month of 1906 amounting to $1,826,792. This goes to show that the husbands of such women as im port gems were benefited by thehearers financial situation. Their money was tied up where their wives could not get hold of it. There is talk in England of intro ducing a bill in parliament making compulsory the attachment of a device to automobiles which shall pre clude the possibility of their going faster than a stipulated rate of speed. Such a law would be a good one for public protection, but it would be turned down cold by the house of lords. the fitness of some of his brother ad- selected from captains who are essen- There is one man at least who has good excuse for hoarding his gojd,, yer attention in consequence of the supreme court of Minnesota, and inti stringency. "Big fools!" This is the remark you often here applied to the men who expresses his contempt for ma tes that there is cause for impeach ment proceedings. Our supreme court is composed of mortals and is not in But a court made up fallible. uu oi uuuiu iiittue up angels from heaven could not render decisions that would meet with the approbation of the average Minne apolis lawyer. President Roosevelt has given a gentle hint to Postmaster General Hitchcock and Commissioner of Inter nal Revenue Capers that, while he has no objection to their attempt to secure delegates for Cortelyou, he is opposed to their stating that he favors Cortelyou's nomination as much as he does Taft's. Better than this would have been a demand by the president that all federal officeholders refrain from dabbling in politics. "St. Paul's superintendent of public schools estimates that there are at least two thousand boys attending those institutions who are addicted to the cigarette habit, and an attempt is now being made to stamp out the thethe A*evil by empowering teachers to cause the arrest of pupils caught in the aqfc of But why not commence, at the root of the evil by demanding^ |ihe enforcement of^the state law whjch prohibits the selling or giving, of tobacco in any form to minors? The superstitious have slated to morrow as a day of calamitythey fear its coming. Tomorrow is '^Fri- day the Thirteenth." The last Friday the thirteenth was in September and the next will be in March of next year. This year's calendar shows two such days and that of 1908 butSun one. People who believe in the un-s luckiness of Friday, of the number thirteen, and of the double unlucki nes of the Friday and thirteen com bination are equally as foolish as those who believe in witchcraft. Rev. Rood of the Sleepy Eye Congregational church asked his why so many men were so anxious to secure a back seat when attending divine service. The question still remains unanswered. It may be, however, that they are afraid the minister will smell their breaths. And then, again, there is a proba bility that they want to dodge out when the collection plate approaches or the minister's sermon is too long winded. W leave the problem for closer observer to solve som Rear Admiral Willard H. Brown son, chief of the bureau of naviga tion, doesn't appear to think much of United States would willingly concur Among those who attended the rivers and harbors congress at Wash ington was James J.

Almost 60 per cent of the taxes raised in Princeton are for public school purposes, and more than 66 per cent of all the taxes raised in Milaca are for public schools. These figures do not include the one mill state scbppl tax or the 23-100 of a mill for' the state university. oofman i Adjutant General Ainsworth, in histotal annual report, suggests that America adopt a conscript system as a means of keeping the army and navy up to their standard complements. In the first place the people of this country would tolerate no such tyranny as a conscription law, and then, again,* no such method is necessary to secure soldiers and sailors. If the govern ment pays men a fair salary it can ob tain all it needs. The recommendation of President Roosevelt in his message that a close co-operation be maintained between interstate commerce commission and the state commission is a feather in the cap of Railroad Commissioner Staplesit is directly in line with the suggestion of Mr. Staples to Chair Knapp some months ago and it looks as if the president derived his idea therefrom. The annual report of the secretary of agriculture, just published, is a highly interesting book and shows, among other things, that $7,412,000,- 000 worth of farm produce has been raised during the past year. This is 10 per cent more than the value of the total production of 1906, although at the crops have not been quite as good as those of that year. The total value for 1907 is also 17 per cent more than in 1905, 20 per cent above that of 1904, 25 per cent in excess of 1903, and 57 per cent greater than the value for 1899. Thomas J. O'Brien, American am bassador to Japan, has called down the Japanese government for its laxity in enforcing the emigration laws. It appears that large numbers of Japs are gaining admission to the United States under pretense of being studentsthat is, they make affidavit that they are about to enter some American institution of learning. When they arrive here, however, they hire out to whomsoever will employ them and thus violate the law. Mr. O'Brien is determined to show the little copper-colored sneaks that even though they fool the inspectors at San Francisco and other Pacific coast points they cannot fool him. O'Brien is a good ambassador. In these strenuous times it is grati fying,to know that some of the news paper boys are prospering. The Bel view Independent has discarded its old Washington hand press and in stalled an up-to-date cylinder press and otherwise added to its equipment. In the near future Bro. Tuttle expects to dispense with patent "insides" and print an all home paper. The Vern dale Sun has also recently invested in a power press, and although the has always been a good paper it i better now than ever before. Mr. Olson of the Anoka Free Press is an other publisher whom the money stringency does not seem to affect as he is engaged in renovating his office building and contemplates im provements in his paper. Col. and Mrs. J. F. Stone's Rush City Post has completed its thirty-second year and is as bright and winsome as a girl of sixteen. Greece is overrun with refugees, who flee from their homes and lands in the contiguous states of Eoumelia. Bul garia, Roumania and the Caucasus. These refugees land in Athens and oth er ports so poor that the Greek govern ment is compelled out of humanity to shelter and feed them. Every steamer which lands passengers in Greece brings a resh contingent, and the Greek government has hit upon a plan to make permanent citizens of the aliens and put them on their feet as producers. In order to encourage industry and thrift the Greek government has ar ranged to give land to the refugees, to gether with means to build and work the soil. Mechanics and tradesmen will be helped to .open stores or shops, and there will be grants for churches, schools and public pasturage, in fact the whole equipment of a peasant colo ny A bauk founded by the govern ment will handle the financial end of the scheme, the refugees paying in an nually a sum which will wipe out their in thirty years. The bank will be under the control of the Greek minister of finance, thus enabling the govern ment to insure justice to all concerned. In this way it is believed that large areas of abandoned lands in Greece may be made productive and the wealth of the nation increased. Old stagers who suavely advise oth ers to stick to the simple life on outing vacations are usually experts on quick cures for "the morning after" sensa tion.
