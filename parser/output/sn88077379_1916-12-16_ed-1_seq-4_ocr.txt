l -L THE LABOR ADVOCATE FOOD EMBARGO IS OPPOSED BY LABOR LEADERS Columbus, O., Dec. 1.1. Oruanizctl labor in Oliio probably will declare for mally against an embargo on foodstuffs when the executive board of the State Federation of Labor meets here this month. That an embargo might later spread to proportions which would cripple American industries and injure work ingmen's interests is the feeling of cer tain labor leaders. "The embargo looks plausible at first, but latcr reflection proves it isn't the square tiling cither to American pro ducers or foreign countries," said O. 15. Chapman, federation vice president. "Ah embargo is not the best way to cut the high cost of living," said Thom as Donnelly of Cincinnati, secretary of the federation. "What we need arc laws to jail food speculators and perhaps laws making il legal the storage of food products ex cept to tide the country over nonpro ductive seasons." 

DKKIOXDS I'XIOX SHOP. Tacoma, Wash. Secretary Taylor of the State federation of labor defended the union shop in a joint debate with Secretary Irvine of the Washington Uni plojcrs' association. The unionist de clared thai "there is a certain moral price below which it is crime for the toiler to sell his labor." Secretary Irvine favored the non-union shop, which he called "open shop." I Ic believed many strikes could be avoid ed if employes and employers "would get their feet under the same table and talk things over." lie was against strong organization of ilic workers, how ever, despite the fact that experience has shown that that power alone forces emplojers to meet their emplojcs.

Circuit Court Judge Stone has ruled that benefits paid workers un der the llinois compensation law shall be based on their gross earnings. A miner employed by the Brewster & Evans Coal company was injured and the company objected to the compensa tion award because the board included as earnings the sum of $25l.fi7 for pow der, fuses, check wcighman, union dues, union assessments, donations, etc., which the company deducted from the pay of its empIoe. Judge Stone called attention to the fact that there is no law compelling a miner to use powder, fuses, or to sharpen his tools, though these things would facili tate his work. Check weighnicn and union dues, also, were optional with the miner, said the court. "The court is unable to see wherein that situation is changed by the fact that the emplojer is given permission to de duct these items of expense; thai is evi dently an arrangement for the conven ience of the parties and the protection of the emplojer against loss, which, in the view of the court, docs not touch the question here. "A portion of these items are evident ly a part of the tools with which the miner works, just as the saw and square are a part of the tools with which the carpenter works. They arc the regular and general tools used in that employ ment and in no wise, as it appears to the court, can be construed 'special ex penses.' "The court can readily see that if the position taken by ihe respondents is the correct one, it might readily follow, par ticularly in cases where operating com panies provide grocery stores and houses in which to supplj the emphnes homes, that the grocery bill and the "house rent might well be taken as 'special expenses' for which the emplojer extends such credit. Certainlj the law could not have contemplated such a result. "It is the opinion, therefore, of the court that the term 'earnings' shall ap ply to the gross earnings of the emploje and that the items sought lo be deducted cannot be properly included as items of 'special expense' entailed in the nature of the employment.' " PROTEST TO MAYOR .Mcill Cutters to Heck lOiiloicciiicnl on Sunday Closing. Husiness Agent Michael Schuld, Meat Cutters' Union, last Tuesday evening sought support of Ceutial La hoi Council lo assist in preparing a protest to be pre sented to Major I'uchla to enforce the state law forbidding stores to remain open on Sunday. For several weeks Musiness Agent Schuld has been active in obtaining war rants for butchers who have been work ing union meat cutters on Sunday. An agreement was reached last week where by no union meat cutter is to work on Sundaj, but the butcher is to be allowed to keep open if he desires to do the work himself. Delegates from MoMiiakers' Union, No. I.I.'IK reported a man unauthorized was soliciting funds from union officials for personal ' use. In one instance it was .said he had attempted to procure $100 f i out a delegate.

C Iiailinad man agers ami the Government have come to an agreement on carrying the fight oer the Light-Hour Law to the United Slate Supreme Court. They have de cided to use the recent decision bv Fed eral Judge Hook, in Kansas City, as the vehicle for all their aigunients for and against the constitutionality of the Adainson Law. Under the terms of this agreement both sides will appear before the United Stales Supreme Couit, when it con venes December 1, and join in a plea to have tlii' Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf Kail load case advanced so there may be a speedy decision, Meanwhile no more suits will be filed by the railroads against ihe law, and the managers will prepare for an adverse decision by so arranging their accounts that they may be able to meet any de mands of their employes because of a (at hue to work them hut eight hours. Il is understood that the railroads wanted the law tested in the ease of a larger railroad, especially the Atchison, Topeka it Santa Fe, but the Govern ment insisted thai every question of law was contained in the Judge Hook decis ion, which involved a smaller road. The Government agrees, however, that any railroad may file arguments in such inaiinei as to include then ohiections lo the law. llalttinore. Mil. In a speech before Ihe . h' of 1..

President Wilson's message to the joint session of congress, included a recommendation that exist ing federal arbitration and mediation laws be amended to provide that "a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lock out may lawfully be attempted." This suggestion is similar to the pres ent Canadian industrial disputes inves tigation act which makes strikes in pub lic utilities illegal unless the dispute is first investigated by a commission ap pointed by the government. Thc Trades and Labor Congress of Canada, at its convention last September, called on the Dominion government to repeal this law, which has been in effect nine jears. On the eight-hour question President Wilson made this recommendation : "The establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the emplo) ment of all rail road emplojes who are actually engaged in thc work of operating trains in inter state transportation. Congress was also urged to empower the chief executive, in case of militaiy necessity, "to take control of such por tions anil such rollinir stock of the rail ways of the country as mas be required for militarj use and to operate them for militao purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of thc United States such train crews and administra tive officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use." Vocational and industrial education was urged, as was the proposed amend ments of the organic law of Porto Kico. Dettmer Hardware Co.
