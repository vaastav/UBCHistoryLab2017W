S'SmS cmm and all pans of the army will b? put on th* aame honorable footing. The marked distinction made In flavor of the offi cers of engineers by the sixty-third Article of War has been the causa of a great deal of nunc tiler; but when taken in connection with the ninety-sixth artiole, I am satisfied that within "the Hue of their Immediate prolPMinn" the* are aa much sub ject to orders as the officers of the Quartermaster's Department. To place them on duty outside the sphere of their proiessioual duties is, lu my opinion, all that was ever intended by the sixty-third article as requiring the orden of me President; yet the conclusion arrived at by the committee la the interpretation which engineers, officers themselves, have usually placed 011 the law. and for this reason in the nuw Articles of War the one In question is omitted alto gether. For my part 1 have no wish to command the engineer corps or any other corps, but If It forms a part or liio reuular army of the United SUtes It la all-importajit that the generals who command the military departments, and aro charged with the gen eral supervision of all army matters within their limits, should be able to avail themselves o( this most important branch ot the army, receive from them the usual raporta or the slate i\I the national deicncos, Ac., wituout asking it as u special lavor or applying to the President tor his penutsstou In each case. Boino or tho other "reiorins" suggested in this Con gressional report havo already been made. The 1'resideut has, by an executive order, recuced the civilian employes or tho Quartermaster's De partment trorn n,?T'i men to 4,ouu, and these are not subject to the personal command of the Quarter master ooneral, but are, m fact, teamsters and laborers, hired In the distant Territories under tne supervision of the local quartermasters, and under the control ol' the military department comuiande/a. lu like manner the number of ordnance enlisted workmen has been reduced from 1,101 to 144, and to department commanders has ooen given the super vision of tne recruiting depots in ail essential mat ters, except the final assignment ot recruits to regi ments, which is controlled here by the uenerai-in Chief, who can best Judge where the recruits are most needed. Aa to the consolidation of the staff corps and departments, discussed lu this report, I feel disposed to concur with Ueperal Thomas in bis opinion as given lu evidence on page thirteen of this "Report on Army Organizatlon," that it would hardly be wise to make this change to the extent which tne counnmeo seems to favor, lhe Chief signal Officer might be attached to the engineer corps or to one of the staff depart ments, and the forty post chaplains now In ser vice ungtit be aasigued one to each of the forty regi ments which now compose the army. I would doem It advisable to ailow tne other corps and departments to remain unchanged, except with such limits as to the number and rank of otllcers as con gress may adjudge proper, in numbers and rank tney do seem disproportioned to the line of tne army, but this has been tho case for a number ol years, and the experience ot the war of the rebellion demon strated its wisdom. A staff system that has admit ted an increase of the liue ot tue army lrom the mere nuclous of 1880 to a million of men, and tho reduction back to the present standard wltnout con fusion and with the most perfect accountability as to properly and money?at all times providing for the army abundantly? is entitled to our respect. 1 havo therefore.laid before you the annual reports t>f the heads of ail tho stuff corps and departments, but nave noted certain mailers lu them especially Directing tho army itself that I now beg leave to ler to. The Quartermaster General shows that the dis bursements ol Ins department have fallen $14,600,(100 below tuove of tlie previous year. This department Is more ailucted b, the scattered condition of the troops and the peculiar sterile character of tho coun try iu which tuey are kept than uuy other, if the army could lie concentrated and quartered in the region of Hupplle^ the expenses coiuu bo kept down to a comparatively small Bum; or if we had, as in former years, u single line or jrentier a little in ad vance or the settlements, the same or simiiai would ne thu result; but now, from the nature of the case our troops are scattered by companies to posts iu tho most Inhospitable parts or the Continent, to winch every article ol food, lorage, clouting, ammu nition, Ac., must he hauled in wagons hundreds of miles ut. gt eac cost. For the same reason this de partment is heavily taxed bv the cost of fuel ami materials for making huts, sometimes at a distance ol ioo or iiOU in lies from a place where a growing twig aa large as a walking stick oau be louuu. V hbo tne pay and allowances of a soldier remain the same m all parts of the country the cost of his maiuteuanee in Texas, New .Mexico, Arizona. Ne vada, Idaho, Montana and Alaska is two aud threo times as great as on the Kansas aud Nebraska iron tier. if. tuererore, tne estimates must be made to approximate those ol tne ante-war period, wo may be rorced to withdraw our troops from all or a larire part or the Territories named. I have personal knowledge that the huts in which our troops are rorced to live are in some places inferior to what horses usually have lu this city. Nearly a.l ol these posts are temporary lu their nature and character; but as time progresses aud roads become established wo can choose the real strategic points, and at wioso wo should have good quarters lor troops, and I hopo tho (secretary will ask a liberal appropriation, suo Ject to his control, lor tho erection of the accessary barracks. in referenco to tho report of the Commissary General, Ueneral Eaton, it is proper tout 1 should say that the army has beeu well supplied with good healthy mod, and at ult the posts are kept supples of articles not embraced in tne ration, ior sale to the companies ano the officers' families at a price suffi cient to ie:iui urse the department. Tins ooviates the necessity tig- sutlers, which are now prohibited by law, except us mero traders, having no lieu what ever on the soldier's pay. Thu olilcers of the Sub sistence Department arc at depots, aud the actual issues to the troops are made by lino otllcers, styled acting commissaries of subsistence, who receive an extra compensation of twenty dollars a mouth, less tne value of a ration. (Hoe section two, act or Con gress approved March 2, isz7). From per sonal experience 1 doubt if it be practi cable to commission theso officers specially aa such, or to appoint permanent coraiuis saiy sergeauts, because ol the cou.-taiit changes of stations ol our small army; but 1 tuiukthoy should have a lair compensation ior the extra labor and risk Imposed on them by these dunes. 1 recom mend the repeal ol tuo proviso or the second section hereinbefore referred to, aiul that tne officers acting aa quartermasters and commissaries of posts re ceive ten dollars a month where there are two com panies or less, and twenty dollars a mouth where the garrison is more than iwo companies. The Engineer Department has charge of tho con struction of the permanent forts, the improvement ot rivers, harbors, and various other duties imposed by spec ial laws, ao much as refers to the /oris con cerns the army that must live In them and flgii: them, and therefore falls within my official province. All else not directly uilectiug tho army is uoue ol my business. General Humphreys gives In great detail the con dition ol tho various forts with whose construction alteration nnd repair las department has been en gaged. Nearly nil tho seacoast forts were planned ut a time waen the eight-inch gun was the Heaviest afloat, and before rlflod guns came into use. Now however, mat ordnance of the ruteeti aud twenty inch calibres, throwing a shot over 1,000 pounds in weight, wliit a ve.oclty of 1,500 feet per second, liavo conw into g> nerui use, tue problem or resistance is entirely chunked. It is bclirvod tnat casemate loris no muitct liow rolnioiced with iron, uro not ubl? to resist these uhot, and changes must bo made to meet tms change of Jucts. The engineer officers nave carefuilj studied tills subject and havo niado many most vaiuabie exoeriments; aud in connection wim the officers or ordnance an ! artillery, they should continue theso experiments. Tho Hoard of Engi neers In New York has laid down Ave general propo sitions lor application to all modifications ?r the aea coust fo?ts, whlce I liearuly approve, Viz. Firs'.?The use of barbette batter.ea of earth, with deep parapet, and a liberal number of bombproof and magazine traverses. .v-ivii .?The use of the heaviest guns practicable, with carriages admitting of the gun being de.ire -sod below tha parapet for loading. T/iinl.?An abundant supply of h?avy mortars. >' >wth?The use ol torpedoes. Fifi Entanglements to hold a tloot loug euotigh for destruction. * Taking the new "Fort WlnthroD" In Boston har bor as a sample, lam fancied that the,e proposi tions fulfil an die conditions oi the problem, f.o loreign army wnl no lively to attempt a lauding on oni coast, and ail that a host Ho licet can at tempt will be to run by tho roits anil lay the cities under contribution. On firm land we can hau die guns of heavier caiJbro and with more accuracy of aim than any enemy can hisaflo.it; and lu my Judgment no armored ship as yet built can long exist within tho l an go ol our twenty-inch guns, or even oi tue ntieou-ltich guns, it skliiully handled. 1 tliere JOfQ recommend mat the forts covering the cities of Portland, boston, New York, l'hUadoipiila, uulu mo.e, New Orleans and dan Francisco, suould bo poshed to completion as soon as practicable.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL. Monday, Dec. 8?# P. *? The speculative feeling ut the beginning of busi ness this morning was almost wholly concentrated upon the gold market, where, despite the opposition of the "bears," thq price watt run up from 122% to 123%. The strength put forth on either sido was not of (^decided character, both parties seeming desir ous of waiting (or the President's Message and the reports of his Cabinet oflloers. The earliest tele grams from Waahiugton were very positive in pre dicting that thore would he no quorum of Congress, owing to the detention or members by tho storm. Tins intelligence was sueoeeded by the heavy snow storm here, and uiunv ol the chief operators left tho street and went home, so that the subsequent publi cation of tho teuor or the Message and reports fell upon a thin market. The announcement of tho President's position on the question of redumption turned tho speculative feeling lu the Gold Room, iliough for wuat reason it la difllcult to conjecture, as his plan oi a k ran ual approach to specie payments is exactly the policy which tne gold "bulls" would have hnu pursue. Every business man in the coun try will read with profound satisfaction the recommendation of General Qrant on this Im portant subject. His clear, common senate view of the situation is In keeping with the mau. and will render hlni popular with the entire mercantile community. The cliques in Wall street can derive littlo coinlort from what be proposes. In fact, the halting speculation in goid lo-day was tlie result of a second sober thought on the part of the same parties who begun last week to lay their plans for a bold movement. Alter tho price had Been pushed to 123% tney seemed to lack the courage of sustaining tbo effbrt. especially aa their numbers were already thlnued by the storm. It is true the nubsequent dec Hue to 1 22% wia par t tally tho result of- the advance of our bonds In London, which had the efleot of weakening exchange, but the faot remains that the cliques were nonplussed at tho situation, aud, after making a ratuer brililaut sortie, have fallen back for a council of war. The money market was ea->y at seven per cent to borrowers on call with pledge of stock collaterals, but In most in stance* the leuding government dealers were ac commodated at six. There is very littlo anxiety as to tho Immediate future of the money market, aud ilio impression seems general that at tnls late sea son, when the cotton crop has taken all tho monoy that la nece3*ary to its movement, and with little or no doinnnd from the West, the local supply will bo more than ample 'or tho balance of the winter. In commercial paper tnore vt&a no chango, despite tho announcement of tho suspension of a couple of dry goods Jobbing houses. The stock market was strong at the opening, and prices wore generally In advance of the closing quo tations of Saturday. Toward noon It became weak aud fell off at the last board, In sympathy with tho decline in gold. Tho fluctuations wero not wide, as tue market lias ranged of late days, and wero made upon a limited amount of business, the chief opera tors seeming to await the effcot of the Congressional documents. Tho dealings after the board snowed an improvement, aud the latest prices In tho Long Room were almost up to the best of tho day for tho leading speculative lavorltes. In the railways there was a spirited "near" attack on l.ake Shore, and the price went otr to 85%, the other Western shares going off at tho same time, lu Chicago and Alton there was a sharp decline to 141, the stock being under the manipulation of parties coming from St. Louis. In tho miscellaneous list I'cclflc Mall was feverish, and after falltug to 49% rallied to JO?*'. The announce ment of a semi-annual dividend of only two per cout on Western Union produced no effect, as the ??inside" party who managed to work the stock up to 45 last spring by a quurtcrly dividend of the same figure ure now on l ie outside aud would like to icet the stock back again, of which they aro, further more, reported to be largely short. The government market was excited, particularly at the noon board, in consequeuco of an advance of one to one and a half per cent In tho London quota tions of this uioruUu a3 compared with Saturday. The foreign bankers wore large buyers on foreign account, which fact and the simultaneous advance in gold led to salos of 67's at as hign as 118%. lu me subsequent transactions at tlie boar J, as well as on the street, tho market lost its stiength and yielded to tiie following closing prices:?United States cur rcacy sixes, 107% a 107%; do. sixes, 1881, regis tcfeU, 113 a 113do., coupon, U7% a 118',,; do., live-twenties, registered, May and November, 112J? a 1X2; do., 1802, coupon, do., lis% a 116%; do., 1804, coupon, do., 112% a 112%;#do., 1865, coupon, do., 113'4 a 113%; do., registered, January and July, 111 a 111).'; do., IS0 5. coupon, do., 116% a 115V, do. 1867, coupon, do , 116% a US'*; do., 1S88, coupon,, do, 115% a 116%; do. ten-forties, rogi.tered, ios a 108%; do., coupon, 108J* a 109. Tho making oi bills against tho bonds purchased for export by the foreign bankers weakened the foreign exchanges, while the strength or t!i<j gold market. In the earlier hours of business checked the usual demand from the importers. The Southern State bonds were feverish and irregular lu tne Tennessees, which opened heavy and weak, and after declining to 40% for the new issues, rallied to 4a X for the same securities. The North caroliuas wore firmer and advanced a half to one per cent. The general list was steady and dull.
