LEGISLATIVE NOTF-S. Hy the failure of our usual editorial letter to reach us thin week, we arc thrown on.our *>nly resource for Legisla live ne*'?-our daily exchange?--from which we mai:-; up tho following note? : In the House on Wednesday, 30th ult., nearly the entire day sessiou wat taken up in thc consideration of the .Stock law. and a motion to .strike out the enact ing clause was lost hy a vote of 7'? to 40. Ou the following day tho friends pf the measure applied the parlia ? entary ?crew, called the previous question, pass d the hill again to a third reading by a vote of 72 to i'?, and then, to clinch the matter and place it beyond thc power of the House, tabled a motion lo reconsider. The bill as it passed goes into operation on thc 15th of Mareil next, hy which date the counties of Georgetown, llorry and Williamsburg, ihrec Counties not included in the hill, will have to have their county fences built. Hurry i.? allowed to u^e her boundary rivi r as fences. Thc bill is now being considered in thc .Senate. On the consideration ot the bill in the House, Messrs. Murray, H?cker and Simpson, of our delegation, took part in thc discussion. At a meeting of the agricultural com mittee on Thursday, it was agreed to make no recommendation for the repeal of the Lieu iaw, and the repealers open ly threw up the sponge ; but in the morn ing session ou Friday the committee made a surprising change of front and reported to the House a bill for Ihe re peal of this much discussed law, the committee having had another meeting and reconsidered their action of the day previous. While the repealers arc in a hopeless minority, a very acrimonious discussion is expected. On Thursday tho Senate concurrid in the House resolution authorizing the State printer to print .r>,000 copies of the annual report of the State Commissioner of Agriculture for general distribution. On tho same day a bill introduced in the House by Mr. Ward, of Edgefield, making it a misdemeanor for "a laborer to violate a contract, whether such con tract be verbal or in writing," was killed on its first reading. Tho present law was considered ample protection for every ono. A bill was introduced in the Houso on Friday chartering thc Townville Hranch Railroad Company. A bill to prohibit the sale of intoxica ting liquor ; in the town of Seneca City, in Oconeo County, received its final reading in the House on Snturday. This measure caused quite a lengthy discus sion on Thursday. It had been reported unfavorably by tho committee, and was backed by several petitions, pro and con, tho member.-! from Oconeo hoing divided -Mr. Dendy supporting tho bill und Mr. Verncr against it. Thc Senate aud House both were occu pied nearly thc entire morning session in considering tho Election Law bill, which ?B, thus far, tho most important measure introduced. This is tho bill re ported by tho special commission ap pointed at the last session to revise the election laws of the State, tho general provisions of which were published in the 

INTELLIGENCES week before hist. It has been amended in several unimpor tant particulars, and tho prospect now is that it will become a law, notwith standing the fierce- opposition which it has met from some parties, notably Mr. Parker, of the Abbeville delegation, and Miller, tho colored Senator from^Reau fort. In consequence of thc large number of absentees on Saturday, nono of the im portaut mensures on the calendar were touched in tho House. A bill providing for thc rc opening of tho Stato Military Academy, reported by a special committee ou Saturday authorizes tho opening of tho Academy by tho board of visitors as soon as possession nt tbe Citadel buildings can be obi ai nee Povision is mado for the freo education and maintenance of two beneficiary cadets from each county in the State for two years after the open ing, after which time tho beneficiary cadets are to be apportioned among tho counties in proportion to the represen tation in tho lower houso of tho Gen eral Assembly. All beneficiaries aro required to teach after graduation for two years in freo public schools of the counties from which they arc appointed. Ten thousand dollars is appropriated for tho repairs of tho buildings and the purchase of tho necessary outfit, ond $15,000 for thc support of tho Academy during its first academic year. Tho Academy is to be deemed and taken a3 a ?"-nnch of the South Carolina Uni .ersi , sui" H however to tho solo ntrol and , "rvision of tho board of visitor*, oi . .a the Governor is ex offi president. The bill will undoubt edly meet with strong opposition, but its friends will make an equally stic^g fight for its success. Tho bill introduced by M>. Murrr.y, of which mention mado was last weok, to require the construction of fish ways across the dam on tho Savannah River near Augusta, was reported favorably on Sat urday and enrolled. On Monday there was no session of tho Senate, that body having adjourned on Friday until Tuesday, and nearly all of the Senators being at home visiting their families. In the Houso there was a very slim attendance, and the bills to . amend the election laws, to regulate tho railroads and remodel tho Constitution nero postponed for.further consideration before a full Houce, and only routine matters of small importance wore taken up. Among a number of bills passed to a third reading wo nclico one to provide artificial limbs for all soldiers of the State who lost their legs or arms or were permanently disabled io their lega or arms during military service from 1361 to '65 who havo not been supplied under former Acts of Assembly. After getting through with about ono fourth of the business on tho calendaron Monday, a rory interesting little skirmish j wa* broughton by a motion of Mr. Prince, of Anderson, lo take a recess until hall past 4 o'clock. This was voted down. Another motion was made to adjourn, and Ibis shared the same fate. Divis- ' ions were demanded on both motions, ! nod thc yeas and nays were called on the ? motion, the v< tc standing ?>?'< vi a- to 52 nays. Another motion was then made and adopted lo take a recess until half past 4 o'clock. The cause of all this voting was the coining on that morning of the Humpty Dumpty troop from Charleston, The average member can't wVrk for the Slate when lhere is a show td ?own, ami thc scarlet uniforms brass band and innocent donkey were more than the statesmen could stand.

In the present Cong rr*?, which assem bled pu I ?st Monday, the Republicans have a majori?) in both I Iou-.--, tili Saturday proceeding ibo in.?ting thc three parties held caucui-e.s losele?t their candidates for organizing the llou-e. In the Republican caucus there were ? num ber of ballots before a selection was made -Mr. Keifcr,of ohio. This i-. regard I ns a triumph of the Grant-Conkling fac tion. Two year- ago Rai ney was the nominee of the caucus for Clerk of the House. At that time thc nomination was merely a compliment, a- the Demo crats were in the majority, nod would 'certainly elect their candidate. At thc late caucus it was known that the nomi nee for Clerk would be elected, and po -r Hann y, who was again a candidate and very confident of the nomination, was complimented by a minority vote, and (eft out iii the cold. It is in this manner the Republicans deal with th<-ir colored nllii -. It is probable that Rai ney will be o ile red sonic subordinate place to appease his chagrin at the duplicity practicad to wards hint. All the nominees of tho Republican caucus to lill the oiiices of House, front Speaker to Doorkeeper, were clefted. THK Titi.11. OF (?riTKAU. Wc have devoted considerable space in titi- issue to the evidence, especially the evidence of the Icfenduiit in hit own behalf, elicited on the tria! ':f Guitcnu for the mtirderof President ( iarficld. This is the nio>t important State trial which has taken place. That Guilcau killed Garfield without provocation is admitted. The only defence is insanity. The pris oner admits the killing, bul alleges that he did the act by inspiration from God, and that he and the Deity killed the President; that he was simply the agent which thc Deity used, and that he was impelled to tho act by irresistible force which he could not resi-t. It is very ev ident that unless insanity is clearly proved, the prisoner will be condemned. Such is the clamor of the ?tress of the North for a sacrifice for the blood of thc late President, and the excited state of the public feeling of the great mass of people, that un!"s.s the insanity of thc prisoner is demonstrated beyond all rea sonable doubt, he will bc condemned, ami if condemned, executed us Mrs. Stirrat was, without any hope of executive in terference in the face of popular feeling. If Guilcau was not insane he ought to be executed. The security of our free in stitutions, the lives of our people, the ex istence of society and au outraged and violated law, demand his execution. Rut if Guiteau was insane, then lin is not guilty, for an insane man cannot com mit crime, and to execute him would be n barbarous and an inhuman act, which would ever rest as tv stigma upon the civilization of tho age. Tho civilized nations of the earth are looking in won der and astonishment at thc fairness ami length of the trial. If such a deed had been committed in Russia n Court Mar tial without any regard to the plea if insanity, would have hud tho prisoner executed in a few days. The patient, fair and impartial trial which Judge Cox lins afforded thc prisoner, must open the eyes of the world as to thc superiority of thc government and judiciary which afford to the humblest citizen the same rights and protection of [aw which thc highest dignitaries enjoy. Mr. Scoville, n brother-in-law- and counsel of tho prisoner, declared that if Guiteau was not insano ht 'it to be hung, nud that bu for tho bel io. r his insanity ho would not appear for t de fence, and by the firm and cons tentions manner in which bo hnscondut. d the defence on the plea of insanity aloin has made a most favorable impression. A number of thc medical witnesses sum moned ns experts lo hear the testimony, and then upon tho supposition that the testimony is true, to express their opinion ns to the insanity of tho prisoner, have been examined, and they all say that he is insane. At present it seems from the testimony that there will he either an acquittal or a mistrial. Guiteau protests agr' tho plea of insanity and the tcs ti ..j tending to establish it, and says he would rather hang ns u man than be acquitted as a fool. A Fatal Quarrel Over Card?.

Il?' seemed to be fei ling in good spirit*, his remarkable self-esteem and egotism never for an instant tailing bim, and bi? perfect confidence in a verdict favorable to himself is apparently undi niinished. At il.""?, alter the usual appeal from Marshal Henry for order in the couti- ? room, Court was opened and tho prison er was placed itt ibo witness box. Gui teau glanced al Iiis papers a moment anil then -aid: "I desire. Judge Porter, to state to you and the Court that I declino to answer questions that ar? lucre repe titions Of w hat Wo have already been ? over." Judge Potter i ni mediately resumed the cross-examination with the que* lion. "Wasoneof your purposes in r? moving the President to crean a de mand for your book?" A.

I did not know what tho effeel might be on ber. G. Then it depended entirely on voUr will? A. It depended on whether I hud a suit able opportunity. Mr I'orter inquired whv ito would not have shot in Mrs. Garfield's presence. Prisoner: "Ifyour head is so thiel; that you can't get the Idea in, I won't try to pound it in. Don'tusk your questions in a mean, sickly sort of way." Mr. Porter pressed hisquesiion, where upon the- prisoner quietly took up a pa per mid adjusting lila eyo-glasses began to read, paying no attention whatever lo th? counsel. I'orter: "What aro yon reading?'' Prisoner (without raising bis eves;) "I am glancing over the New York HeniM." Porter: "Don't yon think that the time ol' the ( "ourt mid the jury is of sonic value ?" Prisoner: "Not in tho way you are interrogating on this matter. It lias been discussed and repeated over ngain," ind the prisoner .settled himself baek in his chair to have a quiet rind. Mr. Scoville here interposed in support if Guitonu's objection to repetition, .nul ifter some discussion between counsel, tho cross-examination was resinned ami breded to tho events of tho morning of Inly 2d. The prisoner, at'ter be waa started ot: Ibis subject, went ahead, and when Mr. I'orter attempted to tusk ii question ho was told to keep quiet.

"Hut," continued tho prisoner, excitod y, "my duty to the Lord and tho A mor can people overcame my personal feol ngs. If the Lord had n?t inapired that et it would not have been dono." Mr. Scoville then proceeded with tho odlreot examination, nppnrently Hooking o remove tho impression created by tho onclusion of tho cross-examination.

Ci u Hean, (angrily:) You're going too fast in this matter. We want facts, not your judgment. Tho witness has stilted one'bing right-the Lord injects tho In spiration and thou lets a mau uschisowii judgment to w ork il out. That's just my case. That's the way I got my inspira tion. Tho I.ord don't employ fools to do his work He gets tho best material. Mr. Davidge then put ?it still stronger hypothetical case, using the term, "Like II common vulgar i rimiual." Guitcuu turned to Mr. Davidgo and with au air ol' immense superiority said : "There's nothing vulgar ubout this case. It's all high toned." [Laughter, quickly suppressed by tho Court.[ Tho witness thought that au insano mau in carrying out an inspiration would act ucuording to his peculiarities if manner and temperament, although lhere were types Ol' insanity where a man's g?nerai character became changed. Witness gave thu scientific name Richard .1. Hinton, editor of thu \\ fish ington Gazette, had seen tho prisoner at Itepublicnu headquarters in New York md formed thu opinion that bu was an .xeccdlngly ill-balanced, cranky egotist. Witness was asked what bu thouuht of :bu prisoner's speech entitled "Garfield i's. Hancock," und replied," that in bis ipili ion it waa a ridiculous, disjointed iliair. Uuitcau, wdio had smiled complacently ?vh?n the witness came upon thu stand, locarno very much incensed ?md shouted nit : "Well, it wasn't anything of tho ?ind. You don't know what yon aro alking about. My speech was endorsed iy thu best men in tho country." Witness resumed by saying that thu irisoiicr seemed to boa perfect nuisanee ibout thu rooms. "You were a nuisance (Ourself. I'd rather bu hung as a man iiiiu acquitted as a fool, rand - woa'thave my more of this kind of evidence." Witness added that G ni teatl was a nughing stock, so far ns ho could see. G ul teuu becamo greatly enraged, and .urning to Mr. Scoville shouted, "If you mt any moro of these crank fellows" on .bestand I'll score you again. 'Twasa groat piece of impudence on your part to ail Judge Davis on thu stand without '(insulting me." Upon thc hypothetical case put by Mr. scoville Guiteuti was pronounced Insane jy tho following physicians: Dr. Charles II.

The first regular session of the Forty evcutb Congress began to-day, and holli [louses wore called to order at noon. In thu House lilli) members, answered o the roll call, only two members being ibsciit. The vote for Speaker was as ollows: Koifer 148. Randall 129, Ford I; necessary to a choice 14.1. Messrs. .\ilkerstin and Paul, Virginia Readjus ers, voted for Kui fer. To thc great relief of thc Democr . s, vho feared the contrary, from the threat if the Republicans, * Mr. Dibble, of ,;outh Carolina, was seated to-day, as veil as the other Representatives whoso eats were contested. When Messrs. Chalmers and Wheeler had taken tho >ath, after a parliamentary skirmish, in vbich Mr. Robeson, of New Jersey, had rankly admitted that they were entitled in their certificates of election to admis i?n, Mr. Calkins, Republican, of In Hana, after reciting the peculiar circum stances of Mr. Dibble's case, offered a ?solution that Mr. Dibble's certificate of .lection and all the papers, ?fcc, be re erred to thc election committee, with nstructions to report na n??!? SJS f>?Acu sable os to the right of either Mr. Dibble ir Mr. Mackey to thc seat, and that oi lier bc sworn in us the report ?hould re lommcnd. After having Mr. Dibble's :cr: i licite read, Mr. Calkins said that it ceiled that in pursuance of thc provis ons of the Constitution an election bad icen held to fill tho vacancy caused by he' death of the former representative, t uv.-, plain, he said, that if there was no ?acancy no power existed in thc Clover lor to order an election. Mackey may nive been elected or O'Connor" The ueslion ns to the existence of a vacancy ras not determined, and ought not to be letermined, until the House could in ves igate the matter. This was entirely a icw question, and, while he could not hercGiro find the law on it, he quoted rom Gushing'* Manual in support of his hcory. Secondly, he staled a view rhich might be takcu ol' th- caso if Mr. ubblc was seated. He was herc by vir ile of an independent election, bo took is sent, and if Mackey was thereafter eclarcd elected in 1880, it would bo im possible fur thc latter to contest ibo neut s Mr. Dibble was not his cou. cw litor. Ie urged the House to make n just prc eilent which would endure unquestioned. Mr. Ilrowne, Republican, of Indiana, ranted to know how it differed fromoth r cases where person? were admitted on rrtificatcscf election. It was ridiculous j say thit Mr. Dibble couldn't be un sated if Mackey was declared elected II 1880. lu such case there would have cen no vacancy, and consequently Mr. Dibble could be ousted as a? '"truder tod Mackey seated. Thc Gow.?or had x few montlis before sent in the certW cate of Mr. (/Connors election when Mr n c?nno,.:, ! and Ur Dibble was fleeted. HU er- leutkds ba? ?lated tba. heaney had edited on ??y?*^.g? the number holding the previous ie fi cate, rhe Governor could .... shirk . Lhl* dutv. He insisted upon Mr. IMO Lie's right to be ?worn in. He had seen h enough of precedents formed for party , emergencies winch reacted on thc,, makers. He intended to follow only Ins , [jwn iense of justice and right ?bis , matter. - , After this strong argument from the Republican -ide Mr. hniw, who had prepared a spei ch . moved to lay Mr. Cal kin's motion on thc table, which motton was agreed ; . wily a couple of dozen Irrccouciablc-J ? ?ting in thc negative. Mr Calkins eioleavoreJ to put oil the ?wearing until Monday, but withdrew UU motion upon pressure from Ins own Ol -, and Mr. D.bl.lc wa- daly ?worn in. The programme telegraphed last night was exactlv carried out by the Stalwarts, but the prec?Jeiits were too much for them. , ,., . , Mackev to night says bc did not h pc for much", but he boasts that he will have the-eat in thre< month*, the tune be allows for the c ?test. Messrs. Chai mer- and Wheeler, he declares, will go with Mr. Pibb'.e. Hy that time Calkins, lie says will b< chairman ot the elections committee, and the committee will con tinue no Democrat* whose seats haye be. tt in the least doubt. He thinks he ha- a -ure th::.;.' ol :t. Mr. Dibble thinks otherwise. He has the best Democratic lawyers iii the House engaged in studying the ca-e. 'lhere waa II thing remarkable about thc opening dav. There was a g rou. cr.wd without and great confusion within. The President's message is expected to be read to morrow and it is predicted tba', i*. will be long and rather tame. It will recommend the abolition of internal revenue taxe- except only on spirits and tobacco. Rainey is expected to get a place un der McPherson, his successful competi tor for the Ile.n-o clerkship. Mackey predicts that Wallace will be badly beaten for the collectorsbip. Ile is going to see the President and tell him rough things about the ex-mar shal. Ile ..dmits telling people that Rainey was not a citizen of south Caro lina, and is generally busy settling old scores. A whole Hock <>f South Carolina Re publicans roosted here tonight, among them Taft, Johnston and Sain Lee. Taft -ay- hr- is endeavoring to have Sunday deliveries established throughout thc State, which scheme he has received en couragement in. Ile is also trying to secure another postofJice building or a renovation and improvement of the one now occupied, and additional carriers. To these good works he adds a mild campaign for Baldwin as collector. T. Ll. Johnston is here in his own in ter.st as collector and irani Lee to pur SU3 his contest with Col. Richardson. Republicans say that ii is impossible for Stdbrandto succeed against Aiken, as he is working to do, because he failed to get evidence in thc time allowed by law. Thc collectorsbip lies between John ston and Wallace as before estimated. The Cotton Crop, NEW
