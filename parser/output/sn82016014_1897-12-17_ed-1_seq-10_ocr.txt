The revision of the currency promised in the St. Louis platform has been giv en a start. The plan of the adminis tration has been embodied in a bill by Secretary Gage and is now before con gress and before the people. The title of the bill says that it is Intended to provide for the refunding of the national debt, for the establish ment of a redemption fund and a di vision of issue and redemption in the treasury of the I'nited States and to modify existing laws respecting na tional banks and for other purposes. The "other purposes" were explained by the secretary to the committee on banking and currency. He said: "The objects I have in mind in the series of provisions offered by me are four In number: "First To commit the country more thoroughly to the gold standard: re move so far as possible doubts and fears on that point and thus strengthen the credit of the United States both at h'ime and abroad. "Second To strengthen the treasury in relation to its demand liabilities in which are included sreenbacks. treas uiy notes, the incidental obligation to r? aintain .on a parity, through inter-f-'ia::geability with gold, so far as may be necessary, the present large volume of silver certificates and silver dollars. "Third To do this in such a way as rt'it to contract the volume of circula tion in the hands of the people. "Fourth To take an initial- step to ward a system of bank notes issues without the conditional deposit of pub lic bonds as security therefor." This statement may be fairly taken as an embodiment of the views of the president. It is plain and easily under stood. First of all in importance in the new currency plan is to "commit the coun try more thoroughly to the gold stand ard." This may reasonably be con strued to mean, fixing the gold stand ard so firmly that there can never be any escape from it. The first step in this direction is the proposition for redeeming the silver currency and the silver certificates in gold. The desire is expressed that this shall be done in some way. not very clearly set forth, which shall not result in any contrac tion of the volume of circulation. It is proposed by the secretary that the whole business of issuing money and control of the volume of currency be turned over to the banks, and they are offered certain inducements to maintain an issue adequate to the needs of the people. These conditions the secretary seems to have no doubt they will accept. AVhile the bill provides for the re tirement of the greenbacks, Mr. Gage does not refer to that feature either in the title of the measure or in his re marks before the committee. - He has kept that part of the matter in the background as effectually as did the president in his message. There can be little doubt, however, that it will re ceive an ample airing in the halls of congress. That section of the bill which pro vides that outstanding coin bonds be redeemed in bonds payable specifically in gold, is likely to defeat the measure, as it stands, unless the temper of con gress has changed greatly since Mr. Cleveland's incumbency. 

FECPLE YOU HEAR OF. The estate of the late Neal Dow will amount to $450,000. President McKinley has accepted an Invitation to be the orator of the com mencement exercises of the Ohio Wes leyan university next June. Mrs. FJitoh, the proprietor of the fa mous F.litch garden in Denver, drives around over the city every day in a car ri. se pulled by an ostrich. The eightieth birthday of Professor Theodor Mommsen. the eminent Ger man historian, was celebrated with a grand kommers by the Berlin univer sity students. Professor ilommsen re ceived many congratulations by letter and wire. The gold watch of E'lgar Allen Poe is now in the possession of R. W. Al bright of Fort Madison. Iowa, and its history is characteristic of the check ered career of the poet. He had been in debt to Mr. Albright's brother, a merchant tailor, and gave several notes in settlement, together with the watch in trust. "Edgar A. Poe" is engraved on the gold cap inside. "When a child of 5 years John Wana Tnaker assisted in making- brinks, get ting a few cents a day. His first step toward fortune was in the days when, (us office boy, he saved money enough to start in business for himself. He worked as assistant in the office until he had climbed up to $9 per week, and then, seeing that he could get no more, he bought a little stock of cheap furni ture and started to be a merchant. The supreme court of the German em pire in Leipzig has just spoken the last word in the lawsuit over the inheri tance of Emin Pasha's property. The claims of the widow of the Turkish general, Hakki Pasha (who had mar ried in the meantime), to have been the wife of Emin, and who, therefore, claimed a portion of his property, are declared to be unfounded. Therefore, Frida Schmitzer, the explorer's daugh ter, has come into possession of all that he left. As another consequence of this decision, the papers and letters of Emin Pasha, announced some time ago for publication, will soon appear. 

GLOBE SIGHTS. (From the Atchison Globe.) Some men have as little sense about money matters as widows. Compliment some men, and they will consider that there was nothing else to say. If a woman is sick, and you want her to recover, don't tell her friends that she is sick. I If we go to hell, we hope to find a lot of practical jokers there. We have al ways hated a practical joker. No difference how rotten a story is at this time of the year, it goes if it has something about Christmas in it. We fail to see why a man should be proud of rich or distinguished kin. The relationship never gets him anything. If you are poor you are proof against some of the ills of people who have a little money; attorneys' fees, for in stance. There is something wrong with a young man who has to buy a second dress suit. ' One good suit ought to marry him off. This is the season when those too old to enjoy the healthful exercise of coasting, get all the exercise they need in dodging those who do coast. You hear men speak of certain things as an "appetizer." Men do not need an "appetizer." We all eat too much, and what we need is something to dull the appetite. It has always been the style for Wo men to carry pocket books, but of late years so many women are taking care of themselves that it is becoming 'the style to carry money in them. We have often wondered that some smart child, finding the chimney very small, does not spend her money on a bottle of anti-fat for Santa Claus. The mothers should spring this story Writing letters for Santa Claus, and putting them into the stove, has lost its favor. PENNY CAPITALISTS. New York Children of tho Poor En couraged to Save by Provi dant Funds. New York, Dec. IT. The Penny Provi dent system inaugurated in this city about nine years ago has grown to enorm ous proportions, and good results are ap parent, especially on the poverty-stricken East side. A casual visitor to the neighborhood Guild, on Delancey street, one evening last week found the room crowded with eager children, each carrying a small book, and all impatiently waiting for the striking of a gong that was to be the signal for them to form in line and make their de posits. It happened to be the banking hour. Each little depositor expected to increase his or her bank account by a sum that might range from 5 cents up to possibly 2j or 50 cents. Each was a cap italist on a very small scale, to be sure, but still a capitalist and a bank depositor, with a real bank book to show for it. All the component concerns are known as stamp stations and are nearly 350 in num ber. There are now nearly 65,000 depositors, of whom more than two-thirds are bright eyed and thoughtful boys and girls, many of them the offspring of poor immigrants. The Penny Provident folk do not conduct a banking business, but merely a school to teach the young the benefit to be de rived from harmless self-denial. According to its last report the Penny Provident fund htis $3l,3U5.44 in net de posits. In IMA) the deposits aggregated less than $6,000. 

PLACE FOR GORMAN. To be President of a Business Corpor ation Formed by Croker. Lakewood. N. J., Dec. 17.

Mr. Croker has de termined to launch a giant business cor poration of the fidelity-surety sort, with headquarters in New Y'ork. It will begin operations about January 1. and there will be a pipe line of perfect sympathy be tween this new company and Tammany Hall. Senator Gorman is cast for the presidency of this company and will, it is believed, accept the role, which will carry with it a position of prominence in Tam many politics. Gorman will, in the event of his acceptance, move to New York at the close of his term in the senate. In 1900 he will be the New Y'ork candidate for the presidency.

O Gant at Cowgill, Mo. Kansas City, Dec. 17. Dr. S. G. Gant, Manager of the University Medical col lege football team, had a narrow escape from a serious injury and per.iaps death while visiting his old home in Cow'gill. Mo., Sunday. The cause of the acci dent was a massive, old-fashioned fold ing bed. The doctor had been in the bed but a few moments when the heavy top lurched forward drawing" the occupant toward the wall. The doctor's sister heard the heavy scraping sound and ran to the room to assist her brother. She arrived in time to save his life, but not to prevent him from being severely bruised. The top of the bed caught him by the neck and nearly strangled him. Members of the family hastened to the room and pried the t ed apart. Dr. Gant is being at tended by Dr. Jabez Jackson. TO HAVE THE TROLLEY. Rich Cottagers of Newport Unable to Stem the Demand for Public Transportation Facilities, Newport, R. I., Dec. 17. The cottagers of Newport object to street railroads, but the residents, despite the fact that the summer residents support the place, have thus far ignored their wishes. It is now proposed to run a trolley line from Fall River to Newport. Three towns in Rhode Island connecting Newport with Fall River viz., Tiverton. Portsmouth and Middletown held the key to the situ ation, and their officials were appealed to by Newport's millionaire summer resi dents to prevent Newport from being in vaded by excursionists. Their appeals, however, were unheeded, and today the town of Portsmouth, where Cornelius Vanderbilt owns one of the finest farms in this section of the country, granted a franchise to the road. The principal objectors were Mr. Vanderbilt and his friend, Henry A. C. Taylor, a New York millionaire. By a singular coincidence the announce ment was made after the vote of the town council of Portsmouth today that Mr. Vanderbilt had given $500 and Mr. Taylor $150 toward the building fund for a par sonage for the Christian church of that town.
