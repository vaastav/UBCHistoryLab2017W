T1IH KKK: OMAHA. Fill DA V. nECEMNEK 10. 10i:, 5 ASKS A DISAVOWAL ! OF ANCOM ATTACK Washington Sends Note to Vienna Demanding Reparation for Americans Lost on Liner. ASSURANCES ALSO REQUESTED WASHINGTON. Dec. 9. The United States has sent to Austria Hungary a note asking for a dis avowal of the submarine attack upon the Italian liner Ancona, assuraances that such an act will not be repeated, some degree of punishment for the commander of the submarine and reparation for the American lives lost. The communication started by ca ble yesterday from the State depart ment to Ambassador Frederick C. Penfleld at Vienna, who was In structed to hand It to the Austro Hungarian minister of foreign af fairs, Baron Burlan. Word of the delivery of the note had not been re ceived by the department tonight. Terms Ar Firm. Friendly but firm terms. It Is said, characterize the document, which la un derstood to make a particular point of prompt assurances for the future safety of American Uvea. Austria-Hungary haa never informed the United States whether the commanders of ita submarines had been given instructions similar to those which the German government gave to its commanders after the Lusitania trag edy. It la understood the note referred par ticularly to the charge that shells from the submarine killed or wounded some passengers on the Ancona after it had 1 alted and asked for an explanation on that point. In dispatching the note Secretary Lan sing acted with the approval of President Wilson. It Is stated authoritatively that the document, which is described as being comparatively brief and decidedly vigor ous in tone, was so drafted as to attempt a settlement of the controversy at once, without bringing on a series of communi cations such as followed the sinking of the Lusltanla. Situation Grave. High officials are said to be of the opln Ion that the situation is one which calls for grave consideration, the state of af fairs having become more complicated since the note was dispatched by repeti tions of attacks on American oil-carrying vessels in. the Mediterranean, presumably by Austrian submarines. News that the note had been sent came as a complete surprise to official Wash ington, the reports which emanated from the state department early in the week being that no positive and corroborated evidence as to what actually had oc curred when the Ancona went down had been received. It was satd that the re ports received were fragmentary, con flicting or contradictory, and that until a reply to the Inquiries submitted to Austria-Hungary was received. It was probable that no communication would be sent to Vienna. Definite Data Rerelred. Tonight it was suggested In some quar ters that Information of a moat' con clusive nature had come to Socretary Lansing, probably late Monday night, and that it had been decided then that the protest should go forward imme diately. Whether Ambassador Penfleld had transmitted the reply of the Vienna foreign office to the list, of queries sub mitted by the United States could not be ascertained. The belief prevails, however, that the state department had received answers or some sort to the queries. In the In quiry Austria-Hungary was asked, among other things, whether a warnine shot had been fired before the ship was shelled, whether time was given the passengers to get to a place of safety and after it had come to a standstill and be fore the torpedo that sank it waa launched.' The Auatro-Hungarlan em bassy here had not been advised tonight that the Inquiry had been answered and it was said that the Italian ambassa dor, who had transmitted much Infor mation upon the sinking of the Ancona, had not furnished the United States with anything additional. , Dr. Crell'a Deposition. . The Ancona was sunk in the Mediter ranean sea on November 9, while bound from Naples for New York. The only testimony of a native American survivor cf the liner before the department Is In a deposition by Dr. Cecils Greil of New York. In her deposition Dr. Greil asserts specifically that the liner was torpedoed while the men, women and children in the' cabin and steerage were scrambling to get into the small bpats. The depart ment has teen inclined not to accept this single statement as positive proof unless corroboration was received from some source. Much weight was given, however, to what Pr. Greil had to say. Her testi mony waa considered of so much Im portance thst she was taken to Rome, where she told her story to Ambassador Page. A report of this conversation reached the State department recently. After the Inquiry of the United States had been befors the Vienna foreign of fice several days Ambassador Penfleld - reported that more time was desired in which to frame a reply. Late last week Secretary Lansing Instructed the ambas sador to urge a prompt reply. What Note Seta Forth. The American note, it is understood, sets forth that the United Kingdom can not believe that the commanders of Aus trian submarines have committed sn al leged act of lawleaness except under a misapprehension of orders Issued by the Austrian naval authorities. It is de clared that under methods of warfare such as those employed In the sinking of the Ancona it practically is impossi ble under such circumstances to remain within the rules of fairness, justice and humanity. The principles of humanity and Justice which were championed in notes to Ger many are understood to also be called strongly to the attention of the Austro Hungarian government in this communi cation. Warning before submarine at tacks is insisted upon. While every op portunity Is said to be left for an amica ble reply, the belief prevails in usually well informed circles that the communi cation is more vigorous than any dis patched to Germany while Aha contro versy with that country over the con duct of submarine warfare was in prog-re-i. Tke Aaalrlaa tea t loa. No Intimation could be obtained tonight whether the United Stales had determined ahe'Jter any "misinformation" appeared in the statements of the occurrence which have been issued by the Austrian admiralty. The Austrian contention waa 4a, v warning aoot waa fired, that the

At the end of that period It was claimed another vessel appeared and the subma rine submerged and torpedoed the Ancona, which sank at the end of another pe riod of forty-five minutes. It was denied that any lireboats were fired at, but It was said that some of the loss of life was caused by failure of the commander of the Ancona to act promptly. The Italian statement on the subject alleged that no warning was given before the submarine started shelling the ship, which immediately came to a stop and that shells were exploded on the decks of the vessel and In the lifeboats, kllling- and wounding many passengers. Just how many American lives were lost on the Ancona never has been defi nitely established. It is known that sev eral naturalized citizens were lost. Re ports on this point, however, have been so conflicting that the State department never has been able to compile an ac curate list. The text of the American note, it was said tonight, will be given out for publication In the morning papers of Friday. Asquith Replies to Question Regarding Peace Negotiations LONDON, Pec. 9.
