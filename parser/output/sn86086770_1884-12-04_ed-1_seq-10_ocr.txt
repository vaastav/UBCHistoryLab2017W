jiPLEMEIT The President’s Message Washington, D. C. t Deo. I,IWM. To the Conf/resH of the.

Nothing could more strikingly illustrate the temper of the American citizen; his love of order, and his loy ally to the law; nothing could more signallr demonstrate the strength and wisdom <>f our political institutions. Right years have elapsed since a controversy concerning the result of the national election sharply called the attention of congress to the necessity of providing more pre cise and definite regulations for counting .the electoral vote. * It is of the greatest Importance that this ques tion he solved before conflicting* claims to the presidency shall again distract the country, and I am persuaded that by the people at large arty of the measures of relief thus fur proposed would he preferred to continued inaction.

RELATIONS WITH ALL FOREIGN POWERS continue to be amicable. With Belgium a con vention has been signed, whereby the scope of the present treaties have been so enlarged os to secure to citizens of either country within the jurisdic tion of the Other, equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and alienation of property. A trade murk treaty has also been concluded. The war between C’hiii and Bern is at an end. For the arbitration of the claims of American citizens who during ita continuance suffered through the acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. The state of hostility between France and China continues to be an crnbuitowing feature of our eastern relations. Tte Chinese government has promptly adjusted and paid the claims of American citizens, whose property was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton. I renew the recom mendation of my last annual message, that the Canton Indemnity fund be returned to China Thu true interpretation of (ha recent treat v with that country permitting restriction of Chinese Immigration is likely to again Is) the subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously question *d whether the statute parsed at the last session, does not violate the treaty rights of certain Chinese who left this country with return et rtltl cates valid under the old law, and now seem to he debarred from landing, from lack of certifi cates required by the new. Tlw ncctil purcbiucH by the United of a .art,"- tradlnn tied, heretofore under the (thinew lias considerably enhanced our commercial importance in tho east.

Pursuant to the advice of the senate at the last session, I recognized the Hag of the in'ema tionul association of the Congo as that of a friendly government, avoiding in so doing any prejudgment or conflict in the territorial claims in that region, subse quently in the execution of the expressed wish of congress, appointed a commercial agent for the t ougo basin. The importance of the rich prospective trade of the ( Cngo valley has led to the general convlotion that it should be open to ail uiit ions upon equal terms. The interna ional conference for the consideration of this subject, called by the emperor of Germany, is now in session at IVrlln Th* re are delegates in at tend ance in behalf of the United Sin t*s. and of the results of the conference |you will Ih> duly ad vised.

The government of Japan stands ready to grant us entensivo grounds at Toklo whereon to erect a suitable building for the lega Hon court house and gail, and similar privilege* can probably be secured in China and Peru The owning of such premises wsuld not only effect a large saving of the present rentals hut would per mil of the due assertion of extra territorial rights in those countries and would the lteller serve to maintain the dignity of the Called States. The failure of congress to make appropriation for our representation at Aatonoinos Court of the Khedive, has proved a serious embarrussmvßt in our intercourse with Egypt, and in view of the necessary Intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to the participation of this government as one of the t reaty powers in all matters of admin istration, there affecting the rights of foreigners. 1 advise the restoration of the agency and consul* e.Ve general at Cairo on it* former basis, Ido not conceive it to b* the wish of coiiaivs* that the United States should withdraw altogether from the honorable position they have hitherto held, with respect to the Khedive, or that citizens or this republic residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter lie without the aid and protection of a competent representative.

It offers me pleasure to say that OCR INTERCOURSE WITH GREAT BRITAIN continues to lie of a most friendly character. Tin* government of Hawhii has Indicated its will ingness to coniiue for seven years the piovis ions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such n cxmtinusm*e, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of states should in my judgment, be favored. The revolution in Hayti against the established government has terminated While it was in progress it became necessary to enforce our neutrality laws by instituting proceedings against individuals and vessels charged with their m fringement. These revolutions wen* in all can s successful. Much anxiety has lately been dis piaycJ by various Eurooean governments, und especially by the government of Italy, for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art. It is well to consider whether ihe vessel discriminations in favor of the importations of American artists abroad is not likely to result, as they themselves neem very generally to bedev* jj may. in the practical expulsion of our painters ana sculptors from the rich Helds for observa tion. study and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed. ‘ There is a prospect that the long pending rm is ion of the foreign treaties of Japan may i e ,*ou clu cd at anew conference to be held at Towio While this government fully recognizes the equal and Indepeudcul station of Japan in the com mu nity of nations, it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as Jai*as may be dispose*! to offer in furtherance of a uni form policy of intercourse with western nations Turing (be past year the increasing good w ill between our own government and that of Mexico has l**eu variously manifested. The treat v of commercial reciprocity concluded Ju’y Y), iski. has l**en ratified and awaits the necessary tariff legislation of congress to lieconic effective. The legislation will, 1 doubt not. lie among the first to claim your attention A full treaty of commerce, navigation and consular rights is much to be desired, and such a treaty. I have rea son to believe, the Mexican government stands ready to conclude. Some emtmrransmeol has been occasioned by the failure of congress at its last session to provide means for the due execu lion of the treaty of July 29th, 1882. for the re survey of the Mexican boundary. and the re loca Cion of boundary monuments A CANAL, RAILWAY AND TELEGRAPH. With the republic of Nicaraugua a treaty has been conclud v. which authorizes t he construction by the United Suites of a canal, railway and tel egraph line across the Nicarauguan territory By terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river San Juan, ns well as the lake Nicaraugua. an inland sea forty miles in width, are to constitute a part of the projected enterprise. This covers for actual canal purposes seventeen miles on the Pacific side, and thiny-felx miles on the Atlantic to the United States, whose rich territory on the Pacific is for the ordinary purposes of commerce | practically cut off from communication by the ' water with the Atlantic ports. The political and commercial advantages of such a project can t scarcely be over estimated. It is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and * liberality of its provisions will command uni versal approval at home and abroad. The death of our representative at Russia, while at Ids post at Ht. Petersburg, afforded to the imperial government a renewed opportunity to testify its sympathy in a manner befitting the intimate friendliness which has ever marked the intercourse of the two countries. The course of this government in raiding its representative at Bangkok to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friend ship, and augurs well for our enlarged interior The Siamese government has presented to the United Slates a commodious mansion and grounds for the occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that by Joint resolution congress attest its appre ciation of this generous gift. SPAIN. This government has more than once been called on of late to take action in fullfiiiments of international obligation toward Spam agitation m the island of Cuba hostile to the Spanish crown having been fermented by persons abusing the sacred right* of hospitality which our territory affords. The officers of the government have be* n instructed to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions of our neutrality laws at Key West and other parts near tin- Cuban coast i am happy to say that in only one instance where these precautionary measures were successfully eluded the offenders, w hen found in offr territory were subsequently tried and convicted The growing need of a close relation-hip of inter course and traffic between the Spanish Antilles and their natural market in the United States has : fi and to the adoption in January la-t of a com i mercial agreement looking to Hint mu). ! This agreement has been superseded by a more | carefully framed and comprehensive convention. w hich I shall submit to the senate for approval 1 It has lieen the aim of the negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of production curled under the Mag of either country, as to make intercourse between Cuba and Porte Rico ami ours** Ives scarcely less Intimate than the com mercial movement in our domestic ports and to in | sure the rerr val of the burdens on shipping in the | Spanl-h 1 idias, of which in the past our ship i owners ami ship masters have o often had cause I to complain. The negotiation of this convention has. for a time, postponed the prosecut’on of certain ! claims of our citizens w hich were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late SpanLh- Americ&n claims commission, and which we, therefore, remitted to diplomatic channels for adjustment. The speedy settlement of these claims will now he urged by this government. Negotiation* for a treaty of commercial recip rocity with the Domnican republic have been successfully concludes and the result will shortly I** laid before th senate. Cert in questions be tween the United States and (he Ottoman em pire still remain unsolved. Complaints In be half of -ur citizens are not satisfactorily adjust ed. The Porte has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are entitled bv existing conventional stipulations and the revision of the tariffs as un accomplished The final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet been reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement, which will provide the means of re-examining the Fa* a cas awards, in conformity with the expressed de •-ire of congress, and which will recognize the jus tice of certain claims preferred against Venezuela. THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN COMMISSION appointed by authority of the act of congress of July, 1 ns |. will soon proceed to Mexico. It haft been furnished with instructions which will be laid liefore you. They contain a t late me nt of the general policy of the government for enlarging its commercial intercourse with American I states. The commissioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by hoi lug conferences in the principalities with merchants and others interested in Central and South Amer i lean trade INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN CONFERENCE I Lately convened in Washington 'upon the In vßation on the part of t he Unite and Staid, waacom posed of representatives fron twenty-five na . lions The conference concluded its liborson the first of November.

I The formal report of the transact ions of this con ference will be he re-after tianamittid to con gress. This government is in frequent receipt of iuvi tattoos from si ales to participate in INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS, often of great interest and Importance Occupy mg. us we do, an advanced position m the world's production, and aiming to secure a profitable share lor our industries in the general competi tive markets, it is a nv-vtcr of serious concern that tin* want of means for participation in these exhibit* should so often exclude our producers from the advantages eujoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of congress was drawn to the formal invitations in lids rera* and tendered by the governments of Kng land, Holland. Belgium, Germany and Austria. The exeeulivii has in some instances appointed honorary commissioner*. This is, however, a most unsatisfactory expedient, for without some provision to meet the necessary working ex(>rnses of a commission, it can effect little ur uomi g in behalf of exhibitors. An international inventors exhibition is to be held In Lon- on next May. This will cover a field of special Importance in whim our country holds foremost ran . But the executive is at present powerless to organize a p-oper rapresentation of our vast national interests in this direction 1 have in several previous messages referred to this subject. It seems to me that a statute giving to the executive general discretionary authority to a cept such invitations and to appoint honorary com mi. si oners without a salary, and placing at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses, would be of great public utility. 

COLLISIONS AT SKA. This government has receive I official notice that the revisisi international regulations, for pre venting collisions at seu. have been adopted b> all the leading marittne powers except tne United Hiatus. and came into force on the (list of Septem ber last. For the one protection of our shipping interests, the provisions or our statutes should at o*ce Ik* bn.ughi into proper relations with these I regulations. I The question of securing to authors, composers i artists COPY RIGHT PRIVILEGES. In this country, in return for reciprocal rights abroad as one that may justly %■ ha linage your at lentiou. It is true that u convention w ill be nec essary for fully accomplishing this result, but un til congress shall fix the e u*nt to which foreign holders of copyright rhall be herepmi cged.lt lias been deemed inadvisable to negotiat * such convention for this reason. The United Slates were not represented at TH* RECENT CONFBRENCE AT BERNE I recommend that the scope of neutrality laws of the United States be so enlarged as to cover all patent acm of hostility co-nnutted in our tern tory, and aimed against the pence of a friendly nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fliting out j *f arnnd exped tions, and restrict the snip rent of explosives though enactments in the latter respect were not framwd with regard to interna I tional obligations but simply for protection of passenger travel, an these statutes o meet spec i lal emergencies that have already ar sen other emergencies have arisen since a modem mgenui Cy supplies means for organizaiion of tostPitu-e w ithout upen resort to armed vessels or to fill blistering parties. I see no reason why overt preparations in this country fori he commission of criminal acts such as are here under co'>sidtra lion sh-uld not alike be punishable, whether such act . are in’ended to be committed in our country or in a foreign country, with which we are si P**ace. The prompt ami thorough treatment of this question is one of which intimately covers i the nail ns honor OUR EXISTING NATURALIZATION UIG j also need revision. Those sections relating to person* r siding within tie limits of the United i Btates in J7W* and IT9S. have now only a histotica j interest Section 21.173. recognising th** citizen ship of the children of naturalized parents.

There art * special provisions of law favoring the 1 nsturallz vtmn of those who serve in the army or ! ~n merchant vessels, while no similar privileges I aru granted those w io serve in the navy or tua | rmt ? corps. An uniform rule of naturalization suoh as the constitution contemplates should, i among other things, clearly define the status of I person* born within the United States, subject to a foreign power isec. UW\ and of minor children or fathers who have declared their intention of becoming citizens, but have failed to perfect th-ii naturalization It might l>e wise to provide for a tvnfral bureau of registry, wherein should In* fih'd aiith- niic transcripts of every rvcord ©f naturalization in the several federal and state courts, and to make provision also for the vaca tiou or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud bad been practiced upon the court by the applicant himself, or where he had re moved or forfeited his acquired citizenship A just and uniform law m this respect wou.d strengthen the hand* of the government in pro tecting ita citizen* Abroad, and would pave the * way for the conclusion ot treaties of naturaliza tion with foreign countries. THE DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE. The legislation of the lost session effected in the diplomatic and consuls, service certain changes and reductions which have been produc tive of embarrassments. The population and commercial activity of our country, are steadily on tne increase and ar. giving rise* to ne v vary lug and often r’elicate relatfonsnip with other countries. Our foreign establishment now eni brat***.-, nearly double the area of operations that it did twenty yt* a r ago, after the conferment of B UC a service within the limits of expenditures, is not, it teems to me, in accordance with true economy, and a community of sixty millions of people should be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign nations. A project for the reorganization of consular s*-r vice and fur recasting the scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction is now before you. If the limits of a short session will not allow its full consideration. I trust you will not fail to make a suitable provision for the present needs of th*- service. It has been customary to define is the appro priation acts the rank of each (ilplouMti*- office to wh‘ch salary is attached. I sugg&t mat tins course be abandon'd and that it lie left to the president, with the advice and consent of he senate, to fix, from tim* to time, the diplomatic gra e of the representative* of this government abroad as may seem advisable, provision being definitely made, however, as now, for the amount of salary attached lo the respective stations THE 

CONDITION OF OUR FINANCES and the Derations on the various branches of the public service which air- connected with the treasury department, are very fully discussed in the report of the secretary, ft appears that th ordinary revenues for Hie fiscal year ending June 30, IkM, were: From customs ' 195,007, WO.TC From Internal revenue I'il.Sßo 7j SI Fi oin all other sources 31,KWij;!i)T li."

The aggregate receipts were l*hs than those of the year previous by about $74.000 000. The falling off of revenue from cus toms made up marly $20,000 000 of this deficiency and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal taxa - tion. The secretary estimates the total receipts for the fiscal year which will end June 30,1885, at $330,000,000, and the tola! expenditures at $290, '-20 201. in which are included the interest on the debt and the amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus lor the entire year of about $39,000,000. THE VALUE OF EXPORTS from the United States to foreign countries during the y ear vndlng June 30, 1884, was as follows l> 'incstic merchandise $724,964,852 Foreign merchandise 15,548.757 Total merchandise $740,518,600 Specie 67.881,883 Total exp >rts of merchandise and spe cie SBO7 616,00$ THE COTTON AND COTTON MANUFACTURES.

Cotton and manufactures of cotton 30.404.476 Hides and skins, other than fur skins 22,350,000 THE SILVER DOLLAR. 1 concur with the secretary of the treasury in rec impending the immediat* suspension of coin age of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver ce Mflcates. and this is a matter to which in for mer com inn ni cations 1 have more than once in voked the attention of the national legislature It appears that annually, for the past >ix y**a*-s, there nave beeuconei in compliance with the r*M| j rements oi the act of Feb 28. 1878. more than twenty -seven million ilv*-r dollars, and the number now coined is reported by the secretary to be nearly one hundred and eighty five million, whereof but little more than forty million, • r less than twenty-two per cent., are in actual circula tion. The mere exMenee oi this f ct. seem-to me to furnish of itself a *• pent argument tor the rep*-ill of the statute, wb . i ha* made such a fact possible, but then* • other und graver t onsideraiions that tend in the same direction. The secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the iv-uance of silver certificates oe suspended, silver is likely, at no distant day, to necome our sole metallic standard. The commercial llistnrhai ce and the impair ment of the national credit that would thus be occasioned can scare* ly be over estimated I hope that the secretary's suggestion r*‘ pe* iing the w ithdraw al from circulation of the one dollar and two-dollar notes will receive your appioval. It is likely that a considerable portion ot the sil ver now* ineumber’ng the vaults in the treasury might thus find its way into the currency. While TRADE DOLLARS navi ceased, for the present at least, lo be an ele ment of active disturbance in our currency sys tem, gome provision tliou’d be made for their surrender to the government, lu view of the circumstance* under which they were' coined, and of the fact that they have neve I uni a legal U*i and r quality. there should be offered for them ( nly a slight advarn e over their bullion value. Tin* seer* iary, in the course of his report, con siders the propriety of 

BEAUTIFYING THE DESIGNb OF OUR SUBSIDIARY SILVER COIN'S, and of so increasing their weight tliat they may b‘iir due ratio of value of the standard dollar. His conclusions lu this reg rd are cordially ap pn ft and lu my annual mesage of 1882. I recommended the abolition of alt excise taxes exempt tliose re lating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is n w renewed. In case these taxes shall be abolished, the revenues that will still remain to the government will, in my opinion, n* t *oly suf fice to m* et its reasonable" exp* nditur* a, tint w*ll afford a surplus large eu* ugh to permit uch tar iff reduction ns ninv seem to tn* o*ivisa!>le w hen the results of iveeni iev oue laws and commer cial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions * an he raott judiciously effected. Ot H roHEIGNTRAPS. One of the graved of the problems which ap peal to the wisdom* f c*‘ngress for solution is the OMcertuintMent of the mo I effective means of in creasing our foreign trade, and thus relieving ihe depression under which our Industries are now languishing. The secretary or the t easury n vise* that the duty of inv* stigatmg this subject te entrusted in. the first iusiance to a competent commissi* n Idle fully recognizing the considc'rations that may b* urged against this course, lam neverthe less -f the opinion, that on the w hole, no other would lie likely to effect speedUr and better re sults. That portion of the Secret ary'sre;*ort which concerns that condition oi* u shipping intervsts cannot fall to command your attention He em phatically recommends that as an incentive to the investment of Ante*icon csp'tal in American steamships, ike government !-hall by liberal payments for mail transportation, or otherwise, lend its active assistace to individual eoterpuse, and declares his belief that kil*-ss that ourse be I'lire-m and. . ur foreign ca> rv ing trade must remain as it re to-day, almost exclusively in thv hands of foreigners.' one phase of this subject is not especially prom Inent in view- of the repeal act of June 26, ISM, of all salutary provisions arbitrarily compelling American vesseu to carry iha mails to and from the United Slates Ah it is necessary to make pro visions to compensate the ow ners of such vessels for performing tkat service after April, 1885, it is hoped that the whole subj* ct w ill receive early consideration that will lead to tko enactment of such measures for the * evival of our merchant marine as the wisdom of congress may devise THE BONDS. The three per cent, b ends of the gorernnient to the amount of more than $100,000,000 have, since my last annual metaage, been redeemed by the treasury The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to a little over $300.000,000, about one fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking fund during the com ing year. As these bonds still continue the chief basin lor the circulation of the nation*! banks, the question how to avert the contraction of the currency cause# by their return merit, is one of constantly increasing importance. U seems to be general! j conceded that ths law governing this matter exacts from banka exces sive security and that in their present bond de posits a larger circulation than is now allowed mar be granted with safety. 1 hope that bill which pa—pd the senate at lan —ton permitting the issue of n*us equal to face value of deposit ed bonds, will commend itself to tl>e approval of ♦he bouse of representatives. IN TOE 

EXPENSES OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT the secret aiy reports a decrease of more than 50.000,000 of which a reduction of $5,600,000 was elT* cled in expenditures for rivers and harbors, and $-,500,000 in expenditures for the quarter master department. Outside of that department the annual expenses of ail the army bureaus proper, except possibly, the ordinance bureau, ore substantially fixed charges, which cannot Ik* materially diminished without a change in the numerical strength of the army. The expenditures in the quartermaster's de partment can readily he subjected to adminis trative discretion, and it is reported by the sec retary of war that as a result of exercising sucV discretion in reducing the number of draught ami pack animals in the army, the annual cost of supplying and caring lor such animals is now $l,lOB 085.00 less than it was in 1882. The reports of military commanders show that the last year has been notable for Its freedom from Indiac outbreaks. In defiance of the presi dents proclamation of Jnly Ist, IHM. certain in truders sought to make settlements in the Indian T. rritory. They were promptly removed by a detachment of troops, j During the past session of congress a bill to ! provide a Amiable fire proof building for the army medical museum, and the library of the surgeon general's office received the approval of the senate. A similar bill reported favorably to the house of representatives by one of Its committees, is still pending before | that body. It is hoped that , during the coming session the measure may l>e come a law, and thereafter immediate steps may \y* taken to secure a place of sate deposit for these valuable collections, now in a state of in.se ‘ entity. The funds with which the works for the IMPROVEMENT OF RIVERS AND HARBORS were prosecuted during the past year were de rived from the appropriations of the act of Au gusts, 1882, together wijh such few balances as were on hand from previous appropriations. The oalance in the treasury subject to requisi tion July Ist, 1883, was $10,921,619.55. The amount appropriated during the fiscal year 18Kt was $13,106,346*27. 1 he amount drawn from the treasury during i the fiscal year was $8,228,703.5-1. Leaving a balance * f $3,112,580.63 in the treas | ary subject to requisition July 1. 1881. COAftT DEFENSES. The secretary of war submits the report of | chief of engineers a* to Ihe practicability of pro reeling our important cities on the seaboard by onifications and other defences able to repel modern methods of attack. The time has now come wlu n such defences can be prepared with t **- confidence that they will not prove abortive, un i when the possible results of delay in making fuch preparations is seriously considered, delay seems in- xdisable. For the most important rit ie—-those whose destruction or capture would lie : h national humiliation- adequate defences, ia c usive of guns, may be made by the gradual ex- I enditure of |60,000~000, a sum much less than a victorious cm my could levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one tenth of that amount is asked to liegin the work, and I concur with the secretary of war in urging that it bo grant* and. The war department is proceeding with the conversion of iO-inch smooth-bore guns into 8 inch rides by lining the former with tubes of : forged or of cold wrought Iron. Fifty guns wifi le bus conv* rted wiilnn tlie year Tins, bon ever, does n.t obviate the necessity of providing ra**ans for the construction of gum of the highest power, but for the purposes of coast defense and ior the armament of war vessels. The r. port of the gun foundry board appointed April 2. 1883 in pursuance of the act of March 3, I was transmitted to congress in a special : message of February 8, 188-1. in my message of March 26, 1884, I called attention to the recom mendation of the board that the government should encourage the production of PRIVATE STEEL WORKS of the required material for heavy cannon, and that two government factories, one for the army h.u one for tho navy, should be established for the fabrication of guns of such material. No ac tion ba*iug ben taken, the board was subse quently reconvened to determine more fully the plan> ami estimates for carrying out its recoin meudaiion It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manu facturers in t is country who, ah hough not pro vided at present with the necessary plant are willing to construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the government for Ibe supply of the requisite material for the heaviest guns adapted to modern warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient magnitude,accom panied by a positive appropriation extending ever a series f years, shall be made by congress. All doubts as to th • feasibility of the plan being i tins removed, 1 renew my recommendation i bar such action be taken by con gress as will enable the government to construct its own ordinance upon its own te ntory and so to provide the armaments demanded bv considerations of naval safety and lion-. r. The report of the secretary of the navy txmbits the progress which has been made on TUB NEW 

STEEL CRUISERS authorized by the ads of August f*th, 1882, and March 3d, 1883. Of the four vessels under contract, one the Chicago, of 4,.’60 tons, is more than half finished. The Atlanta, of 3,000 tons, has been succ ‘ssfully launched, and her machinery is now filling. The Boston, also of 8,000 tons, is ready for launching and the Dolphin, a dispatch steam hi. of 1.500 tons, is ready tor delivery. Certain adverse * Title lams upon the assigns of these ends* rs are dlseusseti by the secretary, who <h M -ts that tne correctness of the conclusions, reach e i by the advisory board and by the department, I ) a* been demonstrated by recent development In ■ sh’D building abroad The machinery of the double turretted moni tors.

No work has bend**ne during the past yesr on their armor for lack of the neces sary appropriation. A fourth monitor, the ‘Monaunock,” still remains unfinished at tin* navy yard in California It Is recommended that early sb p he taken to complete these vessels und to provide also un arniairunt for the monitor Miantotn mah.

Tko general dr-signs, afi >f which arecal culated to meet th*- existing wants of the Service, are u*w v*ell advanced and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority. THE JEANETTE CREW. The act of congress, approved August 7th. 1882, authorized the removal to th*-United Stales ot the bodies or Lieut -Commander. O. W. DeLong, and his c mpaiiionkof the Jeannette expedition. The remains w* re taken from their grave in the Lena Delta in March, 1883. and w ere retained at Yakuesk until the foil*-wing winter, the season l>e ng too tar advanced to admit of their itnine diate transportation. They arrived at New York ♦February 20, 18M, where they were received with sun able honors. In pursuance of the joint resolution of congress, approved Fenruary 13, 188-1, a naval expedition w as fitted out for THE RELIEF OF ÜBCT. A. W OREKLEY. of the United Stales army, and of the party who had Ixn n engaged under his command id scienti fic observations at Lady Franklin Bay. Tb*- fieet consisted of the steam sealer “Thetis,” purchased in England; the *' Bear,'* purchased at St. Johns, New l oum land, and the ’ Alert,” which was generously provided Uv'the British government. I’reparaii ns lor the expepdion were promptly maae by the s*-cretary of the navy. Witu the ac tive co-operation of the secretary of war, com mander Ueo W. Coffin was placed in command of the “Alert," and Li**ul W. H Emery in com mand of the “Bear. ’ The * Thetis was In trusted to Uommauder Winfield 8. Bchi y, tc whom alto was assigned the superintendence ol the entire expedition. Immediately upon its arrival at Uoernavik the fleet began the dangerous u.vigaii l of Melville bay, and, in spite of every obstacle, reached Lit tleton Island on June 22d. a fortnight earlier man any vessel had before attained that point On the same day it crossed over to Ope Sabin**, where Lieut Greely and the other survivors of Ills party were dtscovei ed. After taking *>n board the living, and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July mh. They were appropriately received at Portsmouth, N H, ou August Ist, and a* New York on August Bth One of the bodies was landed at the former place, the o> hers were put ashore at Government i>laud. and, with the excep tion of one which was inferred in the national eeni eteiy.were forwarded to the dest mat ion s Indicated \y li lends The organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success. In this the mst of the state messages that I Khali have the honor to traocnU to the congress of the United Mates, I cannot too strongly urge pu its attention the duty of RESTORING OUR NAVY as rapidly as possible to the high siato of effi i ciency which formerly cliaractei ized it. as the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fan vied security may at any time be disturbed, it :s plain ibat Ibe policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by considerations of : use. economy of just regard lor our future trim quility and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of this republic. T he report of the postmaster-general acquaints you with the present condition aud needs of the 

POSTAL SERVICE. It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in rate of letter posi tugo us recommended In my message of Deceisbcr ivtl, and effected by trie set of March 31, PSH.j, has been much less than was generally auUcipoted. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon tlie belief that the actual falling off lu re receipt-, on letter postage tor the year immedia tely succeeding change of rate would be $3 .uou,- (KM), it has proved lo be only SS,f!7S.(K). Tula is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to former volume by natural Increases of sealed correspondence. I confidently repeat, therefore, the recommen dation of my last annual message, that rale postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wnerever payment of 3 cents is now requir ed by law The double rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in ope ation, and it appears that at these offices that the in crease of taxes upon local letters defrays cost nos only of its ewu collection and delivery, but of tlie collection and delivery of other mall matter, and tins is an inequality that ought not longerezigt. 1 approve the recommendations of the Postmaster General that the ( mt of weigh' in the rating of first class mailer should be one ounce instead of one half ounce us it now is in view of the statistics furnished by the department It, may be well doubted whether the change would result iu any less revenue; if nut, that it would greatly promote tlie convenience of the public, is beyond dispute Thefiee delivery system has been lately ap plied to five cities, aud the total number of offices in which it is now in operation is one haudred and fifty nine Experience shows that its adoption under proper conditions is equally an accommo dation to the public and an advantngcTo the FO-'al service being more than self sustaining, and for the reason urged by the post master-general may properly be extended. It Istlie opinion of that officer that it is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in deal ng with letters In free delivery offices may be secured by payment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might be made effe live by the employment of a special stamp whose cost should be commensurate with tli“ expense of the extra service. In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to outstrip the gov eminent mail carriers by affording for prompt transmission of letters better facilities than have hitherto been at tke command of the post office It nas always been the policy of the government to disc mrago such enterprises, and in no be'ter way can that policy lx* maintained than in sup plying the public withtke most efficient mail service and that with due regard to its own best in terests, can lie furnished for its accommota tiou. FEES. Tlie attorney general renews the recommenda tion contained in his report of last year touching fees of witnesses and jorors. He favor* a radi cal change in the fee bill, tlie adoption of a sys tem by which a torneys and marshals of tlie United States should be compensated solely by salaries and the erection by the government of a penitentiary for tlie confinement of offenders against its laws. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT, Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the interior department, tlie reports of its secretary present an infi resting suirtmary. Among the topics deserving particular attention 1 refer you to his observations respecting our In ilian affairs, the preemption aud timber culture acts, the failure of railroad companies to take litle to lauds granted by the government, and tlie operations of the pension offices, the patent, office, the census bureau and tlie bureau of edu cation. Allusion has been mails already to the circumstance that boih, as i etween the d'fferent Indian tribes mid ns between the Indiana and the whites, the past year lias been one of unbroken peace, lu this circum stance the president is glad to find a justification for the policy of the government in dealing with the Indian question, and a confirmation of the views w Inch w ere fully expressed in Ids first com muuication to the 47th congress. The sicre ary urges a now enactment of the statute for the pun ishment of crimes committed on Indian reserva tions, and recommends the passage of the bill now pending in the house of representatives for the purchase of a tract of IK.ooil square miles from the Sioux reservation, Doth these meas ures are won by of approval. 1 concur with him also, uu advising THE 

REPEAL OF THE PREEMPTION LAW, the enactment of statute*, involving the present legal complications touching lapsed gn.nus to railroads and the funding of the debt of the sev eral Pacific railroads undar such guaranty as shall insure it* ultimate payment, the report of the Utah commission will be read vith interest, it discloses tlie result of recent legislation looking lo the prevention AND 

PUNISHMENT OF POLYGAMY In that territory I still believe that if that ab ominable practice can be suppiessed by law, it can only lie by the most radical legislation, consistent with restraints of the constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that congress assume absolute political control of the territory of Utah, and provide for the appsinlmeut of a COllimi sion with such governmental powers as iu us judgment may justly snd wisely be put into their hands. iu the course of this communication reference lias more than once been made to thepeiicyof tins government as regards tbs EXTENSION OF OUR FOREIGN’ TRADE. It seems proper to declare the general prin copies that shout', m my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction. The ma.n con ditions of the problem may be thus stated: VVe are a people of mechanical pursuits, and fertile 111 invention, aud we cover a vast extent of ter ritory. rich iu agricultural product*, mil iu nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture We have a system of productive establishment* mot i man sufficient to supply our demands. Ttu wages of labor are now here also so great, and the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their persons! comfort Mini tlie development of those higher morals and intellectual qualities tiiat go to the making of ji.od citizens. Uur system of tax ami tariff legislation i* yield ing a revenue which is In excess of tlie present needs of the government. These are elements Lout which it is sought to devi e a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing tbecondi lion of our working men, our merchant marine slinll lx* raised from its enfeebled”condition ami new markets provided for that sale beyond our (.irdei Kof Hie man Hold fruits of our industrial c-iiicipf i~e. Til* problem is complex, aud can be solved by m single measure of innovation or reform. The countries of the American continent, and tlie ad jacent islands, are for the United States the nut Dial market of supply and demand it is from them that we should obtain wliat we do nut pro duce, or do not produce iu sufficiency, and it i* lo (hem that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills and our workshops should How, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition. Your patiis of policy seem to point to this end. First—A series of reciprocal commercial trea ties with countries of America, which shall foster between us and 'hem an unhampered movement of trade The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce, in return lor the admis sion free, or under a favored scheme of duties, of our products. The benefits of such exchange to apply on those goods carried under the flag of the puttie* to the contract Tii* removal on both sides from vessels to be se privileged, of all ton nage dues and national inuxirts, so that their ves sels may ply unhindered between IL* ports and those of tlx other contracting parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade. Tlie removal or reduction of the burden on the exported products of those countries com ing within the benefits of the treaties, aud tlie avoidance of the technicalities, restrictins and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered. Secondly.—The establishment of tlie consular service of the United Slates on a sa'arled footing, permitting the relinquishment of consular fees not only us respects vessels under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty of nations currying goods, entitled to the benefit of tbe treaties. Thirdly —The enactment of measures to favor the construction aud maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United Slates. Fourthly.—The establishment of a uniform currency basis for the countries of America, so tiiat the coined products of our mines may cir culate in equal terms throughout the whole gy* telu of the commonwealth. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby tile out put if the bullion producing countries? and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver, could be adjmted iu conformity with the population, weaitn and communal needs of each. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock the surplus of reduction of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the genera) remonetization of silver. To the accomplishment of these ends so far as they can be attained by separate treaties tlie negotiations already concluded and sow iu progress have been directed, and the favor with which this enlarged policy has thus far been re ceived warrants the belief that its operations will ere long embrace all. or nearly all, the countries | of this Hemisphere. It is “by Sb iSgaus desira. however, that the policy under considers?*' should be applied to these countries alone a “ , ' s The healthful enlargement of trade with* ' ro|>e, Asia and Africa should liu sought bi ing tariff burdens on such of their war!* 1 neither we nor the other American sta’eT 58 fitted to produce, and thus enabling obtain hi return a better market or our mido 10 of food, of raw material and of the manufaSS in which v.e excel.

The pestilence, which for the past two years him been raging in the countries of the east, recently male its appearance In European ports, with which we arc in constant communication. The then, secretary of the treasury in pursuance o( a proclamation of the president, issued certain ny illations restricting and fora time prohibiting the importation of rags and the admission of baggage of immigrants and of travelers arriving from in fected quarters. Lest this course may nave been wilhoit strict warrantor law, I approve recom mendation of the prevent secretary that congn ss lake action in tile premises, and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures, as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epidemic and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily ex tend to our shores. 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The amnia! report at the commissioners of the IHstrictof Columbia reviews the operations of the several departments of its municipal gov ernment, and I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions is respect to legislation especially commending such as relate to a revision of the civil and criminal code, the performaco of labor by pci-sons sentenced to imprisonment In the jail, the construction and occupation of wharves along the river front and the erection of a suitable building for district offices. A PENSION FOR GRANT, i recommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S.
