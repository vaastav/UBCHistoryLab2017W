'ALBUQUERQUE NEW MEXICO THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 190. m , , . The Santa Fe Central . HE comprehensive statement given by Mr. Torrance, In yesterday's ornlng Journal concerning the condition ami prospects of tho Santa Central Railway company. Is highly encouraging to the people of Albuquerque. If Mr. Torrance states the cane correctly he has a mll- lion and a half of his own money invested In the enterprise, and It Is therefore fair to assume that he knows whereof he speaks. He evidently understands , existing conditions in this part of the southwest, and does not overestimate the Importance to his company of the early completion of that portion of the lino down Tijeras canyon w hich will give the road direct connection with Albu querque. He sees that the road needs this connection, as a business propo- sltlon, and On the part of the people of Albuquerque we are fully warranted In aaying that we are equally desirous of getting the road. We need It in our bus iness. Our people fully appreciate the importance to them of that line, ami personal interest, If no better motive, would cause them to wish it, the highest measure of success mid a proper regard for the truth compels us to admit that the publlcln general will not take the trouble to go behind the returns to bee where the money comes from. It Is true, and not nt all strange, thnt developments In the matter of the ritUburg bank wreck, as given to the public from time to time by the Associ ated Press as well as the loen) papers of Pittsburg, have served to shake the fulth of many of our people In the completion of the line under Its present management, and excite a reasonable fear that the work might be hung up in definitely, hence If the apparently straightforward statement of the case given to the public by Mr. Torrance shall prove to tie correct, as wc hope It may, It will Inspire new confidence In the enterprise, and cause the people of Albu querque to regard it In a much more hopeful light. Mr. Hopewell, the general manager of the line, assures us, without golriK Into-detalls. that the necessary arrangements have been made for the com pletion of the road to Albuquerque, and since Mr. JfopewHI enjoys the con fidence an'l respect of all our people this announcement from him will tío much to restore public confidence in the successful outcome of the enterprise. The Scenic 'Road " Easy Steps for little I Vet. , Oh, See that Funny Thing. What Is that Queer Pro-po-sitloh? That, my child, Is tho Twilight tMiueak. Oh, what a Fun-ny name. "Why do they call It the Twl-IIght (Squeak? My child. 1 am surprised at your Stupidity. 'It is called toe Twilight Squeak because it Squeaks at Twi-Ilght. What makes the Twl-IIght Squeak act so Queer-ly ? It is having an Kpi-lep-tlc Fit. What is an Knl-len-tic Fit, mother? An Kpl-leptlc Fit is a Combination of a Par-o-xysm ainl a Convul-si-on. What makes the Squeak have Epi-lep-tic Fits? -V- Be-cause It Is Ver-y Mad. Hut what makes the Squeak so mad? Some-one said Andrews, my child. Now run and play. Albuquerque's "Good Friend,' the Almanac. When It comes to the saloon, gamb ling and social evil questions in the Duke city, it must be admitted ihat the politicians of that town amr the Albuquernue Yellow Journal are quite willing to leave bad enough alone. The Almanac. In a trial down in Tucson the other day, a "colored gemman" undertook to show the board of supervisors, as evidence, how the game of craps is played. They had to adjourn the trial. The funny old fossil at Santa Fe is now falling all over himself to soft soap the new governor. But It Is said the new governor is dead wise. Now John Sharp Williams has In troduced a bill in aid of prohibition. The next thing Henry Wattcrson will mount the temperance platform. - It is rather suspMous on the face of It that the Citizen has no Idea of a special dispatch except a "fake con cocted in the office." The San Juan County Index says Mr. Hagerman has no coterie of "political parasites" attached to him. What a refreshing change. i Senators Burton and Mitchell have received a quiet tip from the august body to which they belong to "just keep away." It Is really funny to see the Even ing Citizen throwing mud at its own news service. ) It Is too bad the way those poor de fenseless Insurance companies are rob bed. The democrats nre rapidly earning the sobriquet of the 'Me Too Party." Mr. McXarv's views on statehood were just a little Inopportune. The Czar, Is still "Inflexibly determined." nil M PA no LI U lu bi Mia o; i

UK territorial hlghwuy commonly known aH "the .Scenic Uoad " Is now complete from Sania Fe to Las Vegas, and the section next In order Is that from Santa Ke to Alhuquerque, the object being the ultimate con struction of a first class wagon highway from the northern to the southern limit of the territory. The people of Albuquerque me more especi ally Interested In the section from this c Ity to Santa Fe than In any other part of the road, though of almost equal Importance to us Is fhe portion of the road leading to the south, and which, as wo understand It, 1m to follow the Rio Grande valley. This part, we believe, Is to come next, after the section to .San ta Fe shall he completed. 1 The building of this road Is a matter of more than a little importance to our people, and Its location, especially through the mountains, is a work that ought to receive attention at our hands. This is an affair that the Commercial ( luh might very properly t ike In hand, and we have no doubt that the territor ial officials having the business In charge would cheerfully make any reason able deviations In the line that the people through their representatives might request.

THK editor of the Citizen thanks the editor of the Opile for the Informa tion that he, the Optic man, has been In New Mexico for fifty years. In our case, the sensation created by that Information was one of surprise rather than of thankfulness, since the virile and robust manner in which the Optic editor threshes around had led us to think that ho had been here at least a hundred years.

Still, he has put his hand ' to tho plow, no to speak, In opening the White House to the original football ! conference early In the season. One regrets to observe that we have had an ' old-fashioned season of the game, culminating In a mighty roar of protest against its Inhumanities, notwithstanding that In earlyVx tober the. president of the United States appealed to his young football friends throughout the ,' land for a clean. Irreproachable, above- rltlclsm kind of sport, such as any j fond father would love to see his son engage In. The season. In short, has not been altogether a happy one, in view of the prrsident's Intervention in th game which he lovos so well and which he earnestly desires to have preserved for the sake of Its manly qualities. What his success will he hereafter no on. would dare to say, yet this much Is certain if Mr. Roosevelt can put football "beyond criticism, without abandoning It, to its enemies, he will score one of tlrt tnost Illustrious triumphs of an Illustrious administration.

CONGRESSMAN XTEI'II KXH. of Texas, wants to find out something about Ihe forest reserve scrip that Is being located extensively on the choice lands of tho Tecos valley. The congressman seems to think somebody has struck a soft thlnt In the lieu land business and there are others who Incline to the same pplnlon. Let Mr. Ktephens pfohe the matter to the bottom. THE perspicacious editor of the Las Vegas Optic has discovered by a t are, ful reading of the president's message, that Mr. Roosevelt "Inclines" toward Joint atatehlod. Well, It really does look that way. The most reliable his torian of the deluge informs us that when the water had risen above the hill tops an old fellow, standing on the highest peak, with his chin just above wa ter, solemnly announced that "It looks like ralnt" The Las Vegas pronounce fnent shows how history can repeat Itself when the right man gets hold .of It
