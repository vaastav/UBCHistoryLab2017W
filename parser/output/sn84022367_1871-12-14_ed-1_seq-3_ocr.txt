THE RUTLAND HifiHALJU TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12. 1871. The Lecture Course Concert. The "Barnabee Troupe" were re ceived by a large and appreciative audi enoe; and our only regret whs tbt these really accomplished artists should hive been welcomed with m little of tbe enthu siasm whioh their ability io their respec tive roles would have warranted. They ere no strangers to our community, atid with their reputaiion as musicitns of a high order of talent, they were entitled to a strong demonstration at the commence ment of the evening's entertainment. Ac an apology for thi long delynd expres lon ef the feeling which abonld have been lospired by the opening Trio, "Life has no power," we have nothing to offer, be oue the alarm of fire had not then been given, which so speedily aroused the au dience at the commencement of the song by Mr Ft-ssenden. The little episode may after all be con sidered as a starting point in tbe pie ax ureable excitement which prevailed after tbe audience became quieted under the delightful warble of the cantatrioa of the ever.ing, who win entitled to the highest meed uf praise fur her execution in Ver din moat artistlo Cnvatiua "Ernani Iovj laml," under the impressing influences ot the fear which would ordinarily attach to so recent an alarm of fire ! The house began to warm more decidedly when Mr. Smith Hn.i Mr. Barnabee Hung Loug feMow'n 'Eso-lior," which would have satinfl-d the Hurlimice by a (timple repeti tion although they were grateful for the Trio "I Navigacti," which was given io ?DHwer to the encore; tHos calling out the mellow tenor of Mr. Feaxenden in ac cord with the pefect basso of Mr. Birna bee, and the well halnned eoprane ot Mrs. Smith.

There were tbos among his hearera who have listened to tb.it aide splitting Bong fur the past forty ye..ra, aiid who are willing to award to B unahee the palm of all other perform ers. In the second part of the evening's entf rtxinment, we were charmed with tbe Scotch Duet, "When ye gang awa," as ring hy Mrs. Smith and Mr. Fessenrteo ; which was followed by an tffnclive ballad by OlariKel, entitled, ' You and I." in which Mr. Fes-endfn acquitted himself wit bis w-ual grnce, and afterward gra' ified Ms Hiiiftn'e with an Italian Song, ' Q iert O Qanllu," by Vrdi.

INDIANA. The Attorney-General o Indl.La is now engaged io investigate tbe acconnta of tbe State officers, includ ing a large number of retired cfSotals. These inveht'gations have been attended wi'h tbe most satisfactory results. Oa of these retired ifficers, a former Stitt printer, has come forward and proposed te return to tbeTreavory nineteen thousand dollars in satisfaction for bis liabilitier for money overdrawn. This proposition bits been accepted, and it is believed that other plunderers will be compelled to re store tbe spoils of f ffbo whioh they hav held for many years.

Editor Rutland Herald I have no tioed recently io yrur paper several arti olea im which is discussed the propriety of u-ing tbe words "is being and upon reading them I am induced to place my thoughts, upon that matter, in suitable form for publication, if it please you to insert them in THE HERALD, and there by continue the discussion. Since I knew anything of grammar, I have in nearly all oases favored tbe custom of Murray, who always used "is being," with the acoom panying participle requisite to complete the sense of the sentence. Whenever have deviated from this custom, and have done so in very few instances, it has been in accordance with usage bo long es tablished that no one presumes to dispute its correctness. I refer now to such sen tences as tbe following : "The ship is loading," etc. ; "Apples sell," etc. Where the above are used the words "is being," may be substituted, and with tb appropriate change of form in the verb will be equally carrect. Bat incorreot nesa in formation is not in question in the sentencee mentioned. In the first one the ship is personified, receives animation and is thereby enabled te perform an ac tion. By the rules of rhetoric any inan imate thing may be personified in writing and made the aubjct of an aotion. Clear ly, then, sentences prepared in such form are correct by the use of a rhetori 01 figure, but grammatical rules, which are subordinate to those of rhetoric will oonderan them. Mr. Richard Grant White, in his book "Words and their uses," attempts to ridi cule people into quitting the use of " 18 being." but though his arguments to ao complish that end are very plausible, they approach absurdity, in my opinion He gfvea citations from various authors to support his arguments, but of course qf.tes from no writer who opposes his ideas ; and his opponents are as numer nus and reputable as his supporters. In the' United States his doctrine has been generally accepted without dispute, but Eagliah writers are not so willing to do ao and have uttered some vigorous thoughts in favor of the older usage One gentleman in particular, (I think Mr, Foster, F. R- S.,) has become conspicuous by preparing an exhaustive criticism on Mr. White'a book, and directing his re marks especially to that chapter which treats of "is being. I, myself, have not seen Mr. r. s article entire, but am in formed that it effectually demolishes the fallacies advanced by Mr. White. As for discarding the offending words, heoauae some authors of good repute do so, we may with rqual propriety follow them ia other commoa errors, which are perceived only by tbe experienced eye. For the sake of euphony and to avoid ambiguity, the rhetorical rule mentioned aV)vn ia fr-qiently applied, and no wri er however much he may uphold Mr. White, will apply this rule in every oase wSere "ia being" ia nsed. Whioh of the following sentences sounds best, and whioh is the clearest? "Tbe by is being whipped," or, "The boy ia whipping." I take it for granted that all will con cede that the first is the best. So far aa grammar ia concerned, "ia being" cannot be thrown aside except by the aid of the superior rnlea of rhetoric Both methods of expression may be right, and both may ho wrong ; sound and sense will deter mine. Clark, in hia grammar, says : "Action is sometimes improperly predi cted of a passive euruct. liSamplps Yu are mistaken, for You mistake. The houe is bniMing, for The house ia being hnilf; which Biana, The honae ia bo-com-ng built, ie, people are at work upon it ; but the bouse does not act. This is a good assertion and is applica- b'e in most oases, if not In all ; but few parsons would construe "is being" as Ca'k does, though he is obviously in the right. J. B. H A Syracuse Barbkb Balances Ac cnrjNTq with Mark Twain. Mark Twain lectured in Syracuse on Wednes day evening last. In that city there dwells a barber who, ever since tha ap pearance of Mark Twin's essay on bar bers, has vowed to make he humorist's imagination a real experience to him. flis opportunity CBme on Wednesday af. 'ernoon, and the Syracuse Courier tVqa describes the incident : A gentleman present whispered to Jake bat, the man in his chair was Mark Twain, and on that hint Jake 'went for him.' Seleoting the dullest razor in the shep, he sharpened it up a little, and then -e'zing Twain by the nose with a grip that weuld bring down a bullock, he com menced to lather him. He soaped him 'ronj chin to eyebrows, and rushed the ather-brush about an inoh up his nose, nd thence into both ears, poor Twain in -ha meantime snorting and sputtering like a steam engine blowing off steam. Io vain he protested that he did not want Sis eyebrows and forehead shaved. Keep still, save Jake, I know my business. Af "r soping him until he looked like an al bino, Jake laid on the blade. The first stroke brought tears t Twain's eyes. The second brought him 'o n sitting poaition with the exclamation, I say that r-zor'a too dull to shave me with.' 'Lay down,' says Jake, thrusting him down into tbe chair again ; that ra jnr will cut a hair I know my business ' Twain groaned, and Jake pulled until the beard was off and a good portion of the skiB with it. After shaving Jake pro ceeded to wash him ap, selecting the dirt iest towel in the shop, one that was uted ror wiping off hair dye, and was as spot ed as Joseph's eoat. Jake eoused the water in hia eyes and nostrils, and then wiped him off. The spectators by this rime were unable to control their laughter, and burst ont into loud peals in whioh Take heartily Joined. Twain saw the j ike but kept quiet. When Jake told him his hair was coming out, and offered to sll him a bottle of heir restorative, price three dollars per bottle. Twain replied, 'Well I rather want my hair to fall out, 1 have too much foi eomfort.' Jake then offered to sell him a hottle of 'bloom of youth,' telling him that he was badly freckled. 'Am 1, said Mark, 'well I rather like that. If I was good looking and fair to gaza upon th ladies would alt fall in love with me, and that would make my wife uneasy. Aa it is she allows me to rom about the conn- ry without fear. She knows my ugli ness will protect me." Jake saw he oould not perecnta Mark any farther, and after brushing him off in a lusty and vigorou manner, said, 'Mr. Twain how did vnu like your shave.' 'Ohl said Mark, 'this is nothing new. Every bar ber in the country goes far me in the ..ame style. I am nsed to it, and in fact t rather like it.' 'Gall again,' said Jake. -Not if I oan help it replied Mark, 'good day.' Paris.

At fifteen mtnutes past twelve on the 7tb, aa the workmeB had gone to din ner a fire broke out iu the dry house be longing to Messrs. Sweeny and Barrows tn our village. The building is Bituated jast below tbe paper mill, south of Sweeny & Burrows doer and blind manufactory, and north of Ticknor & Goodrich's grist mill, and of course endangered the build inga I have named. Oar fire company was promptly oa the spot, and with an hours labor, succeeded in putting cut the fire. Loss of Messrs. Sweeny & Burrows' not over $ 100, Willie Dewey, son of Josiah Dewey, aged 10 years, had the misfortune last week to break his Brm while wrestling with a playmate. The arm was set, and the little fellow is doing as well as could be expected. The winter term of our graded school commences to-day with the same teachers as last term, with Prof. A. J. Sanborn as principal, We hope it may be fully suc cessful, for no pains will be spared by Prof. S., and those teaching with him to make it so. It has cost much labor to put the system of graded school teaching into successful operation with us, and we now mean to keep it along on a success ful basis, increasing in numbers and in terest. A unitsd people will never suffer the present status of our educational in terests to lapse back into the old system of thirty or forty years ago. The present advantages we possess, and the great im provement in our children only thow us what has been lost in past years. But let the dead buay the dead, the living is what we are after, that which furnishes mnecle and brains for the world of thought and enterprise and improvement. But I forbear, for I never get upon thia topic of common school, or rather graded school education but what I grow enthu siastic. But one thing is true, the sub ject will never grow stale as long as child ren are born and have to be educated. The next lecture in course before the Lecture Association of Middlebury, will be delivered on the evening of the 18rh inst., at tbe Hall of the Graded School House, by Paul DeChallu, the African explorer. We anticipate a full house aa tha lecturer is of world wide celebrity not only as an explorer, but of genius combined with talents of a high order. The great event of the past week with ns, was that of the lecture of Fred erick Douglass, on Sun Domingo, so fine ly and fully reported by your able re porter in the Daily of last Thursday. I well remember the time when Mr. Doug. lass was in our village, some thirty years ago, in company with Mr. Bradburn and others; lecturing upon the wickedness of Amerioan slavery. I well remembfr. alao, the abusive treatment he received at the hands of some, who to day, tin- queationably.regret the course they pursu ed towards him and hia associates upjn that occasion. Amid hooting and revel ings ha stood up the representative of hi- abused and down-trodden race, an4 in language the most scathing he denounced the system of American slivery, portray ing it eflvcts, not only upon the bodies and souls of its unfortunats victims, but its horrible desolating influence upon the morals, politics and religion of the na tion, corrupting the sources of power, re ligions and political, controlling the ohurches, Congress and State Legisla tures of the country, overiding the judi ciary and making the national executive a servile tool to do ita unholy bidding. Thirty years have passed away and this sme then abused, honest vindicator of the righ'a of man, stands among us in the accomplished leotnre, and greeted with rounds of spplanse from the solid sub stantial citizens of Middlebury and sur rounding towns, who assembles in large numbers to listen to his matohleas eloqu ence in support of a measure in which he takes a deep and absorbing interest. While he was speaking my mind ran back to the time when he was hnnted after by rapacious and blood-thirsty slaveholders, desirous to seiz upon him and crush out from his soul the God in spiring iDflaenoes of freedom that urged him on iu his effort to free his country men from the galling yoke that bound them down to servitude the most galling, and despotism the most damning. He has lived to witness the emanciption of the race from slavery, but iu a way that he little thought (in common with the est of ns) would be by Divine Provid ence be adopted. He is now in no danger from o, fugitive slave law, enacted by slaveholders and interpreted by R. B. Taney, but oau go up and down the land protected bs a citizen by the flg of our county, enjiying all te rights under the constitution he may ask, and the peer politically, ai. least, of the prondeat in the land, and intellectually of some of the brightest minds that adorn our history's page. Mr. Douglass told your correspon dent, that he used to, while a slave, read with thrilling interest the anti-slavery speeches of Hon. Wm. Slade, delivered in Congress, as they were published in the National Intelligencer, at Washington, and that they did much to quicken and strengthen his resolution te war with the monster as long as he lived. I was glad to witness the hearty greeting that he re ceived in our village last week. It was a ju'it, praiseworthy and honest tribute to personal worth, exoellent abilities and trustworthy ptriotisni. Upon the sub ject of his lecture I oan only say, I am in hearty accord with his views, and have beon, ever sinoe I read the report of tbe oommi'sion headed by honest Ben Wade I know that Senator Sumner is most bit ter in his opposition to the measure. But Senator Sumner oan have his views and the rest of us can have ours, upon reading the able and impartial report made. Oar own Senator Morrill is also opposed to the acquisition of the Island or Territory of San Domingo, and he made an able speech upon the subject which I read with great interest. But I failed to see any reason why I should ohange my opinion. I well remember that Senator Sumner strongly advocated the purchase from Russia of the territory of Alaska, at an expense of about eight million of dollars. And what did we get ? Why, some hundreds of Indians, thousand of square miles of icebergs and plenty of seals, etc, and that territory has cost ns millions of dollars to govern, and is to be an incumbrance upon us for all time, without any returning compen sation to relieve the situation. Santo Domingo is better worth fifty millions to the nation than to have Alaska given te us for nothing. But I have con fidence in President Grant to believe that be knows about this eubjeot as well as Senator Sumner, and I believe further, that he fa as honest and upright in his motives aa Mr. Sumner, and possessed of 

WEEKLY HERALD, THURSDAY, DECEMBER H, 1871. as good sound judgment as any of bis traduoers, be they Senators or others. Mr Douglass at times in his lecture was sur passingly eloquent, and through the en tire hour and a-half was deeply interest ing. May heaven bless him with long life, that he may labor for the good of his race, and for the glory and honor of pur common country, Kev. Mr. Converse of Burlington agent for the Vermont Colonization So ciety, was in town last Sabbath soliciting aid in behalf of said society. He address ed the Methodist congregation in the fore noon and took up a collection. He is an earnest man and is doing a vast amount of good for the cause of religion and civi lizition iu spending his time and talent to aid in raising Africa from heathenism and from superstition to the enjoyment of the light and liberty of Bible Christianity The Republio of Liberia is under a great obligation for its prosperity to such men as Mr. Converse, who have stood by it in storm as well ns sunshine. CANDOR. Deo. lltb, 1871. Cavendish, Tradition informs us that this place received its name from the following cir cumstance: An Indian rambling over tbe northern limits of the town, ia years agone, perceived in the yard of Cipt. Coffin a calf, which had accidentally fallen into 8 large trough, and which he appropriately called Calf-in dish. Ever after in making allusion to this region, he would say, "the place where I saw a calf-in-dish." Hence, by a slight etymological change, spruBg the word Cavendish. (?) We had been accustomed to attribute this name to a different origin, and cannot now conscien tiously vouch for the veracity of the tra dition. Hawks Mountain derived its name from Capt. Hawks, who in his march north with a few men under his command, en camped upon the western side. Some in dications of the old camping ground were visible in 1S50. -Proctorsville and Duttonsville were named respectively after two of tho first settlers, Trcctor and Dutton. -The Black River Academy, which flourished for a long time, has been for many years ex'inct. The Normal and graded schools are exterminating the old academies, not only in our own, but in neighboring Statea. Wilbin the past few years, nearly one-tnira ot tee asademies in Vermont have passed out of existence. Ex-Gov. Fletcher has been confined to hia house for the past two weeks, and was unable to attend his brother's funeral at Townshend. The Governor has been an active, energctio man in our commun ity, and we hope that many years of use fulness and happiuess yet remain for him. D. C. Pollard of Proctorsville, we understand, wishes to retire from his mer cantile bu-iuess on account of ill health. Here is a good opening for some enter prising buMues man. The village library and Fletcher do nation are well cared for by the ffii'ieDt postmaster, K-ndall Taylor. Judging from external appearances, tbe books are well conned. The reading community, we apprehend, is larger in ProctorsMe than Cavendish. In tbe former place the library is situated in a pliceof publio re sort in the latter, in a private dwelling. No public library ought to be placed in a private house. Exertions are being made to form a dramatic society, which we hope will snc ced. We need something of this kind to relieve the monotony of the long winter evenings. Hon. Rufus F. Andrews of New York city, was once a resident of this plaoe, and we can almost remember when he was as needy ss tho'rest cf ns now are. H. B. Atherton, Eq , of Nashua, N. H., a native of this tiwn, is engaged in "writing up" a history of the place, which will soon appear ia Miss Hemenway's Magazine. Frank Ely has made some improve ments upon his house, and materially en haneed the appearance of the street, by erecting a new fence. Daane & Wilson have departed for Woodstock to attend the County Court. Below the new spring mill a short distance, is situated one of the best water privileges iu the State. A good chance for some man who wishes to engage in manufacturing. The site is owned by Mr. Abel Hill. Our schools arc all in lively oper ation. Business is good, but money a little "tight." TnE Herald makes us a welcome visit each morning. Almost Fatal Mishai Mrs. Jessie H. Rupert, the soldiers' friend, who lec tured iu Rutland, a few months since, under the auspices of the Grand Army of the Republic, met with with a very seri ous but fortunately not fatal mishap while stopping at the house of Rev. Mr. Newman, in Lanesbero, Mass., one night last week. The bedroom as signed to her was over the family sitting room which was heated by a coal stove, and a register in tbe ceiliag carried the warm air into the room above. During the night the wind dislodged a brick from the top of the chimney, which fell down and rested against the stove pipe in such a way es to stop it up, and thus foroe the coal gas out of the open stove doer. It rcs9 through the register and filled Mrs. Rupert's room and nearly caused her death. When called in tbe morning she was found to be insensible and did not recover from the bad effects for several days. She was able to leave on Thur8day!lfor her home in New Mar ket, Va. Another Railroad Enterprise. The Whitehall limes learns from author ity that there is a movement on foot for the early construction of a narrow gauge surface railroad from Rutland to White hall. The movement is inaugurated by the marble dealers of West Rutland and the slate dealers ef Hydeville and Fair haven, and it is backed up by the trans portation companies of Whitehall. Tbe principal cause of this movement is the high rates of freight charged over the Rutland & Washington and Rensselaer & Saratoga Railroads. Must TESTIPT.-During a recent liquor trial in Merrimao county, N. H., tbe pur chaser refused to testify, alleging that be would thereby criminate himself. The ease was carried to the full bench on this question, where it was decided that it was tbe intention of the Legislature to protect tbe purchaser from punishment for pro curing the sale, and that he is not exempt from testifying. Fire. At about 3 o'clock, last evening, a fire was discovered proceeding from a small wooden building owned by Joseph E. Gibson and used as a carriage shop, situat ed in the rear of, and about twenty feet from the blacksmith shop, No. 134, Main street, also owned by Gibson. Tbe slarm was quickly sounded from the bell of Engine House No. 1, and soon after from the whistle of tbe railroad shops, and was promptly responded to by the several en gine companies and the Hook and Ladder company. When first discovered the fire was in the northeast corner of the shop, some feet distant from the stove, and quickly enveloped the whole building ia flames, and spread to tbe ell part of the adjoining building. No. 1SQ Main street. This was a brick bnilding, two stories high, with a wooden story and a half ell in the rear and situated some twelve or fourteen feet south of the carriage shop, and occu pied by Mr. Gibson as a residence. When the engines took water, the north side and roof, of this ell, were in a fierce blaze and the entire building seemed doomed, but the volume of water thrown by the hand engines soon got it under control and in a very few minutes quench d it. The blacksmith shop was unin jurcd. There was an insurance on the shop of $150, and on its oontents, consisting of lumber, hubs, spokes, etc., $300, both in the Lycoming Insnranoe Company, re presented by M. J. Francisco. Mr. Gib son estimates the loss on the bnilding at $500 and on its contents at $800. The furniture was removed from Mr. Gibson's residence, and was, of course somew hat injured. The damage to the house we did not ascertain. It was in sured for $1000, in the Vermont Mutual, represented H. W. Porter, but the insur ance will probably prove unavailing as some repairs and additions were being made to it, without a permit having been granted for that purpose. The origin of the fire is unknown. Mr. Gibson states that be left the shop at six o'clock, and that it was then safe, and that, to his knowledge, no one had enter ed it nfterwards, and that the first he knew of the fire was npon its discev ry about 8 p. m., by a carpenter at work with him in the back part of the adjaoent building, and that tbe fire was then, as we have stated, in tbe northeast corner of the shop and some feet distant from the stove. All of the fire companies, as we have aaid, were promptly on hand, but as the fire was so quickly got under control, the steamer, by order of the Chief Engineer, was not called into service. Castlkton. Mr. F. S. Heath, who has been familiar with the history of Lak B imoseen for twenty years or more, gives the following dates o' its freez'ng over for several years past : Do. 8rb, 1859; Dc. 15th, 18C0; Deo. 24. 1861; Deo. 7. 18G2; Dc in, 1863; Deo. 5. 1864; Deo. 14, 1865; Dr. 18. 18C6; Dec. 9, 1867; Dc, 12.1868; Deo. 23. 18G9; Dec. 20, 1S70; Dao 2. 1871. In 1863 it froze over tbe lOrh of Deoember, but was clear of ice again from the 14h to the 20th. This lake ia one of, if not the largest, body of water in the State, being nine miles long, and some short of two miles wide in the widest place. It averages one-half mile in width for six miles, and is capable of run ning quite a steam vessel. We well re member of taking a voyage through this lake oa a steam boat of five or ten horse power, in company with some thirty or forty other passengers, on a pleasant sum mer afternoon about the year 1850. This boat plyed on the lake through tbe season, Capt. George Kilbouro, commander. A. W. Hyde, Eq., was the proprietor and projector of the enterprise. The funeral of our lamented -fellow townsman, Charles Largdon, wss attend ed from his lata residence, last Friday af ternoon, A large number were pre snt, considering the intense oold and high wind that prevailed at the time. Rev. Lewis Francis was the officiating clergy man, assisted by Rev. S. G. Mattbawson. The arrangements were under the direc tion of Hon. Pitt W. Hyde, with the fol lowing, who were intimate friends of tbe deceased, aoting as pall-bearers: E. H. Armstrong, Henry Armstrong, H. H. Brown, I. M. Guy, M. B. Dewey, n. G. Barton. Of this once large and unbroken family circle, consisting of the parents, five daughters and two sons, only one of the number was in attendance, namely, Mrs. Elizibeth C. Wilson of St. Louis. T&ie readings and musio at tbe chapel last Tuesday evening, were duly appreci ated by a numereus and attentive audi ence. C. E. Jackman and W. A. Redlng ton, old schoolmates at Castleton, Andov er, and East Hampton, Mass., spent last week iu Montreal. Redington will be recognized as a Western correspondent of The HERALD.over the signature "W.A.R." Vermont's favorite poet, who held a dialogue with Justine Donahue, in Troy, as described in The Herald, last Thurs day, is well known in Castleton. Twen ty years ago or more he was in the employ of tbe lata Smith Sherman, as a superior artist at cutting or carving marble. Since that time he has become demoralized somewhat, from the effects of alcoholio drinks. Previous to coming to America he was an assistant clerk in one of tbe banks in Dublin, Ireland. He is a joker as well as a poet, and is brim fall of tbe real Irish wit. Andy Karney came to this country from Ireland ten years ago, remaining here eight years. He went baek to the old country with the intention of never re turning to America. After spending about a year and a half there, he began to desire to see his adopted country, "the land of the free and the home of the brave." We can imagine that he said to himself, I "On Ireland's stormy banks I 6tand, And cast a wishful eye To old Vermont, that happy land, Where I must live and die." He arrived at Castleton after an absence of two years Nov. 1, 1871. We enjoyed a hearty laugh over the perusal of the graphic account of tbe 24 hours' walk at tbe Sanderson House, in Rutland, last week. But the best of it was the description of tbe sumptuous sup per that followed the successful walking feat, without the aid of intoxicating drink te wash it down. No doubt the boarders at the Sanderson House can recommend it as a first class house, and worthy of tbe patronage of those who are furnished with a living at the expense of the State. A large audience passed an hour last Friday night at the Advent church, most agreeably and profitably, hearing Mr. Abbott, a young student in Middlebury Oellege, on the "nature of alcohol, and its effects on the human system." This phaie of tha subjeot of temperance had not been presented to a" Castleton audi ence in many years. The prinoiple that the violation of all laws, human and di vine, are visited with some penalty, soon er or later, on tbe offender, was ably pre sented by the young speaker. At the con elusion of the address he was greeted with a round of applause and a liberal contri bution in cash, for which he tendered a grateful acknowledgment. u. w. B. Winbsor County. The grand jury were discharged on Saturday last, after reporting twenty-six true bills, and two bills not found. Each attorney at the bar seemed to claim that he was one of the two. Judge Barrett, on aooount of his health, adjourned the court from Saturday a. m, te Monday two o'clock a. m. Tbe two jury cases tried last week, re sulted in favor of plaintiffs. In the first A. T. Barron won, and in the second Geo. Tenney, a lawyer who hoists bis shingle at White River Junction, and sued Mr. Wright for assault and battery, gat a ver dict of one cent. Wright was collector of taxes, and held a town tax of $1.70 against the lawyer, who would not pay it, but was going to plead in offset his dis allowed acooont against the town So Wright carried Tenney to jail, and be cause be would not walk, having, aa ap peared in evidenee an attack of tbe sciotal hernia, he persuaded him into a sleigh and carried bim te Woodstock, and fear ing an escape Wright persuaded Tenney to let him bind his bands and arms. Doubtless the jury found tbe fact that tbe ropes, not the lawyer were a cent's worth too tight. At a bearing of a case at Ingraham'a Hotel in Chester, a Windsor oounty law yer a few days sinoe beoame so absorbed in the case in whioh he was engaged, that at tbe tea table be was real jolly and while freely entertaining his friends by anecdotes and the utterance of witty say ings, took from his pocket his tobacco box, removed the lid and placed the box be side his plate, then takiag op his tea enp in his attempt to quaff the beverage there in, turned the liquid among his "fine cut' instead of into his saucer, This reminds us of an anecdote told of Gov. B. Gratz Brown, of Missouri, whe last season at a dinner party while partak ing of the dessert, for some cause or other became so absent minded as to butter his watermelon. These cases of absent mind edneea find a parallel in tbe well known attempt by a late distingushed Vermont statesman, who at Montpelier a few years ago amused bis legislative friends at din ner table by explaining how good his eye sight was, though advanoing years other wise admonished him that time told. A plate of doughnuts ohanoed to be near him on tbe table, and the man of keen vision soon extended his arm, fork in hand, to take a samole cf his favorite tuberose food, when O I instead of s pota to, he began to peel a nice brown, crusty doughnut. Great was the laugh, and none iu after years enjoyed the joke bet ter than the hapless perpetrator of it himself. C. Hartford Life and Annuity In surance Company. By referenoe to our advertising columns it will be seen that a new life insurance company has just been introduced into Rutland, and that Mr. V. C. Meyerhoffer, well known to our cit izens, has the management of the same for this State. His office is looated at No. 1 Bank Block, where he will be pleased to see his friends and all who desire a life insuranoe policy. This company is established npon the new feature of tbe interest bearing plan that is rapidly becoming popular with the people, whioh secures to the assured tbe benefits of life and endowment insur anoe, combined with the advantages of a savings bank. This is a new system of life insuranoe worthy of investigation. By this plan six per cent per annum is allowed, at oompound interest on all pre miums issued, until tbe aggregate amount of premiums paid and interast thereon shall be equal to the sum insured ; then no further payment, whatever, will be re quired on tbe policy, and the allowsnoe of dividends will commence. The divid ends are payable in cash and declared an nually upon tbe sum insured. All polic ies are made absolutely non-forfeitable, after the allowance of dividends thereon has commenced, premiums and interests are non-forfeitible from the beginning. The company is well officered, aad is recommendrd by Governor Jewell and ex-Qovernor Gen. Joseph R. Hawley of Connecticut. The opinion entertained of the interest bearing plan by men of experience and education in life insurance, is manifest from the high commendation given it io the Insurance Monitor and Wall Street Review in September last, which says : "The arch of Life Insurance ia now oivplete. Its key atone is firmly placed, and tbe structur will now sustain the weight of many millions of liv-sandof agea to come. The Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company has flnfabed the good work, by taking- from the only rival in. stum ion to life insurance companies ita most dis tinctive and a 'tractive feature, and adding- it to the other advantages and e xoel'enctes of h latter tbe interest bearing ptan. Tbe company propose to grant toans on tha interest bearing p liriea, not to exceed one half of the snm in sured. Other features of the plan offer unnsasl induoemtnts ti persons desirioas of Insuring-on the m 'S- profitable erm. and ita advocates ap pear to be tally pe'su&ded of its superiority over a'l the prominent system in vogue, whether mu tual or et -ck. New London Railroad. Governor Smith of the Vermont Central, G. Merrill, general superintendent, J. W. Hobart, general freight agent, the general ticket agent, the superintendent of bridges, mas ter mechanio and master car builder, with several of the directors, forming a party of twelve, made a careful Inspection, last week, of the New London Northern rail road, jast leased by them ; and all the di rectors will pass over tbe road and form ally acoept the lease. The New London Northern company is to be paid one hun dred and fifty thousand dollars a year, (which is ten per cent on the present cost of tbe road) besides fifteen per cent on every one hundred thousand dollars gross increase of receipts. This will permit the stockholders to secure a seven per cent an nual dividend, after having increased the capital stock 42 85 per oent, with a fur ther prospective income under tbe 15 per oent arrangement.

Mr. Satnner said be was not anxious to enlarge the juris diction of the Seoate at the expense of the House, but claimed that tbe Senate bad always bad power to originate meas ures of this character. Tbi was not a bill to raise revenue, hut a bill to reduce taxes, and surely the Senate oould origi nate suoh a bill. Mr. Sherman said the bill raised the taxes on spirits from fifty to eighty oents. Mr. Sumner repli-d tbal the inorease was only apparent, not real. It was mere ly bringing together the existing taxes on -pirite.

The several subjects embraced in this courfO are, "Idolatry of Publio Opinion," "Little Idols, and the mischief they make," the 'Demon of Intemperance."
