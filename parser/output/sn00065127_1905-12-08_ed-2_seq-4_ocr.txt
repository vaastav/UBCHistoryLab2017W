'At 5 20 Wednesday afternoon Con rad Lawrence Brandbagen, passed away after suffering less than a year from consumption. A year ago he was a powerful young man and weigh ed about 180 pounds, fiarly last spring he showed symptoms of the dread disease and during the early summer weeks his case became alarming. Finally he and his father went to Texas, his father hoping for some benefit to his son from a change of climate but the dry bracing atmos phere of northwestern Texas gave no relief and Conrad camc home accom panied by his Uncle. Human aid was powerless and the young man gradual ly grew weaker and the end came Wednesday evening. He was 21 years of age Sept. 1. A simple service will be held at the family home in the city next Saturday morning at 10 30 by Rev. Solem after which the body will be conveyed to West Prairie church in Grant Township where the final service will be held at 2:30 and the body of this splendid young man will be laid beside his two brothers and a sister. Mr. and Mrs. Brandhagen have tlie deep sympathy of their frleds all over the county in their great sorrow. President Roosevelt's message to Congress is a long document but it Is an interesting one. He stands firm for rate legislation and other reform measures which calls for a square deal, between the people and the corpora tions and the manufacturers. He Is not radical—he is fair. —If you want the cigar of cigars, wnoke the "Star Crown," a 5 cent Olgar equal to any ten cent cigar •old. 40. *Sa!

The bonds of the company have been placed through the Fort Wayne Electric Company, and the project IB practically completed. Ureetfliiv With A Definite Purpose. The greatest trouble with the breeding carried on on the farms is that it lacks 'definite purpose, and lacking this one tiling lacks every thing. Breeding animals is not a matter of guess work, not an accident and can be successful only by the use of brains. The first thing for the farmer to determine is what kind of live stock he will make the main feature on his farm—horses, cattle, sheep, or hogs— and the place that he will give to sub ordinate features. To illustrate: If a farmer intends to make milk pro duction the main feature of his farm, he should develop a breed of cows that will give a paying quantity of milk. If he is on a small farm, lias to buy considerable of his feed, wants to make fancy buttermaking his specialty, hits a market for it, and cares little or nothing about beef pro duction then he should b.y all means use the special purpose dairy breeds. If he has broad, flat, rich lands like they have in Holland, capable of growing big grass, there is nothing better for him than the Holstein. If his land is more rolling, produces less grass hut of finer quality, as rolling lands do, then there is nothing bet ter for him than the Jersey. If he has rolling lands that will produce a large quantity of rich grass and his I .. 1WCM V* J# & (ftlU UH PHIM John Anderson, Furniture and A A A :^CV r~. -n, THANKSGIVING Suits for Men $8 to $30 The great trouble with the dual purpose farmer is that when he buys a bull he wants a bull of pronounced beef type, because it looks good, has the broad back, the square form, that delights the beef grower. He must not expect heifers from that bull to be good milkers. They may be, If they take after the dam but the farmer does not kpow whether they will be good or not until he under takes to milk them. Therefore If you are buying a bull of the dual pur pose breeds, stick to your milking type. We hope the time will soon come when breeders who milk their cows will weigh the milk, test it, keep records, and thus be able to point out to farmers the type of bull that they should purchase. So in every other line of breeding stock. First determine the kind of stock you are going to raise, then de termine the special object for which you are going to grow them then select the type of animal that will accomplish that purpose, and stick to that. Don't ever allow yourself to be diverted from that definite purpose. If you follow this line, you will suc ceed. If you don't do it, you will fail, and will deserve to fail. Noth ing is ever accomplished in the way of farming or anything else without having a definite purpose in view and keeping everlasting at it.—Wallaces' Farmer. _______________ The members of Co.

Whatever breed he selects he should stick to the one breed. Don't cross Ayrshire with Jersey, nor either of them with Holstein. Select the breed for its adaptation to your purpose, and then stick to it. In selecting sires select only pure bred sires. Don't be tempted to buy a grade be cause it is a good looker, or because it has all the marks of the breed. You can't depend upon grade breeding. Occasionally you will find one that breeds up, but you don't know it until you try it, and you can't afford to take the risk. Buy only animals that you know are pure bred. Then buy sires that inherit milking'qual ities, whose dams are heavy milkers. You can't be too careful along this line. If you are following mixed farming and are dairying only Incidentally, having as the main end in view the production of beef, then you don't want these special purpose breeds at all neither do you want a beef breed. You want a breed that will give you a paying quantity of milk, and good beef steers or heifers. You need a dual purpose breed. You can have Shorthorns of a pronounced milking quality. Don't say you can't get them. Don't say there is no such breed. You can get them if you will go to some pains to And them. Having selected this dual purpose type of Short-horn cow, or Polled Durham, or Bed Poll, don't spoil it all by buying a bull of some pronounc ed beef type. Here is where farmers fall down. A heifer of good dairy type may not make a profitable milk cow, but the chances are she will the heifer of pronounced beef type may make a profitable milk cow, but the chances are she will not. $35 All of these coats are guaranteed. •fiA 80c to .*.",.00 50c to *2.00 25c to $2.00 25c to $2.50 For Xnias presents we have a iiui' assort ment of Smoking Jackets, Fancy Vests, Fancy Suspenders, Mufflers, etc, etc. to $45 Seeley & Tank, Proprietors mm. Worthing Items December (i, 1905. Picking corn from sun till sun, may not he what, .liuimie Ilazen Hyde would call fun: but it brings in tlie "mun." We will say that we, or last week's items were somewhat unfortunate, for we had gotten a "nice bunch" of them as the fellows say, and entered the postortice to mail them, when lo! they were missing, actually lost, so our readers did not read them—after the proof reader had scanned them, but perhaps someone found them and read tlieni in the original, how ever, we will jog our memory and repeat one or two of them. Have vou joined the Lincoln coun ty Roosevelt Republican Club, or read it's platform? Evan Jones lias sold the lot on which it stands, and what is fam iliarly known as, "Tlie Corner Store" building, now occupied as a general store by James Clark, to J. M. Solso. Consideration $3,200. Mr. Solso in tends to move into his new possess ion about January 1st, and fumor says that Mr. Clark may move his stock into the building lately vacated by H. C. Hofmeister & Son. The store building now occupied by J. M. Solso, is owned by John Ilues boe, who will again enter the iner chantile business when Mr. Solso vacates the building. II. C. Hofmeister & Son have de cided to discontinue their furniture store, which they purchased lately from Andrew Solso, and last Friday, moved the furniture to their Lennox store, and the store building is for rent. While in Canton a few days ago, we saw Mrs. Bankson, mother of tlie young man who was injured in a game of base ball played here last summer, and we are glad to say that she informed us that her son Paul has regained his health, and picked corn all fall, and also that he did not lose the sight of one of his eyes, as we were previously informed, but that the sight of both his eyes are perfect, ana indeed we are glad to so inform our readers. Considerable enjoyment was felt here last week by the depositors of the defunct Lewis Bank where checks were received from Mr. Lewis, mak ing another payment of twenty per cent on deposits. Fifty per cent has been paid and we understand that this additional twenty per cent, mak ing a total of seventy cents on the dollar, is final settlement.

Miss Cora Madden left here Tues day for Canton, where she has accept ed a position In the dry goods depart ment of the Thayer store. She has had considerable experience^ in this line the Corner the employ of Evan Jones, and later with J. A. Redfield & Co., and we congratulate Mr. Thayer on his suc cess in securing her services. We join our readers in wishing Miss Mad den continued success. She will make her home in Canton with Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Redfield and family. Henry Gerber of the firm of Gerber Bros., the hustling real estate agents, left here Monday on the east bound passenger for points in Iowa. A very large gray wolf was seen Tuesday by Fred Hurley and several of his corn pickers, crossing the Brad field farm, just south of the Bushnell farm. Mr. and Mrs. Wes Wilcox are now the proud parents of a ten pound, Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Mr. and Mrs. James Clark visited in Lennox Monday afternoon. We are very sorry to chronicle the death of Richard De Vries who died at his home last Saturday morning. The funeral will be held Thursday morning and interment will be in the cemetery south of Lennox. Richard Reamer returned from White Lake, South Dakota, last Thursday after a stay of five weeks on bis farm near White Lake. He reports the crops in that region ex cellent. That corn went better than fifty bushels to the acre, wheat twenty to thirty and speltz on spring breaking thirty bushels to the acre. We bear nothing but words of praise (or our new barber, Mr. Kling !er, and when asked by the writer tot his list of work, he submltt«*d the following: Haircut, twentyfive cents 905 5^ Marx I Hart SchafFncr sliave. ten cents face massage, twen tyfive cents hair singe, twentyfive cents liair tonic, ten cents dandruff cure, ten cents beard trim, ten cents razors honed, twentyfive sissors sharpened, twentyfive cents Sunday shave, fifteen cents, and also mani curing. And this week he is to have a gas plant Installed for lighting pur poses, after which he will have a first class barber shop. Mr. Klingler owns his shop and dwelling which he bought from Mr. Heggie, and has come to stav, therefore don't fail to patronize him. In spite of the ract that the roads were in a condition almost impassa ble, and the mercury hovering close to the zero mark, the Wendt Orches tra .n Canton made its second appear ance to a fair sized but appreciative audience in the opera house, last Fri day night. The orchestra consisting of twentytwo members with Prof. Indseth in possession of the baton, rendered as a curtain raiser, John Phillips Sousa's "The Stars and Stripes Forever," Each number was loudly encored, and st» on until the last number 011 the program, and so keen was the interest and great the satisfaction to all, that we think but verv few noticed when accidently Judge Forrest, the combination man dropped his triangle beater. Miss Da vies, our popular high school teach er, who rendered the readings, more than pleased the audience, beginning with the heavy Aux Italians by Owen Meredith, with Mrs. Dr. Kerr, presiding at the organ, in represent ation of the L'Trouvador, and we think that even the members of the Wendt Orchestra will not for get her—in English: "YesBillie Do." Just before the last number of the musicale, Judge Forrest spoke a few well chosen words in behalf of the orchestra, after which the last num ber was listened to and all went home with only words of praise for the Wendt Orchestra. Tuesday afternoon Fred Hurley re ceived a telephone message from Lennox announcing the death of his grandfather, Mr. Thomas Tanian, of Vanceburg, Ky., and the same even ing Mr. and Mrs. Hurley and their brothers, Thomas, Melvin and Henry, who are here assisting Mr. Hurley, drove to Lennox to console their grief stricken mother, who, on account of her health, was unable to go to the death bed of her father in Kentucky. Mr. Tanian was born in Ireland in 1831, where he learned the blacksmith trade as an apprentice, and later worked at the trade as journeyman, after which he came to this country, married and settled in Kentucky. He served bis country during the civil war as a blacksmith in the army, re maining till the close of the war. He was a man of very powerful physique, and the father of nine children, two of whom are dead and six of them were at his bedside when he died. Mrs. Jeremiah Hurley of Lennox, is the second eldest. The funer al took place at his late home-last Sunday. -Save Timo and time is moneyfor everyone these days.
