Every recommendation embodied in ihe document had to do with compre hensive plans for strengthening the national defenses.

SHAIV TEI.I.S U. S. TO SPEMJ TWO BILLIONS FOR DGPBNSCI Special to The Telegraph Xew York, Dec. 7.—George Bernard Shaw's advice to the United States is "to build thirty-two dreadnaughts in stead of sixteen, and to spend $2,000,- 000,000 on its armament program in stead of SI.000,000,000."

D. C., Dec. 7. —Secre- tary has replied to Germany that the American government's re quest for the withdrawal of Captain Boy-Ed and Captain von Papen. the naval and military attaches, respect , ively, of the German embassy here. I was entirely because of their military and naval activities. , Neither was there any indication of | whether the renly would meet the con . tention of the German government, ithat it should know the reasons for the request for the withdrawal of its officers. It was broadly intimated to the State Department that if the request was ; based on something else than the de velopments of the Hamburg-American Line conspiracy trial or the case of James F. J. Archbald, the American war correspondent, who secretly car ried dispatches for Captain von Papen. Germany would decline to withdraw either of the men. The general Impression was that Secretary Lansing's reply at some length repeats that the two officers have become persona non grata be cause of their military and naval ac tivities and that, further, under the diplomatic usages existing between na tions. it is unnecessary for one govern ment to do more than intimate to an other that the presence of a diplomatic officer is distasteful. The Department of Justice is still" investigating reports that German agents were back of alleged plans for a counter-revolution in Mexico, to be headed by General Huerta. Attorney General Gregory said to-day. however, that no new information on the sub ject had been called to his attention recently. One reason why the American gov ernment will not furnish Germany with specific reasons for the request for the recall of Captain Boy-Kd and Captain von Papen is its determination to keep secret the sources of its in formation. Reports involving other men in this < ountr> are under investi gation and these the government does not desire to disclose until it is ready to take further action.

Snowden Marshall de clared to-day that Franz Von Rintelen the German agent, who is accused of coming to this country to incite the strikers in munition factories, armed with a large corruption fund, was "double-crossed" by the labor men he tried to corrupt and, despite the ex penditure ot several hundred thousand dollars, failed to accomplish his mis sion in any effective manner. Mr. Marshall gave the major credit for Rintelen's failure to the stand taken by high officials in labor organ izations. "Rintelen only succeeded in cor rupting some subordinates," Mr. Mar shall said, "and he was beautifully double-crossed. The real labor lead ers took prompt steps to check his activities. Save for a few small strikes, none of his efforts was suc cessful and all the strikes he did Insti gate were quickly killed by the good men a tthe head of the unions. T am not prepared to state just how much money Rintelen expended, hut it ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars. He had $500,000 to his credit in one bank." Mr. Marshall refused to comment on David Lamar's activities in the scheme beyond saying emphatically that he would not be called as a witness be fore the grand jury, a proceeding which might give him Immunity from prosecution. "If sufficient evidence is obtained it is expected indictments will be sought against the labor men who accepted Rintelen's money. Mr. Mar shall stated that these men could be prosecuted under the Sherman law on the ground that they had conspired to restrain the trado of the United States in munitions. Rintelen is at present a prisoner by the British authorities in the Tower of London."
