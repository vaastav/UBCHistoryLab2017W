We were surprised to hear, a few days af ter our remarks, Oct. 19, on Bishop Hop kins' reply to the protest of Bishop Potter and his associates, that the Bishop charged us with treating him unfairly, by implying tbt his letter to the Philadelphia men was identical with the one written by him to the New York men, Jan. 30, 1S01 From all that we bad then seen in the Philadelphia papers we supposed there was no difference, none at least worth noticing, between them. "We find however that certain narns-nir.h I n i which were in the letter of Jan 30, 1S01, ! were left out of the one written to the Phil- ' adelpbians. How much the omission amount-"! ed to will be seen present v. I i e take the following letters from the ! Philadelphia Inparer of Sept. 2. PniLiOixrniA, April 15, 16C3. Right Reverend Sir ; Tour Tiews on the Scriptural aspect of Slavery, contained in a letter addressed by you to some gentlemen in New York, shortly before the breaking out of the war, has come to our notice, and been perused with much satis faction and profit We believe that false teachings on this subject have bad a great deal to do with bringing on the unhappy strife between the two sections of our common country, and that a lamentable degree of ignorance prevails in regard to it It is of the deepest importance to the public welfare that a sound public opinion should exist on this topic. Believing that the communication of your views, as a Christian Bishop, on the scriptural aspect of Slavery may contribute to this desirable result, we respectfully venture to beg that you will favor us with them, and permit us to make them pub lic v7e are, with great respect.

CHARLES J. BlDDLE. P. -McCau. To the Right Rev. JobsHexkt JIorKi.vs, Burlington, Vt- rnr cisiior's ren.t. BntuxGTO.i, Vt., May 2, 1SS3. My Dear Sirs ; The pamphlet published in Jan nary, 1561, to which you have so kindly refer red, i; at your service, in its original form, as I have net frond in the numerous answers which It has drawn forth anr reason for rhanr-inp- mv opinion. On the contrary, those answers ' .afcn'-Vhfv. TJ coniic,ieo ,0 ,h sanction wbicb the scriptures give to the pnnei- pie of negru slavery, so long as il i- administer ed in aooonlnce with the precepts laid down by ' Aiiu-. iMicn was tne universal doctrine or i iimstian ministers, Christian lawyers and Chris tian sutesnien one hundred years ago, with a few exceptions which only proved the rule. The Constitution of the United States, as I firmly be lieve, made no concessions on tie subject which were not warranted by the Bible. And there fore, w bile I should reiotce in the adoption of any plan of gradual abolition which could be ac cepted peacefully by general consent, I cannot see mat we nave any right to interfere with the doaestie institutions of ihe South tW hf tin. I ... j 1Irc Puo(iri. ,i im mis unti introduc tion, I proceed to the v ery serious question which your friendly application has submitted for dis cussion. Your faithful servant in Christ. Jonx H. Horci.vs, Bishop of the Diocese of Vermont Here wc notieo in the fin-t place, that though the request of the Philadelphia men to Bishop Hopkins is of the same gencr.il tenor as that of the New York men, which lea to the "Bible view of slat ery" dated Jan. 30, 1S6I. there is one difference be tween the two. The laet said "We therefore respectfully ask you to favor us with your opinioD upon the scriptural au thority for slavery, and the constitutional position nf the contending parties." The clause which we have put in italics, does not appear in the Philadelphia request. Most likely it was thought that, as the times arc, the Bishop's answer would do better a. an electioneering document, if the sect sh part of it was left out. In the next place it will be noticed that in the Bishop's answer given above, he begins by telling the Philadelphia men that his "pamphlet published in Jan. 1861" is at their "semce d ifj original form," &c, (the italics are ours), thus in substance reasserting to them its opinions throughout, and giving them leave to make use of the whole if they saw tit. Proceeding then, as he says," to the very serious question which your friendly application has submit ted for discussion," he follows with the very language, paragraph for paragraph, of the letter of Jan. 30, 1861,from begining to end, leaving off only an introductory sentence, one of mere courtesy, and omitting the par agraphs in the latter part of it, written in direct answer to a request which was not repeated in the letter from Philadelphia, and of course called for 310 answer. Whether, under the circumstance, that omission makes any material change in the position of Bishop Hopkjns before the chris tian and political public, we leave every one to judge for himself. Wc add for public information, that "So. 8 of the" papers from the Society for the dif fusion of Political Knowledge President, Prof. S. F. B. Morse ; Secretary, Wm. Mc Murray ; Treorurer.Loring Andrews ; Office of the SoaetySo. 13, Park row.Xew York ; C. Mason, corresponding Secretary to whom all communications may be addressed," is entitled "Bible view of slavery," and agrees verbatim with the letter of May 2. 15S3 to the Philadelphians, cave that it Ins no introductory remarks. It is however signed "your faithful servant in Christ John H. Hopkins, Bishop of the Diocese of Vermont." It has no date. Loss or the Isaac Xewto.v. The splendid Hudson Biver Steamer Isaac Aetcton, for many years a favorite with the travelling public, was destroyed by explosion and fire on Saturday eveninc last near Yonkers. The paasenger. were at supper when an explo sion of some eort drove fire and steam into the room. Six persons are reported as scalded to death and tnurs severely. The steamer took fire, and only the providential nearness of -the steamer Daniel E. JlfiZer at the time of the disaster prevented an awful destruction of life; other craft also soon came. As it was most of the pasxengers and crew were saved. The Isaac Newton and a large freight were totally destroyed. CEO. f For the Free Presx.

I deem the matter of sol lating Elections. . I TotinE " of Inuch 'nT0""1" tbt " But a few line, are occupied by the Constitn-' f the State, generally deny them the privilege a ' r . I. - .1 ,., .ftVir. T'.sn!H.IiC. tion. while fifteen mi of the General Statutes I are filled with these regulations. The Constitution declares that Etptt nun 1 of the full are of twentv-one rears, havinc re- , .ided in thU State for the spice of one whole i year next before the election of representatives, j and is of a quiet and peaceable behavior, and will take the following oath or affirmation, shall be entitled to all the nrivile.-es, of a freeman of this State." The General Statutes declare that " Every such citizen shall have a right to vote for repre sentative to the General Assembly and Justices of the Peace in the town where he shall have re sided tor the term of three mouths next preceding the day of election." There is no such restrict ion in the Constitution. The "three months " residence is not eves alluJed to, and the Legis lature has actually deprived a man of bis fran chise to whom the Constitution has granted the right if he has lived in the Sute ne whole year next before the election, unless he has resided in some town fArre monthi. The Constitution doe not determine in what a man's residence consists, nor does it declare how long a freeman must reside in a town, in order to have a right to vote there, whether it shall be a nonth or a day. The Legislature has assumed the right to eupply the i omission by affirming that ' the town, in which the family of any person shall reside, if he his one, shall be deemed the place of residence of , such person," and requires that his residence in ' a town must be of three months' duration in j order that he may enjoy the privilege of voting. J hy oo not taose wno are so me, aooui allowing . soldiers to Tote, labor to brine the State law into exact conformity with the Constitution ' Why supply those important omissions Manifestly because right and common sense demand it Again; the Constitution requires that the State officers .hall be elected by the " freemen of each town," &c. The Laos say that, tor State officers the vote may be given 41 in any town within the State," and nobody complains of the provision. Again; the Constitution requires that the bal lot shall have the name fairly vcritte n." The law says it shall be "written or printed." What right had the Legislature to allow printed votes ? I presume that our law-makers supposed it to be in harmony with the SDt'rif of the Constitu tion, though not in accordance with the letter. Xo doubt the fathers would have inserted the words " or printed " if they bad thought of it, or if they had supposed printing presses would be so numerous and accessible. At aU events, the Legislature supplied an important emmioa. Was this action constitutional? Once more; the Constitution requires the voer to " bring in" hi! vote to the " Constable." The Legislature has extended the privilege. The vote may be handed to the ' presiding officer", who may be one of the " selectmen." The Constitution allows any resident of the State of quiet and peaceable behavior" who shall take the prescribed oath, all the pnv ileges of a freeman, but the Late put the case of ch a freeman into the hands at the selr tmcn and justices, who may refuse Use freeman permis- sion to take the oath. T:,, constitution oiitn 10 declare by whom the fitaees of the candidate tr the oath sbill t determined, the LegitU- ture has supplied the craisston. If a citizen removes from the State, and re turns to it, after a year's abstaee, he mast not only take the oath, called the " freeman's oath" but also " the oath to support the eoestitutMn of the United States." A person refusing to take the latter oath, notwithstanding our Con stitution says he may, cannot, by the Law. be Trfrmitt ti eninv the nrintp-M f & frmn.n Now if the Legislature can supply omissions. and multiply the eonaitiens of full citizenship, beyond the requirements of the Constitution, why cannot the same power provide for the tak ing of the votes of absent citizens ? From what I have already quoted from the constitution, it is evident that its framers did intend that all the citizens of the State should be permitted to enjoy the full rights of freemen, and equally. The State sends some thousands of her noblest and purest freemen beyond its borders to defend the imperilled Government The men are enlisted tinder its authority, offi cered, and controlled to a great extent, by the Governor, not only while here, but while absent in the field. To all legal intents these soldiers are still resident. Their families are here, and tiry are here, legally and practically. They have no right of suffrage but as citizens resident in this Sute. If the Legislature is competent to declare that where a man's family lives, there is his residence, is it competent to declare if it were necessary, which it is not that our soldiers are residents of the State, and of the towns, and as such, to offer them an op portunity to vote, by " bringing in" their votes to " special constables," appointed for that pur pose' Whose rights are infringed by the Law 7 The Constitution describes, in part, the tiaie and method .of elections in towns. The law cannot deprive a town of its constitutional rights, but because the constitution neglected to prescribe a method of taking the votes of absent citizens, does it therefore follow that the Legis lature cannot supply the deficiency, especially since it has done this in other respects Does making provision for taking the votes of soldiers in any way, or to any extent, affect the rights of tourns 7 Does not the constitution intend that all should vote who are qualified, and is it not accordant with its whole spirit that its best citizens should be allowed the frseman's privi leges? I do not forget that the Committee on Elec tions reported against the constitutionality of a Bill providing fjr soldiers' voting, nor that a leading member of the Houao, the only man who spoke against the Bill, took the bold posi tion that any man cf cemmon cense" might know that the BUI was unconstitutional, appv rcntly forgetting that our accomplished Gover nor had recommended the matter to the Legisla ture. I am not unaware that the editor of the leading Democratic journal of the State has been "informed that the Judges will not decide the Law constitutional," the Law .which finally pawed. I presume that the Editor referred'to, did not regard that information as very bad netct. Some cf the Judges are of Democratic antecedents, and I do not know what their pres ent sympathies are, but I have been in the habit of regarding our Judges as men of enlarged and liberal spirit, of no ntrrow contracted views, cr cold sympathies. Should they, unfortunately, deprive by their decision, our brave citizen sol diers cf the right of suffrage wnieh no sine man can believes our fathers intended to deny then, I hope they will furnish such reasons for their de cision as will satisfy the judgment, if not the hearts of all of us. Judges are men. They may err. They cften do. We have little res pect for the opinions of Messrs. Woodward & Co., of Penn., nor have we forgotten the infa mous dicta of Judze Taney and his confreres, 1 upon the Dred Scott case, but the opinions of ! our able Judges will be entitled to great weight, 1 because of the really great .weight of character i which they have so richly earned. I am surprised that the Republican Press cf the State should manifest such indifference to this subject. I do sot know of but one, and that the lively and spirited Newport Aria, which hu even alluded to the natter with any haTt - Perhaps it is becaue they are aU men or common sense " and are moreover so ao- ' "i r ... 0.
