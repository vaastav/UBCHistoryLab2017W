CITIZEN JO 18 OIM J AMERICAN CITIZEN. L rr HERE AND THERE. Caciu Cbokat, who witnessed tbe death of Napoleon I. and who was the original tl the " Olliecr on Guard " in Steuben's well known enfrraving, has just died at Edinburgh, a General, of 91 years of age. Thb San Lois Valley, in Colorado, being rapidly populated by Mormons proselyted in the Southern States. They agree to obey the laws of Colorado pro hibiting polygamy, and pet their lands direct from the State at a low price. A Japanese correspondent of the San Francisco Bulletin ascribes the exquisite effects produced by the Japanese in the marter-' of 'garden illumination to the display of lights in. groups among the branches of trees, instead of in rows, as is usual with us.. A LADT in Lowdes Connty, Ala., who hail once been wealthy, but is now poor, clipped her magnificent suit of hair and gave it to the yellow-fever sufferers. It realized a large sum, and the winner, a Northern, lady, sent the hair back to the donor. Sinee then the lady has given the hair to the Hood fund, and it was raffled in Montgomery for $ 80. The residence of Sir Edward Thorn' ton, at the British Legation, recently erected by Her Majesty's Government is becoming one of the most attractive features of society in Washington. Fre quently during the winter months Sir tdward gives large . parties and recep lions, at which may be seen the more prominent Washington and foreign fash ionables. Lady Thornton and her two daughters. Miss Thornton and Miss Fannie Thornton, are very popular in V sshington society circles. Mrs. Theresa Gceck died recently Sn Cheyenne, Wy, T-, under , circum stances that rendered necessary the im paneling of a Coroner's Jury. Mary C. Graham, Elsie H. Conroy, Lizzie A. Abney, Isabella Wilford, Augusta Hoi schmidt, and Sarah Casper were sum moned and sworn. They listened to the testimony and rendered a verdict in ac cordance with the facts. This is the first instance in history of a Coroner's Jury composed exclusively of women. Middleiicry College, Vermont, is bound to preserve discipline whether school keeps or not, and at present it looks as if school would not keep. The whole school has been suspended, and the college finds itself in the rather pe culiar position of not having a single student. A member of the sophomore class was disciplined, whereupon the whole class refused to attend the exer cises, and afterwards the freshman, junior and senior classes also "struck." Tbey were all promptly seat home, and if they do not come to time, they will all be expelled. Ia this case Middle bury College will be virtually at an end. So the contest will be closely watched by all interested in educational matters. Ah Association has been formed in "Westphalia for the extinction of poverty throughout the world. The theory of its promoters, who are not Socialists, is that the wants of mankind have so in creased of late years that luxuries are now looked upon even by the poorest classes as Accessaries. : Life, it is urged, may be sustained and comfort insured at a trifling cost by simply putting aside the superfluities of modern existence. This . object can only be attained by a complete revolution in bur social and domestic habits. Children should be trained from their earliest Infancy .to look for no other shelter than that af forded by wooden huts. Their food should consist only of bread and vegeta bles, aad their drink of pore water. The style of modern clothing, as regards both men and women, is condemned as extravagant, barbarous, and nnwhole , Vrne. One thick garment of good ma V" fial .for winter, and one of slighter texture lor summer, is ail tnat is re quired. It is estimated that under good management oo the new system $50 a year will be a sufficient income for any person to exist upon comfortably, and will leave a small margin which, if laid aside annually and carefully invested, will amply provide for all the reasonable wants of old age. Mr. Moodt and Mr. Sankey met first at a prayer-meeting. The singing was poor, and a friend of Mr. Sankey's urged him to start a hymn after the next prayer, lie did so, the people took it up and it helped to make the meeting successful. Alter it. was over, . Mr. Moody sent for him. He did Hot say," says Mr. Sankey, " 'How do you do?' or ' I am glad to see you, or any thing. He took me by the hand, though, and immediately said: I have been look ing for you for eight years. Where do you live?' I told him. 'How old are you?' I told him how old I was, and he asked: Are you married?' 'Yes. How many children have you got?' One.' Well, I want you to leave your home and come to Chicago, I have got a place for you. . You must come, for there is a work that the Lord wants you to do, and yo must do it.' Well, two months paed, I guess, and he wrote me so much that 1 finally went to Chi cago, sang for him in his church, and have been with him ever since." Railway Birds. ) An engine) driver on one of the Scotch lines reports that he has noticed that certain hawks of the merlin or " stone falcon " species make use of the pass ing of the trains for predatory pnrposes They fly close behind the train, near tbe grotrnd, partly hidden by the smoke, but carefully watching for the small birds which, frightened by the train as it rushes roaring past, fly up in ! wil dered shoals; the merlins then, while the little birds are thinking more of the train than Of lurking foes, swoop on them from the ambush of, the smoke, and strike them down with ease. If they nii.is, they return to the wake of the carriages and resnme their flight and their hunt. They can, it seems, eailykcp pace with an express train, sud outstrip it when they please.

The frreat revival of trade. In ternal and foreiKTi, supply during the eominr year its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attemtttitur further ex perimental measures with -the coinage. I would, however, stronjny urge upou Uonirress tbe Importance of authorizing the Seorctary of the Treasu nr to susnend tbe coinsira of silver didlars upon the present lefral ratio. Tbe market value of the silver liar bet nir uiiiformlv and Iarrelv kui than the market value of the pold dollar. It Is obviously Impracticable to mttntain them at par with each othor If both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin ,s forced Into circulation It will, if coined without limit. Soon beenme the nol KtnntlurH .f vului. nnil thus defeat the desired object, which is a cur rency oi ootn rota and stiver, which shall ix- r equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the anivcrsally-recogiilzed money of the world. The retirement from circulation of Cnitcd Btatea Botes, with tbe capacity of lejml toitdur In private oontrauTs, Is a sten to be taken in our proa-reps toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted, as tbo policy and duty of tbe Government and the Interest and security of the people. Tff H'tny firm conviction that the issue of the lejral-tender paper money, based wholly upon the authori ty and credit of tbe Guremment, rxc,)t in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, aad a violation of sound finan cial principles. The issue of United States notes during1 the late civil war, with the ca pacity of leiral tender between private indi viduals, was not authorized exce pt as a means of rescuinir the country from imminent peril. Tbe circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the ac complishment of this purpose was not contem plated by the framers of tbe laws under which tbey were issued. They anticipated tbe re demption aad withdrawal of tbese notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment oi the object for which inev were nnivineo. 'inn noiier or tun i tilt ed States steadily adhered to from the adop tion of tbe Constitution has been to avoid the creation ox a A at tonal debt, and when, from necessity, in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. w iiu mm view, ana ior wis - pur Eose, ft is recommended that the existing lws for the accumulation of a sinking-fund sufficient to extinjruish the public debt within s limited period be maintained. If any change of tbe objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessarj by Congress, It Is miioefted that ex perience has shown tbat a duty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to tbe consumer, and which will add several millions of -dollars an nually to tbe Treasury THE SUPHHKSSIOIf OT POXTGAlir. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citi sensof tbe Territory of Utah of tbe laws of the United States fortbeprosecutkHi and pun ishment of polygamy merits the attention of every department of the Government. This Territory has a population sulhcicnt to entitle It to admission as a State. The general Interest of tbe Nation, as well as tbe welfare of the citizens of thu Ter ritory, require its advance from the Territorial form of government to the respon sibilities and privileges of a State. This tm- gortant change will not, however, be approved y the country while tbe citizens of Utah, In very considerable numbers, uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime bv the laws of sll civilized communities throughout tbe world. Tbe law- for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but bas remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory off Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. , The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah tbat the law was In contravention of the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The Su preme Court of the United States has decided tbe law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding, as a rule of action, for nil who resided within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent In its provisions, it should be i amended; and. In aid of the purpo.e j In view, I recommend that more com prehensive and more searching methods foi preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure oliedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of tbe rights and privileges of citizenship In the Territories of the United States may be with held or withdrawn from those who violate oi oppose the enforcement of tbe law on this sub ject. Tbe elections of the past year, thou gb occupied only with State oitices, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions wbieb attended them all over the count ty new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great ody of citizens take in the progress of tho country toward a more gen eral and complete establishment, at what ever eost, of universal security and free dom In the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topiesof political concern demand great attention from our people, both in tbe sphere of Nations! and State authority. 1 find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed In my last annual messare, that no temporary or administrative Interests of Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever destroy Ifre seal of our people In defence of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opuiioo will override all political prejudices and all snctioiutl and State arrarbmetrts In demanding that all nvrr our wide territory the nam and character of citizen of tbe United States Khali mean one and tbe name ttilnv. auirl t r-w with thom f. challenged neurity and respect. earnestly: piriuunnf! uineiiigenee and patriotism of ; all good Htnen off ev-ry part or the country, however mu h tbey may lie divide ,r opin ion on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedieuce to existing laws aimed at tbe protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfftilly urge upon Congress to supply as shown, and which It Is within Its power to remedy. I again Invoke the co-operation of the Kxecuttve and legislative authorities of the States in tbU great purpose. I am fully convinced tbt if the public mind can Im n"t at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no Rerious obrmiclo will thwart or delay the complete pacification (,f the country, or retard tbe general diffusion of prosperfty. tub mvrr, nr.nvicn.

The views I have hereto- rore exprcseu concerning tho defects and abuses in our civil ailministration remain un chnngeil, exi-ept In so far ns an enlarged ex perience has deepened my sense of the fluty bothtf i)fnrers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils ami perils of a p.irtlsan ppoU system of ap pointment tt otH.-b and oilier tenure are now genera 11 v recognized In the resolu tions of the prerit parlies. In the report i or Leparfmetits,mihc debutes and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Hxeoiitives, tbe gravity of these nvtl hun leon rwiimwf oui. itnu tne neeu oi ineir reform nas been uo mitteu. locoinmand the neces-sarv nuDDort every measure of reform must lie bused on common riKht and justice, and- must be ootnpat ible with the hcalt by ex ist ence oi great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free. State. When the people nave nprtrovo't ft policy at National elect ion, confldchoe In the offi cers they have ticlctd, ftml the ad visers who, in aeeornance with our political In stitutitms, should be commltcd in ihe policy Which It Is their dutv to enrrv into efTect. U iiv. dispetisable. It I e'minently proper that they Bnuiiiu explain it. net ore tne people, as well as Illustrate its spirit in tho prrtormaiicc of their otncial dutfes. It hardly netd p. pointed out that very different considerations npplv to the greater iiutnlter of those who til.- tbe sunortiinaie places in tbo civil service. Their responsibility Is to their superi ors In ollicial position. It IS their duty to uin-y idu icgiii msiniciitni or laosc upon Whom that authority Isdevolx ed, nnd their best public service consists In the discharge of their functions Irrrsooetive of nartisnn ool ities. Their duties are the same ivhntcver party is m power, and whatever poitcv pre vails. As a consciiiciipi!, it follows that' their tcnureoi oinvc shoura not depend iiioii tne prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most uscriilh.qi.ite ineifpcviive oi pnnisau interests, l ne sr. me con si derations that snottia govern tne tenors should als) prevail In the appointment, dis cipline and removal of these subordinates. The authority of ammmtment and removal la not a perquisite which may leused to aid s xrienu or rcwani a partisan, nm is a trust in be exercised in the public Interest, under aU the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for put the pur poses. Every citizen has an equal riirht to the honor and profit off entering the public service of bis country. The only Just ground of dis crimination is the measure ot character and capacity he bus to make tbat service most use ful to the people. Except In e:ises where, upon Jnst and reeoB nized principles, as upon the theory of pen sions, efticcs and promotions nre bestowed as rewards fornast servie-s, iheir ttestowal upon any tne-rry wnien uisregarus personal merit is an act t iniustice to tne citizen, as wen as a bresch of that trnft subject to which the ap- pointihr power is held, in tbeiiKbtot th-s principles it becomes of great fuiiKirtanee to provide jnt and adepiate means, esH-cially for every department and large administrative office, where pei-sonal discrimination on tbe part of its he id is not practicable tor ascer taining tnosc qualifications to w men appoint ment and removals should have reference. To fail to nntvlde such means ! not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the larts iiwu which the most righteous claim to omce ficpeno. uut u necessity to aiw'ountge all worthy aspirants by banding over ap pointments and removals Ki mere fntluence and favoritism. If it i the right off the Worthiest claimant to gain tbe appointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it uwoil linn, if, v i tini in vii ni tii. i m and just method of ascertaining per sonal litness for ftice must ueels tie lmnortant ami m'rmuiient I u net ion of every just and wis (government. It bas long since become Impossible in the great of Oces for those having the duty of noinluation and .ippotutmcnt t personally examine iito the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking oihcc, and itn tne enlargement oi tivii iM-rviceiuai pro- oortioii must continue to lieeoine less. In the earlier years of tbe Government the si il -ordinal colli ces were so few in uuhiIht that it was quite easy for those makingappointmcnts and promotions to personally Hcertainthe merits of candidates, l'arty managers ami methods had not then become powerful agents of co ercion hostile to the free and just exercise of tbe appo inting power. A large and respon sible part off the duty of restoring the Civil Service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon tho President; and it bas been my purpose to do what is within my power to ad vance sncb prudent and gradual measures off reform as will most surely ami rapidly bring about that radical change of system es-ontial to make our administrative methods sat isfactory to a free and intelligent Feople by a proper exercise of authority, t is in the power of the Executivelo do much to promote such a reform, but it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate con lie accomplished without co-operation on the part of Congress, and considerate and in telligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally accepted theo ries of parties and demand changes in the methods of departments are not the work of a bty. - TfaHr permanent foundation must lie laid in sound principles and in au experience which demonstrates their wldom andexposeJ the errors of their Adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his of ficial action an honor to his country. But the people themselves, fat mine than their olHcera in public station, are interested ta a pure, eco nomical and vigorous Administration. By laws enacted in 1M1 and 1HV, and now in sub stance incorporated in the Kc vised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary apiadntinents to the several subordinate grades in the great le partments was condemned, and examina tions as to capacity, to be conducted by the iVpart mental Hoards of Examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to the public service. Tbese stat utcs arc a de cision by Congress that examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are essen tial to the well-being of thu public serv ice. The import nnt questions since the enactment of these laws hrive teen as to tbe character of these examinations, sud whether official favor and partisan intiuence, or common right and merit were to control the access to the exami nations. In practice tbese examina tions have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to lie examined. Official favoritism and S artisan iiiituencc. as a rule, appear to have esignated those who alone were permitted to go liefore the Examining Boards, subjecting , even the Examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates vcrv difficult to re sist. As a consequence, the standard of ad mission fell below tbat which tbe public In terest demanded. It was almost inevitable tbat a system which provided for various separate Hoards of Examiners, with no com mon supervision or uniform method of pro cedure, should result in confusion, inconsist ency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and more radical change was obviously re quired. In the unnnal message of Decem ber, 1870, my predecessor declared that "there Is no duty which so much embar rasses the Executive and heads of Depart ments as that of apMiintmcnis. nor is there any such arduous duties and thankless labor im posed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for comditueuts. The pre, ent system docs not secure the best men. and often not even tit men, for the public places. The elevation and purilicalion of tbe Civil Service of tbe Government will be hailed wltb pprovni by the whole people of the United States." Congress nA--c-ordf i ik ly passed the act approved March 3, 1H7I, "To regulate the Cfvlf Service of the United states ana promote tbe i ftieiency thereof," girtng tne neeesaary authority to the Executive toinaugiirateaCiv-ll-fierrice reform. Acting under this statute, wbicn was interpreted as intended to secure a system of Just ami effectual examinations un der uniform supervision, s numler of emi nently competent persons were selected for the purpose, wbo entered wltb zeal upon the discharge of tbcfr duties, prepared with an in tellh'eut appreolation of the requirements of the service and the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who. In their capacity as a Hoard, hine leen known as thu t'lvil-Service Commission. Congress for t wo years appropriated the money needed for the compeiiKHtion and for the expense of curry" on the work of the Commis sion. It appears from the rcjiort of the Com mission, submitted to the President in April. h:4, that examinations had been held iu virions sections of the country, and Ibat an appropriation f dout $..i"0 would lie re- qilin d to meet the litllllinl expense, ill' lll'l illg snhirics. Involved In dicharirinir-the duties of the CotiiniKsioti. The report n as transmitted t 'on i; rest t,v special im-sfiaKe of April Is, 174. 1th the" following favornblr comment upon the labors of the Commission: lf sus t ni tied iy ('iingi-oss, I bare no doubt the rules can, after Ihe cxerieiiee g:iiitcd, he so Improved nnd enforcod a to mill ni'iri' tnuM rtaiiy benefit the public Service, and relieve the Executive, mem Iters ot Congress and the beads of Departments from intlticnci-s preju dicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have re sit 1 ted beneficially, as is shown 1 y the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their sutiordiiiatc in the Depart ments, and In tha opinio-- I ron rur. And Jti , the animal mi-ssage Oi Ierember off ihe same iar similar views are expressed and an appropriation lor con tinuing the work of the Commission again ad vised. The appropriation was not made, and, as a consequence, the active wrk of - taS Commission was suspended, leaving the Com mission itself still in existence without tbe means then-fore of causing qualification to be tested In any systematic manner, or of se curing for the public service the advan tages of competition upon any extensive phut, L recommended In tnv annual messnge of cemlMTi lS77th making of an appropria tion forthe resumption of the work of the ; Commission. In the tuealitime, however. competitive cxamiimtions, under many em- i tiarmssuieiits, have neon eointucieu wnnin limited spheres in the Executive iH'partinents In Washington, and in a number or tne. cu tom-houacs aud post-offices of the prin cipal cities of the country, with S vleW to further test theif effects, and in everV instance thev have been found to tie as salutary as they are stated to have been under the Administration of my predecessor.

Will lie followed by similar action on the part of other Treaty Powers. The attention of Con gress is nrain Inv-ted to the subject of the in demnity funds received .some yeats since from Japan and China, which, witb their accumu lated Interest, now amount to considerable sums. If any part of those funds is justly due. to American citlscns, tbey should receive it promptly, and whatever may have lieen received by this Government in e'xress of ft riet ly Just demands should in some form bo re turned to the nations to whom H equitaHv be longs.

Jt ff A gratification to be able to Annottnr; thst,throtif;h the judicious and energetic ac tion of the military commanders of the two nations on either side of tbe Klo Grande, tinder tho lust runt ions of their re spective Governments, raids nnd depre dations have greatly decreased, anil. In ha-ali-ties where they were formerly most destruc tive, have now almost wholly ceased, in view of this result, I entertain a confident expecta tion that the continuance of this prevalence of Qiiict on the border wili soou lieci an e so as sured as to justify a modification of the pres ent ordors to our military commanders as to crossing the border without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of f tbe two countries. . The third Installment of tho award against Me.fk'O under the t'laiuis Commission of July 4,1, was duly paid, nnd bas been put in course of distribution In pursuance of the act of Congress providing for Hie same. This sai isChctory situation between the two countries cads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico, and an Increased contribu tion of capital mid industry by our people to tho development of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom of Congress t he provision off suitable legisla tion hiokiiig to this result. Diplomatic intercourse- with Colombia is again fully restored by the arrival of the Minister from that country to the United States. This is csieeiaHy fortuunt.e in view of the fact that tbe question of an inter-oeeanie ' canal has recently assumed n new and impor tant aspect and is now under discussion with the Cent rat American tx)untriesttbrougb whose territory the canal by the Nicaragua route won Id have to pans It Is trusted that enlight ened statesmanship' on their part will see that the early prosecution, of such a work will larsely Inure to the ben efit, not only of their own citizens and those of tbe United States, but of the commerce of tne civilized world. It Is not doubted that, should the work beiindertaken under the pro tective, mispiees of th United States, and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of . way and its security by tbe CciitnilAinei ican Governments, the capital for its completion would readily be furnished from Ibis countrv and Europe, which jnijfht, failing such jrntir antees, prove inaccessible. Diplomat lc" rela tions witb Chili have also been strengthened by the receptfon of a Minister from that country. The war between Peru, Itolivia and Chili still continues. The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose hi the mat ter, further than, to convey to all tho Gov ernments concerned the assurance that the friendly offices of tbe Government of the United States for tho restoration of peace upon an honorable toasis will fie extended in case tho belligerent shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cnrdial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine Republic, and trade witb those countries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequent mail communication in our ships lictweeu the ports of this country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress as an essential precursor of nn enlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our earryhig trade. . A n.'ccut revolution ia Venezuela has I icon followed by the establishment of a Provisional Government. This Government has not yet been formally recognized, and it is dfcmed desirable to await the proosed action of tbe people, which is expected to give it the sanc tion of constitutional forms. A tmvsil v I hna boon sent tn tho Rnmon Islands to make survevs ami take iMissesiou or the privileges ceded to the i' tilted Mates by Samoa in the HartMir of Pago-Pago. A coaling station Is to lie established there, which will be convenient and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relations witb lEmimanta and Scrvia, now become inde pendent sovereignties, is at present under consideration, nnd is the subject of diplomatic corresimnde ee. There is a gratitying increase oi traue who. nearlv all European and American oountrica. and it H believed that wilh judicious action in regard, to its development it can and wilt be still more ennanceo, ami mat American pn Mlucts and manufactures will find new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic mui eonKiilar officer imon this subject, un der the system now adopted, have resulted In obtaining much valuable inlorination. which has been ana win continue to ne lata ficfore Cougrcfrs and tbe public from timet- time. The third artfele of the treaty witb Ktissiaor Hatch 3-1, 1WT, by which Alaska wus ceded to the United Stales, provides thnt the inhab itants of the ceiled territory, witb the excep tion of the uncivilized nai ive iribi s, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the Cnitcd States, and shall be inaiutautod and protected in the free enjoy ment of their lilierty, of property and re ligion. The uncivih.ed tribes are subject to such laws and regulations as the United States may from time to lime adopt in regard to tho alKirlginni trities of , that country.

THF! 

XAVV. The report of the Secretary of tho Nnvy shows a continued improvement hi that branch Of the service during the last fiscal year. Ex tensive repairs have been made Upon vessels, and two new ships have lieen- completed and made ready for sea. The total expenditures of the year ended June .'0. 1S7H, including specific appropriations not estimated for by the De partment, were 1.555,; lo.nii. The expenses chargeable to the year, after dcducriiur the amount of these specific appropria tions, were ?M.'t:t.;. 17.75; but this Is sub ject to a reduction of $:ci,725.Ji9, that amount having tM?en drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year, qhe amount ofuppropriations applicable to the last fiscal year was ?I4,5-'is,4(i.i7. There Was, therefore, a balance of l,47H,tffi4.;i7 remaining unex pended and to the credit of the Iepartnient on June :0. The estimates for the vear ending June 11, are $l4,SM,U;.!f, which exceeds the appropriations for the prtrsent fis cal year :Hil,ii7.3H. The reason for this in crease is explained in the Secretary's- rejmrt. The appn -print ions ava ilnble for 1 he present fis cal year are U.rtc!,?foM'7, which will, in the opinion of the Secretary, answer all the or dinary demands or the sen-ice. The amount drawn from the Troasurv from July I to November I, 1879, was J5.770.4O4.12, off which $l.tKi5.440.u;t has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period f 4.1.74. 9!.7'-. if the expenditures for the remaining two-thirds of 1 be yr-ar do not exceed the proportion for thepe four months, there will remain unex pended at the end of the year $477,;i7JJW of the current appropriations. The report of the Secretary shows the grati fying fact that, among allthedisbursfngoftieors of the Pay Corps of the Navy, there is not ono who Is a defaulter to the extent of a single dol lar. I unite with hfrn in recommending the removal of the Observntorv to a more health ful location. That institution reflects credit Usm the Nation, nnd has obtained the appro- iiittioiioi seienuuc uu-n in au parts oi iiiu world. Tts removal from its present locality won hi not -only lie conducive to the health of j its oiliecrs and Professors, but would greatly increase its usefulness. OKI' A HTM ENT OF .llTPTIfK. The appropriation for judicial expenses, heretofoio made for tho Department of Justice in gross, was sutidividcd at tbe last ses sion of Congress, and no appropriation what- ever was made for the payment of the fees of Marshals and Iheir deputies, either In the ser vice of processor for the discharge of other duties, and since June ;9 these officers bave continued tbe performance of Iheir duties withcut compensation from the Government, taking U'Htn themselves the necessary inci- nentai outlays, as weu as rendering their own services. Jn only a few unavoidable instances has the prom execution of' the process of the Unitiil States failed by reason of the absence off the requisite appropriations, 'i nis course or om- cial conduct on the part of tin officers, highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised by the Attorney-General, who informed them, how ever, that I hey would necessarily bave to rely Ior their compensation upon the pros.e:t or. future legislation by Congress. I therefore esMclally recommend tbot immediate appro priation be made by Congress for this pur pose, 'ine act inn Ring the prmeioai aoprouria- tion fortbe Department of Justice at previous sessions nas uniiormiy con t amen ine ioi low ing clause: "And for defraying the expenses which mnv be incurred in tbe enforcement ot the act approved Feb. 2H, 1S7U, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved Mav IN70.' en titled An net to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to 'vote in the several States of the United States, and for other our poses or any acts amendatory thereof or supplementary tnereto. jso appropriation was made for this purpose for the current year. As no general elc tion f i r mem tiers of Ci ingress occurred, the omission was a matter of little prac tical importance. Sucb election will, however, take place during the ensuing year, and ttie appropriation made for the pay of Marshals and 1 leput ies should be sufficient to embrace couiH'usation for the services they may it required to perforin tit such elect hm. The business of tbe Supreme Court is at pres ent largely in arrears. It cannot tie expected that more causes can be decided than are now disposed ol in its annual session, or that by any assiduity the distinguished Magistrates who compose the Court can accomplish more than is now done. In the courts of many of the circuits also th business has increased to such an extent tbat the oelay of just'eo will call the attentiou of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is be lieved tbat all is done in each circuit which can f airly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are less heavily felt bvthe United States thanbv private suitors, as Its causes are advanced by the poiu-ts when it Is seen that tbey involve tbe discussions of questions of n public character. The remedy suggested iy the Attorney-General is the ap pointment of additional Circuit Judges, and the creation of an intermediate Court of Er rors and Appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme, Court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained lor the performance of circuit duties. I recommend this suggestion to the consideration of Con gress. It- would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional Circuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure at the present rate of salaries of not more than 960,110 a year, which would certainly be small In comparison with the objects to be attained. TUB lONT-OKFI('IC. Tho report of the I'ostmaster-General fienrs testimony to the general revival of business throughout the country.

Bo as to ap ply to all other dutiable articles received in ihe mails from foreign countries . tii K inisna The reports of ihe Secretary of the inferior nd of tbe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, an- Setting forth the present state of our relations witb the Indian trities ou our territory, the measures taken to advance tbir ei ilixatiou ami prnsM'rity, nnd the progret already acbievil by them, will be found of more tnn ordinary interest. The general conduct nf our Indian population has been so sat isfactory that the occurrence of two disturbances which resulted in bloodflhrd and destruction of property in all tbe more to be lamented. The history of the outbreak oh tbe White Itiver Ute Iteserva tion in Western Colorado has become so far mi liar by elaliornte reports in the public Eressthat Its remarkable incidents need not e stateil here in detail. It is expected that the settlement of this difficulty will lead to such arrangements as Will prevent fuither hostile contests ttetween tUt Indians oiid the border settlements In Western Colorado. The other disturbances oc curred at- the" Mercalero Agency in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a small band of marauders, after commit ting many atrocities, beinir vigorously chased by a military force, made bis way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil. While these occurrences, in wbieb a compara tively small miiiiltcr of I ud inns were engaged, are most deplorable, a vat majority of our In dian population have fully justilied the ex pectations of those who t relievo fhat by hu mane and peaceful Influences tbe Indian can be led to abandon the habits of savage life, and to develop a capacity for useful ami c;ivilJzed occupations. What they have already accom plished is shown in the pursuit of agricul tural and mechanical work, Thu re markable success which bas attend ed the experiment of employing as freight ers a class of Indians hitherto counted among the wildest and most intractable, and the general and urgent desire expressed by them for Ihe education of their children, may be taken as sufficient proof that they will bo found capable of accomplishing much moro If they continue to be wisely and fairly guided. The Indian policy sketched in the report of tbe Secretary of the interior, tbe object of which is to make liberal provision for the education of Indian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm-lots in soeralty, to frive them title In fee to their farms nalienable for a certain hiimtier off years and when their wants are thus provided for to disose by sale of the lands on their reser vations not occupied and used by them, a fund to Ire formed out of the proceeds for the bene fit of the Indians, which will gradually relieve the Government of the expeuses now provided for hy annual appropriations, must commend Itself as just and beneficial to the Indian, and as also calculated to remove those obj St ructions which the existence of large n-ser-vations presents to the settlement and devel opment of the country. 1 therefore earnest ly recommend the enactment of a lswetmblinj; the Government to give Indians a, title in fee inalienable for twenty-five years to tbe farm ! lands assigned to them by allotment. I also t repeat the recommendation in my first annual , message tnat a law ne passeu au mining In diana who can give satisfactory proof of hav ing, by their own lafior. supported their fami lies for a number of years, and who are will ing to detach themselves from their tribal re lations, to tne nenent or tne-itontesiean act. and to grant them patents containing tbe sit mo provision of inalienability for a certain period. The experiment of bending a number of Indian children of both sexes to the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute In Virginia, to receive elementary Knglfsh education nnd practical instruction in farming mm om useful Industries, has led to results no promis ing that it was thought expedient tii turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsyl vania, to the Interior Depart incut for the establishment of an Indian school on a larger scale. This school has now ! pupils, scieciea from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements are also made for tho educa tion of a number of Indian boys and girls be longing to tribes on the Pacific slope in a simi lar manner, at Forest Groe, in Oregon. These institutions will commend themselves to tbe liberality of Congress and to tbe philanthropic munificence of tbe American people. Last snrfnir Information was received off th organization of an extensive movement in the Western States, tne object, oi wnien was iuo Occupation by unauthorized persons of cer tain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by the Cberokees to the Government for the pur pose of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the S-ithof April I issued a proclamation warning all persons against participation In such an nttempt, and by Ihe co-operation of a military force the invasion was promptly checked. It is my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian inbabitantsof that Territo ry to the full extent of the Executive; but It would lie unwise to Ignore the fact that a Territory so large and so fertile, with a popu lation so sparse, and so great a wealtb of un usued resources, will be found more exposed to the repetition of such attemps as hap pened this year when the surrounding States were most densely settled, and the westward movement of our population looked still more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Undei Such circumstances the difficulty tf main taining tbe Indian Territory Iu its present state will great iv increase, and the Indian tribes Inhabiting It would do well to prepare for such a continirencv. tncreiore, tuny approve of the advice given to tnem oy the Secretary of tbe Interior on a reoent oc casion to divide among themselves, in sever alty, as large a quantity of their lands as tbey cuu cultivate, to acquire individual title iu fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and consider in what manner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government for their Iienefit. lly adopt ing sucb a policy they would more certainly secure for themselves the value of their pos sessions, and at the same time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity thuu try endeavoring to perpetuate tbo present State of things in the Territory. The question whether a change In the con trol of the Indian service should be made was, in the Forty-fifth Congress, referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses for inquiry and re port. Iu tny last annual message 1 expressed the hope tbat the decision of that question, then in prospect, would arrst further agita tion of this subject, such agitation I vein apt to produce a disturbing effect upon thescrvice as well as the Indianstbemselves. Sinrethen, the Committee having reported, the question has been decided in I he negat i ve by a vot e in t he House of Representatives. For the reason here stated, nnd in view of the fact that fur ther uncertainty on this point will be calcu lated to obstruct other much-needed legisla tion, to weaken the discipline of the service and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government and improve ment of the Indians, 1 respectfully recom mend that the decision arrived at by Congress at its fast session In permitted to stand.
