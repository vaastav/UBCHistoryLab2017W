Semi-Weekly Interior Journal Stanford, Ky., Deci:muf.k11, 1891 W. F. WALTON. Thk democratic caucus on the ."Oth ballot' nominated Charles F. Crisp, of Georgia, for Speaker of the House, the vote stauding, Crisp 11!, Mills 10., Springer!, Stevens 1, McMillan having withdrawn on the previous ballot. While we weio for Mills because of his long ervico in the party and his close identification with the policy of tariff reform, it is more than probable that the election of Crisp is better for the democratic party. Mr. Mills is a very high strum: man, excitawe to a naui;""'" "w" and liable to go oil' half cocked anytime. -Crisp, while spirited enough, is muh more eyeuly poised,. md not half so easily rattled, l'.eeil said if Mills were- chosen Speaker he would have him so mad in a week that he would he throwing the gavel at him. It would not have been quite so bad ns that, but those who know Mr. Mills best say his high temper is his besetting sin. Mr. Crisp is a Gov. McCreary kind of a man and well equipped for the position with a good voice, cool head and line presence. He Is the best suited of any of the candidates for the pluce and the predictions that he will make a presiding officer worthy to be clawed with Carlisle, aro sure of fulfillment. The talk about his protective preelections is the merest poppy cock. He is as strong a tariff reformer as the best of us, as his record in and out of Congress will prove. Head what lie says about it himself in another column and banish the thought that tarifl reform has received a black eye in his election. On the question of silver he is said to be as conservative as Mills and his lovalty to every principle of democracy is beyond question. On the whole the democrats of the House have done exceedingly well ami made a beginning which augurs well for the futuie of the; party. Thk failure of tho House to organize Monday recalls the fact that tho Congress of 1S:M0 took 12 days to elect a Speaker, when It. M. T. Hunter, of Virginia, was chosen. John Quiney Adams was chosen temporary chairman of the House during the time. In 1:5411 three weeks were retruired to choose a Speaker, Howell Cobb, democrat, being finally chosen over H. C. AVinMirnn. Ids whitf competitor. InlSooi it took from the first Monday in December to tho same time in February, ISM, to organiie the Houhc, which was finally accomplished by electing Gen. N. P. Banks Speaker. The last failure before the one this week to organize on the liret day of the session was in lSo, when it took "eight weeks, Win. Pennington, of New Jersey, being llnally chosen to preside. Tut: Todd County Progress is evidently not for its home candidate for State librarian, Miss Maud Kirkhain, or it would never have printed that picture, which must be a miserable carricature on her. A woman with tho kind of a face the Progress prints would stand no more chance of being elected librarian than a horrid man in a field of ladies, and Loving Gaines owes it to the lady and to to the public to get a better cut or kill his artist. We are sure no lady with the pretty name of.Maud has a face anything like tho cut, which was evidently made with a rip saw and a cold chisel. Thk of Sing Sing killed M. I). Loppy, the wife murderer, by electricity Monday in a very artistic and satisfactory manner. There was no adc made and not many people knew of the execution till it was all over. The 1.4S5 volts, which were shot through his system for 50 seconds, killed Loppy before he was aware of what was going on. It must be mighty trying on a murderer's nerves to be killed like a dog, with no chance to pardon them in advance of the anticipated jail sentence and fines. It is to be hoped that the executive will not interfere, but will let these "ladies" learn by experience that there are two ways of doing a thing, the right and the wrong wav. The President's Message. Tiik President did not send his message to Congress till Wednesday, when he had dumped a pile of printed pages nearly a fot high on the desks of the two presiding officers. It contains 17,-000 words or nearly 12 columns, ?i inch es long of solid noupatoil. We thought at first to send it to our readers, but wouldn't one in 100 wade through it so we epitomize for tho benefit of those who feel that life is too Bhort to devote so much of it to what one man, and not a very great man at that, has to say. The message begins by calling atten tion to the comprehensive reports of the heads of the departments, especially that of the State, "which has been char acterized by an unusual number of important negotiations and by diplomatic results of a notable and highly beneficial character," including the Hehring Sea matter, reciprocal trado arrangements, the Brazilian revolt, the Italian row and the Chillian revolution. All the blessings, past, present, future and imaginary of tho McKinley hill are expaciated upon and the president almost convinces himself that the iniquitous thingis a blessing in disgust-. On the silver question, as on the tarifl", it is recommended that existing laws be given a chance hetore any mange is made. The free coinage of silver, under existing con litions wnuld disastrously affect our business interests at home and abroad. The silver producers are entitled to just consideration, but they should bear in mind that the government is buying and putting out of the market more than the entire product of our silver mines. I In war ami navv departments are commended and laud and coast defenses recommended. The adoption of smokeless powder and the enlistment of Indians as soldiers are also commended, while the president grows absolutely enthusiastic over the fact that the pension bureau luis passed on and closed during the vear all the claims presented, nAttitill.ctiin.tiii.i ;t ifnu II AA1 Iw.lii.i.l n, ' uui n unmanning ll naa it(uuu nvuiiiu ui the beginning of the year. The president also has a good word for the judiciary and he concurs with the attorney general tiiut tho right in felony cases to it review by the supreme court should he limited. Attention is called to the fact that Canada is doing a thriving business in smuggling to this country and he wants the law amended so as to cover this infraction. P. M. G. Wananuker also comes in for fine words of praise in his management of the department, which the president thinks was never in so gratilying a condition. A long dessertation on the Indian inestion is made, hut nothing new or especially interesting is presented and the pension bureau again comes in for praise. He thinks that the call for$l II,-i)"0,000 to pay pensions the ne.it fiscal year is not extravagant and those who say to the contrary are mistaken. Recommendations for further appropriations for the worthless census bureau aro made and provisions for government of towns in Alaska suggested. The department of agriculture has worked wonders and will continue to frrrili' in lluufillni.iu null tmiirirtiitif... Tho Michigan departure from the usu al method of choosing presidential electors gives the president a chance to in veigh strongly against the "gerrymand make himself n hero or a martyr, but er," and he recommends such regulation that is the best way gentry. to dispose of the ' Or the :.:-' members oi the House oil, answered to their names Monday, J no.
