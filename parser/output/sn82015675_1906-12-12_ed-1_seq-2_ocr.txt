Such a contention will not stand the test of either law or reason. An organization that fosters ana en courages crime, desecrates the home, degrades womanhood, debauches pub lic morals, registers an oath of hos tility to the nation, such as organiza tion is not entitled to have Its repre sentative In the senate of the United States."

President Roosevelt sent to con gress a special message on Porto Rico, which follows: Nor. 21 I visited the liland of Torto Rico, landlnr a Ponee, croHslnff by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and . returning next morning- over the new1 American road from Areclbo to Ponce; ethe aeenery was beautiful, espe cially among the mountains of the Inte rior, which constitutes a veritable tropic flwltserland. 2 could not embark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and can not receive an 'American battleehip. I do not think thie act creditable to ui as a nation, and I earnestly hope that Immediate provision be made to dredge Han Juan harbor. I doubt whether our people as a whole realize the beauty and fertility of Porto Xtioo, and the progress that has been made under its admirable government. "We have Just cause for pride in the char acter of our representatives who have administered the troplo islands which came under our flag as a result of the war with Spain; and of no one of them is thla more true than of Porto Rico. It would be Impossible to wish a more faithful, a more efficient and a more dis interested publio service than that now being rendered in Porto Rloo by those in control of the Insular government. I stopped at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features In every town was the gathering of the school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for education has been noteworthy. The main emphasis, as is eminently wise and proper, has been put upon primary education: but in addition to this there is a normal school, an agri cultural school, three industrial and three hl?h schools. Every effort is being made to serrure not only the benefits of ele mentary education to all the Porto; Ri- rans of the next generation, but also as far as means will permit to train them so that the trd'.istrial. agricultural and co - e-f.ai opportunities of the island ca ' n't - 't'-lin Nt advantage. 1 -j , . -i v-r jrroh struck by the exoel-e- r, , 1' th of the insular police at ('.. , rtien regiment.

In traversing the Island even the most cursory survey leaves the beholder truck with the evident rapid growth in the oulture both of the sugar cane and tobacco. The fruit industry Is also arrowing-. Last year was the most pros perous year that the island has ever known before or since the American oc cupation. Th total of exports and im ports of the island was $45,000, 000. agaJnat tU.OOQ.000 In 1901. This Is the Hrtreat ta the island's history. Prior to the Amertoan Occupation the greatest trad for aay on year was that of 1896, when it reached nearly $28,000,000. Last year, therefore, there was double the trad that there was In the most pros perous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210.273 tons of sugar export ed last year, of the value of I14.1S6.S19: S3.ei5,ica of tobacco, and 28,290,312 pound of coffee of the value of $3,481, 10t. Unfortunately, what used to be Porto Rico's prime crop coffee haa not shared this prosperity. It has never re covered from th disaster of the hurri cane, and moreover, the benefit of throw ing open our market to It has not eonr peasated for the loss Inflicted by the closing; of the markets to it abroad. I earnestly hope tbat som measure will b taken for th benefit of th excellent and high grade Porto Rican coffee. There is a, matter to which I wish to call your special attention, and that is th desirability of conferring full Ameri can citizenship upon th people of Porto Rico. X most earnestly hope that this will be done. I can not se how any harm can possibly result from it. and it seems to me a matter of right and Jus tice to the people of Porto Rico. Th-y are loyal, they are glad t be under our uwjr are maxing- rapid Droress eioug- th path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of there, our pride in what they hav done, and our pleasure In extending: them rec Bitioo for what ha ben done, bygranUng there fall American cit item-hip. Under the wis administration of the present governor and council, marked progress has been made in the difficult matter of granting to the people of the island the largest measure of self-government that can with safety be given at the present time. It would have been a very serious mistake to have gone anv raster than we have already gone in this direction. The Torto Rlcans have com plete and absolute autonomy in all their municipal governments, th only power ever them poss-ssed by the Insular gov ernment being that of removing corrupt or incompetent municipal official. This power has never been exercised save on the clearest proof of corruption or of In competencesuch ae to jeopardize the Interests of the people 0f the island: and under such circumstances it has been fearlfwly used to the Immense benefit of the reople It Is not a power with which It would be safe, for th .- w .v.. 1st mil itself, to dispense at present The lower house is absolutely elective while the upper house Is appointive." Thii scheme Is working well; no Injustice of !?? . t?Ylt. fTOm nd rat ben efit to the Island, and it should certainly not be changed at this time. The ma chinery of the elections is administered entirely by the Porto Rican people them selves, the governor and council keeoinr only uch supervision as is necessary in order to Insure an orderly electton. Kny protest as to electoral frauds is settled In the courts. Here a-cain it would not be safe to make any change In the pres ent system. The elections this year were absolutely orderly, unaeoonmanled bv any disturbance; and no pretest has been elections. " a-imuifo- imee comeac are threatened where .tn majorities were very small and error was claimed: the contests, of course, to be settled In the courts. In short, th governor and coun cil are co-operating- with all of the mos enlightened and most patriotic of the people of Porto Rico in educating the citizens of the island In the principles of orderly -liberty. .They - are providing- government based upon each citizen's self-respect, and the mutual respect of all citizens; that is, based upon rigid observance of the principle of Justice and honesty. It has not been easy to instill Into the minds of people unaccus tomed to the exercise of freedom the two basic principles of our American system: the principle that the majority must rule, and the principle that the minority has rights which must not be disregarded or trampled upon. Yet real progress has been made in having these principles accepted a3 elementary, as foundations of suceess'ul self-government. All the Insular governments should be placed in one bureau, . either in the de partment of war or the department of state. It ia a mistake not to so arrange our handling ef these island at Wash ing as to be able to take advantage of the experience gained In one, when deal ing with the problems that from time to time arise in another. In conclusion let me express my ad miration for the work done by the con gress when it enacted the law under which the island is now being adminis tered. After seeing the island person ally, and after five years' experience In connection with Its administration, it Is but fair to those who devised this law to say that it would be well-nigh Impos sible to have devised any other which in the actual working would hav accom plished better results.
