Address The Watertown Republican, Watertown, Wisconsin. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 5„ 1900. The Milwaukee wheat market yes terday was stronger, closing at c for No. 1 and 71c fomNo. 2 northern. Flour was steady. Barley closed at 59c. rye at 50c. corn at 35c. and oats at 25|c. Hogs were steady at $4.50@ 4.80. Grain freights were unchanged. It cost Hon. H. B. Dahle $2,089.25 to be re-elected to congress in this district. Of this amount he contri buted $250 to the Republican State Central committee, S2OO each to the Dane and Dodge county committees, and SIOO each to the Jefferson and Columbia county committees. At the coming session of the legis lature an effort will be made to pass a measure providing for assistant county superintendents of schools. It is ar gued that such officials are needed to give proper attention to the country schools, the latter being so numerous and the territory so extensive in some of the counties that the superintend ents are unable to perform their full duties. In Dodge county political circles it is rumored that ex-Sheriff E. J. La buwi. of Rubicon, is bjoked for a big job under the La Follette administra tion. He wants to be a member of the state board of control. It is also said that William Wegwart, of Wood land, and Attorney M. H. Umbreit, of Beaver Dam. are looking for prefer ment, too. and that, in addition to all this, D. P. Doty would like to retain his position as state factory inspector. The last session of the Fifty-sixth congress convened at Washington on Monday. It was a brilliant opening, made markedly prominent by the feel ings of joyful congratulation evinced by the Republicans over the flattering outcome of the national election. And still a veil hung over the whole scene, occasioned by the loss of two such valuable legislators as Senators Davis and Gear. The delivering of the president's message was of course the important feature of the openirg. The document is mainly a concise state ment of governmental affairs and brt few recommendations of moment aie made. The president sees principally a need for reduction in the war taxes, the advancement of our merchant marine, uniform legislation through out the states for the regulation and control of trusts, and the reorganiza tion of the regular army on a basis consistent with our enlarged conditions. The Second Congressional district, which is comprised of the counties of Dane Dodge, Jefferson and Columbia, cast a total vote of 41.986 for con gressman. of which Mr. Dahle received 22,175 and Mr. Aylward 18,799. In most of the Southern states it doesn’t seem to require so many votes to elect representatives, as in South Carolina less than 29.000 votes elected seven congressmen, while in Mississippi it takes still less, as seven congressmen were elected in that state by about 25,000 votes. The “government with the consent of the governed, 11 which was harped upon so vigorously as a campaign issue by the Democrats, seems to operate in a most peculiar way in the sections where Democracy is most dense and it looks as if this principle of human liberty wasn’t be ing so scrupulously observed in the sunny solid South. In ante-bellum days the average Southerner considered himself equal to about live Northern men in military prowess. The South ern citizen of today may not think himself the superior of his Northern brother, bur as far as practical politics is concerned the voter in Dixie has about ten times as much political power as the voter in other parts of the country. This inequality of repre sentation accorded the states of the South is rather striking and should he remedied in some way, and wffien citizens are disfranchised representa tion should be proportionately reduced. —The State.

DASTOniA. j,rs the /p The Kind You Have Always Bough! sfe Washington Letter. i From our Regular Correspondent.! Washington. U. C., Nov. 30. 1900. —President McKinley was too long a member of congress to make the mistake of attempting to dictate to senators and representatives the de tails of the legislation that should be passed at this session of congress, but he talks freely to them of the general legislation he thinks is needed, and he impresses upon their minds that what ever is to be done should be done promptly, as he is particularly anxious that nothing should be left undone that will make an extra session of the next congress necessary, and as all the congressional party leaders are in thorough accord with him everything now indicates that all necessary legis lation will be put through at this ses sion. Rev. Dr. F. M. Bristol, the presi dent’s pastor, said in replying to the toast. ‘-The Mission of the American Republic, 11 at the ninth annual banquet of Burnside post, No. 8, De partment of the Potomac, G. A. R.; “We believe in expansion—the ex pansion of freedom and principle. We believe in imperialism —the imperial ism of right. We believe in sovereign ty—the sovereignty of man. We be lieve in royalty —the royalty of ideas. We believe in the betterment of man, the enthronement of man. We be lieve in the sovereignty of man as man. and the dignity of man as man. the American principle is now and ever will be that man shall no longer be treated as a chattel, but as a king in his own right. We believe in aristoc racy—the aristocracy of the common people, the brotherhood of man. The fact that the Democratic sena tors have the power under existing rules of the senate to prevent needed legislation at this session of congress and force an early extra session of the next congress, if they dare to take the responsibility of exercising it. is caus ing renewed agitation of the expe diency of so amending the senate rules as to give the majority a right to cut off debate on a bill when it is evident that it is being used solely to delay a vote. This agitation isn't new by any means. The same thing has been voted down by the senate any number of times and in many shapes, ihe last time was when Senator Mason s reso lution. providing that after every sen ator had had an opportunity to speak once on a measure the majority might close the debate, was sent to the com mittee on rules to die. by a vote of 32 to 24. Senator Hansbrough strongly favors a rule giving senators the right to move that a \ ote betaken whenever satisfied that delay was being purpose ly indulged in. He said; “Such a rule would make it impossible for any individual senator to prevent a vote, as is now the case, and would give to a majority of the senate the right to decide when a vote shall be had. If this majority believed that the meas ure had not been sufficiently debated, or that undue haste was being shown in the attempt to reach a vote, it would vote down the motion. Other wise. we would secure decisive action without prolonged delay. lam sure that no senator would try to press a measure to a vote if he was shown that such action ought to be postponed for legitimate reasons. 1 ’ From every class in Washington ex pressions of regret for the death of Senator Davis, of Minnesota, are heard. The president will miss him as a friend and valued counselor; the senate will miss him in every conceiv able way, his wide knowledge, person al geniality and long membership hav ing made him one of the leading mem bers of that body, and he will be missed by thousands who loved him and knew him for a true and tried friend. This is Senator Morgan's tribute to his memory: “Cushman K. Davis was my friend; a genial gentle man, a scholar, and a patriot. As chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations. Senator Davis was especially well fitted to assume the responsibilities of such an office, and he nobly fulfilled his tasks, 11 With the death of Senator Davis, Senator Frye, ranking Republican member, became acting chairman of the com mittee on foreign relations, and he will be likely to continue as such dur ing this session of congress. He is in every way fully qualified to fill the position. The death of Senator Davis adds the Minnesota legislature to the number of those that will have thG duty of electing two United States senators to perform at their next ses sion. Governor Lind may, if he sees fit. appoint a senator to serve until the legislature acts, and it is presumed in Washington that he will do so. Secretary Root, who returned from Cuba this week, said of his trip: “I found the people generally peaceful and contented, and pursuing their or dinary avocations. The island is grow ing steadily more prosperous and the people seem to be more satisfied. 11 Having the assurances of a majority of the governments interested that they endorse the attitude, of this gov ernment President McKinley is natural ly confident that the harsh and impos sible demands agreed upon by the foreign ministers at Pekin will be very much modified before they are present ed to China. The agreement of the ministers was subject to the approv al of their respective governments, which under the circumstances leaves things about as though it had never been made. The Best Plaster.

It corresponds to the French “madem oiselle,” to the American “miss.” The use of “senorita” as the Christian name is extraordinary. Down in Ten nessee there is a lady upon, whom her parents bestowed the baptismal desig nation of “senorita” when she was a child. It must be admitted, that the name looks well in print and sounds well when spoken. ‘•Senorita” Alexan der lives at Elizabethton, “in the. coun ty of Carter,” as the official language has it. And what lends additional in terest to the fact is that “Senorita” Alexander has just been appointed and confirmed postmaster at Elizabethton. The word postmaster is used advisedly. Uncle Sam does not recognize officially a “postmistress.” New Rubber Plant. Rubber being in growing demand, scientific men have been trying to ob tain it from plants which had not been available commercially before. Two French chemists, MM. Arnaud and Vernuil, have discovered a proc ess by which it may be obtained from the Landolfia vine, which grows wild and luxuriantly in nearly all parts of Africa. The process of tapping the Landolfia is impracticable as the flow ot rubber harden® too quickly. By the new process the vine is crushed in hot water, by which means all th© rubber it contains is extracted. A Land of Contrasts.
