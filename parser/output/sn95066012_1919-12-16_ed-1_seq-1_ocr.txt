Increase Your Bodily Resistance. Leading physicians are recommend ing various things for the people to do to guard themselves against tho Span ish Influenza epidemic which is ex pected to break out again this fall and winter. They tell you to keep out of crowded places,, avoid being near people who have colds, get out into the sunshine and fresh air and take plenty of exer cise, get to bed early at( night und take a little more sleep and rest than you usually do, eat good, nourishing, wholesome food and tone up your sys tem. Plenty of iron in the blood makes vi tality, strength and resisting power against disease. Iron-Lax-Tcnic Tab lets should be taken without delay as a tonic to tone up the system and put iron into the blood. There is not supposed to be any shortage of this remody at the present time but if you should find a drug store where you cannot buy Iron-Lax-Tonic Tablets, persist until you find a 3tcre that does sell them. It would be well to keep up the treatment for seme weeks. Avoid any substitutes offered when you ask for 1: on Lax-Tonh3 Tablets. It is always ;eary certain you can reasonably look for the expected results only when you inais. on the genuine article. The package of Iron-Lax-Tonic Tablets bears the name of the druggist who originated them, J. T. Lantagne, and :cne other is genuine.
