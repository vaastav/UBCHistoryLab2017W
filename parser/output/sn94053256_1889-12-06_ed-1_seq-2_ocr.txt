4 X THE WATERBURY EVENING DEMOCRAT, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6; 1889. WTw aartrtnri-.IPiRKRTINfi STANLEY WATERBURY, CONN. O. & M. T. Malonky, Proprietors. Ofiick 153 South Main Street.

President Harrison s message is as colorless as his face. There are odd conjunctions in news paper make-ups at times. Immediately following the president's message in the Boston Herald appeared the heading "Chestnuts" in staring capitals. It is officially stated that the extraor dinary demand for small coin, which is now 60 great that the mints are unable to keep up with it, is due to the near approach of the holidays, lnis seems to indicate that inexpensive gifts wil be more popular than diamonds this year. President Harrison s utterances in regard to trusts must be peculiarly in teresting to James G. Blaine. He will observe that trusts are no longer private affairs, with which the public has noth. ng whatever to do, in the opinion of the administration ot wliicn he is a part. Judge Anderson has ruled that the endowment house oath in the Mormon church is incompatible with the oath of allegiance to the constitution of the United States, and that an alien who has taken the former is not fit to become a citizen. Ordinarily no inquiry is made into the religion of an alien who applies for citizenship. But when the applicant openlv vows allegiance to a church which puts itself above the con stitution of the United States and teaches a doctrine whose practice is in violation of the law of the land naturali zation is very properly refused by the courts. To grant it would be to abuse Ameriean citizenship. 

VERMONT'S DESERTED FARMS. Years ago Stephen A. Douglas de clared that Vermont was the best state in the union to move away from. Still the papers published up among the Green Mountains declare that farms there have not been deserted because the climate is severe and the soil has lost its original fertility. Thev sav the people have moved away because they are enterprising. Many have taken up farms in the west for the reason that they could raise larger crops. Vermont is now trying to increase its population and find persons to till its deserted farms by bringing over some colonies of Swedes. They are promised farms at the rate of from 3 to $3 per acre, with the buildings "thrown in. Each family is also to have a present of a cow, a yoke of oxen and some farming tools, lowns will give each ianiily a small sum of monev and help them move from the nearest railway station . The colonists will have a long time in which to pay for the land. 

FEDERAL CONTROL OF ELECTIONS. The republican papers are wondering why President Harrison failed to recom mend federal control of elections, in his message to congress, as per programme laid out. The Iowa State Register (re publican) ot jNovenioer 14, in making a forecast of the message said: "It is stat ed quite positively at Washington that President Harrison will make a very strong recommendation in Ins message to congress in favor of federal control of election, at which congressmen are elect ed. It is to be hoped that he will. A recommendation of that sort would be seconded by all fair-minded people, and appropriate legislation on this subject would be welcomed north and south The republican party is now in a posit ion where it can not stand still and take no action on this subject. It will have control of each branch of the next con gress and it will be held responsible if no attempt is made to secure honest elec tions." At is unnecessary to say that the es teemed Register was a false prophet Persident Harrison consulted Messrs Quay and Clarkson on this important matter and learned that federal control of elections would prove a boomerang to the republican party. Hence is painful Bilence on the matter. 

NOTES ON NOTABLES. Sarah Bernhardt has a magnificent tomb in the cemetery of Fere la Chaise. Sir Charles Russell receives the largest income from his practice of any man in the world and lives like a Prince. Miss Amelia B. Edwards is descend ed from the older branch of the Fitz- Gerald family, whoso head is the Earl of Leicester. . Mr. Edison has been granted 403 patents on his inventions, and has over SCO applications pending. Most of these are electrical devices. Miss Sanger, the President's type writer, is said to be more useful to him than any clerk in his employ. She Is a rapid worker and can copy on her ma chine 120 letters a day. The head of the Mormon church, Pres ident Woodruff, is eighty-two years old. He is solidly built and his head looks like that of General Grant. He wears his hair and beard close cropped and does not have a ministerial air at all. Ct.aka Morris owns a very pretty piece of .property on the line which di vides the city of New York from Yonkers. The boundary divides her bed, and when she is asleep her head rests in New York while her feet are in Tlio Explorer's Triumphal Eutry Iiito Bagamoyo.

He also testified to the Divine influonce which had guided him in his work. Emin then toasted the Kaiser and Lieutenant Stoirs responded for Stan ley's officers.

He Falls Oat of a Window and Fractures His Skull. Zanzibar, Doc. 6. After enduring the hardships of many years' residence in the interior of Africa and the fatigue and dangers of his journey to the sea, it has been the fate of Emin Pasha to re ceive an injury which is likely to result in his death. Ihe Pasha is very near sighted, and habitually wears glasses. yesterday he attempted to go about his room without them and unconsciously walked out of the window, falling some distance to the ground. llo was immediately picked up and convoyed into the house, where it was found that he had sustained a fracture of the skull, which ail the doctors at Bagamoyo. except Stanley's own physi cian, pronounced fatal, fetanloy s doc tor sustains the opinion of his col leagues that Emin is in a very critical condition, but expresses hope that ho may bo able to save his life. As it is the Fasha can not, under the most favorable circustances, be removed from Bagamoyo for at least ten days. Sorry They Villlfled Mrs. Mackay. London, Dec. 0.

After tho hen bill became a law last June ho had field of fine sweet corn, which was coming along nicely. Hens would get into it, however, and ono afternoon ho found a largo patch of the corn ruined. Returning to his houso ho took down his shotgun, loaded it, and, calling on Darius, ho began, patting his gun sig nificantly: "Dan, ef I see any nioro o' your chickens in my corn 111 dispose of 'em to wunst, an' tho law'll uphold mo in it, too. I gin you fair warnin', Dari, that I'm goin' fer 'em every time I see 'em." "But, Stephen " began Darius, m an explanatory tone, hut ho was shut oil by his neighbor, who said: "Now, I don't want any words, lul you don't keep your chickens outen my corn I'll shoot 'em on tho spot, and tho law'll uphold mo in it Tho next morning tho report of tho gun was heard in btephen s corn-uold ana in a lew minutes that party ap proached Darius' houso and throw over tho fence as sleek and plump a rooster as ever scratched up corn-hills for a' numerous harem. Mrs. Darius went oat and picked up tho fowl and at noon tho family enjoyed a chicken-potpie dinner For a week every morning Stephen's gun was heard, and ono or two and sometimes three hens or roosters would ho thrown over into Darius' yard. His wife picked them up, dressed them, and, like all country housewives, dried tho feathers under tho stove and stowed them away for futuro uso in cushions for Darius' arm-chair or pillows for the lounge. What Darius' family, which was a good-sized one, could not eat of the fowls wcro sold to tho marketmcn when they came around, and the good wifo already had a nice littlo sum of money knid by in a broken bluo saucer on tho pastry shelf, which sho expected to de-vote to purchases when sho went into town again. Finally Stephen's wife remarked to him ono evening that her chickens wero disappearing remarkably fast, and sho couldn't understand what caused it. I reckin that blamed fox is around ag'in," said ho, "and I'll lay for him with my gun. I'm gettin' to be quito a shot," and ho chuckled as he remem bered how he had filled Darius' hens with bird shot. Tho next morning he started bright and early lor tho corn field with his trusty gun. There was tho flock scratching "away as usual. Stephen singled out a line rooster and laid him out cold. Picking him up ho proceeded as usual to take him to Darius' yard and fling him over tho fence. Mr3. Darius was in the yard as tho rooster struck tho ground. 'Thank you, Stephen," sho said, as sho picked it up and started for tho house. "Mrs. Darius, how many chickens o' yourn hev I killed in tho last ten days?" asked Stephen. Chickens of ours? Why, Stephen, wo never Kept a chicken m our nvcv said tho woman, while a suppressed smilo crept into !): though her faco was sober enough. Gret Christopher! Han't them your hens I've been shooting all this time?" 'They wcro no'., Stoph.cn, though we have felt grateful to you for your ex ceeding kindness in giving them to us. Wo haven't been obliged to buy any meat in two weeks, though I must con fess wo are getting kind o' tired of chicken, having had thirty of them." Stephen sat down on a stono and re flected, llo remembered his wife's re mark about the disappearance of her chickens, atod, rising, ho took his gun and brought it down with a vim across the top rail of the fence, breaking tho stock off and bending tho barrel. Then he threw tho remains away and went homo. Ho mot his wife in tho yard and told her the story. "I've mado aconsarned old fool o' my self. I thought I was mighty smart to kill them hens, for them fellers over to Hartford passed a law sayin' I could. Gosh dang it, there's thirty hens as fine as ever wuz raised in Fairfield County, and I'vo killed 'em and gin 'em to Dari when ho hadn't no. more right to 'em than ho has to Gabriel's horn. I'll go to town and seo a lawyer, and if tho State of Connecticut don't pay mo for them hens then I'll take tho law on the dod-blasted fool what writ it.'' The Einperor'a T5rotlier-in-Law.

A. manage of cousins is not a Tery amon occurrence, although, there is law yet in effect in the State of Mis-1 iri to prevent it, says a St. Joseph let- tsrtothoSt. Louis Republic. Uaktafj ! advantage of that fact, John R. Lewis, Jr., son of a prominent physician of ot. ' Joseph, recently married Miss Louise Quarles, who is his first, second ana third cousin. Tho story of the mixed relationship is long and interesting, but in brief is as follows: Some years beforo tho late civil war Charles Quarles and John R. Lewis, Sr., who were first cousins, married two sis ters named Johnson at Charlottesville, Ya. When the war broke out Quarles left his wifo and entered the Southern . army. Ho had been away some time , when ho learned that his wifo had given birth to a fine girl baby, but during tho . sickness that followed had died. Tho baby lived, and was taken care of by its dead mother's sister. When tho war closed Quarles returned to his home, " and after a shtrt time married his sister-in-law and his child's aunt. By , this marriago he became the father of several children, and Miss Louise, the young lady married last evening, was ono of them. The second marriago of . Quarles made the child by his first wifa and those by his second wife not only full cousins but half-sisters as wolL, Xiio marriago of tho two cousins to the two sisters made Mr. and Mrs. Lewis first, second and third cousins. Tho marriage of the two sisters to the two cousins mado them first cousins, says ono of tho parties interested, which would make tho children third cousins to their uncles and fourth cousins to each other. In attendance at the wed ding was Mrs. Octavia Cochran, oi Uooneville, Mo., the daughter of Quarles' first wifo and tho cousin and half sister of tho bride. Tho Republic reporter called at tho residence of the bride's mother, whero ho met not only tho mother but two of her sisters. While a portion of them traced the relationship between tho newly-married couple so as to make them first, second and third cousins, the others made it go as far as tho fourth. Whether it goes this far is a matter oi doubt, but there is none whatever about the husoand and wifo being nrst, sec ond and third cousins. Both parties belong to prominent families, who have never taken much interest in tracing the relationship. KAISER AND GRENADIER. An Incident 'Which, Greatly Amused Two J Mighty Kmperors. An amusing incidont took placo at Berlin on tho occasion of the banque I given by tho officers of tho "Kaiser Al Gxander von Russland" regiment to the Czar and to Emperor William, says a Vienna corresponden t of tho Xew York Tribune. During the dinner tho two monarchs, who sat side by side, were served and waited upon by Captain Von Hoyer and tho Lieutenant of tho coloi company. As soon as dessert had beeD put upon tho table tho three officers in question resumed heir seats, cigars wero lighted, and a less constrained and ceremonious tone began to roign among thoso present. When about to lighf a fresh cigar, Emperor William suddenly turned round and asked a stal wart grenadier who was stationed at at tention against the wall just behind the imperial chair to hand him a knife foi tho purposo of cutting off tho cigar-end, Utterly taken aback by the request, tho worthy soldier looked about -him helplessly for a knife. Thera was none to bo obtained from anywhere nearer than the othe? end of tho room. The Emperoi thinking that the man had not heard his request, repeated it in louder and slightly sharper tones. Realizing thai his majesty was '--ecoming impatient . and that there was no time to be lost. tho grenadier, with a look of despera tion on his face, dived into his trou sers pociiet ana nsneo. out a gigantic and somewhat rusty clasp-knifo of the pig-sticking class, and smelling strong ly as if it had been recently used to cut up "wurst. This, after opening, ne handed to the Emperor. The latter, on having such an instrument suddenly and unexpectedly thrust under his im-. perial nose, - started back in alarm, . gazed and sniffed at it for a moment, and then, grasping the whole situation, burst into a roar of laughter in which ho was joined by the Czar and every body elso present, the unfortunate sol dier meanwhile remaining at attention without a muscle of his face moving, but with a look of despair in his eyes. This, however, disappeared when, after cutting off the cigar-end with the jack knifo in question tho Emperor handed it hack to him with a couple of twenty mark gold pieces and the good-humored remark: "Here, my friend, you should keep this knife in future as a souvenir of tho present occasion." Telephones in Austria. Long distance telephonic communica tion was opened on October 1 in Austria between Vienna and Prague, a distance of two hundred and twenty miles. Every subscriber in Vienna can now communicate with Prague, and every word can 1)6 perfectly understood and the voico recognized. In connection with this news the London Star gets rather a good joke on the Dailj News, who first announced the opening. Their correspondent montions as a curi ous fact that it has been observed that those who listen at Prague hear mor clearly than thoso who listen in Vienna, and remarks tho reason has not beep explained. Tho Star heads its para graph, "They speak plainer in Vienna," and says tho reason seems cleai enough. Flexible Paint.
