AT POOR FARM The County Commissioners Made Substantial Improvements There This Year. POOR WELL CARED FOR Gravity Water System and Handsome Addition to Main Building Among the New Things. In summing up the various im provements that the past year has brought forth, the story would be in complete were we not to include those which have been made for the benefit and comfort of those less for tunate than most of us, at the county poor farm, where Fergus county cares for her poor. They reflect great credit on all tax-payers alike; and to Chairman Petersen and the other members of the board of county commissioners is due no small part of this credit, for it is their per sistent efforts to improve conditions at the poor farm that is responsible for the exceptionally high standard to which this institution has been elevated. Some two miles out across the ex pansive flat and on down the hill, across the little wagon bridge that spans Spring Creek as it winds its way along the bottom of the hills and on to the Judith, stretches out the broad acres of the county poor farm. Nearly the entire 160 acres lie in the bottom and is traversed by Spring Creek. The richness of the soil will, some day, when it is all placed in cultivation, make it a veritable garden spot, but cultivation is slow, and probably will be until some method of handling the place by the county can be devised, whereby the person to whom it is rented can receive some assurance that he can have a longer lease than one year The institution as a wihole, how ever, is probably better equipped to care for the inmates than is any sim ilar place in the state, and we might say in the West. There are, no doubt, larger county institutions for the poor, but none have better equipment or more modern appliances. Here one finds a modern gravity system, that carries pure water to every part of the house, which contains fourteen spacious rooms. The house is heated throughout by a modern hot water pliant of more than ample capacity, hot and cold water can be had in any part of the house, several porcelain l oth tubs adorn as many large bath rooms, while electricity furnishes light to every room in the main build ing, and the genera! air of cleanliness of everything m and about the build ing lends a most inviting aspect to the place. On one's first visit noth ing would be more remote from your inmd than that you were entering a western county poor farm. It was two days before Thanks giving when the writer accompanied Owen Biglen, who conducts the place, to the poor farm, not on this par ticular occasion as a prospective in mate, but mainly to note the many improvements, including a large 7 room addition, that have been brought about in the past year. S. S. Hobson, of this city, who owns a large tract of land on the nill. just above the poor farm, is in no small degree responsible for mak ing it possible for the county farm having its perfect gravity water sys !™.,°n ^ r -. Hobson's farm i s a fine bubbling spring of pure water, the acquisition of which was the first necessity to the water system, and Chairman Petersen consulted Mr. Hobson on the subject. Mr. Hob son readily gave the county use of the spring, gratis. After this, it was comparatively easy, and the water was piped down and run into the ho b!' e . *'*t a cost of about $1,000. The addition to the main building consists of seven large rooms, with a large hall through tile center, and a fine 26-foot porch adorns the outside of the new part. The first room to | the left i- the operating room, which is something over 10x12. and will be fitted up with an operating table, which County Physician Wilson has consented to furnish. The room has hot and cold water and all other san itary plumbing devices necessary. Next to the operating room, on the same side, is a bed-room about 13x13, and directly back of this is a large yiving room, 15x17, which is to be occupied bv the keeper and family as a living room. On the opposite side of the hall are four spacious bed-rooms. The dimensions of the addition is 3Qx40, with a large base ment for the heating plant and coal. The floors of the addition are all of maple and the building rests on a substantial foundation of stone. When one considers the contract price for this addition, complete, was only $2,696, including painting and plastering, we are convinced that the commissioners drove a better bargain m this instance than any individual could have secured, and the con tractor, Daly Smith, must be given credit for doing good work. Besides this addition, a large cow barn and a stone chicken house have been erect cd. An addition was also made to the kitchen, which is also used as a din ing room, and is now 18x36, with an exceptionally large amount of day light flooding in from tihe numerous windows. This is one of the most pleasant rooms in the whole build ing, and the scrupulous cleanliness that invades even the hidden corners, betrays the presence of a personage ; : Havei | a only too rarely found in tihe rising generation—a good housekeeper. Mrs. Biglen, who presides over the des tinies of the kitchen, was busy pre paring a number of chickens when the writer was introduced to the lady, and on the polislhed kitchen table were several turkeys, all in prepara tion for the Thanksgiving dinner that was to be for the guests of the county P°° r fatiTi, and it required no stretch of imagination to believe that this elaborate preparation was being made for a banquet of millionaires. The Inmates. There are twenty-seven inmates at the county poor farm at the present time, nearly all of whom are well along in years. Although serene con tentment seems to he the rule when they gather together in 'tihe large wards to smoke and engage in friend ly discussion, the future can hold out but little to them, and ambition must live only in memory. They live wholly in the past, in the days when the sotil was fired with ambition and hope, when the world looked bright and inviting; but long since the re morseless hand of fate, in its un equal distribution of happiness and tears, has dealt unkindly with these men in their declining days, as they ............... .......... R „ „„ pass down the shady side of time to ..... ' ~ the brink of eternity. Some of them might tell you a story of what might have been, had not that fickle siren, luck, intervened at the physiological moment and stacked the cards against them in this game of life. Little blame should be attached to them if at times tihey are possessed of a grouch. They await the close of a life that has come in contact, with the rugged edges of an unsym pathetic world, where life's ambition is too often snuffed out without even a sigh of regret. * Yet the inmates of the poor farm view their position in life philisoph ically, and their existence is made far more pleasant by the many com forts with which they are surrounded by tihe good people of Fergus county.

COMMISSIONERS MAKE ANNUAL REPORT THERE WERE 118 KILLED AND 666 INJURED DURING THE YEAR. Helena, Dec. 5.—The state board of railroad commissioners has sub mitted to Governor Norris its annual report for the period ended Nov. 30. The report touches upon station «nd train service, rates and minimums, train accidents and personal injuries and demurrage. It likewise contains the supreme court decision barring the issuing of free transportation ex cept to employes of carriers, their families and others exempted by the law, as well as the opinions of the attorney-general touching upon sub jects in which the commission had an important interest. All decrees of the commission following hear ings for the adjustment of grievances and claims are also quoted at length. During the year 67 employes were killed and 534 injured in railroad train casualties, while 51 passengers met death and 132 were injured. A brief review of the more important accidents is given, together with the commission's views on t'he block sys tem as a means to minimize the num ber of collisions. Were such a sys tem in vogue, the commission points out, many of the wrecks would have been impossibilities, as no two trains could be in the same block simul taneously. It is admitted that some slight delay might be entailed through the restrictions of trains until the block was cleared, but this, tihe com mission declares, is inconsequential as compared with the sacrifice of human life and property. The commission points out that as a result of the hearing held here on the general demurrage question, at which carriers and shipping interests were largely represented, an amicable understanding on the subject was had, the so-called uniform code be ing adopted virtually in its entirety. In essence, 72 hours are allowable for the loading or unloading of ore, concentrates, lumber, stulls, lagging, coal, coke, lime and lime rock, and 4X hours for all other commodities. The report says that the mileage of new railroads built in Montana since Xnv. 30, 1909, does not signify any material increase over the total mile age a year ago. The St. Paul has taken over the Gallatin Valley elec tric and a 25-mile line ffom Leader to White Sulphur Springs has been completed. The Great Northern has completed a branch from Bainville to Plentywood, but it will not be ready for operation until 1911. The Burling ton has built a 59-mile cut-off from Scribner to Fromberg. The electric headlight is declared an unqualified success, preventing many disasters. Sheriff's Sale. Stephen Thelan, plaintiff, vs. Pearl Williams, defendant.

Rosebud and Yellowstone Washington, Dec. 10.—In the United States and all its possessions the stars and stripes protect 101,100, 000 souls. This is the official estimate of the United States Census bureau, an nounced today in connection with the population statistics for the country, as enumerated in the thirteenth de cennial census. It includes the Philippines, Samoa, Guan, Hawaii and the Panama canal zone. Within its borders on the North American continent, exclusive of Alaska, the United States has a popu lation of 91,972,266. In tihe last 10 years the states of j the Union had an increase in popu lation of 15,977,691, which amounts to ; 21 per cent over the 1900 figures. Since the first census was taken Jn j 1790, the country has grown 25 times j as large, the population then having j been 3,929,214, sligthtly larger than j the present population of Texas. The growth of the country was greater than has been anticipated by the statisticians who have closely watched the progress of tihe United States population, still it was smaller than that scored in any previous de cade except that between 1890 and 1900, when the increase amounted to 20.7 per cent. Between 1860 and 1870, the increase was 22.6 per cent. The largest increase ever shown in any 10 years was that of 36.4 per cent be tween 1800 and 1810. 

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. Light Vote Caused by Obscure Place on Ballot. The only significant feature of the official canvass, says the Helena In dependent, is tihe fact that consider ably less than half of tihe voters of the state voted for the important of fice of chief justice of the supreme court. The figures show that while 65,774 electors voted for congressman j only 31,960 voted for tihe highest ju dicial office in the state. This is gen- j erally attributed to the fact that the nominations were, usually, on an | obscure place on the official ballot j and consequently overlooked by many j who are in the habit of voting a straight ticket. The result of the initial trial of the non-partisan ju diciary law is believed to indicate that the next legislature will modify the law by providing that tihe judicial nominations shall appear on an en tirely separate ballot, the same as constitutional amendments now ap pear, in order that they shall be t/)ted upon by the electors generally. The official canvass shows that Congressman Pray was re-elected by a plurality of 4,448; Clerk of the Su preme Court Athey was re-elected by a plurality of 8,720, and Railroad Commissioner E. A. Morley was re elected by a plurality of 5,761. The constitutional amendment was carried by a plurality of 16,648. Beaverhead—Brantley, 260; Cheadle, 89; Clayberg, 51; Clements, 67.

SUMMARY OF PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE President Taft delivered his message to congress last Tuesday. It was probably tihe most voluminous document ever sent to congress by a president. In its complete form it contained 35,000 words and would make a book of more than 150 pages. This enormous size makes it next to impossible for even the big blanket dailies to publish it com plete all at one time. Below we give a short summary of tihe subjects treated and recommendations advanced: Reciprocity treaty with Canada apparently will soon be concluded Urges prompt action for establishment of an American merchant marine before completion of Panama canal by granting of mail subsidy. Econoy has been practiced by each department dhief and estimates for the year have been cut to the limit. The final estimates for tihe year ending June 30, 1912, amount to $630 - 494,013, or $52,964,887 less than those for the year ending June 30, 19li. These estimates do not include the appropriations for the Panama canl. Declares there are too many customs districts and that many of them should be abolished. ,. Main body of criticism of tariff is based on charge that attempt to conform to tihe policy of protection was not honestly adhered to. Complete review of all schedules of tariff would only repeat evils from which business of country has suffered in times past. Halt in business will be prevented by treating schedules one by one as tariff board is able to make its report. Recommends that president be authorized to fix tolls on Panama canal. Recommends passage of bills now before congress having to do with reducing burden of litigation in courts. Urges passage of bill regulating issuing of injunctions. Thinks it would be wise to put into classified service list first, sec ond and third class postmasters. Urges adoption of parcels' post measure. Recommends congressional recognition of Captain Peary's discovery of the north pole. Recommends a number of changes in the existing land laws. Is in favor of creation of bureau for care of national parks. Recommends giving secretary of agriculture authority to mpet moral obligations of government, such as occurred when employes of forest service were killed or injured during recent forest fires. Has directed attorney-general to proceed against those concerned in census frauds. Recommends holding a negro exposition to commemorate fiftieth an niversary of Lincoln's emancipation proclamation. Protection of railroad employes is subject of highest importance and measures should be adopted looking to prevention of accidents. Suggests appropriation to enable interstate commerce commission to ascertain valuation of all railroads. Fine and imprisonment should be imposed upon railroad agents and shippers for fraud and misrepre sentation in the issue of bills of lading. Does not recommend any amendment to tihe interstate commerce law or to the anti-trust law, as existing regulations with respect to cor porations have reached a point where the country can afford to stop a while and witness the effects of vigorous prosecution of tihe present laws. tUrned ^ tW ° y ° Ung bucks ' The funniest thing about the thing is that nobody says anything about the kill ing for publication. Last week a movement was started (by several prominent business men to organize the First State Bank of Hedgesville.
