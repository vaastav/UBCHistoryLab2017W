Money on coll 4 1-2 per cent. The market was unaffected by the President's Message. The Roosevelt Hospital is an institution exempt from taxation under an act of the i Legislature, but Judge Lawrence decides that this exemption does nut apply to assess ments for local improvements. If the opinion is sustained it will settle a very important principle. The Colliery Explosion in England, if not I so fatal as was at first supposed, was still only too appalling. There ought to be abso lute safety in the mines; but as yet security is far from being attained in the mining re gions, either in Europe or America. Germany Is Still pursuing the policy of Catholic suppression. The latest movement is a demand upon the Archbishop of Cologne to resign. This persecution cannot fail to have a reactionary effect; but while Bismarck lives there is scarcely a hope of its abandon ment The C'uinkse are expressing their disap proval of the recent arrangement made by the government with STr. Wade, the British Minister, by placards posted in the city of I'ekin. This in probably as good a cam's l*Ui as England will },* able to get with China, and as the native officials are dis pleased with the negotiation* a war can bo pro Yoked with comparative ease. Vnseu Fritz.-The letter from Berlin [ which we print this morning holds out the hope that the Crown Prince of Germany may c??e to the Centenniul Exhibition after all, or that, failing to come himself, he will send Lis eldest son. We trust this purpose will *iot be abandoned. The compliment of I'nser Fritz's presence at Philadelphia next Hummer would b? appreciated by every American, and th" prospective nil or of Ger many would receive u in,tit* ?? "koniQ from tf.tw (-.i'i iu im* in ^ The Pr??lde?t*? HI ? The annual Meaaage sent to Congress yes terday touches upon a great variety o 'm portant subjects, and on the greater part o them we are bound to aay that it dtli>ers sound, or. at least, defensible views. But there is one capital exception , one subject on which the recommendations of the President are sheer folly. It un fortunately happens that the sub ject on which tho President is utterly wrong is the one which ho presses with the most vigor and zeal. He is sound on the Cuban question ; sound in the main on the most important of the financial questions ; sound and admirable on the question of cable monopolies ; discreet aud even wrse on the Mexican question; plau sible at least, if not right, on the naturalization question. But on the com bined religious and Bchool question, upon which he lays hia chief stresa and emphasis, he is wild, Quixotio and utterly absurd. This attempt to introduce religion as a con trolling element in our national politics, the zeal with which he flings this firebrand and tries to kindle theological animosities for party effect, is the most mischievous and monstrous violation of fitness and propriety ever perpetrated by a President of the U nited States. The inflammatory question which he thus thrusts into the political arena is entirely outside of his constitutional duties, as he virtually confesses by urging his recom mendations as amendments of the constitu tion. This is a plain acknowledgment that he is overstepping the limits of the constitu tion us it stands at present. It is a well es tablished principle that the President haa no official connection with amendments to the constitution. The President ought to act within the constitution, but not beyond it. When Congress, by a two-thirds majority of each House, proposes amendments to the constitution, their action does not require the approval of the President, as was judici ally decided by the Supreme Court at an early period in our history. Amendments of the constitution are entirely beyond the sphere of Executive action. It is not denied that the President can recommend changes in the constitution if he chooses, but he ought not to do it except on some urgent and manifest necessity. But what is the urgency for such amendments as President Grant presses with all the fervency of bigoted zeal in this Mes sage? There is none whatever. It is a bold and bald attempt to influence religious ani mosities for party purposes, than which nothing could be more inexcusably mis chievous, if the President thinks that Con gress will respect and indorse his views. Slender as President Grant's title may be to rank as a statesman, we must give him credit for common sense, and if he has com mon sense he must know perfectly well that | such amendments to the constitution as he proposes will not be adopted bv this Congress. Such amendments could be adopted only as a party measure, and nobody knows better than he that such a measure could not be carried through either House. It requires a two thirds majority ol both Houses to submit a constitutional amendment to the States for j their ratification, and the republican party has not a two-thirds majority in either branch of Congress. President Grant must know perfectly well that the democrats of the Senate and the democrats of the House will alike make a strenuous and ; successful opposition to such amendments to the constitution as he recommends. Lven if they could be carried through Congress, 1 which is quite impossible, they would bo de feated in the States, since it requires three fourths of the States to ratify a constitu tional amendment, and a majority of the State Legislatures are at present controlled by the democratic party. President Grant . is proposing, and he must know that he is proposing, an utterly impracti cable measure. It is clear that he does not expect the success of his recommen dations, and that he is only aiming to stir up religious strife for mere party effect. He hopes to array the Protestant prejudice and Protestant bigotry in a political crusade against the Catholic Church, and thereby , carry the Presidential election. Ibis unex ampled attempt to enlist religioua rancor on the republican side as a makeweight in the Presidential election is an act of political des peration which public opinion will condemn. The taxing of Church property is a sub ject which may be safely left to the State ? governments, which have exclusive jurisdic tion over it as the federal constitution stands at present. If, in any State, the exemption of such property is oppressive, the people have a remedy in their State Legislatures. It is a question which has no relation to taxation for federal purposes. When Church property is taxed the proceeds go into the State treasury ; if it is exempted nobody suffers but the taxpayers of the State in which the propertv is situated. There is no SEfte in tbe Union in which the Prot cstant population is not in a majority of six i or 6even to one, or in which they cannot, through their local Legislatures, easily redress any injustice which taxpayers may s\;ffer by an exemption of Church property. With so complete a remedy in the bands of the citizens of every .State, it would be a piece of intermeddling folly for the federal government to interfere to protect them against an evil which ia per fectly within their own control. At the end of the Message President Grant, with an affectation of renouncing his third term , aspirations, but in language which does not bind him, says"As this will be the las* annual Message which I shall have the honoN'f transmitting to CongTess before my success** is chosen, I will recapitulate the questions *iJcb I deem of vital impor tance which may' be legislated upon and settled at this session*' .Ha nmke. his re capitulation under five ^n, three of the five re laths g to tie school and Church questions. The President cannot be so lacking in Pol,t,ca intelligence bp to believe thik' religious issue he raises "may be legislaV ^ uI'"ri ftn settled at this session." He must krK)W tlmt there is not the remotest possibility*.'ljilt proposed amendments to the constIv can be passed through Congress at U session, and lie ia trifling with Congress anh tho country when he puts forth such an idva. i+M lut Mwltvvt tlu* jtnamm UJ*ca tion not with any expectation that Congress tjrill take effectual action on it, but solely as a weans of dragging religious animosities into the Presidential canvass. It is the most discreditable appeal ever made by the Chief Magistrate of the country, or by any party | chief, in the history of our politics. i On most of the other subjects referred to in his Message President Grant speaks with sense and wisdom. The Cuban question, respecting which it was fearod he might be rash and aggressive, is treated with remark able good judgment and moderation. He maintains, on sound reasons, that it would be unjustifiable to recognize the independence of the island, and shows that it would be a mistake to con cede belligerent rights to the in surgents in the present state of their affairs. They have no regularly or ganized government, no seaports, no means of intercourse with the nations of the world, and no valid title to any kind of recognition. To treat them as belli gerents would lead to undesirable com plications. It would relieve Spain from all responsibility for injuries they might in flict upon our rights or our commerce, and, what is worse, it would give Spain a right to overhaul and search our merchant ships on the high seas, causing incessant exaspera tion, which might lead to war. We presume this part of the Message was written by Secretary Fish. At any rate, it re flects the conservative views which he has so steadily and consistently maintained. ! The President recognizes and deplores the j injuries which wo suffer in consequence of the disturbed condition of Cuba, and as other nations suffer in the same way, though to a less extent, the President thinks the condition of Cuba a proper subject for th? | friendly intervention of other Powers, with a view to put an end to a strife which in jures Spain as well as all other nations which have an interest in the commerce of the island. Our other difficulties with Spain are the subject of pending negotiations, and the President intimates that he will send another Message on Cuban affairs at a riper stage of the business. All of which, if not quite satisfactory, is at least unobjectionable. We heartily approve and indorse that part of the Message which relates to ocean cables. It is a proper and timely protest against ex tortionate monopolios. The President justly thinks that no foreign company should be permitted to land a cable on our shores with out a right reserved by our government to limit the rates for messages, nor without guarantees against the consolidation of | competing linos and combinations be i twecn them to fleece the community by extortionate prices for messages. On this important subject the President has been wisely advised. The financial part of the Message accords, in the main, with the judi ! cious recommendations of Secretary Bristow in his annual report. We think, however, that the four per cent bonds which Mr. Bris tow recommends for funding the greenbacks would afford a better guarantee of success than the 3 65-100 bonds favored by the j President. Among the minor recommendations of the Message that relating to the Centennial Cel ebration is most likely to be popular. Now that the thing has gone so far it would bring : discredit on the nation to have the Exposi tion fail, and public opinion would indorse I a cautious appropriation of money to make it a success. As such occasions recur only once in a hundred years the precedent could | do little harm. We are sincerely sorry that President [ Grant has made so strenuous an effort to drag religions questions into politics. It is an unworthy electioneering device, which ! will not bear discussion, and which is pretty j certain to react against his own party. The Lou of th? Dentichland. The loss of the steamer Deutsohland is another of those terrible disasters which of late years have been of such frequent occurrence, i Scarcely has the recollection of one catas trophe, with all its attendant horrors, lost its ; hold upon popular sympathy than another : equally appalling follows, with a repetition of the fearful story. In many cases these accidents are directly traceable to prevent able causes, being the results of carelessness or incompetence, but so far as we are advised at present this latest disaster presents none of these features. It is certain, however, that j the steamer at the time ol the accident was out of her course, the scene of the disaster being in the North Sea, eastward of the mouth of the Thames. Our accounts are con flicting as to the exact locality where the | vessel struck, but it was either upon the Glkiiaptl CI KcntitfL JvjiQcJt, and she seems to have drifted westward to Long Sand, j where the captain says she is now lying. | The map which we publish Jo-day gives the j localities of the disaster and shows the dan- j gers which menaced the vessel. The violence | of the gale and the impossibility of keeping her off the dangerous sands in proximity to I her course seem in themselves sufficiently to account for her loss, without any necessity j for imputing blsme Anywhere. It is to be regretted, however, that so few of the pas- I sengers were saved, though the number reported as rescued 1 *ay be very large, when I it is remembered t^ut her signal guns were heard at Hurwich on Monday, but it was impossible to go to her relief. Whatever coloring the details of the disaster may give to the event, the story which we print this morning will lose none of its painful interest, nor will the lessons to be derived from it be in Any way changed. Steam navigation ought to be perfectly safe in the most tempestuous weather, but it too often happens that the pAths of the sea are the ways of death. In this case a powerful steamer is cast away 1 within twenty-four hours of her departure from port and in water where destruction was sure to overtake her. It is possible that no human foresight could have saved her ; but if this is tr ) ere is no real safety in knowledge and seamanship. Previous dis asters have shown that only too much blame attached to the officers of the lost steamships, ? but on this point in the present instance we must suspend judgment until we shall have a more complete command of the facts. If tite Cabi.ists are less troublesome than formerly the Spanish soldiers are finding an unexpected enemy in the weather. Somo of tttud tw IteeuicuAtitt to Uvufcb* Herrotary BrUtow's Report. The great feature of this excellent docu ment is its clear diacussion of the question of npecie payments and its judicious recom mendations relating to that subject. We will begin at once with the most important thing in this important part of the report?that is to say, the recommendations. Assuming that the act of last winter, requiring resump tion on the 1st of January, 1879, ia a pledge which binds the faith of the government, two questions arise?first, whether the means and machinery provided by that act are sufficient; and if they aio not, a second question is presented as to what means would prove adequate. Mr. Bristow considers the provision for resump tion authorized by the act of last winter as entirely insufficient to accomplish the pur pose. In point of fact, it provides no re sources whatever beyond the sale of bonds to accumulate a stock of gold in the Treasury, and it restricts such sales to the par value of the bonds in gold. Now it is quite cer tain that without a change in the market value of bonds this provision is nugatory. The five per cent bonds which the Secretary was authorized to use are barely at par, and they have all been disposed of. The four per cent and the four and a half per cent bonds which alone remain to be employed for this purpose, cannot be sold at par in gold, and there is no likelihood that they will rise to par before the date fixed for re sumption. Now, as no other means have been provided by Congress, and as this re source is not available by reason of the pro hibition to sell the bonds for less than their par value in gold, the legislation of last winter is utterly worthless unless reinforced by new and more efficient measures. It re quires the Secretary of the Treasury to re deem the legal tender notes, on and after January 1,1879, without providing any means that can be called into use for that pur pose. This is the actual situation which Secre tary Bristow asks Congress to face, and the suggestions which he offers for their guidance go so directly to the pith of the matter, and evince so much financial wisdom, as to deserv o the most respectful consideration. One of Secretary Bristow's recommendations, and tho most important ot them all, is the pas sage by Congress of an act authorizing him to fund the outstanding greenbacks in lour per cent bonds. This method would work, whereas the sale of four per cent bonds at par to accumulate a stock of gold will not work, and the law authorizing it is a dead letter. With a premium of fourteen per cent on gold (this was about the rate yester day) there would be a vast difference be tween offering the bonds at their face value in gold and offering them at their face value in greenbacks. The funding is possible, but the sale of the bonds at par in gold is im possible. The steady funding of the greenbacks during the ensuing three years would save tho necessity of a vast accumulation of gold (even if a sufficient accumulation were prac ticable) to begin resumption in 1879. By withdrawing the legal tender notes gradually from circulation their amount would be bo j reduced as to prevent a great amount of them 1 being poured upon the Treasury for redemp- j tion when the date arrives for their payment. By this process their value wonld probably be advanced to par with gold before 1879, precluding a great run upon the Treasury and a sudden convulsion in the business of the country. Such a precautionary meas ure would be wise, even if it were per fectly easy to accumulate a great stock of , gold to meet the exigency of a fixed date for resumption. But a vast accumulation of , gold for that purpose is not easy. Mr. Bris tow states two reasons why it is inexpedient to attempt to manage resumption in that The first objection?important, though a minor one-is the loss of interest on a large j amount of gold lying idle in the Treasury. The necessity for losing interest in that way would be, to a great extent, obviated by a withdrawal of the greenbacks by funding and dispensing with a stock of gold to redeem them. The other objection which Mr. j Bristow makes to accumulating a great hoard of gold to be paid out for le- , cal tender notes all of a sud den in January, 1879, is the motive it would create to obstruct our policy by for eign nations. They would jealously guard their stock of gold from so great a dram, which would derange and unsettle the com merce of the world. It might be in their power to prevent resumption in this coun try, if attempted by ft^thodjrhich would require a 'y&frt Amount of gold to be with draw!^ from the circulation of the world and looked up in the Treasury of the United States. By the process of funding which Secretary Bristow recommends a sufficient amount of greenbacks could be withdrawn to Turing the residue of the greenbacks to par without disturbing the money markets of the world by a great drain of gold, to lie idle in our Treasurv. Another excellent recommendation of Mr. Bristow is the repeal of the Legal Tender act, to take effect January, 1877, two years in ad vance of resumption. He would have such an act apply only to debts contracted after that date. With this limitation it wonld work no injustice to the debtor class, be cause no person would thereafter bny real estate or commodities on credit, except at gold prices. These sound and wholesome recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury will determine the standing and test the sincerity of political parties on the question of resumption. Kvery member of Congress who desires a sound cur rency will cordially support these measures, unless better ones are proposed. If the re publican members do not support them it will be a confession that the act ol last winter, fixing a date for resumption, was a hollow bharn. If the democratic members oppose them without offering something equivalent, they will stamp their party as opponents of resumption. Wo do not believe that either party can offer anything better than tho measures recommended by Secretary Bristow, and if either party shirks the subject it will forfeit public confidence and be placed at a disadvantage in the Presidential election. We have given ho much space to this car 1 dinal part of the report that we must defer j comments on its other features, which are l mwM iu ttat Vt wdiw ruulouj*. Tammany on Its Kai>?i. The dark lantern Know Nothing Tam many lodge on Fourteenth street, which con trols the democratic party and of which William M. Tweed, John Kelly, Harry Genet, Warden Dunham, Tom Dunlap and other democratic Statesmen, more or less in authority, are sachems and members, has had a meeting. That lifelong Tammany saint, Henry L. Clinton, who a little while ago was writing resolutions against 1 am many as a "secret conclave," offered a preamble and resolution setting forth the necessity of a reform of Tammany so as to eliminate its secret feature. According to this recitation Tammany was founded at a time when it waa necessary to prevent the spread of monarchical sentiments in the new Ropublio. "The leading demoojats of that time," says the veracious and consistent Clinton, "believed that the liberties of the nation were or might be imperilled by reason of the secret hostility of many powerful foes to our republican form of government, then in its infancy." In order to make this sure, it was deemed expedient to "keep the pro ceedings secret." Furthermore, says the ac curate Clinton, the society has "for years past taken no action whatever in regard to political affairs, local, State or national, ex cept to hold public celebrations on the Fourth of July in this building, which prop erty it owns." But, to prevent the scandal of secrecy, it is proposed that the delibera tions shall bo open hereafter. So far as this is the expression of a desire to open the deliberations of the dark lantern Know Nothing lodge it will do no harm. The outside world may be amused at the spectacle of John Kelly, Andy Garvey, Au gustus Schell, Tom Dunlap, Matt Brennan and the others marching around a room and calling themselves "Indians," and talking about the "seasons of hunting" and "flow ers," and smoking "calumets ; but the in terest will not last long. There is no reason why these people should not enjoy their tomfoolery if they are so minded. But Mr. Clinton is in error in many respects. He speaks of Tammany as in the old times a bulwark of the constitution and a defenco of the new Republic against the growth of I monarchical sentiments. But lammany seventy years ago was the agent of the dis honest and unholy ambition of Aaron Burr when he intrigued against Jefferson and aimed to throw the country into war and to divide the Union for his own selfish ambi tion. Its career from the time of Burr to that of Tweed has been in keeping. When Mr. Clinton tells us that all the society does in politics is to celebrate the Fourth of July he makes a misstatement surprising in a man who has a regard for veracity. Has Mr. Clinton never heard of the fight of the Young Democracy against Tweed, and how, when Tweed was beaten fairly in the councils of the democracy, ho was enabled to obtain power again by the aid of this very society of Sachems and Sagamores, this Know j Nothing dark lantern crowd which Mr. Clinton would have us believe never had any other aim than to save the Union from tho monarchists ? He must know, too, that it i was because of the victory vouchsafed to Tweed by the secret lodge that he was enabled to perpetrate his gross frauds upon the city, j We do not know any one more familiar with these facts than Mr. Clinton, unless it may be Mr. Wiekham, for they were'both at tho time howling themselves hoarse about the in famies of Tammany to delighted multitudes in Apollo Hall. This whole business is a pretence, and if Mr. Clinton were a man whose moral sense had not been deadened by association with his dark lantern companions he would boldly say so. It is only a step in the right direction. Tammany, open or secret, is Tam many all the same. Its name has become infamous in the eyas of the people without j distinction of party. It represents the trea son of Burr, the rascality of Tweed, the im becility of Wiekham. We do not care to j have anything more to do with it, open or shut. We want tho democratic masses to meet in general convention and select their own rulers. Let us have a party not based on the wishes of Kelly or Tweed or the men who come after them, but a party for the peo ple and by the people, its deliberations as open as the day. Corporation Counsel Whitney, in his ex* amination yesterday before the SenjU*> In vestigating Committee, pointed out how claims against tho city arq, Enforced, even when they were oontracted'm violation of the charter. The different departments are not allowed to rnakg expenditures in excess of their appropriation^, seems that if there is money enough to the credit of the appropriation when tho liability is incurred the courts enforce the claim, notwithstand ing the appropriation is exhausted long before the demand for payment is made. While the laws are so construed it will be impossible to limit the city expenditures. Thx Croton Water.?It may not improve the public taste for cold water to study the account of the Croton watershed which is continued in our paper to-day ; but it enables the people to poison themselves intelligently if they must do it at all. Our report of the dis trict drained for the accumulation of the water with which the city is served exhibits a condition that might be thought scandal ous in the case of some remote, primitive, ignorant people, incapable of comprehending the evil of draining their barnyards into their wells. It seems scarcely conceivablo that the enlightened, intelligent people of this city, taxed as they are, are yet drinking to-day from their flint glass goblets and Sevres teacups the drainage of barnyards, factories, slaughter houses atul even worse places. The Doctors on Malaria.?Our renders should give earnest attention to the opinions given on another page of some of the most distinguished practitioners of medicine in the city on the great prevalence here of mias matic poison and its injurious effect upon the public health. Dr. Alonzo Clark, tho most eminent physician in the country, gives nn opinion on tho Harlem flat system of ! "public improvement" worthy tho atten ? tion of the authorities. Drs. Kay re, Hamilton, Ktephen Smith, Loomis, Jamas K. Wood, , Hammond and John C. Draper, all concur in j the opinion so repeatedly urged in these I ciiluuitiA. tiwtyUiA>yi>?4lttUvaiaiKJourt/nil the post of malarious diseases, and that only perfect sewerage, drainage and a new system of construction can make this a healthy city. HUhop Haven on the Stump. We have a curious despatch from Boston to t le t fleet that on Monday, at a large meeting 0 the Methodist Kpisoopal Sabbath School 1 mon and the Tract Society, and also of th<? eekly I roachers," "a meeting comprising nearly two hundred ministers," "Bishop Haven urged, as a measure of safety to tho Republic, a renomination of General Grant for President" We are also informed that " his remarks were adopted by a unanimous vote. Now, if Bishop Haven wore a t atholio prelato this speech would have been hailed throughout the country with turious disapprobation. But the Bishop is a prelate of the Methodist Church, of which President Grant is an ostentatious if not a sincere, member. Ilis Church is one of tho most powerful in this country. Vigorous in its discipline, untiring in its energy, closely in sympathy with tho masses of our peoplo, carrying its faith to the frontiers and plant ing its churches amid every discouragement, Methodism represents in the Protestant re ligion that missionary proselyting influence which has given Catholicism its marvellous power. Is or do we underrate the importance of a declaration in favor of a third term by a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. It shows that President Grant, when ho mado his extraordinary speech *at Des Moines, knew the sentiment to which he appealed. But we look upon this declaration of the Bishop as deplorable from every point of view. It is a reflection upon his religion and yn interference in our politics that we are sure will be resented by the Methodists themselves. Before tho war slavery was per mitted to divide these great bodies into Northern and Southern denominations. Methodists and Presbyterians have deplored over and over again the fact that, while they we*e one in faith, in their communion and in their discipline ; while they were brothers by every religious tie, slavery was permitted to divide their councils and to rend them asunder. Bishop Haven is leading his church into the same position. If he sup poses that Methodists will, as a general thing, submit to be told by a clergyman, even if ho is a bishop, whose duty it is to win souls to Christ, that they must vote one way or an other, their sense of independence will rebel. In this century one fact is becoming mora and more apparent, namely, that, no matter how reverently the human heart may accept the precepts of religion, there is intelligence enough to lead it to revolt when, under tho name of religion, an attempt is mado to foster political ambition or consolidate political power. The declaration of Bishop Haven in favor of a third term will give new color to the intrigues which have been on foot for some time in favor of a third term. Upon the other hand, it will introduce into our poli tics a question which we do not fear -namely, How far shall priests and bishops be per mitted to use their holy offices to effect politi cal results? Spanish Excitement over President Grant'# Message is very amusing, but it is difficult to understand it. Our special cable despatch from Madrid this morning will surprise most of our readers ; for tho President's ut terances in regard to Cnba could not well hnxe been milder, even if Spanish interest.* and feelings had been consulted. Evidently the young King is making tho most of the difficulty with the United States to excite the patriotism and ardor of his subject*. He must be in a very bad way indeed when his Ministry is compelled to resort to such puer ilities to strengthen Spanish sentiment. It Now Seems that Tim Campbell is nol absent with Tweed. He has been in Wash ington assisting Mayor Wiekham to complete the organization of the democratic party and enjoying the sunny hospitality of Sunset Cox.
