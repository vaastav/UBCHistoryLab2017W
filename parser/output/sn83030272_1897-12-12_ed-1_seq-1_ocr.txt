LAIIQE MEETING IN HONOR Or WEYLKR. Madrid, Dec 11. A great meeting in honor ot Qcn. Wcyler was held here last evening, the objoct of which, besides doing honor to tho late Captain-General ot Cuba, was to reconstruct tho Liberal and Conservative parties. Sixty Sena tors and members of the Chamber of Deputies, many prominent Carlists, and 4,000 provincial politicians were present. SeDor Itomero Hoblcdo presided. Upon taking tho chair Scfior Roblcdo eulogized Gen. Weylor and attacked the Liberals with great severity.

The French system of the 'iV private inquisition of all accused persons goes fjgf'Wry- t out of existence to-day. and the Infamous ffidPJ '"" machinery which Is responsible for many ter- i s9 rlble miscarriages of justice no longer disgraces !( it the country which calls Itself a republic Here- Hj . after prisoners must bo arraigned within JjrJ'A twenty-four hours, and cannot be examined t without the presence of counsel. Curiously enough, the High Court of Paris t "? was occupied to-day with one of the most fright- jBv ful cases of injustice irrowing out of the old JBS system. It was an application (or the rehabllt- 'Hfc tatlon ot two men, Plorre Vaux and Jean Petit, Wg' sontencod In 1832 to bard labor for life on a jjjJI number of cbarcces of arson.

London, Doe. 1L The Increasing soverlty of French competition In tbe West African trade and tho certainty ot the revocation of the Royal Niger Company's charter havo caused the revival ot a sehomo in London, Liver pool, and Glasgow for a great combina tion ot Arms doing business In that part ot the world. It is proposod to take into the trust small as well as largo firms, and the neces sary capital Is ready to buy out tboso linns preferring to bo bought. Tho Minister for the Colonics has aald with regard to tho schema that the Niger Company, which, of course, Is a trading as woll as a govornlng corporation, has already caused him more troublo and worry than nil the rest of Africa by Its grasping mothodsof doing business with tho natives; and another glgantlo combination Is likely to sin in tho samo way if, as it desires, it manages to securo a monopoly ot any particular region. Tho French Foreign Olllce has a prodigiously long list of the Niger Company's mlsdcods 11 1 ml among the departmental archives, and they nro being used with some efleot In tho negotiations now proceeding In Paris. Tho St. Jamtn's Qazctte mado n considerable sensation early In the week by announcing the virtual settlement of the trouble between Eng land and France In tho upper Kilo region, which was announced in those despatches more than n month ago. Tho attaches ot tho Foreign and Colonial Olllccs profess to know nothing about this matter, or, rather, thoy tell tho roportcrs they havo no nows. But the St. James's Qasctte is right. Tho con ditions latoly havo all been favorablo for sotuo such deal. Fronch movements on tbo upper Nile had thoroughly frightened England, and the French Government was beginning to foel that It had gone too far in the Niger region to be ablo to rccodo with honor or dignity. Well-informed persons now admit that tho courago and Ono, far-seeing statesmanship ot that French movo right across Africa havo re sulted in giving M. Hanotaux a weapon which he is now using with discretion and skill. DESlItB XTALT TO JOI.V TUE3T. France and nussla Trjlnsr to Tempt Iter Into Alliance with Them. Special Cable Detpatch to TnK Sex. London, Dec 11. Tho dual alllanco diplomats In Romo havo been utilizing tho unrest In Austria-Hungary ai an argument why Italy should throw her lot with Franco and Russia. An attompt has been mado to pcrsuado Marquis dl Rudlnl first and King Humbert afterward that Francis Josonh's ompiro Is on tho point of bronklng up. King Humbert Is said to havo remarked something to the effect that he had heard that story before, but be Is never flippant, and the reported remark was probably novcr mado. It soems to bo true, however, that the French Ambassador. In tho beat of orgument. recently went bo far as to remind the Italian Prcmlor ot Italy's military woakness, and pointedly re ferred to tho condition of tho artillery. It SIgnor dl Rudlnl entered upon an argument on Btich a subject at all with a foreigner, ho could not truthfully havo declared the Italian artillery to bo In a satisfactory condition, as tho facts are too notorious. There Is reason to bellovo that tho last scheme submitted to the War Department provides for a thorough reorganization of the field artillery nt,s cost of 00,000.000 llro. Whcro the money la to come from nobody has any Idea, least of all the Minister of Finance. Moreover, the transformation will take about eight years, and much may happen in Europe in eight years. lMPOniAXI XHSCOYEItT. A Drlton Anlrme That the India Offloe Station erj le Made In America.

A man, who is probably an unblushing liar, makes the following statement in n provincial newspaper: "Tho present Gov ernment is not very careful in carrying out the idea of buying British goods for publlo use, and It wants looking af tor. A friend of mine had a document from tho India Ofllco tho other day, and holding It up to the light to examlno the water markB, which struck him as somewhat out of tho common, ho found theso words: " ' Made In the United States of America,' " Now, It Is obvious that there can bo no ne cessity for buying writing papor In the United States for the use of the India Office." The India Ofllco mon say thoy know nothing about any American made papor. As a matter of sober faot, the British Government station ery Is usually so poor that It Is a gross insult to suggest that It was mado In America,

The recent capture off the Somali coast, near tho entranco to tbe Red Sea, of a small vossel loaded with arms and ammu nition, Is said 'o have led to a rather sharp in terchange of diplomatic notes between London, Paris, St. Petersburg, and Rome. Tho landing of arms in that part of tho world betokens friendliness neither to England nor Italy, and so the diplomats declared this neek. The immediate practical effect Is that the British and Italian squadrons In the Red Sea have forthwith been strengthened by roplaclng several rather old warships by quicker vessels and tho'.JtablUhment of a regular patrol.

A Domocratlo convention of tho Qroater Now York might havobcon hold in the big sitting room of the Lakewood Hotel this evening, as all tho con spicuous loaders were present. Tbo afternoon trains brought over a hundred Tammany men to the rendezvous In tho Pines, and to-night thero were nearly 300 Tummanyltes and other Democrats In and around tbo hotel. Thero woro enough womon present to embel lish tho picture. Tho victorious Democrats were In happy mood. Mr. Croker, who was chatting with Mr. Bernard J. York, the Brook lyn leader, and evidently talking over tho slate for that borough, surveyed the scons with an exprosslon ot satisfaction, while Mayor elect Van Wyck with John F. Carroll, walked about greeting old friends and mcottng souio new ones. Tho hotel orchestra gave a special concert in honor of tho occasion, and politics was prob,tbly novor botoro played under tnoro pleasant circumstances. Every stage, bus, carriage, and other vchiclo in Lakewood was ongaged to-day In transfer ring the Tammany men to and from tho depot nnd to tho various points of interost in nnd about Lakowood, Among tho arrivals wcro: Shorlff-eloct Dunn, Bernard J.

Scannoll, William E. Stllllngs, John S. Carr, William Dalton, Major P. J. Gleason of Long Island City, V. J. Bowling, B. 0. Hughes, and Timothy P. Sullivan. Mr. Crokor was at work all tho afternoon straightening out tho dlScrcnccs In tho various districts. This was no oasy task, especially in the light between Loader James -McCartnoy In tho annexed district and President-elect Louis F. Haffcn. Mr. McCartnoy, with his delegation, talked with Mr. Crokor after luncheon. When Mr. Haffen arrived Mr. Croker joined tbe two leaders In a prlvato room, and they spent considerable timo patching up their dif ferences. Tho matter was settled satisfactorily to both sides, presumably, as both men seemed contented, A delegation from Martin Engel's district came hero this morning to ask that Mr. Engel bo supplanted byBernnrd Rourke. They were dlsmlstcd with a statement tbut seomed to satisfy them. Later Mr. Croker listened to a delegation from tho Second Assembly District, headed by Leader Francis J. O Connor and ex-Congressman James J. Walsh. It Is understood that Mr. Croker settled the difference In tbat district also and the factions will bo united, with Patriots Dlvvor as leader. Ex-Congressman Walsh will, It is said, be appointed ns Assistant District Attor ney. Maurice B. Blumenthal and Daniel F. O'Reilly, son of the late Police Justice O'Reilly, are also named for places on Col. Gardiner s RtafT. It Is understood that tho work ot selecting the men to be appointed has not yet takon a def inite shapo. Tba claims aro being carefully con sidered and all the Tammany district leaders in J.ow York who are not comfortably settled A ready will bo placed In tbo best berths. As has already been announced by The Son CoL Waring Is sure to gn. This Is probably the most definite determination of the leaders hero. The presence of former Street Cleaning Commis sioner Coleman Is believed to have no Bignlfl canco whatever. He was nt the hoad of tbo department under Mayor Graotj's roglme, but nevor has been a Tammany man, so that he will not bo considered for the place. It Is certain that tho Street Cleaning Commlssionershlp will go to a Tam many district leader. The most conspicuous candidate is John J. Ryan, the leader in tho Thirty-second Aisembly district. He was deputy commissioner under W. S. Androsnnd nan do poscd by Col. Waring. Slnco tho time of his suspsnsion bo has ' een filling a $1,000 clerk ship In tho ofllce of John F. Carroll, Clerk of tho Court of Gcueral Sessions. Mr. Ryan has al ways been a loyal Tammany man, and many be lieve that ho is slatod tor the place. Another man who is belloved to be in line for promotion Is Deputy County Clerk P. J. Scully, leader in tho Tenth district. Ho has n record in thoCounty Clerk's ofllce which entitles him to recognition on bis merits, but despite this, the fuel that he continued steadfast in tho ranks of Tammany while his superior In ofllco deserted Is quito llkoly to helphfin. It Is believed that tho placo that Mr. Scully will bo namod ror Is that of City Clerk for tho term ot slxjears. wlthn salary of $7,500 a year. Ho has strong backing for tho place, and his ap pointment Is belloved to bo a certainty. Mayor Gleason is down here again for his health. All tho other visiting politicians say tho samo thing, a d they are probably tho healthiest looking lot of men who over came to Lakewood, Tho followlrg letter, showing how the name of Croker figures In the political history of Ire land, was received to-day by tho Tammany chloftaln from an admirer: "It was Roohuck, a pronounced and recog nized defamerof the Irish rnco, who said in tho House of Commons over fifty years ago that 'only the scum of Europe went to America," nnd often, when I read tbo ignorant abuso to which you and your true unit tried friends nre sub jected, I am constrained to believe that wo have with us in this country many bigots and so called aristocrats to whoso ancestry and lin eage Roebuck must have roforrod.

The Impending partition ot China, although not expressed In Quito such bold terms, It a subject which is absorbing the minds of most Europcnn statesmen. Tho ac counts aro somewhat conflicting with regard to tho concessions actually obtained by Germany, but thero Is no longer any doubt that they arc most Important and significant. Tho supineness of tho Chinese Government Is not yet explained. Itwasatflrstoxpectod that the Oriental authorities would show some of the Abdul Hamid sort ot cloverness and plot to got the rival powers to fight tho battlo for thorn against the Gorman aggressors. Thero Is' no sign of this as yet. Appearances nt tba mo ment suggest that each of the groat powers Is so engrossed with covetous plans of Its own that it Is unwilling to Interfere with the ad venturous Kalsor. It would surprise nobody In tho diplomatic world It tho gamo ot grab should soon becomo n scramble, of which China would bo tho hopeless vic tim. It may safely be assumed that Groat Britain Is not included In any general schema for the pnrtlliou of tho Chlneso Empire, It such a scheme oxlsts; but it Is also certain tbat Lord Salisbury will do his best to get a full share for England. It 1b tho danger of n falling out among tho plunderers upon whloh tho Emperor of China is, perhaps, relying for preservation, because such dangor Is very great unless Great Britain will satisfy herself with a meagre portion of tho spoils. It Is remarkable, on tho whole, that tho developments In tho past thrco weeks In tho far East havo caused so lltllo excitement in Europo. Tho only outward sign of the cxtremo tension ot tbo situation has been the almost dally Cabinet councils In London nnd tho great activity in tho high councils of other capitals. Bekmn, Dec. 11.

The iifranWucanf claims to glvo particulars of the documents on which Dreyfus, condemned to Ufa imprisonment for Bulling Fronch military socrcts to Germany, wai convicted. Tho paper says that owing to tho anti-Somite campaign Dreyfus decldod to resign his commission as Captain in tbo French Army nnd to offer his sorvlccs to Emporor William. Ho wroto to tho Emporor ask ing to be admitted Into tho German Army, and tho Emperor ropliod through the German Embassy at Paris, saying it would bo preferublo for Dreyfus to servo Germany In the post he then occupied. He would bo re garded as a German officer on a mission In France, and in tho ovent of war ho would tako In the Gorman Army rank similar to that for merly held by him In tho French Army. This proposition was accopted by Drc) ftiB. Tho Intransigtant adds that It learns that be fore Dreyfus was arrested eight letters woro stolen from tho German Embassy. Count von Munstcr, the German Ambassador, demanded of M. Dupuy, who was then Prime Minister, tho Immediate rcstorationof thelctters, threatening that If they woro not returned ho (tho Ambassa dor) would leave Franco in twenty-four hours. The letters were returned, but before they wore sent back tbey were photograDhed. It was these photographs that wero submitted to tho court-martial which condemned Dreyfus.

CUBAN TOBACCO RELEASED TilJT EM n A ROO RAISED ON THAT OWNED BY AMERICANS. Captain-General Wcjler's Order Prohibiting the Exportation or Tobaeeo from the Ialaud la Sllll la Force, but lis Application to Cltlsene or the L'nlted Stntea Will Conae. Washington, Doo. 11. Consul-Goneral Lee telegraphed tho Stato Department to-day from Havana that, under ordors from Madrid, ths Captatn-Genornl of Cuba had removod the em bargo against tho exportation from the Island ot 1,015 bales ot leaf tobacco owned by Gustavo Salmon & Bro. of Now York. Only one other American Arm, Bauridol & Co. ot Now Orloans, bas not had the restriction re movod from Its tobacco, but as the evi dence In this case Is similar to that which secured favorablo consideration ot tho Salmon claims, Its release will probably bo a matter of a short time. Tho tobacco of the Salmon and Bauridol Arms was seized on tho ground that it had been purchased after Weylor's decroo of May 10, 1800, forbidding tho exportation of loaf tobacco, had been Issued. TMs decree applied to tbe provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana. Both firms contended that thoy had mado tho Eurchaso In thoso provinces prior to tho order, ut It was only recently that they could produce corroboratlvo evidence Weylcr's prohibition Is still in force, but Its application to United Stntos citizens will coaso with tho reloaso of the Baurldcl tobacco. Tho purpose of tho order was to Injure pecuniarily thu Cuban cluar makers in tho United Sta'et, who were contributing $1 a week ench to tho ciiiiio for which their countrj men are lighting. Shortly aftor it was issued the Stato Deptrtment protested against tho detention In Cuba of tobacco owned by American citizens. It was contended by tno department that this deten tion was In violation of tho treaty of 171)3 between the United States and Spain, which guaranteed certain commercial rights to cithor country In the event of war Involving the other. Spain answered tho protest with apromlBO to consider evidence that tho persons whoso to bacco was ileti lncd wcro American citizens and had not purcha'od tho tobacco after tho do croo of embargo had gone Into effoct. Thlsovl denco was satisfactory In u number of cases, and tho tobacco was released. Tho amount Involved In nearly all of theso cnscBwas small. Tho Inrgcst was that of tho Salmons. Spuln has shown no disposition to revoke the embargo so that Spanish subjocts can send tholr tobacco out of the Island, but thu Stato Depart ment has been informed that this may bo done simultaneously with tbo imposition of a heavy exportdutyon all tobacco, which will bo quite as ofTcctlro In preventing it from being sent to tho United States. PETITION FOR TnE REPEAL OF THE DECREE. Cnlixto Lopez, a tobacco merchant of 177 Pearl street, returned yesterday from Havana, whcro he had gotio with a petition to Captain General Blanco asking tor tho revocation of the decreo forbidding the exportation of tho best tobacco from tho island of Cuba. The tlrni of Callxto Lopez & Co. does a largo Importation business, nnd is represented In Havana. The decree of Wcyler forbidding tbo exportation ot tobacco f om tho provinces of Havana and Plnar del Rio proved lo bo distinctly disadvantageous to tho tobacco Importers, and, after a long con sultation, a petition was prepared by Mr. Lopez. This was tnken to Captatn-Gcn-crnl Blanco, nnd ho consulted at once with thC'ConsoJo do Admlnlstrnclon," or Ad visory Bonrd. which body, although lltllo known. Is utmost invariably consulted in any matter of commercial Importance, Tho matter was put before this bonrd on Dec. -1, and, after soma consultation, it was voted to recommend tho revoking of 'Weylcr's edict Tho matter was thon submitted to tho home Go eminent, nnd tucntiwhllo Mr. lxpcz returned to New York. Ills llrst question on arrival was whether tho edict had boon revokod. and ho was very much surprised to learn that it had not been withdrawn, slnco ho hnd been practically as sured that tho revocation edict would bo mado In u very few days. A member of ono of tho largest tobacco tin- Sorting Arms in this city said last night to a UN rcportor: "Wo confidently expectod that the odlct would b- revoked very soon, nnd Mr. I.opcz was very much disappointed on his arrival to learn that It had not been rcokcd. At llrst, sou will retnciubor, not a single Spanish Importing firm mado any protest against the edict, but slnco that time the fooling against it has grown con siderably. Not for any political ronton nt all, but for purely commercial reasons, Mr. Lopez drew up his petition usklng that tho edict be revoked. Tho edict has hurt tho tobacco importers a great deal, mid It has failed, on thu other hand, lo accomplish what wns intended, namely, preventing tho cigannnkcrs lu this country from earning any money to send aid lo the insurgents. So far as wo tould find out, tho rignrmnkers at Tampa and in all Florida wcro not much bumpered by tho edict. When they could not get tho best Cuban tobacco, that from Havana or Plnar del ltlo, they got it from other places, and wages went on as bofore. "Tho importers of tobacco in this country aro naturally anxious to havo Woyler's odlct re voked, and so nro the exporters InCiihi, Tho greatost opposition to the revocation of thu edict unino from tho cigarmakcrs in Cuba, who havo counter-petitioned that tho edict bo not raised. Tbat Captain General Blanco has not al ready seen fit to rnlso the edict has surprised us, especially after tho prlvato advices which we had from Cuba In regard to tho petition submitted by Mr. Lopez. Wo nro confident, however, that tho revocation will be made within a very short time, Blnco wo have heard that tho opposition has been largely silenced by tho fact that real Spanish exporters wero supporting the potltlon of Mr. Ixipoz. That petition, although It wns submitted by the head of one firm nlonc, bad the sanction, I think, of nearly nil the Spanish tobacco importing Arms In this tountry, so completely has our feeling In regard to tbo edict been changed." til'AIN NO LONGER OBJECTS.
