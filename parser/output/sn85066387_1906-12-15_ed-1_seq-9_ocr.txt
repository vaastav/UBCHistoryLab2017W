I ff«s PAST IS A BUNK TO THIS MAN Mysterious Stranger at San Jose Cannot Tell Xame or Where Home Is WEEPS OVER PLIGHT SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE CALL SAX JOSE. Dec. 14.— There ie a strange case of lapsed memory at the county jail In this city. Several days aeo a well-dressed man wandered in, apparently in a dazed condition. He said he could remember nothing aa to his homo, and In fact, nothing at i\H connected with his past life. He had an impression, he said, that his name was Oliver Dlx, but whether this was correct he could not say. The man was given a room, but has not improved any. In fact, he seems to be 'growing worse. He cannot re call events of a few minutes. When facts which an ordinarily intelligent mar. should know, such as the name of the President, are called to his atten tion, he recognizes them as true ti but a moment later when asked regarding them he seems not to know them. The things about him- the mystery recognizes, and he talks intelligently when using abstract ideas. He under stands the meaning: of home, and.be lieves that somewhere in this ;land he has one, but where it. ls. he- has not' the slightest idea. So far as remembering any facts Is concerned his. mind is ; an absolute blank. He often breaks down and weeps from the lost feeling which oppresses him, and he has been unable to sleep for three nights. He seems always to be striving, without avail, to break through the wall of oblivion which shuts him off from his past. The man has been examined by a number of persons and his case Is a puzzling one. "Whether he is feigning this condition because he has a past which he wants to forget, or whether he is the victim of one of those strange freaks of the brain which have been a source of astonishment many times. Is not known. He has never given any indication that his condition is not ac tually what he claims it. to be. Jailer Cottle Is making arrangements to have an examination made by some nerve specialists. In the hope that the cause of the trouble may be located.

THE SAN • FRANCISCO GALi;fe I SATTOPAY;aDECEMBERv-15^.1905;K^ NEWS OF THE LABOR WORLD EDITED BY The Labor Council discussed for sev eral hours last night a reconsideration of the vote to unseat Alexander Dljeau as a delegate from, the Stablemen's Un ion. The routine business of the" coun cil was hurried through to reach this matter. The Stablemen's Union sent an other communication, insisting upon the seating of Dljeau. As he,. was. an expelled member of the Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, the organizing '• com mittee last week decided that Dljeau was ineligible to a seat The; council finally sustained the report of ; the or ganizing committee and Dljeau' was re fused a seat in the council. • The boycott against Sanborn & Vail, which Is of several years' standing/was raised at the suggestion of the Picture Frame Workers' Union. - The wage scale' of the. Theatrical Stage Employes' Union was Indorsed, subject to the indorsement of the international organization c , A safe was ordered purchased in which to store the" records of the coun cil. - , The delegates from the Water Works Employes' Union were seated, as the organization in no way interfered with the jurisdiction of the Steamfltters' Union. * The Joint committee on the lack of car service of the United Railroads ap peared before the Supervisors yester day. It was reported -that the company had signified its willingness to grant the reforms insisted upon by the coun cil as soon 'as practicable. The com pany stated to the committee ..that ten new cars a week would be 'added to the rolling stock of the corporation after January 1. The following resolutions condemn ing the position of the President on the Japanese question \u25a0were adopted: Whereas, the President of the United States. In his recent message to Congress, made many extreme and unwarranted .statements regarding the relations of the people of this country, ana especially the people of California, to the Japa nese, Bueb' statements belrift coupled with criti cism of the people of San rrancisco In particular that Is absolutely unjustifiable; therefore be it Resolved. That the San Francisco Labor Coun cil, In regular meeting assembled this 14th day of December. 1906. does hereby deplore and con demn the utterances of the chief executive of the nation regarding the attitude of onr people toward the Japanese. Resolved. That the statement of the President to the effect that the Japanese bad been shut out from the common- schools of San Francisco 1* not In accordance with the facts In the case, our Board of " Education having, in \u25a0 conformity with the laws of the State, merely ordered that Japanese who desire tr> attend our public schools be segregated from the white children, .this ac tion being prompted by the Insistent demand . of Caucasian -parents that their children of tender yearn be relieved of association with - adults iof an alien race (95 per cent of : the Japanese who attended our common schools previous to the en forcement of . the regulation of . the - Board of Education referred to being -: over 18 " years -of age); and" 1 - '\u25a0 ". \u25a0- v ,:-..\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- -";\u25a0\u25a0.'\u25a0. :\u25a0\u25a0-.•,. \u25a0;--.- ; Resolved, That the action- of our Board : of Education in this respect is highly . approved by our people, and based on a commendable regard for. sound public policy and a" keen desire to safe iruard the morals of our . children. <.->•.-,• :-..,-; Resolved, That the • contrast . the i President makes between the action of ourcommon school authorities in segregating ' Japanese; and -other .Asiatic pupils in, our common schools : from , Cau casian children . and . the : practice of colleges and nnlversltles In accepting Asiatic 'students on: the same conditions * as : thej^ do , Caucasians *is not warranted by the facts—in the one case ; the practice havtog - been for Asiatic adults to as sociate with V the Intimacy common <to I public school life with Caucasian children,' while In the other the - students are .of similar ages, : a \u25a0 fact that obviously removes the chief . reason for . the action of our school authorities in this matter. : - Resolved, That the action of the Board of Education of San Francisco with respect to Japa nese does not violate any : provision of existing treaties between the United Btatos and Japan; consequently \u25a0 the reference of the President to the use of the army and navy on behalf, of the Japanese residents of this . country is I unwar ranted in law cr by. the facts with respect to the attitude of our people toward the Japanese. Resolved. That the San -Francisco Labor Coun ell does especially deplore I the fact that the President of the Untied States should recom mend to the Congress the - enactment ; of laws providing itor the natarallzation of Japanese— a race of people absolutely non-assimilable with ours and having neither regard for our code of morals nor our Institutions. .Resolved. That with respect to the statement of President Roosevelt that "we hare as much to learn from the Japanese as they have to learn from us," we suggest that our people can well afford to . deny themselves Intimate knowledge of such cherished Japanese 'Institu tions as licensing and fostering of prostitution by the Government, and social conditions which recognize prostitution as a cardinal virtue when the profits of the prostitute ere devoted to relief of the financial embarrassment of her parents. Resolved. That the attention of the President, as well as Representatives in the Congress, and our cltlzrns generally. Is respectfully directed to the "Report of the Commissioner of Labor on Hawaii" (bulletin of the Bureau of Labor No. 66. September. 1906). which reveals In stratling manner the effects of unrestricted Japanese ' im migration to Hawaii, especially the results of! the Intermingling of white and Oriental pupils In the common schools. \u25a0 Resolved. That this council regards the state ment of the President to the effect that Japa nese are more efficient as workmen than whites as an absurdity, and deserving of no other at tention than to designate It as such. Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to the President cf the United Statps the members of the Cabinet/the Representatives and Senators of the Congress, the Governor of California, the Mayor of San Francisco, the Board of Education of San Francisco, and be given to the press for publlratlon. / J.

BOYLE George A. Tracy, president of Typo graphical Union No. 21.' :\ In - addition Tracy Is president of , the San Francisco Allied Printing Trades I ; Council. While he has not been many, years: in Calif fornia, he has demonstrated /during the short time he has been here, that he isa many-sided man: Gifted with a fine presence, h^has a way of stating his ideas upon" any in terse and forceful language.. In no, sense «an orator, he has the power of grasping his subject and presenting it in plain English.-co that no one Is in doubt as to his opinions when .he; finishes. Tracy can be said to have a national reputation. When • the war in . the Philippines broke out* he. was in the Government Prlnting'Offlce in Wash T ington. In looking around for a^ com petent " man to open a printing " plant in the new possessions, he was singled out and established a printing office for the Government and put it in run ning "order. On ; various other oc casions his worth has been recognized. The federation certainly would make no mistake iri placing him at its head during the coming year. While It is too early -to state all the : subjects to be considered at the meeting, three questions .which will call for wide discussion will be, the attitude President Roosevelt has as sumed upon the naturalization of ; Jap anese, government by injunction .and the Importation of convict-made goods from one State to another. This last question Is being discussed by the law and legislative committee of the Labor Council and a bill will be presented to the coming Legislature to prevent the bringing into California of any products of convicts. A bill has al ready passed ' the. lower .house;- of Con gress giving the States, the right to prohibit, prison-made goods passing from one State into another. Repre sentative Hunt of Missouri, a stone mason by trade, isthe author of the? bill. The House passed it almost unanimously and ' it Is expected the Senate will place no obstacle in .the way of its becoming a law. This law will make it easy, for the various States to keep , out these undesirable products. Missouri,/-; Representative Hunt's State, does 1 a big business in farming out its convicts to contractors. The price paid in Missouri is 6O.cents for each able-bodied ;convlct. T At- the present time there are feome 1500 pris oners working In the ; shops for the contractors.

There is no reason why you should take any steps to quiet title under the McEnerney Act. Your titles are good. The people of Chicago, after the great fire in that city, declined to avail themselves of a similar act, or of the Torrens law. Their titles were good then and are good today. 2. This- Company, by its own records, can prove your title to be good and can disprove any 'false title set up against you. 3. The clamor for the so-called "quieting of titles" under the McEnerney Act is unreasonable. Titles cannot be quieted under that act The judgment rendered under the act may, under the decision of the Supreme Court, be attacked at any time 'within a year by any person who has not been personally served with summons. The judgment may also be .attacked on the ground that proper diligence was not exercised in discovering adverse claimants. 

YOUR POLICY PROTECTS YOU AGAINST ALL OP ' THESE MATTERS. We are advised that the Federal Courts will declare the McEnerney Act void. 4. Many corporations organized since the fire in April have flooded the city with notices of the iniqui- ties which, may be worked under the McEnerney Act. In the same notice they invite you to avail your- "selves of .the act— at so much a lot to them. 5. Your policies are an absolute protection. This Company is watching every suit brought. You will be notified at; once if as much as a fraction of an inch of your land is claimed by any person under this act, and you will be protected without charge. The Company's plant and records, which have cost nearly one million of dollars, and its assets of $750,000 will stand between you and attack. 6.. Some of the largest property owners in San Francisco and the . representatives of some of great corporations are now taking out policies in this Company as sufficient protection to them of the titles to their real estate. 7. The public records will in due time be restored. This Company can and will reproduce them as soon as the people indicate their desire for them. '< y/.(: Calif ornia Title Insurance and Trust Company!
