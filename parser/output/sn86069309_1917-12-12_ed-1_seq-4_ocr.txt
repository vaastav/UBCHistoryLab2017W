The President in hi momentous message to Congress, Tuesday, December 4, acted as spokesman for the American people, hence every possible means of communication were used in order to herald his words to all the nations in order that they might know the true meaning and purpose of America's part in the great conflict. This message, if not already should be read in every American homo. Few President's messages have ever surpassed it in the matter of eloquence. Our President is endowed with an enviable intellect, ho is so thoroughly broad minded, practical and has the highest ideals for the people of whom ho is the chief executive. One of the striking points in his message, aside from the pro posal of declaring a state of war on Austro Hunzary, was when the President spoke of the attitude of the American people toward Ger many. He stated that America was not in the war for revenge. It was not her purpose to stoop to the lowest depths and inflict Ger many in the same manner which she has inflicted America and her allies. Hut instead, we believe America has been moved by righteous indignation and she intends to right all wrongs which the common enemy has imposed on other nations then we desire peace without annexation and as the President said at the conclusion of his message, "The cause being just and holy, the settlement must bo of like motive and quality. For this we can tiiht, but for nothing less noble or leis worthy of our traditions. For this cause we entered the war and for this cause we battle until the last gun is fired." Recently wo were invited to attend a gathering of young people in our town and during the cours i of the evening they were asked to sing the Star Spangled Banner we were glad there were not many outsiders present for the response was pitiful. The idea seems to prevail that the National hymn is difficult consequently America is substituted on most all occasions. We admit the Star Spangled Ban ner is not quite as "catchy" as America nevertheless it should be sung oftencr and we are at a loss to know why the children in our public school are not being taught to sing the National hymn. 

FARM AND STOCK. Last week was the banner tobacco wetk in thib county. The weed was in fine order for handling and the growers took advantage of it. All rectiving points in the county were busy and the farmers carried home more money than they have for many years. o o o The crop for ntxt year will be the Urgent ever. Dealers are already con trading for Burley at t?0 from the ground up. o o o Jess Bunger's sale, near Ouston last week, sheep sold from W to tw SO per haad; si mts brought 1310; stripper cows 67 to '; mules to horses $80 to $i3o; straw $12 50, and hiy $i8 per ton; cultivators $20 to $33. The sale was around $4,000. D. W. Henry was the auctioneer. o o o Owen and Gilbert Kasay, of Irving- ton, route 1, sold 4. 000 pounds of Burley at $45 round. H. W. Gross 4.000 at $27. A. F. Sipes sold 11,000 hills for $881. R. C. Brown 2,700 pounds at $80, half acre of this crop yielded 1,001 pounds and brought him over $200. 000 Clarence Dooley, of Big Spring, de livered one load of tobacco that brought him $596. 000 John Cook, who started buying to bacco in tne patch and at prices that everybody thought extravagant and hazardous, is still hungry for the weed. Siturdav he capped the climax by pay ing $35 from the ground up for Park Wiight's crop of 11,000 pounds of Burley. John is a good buyer but a bad seller according to his way of fig uring. Says he lost just $i5,o00 by selling his purchase too early. He is still about that much to the good and is not kicking. 000 J. S. Stith, brother of the Hon W. A. Stith, sold his farm of 222 acres in Meade county to E, K. Hardaway for $3 800 Mr. Stith has bought a farm of 000 K. L. Carman sold 7,000 pounds of Rnrlev m 26 SO. S. C.

Since America entered the war 1548 officers had to be added and they $2, (Jul) a year. It is worthy to note that we have some folks in the b.ing $15 50 round world who are not working solely for the almighty dollar. 000 Compton Brothers at It is almost disgusting to hear of tho ''high brows" at the Na tion's Capitol, criticising the President's mes.-age and picking it to peices. We greatly wonder if they could do any better. How much more becoming it would be if they would look for the good in it and abide by that, to say nothing of what would seem their patriotic duty. The most ignorant persons are oftimes the severest critics, but it takes tho wisdom of Solomon to always be able to grasp the good in things. We notice that New York City is iu the lead in sending surgeons, physicians and Red Cross nurses for service with the American base hospitals in France. It might be expected that New York would be in the lead but some of our large cities have furnished only a very few physicians and surgeons, according to the large number they have who could go our own metropolis of Kentucky has fallen short in this line of service. One writer has suggested that while we are remembering the soldier boys who are in training andjthose in service, why not re member the Bed Cross nurses i And we heartily agree with him., The-e girls have left all that is near and dear to them and some are even facing as much danger as the hoys in the trenches. They are serving us equally as much as the boys, so let's remember them with a ChrUtam box. We have already received subscriptions to the Breckenridge News which will be sent as Christmas presents. We want to remind Bewleyville, are remoddling their store house by putting iu an up to-date glass front, enlarging, painting and papering the inside. This is made necessary by their large and increasing business. 000 The hog shortage on Farms Septem ber 1, according to reports by United States Department of Agriculture was 5 427.OOO and the corn increase was 607,842,oOO as compared with the lOitt crop. It is now up to the hog raisers to fill up this gap by raising more hogs. The Department urges that sows be bred in increased numbers to insure the needed number ot pigs next spring to eat the surplus of the IH17 crop. 000 The Food Administration has fixed a minimum price ot I5.5U a hundred pounds for the average, so that tne far mer can count on getting for each il'O pounds of hogs ready for market thir teen times the .werage cost per bushel of corn fed into the hogs. 000 An International Champion steer, Merry Monarch, owned by Purdue University, grand champion steer of the National Livestock Show this year. was sold for $2 (15 a pound to the Amer tucky are January SOihto February 1st. About two thousand Kentucky farmers and live stock breeder are expected to attend the conventions held (luring Farmers' Week at the College of Agri culture at Lexington, Ky. A number of prominent men will give talks, among them being Dr. G. C. Greelman, of Ontario, who will speak on Canada's part in the war, touching upon farm labor and farm production problems. 000 The cold weather, snow and delayed trains has cut this column of its usual farm news. We wish farmers would send us items for this column. It will help to make it useful and entertaining. People like to hear from the farmer and his doings. No class of citizen are more ir. the limelight just now. J . D. H, 

MULE MISSED HER TOBACCO Temperamental Mountain Canary Not Blamed for Planting Hoofs In Back of Her Only Friend. Thinking the animal made n mistake In not knowing whom she was kicking or It wus his fault becnuse lie forgot to give her the usual chew of tobacco, Fred Wales of Grass Valley, Cul., who carried his arm in a sling for some time as the result of a kick from Bes sie, excuses his partner of fourteen yenrs for injuring him. The mule Is known to every em ployee of the mine, 450 In all, and while there Is no affection for her among 449 of them, they all have a wholesome respect for her In spite of her contrary disposition. It Is n mine classic that she kicks the alrplpe two feet above ber for exercise. With Fred Walea, however, It Is dif ferent. He baa worked with Bessie for fourteen years and has become at tached to the animal. He excuses her vagaries as an Indulgent mother con dones the actions of a spoiled child. It is merely a matter of tempera ment, ho snys, and the other men do not understand her. His faith was shaken temporarily, but not for long. In the physician's office he took of fense ut a .suggestion that the mule should be killed on account of her VtdMHMM nnd rushed to her defense. "It wns perhaps my fault ; it certain ly was not hers. Bessie either did not know who it was when she kicked or I hud forgotten to give her tho usual chew of tobacco. I am willing to tuke ull the, blame." PULLED THEIR COLLARS OFF If Paris Women Wore Too Large a Neck Piece Other Women Forcibly Removed Them. In Paris, at one time, the people dropped their extruvngance, nnd "If a woman ventured to wear too large a collar, the other women would pull It off." Henry VIII as he did with 'verythlng he set his mind to Inter fered with the dress of his subjects to some purpose and brought forward un act against wearing costly uppurel. A few years later the law becume more stringent still. Philip und Mury compelled uttcntion not only by fines, but went so fur as to send offenders to prison. Elizabeth saw that the peo ple were reckless with their money, :iud caused un act to be passed which dcclured thut anyone who sold foreign apparel to persons having less thun U,000 u your in lund or fees, except for ready money, should forfeit every penny of the price. Ladies wore hoods, hats und caps of every concolvuble shape They were careful as to their hair, und they hud a lino assortment of wigs ut hand. Eliz abeth herself sometimes wore red hair, and then reverted to black for a change.

Shop late if you ha vn't shopped early 1 Evidently our Mayor has not seen tit to use snow shovels ou the sidewalks or the roads. It is cruelty to animals to make tho horses plow through the deep snow with their heavy loads. Ambassador Gerald says the sum and substance of the President's message is "Beat Germany lirst and talk afterward." Beginning Monday, December 10, all bakers broad from now on will be made under Government license. We can sympathise with the Louisvillians on the sfaajrtuge of gas Thursday. The association donated the animal, which wtighed I,6i0 pounds to the American Ked Cross, which re sold it to Armour & Company tor $3,381, or $2. 10 a pound, a record price. Last year the champion steer, Califor nia Favorite, sold for $1.73 a pound. The grand champion carload of An gus cattle owned by E. T.
