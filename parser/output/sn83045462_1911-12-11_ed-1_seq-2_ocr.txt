During the ten years defamatorj letters were received by marri< 1 men and their wives, young brides and innocent girls. Letters Created Scandal. They treated a great scandal, and various persons were from time to time accused of sending them. Postal inspeetors were long on the ease, and finally last August they decided to arrest Miss De Witt. She was given hearing, at which the Rev. Mr. Snyder was one of the principal witnesses. Mis- De Witt was late in arriving at the court.

NERVOUS ON THE STANC Shows Effect of Grueling She Un derwent Friday. DID NOT EXPECT TO WEI Stokes Informed Her, She Admits That He Would Hot Undertake Second Marriage. NEW YORK, December 11? L>illiat Graham, who, with her chorus girl com panion. Ethel Conrail. Is on trial in th< supreme court for shooting W. E. D Stokes In the less last June, was pre pared today to face cross-examination The defendants came into court togethei and sat with their counsel before couri opened. Ethel Conrad probably will b< called to give her testimony after Miss Graham has left the stand. The condition of Mr. Stokes, who has been seriously ill as a result of complications following an attack of acute indigestion, was slightly improved this morning. "Miss Graham, be just as composed as you can under the circumstances." said Assistant District Attorney Butkner when the senior defendant returned to the stand for cross-examination. Miss Graham showed signs of the ordeal through which she passed Friday. She was pale, her features twitched and her hands went constantly to tier hair. To the prosecutor's question she replied in a clear voice, emphasizing by shakes of her head. Dodges Age Question. Mr. Buckner first attempted to make lite defendant admit that Instead of being twenty-three at the present time, she is twenty-seven or. twenty-eight years old. Miss Graham refused to become entangled L>n this point a-nd the examiner dropped it. "Fnder questioning Miss Graham admitted that she knew when she went to tin- Ansonia in December, 1908, that Stokes had been divorced hefe, but said -he did not know that under the laws of \'i'W York there is only one cause for livorce. She admitted, also, that she knew Stokes had no Intention of marrying again, as he had written to her that, having failed to make one Woman happy lie did not intend to try with another.' Miss Graham said, however, that their icquaintancc at that time was only friendship with no thought of marriage. Reverts to Adams Story. Then the prosecutor reverted to the t\l Adams story. East week Miss Graham iaid she was afraid of Stokes at the time she shot him, because her sister, Mrs. Andrews, had told her she had heard that Stokes had murdered the former "policy king." A coroner's jury found that Adams was a suicide. Miss Graham admitted that her sister had not told her tills story until some time after her acquaintance with Stokes began. "Did Mrs. Andrews raise any objection to your running around with this old iivorcee and murderer?" asked the prosecutor sarcastically. "No." "In fact, haven't you brought this matter up for the purpose of blackening Mr. Stokes' character?" To this Miss Graham's attorney objected. The witness declared that nobody had told her what kind of a man iStokes wa s. "Didn't you know of his relations with women?" "No." "Didn't you want to get on his pay roll?" "No. sir." The prosecutor's answer to these negatives wa> to read several of the girl's letters in which she invited Stokes to her apartment and expressed disappointment over his failure to acfept former invitations. Always Had Good Excuse. "Why didn't you stop writing and tele pnonmg to mm wncn no continued to disappoint' you in this way?" "Hecause," replied Miss Graham, "he ilways gave a very good excuse." I.ast w ook Miss Graham testified tliat Stokes never had made full return for H.700 whh-h she had given him to invest for her early In their acquaintance. Foday she said the money had hcen ?iven hep by her sister. Mrs. Singleton. Were these letters written before or ifter you gave him the money?" inquired i juror. "After," she answered. The prosecution disputed this and exiiiblted several letters in support of its -ontention.

The t aim of the new organization is to obtain > legislation by Congress at the present s session, making a specific appro; rlation for good roads?no matter how small i an amount?as an entering wedge, just as an appropriation of only $10,000 male . years ago to begin the rural free delivery of the postal service has become an annual appropriation of many millions. The organization will ask also that a new federal department he established with a member of the cabinet at its head, a department of highways, which will have under its direct supervision not only all the roads in the country, but also the railways, both electric and steam.

An address explaining in detail president of the Federated Fraternatles, taking up tlie good roads movement was made by 'Carl \V. Kimpton of Philadelphia, secretary-treasurer of the organization. Air. Kimpton declared that a great number of the members of tlie fraternities- lived in the country and would be directly benefited by the improvement of the roads. He declared that the Federated Fraternities represent no less than l.Vtno.nuo men, and that their wishes should have weight with the national legislature. "This is not to l>e a political organization in any sense of tlie term." said Mr. Kimpton. He said that while tlie government spends thousands of dollars every year on the railways which carry the mails, not a dollar of federal money is expended at present on tlie roadways of tlie country, although tlie rural free delivery system of the Post Office De-parturient uses the country roads constantly. National Aid Necessary. Gen. Martin Dodge of Maryland, former- I ly at the head of tlie division of public roads of the Department of Agriculture, in an address pointed to tlie necessity for national assistance in the construction of highways and also to tlie great advantages which would accrue from the construction of a splendid system of roads throughout tlie country. He referred to the vast sums of money which are being expended by tlie government in improving the inland waterways of tlie country, declaring that he believed it would be of even greater benefit to the people of tlie country to Improve tlie roadways, and would aid tremendously to reduce tlie cost of living. The money which it takes to build one of theli great modern battleships for the navy would suffice to construct a magnificent highway from tlie Atlantic to tlie Pacific ocean, he said.

GRAVES NOW ON THE LAND Ownership of Strip Asserted by Oak Hill Cemetery. IT HAS LONG HAD POSSESSION f War Department May Refuse Jurisdiction?Referred to Corporation Counsel. Uncertainty as to the validity of the title of the United States to Montrose Park, in Georgetown, which was acquired last year at a cost of $110,000, may result in the War Department refusing to accept jurisdiction over the park. The question has arisen over what constitutes the boundary line between Montrose Park and Oak Hill cemetery. Officials of the government claim that a part of the cemetery encroaches on the park. The complexity of the situation is increased by reason of the fact that if the cemetery company should surrender the ground in dispute it would necessitate removing a large number of graves. In directing the District Commissioners' attention to the matter, the War Department representatives assert that they have tried to adjust the situation with the company, but without success. It is clearly up to the Commissioners, they say. to straighten out the tangle. Referred to Corporation Counsel. Indorsements on the papers presented show that there is a difference of opinion in tlie matter as between local officials. Surveyor Ilazen holding that the disputed ground belongs to the company, while Capt. Mark Brooke, assistant engineer commissioner, suggests that it might he possible to recover the ground through legal proceedings. On ^commendation of ('apt. Brooke, the matter has been referred to Corporation Counsel Thomas for an opinion. l lie strip of land under dispute Is eighteen' feet in width at its widest point. It lies between the cemetery fence and what was believed to be the eastern boundary of the park at the time the purchase was made. In this area are graves made as long ago as Cemetery Long- in Possession. According to an opinion submitted by Surveyor Ilazen. the District acquired by purchase whatever interest the vendor had ip Montrose Park, and a record title was given to the District. It subsequently developed, however, that there was an encroachment by the cemetery, but, as the company had been in open, notorious and uninterrupted possession prior to the acquisition by the District and since 184'J, it Is Mr. llazen's belief I that tue District cannot claim this strip, acquired by adverse possession for more than fifty years, as the vendor could transfer to the District only what he had title to by possession. In recommending the reference of the matter to the corporation counsel, Capt. Brooke suggests the advisability of attempting to recover from the vendor under the warranty, in the event it should be found that Ihe vendor did not pass title to the strip. Shortly after the purchase of the park the War Department took control over it. the land being placed in fharge of the office of public buildings and grounds. Doubtful About Title's Validity. Tiie Commissioners have received u communication from the War Department Ktalintr that in view of siihse rjucnt developments, it is believed that the department should not assume jurisdiction and control over the park until assured that tile title of the United States to the whole of it is clear. It is suggested that if found to l>e valid either the claim should be extinguished or the strip of land in dispute should be eliminated from the plat of survey. According to II. S. Matthews, president of the. oak Hill Cemetery Company, to set back the fence would result in the encroachment on a number of burial lots and necessitate the removal of the bodies. The company has no right to take this action, it is declared, and. even though it had such authority, it is claimed, there is no available space in the cemetery for the reinterment of the bodies.

ITCS* j dent of the conclusions of tlu* tar ff joard on the wool schedule of the Payne\ldrich law. and a long conference with ! he hoard, democrats and repuhlicans. as :o data and details not included in the summary, although to he presented in t p Inal report, which is not expected to ; je ready for the President and Congress for eight or ton days. There are live arge volumes of data hearing on the wo >1 schedules that will go to Congress along with the conclusions. The board Is not ready to report in full upon the cotton schedule, and is not prepared to say when this report will he in shape for presentation to the White House and Congress, it will probably be another month before this information !s complete. The conclusions upon wool will form the basis of President Taft's first big message on the tariff. Front these conclusions he will reach his deductions as to whether the present wool rates of the Payne-Aldrlch law should or should not he reduced. The President lias not yet de ckhhi \v nether lie will recommend to Congress specific duties or make ids reenmmendations general. That is a matter lie will thrash over in his mind in the next few days. In fact, the whole suh|eet of the message will occupy his attention from now on. The regular session of the cabinet will lie hold tomorrow and may discuss the matter. Duties Not Recommended. The tariff board, as heretofore indicated would he the case, lias made no recommendations as to duties. It ha.oonflned its work to the presentation of fold figures. The President and Congress will have to be judges as to what these tigures authorize in the way of fixing duties. There will. undoubtedly. be aroused one of the greatest tarifT tights Congress lias ever known, as the conclusions will he construed by individuals ar 1 organizations according to their views as to protection and their political faiths. The conclusions of the board will deal ivith every one of the paragraphs of the wool schedule. As an example, the hoard takes up the cost to the American farmer of producing a pound of raw wool. This cost has been ascertained in every state and territory of the I'nion, and varies considerably in different parts of the country. The board, however, will show the average cost throughout the country. As opposed to this will be presented the cost of a pound of raw wool in all the other wool countries of the world. The comparative figures speak for themselves, so that President Taft. Congress ami the country may know the exact difference in cost of producing a pound of raw wool here and elsewhere. The interpretation of the fiearing of this upon the tariff question remains to he made. The same process will he followed by lie board as to every paragraph of the wool schedule, making comparisons as to ost hero and in foreign countries. President to Fight for Arbitration. President Taft is beginning a rigorous personal campaign to obtain the ratifloaion by the Senate of Ills arbitration treates with Great Britain and France, lie will alk with all the senators understood to jppose the- ratification of the treaties in :heir present form. Today lie talked with Senator Gronna of North Dakota. Mr. Sronna is a leader of the insurgent forces n the northwest and is supporting the candidacy of Pa Follette for the republean nomination. He is. however, in favor of international arbitration. At iresent he is disposed to agree with the oreign relations committee ?>i me p>onite tliat the treaties sliould be amended. If! toid the President today if lie could lo so ho would support the treaties as idvocated by Mr. Taft, without change. Conceded to La Follette. North Dakota is the lirst state in the "nion to hold a presidential primary eleoion next year. This election, the first of lie kind the state has ever had. will be leld March 17. The Taft people have iractieally conceded the state to I .a Folette and will really make no light there, nsurgcncy is claimed to l?e stronger in <orth Dakota titan in I>a Follete's own nate of Wisconsin. The voters will re ord their prefercttee by name. Republicans and democrats will vote on the same lay and at tiie same precincts as in a ten era I election. T.a Follette will open lie tight for lite presidential nomination vitli first blood, but North Dakota is the mly state that will bo conceded to let 'oiletc. A fight will he made in Da Kulette's own state by the Taft people, and hey believe they have a good chance of lividing the delegation.
