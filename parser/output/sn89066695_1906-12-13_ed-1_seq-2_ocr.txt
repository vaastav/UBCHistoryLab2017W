The opinion was by Justice Harlan. Tbe effect of the decision will be to continue to hold the men in confla meat for trial in Idaho. Of the men Involved. Charles' IL Moyer Is president, W. D.

The cases came to this court on an appeal from a decision of the Idaho federal court, refusing to grant writs of habeas cor rum. The principal point of controversy was the method by which the Idaho nathorttles obtained Jurisdiction over the men. All of them are residenta of Colorado and It was alleged on behalf of Moyer and his as sociates that they, were kidnaped in pursuance of a conspiracy to which the governor of Colorado and the Ida ho authorities were parties, and hence that Jurisdiction was ' acquired by fraud. .

Mr. Bryan complains that what th president says on th aubject of gov ernment by Injunction will not b Satisfactory to th laboring men, or to those who respect the right of trial by Jury. Th president's stand oa child labor Is commended, as Is also the position . he take on the eight-hoar day law and the right of the people to criticise a Judge. "H pay a deserved tribute to the prog- rej of the Japanese nation," aays Mr. Bryan. There will be general disappointment at the war-tike tone of his message where he discusses the army and the navy. He speak of the navy a the' surest guarantor of peace which' this country poesense. Shame upon the chief executive that he should place an instrument of brute force above th nation's sense of Justice as a guarantor of peace."

As U i aw U peopl who want tariff reform save no vole in congress, for those Repub lics member who believe that tarli! reform I accessary ar so tied up by the rigid mica of the bouse of representative and the autocratic power of a stasdpat speaker that they have so opportunity of recording their tariff revision attitude. . In the campaign of 1J08 the tariS will b an Important, If not th para mount Issue; and th voters will hav a more direct opportunity of deciding whether they ar enntent to continue to "pay high trust price, so that they ar expending nearly SO per cent more on th cost of their living than when th present tariff act waa, passed Is i87. .-. ... ; ; . .,, ,;; .,; Th tariff controveray with Germany and Canada and other eouatriea who ar dtermlaed to retaliate against. our extreme protection, will come tc a head aext year and will opea the eye of many voters who hav kept them abut through partlaaa prefer ace. Th aundpatter 'have de clared that th only revision they wlU stand for Is to revise the tariS rates higher, with a provision that th present rate shall be th mini mum for thoa countries that will allow our products to enter at their minimum rate or otherwise new max imum rates wUl b imposed. Such aa amendment to our tariff law -would be deemed by Oermany and Canada as a slap In the face and add fuel to th flame of disagreement, and pro vok a tariff war that would be dis astroua to th trad between th United State and those ;-.. It la a very seriou question and cannot be dodged a the domestic tariff Issue baa been dodged by th Republican leader by forcing othe: Issue to th front Th German gov ernment feel that It waa hoodwinked Into granting a stay of proceeding last year and by agreeing not to en force their new tariff until Jun 30, next for which, th United States made no return bnt tbe promise ol reforming th way In which the dctallr of executing the law on Import li carried out ; Our etafldpat wrgre refused to carry out tbe promises made by President Roosevelt through .the state department and the German government naturally feels aggrieved and will enforce- their maximum and prohibitive tariff against American products unless concessions are mad The stand pat statesmen will now have to take the responsibility of see ing the exports of our product to Germany, Canada and other countries materially reduced, or be willing to take from our protected monopolists a part of the protection they enjoy under the Dingley tariff. The ques tion Is up to them Whether they will fish or cut bait and there is not much time in which to decide which horn of the dilemma they will take.. Now th Fisheries Trust - The fisheries trust Is the latest octopus to fasten Its tentacles on patient and long-suffering people, and of course it is protected by the tariff, he average rate of duty on fish being 17.88 vir cent To sweeten th bitter cup to (h Hps bt the consumers tbe combine declares that-the fishermen are to get steadier and better prices and the consumers are to gain froni those ''economies" in production and distribution which have flattered'our boper with every trust prospectus, but withered Into higher prices when the combination wa perfected. It will be so with the fish trust, and the poo. fisherman, will find no competitors t purchase, so hi share of th spoils of the sea will diminish. , ' , . : No wonder .
