i . ' J .1 . -j - - - THE MVELMINGTON MESSENGER, TTJESD. , DECEMBER 12, 1899. V V ) I SOME POINTS IN THE MESSAGE. In a rapid view of the message it was stated that certain points might be noticed from time to time. It was bo long and so full of points one survey could only grasp a pointhere and there. The more it is considered the more ob noxious to Just criticism it appears. The president i3 an artful dodger, and shows adroitness in both avoidance and advocacy of pet plans and theories. For Instance, he is known to have been the extrefnest of extreme high protec tion advocates, but he does not con sider the present awful, most radical of robber' tariffs or hint even at a re auction. It is true that some eight or ten months ago at Boston he made re marks that looked favorable to a lower tariff tax schedule, but he has evident y bobbed back to his old love and is wrapped now in burning affection. Then again the great high tariff ad vocate while saying much about trusts, and really in places writes as if they were ver,y bad things for the country, makes no practical suggestion as to a remedy. We said we suspected sincer ity on the part of republicans when th?y talked or wrote against trusts, th natural outgrowth of their darling p t, a high tariff tax that oppressed Borne 7,000,000 for the benefit of 2,000,000 Oi ;J,000,000 prosperous, even rich benefi cl iiies who so greatly flourish under tl ; bounties granted under a robber tii a, that is alike unrigheousness, uiijust and unconstituional. How can ai y honest, sensible, informed, obser vant man repose the slightest confi dence in a party that for thirty years hus been plundering the country, op pressing the poor, outraging justice and common sense and been faithless and graceless in a thousand political acts? They have laid their great greedy hands upon the pockets of the millions of toilers and bread-winners, and their legislation has been in the interest of the rich and the upbuilding of a stupendous autocracy and pluto cracy. Said Depew in 1896, "I can name ten men in a circuit of ten miles around New York City who can precipitate in one hour the greatest panic the world has ever known. They can stop every wheel of industry at once." The pos sibility of such a statement lies in the fact that his party has steadfastly leg islated to that end through three de cades of dishonest and oppressive gov ernment. We are not singular in such a view. It prevails widely among thinking, reading, observing people all over the land. The able Charleston News and Courier makes this just re flection upon one point raised by the president that of trusts and com bines: "The trusts anl combinations which have led to the restraint of trade, and confined the . benefits resulting from class and sectional legislation to spe cial industries and selected communi ties, are all .the legitimate outcome of republican policies, which Mr. McKin ley so well represents. We have no wish, however, 'to judge tthe president harshly his message speaks for i'tself and, while its glowing periods will doubtless appeal to the emotionally in clined, in our opinion the whole pur pose of the message will be condemned by the sober-minded, and those who have a care for the integrity of our re public." It is noticeable that McKinley is more guarded, more reticent in what he says of trusts than his vicious, leprous Man Friday was in the Ohio cam paign. Mark Hanna stood forth cham pioning trusts, and he was the light man to favor so detestable and flagiti ous a combine known familiarly as trusts. Mark was doing a proper work representative of his beastly, depraved character. McKinley really writes as if he was out of touch with his cor rupt henchman for he says that if "the present law can be extended more cer tainly to control or check these mono polies, or trusts, it should be done with out delay." But he offers no remedy. He is like an empiric in medicine who visits the patient, feels pulse and skin looks at the tongue and takes the tem perature, talks with Solomonic preci sion in general platitudes, and yet of fers no relief, prescribes no remedy. If the patient is suffering and some remedy known to the household as possibly efficacious under certain con ditions can be found, let it be-applied at once, and then comes "the good morning" farewell and out goes the pretender. Dr. McKinley thinks the great American people (the patient) are afflicted and sick perhaps, and yet he offers no restorative, but contents himself by referring the case to the American congress, that may be as full of quackery as himself and equally in competent. Dr. McKinley has no con fidence in the skill or sincerity of his brother political doctors in the con gress. As to Philippine matters, we had more to say on Wednesday than of other points. The president cannot evade hi3 re sponsibility in precipitating a war t against a very weak, impotent people, '' that he professes to believe belong to the great United States by purchase at the price of two dollars per head. He labors hard to create a plea in just ification of his usurpation of power as well as his brutalities enforced at the cannon's mouth. There is no doubt that the congress did not expect any such game to be played as he has play ed, or it would have been grossly re creant if it had not taken decided steps ,to prevent the presidential esca pade. His plea, specious and mislead ing, that the Filipinos were entirely favorable to the $2 a head sale is not according to facts. They were not al lowed and say in the matter. The News and Courier intelligently and cor rectly says of McKinley's plea of Justi fication that it cannot be true "in view of the fact that no means whatever had ever been employed by the United States goverrunent to ascertain the wishes of the people of those islands, the Intimate associations o fthe repre sentatives of the United States gov ernment having been almost entirely confined to the representatives of the Philippine people who were engaged in a war for independence against the government of Spain. The president's denial of Aguinaldo's claim that he was promised independence by any of ficer of the United States in return for his assistance is not warranted by facts, and does not agree with the statements which were made by the official representatives o the United States before this government had em- "barked upon the policy of blood and desolation in the Philippine Islands. All the excuses that can be made now will not'rub out the record of the Unit ed States in that country?' The responsibility of war rests upon the action of the president, and he de serves the censure of every true man and real patriot for his usurping con duct. We agree with our Charleston contemporary that it ia a question for investigation that the congress "ought to inquire why the president assumed the sole prerogative of that body in engaging in a war without its author ity. There has no been a time Once the first guns were fired at Manila, when the president could not have called the congress together and re ferred this whole question to that body for settlement. He cannot share his present responsibility with con gress, and he cannot escape the enor mity of the offence which he has com mitted." The little fellow must bear his own burden of censure and walk the burning marl alone and unshel tered.
