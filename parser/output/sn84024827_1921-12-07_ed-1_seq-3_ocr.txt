WASHINGTON. Dee. 6. President Harding's suggestion, made in his message today, for a court to decide wages and conditions of employment, was declared to be a "reversion to con ditions obtaining more than 400 years ago," in a statement issued tonight by Samuel Gomoers. president of the American Federation of Labor. "The president's message is in most respects an admirable document," the stptement said, "but he .like too manp men. fails in his understanding of the relations between workers and em ployers, of the aspirations which are in the hearts and minds of the great mass of our people. "Indeed, the president's proposaj for the establishment of a court with leral powers to decide as to wages and conditions of employment is noth ing- moro nor less , than a reversion back to the conditions obtaining more than 400 years ago when the court of quarter sessions determined the wages of the workers and prohibited them from asking for more, or em ployers from paying more than the court's decision and to condemn men to compulsory servitude and slavery if they resented in any way the de cisions of those courts." tha( either new proposals would be in his hands by Tuesday or the ne gotiations would be finished.

Michael Collins, who had planned to go to Dublin, changed his mind and remained here with Griffith anil bis other colleagues. Eamonn de Va lera, so far, has declined to comment. Lrbor Is Jubilant Arthur Henderson, labor leader, says that the whole British labor movejnent will welcome the settle ment with joy. Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birk enhead both addressed meetings at Birmingham tonight. Chamberlain asserted that the gov ernment had been true to the letter and spirit of its pledges. The settle ment provided all essential conditions of national and imperial security. Lord Birkenhead said he has risk ed everything on his belief in the pood faith of tho Irish delegates. This issue was the most vital on which a British cabinet fcad pronounced for 240 years. "We have made up our minds, ri.ihtly we believe," he announced. "We have put everything to the haz ard. When this ,'Fttlement is u cepted, there will meet at Downing street a'new partner of the empire; her spokesman, the Irish prime minis ter, will , meet . on equal terms with the prime minister of Great Britain."
