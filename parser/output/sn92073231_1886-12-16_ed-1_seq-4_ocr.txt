Our out-oj -State exchan ges are respectfully requested to assist us also in giving publicity to this paragraph. All of our tarheel readers abroad know of many who were formeraUy from North Carolina. Please send their names on a postal. We shall commence shortly send ing out statements to those of our subscribers who are in arrears for as much as a year. To do this entail upon us considerable trouble, time ( and expense. We earnestly ask our delinquent readers to help us avoid this by making a remittance at once. We hope every subscriber who ia not receipted for the present year vriU remit something, be it great or small. Ask yourself if you owe us anything, and it you do, get a postal note, money order or registered letter and forward it to our address. A failure to remit will force us to discontinue sending the paper to you. We must clear our lists of all habitual delinquents. Are you one? As the' time trouble and expense required to send out statements to de lLuquents is necessarily great, postal cards will be used this year, instead of envelopes and slips. " We are glad to say that many of. out subscribers are remitting and we hope to hear from many more before we commence send ing out statements. Mr. W. P.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The annual communication of the President to the Congress, which ap peared, in part, in last issue of The Sentinel and is concluded in this , is a comprehensive and exaustive state paper. It is quite generally com plimented by the press of the country for its ability, wisdom, thoroughness and decision. Its Democracy cannot be gainsaid "and as a strong party document, it will have good effect among the people, who take the time to read it carefully. The main body of the paper is founded upon the special inquiries and suggestions- of the heads of the various departments who compose Mr. Cleveland's cabinet, showsng his close supervision of the general funct ions of an economical and effecient government, and an entire harmony oi administrative politics. To those matters the discussion of which pertains partieulaly to the ex ecutive head of the -nation our 'for eign relations, the fisheries, boundary liues.commercial, extradition and copy right treaties, the tariff, the coinage, pensious, civil service and the govern ment of the District of Columbia Mr. Cleveland devotes a more personal and profound attention. His apparent leaning towards free trade is hailed with much deliirht bv the free trade wing of the Democracy. Almost as important as his tariff recommendations are the President's views on the relations of capital and labor. This model message of the Presi dent leaves the opposition press 'al most without an opportunity to suc cessfully criticise its political senti ments. Last summer it was intimated that President Cleveland had a foreign mission in store for Gen. Cox if he was defeated for renominations to Congress on account of his Civil Ser vice record. The friends of this gen tlemen are now discussing the appro priate fitness of the appointment by the President of Gen. Cox to the Turkish mission recently made va cant by the resignation of Hon. S. S. Cox. The Sentinel would like to this able North Carolinian appoint ment to this mission. Onder the head of "A Notable Southern Paper," the American Ad vertiser Reporter, ot New York, is good enough to give the following : The Weekly Sentinel, published at Winston, N. C, by the well known journalist, Edward A. Oldham, is a notable instance ot the prosperity that is being evidenced by the South ern newspapers. Its progress has been marked 'and rapid. From an obscure country weekly cf less than 400 circulation, it has become in less than three years, a handsome South ern weekly news and story paper of over 4,000 circulation. Mr. J. Chester Rockwell, one of The Sentinel's most valued con tributors, is about to enter the minis try, so we see it stated in the Chad born limes. Mr. Hockwell is a young gentleman of pronounced poet ical talent, whose verses have been ac cepted and paid for by some of the leading Northern literary periodicals Poems from his pen have appeared at frequent intervals in this paper. The Sentinel extends its best wishes to Mr. Rockwell in his new calling. MR. 

KICHMOND JrKARSON an nounces through the Asheville Ad vance that he will in the Legislature lead no attack upon the county gov ernment system. He favors a plan to allow Buncombe and other counties in the Western part of the State to elect their magistrates and commis sioners, but will never, he declares. give his voice or influence to again put the white people of the Eastern counties under negro influence. Coi William . L. TERosaET, ot Wilmington, and who had command of the Third North Carolina Infantry during th war, had a short articlo ia the December Century, concerning the part taken . by Ripley's Brigade at the Battle ot South Mountain. . He testifies to the faithful set vices of the North Carolina troops in that battle, and does it in a condensed ' and well written paperA Cmt A V ADYMTISDia.

Stranja-werld thtsl CSmriotU 'Ckromei. - The following from the Danville Register is to the point, and expresses The Sentinel's views to a dot. The editors are to blame. There are cheap newspaper.; and cheap law yers and doctors. People soon learn to estimate a service by what it costs. If newspapers would stop the abomi nable practice of promiscuous and gratuitous "puffing" and make peo ple pay a fair price for their advertis ing, they would command more re spect and make more money out of their investment. Newspapers do enough gratuitous work for the pub lic at large, without being called on to push individuals and their private business into prominence tor sweet charity's sake. As for the Register we are always ready to advance the interest of the community we repre sent and we never lose an opportunity to advertise Danville and the country round about, but when we advertise a man's individual business, we charge him for our services and we find all reasonable men, willing to pay us a reasonable fee. Henry George's new paper will be called The Standard, It will ap pear January 8th and the subscript ion price will be S2.50 per auuuiu. For $3.00 cash we will club The Stmdard with The Weekly Senti nel. In his prospectus, Mr. George says : "My purpose is to make a news paper that while keeping abreast of the times in all the main departments of human thousrht and interest and affording a field for the free discussion of social and political topics by the ablest writers, shall give earnest sup port to the great movemeut that is now beginning for the abolition of natural rights a paper so full and strong and fair as to meet the desires of our friends and command thj re spect of our opponents." Mr. R. W. Knight, of the Hocking . ham Rocket is winning a reputation as a writer of interesting short stories; besides accomplishing other literary work. A recent member of the Ar laiusaw Iraveller contained one of Mr. Knight's sketches entitled "The Old Mill at Flat Rock," the scene of which is laid in this State. It is entertaining and well written. Edward Pa YSON Hall, who has beca a frequent and valuable contrib utor to The Sentinel, will on Janu ary 3d next take charge of the Mt. Airy Male Academy. His acknowl- edged ability will be productive of great success, anc our best wishes are extended to Mr. Hall. Col. Creecy, editor of the Eliza beth City Economist is authority for the statement that "a live and active man in a stagnant town is first regard ed with surprise, then with derision, then with wonder, then jwith thought- fulness, then with consideration and then with admiration." A meeting of the Board of Agri culture has been called for January 18th to which farmers and all others interested in the materiel welfare of the State are invited. Senator Maxey, ot lexas says the Democrats should "cut loose from Randall." SENTINKh CLUB RATKS. In clubs of 5 subscribers, $1.40 each.

The term "better classes" inav. in the not distant future, claim a new social definition. The "better class" of the future will be those who succeed by other means than the mere accumulation of wealth. The honest, intelli gent workmen, seeking advancement in the social scale as a reward for duty performed, be longs already, not to the "better class" only, but to the best class and such a one will give heed rather than to the voice of reason and the dictate of conscience than to the empty sophistry of the demagogue.
