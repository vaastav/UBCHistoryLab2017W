It te a plea ol that might have been expressed in a single sentence and with mach better effect. To the great question of the tariff he devotes but little space and that with fear and trembling when he leaves the realm of free tobacco and free whisky, He is as silent as the tomb upon the wrongs which the present tariff inflicts upon the toiling masses of the East; the poverty, degradation and crime which it eatailqjthat a few may live in splendor and bask in the sunshine of luxury. While he recommends a revision of the tariff, he hedges the recommendation with every expression that a total disre gard of the welfare and rights of the masses can suggest and there leaves the theme with the seal of his own weakness and insincerity. The Pan-American congress receives his attention, but he seems to realize that the present tariff is an insurmount able barrier to an extension of commer cial relations and he therefore limits the topic to international comity. He is opposed to the free coinage of silver, bat offers no argument to prove oi VU to the and dent ing nism top cure ests I that his views are entitled to respect and I confidence.

GOLD BUG IN DISGUISE. tive and It is evident from the tone of the presi -1 dent's message in treating the subject of sire oi Ivor tha# DroniJoni TT__9____ I silver that President Harrison is com pletely under the domination of the gold bugs of Wall street. The professed an than VU » D " 041 dm «7*7V« me proieBseo an -1 i ticipations of the Republican press of Montana that the future of the white can8 metal was safe in his hands are scattered I °* to the four winds and are proved to be as I ntterly without foundation as the pre-1 tecbed tentions prophecies in which they boast-1 of fully indulged of a ruling favorable to| the lead interests of the country from I torce Secretary Windom. The half-hearted I to and apologetic tone in which the presi-1 dent disposes of this important interest J withou shows that this administration may be| tba4 safely depended upon to do noth- w °nld ing which shall in the slightest | L «t degree be construed into antago- and nism to the Juggernaut of Wall I be street. The gold mono-metallsts are on tbe top and will remain there all through President Harrison's term of office, se cure in uninterrupted control of the monetary destinies of the nation and in profound indifference to the vital inter ests of the West.

OPMMBWU in ad the of What Prospectors Are Doing In Developing New Districts Tributary to Butte. o> An Exhaustive Article On The Fire Clay Mines of Thompson Falls. From Wednesday Daily. Not only are there millions of tons of silver, gold and copper-bearing ore within the city limits of Butte, hot there are also millions of tons within a radius of from fifteen to fifty milee of this city, nearly a I of which ie brought to the emel tere here for reduction. Only a fe* years ago the quarts ledges of Butte were the center of attraction for prospectors, few of them caring to go out into tbe mountains to seek hidden wealth, because of the lack of facilities for getting the or# to a mark t. A great many of them prospected for gold only, not wanting to bother with copper or silver, and as a result good prospects laid dormant for years, until works for reducing ores were erected here. Then some mining for quart z was done at various pointe within fifty miles of Bntte and tbe ore hauled here by bull teams for treatment. After the first to fire was and tbe of The dere and bull teams for treatment. After the first railroad began to build its line towards the city, ÿurospectore commenced to scatter out in all directions to search for copper and silver as well as gold, knowing full well that only a short time would elapse before a good prospect would be worth money even though it were a few miles from butte. The result of thie promiscuous prospecting ie now patent to everybody in Montana, but more eepecially to those in this part of it. Mining districts are to be found in all directions from Butte—north, south, east and west, forming one vast halo of mineral with this city as its center. New discoveries are beiDg made every day, and tbe magnetic influence of Butte capital is the power which is bringing them into prominence. About seventeen miles northwest of Butte tbe Oro Fino district can be found with its scores of prospects, nearly all of which are beiDg developed by Butte capital and brains. Several large amounts of ore, and the district being tributary to Butte, most of its production will be of benefit to this city. The district, which will in a short time become what might properly be called a part of Butte, is that immediately east of the city, ia what is known as Park canyon and its surroundings.
