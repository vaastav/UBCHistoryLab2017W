In the third century the windows of royal houses throughout Europe were glazed. Windows of colored glass were placed In many French and Ital ian churches in 674, and the use of glass became general in private houses during the twelfth century. The panes, however, were only three or four inches square, and the material was so infe rior that, while a room was lighted, it was often a matter of some difficulty to discern ehjects on the outside through the glass. For a long time windows In England were a subject of taxation. Barns and Fame, It Is amusing to learn that Burns when just emerging from obscurity jocularly anticipated that his birthday would come to be noted among other remarkable events. In a letter to his early patron, Gavin Hamilton, in 1788 he says, "For my own affairs I am in a fair way of becoming as eminent as Thomas a Kempis or John Bunyan, and yon may henceforth expect to see my birthday Inscribed among the won derful events in the Poor Robin and Aberdeen Almanacks along with the Black Monday and the battle of Both well Bridge."

Before me 1 saw a door and a great number of people about it. As I drew nearer I could distinguish St. Peter by his keys with some other of the apostles. They were admitting the people as they came next to the door. As the first after xpy coming up ap proached for admittance St Peter asked his name and then his religion. "I am a Romas Catholic," replied the spirit. "Go in then," says St Peter, "and sit down in those seats on the right hand." The next was a Presbyterian. He was admitted, too, after the usual questions and ordered to sit down on the seat opposite the other. My turn came next, and as I ap proached St. Peter very civilly asked me my name. I said it was Kneller. I had no sooner said so than St. Luke, who was standing just by, turned to ward me and said, with a great deal of earnestness, "What, the famous Sir Godfrey Kneller of England?" "The very same, sir," says I, "at your serv ice." On this St. Luke embraced me and made a great many compliments on the art we both of us had followed In this world, and entered so far into the Bnbject that he seemed almost to have forgotten the business for which I came thither. At last however, he recollected himself and said: "I beg your pardon, Sir Godfrey. I was so much taken up with the pleasure of conversing with you. But, apropos, pray, sir, what religion may you be of?" "Why, truly, sir," says I, "I am of no, religion." "Oh, sir," says he.
