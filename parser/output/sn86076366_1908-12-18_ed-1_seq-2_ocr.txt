RENO'S FIGHT FOR NEVADA The attention of tlie business men ami people generally is railed to the letter of the Reno Commercial Club in this issue. The unit tors dealt wi!h in the communication interests every citizen of Nevada. The statu has lieen in the grip of tho railroad company ever since the railroad was built and will continue to Ite in its grip for years to come unless its ]>eoplo now assist in the effort lteno is making for the establishment of a terminal point within the state. Through its system of charging the Nevada people through freight to Sacra mento and local freight back to destina tion on all shipments from the east, we have been compelled to pay tribute to merchants of San Francisco. In short, the people of Nevada have been roljlied by the railroad company for the benefit of San Francisco merchants. This system, which is ab nit the same as tho methods of the highwayman, has retarded the development of the sta.e, increased tho cost of living and taken money from the pockets of every mail, woman and child in the state. In short, it has increased the roveues of the railroad company and built up San Farncisco at our expense. When tho population of the state dwindled away every year and our industries lagged, the grip of the rail road company tightened. It did nothing to revive our lagging industries and our jK'ople were helpless. But now another era has dawned. The state is increas ing in wealth and population ami its strength should now be exerted toward breaking the chains that have b.iund us hand and foot. Rono has l>egun the light to compel tho railroad company to deal justly with Nevada. Sho is not lighting for herself alone but for the state and she should have our moral and tinancial sup port. The business men of Elko and every cit zen of this section of the state should assist Keno in this tight. Let us do our part toward destroying the system that has retarded the growth and development of Nevada for so many years. If you want this enrso to continue forever, withhold your support from Reno. If you want it to end in the near future, give Reno your moral and financial support. THE PANAMA CANAL PURCHASE . Ex-United States Senator Millard of Nebraska, in an interview published in the Omaha World Herald, takes issue with President Roosevelt on the Panama canal deal. The interview is interest ing because of the light it throws upon a very shady transaction and for its direct contradiction of many of the statements made by the president in file letter in which he charged the editors ? of tho Iniliauopolis News and New York Sun with making false statements nlXHlt the purchase of the canal property from William Nelson Cromwell and bis associates. Following is the interview. Read it and see if you can tell who got the forty million dollars the United States paid Cromwell for the interest of the French company in tho Panama canal prop erty: "Ex-Senator J. II, Millard ofi)i:,uha. former chairman of the senate commit tee on Panama canal, says President Roosevelt is undoubtedly wrong in a number of his statements concerning the Panama canal deal, cs)ieciully in the particular that tho $Io,immu>oo was paiti to the French government, or that tho French government was concerned in any way with' the sale of the canal properly and franchise to the United States government. Senator Millard took a prominent part in the senate in* vest igat ion into fho mutter. Iieing chairman of the senate committee at that time. " 'Tho French government had noth ing to do with the sale of the canal property,' said Senator Millard. "Ah >ut the only man who hud anything to do with (hat. so far as our committee was able to find, was William Nelson Crom well. We were never able to find who ho represented, or rather the stockhold ers of the concern which lie represented. Every leading <|iiestions we asked which pointed towards the real man I ?. ? hind Cromwell, was met with a blank refusal to answer. Who they were wo were never able to find out, ul though throughout fho six weeks of that investigation that ipiesHon was asked time after time. " 'Senator Morgan, one of the biggest mid most broad minded men in the country at that time, looked upon Cromwell as a mail who would hesitate at nothing so long as the prison doors did not loom behind the action. Mor gan often said: 'Cromwell is a buc cancer.' " 'I know that the money was paid to J. P. Morgan & Co. instead of to the French government, as stated hv Mr. Roosevelt. The records of our investi gation will show that wo secured that much information. And I have reas tns to lielievo that that money was sent to France. Rut whether all or any of it found its way back to stockholders in this countrv 1 cannot say. Ic might all have come back, for all I know, or again, it might have been paid to bona tide holders of the French claims. Rut none of it was paid to the French govern ment, so far as 1 know, and the French government did not have :h.? distribu tion of it. " 'I am certain there was no grafting on the part of any government official in this country so far as the payment of the $10,000 000 was concerned. This money was undoubtedly paid over and none of it ever stuck to fingers which handled it ltefore it passed into the possession <>f the American Panama Canal company, hut of course I cannot say where it went afterward. I have always, however, had suspicions along certain lines, but I cannot say what those suspicions were nor Whom they concerned.' " 'Was D.mglas Robinson or any of the Taft family members of the syndi cate?' was asked Senator Millard. ?' 'I don't know. They might have been. They might not have been. We never could get Cromwell to answer a question as to who the members of that syndicate were. I have no reason to think they were any more than I have i that any other man was a member. < " 'Cromwell knows. <}et hold of him ? and make him answer, and you will i know all about the Panama canal deal.' "Dili you ever talk to Roosevelt about < the matter; did he know the result of ] the investigations of the senate com mittee ?' " 'He undoubtedly know, at the time, all about the results of the inquiry. He seems to have forgotten a number of them now. however.' " THE 

SILVER MARKET According to the following summary , of the silver situation by tin? Boston ( Financial News, there does not seem to be any immediate prosjiect of improve- , taent in the silver market: ( "The pronounced weakness in silver, dealers in the commodity say. is due i ( chiefly to the continued selling by I India and China. In addition to the I ( selling from those sourccstlie production I of the white metal shows no falling olf. According to a member of one of the J largest silver bullion firms in this city I the most encouraging feature is the low price prevailing for the metal, which may induce some speculative purchases. I Aside from this, however, it is said that I there is nothing in the situation at the J present time to warrant the expectation of any decided improvement in the near future. "Aliout the only steady demand for I silver bullion comes from the Mexican government, which is buying about I 150,000 ozs. a week, and from the I United States government, which is I taking about 125,000 ozs. The demand I from the arts, while somewhat lietter I during the past six months than in the I first half of the year, is still quite below I what it has b-en in former years. It is I estimated that the arts have consumed only about :>,ooo,oon ozs. within the last three months. ".So far as India is concerned. Eu- I rojiean advices to a large bullion house here are that the Indian government is not likely to buy any silver for the entire year of I II0D, as the Indian gov ernment holds about riO, 000,000 o/.s. of I uncoined silver at the present time. I The Indian bazars, however, may buy some for speculation; but. apart from this, very little inquiry for silver from India is looked for. "About six months ago a bill passed j the Herman Reichstag authorizing the government to purchase 10.0000,000 ozs. i of silver for coinage purposes. This 1 amount was to have been purchased i within a year from the passing of tho I bill, but so far the Merman government has not Imught one oz. of silver. There are still 55.000.0i M oun vs to hn btught itj iln- Insular Department of the Federal government for Philippine 'coinage, and while there are no indica tions of any of these large ainouts of silver iM-iiig ordered in the near future, slill it is said that the governments abive referred to may come into the market at any time." 

ROOSEVELT'S FOOLISH MESSAGE President Roosevelt's latest message Is the most foolish docoument that ever emanated from the White House. No other president has felt it bis duty to ask congress to bring suit iigaiiist a newspaper for any cause. Other presi dents have been criticised by the press, but they did not descend to the love? of the lish woman and hurl billingsgate at the heads of tie* men who criticised them and their policies. Presidents Johnson and (Irani were accused or tarrying too long over their cups, but they did not consider it their duty to flniid special messages to congress ask ing it to bring lilwd suits against the newspa|M>r that published the report. Uarfield was accused of corruption lii( the Washington paving contracts, but he did not send special messages to con gress nbout it after he liecatne presi dent President McKinley's secretary of war was unmercifully erltieis m| dur ing the Cuban war for feeding the soldiers on embalmed lieof, but MeKin lev did not think it necessary to bring I lilxd suits against the press. Oilier instances of like character could lie mentioned in which presidents i of the United States and their aduiinis t rat ions have lwcn severely criticised, hut they meekly hi ire it as liecomes the dignity uf the high oflice they hold. But not so with Theodore Roosevelt. He throws dignity to the winds and de wends to the level of the gutter snijie to defend his position. And why? Bec;tuse the New V. >r'< World replied to one of his hitter personal attacks in defense of the Panama Canal deal?a transaction that the World believes was steeped in corruption from its inception to its close. Because the World had the audacity to reply to this attack, our greatly Indoved and honored president, the immaculate Theodore Roosevelt, wants congress to lock Its editor in a hastile. Great Scott* what are we coin ing to when the president of the United States makes such an ass of liimsslf : The Ogdeti Journal regardless of the risk it runs has the following regarding the latest freak of our freak presi dent. Theodore Roosevelt, president of the Unitetl States of America, slayer of wild beasts, official keeper of the national list of liars, falisHers. undesir ables and other things; ruler of the United States and magazine writer, has again broken into print this fteri. on with another of his daily spccial messages to congress Teddy tears the air and recommends almost every known punishment ex cept hurtling at tin; stake of Joseph Pulitzer, editor of the New York World, and for Delavan Smith, editor i ?f the Indiana)) ilis News. Simply hp cause these men have seen tit to give * I nice in their newspapers to stories regarding the Panama canal scandal which reflected upon some of Teddy's ( Constituents, the nation's executive head recommends dire punishment in many varieties. lie believes that the time has come when the government should sue these newspapers and if necessary cause them to cease publication In other words, Teddy, the terrible, would have a press censorship on everything for the public print except that which he himself, or ^ which his capable press agent, writes. He who utters aught against President Theodore Roosevelt or against his Friends, commits lese niajeste and should be punished. Hold your peace, therefore, until after the inaugural ceremony next March, because you ' cannot afford to he the subject of one i ?f those frequent speciaj messages. THE 

UPLIFT OF THE FARMER; SOME GOOD SUGGESTION Under the caption. "The Uplift for the Farmer," the Denver News very logically remarks: "If the republican party is really as anxious to improve the conditions of farming life as Mr. Roosevelt . would have the farmers believe, we can sug gest a few ways to help th" good work along. "They can repeal the duties which the farmer is now required to pay on practically everything he buys. "He pays a tariff tax of $?.! per thou sand feet on the lumber with which he must build his house or barn. "lie must pay a tariff tax of from ftt) to ?>o per cent on the clothing lie wears. "He must pay a tax varying in de gree but never falling short of :!0 per cent on the machinery with which he plants and reaps his crop. "He must pay a tax of s?."i per ton on the steel rails over which his crops are hauled to market. The railroad pays this first, of course. But the railroad comes back with extras from the farmer. "The farmer pays these taxes, pays them not to the upkeep of the govern ment. but to the upkeep of the privi leged 'interests.' And he sells practic ally everything he raises in a free trade market. If the republican majority wishes to improve farming conditions, let that majority lift these unjust burdens from the farmer's hack. Let it put through the work of river im provement. a tiling of which it has talked unceasingly for thirty years, and in which it has done aim >st nothing at all. Let it w'ipe out the illegal trust combinations that are holding up the farmer at the few points on which t ho tariff neglected to rob him. "I)o these things, and the farmer will attend to his own uplift, thank you He is doing pretty well already, in spite of his hugely unfair handicap. He has brains and energy enough to take care of himself if he gets half a chance. And until lie has that half chance, we think the efforts of presi dential commissions not merely useless, but a trifle impertiment as well." REFORM THE HOYS The < 'arson News says that at the present tini" there tire 'ill) prisoners at the stji*!< prison. < >f fills miinlier four are women. |!! l<oys less than "M years of ago and ?"> I less than years of age*. The confinement of these I toys and young men in the prison with the hardened criminals is simply educating them for criminal careers. The stale has no right !o expect that these young men will reform and become good citizens when their terms expire. In stead of their imprisonment working a reformation, they are almost sure to leave the prison with tiie lessons of hardi a d criminals slumped indellihly upon their minds Tills means that a majority of those young men will follow in fhe footsteps of their ashoei ales in prison and become professional criminals. While it is right that crime should he punished, no matter liv whom com mitted, it is not right to confine U>ys in the iwnitcntiary with the men who usually make up the pjpulatiou of those institutions. The state whose duty it is to protect society should maintain an institution when' punish ment would I ?e meted out to the youth ful criminal away ftvin the association and intluenee of those schooled in crime. ? Nevada needs such an institution to day and the next legislature should provide it. The News in speaking of the necessity for such an institution says: There is a story that never grows old. That is the story of humanity. We ? \vlio<e lines are cast in the pleasant places? forget the erring ones and those whose ways are dark and dreary. To forget is a sin. It is a sin to forget that in the prison on the outskirts of our city are thirteen boys locked up with some of the deepest dyed scoun drels a life of crime ever bred. With them are forty-five youths who have not reached in years a third of the allotted span, and last and not least are f >ur women ? intended to Ik: the crea tures worthy the love and admiral ion of man but now to be scorned and cast aside. Shall they Ik? left during the long years that must come to be the com panions of thc.su whose every teaching is degrading and leading to a coutinous life of crime and eventually thegall ws? Think what the teachings of the man, Carr and his ilK, will be to those thir teen I toys.

A Hotis.' of C irrcetion for the way ward youths i-, an ahs ilute necessity and it is the duty of every voter to impress this up hi the mind* of the men whom their votes have placed in a position to make the plan feasible. I The governor wants it. the press wants it, the people want it and justice and humanity demands it. The H'orld Dtlics Teddy In concluding its reply to lloosevelts special message asking that congress prosecute its editor for liltel, the New York World hurls this defiance at the freak who sits in the presidential chair: "If the World has libeled anybody, we hope it will be punished, but we don't intend tolte intimidated by Roose velt's delimit' iatian, or by Koosevelt's power. No other living man has ever so grossly libelled the United States as does this president, who ltcsmirches congress, bulldozes the judges, assails the integrity of the courts, slanders private citizens; and who has shown himself the most reckless, unscrupulous demagogue whom the American people have ever trusted with great power and authority. We say this not in anger, but in sincere sorrow. The World has im measurably more respect for the office of the president of the United States than Theodore Roosevelt has over shown during the years which lie has maintained a reign of terror and vilified the honor and honesty both of public ortieials and private citizens who oposcd his policies, or thwarted liim in his purpose. So far as the World is concerned, its proprietor may go to jail if Uoosevelt succeeds, as he threatens, but even in s-ti| tke World won't cea.se to be a fear less champion of free speech, free press and a free |?eople." When Teddy reads that he will prob ably ask congress to draw and quarter I'ulitz.er, or burn him at the stake. What punishment is it to put a man in jail who will s ty such things ulmut out great and good president 1 lie should be soused in oil and then burned. N< other punishment will atone for tin offense.

AROUND THE HOUSE PRESENTATION OF GENERAL MATTERS OF INTEREST. Flower Wall Paper Is Most Effective in Bedrooms ? Suggestions as to Blankets ? Valuable Sanitary Crib for the Infant. The fud for flower waJl-paper in bed rooms Is within the reach of those of moderate means. A bedroom should be simple and restful. Iu the flower designs there Is % wide Held for one's individual taste. In planning such a room, one must beur in mind the size, exposure, and woodwork. For a sun ny room, sober colors are jKissible, but a dark room must be treated in a light and cheerful way. A room re cently papered had a morning-glory ef fect. The woodwork was painted white. The floor was hard wood, with several harmonious rag rugs, and the walls were papered with a cream-col ored paper, over which morning glo ries trailed In profusion. The ceiling was also a faint cream color. Dotted swIss curtains hung at the windows just to the sill, and were tied back with white cord and tassels. Thej dressing-room table and bed of white enamel had covers of dotted swIss. Two wicker chairs had cushions of cretonne, and the lied had a cover of the same material. Blankets range in choice from the ligl? weight summer blankets or Ital ian slumber blankets of soft silk to heavy woolen, double or single ones, in solid colors, lavender, pale green, blue, or pink, with a decorative bonier in white. The use of colors is attrac tive in carrying out a color scheme. Woolen blankets keep their softness much longer when sent to the clean ers. Many blankets are sold iu pairs, but most housekeepers prefer to cut them in two, binding the cut edges Where this Is not done, be cure thai the folded edge is plnccd at the foo; of the bed, thus leaving the occupant free to use one or both blankets. When ready to put away your heavy blanket* for the summer, they should be wrapped in a clean muslin bag. A lump of camphor gum laid in the folds \'ill prevent moths. There is a heavy white dimity that makes excellent summer bedspreads. It launders well. Some of these spreads are llnislied with a narrow, white cotton fringe. Something that will interest all mothers Is the infant's sanitary crib, chair, and walker combined. The crib is built of polished wood, trimmed with aluminum, corner pieces, and furnished with a while drill body. The canvas body is so designed that it holds the baby securely, yet comfort ably. and with freedom. Lying down, sitting or standing, it is impossible for | the child to fall out. The crib can be i instantly changed into a chair do i signed to support the baby in every ?posture without straining the body. The canvas (lap In front is used as a table for the child to rest Its toys on. The canvas body is easily changed and can be washed a* often as de sired, therefore insuring sanitary con ditions. A rubber bath tub attachment which is sold separately will be found a great convenience. Never put a deep border on a low ceiling room. It Is really better not to have any at all. A flowered or trel lis effect will do much to give height. If two small rooms are together it is better to paper and carpet allko, giv ing the effect of one room. ? ? .?? j REMEMBERED ONLY TOO WELL. i Farmer Used Well-Learned Phrase at Unfortunate Time. A certain wealthy farmer, who owned broad acres In an aristocratic section of the Hay State not so far distant from lloston, figured among bis neighbors its something of a din mom! In the rough. One of his strong est predilections was to exploit bis rather sllfT opinions of persons In terms that could not be mistaken. Ills two daughters had social aspirations, in the Interest of which they had lo give freiptent lectures on the social I usages of the community. j "When you llnd that you simply i must let t>ut your opinions of the poo j pie you meet," the doling parent was ' Instructed, "please nlways prefaco i your remarks with tli? qualifying clause, 'present company excepted.'" It happened that the aspiring daugh ters were giving n dinner that snfno night al which they fondly hoped lo 1 give the family u big social boost, i'apa got a severe drilling as lo bis table manners, and sal at the head of ? the family table with no III tie trepida tion. Under the inspiring Influence of the wine, however, lie thawed out , perceptibly, and soon was unburden ing his soul of all the opinions thai had accumulated In the course of the ' dinner. Incidentally he gave a vivid account of ull%that Impressed him til* day beforo when ho attended the county fair, which was something of an event in the countryside. "Yes, slreo," went on ttio loquacious family head, "I seen tilings that was wuth goln' miles to seo. And ono ?j thing I see was the best pen of hogs j I ever see ? present company ex j copied." j The speaker could not understand how it was that none of inn guests en thiiscd over the live stock display? not until his daughters got a clinnct to It'll III in.

These little ins?s-ts. always indus trious and hard at work, excavate the ground extensively, building tip mounds sometimes 12 feet in height, and often bringing hits of gold and other metals from their subterranean caverns. The following story will illustrate how this little insect may often lie very useful. A |HH>r prospector, after traveling and exploring the mountains for liiany jvars in the vain hope of "making a strike," as it is called in the mining camps, one day, tired out, exhausted, and completely discouraged, lay down in a lonesome sjiot far from civilization and fell asleep. lie was awakened hy a sharp "nip" on his left leg, and, pulling up his tr.msers, lie saw a large ant, which had crawled there and was evidently trying to make a dinner off his leg. He was not a cruel man, so, instead of killing the insect, he brushed it off, when the little creature raced away as fast as it could in the direction of its home, a large ant hill a few feet dis tant. ? The man looked towards the mound and in a half dreamy, half sleepy con dition watched the little workers there were thousands of them each one b ?nging up a load of sand, gravel, or rock from lielow. A ray of sunshine fell uixni tin nor.nd, which made it sparkle am. ?ciiitillntc as if it were gold instead ol lirt and gravel. .lumping to his feet. In* ran over t> he s|H>t, when, sure enough, all through .lie gravel that hail lieen hauled out were tiny particles of pure gold. It was a colony of mining ants, anil by some freak of chance they haw b: gun t leir excavations directly over a rich lead of gold. The prospector could scarcely lielieve ] bis senses. He knelt there in that j wild forest anil wept tears of joy. Then, catching up bis washing pan, be | niti to tliH creek near bv, and after tlit | .k-wiioti <>t nutters washed out tin- go.d. riie first "cleanup" yielded him tw< hotisanil dollars. Looking further, he found Ihret ?ther ant lulls, and at every one thou ..inds of the insects were working hard, ?ringing up gold, gravel, and sand .iidiscrimiiiatfly. lb- was a rich man roni that time forth. A-> fast as be carried away the bill lie ants would build it up again, lb iad sense enough not to "kill tie- geese .vho were laying tie* golden e^g." .ml instead of digging into tin- earth lilllsclf lie allowed the aiits to do his ?lining for him. Kverv Saturday lie paid a visit to all lie bills and made a "cleanup." always realizing a snug little pile of the Iteau t if n 1 yellow particles. Hut after a while the tints lieciiuie discouraged at the disappearance of their mound*, and one hy one they gradually abandon* d t hem. It may perhaps be as well to state thai the story comes from America. From the Family Herald, London. Thr Dajs ol '62 (Jul. flyman is iu receipt of a letter from Sail Francisco that carries him back to I SIM.
