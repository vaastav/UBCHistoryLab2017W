PRESIDENT TAFT SENDS MESSAGE TO THE SIXTY-FIRST NATIONAL CONGRESS General Satisfaction Expressed With Terse and Brief Docu ment, by Members of Both Houses-Congress Finds Itself Out of Job-Awaits Committee Action W ASHINGTON, Dec. 7.--Having s sembled and received the presi dent's annual message, congress today found itself literally "out of work," and in consequence both houses adjourned until Friday, when,' if some of the various committees fail to provide something to do adjourn ment will be taken until Monday. The formality of reading the mes sage consumed an hour and a half in each house. When the conclusion was .reached, the house immediately ad journed, but the senate went into executive session. Little fault was found with the message among Re publicans, who seemed to agree that it was as satisfactory a document as the president could prepare and re main consistent with the party's cam paign pledges. The Democrats ap proved the president's effort to econo mize, but deprecated his suggestion that the Monroe doctrine has become practically obsolete. "The message is written in the president's customary terse, vigorous style," commented Representative Payne, majority leader in the house, while Representative Clark, minority leader, thought that about all that could be said about the message was that it was comparatively brief, "as discussion of almost all important matters is relegated to special mes sages." In both houses the message was subjected to most careful scrutiny. Following the custom, the message was referred to the committee of the whole to be prepared for vivisection by various committees whose business it is to deal with subjects discussed by the president in his message. The senate adjourned at 2:30 o'clock, out of respect to the memory, of Representative De Armond of Mis-I souri and Representative Lassiter of, West Virginia. The house adjourned at 1:50 o'clock. In beginning, the president says: "The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have; continued on the normal basis ofi amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory." President Taft says the Zelaya gov ernment of Nicaragua has kept Central America in constant turmoil. It is unnecessary, he says, "to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable bar barities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelayan gov ernment. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were re ported to have been regularly com missioned officers in the organized foroes of the revolution, and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they would be entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war." He continues: "At the time when this message is printed this government has severed diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the former Nicaraguan charge d'affairs, and is intending to take such further steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American in terests and its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may be necessary for me to bring this subject to the attention of con gress in a special message." Concerning the far east, the presi dent says this government preserves unchanged its policy of supporting the open door and adds: "Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has I proved to work satisfactorily." Reorganization of the department of state on modern lines in further ance of our foreign trade and of; American interests abroad is recom mended. Economy of Expenditures. "Perhaps," continues the message, "the most important question pre sented to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and suf ficilency of revenue. "'The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditure for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the receipts by $34, 075,620.12. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Pan ama canal, amounting to $38,000,000 $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be increased to a total deficit of $73,075,620.12. This deficit, the secretary is to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this proposal." The president says the cost of en gineering and construction of the canal which will be completed Jan. 1, 1915, will be $297,766,000, instead of $139,705,200, as originally estimated, and other expenses increase the cost by $75,435,000 to a total of $375, 201,000. The president is advised by the sec retary. of the treasury that the esti mates of the expenditures of the gov ,rnment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, that is, for the next' fiscal year, are less by $55 663,091.19 than the total of appropriation for the current fiscal year, and adds: "So far as the secretary of the treas ury is able to form a judgment as to future income and compare it with' the expenditures for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1911, including the payments on account of the Pan ama canal and the public debt, there will be no den ' .n the year ending June 30, 1911, but a small surplus of $712,000. "In the present estimates the needs of the department and of the govern ment have been cut to the quick, so to speak, and any assumption of con gress, so often made in times past, that estimates have been prepared with the expectation that they may be reduced, will result in seriously ham pering proper administration." There is room for improvement in the treatment of government em ployes, the president declares. "Under the present system it constantly hap pens that two employes receive the same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important and exacting than that of the other. Su perior ability is not rewarded or en couraged. As the classification is now entirely by salary, an employe often rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work for which he alone may be fitted. "An investigation ordered by my predecessor resulted in the recom mendation that the civil list be re classified according to the kind of work, so that the work requiring most application and knowledge and ability shall receive most compensation. I believe such a change would be fairer to the whole force and would perma nently improve the personnel of the service. "Most of the industrial organiza tions and many of the well conducted railways of this country are coming to the conclusion that a system of pensions for old employes and the su1bstitution therefor of younger and more energetic servants promotes both economy and efficiency of admin istration. "I am aware that there is a strong feeling in both houses of congress and also in the country against the estab lishment of civil pensions, and that this has naturally grown out of the heavy burden of military pensions, which it has always been the policy of our government to assume; but I am strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficultier presented by the superannuation of civil employes can be found than a system of civil pensions." Prosecute Sugar Frauds. President Taft refers to the sugar frauds recently discovered, sayin: that the settlement made with the so-called trust will not interefere witk or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to bI subject to the same. He believes thai an investigation of the frauds by con. gress at present would be inadvisable saying it might give immunity apc otherwise prove an embarrassment it securing conviction of the guilty par ties. President Taft then discusses thi tariff and the operation of the maxi. mum and minimum clause in the act He says that in the working of this fear has been expressed that thi power conferred and duly imposed or the executive is likely to lead to i tariff war. No Tariff War Expected. "I beg to express the hope and be lief that no such result may be an ticipated," Mr. Taft says. "No one ii seeking a tariff war or a condition i, which the spirit of retaliation shall 6( aroused." The new tariff board is discussed the president saying that their worl will perhaps take two or three years A continuing annual appropriation it asked. "I believe," the president continues "that the work of this board will bE of prime importance whenever con gress shall deem it wise again to ad just the customs duties. If the factE secured by the board are of such a character as to show, generally, that the rates of duty imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as de scribed in the platform of the suc cessful party at the late election. I shall not hesitate to invite the atten tion of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated tharann "Nothing, however, halts business and interferes with the course of pros. perity so much as the threatened re vision of the tariff and until the facts are at hand, after careful and delib erate investigation, upon which revi sions can properly he undertaken it seems to me unwise to attempt it. "The amount of misinformation that creeps into arguments pro and con in respect to the tariff rates is such as to require the kind of investigation undertaken by it wholly without re spect to the effect which the facts may have in calling for a readjust ment of the rates of duty." Army Retrenchment. A reduction in the estimates of the war department for the coming fiscal year, which brings the total estimates down to an amount $45,000,000 less than the corresponding estimate for last year is mentioned by the presi dent, all progress in military matters being suspended for a year as a con sequence. These measures can hardly be more than temporary, the executive says. Later he will send a special message to congress upon military matters. Concurring in needed changes in the army, he places emphasis upon the need for an elimination bill. "The coast defenses of the United States proper are generally all that could be desired and in some respects they are rather more elaborate than under present conditions are needed to stop an enemy's fleet from entering the harbors defended." The president concurs in the jude ment of the military and naval joint board in favor of making an exten sive naval base at Pearl harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. The president then discusses the navy, the need for reform, economy in expenditures, etc. He says: "A comprehensive plan for the re organization of the officers of all corps of the navy will be presented to congress, and I hope it will meet with action suitable to its exigencies." The appointment of an officer as head of the naval observatory is rec ommended. President on Injunctions. President Taft says that in his judg ment a change in judicial procedure with a view to reducing its obstacles to private litigation in civil cases and facilitating the despatch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, constitutes the great est need in our American institutions. A commission to consider reforms in the judiciary is recommended. The president recommends, in com pliance with the promise made in the Republican platform that appropriate legislation relating to the issuance of injunctions be adopted. Previous no tice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on behalf of the parties to be enjoined are urged by the presi dent with certain exceptions. On this subject the president ex presses his opinion in the following emphatic language: "The ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint against ill considered injunctions without notice will be removed 'by the enactment of a 'statute forbidding hereafter the issuing of any injunc tion or restraining order, whether temporary or permanent, by any fed eral court, without previous notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard on the part of the parties to be enjoined; unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would result in irreparable injury to the complainant and unless, also, the court shall from the evidence make a written finding, which shall be spread upon the court minutes, that immediate and irreparable in jury is likely to ensue to the com plainant, and shall define the injury, state why it is irreparable and shall also indorse on the order issued the date and the hour of issuance of the order. "Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order issued without pre vious notice and opportunity by the defendant to be heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issu ance thereof, or within any time less than that period which the court may fix, unless within such seven days or such less period, that injunction or order is extended or renewed after previous notice and opportunity to be heard." President Taft then refers to anti trust and interstate commerce laws which will be discussed in a special message. The president says the actual loss growing out of the transmission of second class mail matter amounts to about $63,000,000 a year. Congress, he says, may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit by imposing a higher rate of postage on magazines and periodicals. Postal Savings Banks. President Taft says he is convinced the people desire postal savings banks' and that they will be productive of the utmost good. He says of them: "They will furnish a satisfactory substitute for the system of a gov ernment guarantee of deposits, which, with deference to those who advocate it, .seems to me to have in it the seeds of demoralization to conservative banking and certain financial disas ter." The president earnestly recomends the passage of a ship subsidy bill. In recommending separate statehood for New Mexico and Arizona, President Taft advises that after the adoption of a constitution it be submitted to the, people for approval. State officers should not be elected until the con-' stitution has been voted upon. "With respect to Alaska," says the president, "I recommend legislation which shall provide for the appoint ment by the president of a governor and also of an executive council, the members of which shall, during their i terms of office, reside in the terri tory, and which shall have legisla tive powers sufficient to enable it to Sgive the territory local laws adapted! to its present growth. I strongly dep- i recate legislation looking to the elec t ion of a territorial legislature in that vast district." Conservation Recommended. sity for legislation looking to the fur ther conservation of natural resources and announces that a special mes sage on this subject, including that e of waterways. reclamation, irrigation,, r foresting, etc., will be sent to con gress soon. Transfer of control over the light house to a suitable civilian bureau is recommended, because of frequent , friction due to the absence of any t central independent authority. t White slavery is discussed in view i of it being deemed that there is 3 urgent necessity for additional legi.- a lation and greater executive activity c to suppress it. "I believe it to he constitutional." t the president says, '" to forbid, under t penalty, the transportation of persons u for purposes of prostitution across , national and state lines, and by ap propriating a fund of $50,000 to be used 'by the secretary of commerce and labor for the employment of special inspectors it will be posstble to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction under a federal law." After calling attention to the good work performed by the civil service commission,, the president makes this recommendation under the head of "political contributions:" "I urgently recommend to congress that a law .be passed requiring that candidates in elections of members of the house of-representatives, and com mittees in charge of their candidacy and campaign, file in a proper office of the United States government a statement of the contributions re ceived and of the expenditures in curred in the campaign for such elec tions, and that similar legislation be enacted in respect to all other elec tions which are constitutionally within the control of the congress." The president says that while the medical departmentsof the army and navy must be kept separate, there seems no reason why all the other bureaus and officers in the general government which have to do with the public health, should not be united in a bureau to be called the "Bureau of Public Health." In conclusion the president says: "Speaking generally, the country is in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business expansion, and we have just garnered a harvest unexcelled in the market value of our agricultural production. The high -prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community, but on the other hand they mean a very considerable increased burden upon those classes in the community whose yearly com pensation does not expand with the improvement in business and the gen eral prosperity. "Various reasons are given for the high prices. The proportionate in crease in the output of gold, which to day is the medium of exchange and in some respect a measure of values. furnishes a substantial explanation of at least part of the increase in prices The increase in population and more expensive mode of living of the peo ple, which has not been accompanied by a proportionate increase in acreage production, may furnish a further reason. "It is well to note that the increase in, the cost of living is not confined to this country, but prevails the world over, and that those who would charge increased prices to the exist ing protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost wholly in those products of the factory and farm in respect to which there has been either no in crease in the tariff or in many In stances a very considerable reduc tion." - 4--------- 

FRANCHISES REFUF1n TO TWO PROMOTERS Two Applications for Gas Franchises Turned Down On Account of Excessive Cbarge. From Wednesday's Daily. The council last evening instructec the city attorney to take steps againsi the Mutual Heating company for at alleged failure to heat the city hall. The committee on franchises re ported on two applications for gai franchises, one from J. J. Knight ol Kalamazoo, concerning the terms o. which considerable publicity has al ready been given, and one from A. J Nichols of Perry, Iowa. The Knight franchise offered to supply gas al $1.80 and the Nichols franchise al $1.57%, and on account of the price specified and for other objections the committee saw fit to return an ad verse report. The report of the com mittee was adopted, and the city clerk instructed to write the applicants stating their objections to the fran. chises, and requesting that some fur ther investigation of the field be made in an attempt to lower the price and comply with the wishes of the council in regard to a franchise. The commit tee reported that on investigation it had reached the conclusion that gas should he sold here at $1.50 gross, or about $1.35 with the customary dis counts. (1. .M. Fletcher was awarded the contract for furnishing the fire de partment with 1,000 feet of fire hose at $1 a foot. The Civic Choral club was given permission to practice in the city hall every Friday evening and to move a piano in the room. The club is newly organized and is comprised of all the singers of the city, its object being to give two oratorios during the present winter season, the pro,..eds of which will be applied to scme deserving fund. The intake of the Sixth avenue sewer was reported to again be in bad condition and in such a shape that a sudden change in tile weather would result in the flooding of much prop erty. The sewer committee and the engineer were ordered to inspect the intake and to make such repairs as were found to be necessary. An ordinance restricting the district in which saloons shall be opened was passed. The district is bounded by a line beginning at the intersection of Twenty-second street and the North ern Pacific right-of-way, running north to a point 25 feet south of the southerly property line of First ave nue north, west to the alley between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth, south to a point 25 fet from the north prop erty line of First avenue south, east to Twenty-second and north to the point of beginning, with the exception of the rear 25 feet of the lot on which the new Morris block stands. This keeps the saloons on Montana and Minnesota avenues and off of First avenue north and south, with the ex ception of the east storeroom of the Morris block, a license for the opera tion of a saloon in which has already been granted to Lee & McNaught. The ordinance was first introduced by Alderman Frith. 

RESULTS WILL BE THE SAME So Says Secretary of Y. M. C. A. In Comparing Billngs With Capitol of Idaho. INTERURBAN DEVELOPS Says That What Has Been Acco-. plished in Boise Can Be Easily Done Here-Good Roads Committee Pre. paring Bill for Legislature. From Wednesday's Daily. "Under the interurban systems which traverse the Boise valley, Boise, Idaho, has grown from a town of 10,000 to a metropolitan city of 30,000; and the results will be the same, only in a larger measure, when the interurbans begin running out of this city and the many acres of the Yellowstone valley are planted in or chards." Such was the statement made yes terday at the luncheon of the Cham ber of Commerce by Secretary Witham of the Y. M. C. A., who came to Bill ings a few months ago to take charge of the association work here. and who has been in Boise for the past eight years and has witnessed the growth of that city and the marvelous re sults which have been obtained under the two interurban lines which run out of it. Boise is not as favorably situated as is Billings. It is on a branch line of the railroad and is in no way a commercial and business center in the broader sense, but the building of the interurban lines has been the means of placing a family on every 10 and 20 acres for miles up and down the valley, and this added population and added productive pos sibilities of the land has increased the population of the city 20,000 during the eight years that Mr. Witham made his home there. In speaking of the growth of Boise, he said: When I first came to Boise I got off the train at a dilapidated station and toiled through several blocks of mud and over broken wooden side walks to the business part of the city. The place was accredited with a popu lation of 6,000, according to the gov ernment census, but it claimed 10,000. Now those muddy streets are paved and the city boasts a population of 30,000 and can substantiate the fig ures. Two interurban companies operate out of Boise, their lines run ning many miles up and down the valley, and the streets of the city are a network of metropolitan car lines. Land that sold at from $10 to $50 an acre before the interurbans were built is now divided into five and 10-acre tracts, which, if the orchards on them are young and just begin ning to bear, cannot be purchased for $1,000 an acre. I recently received a letter from an old friends in Boise, who tells me that land over a mile from any interurban line is being di vided into five-acre tracts, which sell for $1,500. "The prosperity brought by the in terurbans had a marked effect on the city. Streets were parked on either side as well as paved, old-fashioned fences disappeared and the property owners planted flowers and lawns to make their places less bare and unin viting. And the paving situation is one thing that Billings must at once take care of if she hopes to continue to go forward. Investors who land in Billings in muddy weather are not greatly impressed with the streets in their present condition." Mr. Witham opened his speech with a few remarks about the work of the Y. M. C. A., declaring that every busi ness man in the city owed it to him self and the city to take an active interest in the work of the associa tion. In this he was seconded by Messrs. Snell and O'Donnell, both members of the board of directors of the association, who declared that the association now has a man at its head who can conduct it as a strictly business proposition, and can, if given the proper assistance, make the insti tution self-supporting through its membership fees and rentals. To do this, it was pointed out, will require a membership of about 700, and it is boped that every business man in the city will take one of the various forms of membership which are offered. Judge Goss spoke at some length on the growth of the orcharding in dustry and suggested that steps be taken for the carrying on of experi mental work which will determine just what varieties of apples and what classes of soil are the best for what ir practically an infant industry in th:, Yellowstone valley. \V. S. (Garnsey. chairman of the cor. n!t-te on good roads, reported that lis commit:ee since its appoint lmenlt has assembled a large volume of information concerning the laws oc) othlir states ('overing state appro priations for road improvements. The county commissioners, Mr. Garnsey said, feel that they cannot with the mlans at hand any more than care for the many new roads which are be ing opened and keep those already in existence in good repair, and that so far as the county is concerned it can not at the present time take up the work of macadamizing any of the main country highways. This being the case the committee is preparing to present a bill to the next legislature which will place some state aid to the credit of the good roads movement. Either the issuance of bonds or the aid of convict labor. or both. will be asked for, and it is hoped that Montana will take action similar to that of other states, and contribute toward the establishment of good country roads. The bond is sue, it was pointed out, would be no more than a fair proposition, for the benefit of improved roads will be de rived as much by the coming genera tion as by the present one. 1. 1). O'I)onnell, a member of the committee, suggested the 'writing of letters to the boards of county com missioners and the commercial asso ciations of the counties of the south ern part of the state in an attempt to interest them in the building of a main state road which will run from Glendive to Helena or Missoula. Such a road, as was pointed out by Louis Hill a few weeks ago, will tend to bring many wealthy tourists to the state, who will ship their autos to Glendive or Billings and from this point motor through the state and into Yellowstone park. As is well known, the tourist trade is a very lucrative one, and to establish Montana as a tourist state will mean the expendi ture of millions of dollars here an nually. Mr. O'Donnell declared that ample material for the macadamizing of such a road is at hand and that gravel in large quantities cn be found within every mile of the road. In case it cannot the railroads are will ing to haul it free, for the develop ment of good wagon roads means as much to the railroads as to the coun try which they will traverse. Mr. O'Donnell suggests the building of the state road by counties, and declared that the people of Yellowstone county w ere willing to bear the expense of such a highway from Custer on the east to Columbus on the west. Seth Marshall, son of the head of Marshall, Wells & Co. of Duluth, who was for a year a resident of this city, was called upon for a speech. Mr. Marshall declared that his house has never regretted the establishment of its branch in this city, and that, in his opinion, as well as in the opinion of many members of the Duluth firm, Billings is on the rapid road to be coming the distributing point of the northwest. Manufacturing plants will, according to Mr. Marshall, follow close in the wake of the jobbers. He emphasized the necessity of lower freight rates and added that he trusted the fight for equitable rates will terminate favorably to the inter ests of this city.
