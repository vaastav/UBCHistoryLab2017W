BURGLAR USED ETRER BUT VICTIM AWOKE Midnight Intruder Made His Getaway Before Intended Victim Could Give Alarm COL STURG1S SAYS STATEHOOD, RETICENT OH GOVERNORSHIP TUCSON, Dec. 1"4. -(Special.) E. J. Whlsler, the stenographer In the Blcknell offices, popular musician and playwright of this city, had a narrow escape a couple ot nights ago from being tho principal in a near tragedy that stil sets his hair to stand ing on end, when ho. allows his mind to dwell on it. Mr. Whlsler lives on the corner of Fourth avenue and Twelfth street, this city, and has had the habit com mon to so aiany Tucsonans, of sleep ing outdoors. Likewise bo has a large bull dog. which occasionally takes an all night siesta underneum his couch. On this particular night in question. Mr. whlsler came to consciousness some time during tho night with a feeling that there was some other presence in his Immediate neighbor hood. He raised up his head and or dered the dog, when he saw tho head and shoulders of a man appear In sight at the head of the cot. Tho intruder got away hurriedly through too fact 'that Whlsler was too surprised to move, and that ho was not loaded for "bear" of that description. , But the strange and startling tea. ture of the episode was noticed . few minutes later. On being thor oughly aroused. Mr. Whlsler began tu make an lnvest'gatlon, with which" he had not proceeded very far, when no aiscernea tne odor or etner. it grew stronger and stronger until he founu that his face and pillow had been sat urated with it. The evident conclu sion Is that some thief was endeavor ing to get him unconscious before rob bing tho house.

TUC80N, Dec. 11. (Special.) Col. W. S. Sturgls, the Republican national committeeman from the ter r'tory, and Just now tho only big gun of tho party in Arizona, ho Is not In Washington with a great flourish of trumpets, promising to get statehood for the two commonwealths, because of tho election of Ralph Cameron to Congress, went out to his La Osa ranch Saturday, after having been In the city for several days, on personal and jwlltical business. Before going Col. Sturgls was seen by a reporter of theStar, and asked primarily as to wfiat bis belief was In tho matter of tho early granting cf statehood.' "I see that Gov. Kibbey and other prominent Republicans are now m Washington, ostensibly pursuing th statehood fight," he beganV "I am sure that they will do all they can, as well as will Mark Smith and otnei Arlzonans, who are there at tho pres ent time. The declaration of the He publican party and her leaders m favor of Immediate statehood for the territory was undoubtedly blncere, as was proven by tha recommendation oi President Roosevelt that both Arizona and New Mexico be admitted. I am sure that tha party will pass the burs through this pension of congress. It they are not crowded out by a press ot business, that win not permit tho consideration of new legislation. In any event It is a moral certainty that tho special cession, which Pres ident Taft will all about the midule of next March to revise the tariff, will take the action which we have been, fighting for.so Jbns-T. , "Col. Sturgls, 'is Ure La Osa pasture to furnish the next territorial govern or?" ho was asked. Then the Interview came to an ena.
