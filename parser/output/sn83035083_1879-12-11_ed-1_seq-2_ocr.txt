We do not trust these Credit Mobilier, De- Gollyer frauds. Stark Co. Dera, Back I ma; dwbi. The financial recommendations of Mr. Hayes and Secretary Sherman don't seem to meet with a very hearty reception even in their own party, and they are preparing for a square back down upon the subject. The recent pronunciamentos of those function aries demanding the retirement of greenbacks and the demonetization of silver, produoed quite a sensation and bid fair to create a row in the Radical ranks that would burst the rotten con cern into flinders and scatter its frag ments to the four winds. Had these financial views of Hayes and Sherman been proclaimed before our lste elec tion the result would have been very different from what it was. Several of the Republican members of Con gress seeing the blonder of their Pres ident, are making haste to repair the damage that would be likely to follow, by ofleriog joint resolutions declaring against any tampering with financial matters, and in favor of leaving them where Democratic legislation has plac ed them, with silver remonetized and the volume of greenbacks required to be maintained .to the amount of about $346,000,000. For the present the pros pect is that a row between the Radical factions is likely to be avoided by the Eastern goldites consenting to keep quiet and await a more convenient time for surreptitiously forcing through their pet schemes. Let the people re member the Radical snake is only scotched ; it is not dead. It is the general impression that Bayard, the great statesman of the lit tie State of Delaware, did not materi ally improve his chances for the Demo cratic nomination for President by com ing to the aid of Hayes and Sherman in their financial scheme, by offering a joint resolution in the Senate to take away the legal-tender quality of the greenbacks, making them merely Treasury notes, payable in specie at the will of the holder aod receivable for all dues to the United States ex cepting duties on imports. Inasmuch as Mr. Bayard would make the green back redeemable in coin at all times and at all the government agencies, it is difficult to comprehend what sense there Is . in making the exception against receiving them for duties on imports. It is certainly against the well known sentiment of the Democ racy who have persistently demanded that the Government should fully honor its own paper by receiving it for all purposes without exception While Hayes and Sherman are being snubbed by their own party friends, it seems a very inopportune moment for Mr. Bayard to come to the frout as the champion of the money power. General Woodford, of New York, was the only Republican visiting statesman to Louisiana dnring the late political contest in that State. He went there for the purpose of making speeches to enlighten the people on the subject of their interest and duty, and we presume faithfully fulfilled the duties of his mission. The General his returned to his friends and there is no account of his having been in any way interfered with or molested in the free and full discussion of po litical questions, and yet the Democ racy have carried that State by an in creased majority over that of 1S7C when the vote was stolen by the vil lainous Radical Returning Board un der the management of Northern visit ing statesmen, to seat in the Presiden tial chair a man who was neyer elected. Foratataiels) Wsssi Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, says that he is in favor of legislation which will prohibit the Sec retary of the Treasury from selling another four per cent, bond under any circumstances. "That liberty, which he now has, we shall imperatively stop, Then we propose that be shall take one hundred million dollars of bis coin, and hold it awaiting oppor tunities to boy bonds. His coin lies idle and sboold be used. We pro pose, also, that there shall be no fail ure in refunding from lack of oppor tunity. It is our intention to pass a refunding bill as soon as possible, and give the one hundred million dollars of coin to use with the bonds ; bnt no bill can pass that gives more than a three and a half per cent, bond." Mr. Wood says, also, that he believes the people want as little financial legisla tion as possible ; that they want the greenbacks let alone, and that they also want a refunding bill passed. Grant ' Ahead. A Leavenworth, Ks., dispatch of the 4th inst. says : " The Times, to-mor row morning, will print the views of editors of Kansas on the Presidential question as gleaned from replies to a circular sent to each newspaper. Of the Republicans one-half express de cided preferences for the ticket com posed of U. S. Grant for President and James G. Blaine for Vice-President. The Democrats prefer either Seymour or Bayard for President and Hen dricks or McDonald for Vice-President. A number, while opposed to Grant's nomination, admit its proba bility, and say they will support him. LOUISIANA ELECTION. The Stmte Denuatcratlc bjr a Sparge majority The new Constitution Adopted.

Youko Schaller, tha son of the rich brewer who was on a spree in the vi cinity of the spot where Baldwin was shot in Cincinnati some time ago, has brought suit Cor libel against the En quirer Company for $50,000 damages for the sensational article which ap peared in that paper a few weeks ago throwing aaspicion upon Schaller and bis friends. A Demand far Equality. Representative Weaver, the Green- backer of Iowa, has presented at infla tion scheme to the House, which au thorizes an appropriation of fifty-five millions of dollars, so that soldiers and sailors of the late war shall be paid the difference in value between the cur rency which he received and the stand ard gold coin of the United States, in which he should have been paid, to gether with six per cent, per annum from the date said soldiers and sailors were mustered out of the service of the United States up to the date of the payment of the sum found due him by the provisions of the Weaver act. Secretary McCrart in his annual report says: "The annual expendi tures of the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, were $42,653,753 62. The appropriations available for the service of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, aggragated $45,076,702 97; and those for 1879 were $53,015,040 96, and those for the currant fiscal year amounted to $46, 269,821.94. The estimates for the ser vice of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428 93, to which amount they have been reduced from $54,306,643.14, for which they were originally submitted to me. The mil itary establishment is estimated for on the basis of 25,450 enlisted men. The Signal Corps being by law allowed 450 men not to be included in the 25, 000 men." As the time for the meeting of the Ohio Legislature draws near and the sentiment of the Republican members become known, it is apparent that Gen. Garfield holds the lead in the race for the Uniled States Senatorship, While he has not a majority of the members pledged to his support, yet it is believed that no combination can be formed to defeat him. In speaking of the opposition to him, the Wash ington Post says : "Implacable hostil ity to Garfield has not been develop ed. Some of his opponents are using the DeGolyer pavemeut scandal to his injury, but an affair of that kind will scarcely be fatal. There have been too many corruptions in Radical his tory for the party to take alarm at such matters at this date. If Mr. Gar field is ruined by this effort of his op ponents it will be because he didn't get $100,000 instead of a paltry $5,000." The ruling sentiment of both par ties in Congress seems inclined to avoid a discussion of the currency question and not disturb the present status of monetary affairs. This will hardly suit the gold clique who de sire to have the recommendations of Hayes and Secretary Sherman carried out with a view to making money scarce and dearer that they may be able to control the financial affairs of the country, regardless of the welfare of the government or the people. Hav ing secured the remonetization of sil ver and prohibited the retirement and destruction of greenbacks, the Democ racy can afford to leave the present condition of the currency question un disturbed for a time and devote their attention to questions of more press ing importance. The Austrian Congress has recently fixed the war footipg of the army of that Nation at 800,000 men. Austria has a "strong goyernment" such as the Radical politicians want for this Na tion, with an army that will prevent the people from doing themselves irrepar able damage. Our little army of 25, 000 costs this year $42,653,723.02 for its maintenanco,whicb is thought by many to be an extravgant sum, bnt when it shall be increased to correspond with the grand ideas of the Radical leaders and with the splendid establishments of the "strong governments" of the old world, Uncle Samuel will have an abundant use for all his spare change. Xbe Canee of the Business Beam. Ben Butler was interviewed by an Enquirer reporter and attributed the "revival of that business" to its legetl mate cause. lie said "That expansion has come through the IdQux of gold, which has arisen from the balance of trade in onr favor from the sale of our agricultural and other products abread, which, coming here as currency, has been expansion. They call this infla tion ; but how a currency is to be in flated when the inflating element is composed of that which is valuable. per se, is a question that I leave to others wiser than I am. That it can be expanded by that means I agree. Correspondent Do you agree with Comptroller Knox that that expansion is dangerous and unwise ? General Butler Without that ex pansion neither Comptroller Knox nor any body else would have seen the good times upon which the President so fully congratulates the country, would have come. Without that ex pansion the Resumption Act would not have been executed. To test this it would be seen at once that if Prov idence had sent upon this country the famine and upon Europe plenty, so that we had to buy our breadstuff's by sending our gold out instead of selling them to bring it in, I think neither Comptroller Knox, Secretary Sher man nor Mr. Hayes would have con gratulated the country, either upon its good times or the execution of the Resumption Act. Their Occupation. The Secretary of State has just re ceived the report as to the occupations of the members of the next General Assembly, from which it is found that it will contain 41 lawyers, 41 farmers, 5 editors, 5 bankers, 12 doctors, 22 merchauts, 7 manufacturers, 1 artist, 1 horse dealer,l cattle dealer,l brick ma son, 1 preaeher, dentist, 1 surveyor and 1 teacher. 130,000 Persons Starving-. A Berlin correspondent estimates that 150,000 persons are suffering from famine in Upper Silesia, mostly Poles. The Government is working energet ically for their relief. Tng superintendent of the census asserts that the law providing for the taking of the next census, passed by the last Congress, is perfect in every detail. This is a compliment to the care displayed by the Democrats in framing their laws which is well deserved. Washington, Letter. From Our Regular Correspondent. Washington, D. C, Nov. 5, 1879. Congress Is again at it. First blood for the Democrats. The President's attack on the currency, with John Sherman at his back, has had a most discouraging effect upon the Republi cans, and they have been in solemn conclave ever since the missile fell in their midst, endeavoring to harmonize among themselves, but, so far without real effect. Senator Edmunds is busied with suggestions, but, as the matter is of such a nature as to bar him from ex ercising his Mephistolian attributes of chicanery and trickery, his peace making efforts hardly suffice to cause his brethren to dwell together in peace and harmony. The financial fight promises to be a defensive one for the Democrats, and they propose to make good use of their advantages. Beyond the profuse dis- play of flowers with which friends of the Senators and members decorated many of the desks, and the tables of the chairmen, the opening on Monday was wholly devoid of interest or varie ty. Mr. Randall was highly favored with floral contributions, none of which came from some Government conservatory, and his face displayed his appreciation of the gifts as he called the House to order and entered upon the routine which precedes the recep tion of the President's Message. As the press had anticipated the Message, thus acquainting all with its points few remained to listen to its reading. The members pocketed their copies, which were laid on each desk, and disappear ed, leaving the Clerk to read to empty seats, and we venture to say that no annual message of the past had less weight with Congress than will have this tame effort of his fraudulency, Hayes. Vacant desks received it, and unless we mistake the adverse feeling so far expressed, Congress will allow vacancy to hold its suggestions. Little will be done prior to January 1, beyond arranging programmes of labor for the long session which is inevitable, and the absence of the lobby interest is quite noticeable. . General legislation only brings these fellows here, partic ularly such as are interested in saving the infamous Indian frauds from de molition. Carl Sehurz is intensely ex cited over the expressed determination of Mr. Scales, chairman of the House Indian Committee, to go to the bottom of the frauds and fizzles of the Interior Department in Indian matters. The improvements made in and about the Capitol have been extensive, and conduce largely to its beauty. The broad approaches, which extend from the avenues through the grounds on the west to the Capitol terrace, have been laid in ornamental concrete, with guarding walls of white and blue stone, and give much effect. The ventilating ducts are complete. Paint and polish have been freely used throughout the building. Brumidi'a fresco in the ro tunda has been so extended that the visitor can appreciate the full beauty and grandeur of the painting which, as a work of the painter's art surpasses all others in the Capitol, save those magnificent pictures of Moran, repre senting scenes in the Yellow Stone re gion. The recommendation of the Secre tary of the Treasury, in his report.and of the Presideut in bis Message, favor ing the retirement of the greenback from circulation, has developed a de cided opposition to such a measure among most of the Republican mem mere from the West, and among both Democrats and Republicans from the South. For two days it was the sub ject of discussion in the coat-rooms, in the lobbies, and on the floor of the House, but now a calm succeeds the breeze, out of which there came the audible whisper from the potent voice of a strong majority " The cir culating medium shall not be decreas ed, and the business of the country destroyed by such legislation!" The most important legislation an ticipated this session is a revision of the tariff. Whether tea, that beverage for which our forefathers raised such a row in Boston harbor, is to be the ob ject of taxation, or quinine, which feeds our statesmen to preserve their lives near the tadpole flats of the Po tomac, has not yet been determined. The stealing and publication of the President's Message and the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, before they were given to Congress, is still the subject of investigation, much dis cussion, and, with a few, some swear ing. Many theories and speculations are advanced as to the manner of pil fering them, and several fertile schemes set on foot by the Executive branch of the Government to get these documents, in future, to Congress be fore the fingers of the thief takes them away and sells them for $250. It is not the first instance of the kind, and therefore they will tax their ingenuity only for the next administration to fall into the same trap. In 1867 President Johnson's message got into the papers before it was read to Congress, and it was stated that the many journals pub lishing it paid $100 each for the docu ment. Notwithstanding this experi ence and renewed vigilance, in 1868 Secretary of the Treasury McCulIoch was startled by reading his report in a New York paper several days before it was given to Congress. The Republicans of the District of Columbia who have voluntarily re mained disfranchised for some years, in consequence of the great Influx of ragged and destitute Africans from all portions of the South, voting for any thing that brought taxation to proper ty holders, are now organizing with a view to be reinstated with the rights of an American citizen and the power of the ballot. At a meeting held sev eral days since, Major A. C. Richards was chosen president,and Hon. Robert G. Iugersoll and other prominent Re publicans elected vice presidents. They were eloquently addressed by lion. Robert Iugersoll, who made no allu sion to the mistakes of Moses, but dwtjjf principally upon the mistakes of Congress. Four car-loads of colored emigrants from Goldsboro, N. C, passed through this city a few days ago, on their way to Indiana. They are healthy-looking and well-behaved people, of all grades and sexes. All of them, except about twenty, had paid their fare through to Indiana, where, they alleged, they in tended to make their future home. It yas a solid Republican delegation, and Que of the old Africans, with a face as black as polished ebony, apd wool as white as a ball of cotton, said; "I fuel jus' like one ob de chillun ob Israel goin' to de promts' lau'." x Xhe Remit in New York.
