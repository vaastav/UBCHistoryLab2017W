Washington, Dec. 6.—After the read ing of the journal in the senate to-day the presiding officer asked whether it was the pleasure of the senate to proceed with the nfiual morning business. Senator Harris suggested that bills and memorials might be introduced and re ferred. Senator Hoar opposed the proposition, stating that it was an ancient custom of the senate not to enter upon any ordinary busi ness nntil after hearing the communication from the president at the beginning of the session. That it was a mark of respect due from the legislative department of the gov ernment to the executive. He therefore moved a recess for an hour. The motion agreed to. After the recess had been extended for a quarter of an hour longer, Mon ill reported that the joint committee appointed to wait upon the president had performed its duty, and been informed that the president would immediately communicate with con gress in writing. Thereupon several mén agés were presented by the president's private secretary. McCook, secretary of the senate, com menced reading the president's message, which was finished, at 1 :30, after which an adjournment was taken. The .Senate. Washington, Dec. 7.—In the senate this morning after the presentation ot vari ons communications from heads of depart ments and the court of claims, Senator Cullom remarked that the rule was when bills are introduced before committees are appointed, to have such bills laid on the table and that created unnecessary work. He therefore moved that|the senate adjourn, but be withdrew his motion temporality to permit Senator Plumb to offer a resolution calling upon the commissioner of agricul ture for information as to whether any per son in the employment of that department making experiments as to the manufacture of sugar and sorghum had obtained ot applied for a patent or patents connected with such manufacture and growing out of snch experiments. The resolution was adopted. Senator Farwell asked his colleague to withdraw his motion so as to allow him to introduce a bill to perpétua!« the national bank system. Senator Cullom declined and at 12:20 o'clock the senate adjourned. Th© Mouse. In the house this morning Mills, of Texas, offered a resolotion directing the speaker to appoint a committee on rules, accounts, enrolled bills and mileage, each to consist of the same number of members ns provided for in the rules of the Forty ninth congress, and referring rules of that congress to the committee on rules, when appointed. .Adopted. Cox, of New York, chairman of the com mittee to inform the president of the organization of the house, reported that the committee had performed its doty and that tlfe president would communicate with the house forthwith.

Good For Paper and Reader. Washington special: Congressman McShane called at the postoffice depart ment to-day and had an interview with . , , .. , ,, . ... tlie officials relative to the order proinn iting newspapers from mailing their papers before passing through the post tfffice. He explained that the order was particularly onerous upon the newspa l>ers of Omaha where the early morning mail closes at 4:30, although the train does not leaye until 5:17. He asked that some plan be devised whereby the mails could be weighed at the trains as was formerly done, or that some other plan equally as good be substituted, Mr. McShane was successful in Ms mis ston, and the de r .artmeut order will be so far tnodihed as to permit the pub lishers to weigh their papers in their of tices, and to furnish sworn statements of weight to the imstmaster on which post age shall be paid. This order will prob ably be sent ont immediately. Crisp, of Georgia, who had the most to do in the last congress with the action upoii the bill to extend the indebtedness of the Pacific railroads, and who will probably be the chairman of that com mittee in this congress, snid that the re port und recommendations of the special committee that investigated the affairs of the Pacifies during the past summer would influence whatever legislation congress would likely make at this ses sion. He said that the attorney general had the report of the committee, in hand , with a view to formulating suggestions to congress, and that the report was ex pected to be made public next week. "ff nothing better is recommended," said Mr Crisp. " 1 presume congress xviUtak«! up the bill which the committee report* . ed last winter and pass it." j I I Washington, Dec. 9.—Senator Stanford will introduce a bill in congress at tbe first opportunity to amend the naturalization a)4 4 , ... 4 .. btates can become a citizen until after a residence of twenty-one years in the land of bis adoption.

ATTORNEY GENERAL, An Account ot the Rustuess t'rsn« acted In His Department the 1* »»< Year. Wasiiington, Da.Mk—The »nrnml report of Attorney UencrabOarlatid gives u full ao count of the bu»im •* or the department dur ing the fiscal year. The number of ordinary suits now pending in the court of claims, la 1,110, involving the sum of $1 i,&0,0U). The number of cast* Died under the Bowman act la I,sits Involving about föO.üOJ.OOO. The peti tions tiled ih French spoliation cases num ber 5,5t0, representing Ü.I8U vessels, and about $30,000,000. During the fiscal year 1,777 civil suits were terminated; 9 '£1 Judgments were for the United States, 10J for defendants, 703 dismissed, 30 a ppealed to the circuit court aud 34 to the supreme court. During the year there were 13.9J7 criminal prosecutioni, mostly for violations of customs and inu rnal revenue laws The attorney general cabs attention to suggoa it«msand recommendation* made in hU last annual report in regard to matters calling for remedial legislation and aguih urges the necessity of Immediate action thereon. Thcae subjects are as follows: Fees of marshals in territories, pay of deputy mar shals, revision of fee bill, su!*ultutlon of tlseal tnr calendar year, protection to civil oitlcem and witnesses, fees of wltneses und luroia, eiimiual prtK.*eedure, perjury und laws, and juries In District of Columbia. In regard to the confinement and treatment of United States prisoners, the attorney gen eral says he is more than ever convinced of the absolute need ol u government peniten tiary and reformatory, lie alsoculls attention to the necessity for additional legislation for restoring aud preserving court records, and makes an urgent appeal In behalf of certain changes In the judicial system of the country. He urges an appropriation for the erection, on ground adjacent to the department of justice, of a suitable building for the accommodation of the supreme court and other courts aud commissioners of the United States, asks that congress provide for hirni-hing portraits of the judges of the supreme court io adorn the chambers of that court. Atten tion is also Invited to the necessity of extend ing the jurisdiction of federal courts to crimes committed upon American vessels navigat ing the great 1 ikes. Congress is urged to take some action for ttie settlement of outstanding claims of witmsses and jurors for services duriug and prior to the year LVJ5. The attorney general says that increased ex penses in service of process lias been the ex 1 erlence of the department since tlie passage of the interstate commerce bill. Prior to the passage of that bill marshuls were thruiahed with free transportation over the vurtous lines of railway while in the service of pro ecss. since that date, however, no free trans DortfiMon is furnished, and railways charge a mileage greater than the fett allowed the marshal for his travel in such s rvice. The attorney general, in clos.ng his re port, devotes a chapter to the c m sidération of the French spoliation act. He says: "The difficulty of the quesilons involved suggests the necessity of a vigilant, exhaustive Judicial investiga tion. I therefore recommend the passage of an act amendatory of the act of the noth of January, 1885, which shall confer authority upon the court of claims to render Judgment in the cases provided for by the act, instead of repotting its conclusions to congress is now required to do, and to grant to cither party, the government or claimant, the right of appeal to the supreme court ot the United States from the decision of the court of claire»'* suits tiled under the act of 18S5. It is not probable that cither government or claimant will tind it necessary to resort to appeals in more than a few cases, but as the lew now stands, no appeal can be taken by either party.

The m mount of money annually exacted, through the ojkthUou of lire sent laws, from the Industries ami necessities of the people, largely exceeds the sutn necessary to meet the expenses of the govern meut. When we eousider that the theory of our In stitutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry aud enterprise, with only such deduction may he Ids share toward the careful and ecou otiucul maintenance of the government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction ot more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burdeu ot natioual taxation, like other wrongs* multiplies a brood of evil conse quences. The public treasury, which should only exist as a conduit couve viug the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expendi ture, becomes a hoarding place for inouey ucedlessly withdrawn from trade and the peo lUe's use, thus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, pre venting in vestment in productive enterprises, threateniug financial disturbance - , aud iuv.t ii«g schemes of public plunder. This couditlou of our treasury la not alto gether hew; aud it has more thau once of late beeu submitted to the people's repie-eüt atives iu the congress, who alone cau apply a remedy. Aud yet the situation still coutiuues, with aggravated iucideuts, more than ever i nesaging tiuaucial convuislou und widespread lisaster. It will dot do to neglect this situation be cause its dangers are not uow palpably Immi nent and appareut. They exist none the less certainh aud await the unforseeu and unex pected occasion when suddeuly they will be precipitated upou us. On the 30th day of June, 1SS5, the exeess of revenues over public ex^uditures, after com piling with the aumiui requirements of the sinking fund act, was $17,>50,735.84; during the year ending June 80, 1SSÖ, such excess amounted to $49,405,515**20; aud during the year eudiug June 30, 1837, it reached the sum ot $55,567,849.54. The annual contributions to the sinking fund duriug the three years above .«Decided, amounting in the aggregate to $138,053.3i0.9», and deducted from the surplus as stated, were made by calling in for that purpose outstand ing three per cent Umds of the government. During the six months prior to June 30, 1887, the surplus reveuue had grown so large bv repeated accummulatious, and It was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would the business of the country, that the *79.804,100 of such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the three per cent, bonds still outstanding, and which Were tbeu payable at the option of the government. The precarious condition of fl n neial affairs among the people still ueeding relief, immediately after the 30th dav of June 1887, the remainder of the three per cent, bonds then outstanding, amounting with prin cipal and interest to the sum of $18,377.500, were called lu and applied to the sinking fund contribution for the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these operations of the trejsury department the representations of distress lu Uisluess circles not onlv continued but increased, ami absolute peril seemed at baud. In these circumstances the con tribu tiou to the sinkiDg-fuud Tor the current fiscal year was at once completed by the expendi ture of $*JT,684,*283.55 in the purchase of government bonds uot due bearing per cent, interest, the premium paid thereon av eraging about twetity-four per cent, for the former and eight per cent. f..r the latter. In addition to this the interest accruing during the current year upon the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the government w as to some extent anticipated, and bunks selected as de positories of public money were permitted to somewhat increase their deposits. While the expedients thus employed to re lease to the people the money lying Idle in the treasury, served to avert immediate danger, our surp us revenues have continued to accu mulate, the excess for the Drefent year amounting on the first dar of'Dccetnber to $55,258,7b 1.19, and is > stlmated to sum of $l!3.U <0,0)0 on the 3*Jih of June next, hich date it is expected that this sum. added to prior accumulations will swell the surplus in the treasury to $14*),M0o,0.lU. There seems to be no assurance, that, with such a withdrawal from Use of the people's circulating medium, our business community mav not in ihe near future be subjected to the same distress which was quite iateiv produced fr< m the same cause. And while the functions of our natioual treasury should be few und simple, and while its liest condition would be reached, I believe, by its entire disconnection with prirate business Interests, yet, when, by on of its purposes, it idly holds mon ey uselessly subtracted from the ch American fairness und a tfoct h the at a perv nets of trade. It.ere seems to be reason for the claim that some legitimate means should t)e devise 1 by the government to restore in un emergency, without waste or extravagance, such money to Its place among tlie people. If such an emergency arises, there now ex ists no clear aud undoubted executive power of relief. Heretofore tlie redemption of 3 per cent, bonds which were parable at the option of tlie government, ha* afforded a means for the disbursement of the excess of our reven ues; hut these bonds have »II been retired, and there are bonds outstanding, the pav nient of which we have the right lo Insist up on. The contribution to the sinking fund, which furnishes tlie occas'on for expenditure In the purchase of hoods, has lieeu already made for the current year, so that there ,a outlet iu that direction. In the present state of legislation, the only pretense of anv existing executive power to restore, at this time, any part of our surplus revenues to the people by IU expenditure, consists In the siip[H>slllon that the secretary of the treasury may enter the market and pur chase the bond* of the government not yet due nt a rate of premium to he agreed ut*on. The only provision of law from which such a power could Ip derived is found In the ap propriation bill passed a number of year* ngo, and It Is subject to the suspicion that It Intended as temporary and limited In its ap plication, instead of conferring a continuing discretion and authoritv. No condition ought to exist which would Justify the grant of power to a single r.fli. I..1, upon his Judgment of Its necessity, to with hold from or release to the business of the unusual manner, money held in the treasury, anil thus affect, at his will, the financial situation of the country; and If It Is deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of tbe treasury the authority In the present juncture to purchase bonds, it should be plair.lv vested, ami provided as far as possible, with such checks and limitations as will define this offi cial's right and discretion, and at the same time relieve him from undue responsibility. In considering the question of purchasing bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus money accumulating In the treas ury, It should be horn In mind that premiums muât be paid on a large part of these bonds held as Investments which cannot be pur chased at any price, and that combinations among holders who ure willing to sell, mav unreasonably enchance tbe cost of such bonds to the government. It has been suggested that, the present bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate of Interest, and the difference between the old and new security paid In cash, thus find ing use for the surplus in the treasury. The success of this plan, it la apparent, must de pend upon the volition of t present bonds; and It Is not entirely certain that the inducement which must bn offered them would result in more financial benefit to the government thau the purchase of Ixmds, while the latter proposition would re-luce tbe principal Of the debt by actual payment, In stead of extending it. The proposition to deposit tbe money held by the government in banks throughout the country, for use bv the people, Is, H seems to me. exceedingly objectionable In principle, ns rstabllsl.lu g Pa.close h relationship between the operations of the government treasury and tbe business of the country, and Pm extensive a commingling of lliclr money, thus foslerlug an ....natural reliance In private business upon oublie funds. If lliis scheme should be adopted it should onlv be done »»a temporary expedient to meet an urgent necessity.
