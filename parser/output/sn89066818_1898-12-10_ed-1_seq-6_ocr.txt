Tim President Haa Only Word of Praise for Those Who Brought the War to m ttnceesiiful Conclusion, and Looks For ward Conflently to the Conclusion of tin Houorable Treat of Peace with bpain. Washington, Dec. 5. President mc Kinlcy's second animal message, sub mitted to congress, contains about 20, 000 words. Following is a brief synop sis including some direct excerpts qf the more important features of the message: TO THE 

SENATK AND HOUSE OF REPJtKSHNATlVKS: Nothwithsianding the aude burdens rendered necessary by tliw war, cur peojile rejoice in a very sat isfactory and steadily-Increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of usiness ever recorded. Manu factures have been productive, agricul tural pursuits have yieuK.nl abundant re turns, labor In all lieius of Industry is betlcr rewarded. revenue legislation passed by the present congress has in creased the treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors; the linnnccs ot the government have been suc cessfully administered and its credit ad vanced to the lirst rank; while its cur rency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a oiiimon ilarf and for a riRlileous cause has strengthened tne nathiial spirit, and fcervt-d lo cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every sec tion of the country. 

CONTUOVEKSY WITH SPAIN RE VIEWED. In reviewing the controversy which led up to the war with Spain, the president tidies up the thread or narrative where it terminated in his last annual mes sage, lie concluded: "It was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she t-tiouio: be given a reasonable :;: nee to realize her exiiectations of re form to which she had become irrevoca bly committed." il became evident, however, that the proposed plans were barren of Kood re sults. No tangible relief was afforded tne rceoiicentrados. among whom the rate of mortality frightfully increased: the proli'ered expedient of zones of cultiva tion proved illusory, and it was apparent that no! lung save the physical exhaus tion of Spain or the t'ubans and the jirac lictil ruin of the island of Cuba could re sult from the struggle then in progress. DHSTitl't'TION OF THE 

MAINE. At this critical juncture the destruc tion of the battleship "Maine" occurred. Concerning it the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense i-.siinguishing our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, al ready deeply touched y preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an in stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition ot danger and disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed, by whomso ever wrought." itct unung the war narrative, the presi dent directs attention to the measures, he luding the S.,oi)'J,0oa appropriation for ILMiftial defensM, taken to piare the cooutry on a war footing, and adds: "it is s.u:!:eiciit to say that the outbreak of war, when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conilict." Al'i'KEIlENSlON BY 

EL'KOI'EAN POWERS. Ifcfcrrnce is made to the apprehension il coming strife by the continental pow ers, voiced in the address to the presi dent through their ambassadors ami en oys, and to the president's reply thereto. Sntl animated, however, by the hope of a K-aceiul solution of the ililliculty, and ob'- ing the dictates of duty, tile presi de:il relaxed no effort to bring about a sp n-dy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne Kotiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical results wore concerned, and then it was the president presented the question to enn Kteys. saying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests, which Rive us the right and duty to speak and to ad. the war in I'ubumnst stop." T'li: 

IKCEA RATION OK CONGRESS. 'i lie result of this statement of the case was ne adoption of the memorable joint resolution hy congress, declaring the pur pose of the Cniied States to intervene bet woi n the Spaniards and Cuban. Fol lowing sv.it'tly upon the enactment of the rciuilulion. came the severence of diplo matic relations between the two coun-1rit-s. the proclamation of a blockade of Cuhan ports, the call for volunteers, ami Ihe formal declaration of the existence ot a state of w.ir. All other governments were immediately notilied of the exist ei.ee of war and each proclaimed neu tiaiity. "1 is not among the least grati fying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged hy all, often under delicate anil dillicult circumstances." THE PREPARATION FOR WAR. The president reviews at length the work of preparation for war, referring Particularly to the enlistment of the vol unteers, to the material increase of the navy in both men and ships, and to the prmautionary measures taken for the pro;nlion of the seaboard coast and ciiics. "The aggregate number of mines placed was l.rji. at the principal harbors !:o?n Maine to California." Itefcrrlng to "the diiTicult and Im pel i.'.nl character" of the- work per for ii - d bv the signnl corps the president i :. "This service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operations of t::-.- :irmy and navy. With a total force of iver 1.3'H. the loss was by disease, in c-iTinn and field, officers and men included, nntv live." As to the authorized loan of $2M.non.non, winch was t:ik"u entirely by small bid t! i... tie president says: "This was a i;'e:. encotiragim; and significant result, showing the vast resources of the nation j;n I ;he determination of the people to uphold their country's honor." T. iking up chronologically the events of the war, the president reviews them care fully. T'ie tirst encounter was the shell ing of Matanzas on April 27. This was fo lowed by an engagement which was "IV'N.ir.ed to mark a memorable epoch in lu.'Mitini" warfare." i;'lVKV'S WONPERFn. 

VICTORY. Tins wr.s Commodore Pewey's wonder ful victory at Manila, on May 1. "The ef fect of this remarkable victory" says the prcJicciit. "upon the spirit of our "people and upon the fortunes of the war was in t int. A prestige of invincibility thereby .ttaihed to our arms, which continued throughout the struggle." The president says that "Only reluc-tam-e to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming and capture of the city (Manila), and therewith the absolute military occupan cy of the whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleship Oregon from San Francisco to Key West, and the bombardment of San Juan and the forts of Santiago, to which special reference Is made, the president says: 

LIEUT. HOESON S EXPLOIT. "The next act In the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven volunteers, blocked the outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking thi roiiier Merrlmac In the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap ing with their lives as by a miracle, but falling Into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a most gratifying Incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of he roes was cordially appreciated by the Sintnlsh admiral." THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN. The campaign of Santiago, resulting In the Investment and capture ot that city, is referred to as a brilliant achieve ment. A brief review is then presented of the decisive naval combat of the war on July 3. resulting in the complete de struction of Admiral Crevera'a fleet. Con cerning it the president says: "Where all so conspicuously distinguished them elvea, from the commanders to the (jun and th unnamed heroes In the boiler rooms, each and all contributing towards the achievement of this astound ing victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event, and the mar velous disproportion of casualties, it woulu be invidious to single out any one for special honor." 

PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS. In this connection the president says: 'Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve ments of our builders, mechanics and- ar tisans for their part in the construction of our warships." TEAI'.S FOR THE DEAD. As to the success gained by the arms of the United States in Cuba, the presi dent says that the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. "Nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living, the dead claim our tears, and our losses by battle, and disease must cloud any exultation at the result, and teach us tho awful cost of war, however, rightful the cause or signal the victory." 

CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. "The total casualties in killed and wounded in the army during the war with Spain were: Officers killed, 21: en listed men killed. 257: total. 2su: officers ! wounded, 113; enlisted men wounded, 1 - 4tU: total 1.5.7. Of the navy: Killed, li; wounded, T7; died as result of wounds, 1; invalided from service. 6; total, M. "it will be observed that while our navy was engaged in two great battles and in numerous perilous undertakings in block ade and bombardment, and more than uii.imO of our troops were transported to distant lands, and were engaged in as sault and siege and battle and manv skirmishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of I.:iiS killed :ind wounded: and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun. "r a tlag, or a transport, or a ship, and with the exception of the crew of the "Merrim;:e" not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner." trii:i:te to those who could not t;o. The president bears testimony and pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de votion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortcnate- iv were nox rei;uirei ouisiue in me i iim-u States." They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The president then says: "In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment, and offers humble prayer for the continuance of tus favors." THE 

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. The peace negotialons. which followed soon alter the capitulation of Santiago, and the preparation and signing of the protocol, are discussed at length. Refer ring to the work of the peace commis sioners at Paris, the president says: "These negot iations liav made hojieful progress, so that 1 trust soon to be able to lay a definite treaty before the senate, with a review u the steps leading to its signature." 

GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS SESSIONS. "I do not discuss at this time the gov ernment or tenure of the new possesions which will come to us as a result of tne war with Spain. Such discussion vill he appropriate after the treaty of peace shall le ratified. In the meantime, and until the congress has legislated other wise. It will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation, and lo give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and benefi cent rule. THE FUTURE OF CUBA. "As soon as W3 are in possession of Cuba and have paeitied the island it will be necessary to g-ve aid and direction to its pt-uple to form a government for them selves. This sliould be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assure i success. It is im portant that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commer cial lelations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the industry of the people, and assist them to form a government which shall be free and in dependent, thus realizing the best aspira tions of the Cuban people. A HUMANE GOVERNMENT. "Spanish rule must lie replaced by a just, benevolent and humane govern ment, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and pro mote peace and good will among ail of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither re venge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued." FRIENDLY WITH ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. The provident says that with one ex ception cf the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the I'nited Stales with the great family of nations during the past year has been marked with cordiali ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar gentine f. overnment. initiated with a view to remoiing differences in cable rate charges imposed upon messages passing from and to the United States, the presi dent expresses his sincere hope for an in ternational agreement whereby Inter change of messages over connecting lines may be regulated on a fair basis of uni formity, and adds: "It would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which owes 39 much cf its progress to the an nihilation of time by the electrical force, de-man Js that this all-important means of communication lie a heritage of all ieo ples, to be administered and regulated in their common behalf." A 

QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. As to the killing and wounJinsr of strik ing miners in Luzerne county. Pa., which aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun-garian government, many of the miners being subjects of that government, the president expects to reach a haruonlous understanding on the subject with Austria-Hungary. The hope is expressed that the restric tions imposed by lielgium on the impor tation of American cattle will at an early day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer ican cattle under proper regulations. THE 

NICARAGUA CANAL. The president expects that the Nicara gua canal commission will shortly be able lo report liuaily. "1 have not hesitated to express my convictions." says the pres ident, "that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an inter oceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of tbe status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter." The president regards, in view of our r.ewly-acquired interests in the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a mari time highway as now more man ever in dispensable. 

EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Concerning the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese empire, the president says that our position among nations gives the equitable claim to con sideration and friendly treatment in this regard, and that it will be his aim to subserve our large interests in the orient by all means appropriate to th e constant policy of our government. Reference Is made to several claims of citizens of the United States pending against other nations and to the settle ment of other claims during the past year. THE 

PARIS EXPOSITION.

OUR RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRIT AIN. Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly footing, and the president says ir would give htm especial satisfaction if he should be au thorized to communicate to congress a favorable conclusion of the pending nego tiations with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. The president reports that the Hawaiian commission has fulfilled its mission, and that its report will be laid before congress at an early day. "It was believed that their recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the magni tude of responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the relationship of thus mid-Pacific lands to our home ua- j ion as will benefit bota n the Mghest : greee." i . THE 

CZAR'S PEACE PROPOSAL. Referring to the proposal of the czar of Russia for a general reduction of the I great military establishments, the presi j dent says: "His majesty was at once in formed of the cordial sympathy involved j Ir his exalted proposal, and of the readi ness of the united states to t&ite part in the conference." The president says that the newly-accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman porte carries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in con troversy with Turkey for a number of years. 

FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. Alluding to the financial affairs of the country, the president says in part: "The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended Juno 3. lrt"S, including J'rl. 751.223 received from sale of Pacilic railroads, amounted to J405.3ai,33i, and its expenditures to H 13, 4GS.5M!. "It is estimated upon the basis of pres ent revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June oO. 1V.I9, will be f77,S74.W.". and its exiiendi tures $'IM74.047, resulting in a deliciency of fn;,iNio,iii. "In my judgment, the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the im mediate enactment of the legislation rec ommended one year ago. under which a portion of the gold Moldings should be placed in a trust fund, from which green backs should be redeemd upon presenta tion, but 'vhen once redeemed should not therenfti. be paid out except for gold. It is not to lie inferred that other legis lation relating to our currency is not re quired: on the contrary, there is an ob vious demand for It." 

OOMMUN1CATION WITH ACQUIRED ISLANDS. Tho president says that in view of th recent acquisition of territory hy th I'nited States, there should be estahlishen regular and frequent steamship communi cation, under the American Hag, with lh newly-acquired islands.

The principal training has been in the line of cons; defense. The report then states: "The experience of this short war has clearly demonstrated the impera tive necessity for the maintenance of a national lcserve, in the organiza tion of which too much reliance must not be placed upon the merchant ma rine alone." low r-.iev Shnnlil be Knrolleil. Lieut.
