INDIANAPOLIS, DNCLE SAM WILL RETALIATE President Harrison About to Enforce a Provision of the Xew Tariff Law. Discriminating Duties toBoriaced on Articles Imported from Countries That Have Kot Jfecotiated Reciprocity Treaties. China, Japan, Hawaii and Argentina Will He tneMost Seriously Affected. Proclamation to De Issued on the 1st of Jan nary France and Germany Will Try to Secure a Uepeal of the Sugar Bounty. 

RETALIATORY DUTIES. Important Section of the Reciprocity Clanse of tho Tariff Law About to lie Enforced. Fpeclal to the Indianapolis Journal. - Washington. Dec. 14. President Har rison is about to take a most important step in the commercial dealings of this countiy with others, and the first public announcement of the step will be made in this dispatch. It is nothing short of a proclamation now being prepared. ' prac tically placing an embargo against all countries which have not made reciprocity treaties with the United States under the provisions of the McKinley act. The proclamation will be issued on the 1st day of January nest, which is less than threo weeks oil. It will attach retaliatory duties upon sugar, molasses, coffee and tea im ported from thoso countries which have failed to take advantage of the reciprocity clause. This proclamation will be of more impor tance in its commercial eifoct than the ne gotiating of a dozen treaties, for it affects many countries, and practically clcses our custom-houses against the chief articles of export of several nations. The reciprocity section which empowers the President to make this proclamation, is as follows: "With a view to secure reciprocal trade with countries producing tbe following ar ticles, and for this purpose, on and after the let day of January, lfcltt, whenever and so often as the President shall be natislied that the government of any country pro ducing and exporting sugars, molanses. cof fee, tea and hides, raw and uncured, or any of such articles, imposes duties or other ox actions upon the agricultural or other products of the United States which, in view of the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides into the United States ho may deem to be recip rocally unusual and unreasonable, he shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend, by proclamation to that effect, the provisions of this act relating to the free introduction of such sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and hides, tbe production of such country, forstich time as he shall deem just, and in such case, and during such suspen sion, duties shall be levied, collected and Eaid upon sugar, molasses, coffee, tea and ides, the product of, or exported from such designated country, as follows:" The act then spccities the discriminatory duties which may bo imposed. These aro seven-tenths of 1 cent per pound on sugars not above No. 13 Dutch standard, and ISi cent per pound on sugars abovo No. 13 Dutch standard. On xcoiTee the discrim inatory duty is S cents refpound; on tea, 10 cents per pound, and on all kinds of hides, 1H cent per pound. Tho proclamation will bo mainly impor tant in its effect on the great tea imports of China and Japan, the enormous hide prod ucts of the Argentine Kepublio, and tbe sugar and coffee products of Uruguay, Par asuay and several minor southern coun tries. China and Japan might have secured a remission of thislO cents per pound duty on tea, but they have failed to take advantage of tho reciprocity clause, and th proclama tion will be specially directed against them. The Argentine Republic is the great ex porter of hides to this country. The a'ver age valno of importations is seldom short of $4,000,000. Other countries which will sutler by the proclamation are llayti and the Hawaiian islands, with their groat sugar products, and the Danish, Dutch and French colonies to the eouth of this coun try. The proclamation will also be important in securing to tho countries which have embraced reciprocity tho full advantage of the United States maikots in sugar, tea. coffeo and hides. Tho countries which have thus far accepted reciprocity or are now negotiating treaties to that end are Brazil. Santo DoiniDgo, Costa Kica, Brit ish Colombia. Porto Kico, British Guiana, Guatemala, Colombia, British Honduras, Venezuela, Kquador. Peru, Mexico, British West Indies and Nicaragua. Aside from the commercial importance of this proclamation, it will popularly be ac cepted as offsetting the recent criticism directed at the President's message be cause it wholly failed to mention reci procity. This has been widely construed as an effort on the part of Mr. Harrison to ignore Secretary Blaine's reciprocity plan. It appears, however, that tho President fully asrees with Mr. lilaino on tho importance- of a reciprocity prozramme; so much so that he desires to treat it specially in the proclamation of Jan. 1 rather than cover it up m a general message. 

SCHEME OF FOKEIGNEUS. "Will Endeavor to Secure the Xtepeal of the Sngar Bounty Clause of the McKinley Law. Fr-al to tho Indianapolis Journal Washington, Dec. 14. It has leaked out that a quiet but determined effort will be made this winter by tho diplomatic repre sentatives of Germany and France to se cure tho repeal of tbe bounty upon beet sngar granted by tbe last Congress. Both of there countries, which are largo export ers of this product, producing each year more than sutlicient to supply the needs ot their people, have been seriously hurt by the prospect that witbin a few years the United States will produce from the beet an amount not only sufficient for domestio consumption, but euilicient to enter into competition with the markets of the world. Under the provisions of the Mc Kinley law the President has been enabled, under the threat of excluding beet sugar, to secure reciprocal trade relations with Germany and a partial removal of the re strictions upon tho entrance of our meat products into France. Tho object of both of these nations is now to so use the feehng against bounties as to secure tbe with drawal of the club which is now held over their heads, and it will not be surprising if. within a very short time, a vigorous and determined attack is made by th Dem ocratic Congress npon tbe sugar-bounty clause of the McKinley law. 9500 Fine for Accepting a Free Pass.

WAYLAID BIS RIVAL. Angnst Ratcliffe's Girl Went Home with An other, and a Deadly Fight Results. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. Nkw Albany, Ind., Dec. 14. Last Satur day night an entertainment was held at Wolfe's school-house, in Washington coun ty, thirty miles northwest of this city, and at its close Angnst Katclitle re quested the privilege of accom panying Miss Minnie Henninger home. Tho young woman refused, prefer ring the company of Homer Deavenish. While the young couple were en route to Miss Henningcr's home, they were stopped by IJatclifft who attacked Deavenish with t "slung-shot," knocking him down and injuring him severely. Though dazed and almost unconscious, Deavenish drew a re volver and tired two shots at his assailant, shooting him throuah tbo neck aud chest. The screams of Miss Henninger brought assistance, and tbo two injured men wcie carried homo. Katcliffe lingered nntil last night, when ho died. At the announce ment of his d?ath his friends threatened to lynch his murderer, and to prevent this Deavenish was to-day taken to Salem and lodged in jail. An examination of Deavcn ish's wounds reyealed a fracture of the skull, and his life is de spaired of. The young woman who was the only eye witness to the tragedy is dangerously ill of brain fever and it is feared she will lose her reason. Pnblio sentiment sides with Deavenish and it is believed he can establish bis case of self defense, that is if he be lucky enough to recover from his injuries. IDENTIFIED BY HIS TEETH No Longer Any Doubt tbat tbe Boston Note-Broker Was tbe Bomb-ThroAven Fillines In the Teeth of the Preserved Head xamined and Foqud to Co as Described by tbe Dentist Who Attended Nor cross. New Yohk, Dec. 14. Coroner Messemer has been reported as having announced that there Were no fillings in the teeth of the dead dynamiter, -whoso bead is at the morgue. Inspector Byrnes hesitates to acknowledge tho Boston identification of the dead crank as Henry L.Norcross, and his utterances, taken with Messemer'a alleged denial of dental lilllngs in the head, tend to create belief that the officials are dis gruntled and jealous of the reporters, who outstripped the officials and identified tho dead head. A Boston dentist who attend ed to the teeth of Norcross has stated that there were fillings in them. Thus tbe mat ter stood when to-day opened, and tb;a is what has happened since. A dispatch has come to tbe Associated Press from Boston thus: 'If it is a fact, as reported, that Coroner Messemer has made an examination of the teeth of tbe dead dynamiter and found no filling in them, then it would seem that the head cannot be that of Henry L. Norcross, as Norcross had fillings in nino of his teeth, six in the upper and three. -in .the, .lower jaw. Dr. Edward Cogglns, who has been Henry Nor cross's dentist for ten years, says: Mf the teeth in the dead man's head in the New York morgue reveal no signs of filling, then it cannot be tbat of Norcross, as I will prove to yoa from my books, in which I have the record of nine lillings I inserted for him.' Dr. Coggins produced a diagram of a complete set ot teeth, npon which he marked from his books the exact fillings he had put in for Norcross." Later in the day an examination of the bomb-thrower's head was made by Dr. Ed ward Duubam. and was confined to his teeth and jaws. The result contradicts Me&smer's alleged statement, and confirms the Boston dentist. There are nine fillings iu tbe teeth. The last wisdom tooth on the right upper jaw is missing. There was a de pression where it had been. The two upper molars were tilled with gold, also the sec ond bicuspid on the same side. A small pieco of the surface of the left caniue tooth on tbe upper jaw was broken off, leaving a 6light depression, which may have been caused by the explosion. The second bicus pid of the lett upper jaw was filled with gold, also tho first nnd second molars on the same side. The teeth were all in position in the lower jaw. Tho lirst molar of the right lower jaw was tilled with gold. The second molar was very black. There was a black spot in tho middle of the crown of the third molar on tbe lower right jaw. Tho doctor was unable to. determine whether this was a rilling or decay. All the teeth were in position on the loft lower jaw. According to statements made by inti mate Boston friends of Norcross. there is substantial evidence tbat the hitter's brain had been affected by his excessive use of drugs, which he claimed had a great orlect in keeping a man In excellent physical con dition. Camphor, alum and sulphur ho used regularly, say these gentle men. Norcross used to say that camphor. owing to its penetrating qualities, was a most efficacious prevent ive of disease. He kept it in a small bottle, and taking it, he would remove the cork, wet the end of the finger, then re move the liquid with his tongue, repeat ing this process several times. When re monstrated with for using so much cam phor internally, he would reply tbat it was the only way to prevent disease. Coroner Messemer made public to-day the results of his examination of the brain and cerebal matter of the dynamiter. In his opinion there is not a shadow of doubt tbat the bomb-thrower was the victim of a continued mania which had lasted for several years. The man's brain was found to weigh 1,210 grammes, or three ounces abovo the aver age. Dime museum managers are making strenuous efforts to secure the head for ex hibition, but Coroner Messemer refuses to deal with them. The father and mother of Henry I Nor cross, of Boston, arrived in this city late to-night They will undoubtedly visit the morgue to-morrow to examine tbe head which is believed to be that of their son. Itlddled the Ileds Instead of the Negroes. Savannah, Oa., Dec 14. At 2:30 o'clock yesterday morning a mob of masked men broke into the iail at Waycrcss. for the purpose of lynching Welcome Golding. the leader of a riot at Varus's saw-mill, in which a white man was killed. Thy also wanted Elijah Cheaves, a negro, charged vrith the murder of Sheriff' Culpepper, of Ware countv. The prisoners heard them corn in sr. and clung to the sides of their cells, and mado no reply to questions put to them by tho mob. The would-be lynch ers must have had no liiihts, for they rid dled the empty beds of tho prisoners with bullets, and left, thinking they had killed their men. Tho prisoners, who were still clinging to the sides of the cage, escaped unhurt. Losses by Fire. Joliht, 111., Dec. 14. The extensive plant of the Watkins Wire-spring Com pany in Lockport burned this morning, causing a loss of 80,000. The company is the successor of the Chicago Wire and Spring Company, in operation f since last April. It worked seventy-five men mak ing barb wire. It was outside- the Colum bia patent combine. Oake, N. D.. Dec. 14. Fire here last night caused a loss of 30,000 and resulted in thedeath of one man. The flamesbroke out at midnight in the store and office of Dr. Schmidt Nelson, and he was burned to death before help could reach him. ON THE YERGE OF STARVATION Indiana's Striking Coal Miners Reported to lie in Seed of Money to Bny Food, Many F&milies in Clay County Subsisting on One Meal a Day, with Little Prospect of Do ing Better Unless the Straggle Is Ended.

MEAL A DAT FOR STRIKERS. Situation In the Coal Region Growing: Worse and Worse with the Rising or Every Sun. Brazil, lnd., Dec. 14. The situation in bituminous coal regions in Indiana, in which some twenty thousand miners , are on strike, is a gloomy one for the strikers and its outcome may bring the wolf to the door of many a dolver in the bowels of the earth in adjacent States. The Indiana strike is one of desperation, accord ing to tho stories of the old-time men, and certainly the outlook is one of picblng hunger, if not actual starvation, cold and nakedness. The mine operators say that the present strike is in violation of an agreement mado by the men last spring not to ask for an advance in wages for one year, and that, in view of that fact, they -will not negotiate with the strikers. Tho latter say that the mine owners took advantage of them in the spring, when they wore not prepared for a strike, to force them into signing an uojnst scale, and tbat in refusing to keep that contract any longer than necessary they are no moro blamable than they would he to turn upon a highway robber whenever opportunity offered. Tney declare tbat the miners of Indianahavebeenmoro oppressed and ground down than those of any other State in the Union; tbat their wases have been less; that they have been subjected to all sorts of oppression; that their oondition was little better than that of Russian con victs in Siberian mines, and that tbey struck for more decent treatment in sheer desperation, preferring starvation to fur ther submission. Though their committeemen aro trying to hide the fact, it is nevertheless true that many of the men and their families are already on the verge of starvation, subsist ing on one meal a day, and have been do ing s' for two weeks. The relief received thus far has been very scant, aud in some places the strikers are totally without fuel, the mine-owners having undertaken to freeze men out by refusing even to sell them coal. In tho face of all this, how ever, tbe men talk with an air of grim determination to tight it out to the death, if needs be. . There is hope, however, that this will not become necessary, as the na tional executive board of tbe Coal-miners' Association of the United States has at last recognized the strike and approved it. aud has issued a call to all of its members to contribute to therelief of tho strikers. This broadens thy scope of the tight. It has been stated that mine-owers in adjoining States have been supplying contracts for the In diana mino-owners. This will be investi gated by the board, and if it cannot be checked in any other way tho miners in those States will be called out, also. Situation at Crested Dutte. Crested Butte, Col., Dec. 14. The com mittee appointed by the miners met with a committeo from the operators to-day, and a proDOsition was made to arbitrate the dif ferences now existing. The operators pos itively refused to compromise the matter, and declared that tho men would return to work at the cut rate of Co cents a ton or not at nil. The miners are almost penniless, aud if they do not get to work soon their families will be in actual want. The men declare that tbey will starve before tbey will accept the reduction, and will fight nntil death before they will allow black legs to be brought in to take their places. Sherilf Shares to-night declared that the sitnation is growing more serious every ciay. 

FEDERATION OF LABOR. Eleventh Annual Convention of the Great La bor Organization Sir. Gotu pern's Address. Birmingham. Ala., Dec. 14. The eleventh annual convention of the Federation of Labor convened at Erswell Hall, in this city, at 10 o'clock this morning, being called to order by President Samuel Gom pers. It was.be said, in course of his address, the largest convention ot the federation in its history. The growth of tbo organiza tion during the past year had been phe nomenal, and tbe delegates before him rep resented more than three-quarters of a million of organized labor. Much had been accomplished in tho past, bat much more still remained to be done in the future. He gave a hearty welcome to the dele gates, and urged them to return to their different organizations determined to push onward and upward for the im provement of labor. Continuing, he said: "It should bo our eilort to make each succeeding convention of tho Ameri can Federation of Labor an improvement on tho preceding one, both in numbers and intelligence, keeping pace with the ever increasing intelligence and pressing demands of tbe masses and the develop ment of the industries of our country. On every band wo find organization and com bination on tbe part of those who own or control wealth, and using their possess ions to cruh out the liberties, to -title the voice, to pervert the rights of the toiling masses. While it is true that many attemptshave been made to grapple with this condition of ailatrs, puny and fntile have been the results. These combinations can only bo success fully coped with by a compact and thorough organization of the wago-working class ot our country. Tbe whole cause of humanity appeals to us to bo true to tbo mission of our class, end help in the never-ending contests for reform, justice and right. The perpetuity of the institu tions of onr country, the freedom of the citizen and the man. the burdens npon the shoulders of our sisters, tho cry of the young and innocent children for re lief demand us to do all in onr power, to exert every ollort we aro capable of to bring about a condition of a 11 airs more rational and humane, and relieve us from tho stigma of careless indillerence to these great wrongs by which wo aro sur rounded." At tho conclusion of tho president's ad dress the convention went into executive session and tho doors wero closeti. The usual committees were appointed. General Secretary Chris Evans then pre sented bis annual financial report In do ing so. he said: "The work of the past year has developed many things that will eervo to educate aud help to formulate legisla tion for the wage-earners. That mistakes have been made no one will question, but in the d'senssions that will arise during the proceedings of our annual gathering let our motto be legislation lor tho relief of the masses as against the selfish greed of the few; let the knowledge we have gained by experience act as a guide for us in the future, to avoid, as much as possible, a repetition of the errors of the past. The trades-union movement is doing a noble work in the lino of reform. We are not making as rapid progress as we should. We are reducing the misery and degrada- I tion of tbe wage-earning class, however. the statement to the contrary notwith standing. Let ns move onward. Press our claim forjustice to the wealth-producers and follow the lines marked out by the trades-unions aUiliated with the American Federation of Labor, and success is ours." The report proceeded to state that during the year ending Oct. SI. 1891. 24o charters had been issued to unions in thirty States, amongthem eighteen in Illinois and twenty six in Indiana. Charters havo also been granted to ten national unions, making a total of 2.V during the year. The financial exhibit showed that the receipts of the year had been $:21,346, and that tbe total ex penditures had been S13.1W, leaving a bal ance of $8,156. Of the total expenditures nearly f 2,500 represented loans and dona tions to organizations on strike. Tbo state ment of expenditures was rendered notable by the item showing that the total outlay for salaries on account of an organization with hundreds of branches and a member ship of three-quarters of a million was but the paltry sum of 4,000. At Holly Springs, Miss., yesterday, the Chicago delegation stopped over to chango railroads for Birmingham. Kichard Itrauu sing, delegate of the furniture-workers of Chicago, bears a close resemblance in faco and form to John L. Sullivan, for whom there eeerns to be a warrant in that State. Tho local authorities made a mistake and arrested Braunsing for Sullivan. Tbo en tire population turned out to the court house to view tho noted pacihst, and it took him three hours to explain. Every apology was made when the mistake was discovered. In regard to the Council of Federated Trades of the 1'acitic coast the committee on credentials referred tho question of admitting delegates di rectly to the convention - itself. The San Francisco case is tbe most impor tant question likely to come before tho convention, with the possible exception of tbe boycott. Delegate Carter did not wish to oppose the seating of tho San Francisco delegates, but he questioned the wisdom of such action. They should be careful lest they encourage insubordina tion. They should not let sympathy lead them astray. Delegate Valentine, of San Francisco, believed that if any local union was guilty of insubordination it should be suspended. ' The San Francisco federation had been suspended for not pay ing an assessment, not on account of tbe money involved, but because they knew it to be unjust Money was no ob ject in the matter. Deleeate Jones moved that a special committee of live bo appointed to consider the San Francisco case, and after prolonged discussion the resolution was adopted. The President appointed Blackmore. My ron. Smead, Faulkner and Shields as the committee, with instructions to report to morrow morning. Thelinal action of the convention is in great doubt, the chances seeming to favor a compromise.

CHINA TTILI. NOT TAKE PART. Tbe World's Fair to Ite Ignored by Citizen or the Flower Kingdom, Special to the Indiana;)!! Journal Washington. Dec 14. China will tako no part in the world's fair. O nici.il infor mation has been received at the State Do partment to this eflect It is the result of a long negotiation in which it was hoped that the empire might be persuaded to tako a generous part in the world's fair. A final conference was recently held between Mr, Hitchcock, representing the exposition, ami the Chinese authorities. Minister Denby was present at the conference, and it was through him that the State Department! learned, last Saturday, of the final con clusion of the Chinese authorities. Tho grounds of declination are that the United State has discriminated against citizons of the empire by restrict ing their entranco into this country. Tho position of the Emperor was clearly defined, during the conference. He could not boo why his subjects were good enough to come to the Columbian exposition, and jefc were not good enough to be admitted to tho United States at other times. At the pres ent time the Chinese could not come to tho exposition without a special act of Con gress, and China docs not want to be put ia the humiliating attitude of needing a spe cial passport The Chinese authorities say they will allow Chinese xnerohants al ready in tho conntry to participate in thcr exposition, but as a country they will take no part whatever in the fair.

COMMITTEES. Chairmen Selected by the Republicans reft fer I'luced, but Kyle Lft to the Democrats. Special to tho IodlanapoUs Journal. Washington, Dec 14. President Harri son will be enabled to send in his nomina tions after to-morrow morning, unless tho Senate strikes a snag confirming there-arrangement of committees. The reason there) has been no new nominations sent to tho Scnato during the present session is that the committees havo been reorganized. Sev eral of them, notably the committee on judiciary, which have no head, aro to re ceive the greatest number of nomi nations. There have been a lot of nominations mado during the receta of Congress sent to tho Senate, but they do not require immediate action, for tho o Ul cers are all discharging their dnties. This morning in caucus, the Kepublican Sens tors agreed upon the reorganization of all the committees, naming chainm-n for a number of the most important ones, end as soon as the Democratic Senators report tho minority members, the rearrangement will be formally announced and confirmed in the open benate. That will probably bo among the very first things done to-morrow when the Senate convenes. A largo num ber of appointments will then be made. The chairmen of the committees, as ar ranged, are as follows: Aldricb, on rules; Allen, relations with Canada (select); Allj son, appropriations; Cameron, naval atlairs; Carey, education and labor; Casey, railroads; Chandler, immigra tion; Cullom, interstate commerce; Davis, pensions: Dawes. Indian a Hairs.; Dixon, patents; Dolph, coastdefenses; Fry, commerce; Galliuger. manufacturers; Halo, census; Hawley, military atlairs: Higgins. manufactures; Hiscock, organization, con duct aud expenditures in tbe executive de partments; Hoar, judiciary; Jones of Nevada, to audit and control contingent expenses of the Senate; McMillln, District of Columbia; Manderson. printing; Mitchell, claims; Morrill. finance; Paddock, acrriculture and forestry; Petti grew, quadro-centcnnial; Piatt, territories; Plumb, public lands; Powers, to examine the several branches of the civil service; Proctor, to establish the University of tho United States (ficlect); Qoar, library; Sand ders, enrolled bills; bawycr, postofiice aud post-roads; Sherman, foreign relation, chairman; fehoup. Indian depredatious (se lect); Squire, transportation roulos to tho eea-board; Stanford, public buildings and grounds; Stewart, mines aud mining; Stock bridge, fisheries: Teller.' privilege aud elections; Warren, irrigation; Waithburu, improvement of tho Mississippi river; Wil son, revision of the laws; 'Woicott, civil service and retrenchment. The Senators from tho Northwestern States have been well taken care of in the matter of chairmansMps and places on im portant committees. While Messrs. Feltou, Dubois and Hamsbrongh do not eecnra chairmanship, they do get assignments to committees that originate a largo fart of the important legislation of Coucrefcs. Tbe name of Senator Kyle docs not appear upon, the list, although Senator Pellcr, his Alli ance colleague, is given four committee alignments claims, to examine several branches of tho civil service, tho census, improvement of tho Mississippi river aud its tributaries. It is learned tbat Senator Kyle was approached with a view to ascer- . taming his preferences, but that hi re- pponse was non-committal, and vaguely hinted at an expectation that the Alliance) Senators would receive committee assign ments from both the Kepublican and Dem ocratic caucuses. Doubt has also been cat upon his soundness in Kepublican princi ples, so that, np to this time, tbo Kepublic an caucus has been unable to place him, althoueh it may do so to-morrow. speaker Crisp spent the day at the Capi tol seeing members of Congress and others and attending to bis correspondence. He has ascertained the wishes of a great num ber of the members of the House. The Speaker said this afternoon that no con clusion had yet been reached as to the com mittets. nor had any of the various chair manships at his disposal been tendered to any persons. The character of the commit tee on rules has not yet been decided on. nnd the proposition to make it up without reference to the chairmanships of the ways and means and appropriations is still under discussion, and there seems to be a stroug probability that tbat plan will prevail, there being a prejudice among tne average ruu of members against placing all the power of the House in the hands of the chairmen of the two leading committees. The greatest trouble will be to get the right men to servo on rules, Astn inde pendent committee, this will be more dilli cult of organization tbnn any other. There arc but two Democratic members ot this committee beetles tho Speaker and two Kepublieaus. There may be a proposition made to tho House to increase the number by adding ouo moro member to tho ira ority. ritorosi:i liihislatiox.
