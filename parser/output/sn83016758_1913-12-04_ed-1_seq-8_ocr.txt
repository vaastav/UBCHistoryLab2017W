Eoast turkey and other good things in plenty were served in the basement and this was followed by an entertainment in the mam body of the church. A very good program appropriate to the day, including musical selections, addresses and recitations, was presented. The speakers were Rev. Fisher and Prof. Ewing, and W. G. ("Tom Keene") McVicar gave a reading in true Shakespertan style. Miss Margaret I King also gave a reading, and Misses Eva Eoss and Gertrude Bishop recitations. There were also piano solos, duets, and vocal selections bj the choir and a mixed quartet. How to Avoid Tuberculosis. The first essential in the avoid ance of tuberculosis of the lungs, or consumption, is to keep the lungs strong, so that if the germs are breathed they can do no harm. One of the most important things in keeping the lungs strong is to keep the chest wide open so that the lungs can be properly used. If the body is drooped or stoops, or if the shoulders are allowed to drag forward (round shoulder), or if the head is cairied forward instead of well back over the shoulders, the chest must be flattened, the breathing must be shallow, and the lungs, not being freely used, become weak. It is in this type of chest that tuberculosis usually begins. The consumptive is usually narrow-chested, with drooped shoulders and with the head craned forward. While the development of a strong, well-formed chest is one of the most important factors in pre ventiang tuberculosis, the same thing is to be desired if the disease has once started. Not only should we live in the open, but we should stand up straight and learn to "throw a big chest," so that the lungs can grow strong and the fresh air be taken in. The runner, the singer, or any one who is obliged to make sustained effort, is taught to stand and sit with the chest high so that the lungs can be used to the best advantage, and if every one would do the same thing there would be less tuberculosis because there would be fewer weak lungs.Press Bulletin of American Medical Asso ciation, The President's Message. President Wilson on Tuesday read his first annual message to congress. It was a particularly brief document, containing only about 3,000 words, a digest of which is given hereunder: MexicoMexico has no govern ment. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority. The collapse is not far away. FarmersPending currency bill does the farmers a great service. The farmer is the servant of the seasons. The farmer and the govern ment will henceforth work together as real partners. BusinessLet the Sherman anti trust law stand unaltered but reduce the debatable ground by more ex plicit legislation to make it fairer to all concerned. Special message prom ised.

The Potato in Germany and America. Bulletin No. 47 of the United States department of agriculture, lust issued, is a valuable pamphlet and is free to farmers and others who write for it. It gives the rela tive importance of the potato in German and American agriculture. Among other things, it says: "The potato in Germany takes a more important place than with us. Though the country is much smaller than the United States, the area planted is 8,165,000 acres, as com pared with 3,566,000 acres in the United States. The average total yield is 1,653,403,000 bushels, or 202.5 bushels per acre, as compared with our average of 343,587,000 bushels, or 96.2 bushels per acre. If the states of Maine, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota alone were to plant 12.5 per cent of their arable land in potatoes, as Germany does, and secure an equiv alent yield, the product would amount to 1,558,944,000 bushels, 4% times our present production from the entire country. At the present rate of consumption of potatoes in the United States, which is con siderably less than 3 bushels per capita, the needs of the entire country could be supplied from any one of the states of New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, or Minnesota and leave a surplus unused, whereas all the states combined have several times failed to produce enough pota toes to supply the domestic consump tion, and In such years large quanti ties of potatoes have been imported from foreign countries. The per capita consumption of potatoes in Germany is 7.3 bushels." Loses Home by Fire. The home of John Romaine, in Greenbush, with its contents, burned on Saturday afternoon at about 4:30 o'clock, the fire being attributed to a defective chimney A small in surance was carried on the property. Mr. Bomaine is an industrious young man who, since the death of his fatherwho was killed about a year agohas been striving to provide for his five brothers and sisters and give them schooling. For many years the mother of the children has been in an insane hospital. The fire loss leaves the family in needy circumstances, the children's clothing as well as the household goods having been consumed. I is a case deserving of public assistance, and one where such assistance would be greatly appreciated by the un fortunates. Kills 300-Pound Bear. Last week Joe Whitcomb, accom panied by Luther Nauss of Pennsyl vania, shot a 300-pound bear in the Groundhouse river country, north of Page. The bear was in a hollow log, and after Joe had fired three bullets into its head, every one of which took effect, Bruin came forth to reconnoitcr and would doubtless have put up a pretty stiff fight had not its jaw been broken. Even thus handicapped, it chased the hunters a considerable distance and tried to claw them, but it eventually fell over dead. I would take a whole jungle full of bears to scare Joe Whitcomb, but his friend from Pennsylvania was much relieved when the bear gave up the ghost. THE 

PRINCETON UNION: THURSDAY, DFCEMBEK 4, 1913. William E. and C. White left on Monday for Montana, where they ex pect to make their future home. After visiting two sisters, who live in that state, William will work in a sawmill at Missoula, and in the spring take up a claim. A farewell party was given by friends and neighbors to the White boys at their home in Baldwin on Friday evening which they greatly appreciate. They had lived in Baldwin for over 40 years. The Union hopes that they may prosper in their western home. Some people are always telling of what they "used to do" and "what they would do'' if they were afforded an opportunity. These "have beens" and "would be's" never have and never will accomplish anything, and when an all-wise Providence calls them hence they never will be missed. Chas A. Forbes and R. M. Oooley of the state highway commission came up from St. Paul on Saturday. From here Mr. Forbes went to Cam bridge and Mr. Cooley returned on Monday to St. Paul. Mr. Forbes is a distant relative of Archibald Forbes, the famous English war corre spondent. An agent of the Dan Patch elec tric line running south from Min neapolis was in town this week sell ing stock of the company and found several purchasers. We hope those who purchased stock will realize large dividends on their investment, but all is not gold that glitters. Backward Springs. The spring of 1913 has been termed a backward spring, but the year 1909 takes the prize for backwardness. A record of the weather for the month of April, 1909, shows that snow fell in the northwest on April 4, 7, 9, 12, 14, 18, 21, 22, 24, 28, 29, 30 and May 1. Between April 29 and May 1 fourteen inches of snow fell. On the 14th of April the snow continued all day. Those who had golden grain belt beers in the house took the most comfort advertisement.
