"This action" explained Col. Kowalski, "can settled the whole question In short. If Sharkey, F.arp, Lynch and that clique are In the right they can got it and prove .1. If they me In the wiong they will bring u;i some techlcsllty and cause delay. "We will appear before Judge Sander sou and produce our witnesses: we will ?how thai there wasaconsphacy,by which Fltsslmmona was robbed of $10,000 and the evidence which we have in our posses? sion Is overwhelming. The reason we <?<.. sire to put our case before the conn is that witnesses in affairs . t this kind are of a migratory character. Their business calls tloui away. While they are here we want to hei r tb. !r testimony Instead of having to delay matters by having to send out of the State for depositions, if the Lynch-Sharkey side wishes to not in good faith and hopes to pronerii a clear case, it can produce Its evidence cither to? day or tomorrow, There is no reason for the delay in tl? matter.
