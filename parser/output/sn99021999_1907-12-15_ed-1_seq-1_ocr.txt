The topic of the hour in Irish political circle Just now il the propct of political unity, which Is believed to be brighter than It has been at any time for the last two or three rear. The first move In the preaent negotiation! waa made by William O'Brien, who haa been out of the party fold for aome time, and who declared publicly that ha waa willing to meet Mr. Redmond and Mr. Dillon In a conference to discuss a plan of union. It at no suggested that Mr. Hoaly, who haa been running a little party of hla own, and Sir Thomaa Esmond and Mr. Dolan, who were excommunicated be cause they subscribed to the Sinn Fein heresy, sltould be Invited. To this Mr. Redmond has replied that he Is willing to go Into such a conference, and he adds that ho has reason to hope that It will be held, and that the Irish party will preaent an absolutely united front at the next sessiqn of Parliament. The negotiations have given rise to the usual crop of rumors about ths terms of agreement, and almost every newspaper In Ireland has published Its own plan of a settlement. None of these are correct, for no plan has been even sketched out yet, but I am In a position to state that all the factions are agreed on two or three clauses which must form part of the peace treaty. One of these Is the continued leadership of Mr. Redmond, for there Is no man In the party of, equal skill as a parliamentarian, or who Is fitted to conduct the delicate ne gotiations with the English politicians which must 'be undertaken by the Irish leader. Will PrMt Homo Hole' The second Is that a genuine home rule bill shall be pressed forward at the next session, and If the liberal government can not be Induced to take It p. It will be In troduced and managed by the Irish party themselves. . Another plank In the new platform Is that while every effort must be made to obtain genuine and complete home rule, the party must not lose sight of the need of Immediate legislation to remedy ths economic and sovlal evils which prevail In Ireland, and must be prepared A accept and anprmrt any reasonable meas ure of rrtetHmriSrW' offered by either of J the Kngllsh parties, and that It must also do all In Its power to encourage and sup port the Industrial revival movement In aufurated by the Sinn Felnersv I am also, able' t state that the credit for .the restoration of unity In t! Irish party, tf It U restored, is due to the strength gained by the Burn Fein movement and the . defection to It, of men like Sir Thomas Esmond. There can be little doubt that some, of the Irish leaders had been ao long at Weatmlnster ' and had become so engroaaed In parliamentary affairs that they had lost touch with the progress of events and of opinion at home. The sudden growth of Sinn Fein and lta threat to swallow the party brought them to their sense and In. dueed them to devote more attention to what was going on at home than they had done for years. Cattle Drive fnjast. ' One immediate result of the reunion will probahly be the abandonment of the policy of cattle scattering which has already been' condemned by many of the most thoughtful men In the party, and In Irish life. Only a few days ago the Most Rev. Dr. Healy. archbishop of Tuara. at mass In the cathedral, denounced the cattle drives as unjust -and Immoral, and lamentable folly. They were directed, he said, against a class of men who were as good irishmen as the cattle driver themselves, and only served as a weapon to strengthen the de. mand of the enemies of Ireland for the revival of coercion. One of the most fsmous boycotts of re .cent year ha Just ended In victory for the boyretters. A family named Brady nve years age teok five evicted farms In county Ieltrlm. Since the day they' took ttie farms they have been rigidly boy cotted. They have been guarded rrtght and flay by a force ef pelloemen who lived on the farm and they have been compelled to get their supplies fron as far away as nny miles, several times when they were bringing heme their supplies their carts have been overturned and the feod de stroyed. A few days ago they gave up the nght and surrendered their-farms to the estate commissioner for division among the people. The occasion wss celebrated by bonfires all over the county. Strike of the Doctors. A remarkable situation which can only be described a a strike of the doctors has . arisen at Carrlck-on-Suir, because of the recent decision of the local guardians to Reduce the scale of fees paid to the med ial officers at the workhouse and publl" dispensary. The doctors refused to accept this reduction, but went a step further and, on tho theory thst ' the guardians were acting as the elected representatives of all the people.- they have determined to raise their scale of fee for general practice to a point that seems almost pro hibitive They began by fixing their Tates ror workhouse and dlspenaary work at JXIi-etiii t.a.76 a week, respectively. In private practice they refuse to accept less hun lit 50 and mileage for a day consul tation, or 115.78 and mileage for consulta- lon at night, while their midwifery charce a ill be liL!i. The guardian have so fsr taken no action, but they threaten to break the strike by Importing nounlon doctors from England. It la doubtful, however. If ny can be found, for the rules of the pro fession are very strict on this aide of the Atlantic, and the medical men have more han once succeeded In bringing local eu- naritiea to terms. The Ormonde Hunt, which la one of the argest hunts In Ireland, has been dls- nded for the season because of the df crmlned opposition to It displayed by the eople of the Dunkerrln and Bhlnrone dls- .rlcts. , Tne opposition arises from the fart :hat two or three notorious landgrabbers were among the membership, and the local orancn or me I'nited Irt&h league served (Continued en Second rage,) SUMMARY OF THE BEE Bandar, Drrriufcrr IB, ltOT. 1007 DECEMBER 1907 U HON TVS t0 HM SAT I 2 3 4 5 6, 7 8 9 10 II 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 10 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 ' T 1 THI WSITKSK.

Signals of distress were heard at the Bishop Rock lighthouse at 4 o'clock yes terday afternoon. The lifeboats at once ut out and found the Thomas W. Lawson anchored In a dangerous position Just north of Gunner Rock. Great seas were running and the lifeboats, although they stood by for several hours, were unable to render assistance. At the request of the captain of the Lawson the St. Mary' lifeboat, tho masts of which had been broken off In attempting to rescue the crew of the schooner, put back with the purpose of telegraphing for a tug to come to the assistance of the Law son.
