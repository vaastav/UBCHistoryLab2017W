TUESDAY EVENING, DEC. 5, 1B8'2. The synopsis of the President's message ; printed in yesterday's Gazette was really a better document than the Message itself, all the points of which it contained. The full t? \t of the Message is a long, prosy and uninteresting compendium of the reports of the several departments of the government, the gist of which had been published weeks before, which could have been prepared as well, if not better, by any clerk in the ex ecutive office lit was probably by one of them) as by the President himself, and the preparation of which indicates anything eb:e than the work of a niau at all above a low ijrade of mediocrity. When he leaves his clerical work and goes off on his own hook he exposes himself at once to the shafts of his opponents. lie does this when he agrees with all t lies employes of the Internal Reve nue service, from the commissioner down to the detectives, who would be forced to work for their living if removed from their offices, that the abolition of that service would bo unwise. Ilischaracter doesn't in duce the belief that bis desire for t lie main tenance of theservicearises ftom any charita ble disposition toward its employes, but rath er suggests the idea that he wants these em ployes retained in order not only to pay them for the valuable work they did for his party at the laic, but also to engage them for simi lar work ;it the next election. The negroes in Virginia, under the manipulation of these internal revenue officials, fairly elected three Arthur men to the next Congress; the s.ime officials all through the South, and Noith loo. worked hard and effect ive1>*in the stalwart cause. If retained in the pay of the Government they will work as hard for the President at the next election as they did at the last one. And then, too, Gen eral Miilione has promised the Pre.-ident the vote of Virginia at the next national re publican convention, and that promise can not be fulfilled without the active services of the revenue officers. The farmers of Vir ginia want the tax on tobacco removed, and also want the right to .<ell their tobacco, as they sell their wheat and corn and other products, to any body who many desire to buy it,"and not have their market restrict de, us it now is, u> a few licensed purcha sers as they arc by the internal revenue laws. But what are the rights of Virgiuia farmer* compared to the terms of a nefari ous bargain with Mabone? He denies that he has made more than tho usual number of removals, when it is a well known fact that iii the pcstoflice service alone in Virginia there have been more changes since he made his bargain with Mahone than there were in all th? previous twenty years put together. Ho also asserts th:it lie i-; opposed to politi cal assessments, and yet women were forced to pay those assessments last fall under threats of removal from the places they held. He says he wants the star routers punished, and yet he complimented the chief of the uang at a public dinner, and thouyn made aware by Mr. MacYeagh more than u \cur a<;0 of the means that were be ing used to shield them from the punish ment due their crimes, was only induced by the recent election to interfere with the further use of those means. He winds up bis twmty-rive pages with thanks for the deu?\ of sectional animosities and for the conservation of the public credit, when he endorsed the last campaign book of his party, the main object of which was to keep alive sectional animosities, and when he allied himself with the repud'ators in Vir ginia, who said that the principles of read justment should be applied to the national a-i well as to the State debt. The message retleets credit upon neither the heart nor the brain of the President, and. as a State paper, is probably the weakest one ever issued from the White House. As statkd in yesterday's Gazktte, the Arlington estate, in this county, was on that day restored to iN rightful owner by a decision of the Supreme court of the Toiled States, and thus justice, though long com ing, has come at last. The only conceivable point in the case was that which denied the right of the citizen to sue the Govern ment, but that was swept away by the j higher right of the citizen to his property. 1 and to recover it when it li:i< been taken ' from him by the strong hand. T<? have de- i nied the owner of Arlington this right would have put every land-owner in the county at the mercy of any Government official who might choose to ou-t him and take possession in the name of the Govern ment, and once ousted, to put him beyond the palc*of recovery because the Govern ment could not be sued. Such an assump- j tiou could not be maintained under any j modern^imperial Government, and it was I absurd to attempt it under a free govern-1 ment in which no man can be dispossessed : of his properly w ithout due proccss of law. j A feature of the President's message is J the decided stand that it takes in favor of! postal reduction. The President recom- j mends that letter postage be reduced to two per half ounce. He says : "I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the public." The Washington Monument has now reached an altitude where the top is ou a lev el with the*head of the Goddess of Liberty ou the dome of the Capitol. The derrick is twenty-eight feet higher. 

FROM WASHINGTON [Special Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazelle.) Washington. T). December ?>, 1SS2. In the Senate to-day Mr. Beck introduced a resolution, which, under the rules, went over until to-morrow, providing for a spe cial committee to investigate ail aude\etj tiling pertaining to the political assessments collected during the last campaign by Mr. Hubbell, and Senator Mahone, mentioning the latter by name and containing an ex tract from the assessment circular with his Mgaature. In introducing it Mr. Beck al luded to the fact that the President, in his message had avowed his opposition to such assessments, and said that in view of that he did not suppose his resolution would meet with objection on the republican side 0 l the chamber. Mr. Edmunds' resolution fur meeting at 11 instead of 12 o'clock then came up lor consideration. Mr. Garland opposed it, and said its introduction re minded him of a church meeting in which one member thought (4ass meetings should be held twice a week, another that they should be held on alternate nights, and still another who thought that as the spirit was always at work, they should be held every night. Mr. Beck also opposed it, for the reason that the committees must have time to work. In his remarks he said said he intended to in troduce a resolution limiting the Congres 1 sioual holidays to Christmas and New Years I Day. Mr. Ingalls thought the spasm ot in ! dustry indicated by the introduction of the I resolution might lave been provoked by the recent election, ilis party, had, he said been sorely bulb led, but if the resolution was an indication of penance for past mis deeds. and a promise of improvement in the future, while disposed to look upon it lh the, precious jewel in the toad's head, the one good thing iu the wholeresult.bewas never theless indisposed toudoptit. Mr. Edmunds denied that the resolution was the result of a thought about the recent election. It was defeat ed on an aye and no vote.and the hen ate will hereafter us heretofore meet at noon. The Senate standing committees were con tinued as they were by simple resolution. An Indian bill was then taken up and is now under consideration. In the House the Ways and Means Com I mitlee reported a bill for the abolition of all | taxes on all sorts of tobacco. It was put on j the calendar and will be considered, at an early day, and. it is probabled, will go through without much opposition, though the republican caucus :it the last session pronounced against it. It will reduce the revenue of the country to the extent of about forty-six millions. It will probably be amendul so as to provide for rebate on unpaid packages. It is reported that Mr. Beck, for some reason or other, will oppose the passage of this bill when it reaches t he Senate. A number of bills were then in troduced, among tlicm one by Mr. Garrison from the 1 >ist. of Col. Committee, authorizing the Secretary of War to condemn the piers of the Alexandria Canal Aqueduct, for a free bridge. A bill was passed allowing ship masters abroad to send their discharged seamen home or provide them with other places, instead of being compelled, as now, to give them three months' wages. The death of Senator Hill was then announced, and the House adjourned. Ninde-.nannV r.tory before the Jeannette j hoard was concluded to-day. "It was the | most affecting story of all that had been told 1 of the ill-fated ship and her brave crew. In the star route trial to-day a few jurors I were obtained before the court adjourned.

Election Frauds, &c. In the Hustings Court of Richmond yes terday the grand jury for the December term met, and was charged by Judge C?. L. Christian in regard to the vio lation of the laws against fraud in elections. Judge Christian referred to the recent ar 1 rests by federal authorities of citizens on I charges of forgery or perjury, or both, in i the assessment of citizens of Virginia with 1 the slate tax prior to the lateelection. These i offences he claimed to be offences against the laws of the State, and he informed the | jury that il was their province and duly to ! inquire into such charges. and if there have I been violations of these laws to bring ollen ! ders before this court for trial. He said the i jurors of I'nitcd States courts are selected from all parts of the districts in which they I are held. As to offences against state laws j they are in the contemplation of the law as ; much foreign courts as those held in St. Pe tersburg or Vienna, with nn jurisdiction whatever. In cases of offences against the States laws he claimed that the action of the United States Commissioner in investigat ing the cases referred to was a nullity. Judge Christian also called the attention of I the grand jury to the coarse, vulgar, stand j erous and libellous matters given to the i world by the press and by individuals to I defame the character and disgrace the fam ilies of citizens. Nothing, he said, was sa j credfrom these iufamousuml insidious shafts i from the pulpit down. Whether true or i false, these libels and slanders are criminal j in the eyes of the law, because they teud to ; breaches of the peace : and he desired the I earnest consideration of these subjects, so i that they may be punished and suppressed. The grand jury was engaged inquiring in ' to the matter of the issuance of allegedllle gal capitation tax receipts before the late election by John J). Snclling, the deputy i collector appointed by the Auditor of Pub lic Accounts, w hich appointment is said to have been together with the execution of the bond given by the appointee, fraudulent and criminal. The auditor and other officers in the Slate capitol have been summoned. The bond given by Snclling was called for in court by the Commonwealth's Attorney, Mr. Witt, and could not be found in the Au ditor's office. Illness of Col. Mayo.?The X'ortlurn Xeck Xeirn of Friday says: There was no Court at Montross on Monday last, which was the regular monthly term of the Coun ty Court of Westmoreland, owing to the ab sence of Judge Mayo. It was reported that the Judge was detained at his home by the illness of his son, Col. Iio. M. Mayo, who is said to be quite sick.

No vember 5th. 17S1., leaving a widow and two small children. Washington having at his deathbed promised to adopt the children. Subsequently Washington married the widow and the children grew up to maturity at Mt. Vernon. After the death of Washington, in 1799, and Mrs. Washington in May, 1801. Mr. C'ustis. who was the youngest child, having just arrived at manhood, remained , at Mt. Vernon long enough to settle the es tate and removed to Arlington. In 1S04, Mr. Custis married Miss Mary A. j Fitzliugh, who dispensed the hospitalities of i the house for nearly fifty years, her death taking place in April, 1S53, and Mr. Custis 1 died October 10th, 1S57. aged 76years. Mrs. j Lee was the only issue of this marriage, and : the will of Mr. Custis, bearing ?the" date of j March 26,1855, bequeathed to his daughter, j Mary Ann Eandolph Lee, the Arlington ! house estate, containing eleven hundred j acres, more or less, and other property, and ? provides: "On the death of my daughter, Mary Ann Itaudolph Lee, alUhe property left to her during the term of her ! natural life, 1 give and bequeath to my eldest grandson j George Washington Cu9tis? Lee, to him and his heirs, forever, he my said eldest grandson, taking my name and arms. "My daughter, Mary A. R. Lee, has the privilege by this will of devising my family plate among my grand children ; but the Mount Vernon altogether and every ! artiele I possess relating to Washington, and that came from Mount Vernon, is to remain with niv daughter at j Arlington House during said daughter's life, and at her death to my eldest grandson. George Washington Cits- I tis Lee. and to descend from him entire and unchanged ! to my latest posterity.*' On the paternal side Gen. G. W. C. Lee is j descended from revolutionary stock,a graud son of the dashing "Lighthorse Harry.one . of the favorite officers of the clftitinental ar my. Before the war, being in the artillery | branch of the army, he was stationed at' Fort Washington, within sight of Mount Vernon, and he followed his father uniting his fortunes with the South, serving on the statTof Jeft'Davis. After tin* war he devo ted some of his time to the restoration ofhis ' property on the Pamuuky, and succeeded j his father in the presidency of the Wash- j ington Lee University, which positiou he I now holds. In the early part of the war Ar- | lington was in the hands of the coufeder- j ates for a short time, and during the first i months of the war the people of the District were fearful that it would be forti fied. By the advance of the federal forces in Virginia, however, the estate came within the union lines, and within the grounds ad joining the mansion a national cemetery was j established, the bodies being interred in long lines on a level piece of ground south- j west of the house. This portion of the es-; tute was first of all fenced in, but since then j the wall lias been built, and the place has j also been greatly beautified. There were ; interred here during the war nearly 18,000 j Union soldiers, about o-r>0 confederates, and , about 4,000 contrabands. The remains of over 2,000 soldiers, gathered on the field at j Bull Run and on the routeto theRappaban- ! nock, are placed under the monument to j i''The Unknown." Since the war numbers of the bodies have been removed, and at this time there remain in round figured probably If),000 in this "City of the Dead." On a portion of the estate occupied as a i fort during the war the government has established what was originally Fort Whip ple, now Fort Meyer, where Capt. R. P. Strong, oue of the defendants, commauds. Other portions of the estate are occupied by quite a village, known as Frecdtnan's village, having been settled by the contra bands who came through the liues. At Mr. ! Curtis' death lie owned about '200 slaves, some SO being on Arlington place, and there are 10-day a number of those freedmen still living on the place. I'nder the act of Congress of June 7th, IS02. for the collection of direct taxes, and in accordance with the proclamation of President Lincoln, dated January Oth, 1 SGI, the Arlington property was sold to the United States tor the sum of ?20,800 by John Hawxhurst, Gillet F. Watson and A. Law rence Foster, U. S. direct tax commissioners for Virginia. The amount of tax was but S92.07.' lu February, 1872, Mrs. Lee. by her counscl, Mr. F. L. Smith, of Alexandria, presented a memorial to the Senate through Senator Johnston, concluding: "Your petitioner and her son, G. W. C'ustis Lee, tthe owner of the reversion.) are willing to avoid, however, all litigation on the subject, and to have an amicable settlement of this mi lter. With this in view, they now otler to the govern ineut of the United States, through your honorable bodies, that upon the receipt of $300,000 they will exe- j cute and deliver such necessary releases and con veyances as may be adjudged sutlicient to sanction and quiet any claim which the government may now have by making a legal and valid title to the property." No report was oyer made on this me morial. Mrs. Lee died in November, 1873, and George Washington Custis Lee took an estate in remainder in Arlington, On April (ilii, 1874, the latter presented, through Senator Johnston, a memorial making the sami* proposal his mother bad submitted, and it was referred to the judiciary commit tee, with a bill for the purpose. No report having been made on this peti tion the suit was brought in the courts. Justice Miller in delivering tho opin ion of the court yesterday said that the most important question presented is whether suit can be brought under any circumstan ces against the government of the United States without that government's consent. The court holds, first, that the United States cannot be sued as a party defendant in any court whatever except where Congress has provided for such suits; second, that this exemption is, however, limited to suit against tho United States directly and by name, and cannot be successfully pleaded iti favor of officers and agents of the United States when sued by private persons for property in their possession as such officers and agents; third, that in such cases a court of competent jurisdiction over the parties before it may inquire iulo the lawfulness of the possession of the United States as held by such officers or agents, and give judge ment according to the result of the inquiry. The court further holds that the constitu tional provisions that no person shall be de prived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor private property taken for public use, without just compen sation, are intended as limitations upon the power of the government in its dealings with the citizen, and relate to the class of rights whose protection is peculiarly the province of the judicial branch of the gov .eminent. The courts are bound to a fiord a remedy for unlawful invasions of rights of property by officers of any branch of the government. Speaking of the rights of individual as against the government , Justice Miller says: "'What is the right of the defendant in error as established by the verdict of the jury in this case? It is the right to possession of his homesiead. A right to recover that ! which has been taken from him by force and violence and detained by the strong hand. This right being clearly established, we are told that the court cau proceed no further, because it appears that certain mili tary officers, acting under orders of the Pres I ideul, have seized this estate and converted I one part of it into a military fort and another into a cemetery. It is not pretended, as the ease now stands, that the President hail any lawful authority to do this, or that the legislative body could give him any such authoirly except upon payment ofjust j compensation. The defense stands here | solely upon the absolute immunity from j judicial inquiry of every one who aaserts | authority from the executive branch of the j government, however clear it may be made I that the executive possesses no such power | and not only that no such power is given, I but that it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the leg islative, to deprive any one of life, liberty or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compen ! salion. No man in this country is* so high i tliat he is above the law. No officer of the j law may set that law at defiance with impu ! nity. All the officers of the government? 1 from the highest to the lowest?are crea ' tures of the law, and are bound to obey it.'' In conclusion Justice Miller says that the. Circuit Court was competent to decide the issues in this case ; that no error has been fouud, and that the judgment is affirmed.! Justice Gray read a long dissenting opinion, which was concurred in by Chief Justice Waitc and Justices Bradley and Woods. The United States will now endeavor to ac quire a valid title to the Arlington estate, either by direct purchase from the Leo heirs or by instituting condemnation proceed ings.' The members of the family have declared that they have no intention of ever disturb ing, in any way, the cemetery established upon the* old estate. It is expected, as a decision has been rendered in their favor, that Congress will appropriate an amount sufficient to secure the United States in their title.
