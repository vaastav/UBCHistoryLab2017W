GEORGE M. ROBESON. Carping at the President's Motives. The partisans of this administration take excep tion to the President's motives in proposing to at tend tne funeral of Mr. Greeley. They are gene rally distinguished from the class recognized as Statesmen by their exalted opinion of thomselves or their high appreciation or their own services in the campaign. The President, on the other hand, expresses the opinion that it is a sorrowful duty which ftg will perform shouljl jiublic business uot deman<uits presence7n WashingtoiC ??- - Probable Adjournment of the Senate ^ Vntil After the Funeral.

This will create a vacancy which the Southern States will naturally claim, as there has been no Southerner on the Bench of the Supreme Caurt since Judge Wayne died In 1887. Indeed, the friends of Senator Pool are already asking the place lor him should the Senator not secure a re-election.

I have the honor to i reside in the city ol New York, once represented by Mr. Greeley In the American Congress. This House lias heard with profound sorrow of the tragical death of one or Its most illustrious citizens, Horace Greeley. Ills demise creates a void impossible to All in American journalism. society and lire.

In the va rious qualities of mind and character he is an ex ample of and incentive to that sturdy seU-relfance and unresting enterprise which distinguish Ameri can manhood.

THE SPEAKER RISKS TO RXPLA1N. Mr- Blaine, having called Mr. Cox to the chair as Speaker pro (an., took the floor, and said Mr. Hpkaker? 1 rise to a question of the highest privilege, one that concerns the Integrity of mem hern of the House and the honor of this House it ttclf. During the late Presidential campaign there wan a widespread accusation to the effect tliat members of Congress had been bribed by presents of stock in the Credit Mobilier to perform certain legislative acts for the beneflt of the Union Paclflc Railroad Company. The persons thus chanted with crime are, or had been, in high public station; one of them is tne Vice President of the United States; another the Vice President elect; still another, the Secretary of the Treasury; three Senators of the United States are included?Messrs. Bayard, Fow ler and Patterson. In this House the accusation touches a former honored member from Massachu setts, now In his grave, Mr. Thomas A. Elliott; it in cludes the chairman of Ways and Means, Mr. Dawes; the chairman of Appropriations, Mr. Garfield; the chairman of the committee on Civil Service Re form, Mr. Kelleyithe Chairman of the House Naval Committee, Mr. Scliofleld; the chairman of the Ju diciary, Mr. Bingham; an eminent member of the Committee of Ways and Meams, Mr. Brooks, and an ex-member from the state of Pennsylvania, Mr. Rozer; and It includes the .Speaker or the House, who now occupies the floor. All of these gentlemen are alleged to have received presents or stock in the Credit Mobilier from the hands of Oakes Ames, a representative from Massachusetts presents of stock which were in the nature of bribes. This grave accusation Includes men of both political parties, and men holding, as I have already said, eminent public stations. The charge of bribery of members is one of the gravest that any legislative b6dy is ever called upon to consider, and one that demands prompt, thorough and im partial investigation, i have taken the floor, therefore, for the purpose of moving that a select committee be appointed to investigate these charges and to ascertain whether tney be true or false. Unwilling, or course, to appoint a committee to investigate a charge In which my own name is included, I have called you to the chair to per form that duty. I have selected you because you are a political opponent, held In high honor both in the House and in the country, and when on Saturday last I advised you that I should ask this service from you I placed upon you but one restriction in the selection of the committee, and that was that It should not con tain a majority of ray political friends, and this re quest is cordially concurred In by all the members of this House who are accused with whom I have been able to confer. Without further detaining the Ifonsc, I submit, the following resolution, and unless some gentleman desires to speak 1 will call the previous qvestion Whereas accusations have been made in the public SroM rounded on the alleged letters of (hikes Ames, a ??preventative from Massachusetts, nnrt upon the af fidavit of Henry S. McComb, a citizen of Wilmington, jn the State of Delaware, to the effect that members of this House were bribed bv Oakes Ames to perform certain leclijativ? acts for th s benefit of the Union Pacific Kail road Cufiipahy. by piflsentti of stock in the Credit Mobilier of America or by present! of a Yuluvblc character de rived therefrom;therefore, Resolved, That a s|>eciul committee of Ave members be appointor! pjr the Spj ukar )>ro tempore, whose duty it shall to investigate and aseerJLiilu. jvhethcr any member of this House was bribed by O^lJCiJ AiUftS (lr in,y ?ersoff or corporation In any matter touching ills legislative duty, and that the coiumittec be authorized to scud for persons and papers Mr. Archer, (dom.) of Md., hoped that the reso lution would not be adopted. The question had been already tried by a higher tribunal than the Sousev The American people had passed upon it. e thought It much better for the House to go on with the regular business of the conntry. Mr. Randall, (rep.) of Pa., hoped that the reso lution would be adopted with unanimity, and ho trusted that, in the language of the Speaker, the in vestigation would be lull, thorough and searching. Less than that should not meet the expectations and requirements of the American people. There had been a dark cloud of scandal raised over the Honse, and 1(" was due to those members who had never been Involved In such proceedings that their character should be raised above suspicion. It was also right thai public condemnation should fall on the heads of those, if there were any such, who were implicated In voting for bills In which they were directly or indirectly Interested. Mr. Dawes agreed with Mr. Randall, and hoped that the resolution would be adopted without a dissenting voice. Without expressing any opinion as to the result of such an investigation, it was due to the House, as well as to the members im filtcated, that there should be no shrinking at this Ime from a thorough, exhausting, lair and Impar tial investigation. In times past he had borne his full share of urging on the House the propriety of taking cognizance of charges of this kind when made by responsible authority, ne did not Intend now to shrink from any such Investigation, and he trusted that the House generally would feel in the same way, and that the investigation would be pursued In such a manner that the result would command, as he had no doubt it would receive, the approval of the American people. Mr. Holman, idem.) of Ind., expressed the hope that the resolution would be adopted unanimously. THB 

COMMITTEE APPOINTED. The resolution was adopted, with a few negative votes on the democratic slue; and Mr. Cox, as Speaker pro tnn., appointed as the Select Commit tee MessrB. Poland, Banks, Beck, Niblack and Mc Crary. Mr. Sarornt, for the Committee of Ways and Means, reported TUB INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL, which was made the special order for Tuesday, the 10th Inst.
