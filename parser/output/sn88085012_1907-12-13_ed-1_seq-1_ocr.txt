One man looks at it oneway, another sees it in another light. It is that way with fanning . There are men who seem to think that if they can skin the farm down to the very quick c very year, they are making the most out of the farming, These men think more of the money they get than anything else in the world. Money is their su preme object in life. For they work themselves, and their horses, and their hands from daylight till dark. For that they will scrimp themselves and their families till' Domestic animals and domestic they have little of the real man- fowls as well as human beings are hood left in them: for it is a fact suscetyible to the influence ofjsani thatsuch narrow living stunts all tary or unsanitary conditions. If of the better elements of one's na- the latter prevails, whether in the tore. They die at last, leaving a ] home, the stable or the poultry good bank account, hut that is all 1 house, disease results. they leave, and the world soon for gets them. That is not getting the most out of the farm. What is? The man who gets the most out of the farm is the one who makes not simply a fortune out of it, but Makes a life. He works for the day is that coming ,as well as the day that now is. His ambition is to leave the farm a little better than he found it. This he can do by a system of thorough farming, by weans of which he maintains the fertility of the soil, giving as well staking, every year. He builds f or the future. He studies the heart of his wife J nd little ones, just as much as he Wnks of the care and keep of his •and and his cattle. He takes an Merest in the welfare of the people ab °Uthim, and is ready to do all that he can to insure good govern ment. He lives for the joy of liv ing, and for the peace that comes from right thinking and right liv ing. The man who does these things ma y not lay up quite as much mon ey as the other one, but he w ill n »ve the respect of all who know hil n, and the best of it all is. he "Ol be worthy of that respect. * W P Your Poultry Houses Clean Fi lthy poultry houses are certain J Prove prolific breeding places of d ' se ase. \o anmial can live and th rive in the midst of its own filth.

It is needless to say that these are the farmers and poultrymen whoinvari able pay the penalty of their ne glect. Poultry kept under conditions that are so obviously unsanitary cannot be otherwise than unheal- thy, and the marvel is not that so many of them die. but that so many lof them live. Similar conditions I among human beings would breed widespread infection and cantagionl and result in a woful harvest of death. A filthy poultry house, as near to the family home as are most of the poultry houses in the country, may well be regarged as a serious menace to human health, and it is not putting it to strongly to say that it has been responsible for many outbreaks of croup, diphth eria and typhoid fever, that have been attributed to other causes. .V man should make the same precautions to maintain health among his domestic animals and domestic fowls as he does to ward off diseases in his home. To do this the houses used for lodging his domestic animals and fowls should be kept clean. This being true, and that is true is beyond question; a poultrytnan can com mit no greater folly viewed from the standpoint of self-interest. If nothing else, than to pretnit his poultry house to become filthy. He will have enough to contend with, in any event, but he may set it down as certain that the shortest road to failure and disaster lies through a filthy poultry house.

Ellensburg, Kittitas G THE MESSAGE IN BRIEF SOME VERY PERTINENT POINTS Prom President Roosevelt's Re cent Message to Congress In the effort to punish the guilty it is Loth wise and proper to mm ittlize the (listless of those wllo I have been misled. Tlmsc who suffer arc not apt to forget. The longer wakening is delayed, the more painful it will be. There should be either a national incorporation act or a law licening railway- companies to engage in in terstate commerce, so framed as to give the interstate commerce com mission power to pass upon the future issue of securities and, when necessary, to make 1 a physical val uation of any railroad. Tlr- anti-trust law should not lie repealed, hut made more- efficient. No corporation should be per mitted to engage in interstate com merce that is formed to create a ; monopoly, The real owners of a corporation should lie compelled to do business in their own names. ! The right to hold stock i:i other | corporations should hereafter be | denied to corporations doing inter state business except under strict control. We need a greater elasticity in our currency, provided, of course, we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. Emergency currency must be based on adequate securities and issued under a heavy tax. It is worth investigation to de termine whether officers and direc tors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves, Trust companies should be sub ject to the same supervision as banks. This country is definitely com mitted to the protective system. There is an evident feeling that the time is rapidly approaching when our system of revenue legis lation must be revised. The time to deal with the subject is immediately after a presidential election. Both an income and an inheri tance tax should be part of our system of federal taxation. No advantage comes either to the country or to the individuals by permitting the transmission in their entirety of enormous fortunes. In the last few years il has been made evident that no man or cor poration stands above the law. While the average juryman wish es to see trusts broken up. lie is reluctant when it comes to sending to jail a member of the business community, ft is better to pun ish the prime offender by imprison ment then to line the corporation. Unless the courts themselves deal with this question, it is certain to demand some form of legislative action. . Some way should be devised which will Hunt the abuse of in junctions and protect those rights which it unwarrantably invades. A

To Insjre Egg Production A Missouri poultry raiser says that the safest way to insure the production of eggs at any parti cular season of the year is to set liens so that the chicks will mature ib< ttt that time of the year. Ik has been a breeder of White Ply mouth Rocks for many years, and he causes the chicks to arrive so he will receive eggs the year around. Pullets which mature in the fall make the very best of winter layers; those which mature ill the summer are good layers for summer and fall. By having an incubator and prop erly arranged quarter?, he says chickens can lie,hatched and grown any time during the next year. irviprovcrnent by Selection ((ne of the real stumbling-blocks in the way of successful poultry raising is the failure to observe the practical method of improvement by selection. Where the best pul lets are carried off to market so ! soon as good prices are offered, and ! ilie inferior specimens retained for ! breeding, it is to be expected that 'the stock will deteriorate, and new j blood is then an actual necessity every year, In this way there can lie no permanent improvement in the flock. Keep the best you have at home for your breeding stock. Will Pluukctt bought 811 acres of Mrs. M. A. Pord's ranch near this city yesterday, paying $14,000, or $175 per acre.
