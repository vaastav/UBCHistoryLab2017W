Deniou-Jtie members elect of the lower Iirauch of the Missouri State Legislature should, before definitely tomuiittius rlii'iuelrs to the support of any can didate now in the field, pass carefully upon the qualifications of all with a de termination that no unworthy man thall receive their vote for Speaker of the House. Upon this choice of a Speaker much of the record of the Democratic patty in the House depends. A strong, honest, conservative and impartial Democrat w 111 makp it possible for the Democratic majority to do better woik and more work than would be the ca-e under an incapable and ill-equipped Speaker. His right of organization of the various committees and his direction of the House proceedings place this power in b!r hand--. The Demociat chosi-n for Speaker of the House should be such a man. Uu addition he should be in harmony with the State administration, free of all party feuds and not hampered by per sonal animosities. The Republic urgei the Democratic representation in the House to make mkIi :i choice.""! t""n a party duty. AT H ANNA'S COMMAND. No more convincing pi oof of tin po tency of Mail. Hauud's iutlucnce in con tiolliug Ametitan publii- affairs of the present time could well be possible than Is found In the f.ict that the ship-sub-hidy bill Is the first inenoiiri to be taken up by the United States Senate in Its tesuinptlon of unfinished business. The ship-subsidy bill Is tiuite geneul ly understood to have been framed for the especial aud well-nigh exclusive benefit of the Hanna-Paiync-rije-Staud-dard Oil syndicate. It was Senator Hanna'6 masterful will which compelled the Senate to consider this measure ahead of all other bills now awaiting Senate action. It was Senator Frye, the bill's sponsor, who led in its discussion, airogantly demaudiug favorable action. Back of Mark Hauua and Senator Frye and the syndicate interests that are to profit from this proposed tax of 

."WOO.OOU.OOO levied upon the American people, stands President McKinley, In debted to Mark Hauna and to the syn dicates for his election and re-election to the Presidency. All the influence possible to the administration will be exerted in behalf of the ship-subsidy bill, the word of command for a solid Republican support having been spoken in the President's message to Congress. The ship subsidy bill is tj pically a party measure. 

PANAMA KNOCKED OCT. Those mysterious iufiuences which for the past year or more have been woik iug to sidetrack the Nlcatagua Canal project in behalf of the Panama enter prise of somewhat malodorous memory should now find it difiicuit, ecu with the most lavish employment of the lob by, to obtain a further setious considera tion of their plans. The official report of the Isthmian Canal Commission, now just submitted through the President to Congress, would seem to dispose effectually and finally of whatever doubts may have ex isted as to the greater practical advan tages of the Nicaragua route. The Com mission declares specifically in favor of the latter, aud, after summing up a num ber of its advantages, makes the addi tional and crushing announcement that the Government of Colombia, owing to concessions granted to the old Panama Canal Company, is not free to grant the necessary rights to the United States Uoverument except upon conditions made by the conipauy. It may be taken for granted that this report will exercise the deciding iu.fi u ace in the choice of routes for the con templated isthmian inual. The Com mission thus concluding its lalmrs was appointed for the expressed purpose of impartially aud searchingly Investiga ting the relative met its of the Nicaragua and Panama routes. There will be no excuse for Ignoring Its finding as now repotted to Congress. n;riu:s may lie. All tin- aigtiment made b ilui- in faor of the icdtKtioii of wale: idles in Si. Louis is based on a ioiiiiatNoii of the idtes in St. Louis wiih those in other cities. As, ssur ami Collector of Water Kates Ileiiiiiielmaini submitted to the House of Delegates, 4'oiiiiuillee :i slate tuent whlih as-limed u -w the ost of pumping water in :i luge number of cities and the late per loo nine del ihatgcd to consume is in those itie The "cost of pumping" in St. Louis was suspiciously low and the late to con sumers in Si. Louis was -.u-pii iou-lv high. These iigines wi-ie picM-ntcd -inib touched for by Mi. llemiueliii.imi in the fate of the .-isvertion of Pie-idem Mi - -Math of the Roanl of Publii Inipiove incuts that the Socict.i of Muuuipal 1m pioemeut had attempts! to oinp.ire water lates and water siipplj conditions in the rations iltie-., but had abandoned the effoit after it beaine ewdeni that a Just couipaiisou was absolutely im possible. Any reasoning peisou who will e amine the elements in the problem will readily reach the conclusion th.it ju-t comparison Is impossible and that in deft hands llgutes relating to water rate ran be made to show anything the manipulator of the liguies desii,--. to prove. Take first the tost of supplying ihe water, which must lie .oveicd b the total Income fiom rates. In St. Louis it i ml tides bonds for Waterwoiks on striution and the Interest on them: cost of operating the plant; wear and tear of plant; extension of plant, and ost of collecting the rates. Operating the plant in St. Louis includes two piimpmgs aud sedimentation. Do Mr. Hemnieliiiauu's tiguics on sider all these elements in other nis aa well as In St. Louis? Does ho know whether they do or not? How does he know? Consider next the elements that enter into the other side of the pioblem. Con sider how water rate are assessed in St. Louis and that they ate assessed differently in every city on eaith. First there are meter rates, which vaiy pio portionately with the amount of water used. Next there are arbitraty iate so much for each room in a house, so much for each hydrant, so much for hot and cold bath. There are lavatory rates. There are hose licenses fixed at so much per front foot. Which of these lates does Mr. Hem melmann use when he declares sweep ingly that the rates in St. Louis are 'J'2j cents per huudrcd cubic feet? Can he take any rate which does not include all rates aud say fairly that this is the rate charged in St. Louis? Does he take the rate which best suits his purpose? Does he use the same discrimination in choosing the rates of other cities? His figures seem to Indicate that he does. Can he figure out by any mathematics from arithmetic to quarternlous a fair average rate in St. Louis which can be compaied justly with a similar fair average rate in other cities? He can not. His figures aie worthless ex parte exhibits. HAS 

SEEN THE ROOKS. If the Globe-Democrat hats failed to furnish Republican Representative Sickles of Putnam County with all the data upon which that vociferous news paper so strenuously proclaimed, during the ircent campaign, the alleged lotten ness aud corruption of the Democratic administration of State institutions, there will be an additional loss or con fidence In the Republican organ's t cruelty and fairness of spirit. Representative Sickles is the Republic an member of the legislative investiga ting committee appointed by the Gov ernor for the purpose of examining, along with the Auditing Committee, the books of the vaiioiis State institutions. The committee on which Mr. Sickles represents Mlssomi Republicanism has completed its labors with the exception of an examination of certain State in stitutions located in St. Louis, Farming ton. Columbia and Fulton. Throughout the recent State campaign which ended In the election of Mr. Dock ery as Governor of Missouri the Globe Democrat howled Itself hoarse with de mauds that the Republican p.lity lie al lowed to "see the books'' containing the record of Democratic mauagemtut of these institutions. It asserted in effect that this was all that was necessary to damn the Democratic party in Missouri. It evidently sought to convey the im pression that the State books were kept hidden In secluded vaults, under Demo cratie guard night and day. aud that It was as much as a Republican's life was woitli to even try to get at them. What has the GIolie-Democrat done In the way of posting Representative Sickles in this matteT? Mr. Sickles has had aices. to the books of the State. Has the Globe Democrat assisted him to uueaith the "facis" of Democratic thievery and corruption which it so blatantly proclaimed up to the day of election last month? Has he uneaithed any such facts"? The people of Mis souri will be pleased to hear from the Globe-Democrat on this point. THE TARIFF'S PARI'. Governor-elect Dockery showed grasp of a great subject when during his so journ at Washington he condemned the method of enlarging the American mer chant marine by granting subsidies and pointed out how rccipiocal trade aiisiug from a removal of the present high tariff would achieve the desired end without taxing the Ameiiian people for the benefit of ship ow uers. Reasoning men will icadily appreciate the point he makes when he says. "It smacks of patiiotisui to talk of Ameii can ships carrying American goods abroad, but as a practical question it is well to ask: What are those ships to do for return c-argoes under the policy of high protection?" If the business of transporting cargoes were palpably remunerative there woultl be no need of a subsidy to put Into the field a large number of steamship lines aud with American enterprise Ameri cans might be relied on to get their full share of the lines and of the business. Adjusting American tariff laws to en able Aiuciieaii ships to iairy full ar gues both wnjs acioss the ocean would increase the natural pioiits of ship owners and be a much suier way of at taiulug the desired Imioase of the American iiie'rcliaut uiailne than grant iug subsidies which to be effective must lie continuous. Republican high piotcctioii makes uu natural tiade couditioiis. The attempt of Republicans to remedy ceils icsuliiiig I .'in wrong legislation b additional legislation is u makeshift policj. Tnisis aie to u pie-poudeiatiug degite due to the s.inie taiiif laws which keep down the Allierii.lll lueli ii.llit uiailne V ihoioiigh Idiiii ul the 1 . 1 1 Ill" laws would help llie I idled States in a iiiiiubei ol w.-is.

In .n Hull would loiisltiute a notable ion ei'ssiiin in the potency of the pnpulai will iii this i uuntn. That Serel:ii. of Stale Ilaj was nn dul dominated by the skiiimi niauipu latum of l.oul P.iuuiefolc. the lilitlsh Ambassador. In the framing ol the ttcatj In qmstioit is :i r.iu ibat beialue instantly npp.neiit to the Ameriran pen pie when the leinis of the tie-aty were made public. The document might well have been drawn up iu Downing sttcet by English diplomats ov.clusie-'y, so en tirely was it devised for Euiopean ad vantage and so complete was its sur render of American rights in the prem ise. ll is not strung,., tbeiifuie. that the Prcsiiieiii .-mil his uveilj louiplais.iut Scintao ol Stale should now be on fronted by a Senate which lannot be in duced lo ratify the unamended Ha Paunccfole tieaty. It is not strange that among the most piououiued oppo nents, of such ratification aie a number of Republican Scnatois who on nil other points heartily support the administra tion's policies. The issue between tin nnaiuciuled treaty and one in which shall be lneoiporatcd the Davis amend ment is too plain to be iguoied or mis understood. The one is u uoaty of sur render to England. The other is" a treaty which justly insists upon the mainte nance of this Got ci mucin's natural rights In the proposed canal. It is also natural that the Slate De pal tmeut should now be protesting against the President's willingness to accept the amended treaty, but Mr. .Mc Kinley should bend Secretary Hay to his will in this matter. Mr. Hay has com mitted a great blunder in diplomacy. It is not so much a rebuke of his stupidity which the American people now demand as an asset tion and protection of those rights which he was so willing to sacri fice under the spell of Ibitish Influence. exgl7ndshoi;ld "heed. General Met eler's speech iu the French Semite, urging the Government to au thorize plans for aimy mobilization based on nary methods for the rapid embaikation and debarkation of ex peditionary corps, the object being the invasion of England, is significant as indicating an exceptional hostility to ward Great Riitaiu now rankling in Fieuch bosoms. Neither the lightlj contemptuous bantering of English uewspapeis nor the refusal of the French Senate to openly consider this piopositiou can lessen or obscuio Its significance. It is patent to the world that the national .sentiment of France farors war with England at the first auspicious oppoitunity. This senti ment has been of va-t growth since the Irritating Fashoda incident. It received a striking illustration in the fervor of the French welcome of (lorn Paul Krugcr. The Merclrr dream of lauding a French army on the soil of England Is lis direct expression. Some months ago the opinion was en tertained by more than one authority on European international relations that only the Paiis Exposition prevent! d :i Clash between France and Englind. These recent manifestations of Gallic Anglophobia, coming so soon after the close of the Exposition, make it i lain that the Flench hatred of the Ilr'tish was not overestimated. It will be wis dom on the part of England to watch her traditional enemy ilosclv. Mcrcier himself may he more or less ( onteupii ble. but he was animated bv the na tional spiiit when he pleaded for gov ernment consideration of plans fur ult! invasion of England. When St. Louis signals. "The .s.-.ooo,-000 local fund has been subscribed.' the whole woild will then begin active preparations to partii ip.ite in the St. Louis World's Fair of RHtt. Trustlsm's shlp-sulifldy bill and im perialism's ariny-iucic.ise bill aie being rushed through a Republican Congress as slickly as If the whole outfit were oil a toboggan slide. As soon as the GIobe-Dcmoi tat ucart, that a Missouri county is Demoi ratio it starts its Ananias mill i mining overtime to injuie llmt county's cicdit with the outside woild.' St. Louis's best and most impartial representative men can alone be safely trusted to devise wa.vs and means for the great task of modernbing Si. Louis. Maybe the Pi luce of Wales contem plates coming over next summer In the (liaractcr of a nival mascot for the British whining of the America's Cup. All St. Louis that's worth having will rally iu support of a movement for a clean and modernized St. Louis as the scene of the Win Id's Fair of 1'.hi.:. It begins to look as if the Hay Pauncefote treaty will be ratified by the Senate only when the Pauucefote pait of it lias been eliminated. Poor old Oom Paul Krugcr now learns that sympathy expressed by deeds is a much rarer tiling than that of the spoken variety. .Inat lie VV liutcaonir.

MINER, Of Winchester. 111., who died Tuesday and was burled )esterday. larger, until his cheek for Jl.f.jO was a fre quent caller at the institution'" strong bur. Ho retired from banking in 13S. but .v few weeks lfore h;s death he made kponu the fact that the institution's interests had been remembered in his will. His religions activity circumscribed bis political career to a cirtm extent, which began It IStj. when be became Scott Count)'s representa tive In the Gcmral Assembly of Illinois. In thii capacity he served until IHs. In 1"7 he became cne of the trustees of the Illinois Insane Asvlnm at Jacksonville, serving for twelve )Cars in that capacity. Durlrg the last four )ears of his office he was the president of the Board of Trusteis. In iSJS he became the moderator of the IJjptit General As.-ucl itlon of Illinois, and until tho ea' of his ucath scarcely missed an annual session. Indeed, a grim authority in the buglo'.s tone. There were less than a score of men present, and most of them disappeared to ward the closo of the day. General Egbert L. Viclc, the president of the society, held ids ground, however, and afterwards mado a speech. In which be expressed I1I3 appre ciation of the efforts of the various com mittees. On the platform were temptingly dis played tho soventy-four prizes, which In cluded a piano, clocks, hats, plants, bric-a-brac and all vurleties of fancy work. When the distribution of prizes was announced the phoers, in their eagerness to be In at the death, crowded upon the platform. General Vleie found It necessary to ask those on the platform to step down, as ha feared It might give way beneath their weight. The crowd, however, would not budge. Then the bugle sounded through the hall and Mrs. Richard Henry Savage made an address, which effectually cleared the stazc. Mrs. M. L. Botay was then awarded th first prize, an upright piano. The second, an oil painting, fell to Mrs. Goulard. For the third prize there were fourteen players whose scores were tied. Mrs. M. L. Doane ultimate earned off the trophy. iHHIHHIHHJHHljjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjBHH lr7.!7?tllrS?BsliiH ijMK&viAf"HttdF4'AJHHaH IPlln&Kr.XronflVsvSfeiHH M-'"itItTM- i V iHBi Bl KsrBHHtt'iVlBsfeBeB73"EB"ilH HHMmSiHnMy(KbailH t K3HHHKBVtfm. mH,-jjL&'Bl "BBjBWnlkL "W. vBHI -V V --sx,-rT . . - YK-S-4S.-lr- Ssl
