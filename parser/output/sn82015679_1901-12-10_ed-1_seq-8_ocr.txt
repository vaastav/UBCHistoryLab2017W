"When snowballing time comes around It has been the custom for several years for the boj-s of the Shortrldge High School to conRTegate on the drug- store corner at Pennsylvania and North streets and en joy themselves after school by snowballing passers-by. They do this until the faculty learns that there Is "something doing" on the corner, and the fun Is stopped. Al ways one or more fights take place be tween the boys and some one on a wagon who objects to being used as a target. Yesterday afternoon, after school had been dismissed, about a doxen boys met as usual on the corner and began a look out for "targets." They played no favor ites, and everyone that went by had an opportunity to learn what good marksmen the boys were with snowballs. The fun was at Its height when a laundry wagon passed and the driver was pelted as many others had been. However, this driver ob jected strenuously, and for about fifteen minutes there was a scrimmage that would put a football contest to the blush. It was the High School boys against the laundry wagon driver, and the fight had to be de clared a draw, as neither side could claim a decisive victory. ShortrfdKe IUh School. The Girls' Mandolin Club practiced yes terday afternoon.

TRAFFIC EAST CONGESTED THE TIllMv IJXES ARK fTILIZIXG CA IIS AS STOHEIIOISES. firent Demnnil for HefrlKorntor Cnrs t .Move Ierlnlinlle Frelcht (ien eral and Personal ote. The New- York Central some time ago was notified by the Boston & Maine and the Boston & Albany that they were blockaded with freight and would be unable to accept any more for delivery at present except perishable property. This was dis couraging to the New York Central offi cials, as they had been working to raise the blockades at their eastern terminals and had been congratulating themselves that it was about to be accomplished. But it is feared the congestion will now become as bad as ever, with a fair prospect of com plicating matters west of Buffalo. Some idea of the volume of business moving over the New York Central can be gained from the fact that in October and November the number of loaded cars handled on this one road was nearly 

GO.OOO more than dur ing the corresponding months of ltt'O. Not withstanding the greater number of en gines, with increased hauling capacity, In service on the New York Central the company is still suffering from insufficient power, and this in a large measure is as much, if not more, responsible for the diffi culty experienced In preventing congestion at Cleveland, Chicago and other Western points. The Pennsylvania is experiencing much the same trouble. It is stated that were not a pound of freight shipped in or out of Pittsburg additional it would take two weeks to catch up with the business at that point. The most pressing freights are moved, and those that can be held without great damage to the shippers are held. The Erie is also crowded with busi ness, but it handles less New England traffic than either the Pennsylvania or the Vanderbllt lines, and consequently the fa cilities for unloading freight at the sea board terminal enable them to move the cars more expeditiously. Lack of nefrlerator Cars. Western railroads are short of refrigera tor cars, the weather having become so winterish that these cars are required to handle produce, which has brought them Into great demand, and the result has been that many shippers have been compelled to take chances in using ordinary box cars. So great has been the demand that box cars are being utilized for potato ship ments, and In fact other vegetables, in cluding apples, by placing a man In charge of each shipment and putting a stove in each car. In some instances oil stoves are being used. The unusually open winter has been a good thing for the gardeners of the North, but a time has been reached when the railroads are not encouraging ship ments unless protected against freezing. Fruits and produce are being shipped so great distances and they are subjected to so many different climates that it has be come necessary to protect the produce shipped. There has not been a season in the history of the railroads where fruits and produce have been shipped as great distances as this year, so poor were the crops in the central States, and it must continue through the winter. Personal Local and General Notes. All expert machinists in the Erie shops at Huntington, Ind., have received an in crease In wages of 24 cents per day. The Monon earned in November $.177,018. an Increase over November last year of $43.946. The Wabash earned In November $1.639.573.51. an increase of $207,(JS9.01. The report of General Manager Bacon, of the Indiana Car Service Association, shows that in November it handled 36,005 cars, with an average detention of 1.52 days. The Pennsylvania's coal and coke ton nage for the first eleven months of this year aggregated 29,790,285 tons, an increase over the corresponding period last year of 1,124,430 tons. The Lehigh Valley Railroad has prepared plans for the erection of a large locomotive and car plant at Chain-Dam, near Easton, Pa: The contemplated works will cost in the neighborhood of $2,000,000. J. H. P. Hughart. of the Grand Rapids & Indiana, is authority for the statement that the company is not in any way inter ested in the proposed Ludington & Grand Rapids road, as has frequently been re ported. The Erie is testing on the Chicago divi sion an engine built for the Chicago, Mil waukee & St. Paul. Its weight on the drivers is 126,510 pounds, and on the trucks 43,000. The engine pulled fifty-six loaded cars over the Chicago division with ease. The Lackawanna has placed an order for sixty large locomotives with the Amer ican IcomotIve Company, most of them freight engines. Since Western men took control of the road both the passenger and freight service have increased-very hand somely. J. C. Winans, general traveling passen ger agent for the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton, was in Fort Wayne on Satur day and selected rooms for his new of fices. Mr. Winans expects his headquar ters will be changed from Piqua, O., to Fort Wayne. Warren J. Lynch, general passenger agent of the Big Four, left for New York last night to attend a meeting of the joint passenger committee of the Vanderbllt lines. C. F. Daly, general passenger agent of the Lake Erie &. Western, also left on a similar mission. F. L. Campbell, heretofore trainmaster and road foreman of engines of the Peoria division of the Vandalla, has been ap pointed trainmaster of the main line, O. E. Raldy. who has been trainmaster of the main line for many years, taking his place on the Peoria division. Joseph Ramsey, jr.. president of the Wabash, cays the new independent line now being built Into Pittsburg Is not be ing constructed by the Wheeling & Lake Erie, but by a syndicate friendly to the Wabash interests. The new line will be completed by Jan. 1, 1903. Samuel Sweet, general freight agent of the Lake Erie & Western, says that not withstanding the fact that shipments of grain from points on their lines were l.lOu cars fewer than in November last year, the earnings of November this year were the largest of any like month in the road's history. Passenger p.gents are figuring on the largest excursion business following the holidays to the South and the Pacific flope that the railroads have ever enjoyed. They base this belief on the unusual number of inquiries at the city ticket offices for liter ature descriptive of winter resorts and other Information. The scarcity of labor for railway con struction last spring brought a number of foreigners to Indiana, among them many Italians, who have been employed most of the summer, but with the coming of colder weather in northern Indiana they are seeking more congenial quarters and going south by hundreds. Frank Wilson, who was chief clerk of the general passenger and freight agent of the Findlay, Fort Wayne & Western, who was relieved when the Cincinnati. Hamil ton & Dayton took control of the property. has been callel to Cincinnati to taKe a good position in the tariff and percentage department of the Cincinnati. Hamilton & Dayton. The general rate situation, as disclosed by the recent meeting of presidents of the trunk lines. Central Traffic Association lines and Western lines as well, that the conditions are veey fair, and it is hoped will still be better after the expiration of the present year. No new committees have leen appointed and no matters made sub ject of reference. The New Orleans Picayune publishes an interview with Warren J. Lynch, general passenger agent of the Big Four. Mr. Lunch visits that city with the intention of Increasing the business of the Big Four. He was greatly pleased with the city and pronounces it a capital place to spend the winter. He will take his family there to reside through the winter. The new trains of the Rig Four and the Lake Erie & Western running between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, are already on a very handsome paying basis, creat ing new business and better serving the public than ever before. The parlor cars run on these trains are said to pay better than those running between Chicago and Cincinnati on the Big Four. A. H. Smith, general superintendent of the Lake Shore and the Lake Erie & West ern. bosts of the record the Lake Erie & Western trains are making in time of arrival at destination. One train between Michigan City and Indianapolis has been late but once the present year, and another train but a few times, which was due to waiting on the Wabash at Peru. A recent report Issued by the Santa Fe shows that in 175 the gross earnings were 51.3".(Mt; operating expenses, $7.im, and net earnings, $. o, while in 13"1 the gross earnings were $54.5ri.; operating ex penses. $24.e0.f) and net earnings 

$LUX).(V0. The mileage increased from 711 miles to T.Sj) by acquisition of other lines. The company owns 1,174 locomotives and 3o,.b3 cars. It is stated that William B. Leeds will succeed W. C. Purdy as president of the Chicago. Rock Island & Pacific on Jan. 1. Mr. Leeds is now first vice president. It Is stated that Mr. Purdy has not been forced out of the presidency, and could have retained the position If he desired to keep it. He had been connected with the road since January, ISC. commencing as a bookkeeper in the cashier's office. At the December meeting of the board of directors of the Pennsylvania Company a successor to the late J. Thwing Brooks will be elected as one of the vice presi dents of the company, and J. J. Brooks, a brother, who had charge of the legal department during the long illness of the former, will be selected. The office of gen eral superintendent of motive power prob ably will be filled at, the meeting. The Chicago & Alton and the Chicago Great Western have disagreed. The Alton ran an excursion from Hlgglnsville, Mo., to Chicago with a rate of $4.50 for the round trip. The Chicago Great Western then made a rate of $7.S0 from Kansas City to Chicago and return, and at the same time gave notice that hereafter it would meet from Kansas City any rate possible for the brokers to make because of the Alton's excursion from this territory to Chicago. Mention was made a day or two ago that W. M. Younts had been appointed car serv ice superintendent of the Central New Jer sey road. This road Is now controlled largely by Western men. W. W. Wentz, formerly with the Lake Erie & Western, is general superintendent, and Mr. Richie Is superintendent of the terminals of the line. Mr. Younts was formerly an employe of the Lake Erie & Western and is a son of Mr. Younts, of Crawfordsville, Ind. Yountsvllle, a suburb of that city, was named after his father. Mr. Younts is said to be the youngest man holding so responsible a position in the country. General Manager Russell Harding, of the Missouri Pacific, In answer to a petition of the Grocers' Association relative to rail road employes seeking the bankrupty laws to avoid paying honest debts, replied: "I understand that your intention is that a rule be established and enforced against persons who contract debts with the in tention of never paying the same, but avail ing themselves of the bankrupt law in or der to protest themselves against creditors. I have no hesitation in saying that this company will promptly discharge any em ploye who is guilty of such conduct. If any cases can be shown where an employe of this company has fraudlently contracted debt and refused to pay the same we will not consider him a proper employe, and his discharge will promptly follow." 

FANCIERS HOLD MEETING SKVERAL OF THE OLI1 OFFICERS OF STATE SOCIETY HE-ELECTED. A Committee Named to Confer ivlth Hoard of Agriculture Exhibit a Financial Success. At the last night but one of the show of the Fanciers' Association of Indiana, now being held in Tomlinson Hall, the annual meeting of the members of the as sociation was held and the officers chosen for the ensuing year. It was the largest meeting so far held by the association, thirty-nine of the members being present. Among the visitors was Theodore Ilewes, of Qulncy, 111., associate editor of the Re liable Poultry Journal. Mr. Hewes Is on his way home from Cleveland, where an other big show given by poultry and canine fanciers is now being held, and he told the Indiana men how they conducted the Cleveland exhibition. He made some com plimentary remarks about the Tomlinson Hall show, and declared that it equaled in excellence of management and arrangement the Cleveland exhibition. At the election of officers the follow ing old ones were re-elected: Lora C. Hoss, Kokomo, president; C. J. Ward, Irvington, first vice president; C. W. Hackleman, sec retary, and H. D. Lane, Indianapolis, treas urer. The new officers are: B. S. Myers, Crawfordsville, second vice president; N. E. Woods, Pecksburg, third vice president; W. F.

Johnston, Howlands; William Tobln, Indianapolis, and H. R. Miller, Nashville. It was decided to appoint a committee to confer with the State Board of Agri culture concerning the classification and ar rangement of the premium list for poultry .and dogs at the next State fair. Informa tion as to the amount of the premiums will be sought. The committee was named as follows: President Hoss, Secretary Hackle man, E. B. Murphy and F. P. Johnson. To-day is the last day of the exhibition, and it will be closed to-night at 10 o'clock. None of the exhibits will be disturbed until that hour, and visitors to the show during the last day will be afforded an oppor tunity of seeing the same pet chickens and dogs that were on exhibition earlier In the week. Secretary Hackleman stated last night that the show this year has been very successful financially as well as In other ways. He was unable to state how much the receipts have been, but said that there would be a sum for the treasury over and above the expenses. The attendance has been grood. 

CENTRAL LABOR UNION. l iifavornble Action on Proponltlon to Give Land to Idle Men. The meeting of Central Labor Union last night was short. The grievance committee reported that it had been unable to get the Elliott Telephone Company to unionize its plant and recommended that it be placed on the unfair list if the Electrical Workers Union failed to make a settlement. The committee also reported that it had secured an agreement that the steam fitting on the new Century building shall be done by union workmen. The legislative committee reported favor ably on the resolution emanating from the union laboring men in San Francisco and the Pacific coast asking the assistance of the central body in securing the passage of a bill by Congress providing that the gov ernment shall d' its own shipbuilding and repair its transports in the government navy yards. The recommendation was con curred In. The committee's recommenda tion to table a request to assist In the pas sage of a bill providing for the setting aside of 5.00),()0 acres of land for homes for idle laboring men. to be paid for in install ments, was carried. The committee held that the plan was not feasible and that it was not suflicicnth vouched for by organ ized labor. The committee's recommenda- I tion to supi-ort the Chinese exclusion meas ure whs adopted. Secretary Sloujh read a letter from the carpenters' union of Brazil. Ind.. stating that the Van. Camp Packing Company had written to it, setting out that it had only employed nonunion labor on one occasion; that It proposed erecting a new building and that if the name of the company was not removed from the unfair list no union men would be employed. The matter was turned over to the grievance committee. President Feltman. chairman of the com mittee to entertain the United Mlnp Work ers during thir convention here in Jan uary, reporte-d that the committee would give the miners and operators a banquet on the night of Jan.
