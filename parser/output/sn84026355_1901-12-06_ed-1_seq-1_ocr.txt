Tho annnunio luout thill Senator Mi-Comas (.Mil.) would inaugurate the discussion mi the suppression ol" iiniiivhy nnd inisii" ehlsts tilled Iho senate galleiles today with ii goodly number of spectators. Hefore the- loutine Itiislnut-rf wan tak en up Mr. Utile (Mi.-.) semied the adop tion of a. resolution that when tin1 scn nte .uljout nod today It In- until next Monday. 'I'lic heavy inllux of petitions, bills', etc.. i oiulnui'd, niiieh lime being taken in their formal icccptloii. Mr. Pentose (Pa.) favorably reported fioui the committee on education and labor the bill continuing the Industrial i oiiitnlsislon until I'Vhruary IS, in order that It may close up work now in hand and secured Immediate lonsideration tor the measure. The 1)111 was passed. Mr. Mel'omas was then recognized in support in" his bill Inlioiluied yester day, pioviding the death penalty for assaults upon the president, or for in citing, udvhing or procuring such as- S.l'Jt- The senate snnho ol the dangerous siiread of .miirihy, President I'arnot, Prime Ministi r Oanov.is, the Ihupress rl Austria, King llumheri and tiosi deiil McKinley having hcou foully as sassinated by anarchists within the last seven years. It was humiliating, ho said, to consider the Impoteney of our fedeial laws to punish this feai fill i time. Tin- senate spoke of the i evolu tionary propaganda under the guiding f)uind of JIciv Most, and th nihilist, Il.ii't mini, and the formation since 1SS1 of .inariliist groups. Congress must now legislate against tills peril with courage, llrmness, conservatism and prucleiiie. Tlie constitutional power of oongiess to deal with the subject was dlseiis'-cd at length and supported by numerous leferences to supreme court , divisions. Mr. Mi-Comas lurther urged the exclusion and deportation of an aichlsts, the amendment of the immi gration and naturalization laws ami the negotiation of treaties with foielgu powers permitting the extradition of those charged with anaiclilstlc of fenses. In the course ot his speech the senator argued that International i util ity called for action on our part to suppress the origin of plots In this country against foieign ruleis. Toward the close of his speech, Mr. Mel'omas said: "Wo should enact laws to expel and to exclude alien anarchists. We shall at this session with unanimity le-enuct the Chinese exclusion act. 1 will cheei -fully vote to exclude the hordes of 'hlmi and prevent the competition of Chinese cheap labor. Kar moie iciihly will 1 vote to exclude alien anaicliists here now. We have nnlui alined and even native anaicliists in our midst. With these we must contend in other fashion. Why should we not, as we may, expel alien anaicliists for initsi ."' The senator also urged nunieious amendments of the humiliation laws, with a view lo excluding auanhlsls. In oucluslon, ho said: "At all tlnie-i the body of the plain people that Lincoln lined and upon whom McKinley leaned are its untun ing defenders. This gie.it people, fac ing tlie hideous pel II of anarchism, taught by their sorrow to think straight and see clear, now rate moie highly than ever the value of their gov ernment, prize more than ever Its beiie llts which arc theirs to enjoy and theus to transmit. Mine than ever before au now H'veuled to them Its blessings, its glory and Us power," Mr, McCoinas was accorded i Iomi at tention throughout his remaiks. Mr. Hoar's Plan. St Hi'' conclusion of Mr. Mci'oui.i's remaiks, Mr. Hoar (Mass.) spoke brlolly along the same Hues, He said that, while he heartily agreed with much that hud been said, yet the great dllliculty In all these cases of assassin ation was that the assassin was willing and anxious to give up his lire, Fear of consemieiices did not In any way deter Biich an assassin. Such was the caso with the assassin, f William of Orange, who welcomed the torture. In dicted upon him. i:ery assassin of n foreign i tiler hail expected early and certain death. Tim iniiltlpljrull'oii of punishments for the act imer there, foil) would accomplish little. Much good might be accomplished In limit lug the circulation of fanatical doe, nines. Hut the senator believed that a much innui iilfccllvii remedy muld bo sec in fil If. by common louseni of nil civilized nations, .some trait f ,,, somen lieie oi) the earth's surface, hemmed in from the outer woijd, couhi bo set aside lor the conllueiiieiit of those who counselled the killing of Illicit! or the, ovci throw of gnvi'in. incuts, "Let the anarchists have an olijeet lesson," the senator sad. "and let lite woild have tin object lesson. I,et theie be a III t U Inoculation of nuuich.v Into lie anarchist himself and let him have

Mr. Hoar "aid banishment would he a proper punishment tinder Iho consti tution, and If all nations would agree that every such person bo sent to a spot whole theie was no government, It would be all effective teiiiod). I 'el -talnly the anarchist could not oin plaln, for in being transported to a place of no government ho would hae touched his Clopla. Mr. Mct'omas' r solution was then laid aside for discussion later. The presiding ollleer aimouiiced the following senators as the committee to act with the committee from tile house to consider bv what token of respect congress may osmesis its deep sensi bility at the death of the late President McKlnle. Messrs. Font Iter (Ohio), Allison (Iowa), Fairbanks (Indiana), Keau (New .leisey). Aldrlcli (Rhode Island), Nelson (Minnesota). Perkins lCaliroriii.il. .loues (AtU.insas). Morgan (Alabama).

A message was icicived lioiu the president, iisponsivc to the senate resolution transmitting- the lelleis of .lelfeison to Madison and Monroe on the subject of the auticMitiou of Cuba.

QUESTION OF INSULAR TARIFF The Siioar Trust May Put Un a Fiflht flaainst Philippine Leni-slaiioii. SUGAR CROP VERY LARGE An Effoit Will Bo Made to Block Tariff Legislation Until It Can Be Brought to This Country The Trust Profits by Supremo Court Decision nnd Expects $1,400,000 in Duties to Be Bef untied Bill to Cover Civil Administration of Islands to Be Prepared Soon. IJ.v KvtliiMW Wire In, 111 The As,,i i.itcil 1'ic-t. Washington, Doc. H.--It Is believed that any iniilT legislation for the Phil ippines will be opposed by the Sugar Trust, which, It Is reported, will be glad to have sugar from those Islands admitted 1'iee as long as possible. Since the system now upset by the supreme court has been in operation, ir.j.ooo.OOO pounds of sugar have been imported into the T'nlted Slates from the Phil ippines and the duties on these int poits, amounting to about M,40iJ,O00, will have to be refunded. It Is under stood that the present sugar ciop Is unusually large, and every effort will be made to prevent tariff legislation tyntll alter this can have been brought into the United States. Of course, the beet-sugar Interests will do all they can to hasten legislation. Senator Lodge's Bill. The bill which Senator Lodge intro duced yesterday to meet the emer gency cieated by the supreme court decision in the "fourteen diamond rings" ease was drawn at the war de partment. A similar hill will be Intro duced in the house by Chairman Payne ol" tlie ways and means com mittee. The bill may be taken, there fore, lo embody the view of the ndmin istt ation. Simple though it is. tlie bill will encounter Democratic opposition, and even as a temporary measure will be fought to a finish. Although the bill was introduced first In the senate, It is proposed by the sen ate leadeis to allow the house to act upon it rtrst, in order to avoid any pos sible cause for friction between the two bodies. If the bill were nn ordinary revenue men sine il would, of course, under the eonstitut'on have to origin ate in the house. The best lawyers in the senate do not regard it as a revenue- measure within the meaning of the constitution, as the revenues collected have to come solely from articles im ported to or exported from the Philip pines, and aie to be devoted solely to the benefit of the Philippines without being turned into the general lund of the treasury. They hold, therefore, that under the decision of the Supremo court, since congress lins power to leg islate as It sees fit with regard to the Islands, any constitutional provision in legard to tlie collection of revenue or the method in which levenue hills shall be passed does not apply. However, the matter is one of such pressing Im portance that there will be no attempt to stand on any question of privilege, and consequently nothing will be done in the semite until the house shall be icaily to tut. To Beport at Once. It Is proposed lit the house that tlie ways and means committee shall leport the bill at once. 11' the contention of the Senate is sound, that il is not an oidinary levenue measure, then the bill should go to lite Insular, rutin r than the ways and menus committee, in the same manner that It goes to the Philip pines committee lather than to the fi nance committee In the senate. Some teellng may be aroused for that reason. However, the piesslng Importance of the nicastiie will pi event any seilous dissension. For that lonson, Il Is pol icy to have the bill considered tlrsl 111 the house. Debute lan he limited llieic and the bill 1 an be passed speedily, thus carrying a moral weight at the other cud of the capital; bin tlii-re .ivlll he siillliient debate to leVcal the 1 liar 111 tor of any opposition that may de velop. When the bill comes over to the sen ate, there will be unlimited debate, The Itepubllcaii leaders will he In a hettei position to meet criticism if they have any Inkling from the house proceedings of what line the opposition is likely to lake THE

HUMANE PEOPLE IN A WRANGLE Mayor Jones, of Toledo, Does Not Believe That People Should Be Killed for Crime. Ily Kulti'lvp Wire fiom Hi; .5-01 iat .! I'rc. Toledo, o.. Uec. .".Mayor Samuel M. .lones has resigned from the board of directors of the Toledo Humane soci ety, because its president. Hon. .lames M. Utovvn, who is also president of the American Humane soclotv, declared that a man who deserts Ids children should be put to death. The declaration appears in the an nual report of the Toledo Humane soci ety, and Is as follows: "The man who will In Ins children into the world and In their helplessness desert them, is unlit to bear the Image or either brute or man, Is an enemy to his race, a traitor to his country, and should be put lo death.
