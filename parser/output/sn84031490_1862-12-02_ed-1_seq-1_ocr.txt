MESSAGE. The President’s message was telegraphed Ir.st night to the seaboard cities and sent as fir Trust as Buffalo. But the Superin tendent of the Telegraph Company at Cleveland peremptorily refused to permit it to be transmitted any further West. The press here offered to take it as a special dispatch, but that too was declined. The California Associated Press wanted it, but they also were refused. If the people of the 2fonhwesi are disappointed in not find ing the message In the papers this morn ing, the fault lies not with the Chicago morning press, which did all that lay in their power to obtain it CAN THE NfeGUOES 

FIGHJ? A fad forms a veiy solid pier for an argument to rest upon. Pacts have been called for, on the question whether the fcluclis would fight, and the answer has come once and again from the South Caro lina coast—they will. We gave a short time since a thrilling account of the daring of a company of General Saxton’s black regiment, accompanying a gunboat cxne dilion to the Georgia coast, where they ac quitted themselves with great bravery in an engagement with their • former masters. A second enterprise ia proof oi their courage surpasses the first. It Is fully given in another I column in CoLßeard’s official report of his expedition to Doboy Sound. The officers of these men express the greatest confidence in their, fighting qualities, and after these, practical tests of the courage, even of raw recruits, as were those composing this ex pedition, it is about as well that wc should Lear no more narrow-minded expressions oi- their incapabilities to defend their lib erties. They me the only purely loyal men of the South. The question is less, wheth er the United Stales should employ them, than whether it can afford to do without them. SOME SWEARING TO BE HONE. It should receive the early alleniiou ol Congress the securing that each Assessor under the Revenue Law be qualified lo administer an oath. As it now stands, an additional tax is imposed upon manufac turers and others whose duty it is to make monthly returns of their business, for these returns have to be duly, sworn to, and if before an ordinary officer a fee larger or smaller is to be paid. This should be amended. It should not cost a single penny to attest these monthly returns, find it seems so obvious that the case Should only require a plain statement, to he at once fully remedied. PROF. CAIRNES* SLAVE POWER. Our readers will peruse with interest the review of, and copious extracts from, the noble work of Professor Cairnes, of Dublin, “The Slave Power,” to he found on our third page to-day. It should be read by every American who desires to understand the present struggle, and by every foreigner who would not misunder stand Americans in this crisis. As such, it will accomplish a noble mission on both sides the Atlantic. The Draft in CooK County, W a arc indebted to Mr. A. T.

VOLUME XV. FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. A NOBLE TRIBUTE TO NEGRO DARING. Can tlie Niggers Fight P Official Report of the Com mander, &c. COL. BEARD'S OFFICIAL REPORT. Beautost, S. C., Nov. 25,1562. G eneual; I have the honor to report lb it, as directed by you, I proceeded on the loth Inst., on the United States steamer Darling ton, with 300 of the Ist South Carolina vol unteers, (colored regiment,) in quest of lum ber and other articles needed for the depart ment, The steamer Ben Deford, ordered by you to report to me at Doboy Sound, did not, owing to heavy fogs and adverse winds, reach that point until the iOth iust Oa the 18th: accouipat-ied by the United States gauboat Mcdgie, I proceeded to the mil la located oa Doboy River, Ga. On reaebiag the mill, I fuui«a it necessary t«j reconnoitre the land ad jacent thereto. To do this, it was needful to cress a narrow causewav leading from the mill through a swamp to tee main iand—a dis tance of about 450 3 ards. This high land was heavily wooded, except on the summit, which -was cleared ana occupied with houses. Alt men—tiiiriy-four in number—had no sooner passed across the causeway and through the woods to the clearing beyond than they were firedon by the enemy, who were posted In the thicket in froat’und on both sides. On the lirsi lire one man was dangerously wounded, and a momenta!y panic seized the men, bu r it was only momentary. They speedily rai ded and opened a brisk fire oa the places occu pied by the concealed enemy. Tais lire they kept up with great reguloritv and coolne-s until ordered by me to retire to the ead of the causeway. They retired, firing as they wtnt with a slowness and deliberateness that could net Lave been surpassed by vcf.eraa iiocps. Tl-rce others were severdv wounded while they were retiring. “When my men nactitd tie end of the causeway, I had the bow gun of the Darlington directed on the wooes, after which the lire of the enemy ce.'Std, though numbers of them were seen curing the days and nichts we remained.

To do this m> men worked day and night without iav;r mpriou; and, though short ot provisions, I heard not a murmur.

The lire of Hie enemy was not silenced, however, until the Darlington and Madnie opened with shell upon their cover, the Darlington using a ten pound Parrott and and six pound brass howPzers, and the Muieie firing at longer range, with twenty and thirty pound rifled Parrotts.

MATTERS AT THE CAPITAL. A QUORUM IN BOTH HOUSES. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE The Copperhead Democracy at Work. FIRST DISPATCH. [Special Dippatch to the Chicago Tribune.] TTaehingxox, Dec. I—C p. m., ISC2. There is a full quorum in both bouses. The Presidents message was read in both houses to-day at twenty minutes of 2 p. m., and is now circulating here. The message advocates the emancipation of the slaves of all disloyal ists. It was well received. It is about live columns in length. The Associated Press is sending it by telegraph to all points. The city is crowded with people. There is no war news. • [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washington, Dec. 1,1802. The President’s message is spoken of on all hands as the ablest written and best considered ol any he has submitted. Radical Republicans arc not particularly well pleased with his lengthy argument in favor cf compensated emancipation, but secession sympathizers are far worse pleased with the quiet way in which he treats the emancipation proclamation as a thing accomplished and with which Congress has nothing to do. It will, command much attention. Vallandigham & Co.’s demonstration on ar rests before the'message was brought in, is re garded as the key-note of their policy for the rgslou. Rumors of fighting at Fredericksburg are iu circulation, but doubtless are exceedingly unreliable. The following surgeons arc dismissed by the President for absence without leave; D, B, Dorsey, Sd Virginia; Assistant Sur geons—T. E. Conant, 3d Wisconsin; Seely. 16th Michigan; S. Ford, 2d Virginia; C. M. Furled! and Z. A. North, 0:h Ohio; D. J. Caldwell, 74ih Ohio. | The medical examining board nowin ses sion at St. Louis, is ordered dissolved and a new one with similar powers ordered to assemble at Louisville. Col. A. Moher of the 2Sth Ohio, and Col. V» m. XL Lytle of the lOxh Ohio, are appoint ed Brigadier Generals. Brig. Gen. Hart- Eufi of Michigan, so well known to all West ern men-in connection with Gen. campaigns in Western Virginia, and distin guished at South Mountain, is appointed to a Maior Generalship. Men begin to tsik about strange omissions in the Preeidccl’s mtsssage. First that il scarcely recommends anything save with re ft-rcnce to compensated emancipation, which is taken as an indication that the President has Lad taough of Congressional legislation during the progress 0! the war. The friends o£ the bankrupt bill are particularly surprised as the absence of a recoin men nation lor that; measure. The severest criticism on the mes- sage, among the friends of the Administra tion, is tliHi it is more remarkable for what it dots not.contain than for what it does con tain. All concede it a more than usual ability. The following is a synopsis of the Presi dent’s Message: OUU roIIEIGN 

BCLATIOXS. lie says the correspondence tonchirg for eign afi ijr?, wuic.ii juis taken plnce during tae latt year, is herewith submitce.l ia compli ance with request to that elicct. If the con didonol our relations with other nations is le:-? gratifying than formerly, it is certainly innre Eatislactory than a nation so unhappily U'slrr.cied might have reasonably apprehend ed. A blockade of 8.000 miles of sea coast could not. be cstabbslicdap.il vigorously ea icreed, in a season of great commercial activ ity like the present, without committing occasional mistakes and iuiiiciiag uuuintei? Injuries upon fvreign nut fobs aad sub jects. In clear cases ol taese kinds I have, eo far as possible, heaid ami redressed com plaints by friendly powers. There is, how ever, huge and ungmemingnumbers ot doubt lu: cases upon which the. government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection “is demanded by the claim ants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs from the naval or military au thorities of foreign nations, which the gov ernment cl these States are noc at once pre pared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States interested, a mutual • convention to examine and adjust some cam plaints. Tfcis has been made especially to Great Britain, France, Spain and Prussia. * In each case it has been Kindly received, but hot yet formally adopted. AFRICAN EMIGRATION. Applications Lave been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to lavof fbeir emigration with a view to such colonization, as was contemplated in recent cels of Congress. Ollier parties at home and abroad, some from interested and other mo tives, have suggcstedgsimilar measures, while on the ether hand, several of the Spanish American Republics have protested against the sending oi such colonies to their respec tive Territories. Undfer these oireamstances I have declined to move any such colony to any State without first obtaining the consent of its government, with an agreement on its part to r» coive and protect such emigrants in all taei/J rights as freemen, and I nave at the same time offered to the several States situa ted in the Tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the volun tary emigration of persons of that class to Ibvir respective territories upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia and Hayli are yet the only coun tries to which colonist;, of African descent, from hue could go with the certainty of being received and adopted as citiz ns, and I regret to tay that such persons, contemplating colo- Lb.nlion, do not seem, so willing to emigrate to these countries as to some others—nor bo willing as I think their interest demands. I believe, however, that the opinion is improv ing, and that ere long there will be an aug mented end considerable emigration to both these countries. - RELATIONS WTTII MEXICO. Our relctions with European States remain undisturbed, and with the States of our con tim-ut have improved, especially iluxico, Ct&ia Rica, &c. SUNDRY SCIENTIFIC MEASURES, The President says he favors the project of an Atlantic telegraph, and of extending the Pacific line to connect wiihthatbeingcxtend ed across the Russian Empire. He thinks the mineral resources of the Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues. It is worth}- of serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to pro mote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggests Its ell as most likely to be ef fective is a scientific exploration. THE WAR 

EXPENDITURE, The vast expenditures incident t* the mili tary and naval operations required lor the sup pression of the rebellion have hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the Increased dia tvurfcemcnts madeneccssary, demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue. The suspension of specie payment by the banks made large issues 01 United Slates notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfaction 01 o*her just demands be so economically or as well provided for. It is fxtremcly doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes payable in coin, and suffi ciently large for the wants of the people, can be permanently, usefully and'safely main tained, Is there any other mode in which the , necessary provision for the public wants can be made, and the great advantage of a safe and uniform currency secured ? A GENERAL BASEKG PROJECT. I know of none which promises so certain results, and at the same time, is so unobjec tionable as the organization of Banking Asso ciations, under a general act ol Congress, well guarded in its provisions. To such Associa tions, the government migHUfurnish circula ting notes on the security of United Slates bonds, deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervisions of proper of ficers, being unlformjn appearance mid secu rity, and always into com, would at once protect labor against the evils of I, cions currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe exchanges.. m *• A moderate reservation from the interest on. the bonds would compensate the UnitedStatea for the preparation and distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the system and wonld lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as security.. The public credit moreover would be greatly im proved.and the negotiation of newfloans great ly facilitated by the steady market dem an d for government bonds, which the adoption ot the proposed system would create. Itis an addi tional recommendation ot the measure, of considerable weight in my judgment, that it would reconcile as far as possible, existing in teieets by the opportunity offered to existing institutions to reorganize under the act sub stituting only the secured, uniform, natural circulation for the local and various circula tions now issued* TILE PUBLIC REPORTS. The President then gives a summary from the Secretary of the Treasures report, and refers to the reports of the-Secretary of the CHICAGO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1%2. and War, and says, though, lengthy, tbeae are only brief abstracts. He says there is a decided improvement In the fi parietal con dition of the Post Office Department com pared with preceding years. The Secretary of tbe Interior reports that public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. Speaking ot Indian affairs and the recent troubles, lie says: “I ‘submit for yeur special consideration whether our Indian system shall rot be remodeled. He then remarks at length on the diffi culty of making any national boundary iim*. 

AMENDING ins CONSTITUTION'. He then suggests amendments to the Con stitution, Congress concurring, to be propos ed to the Legislatures or conventions of the several States, which, if ratified by three fourths of said Legislatures, are to be valid as parts of the said Constitution, The first aiticle proposes that all States abolishing slavery before January Ist 1900 shall receive compensation from the United States. Tne second provides that all slaves freed by tbe chances ot war any time before the end of the rebellion shall be forever free, but all owners who had not been disloyal shall be compensated. The third provides that Congress may ap propriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons, with their consent, at any place without the United States. The President discusses these articles at seme length, and asks, “If thus, for a com mon object, slave property is to be sacrificed, i» it not just it be done at a common charge? And if with less money, or money more easily paid, we [can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means thin we can by the war alone, is it not economical to do it ? The pro posed emancipation would shorten this war, perpetuate peace, insnre the increase iauop ulation and proportionably the wealth of“ the country. THE WAH NOT TO 

WAIT FOB IT. The President then says the plan consist ing of these articles is recommended not bat that a restoration of the national authority ■would he accepted without its adoption. INor will the war, or the proceedings under the proclamation of September 22d, be stay ed, because of the recommendation of this plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration and thereby stay belli. And notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress pro- Tide by law for compensating any State which may adopt the emancipation before this plan snail have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. This plan is herebyl recommended! as a means, not in con clusion of, bnt additional to all others for re storing and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is pre sented exclusively in Us economical aspect. The plau is proposed as a permanent constitu tional law. 

I’ACIZFXC EAJLUOAD AND ILLINOIS SHIP canal. He suggests the earliest completion of the Pacific Railroad, also favorable action in Coa ertes on projects lor enlarging great canals in Kew York, Illinois and Michigan. COAIi'ENSATEB EMANCIPATION. The President refers to his Compensated Emancipation Proclamation of Sept. 23d. Ho says that a portion of the earth occupied by the people of the United States is well adap ted to be the home cf one national family, but not for two or more. In my inaugural address I briefly painted out the total inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy for differences be tween the people Of two sections. I did so ia language which I canjiot improve. Physically speaking, we cannot separate, we cannot re move cur respective sections from, each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. In conclusion, the President says the dog mas of the quiet past arc inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion ia piled high wiih difficulty and we must rise with the oc casion. The fiery trial through which we piss w-:l light us down in honor or dishonor to the Ihtffci- generation. We sny that we are for the Union, The world, will not forget that while we say this, we do know how to save the Union. In giving freedom to the slave ire amtrcfruiSom to the fne t \ honorabUalike, in vTint we ftivc <i»d what we waive. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last, bust hope of the earth. Other means may succeed; this could not foil. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just—a way which, it followed, the world will forever applaud, snd God must forever bless. the wab m vigem m 

GHAKSE BEFORE FREDERICKS- BURG. From Gen. Slgel's Command.

Cit anth.lt, Va., Not, 30, 7*p. m.—Brigadier General Stahl has just returned. He attacked the enemy at Snicker’s Ferry, and followed them with SCO cavalry into their camps on the other side of the river, and near Bcrryyille. Our men charged splendidly whenever they met the enemy. White’s cavalry was driven in all directions, nearly all th*ir officers cap tured, and their colors taken. White himself lied and hid in a house in Berryville. The S3, 7th and 12th Virginia cavalry were also attacked and routed, and forty of thslr men, with their horses,. were taken and fifty killed and wounded, and two colors taken. One wagon load of pistols and carbines was picked up on the road, thrown away by the Hying enemy. Eighty cattle and eighty horses were also brought in. Our loss in killed and wounded is shout fifteen. Gen. Stahl reports there is a brigade under Gen. Jones at Winchester, but that Jackson’s main force was at New Market last Wednesday, as reported previously. (Signed,) F. Sigel, Major Gen. New York, Dec. L—A J&rald special, dated headquarters army of the Potomac, Nov. 30, says; Considerable excitement has been occasion ed by the circulation of a report here, that a X-roposition has bedn made by the rebels for an armistice of thirty days, and that Lea was already in Washington arranging terms of the agreement. No credence is put in this ru mor, however. The rebels are working with redoubled vigor on their fortification?, and their cavalry of late have been very active, and have cap ita ed a number of our pickets along the fords of the river, besides two companies of the 31 Pennsylvania cavalry at Harwood Church.

J The railroad from Aquia Creek was com pleted yesterday, and a locomotive cime down this morning. Supplies will be received by tail henceforward. A little more than a week ago Lieut. Col. Pettes, of the 50th New York (engineer brigade), landed at this place from a bark, with 120 men of his command, to re pair the railroad, rebuild the wharf, &c. On the previous day a small body of rebel par tisan cavalr/ had paid us a flying visit, strik ing terror to the hearts of a number of con trabands who Lad concentrated here to obtain transportation to a land of freedom. Colonel Pettes found the place desolate and dreary, bearing only the vestiges of the recent con flagration. Not knowing how near or in what force the rebels might be, CoL Pettes posted his pickets and placed the rest of hitmen in side the mined walls of the engine house, to prevent a night attack. On Tuesday he sent cut reconnoitering parties, and during the day was visited by a detachment of New Jer sey cavalry. Previous to leaving Washington CoL Pettes had dispatched a pontoon and Occoquau ter use on When the train arrived at the latter place the. roads had become impracticable from gtj rains acA the mud, and the pontooiLbrielP werehfcere transferred from land tdSpKerfand 4bE|Khcnce to Bell Plain, the nePßst land transporting point to Fredericksburg. On Tuesday Mr. Wright and a corps of mecJamics drived, and assisted by the engineer corps under CoL Pettes, immediately commenced wharfleg, bridging, find repairing the railroad. The wharf and the bridge near Brook’s Station were completed, and the telegraph corps uu- Mr. McCandleas had extended their wires ■To Ibis point, connecting the line with the headquarters of Major Gen. Bnmside and his grand division commanders. * «The corresondent of the New York Tribune writes what has been done at Aqnia Greek in a week’s time. Thousands of tonsot army supplies have been landed in barges and floats, under Cspt, Halh Assistant Quartermaster, IT. S. A., and forwarded hence to different points. Extensive frame warehouses ‘ are now being erected, and a locomotive with strain of plat form care was landed on Friday, and made a trip down the road this evening. All these operations were protected by the presence of three gunboats and a mortar schooner. In sevtn days’ time, this place, recently bo desolate, is now.as densely populated and pre sents as active an appearance as the river side of a populous city. ' The bridge over the Potomac Creek is now tbe only obstacle to steam communication ■with the headquarters of the army opposite Fredericksburg, and this will! bs removed within tbe next forty-eight hours. The al most impassable stateof the roads from Aquia Creek and Bell Plain renders this connection Imperatively necessary for the transportation ot army supplies. Almost every farm-house for miles around has been deserted by its oc cupants, who evidently fled southward on the approach of Maj. Gen. Burnside’s army, leav ing in most cases their flocks and herds be hind, which naturally fall to the* 41 tender mer cies” of our soldiers. f - ~ Lamb, mutton, beef, veal, pork and poultry, consequently, are abundant and 1 - 1 cheap,” and. form staple di-hes on the rude- tables of the camp. THE SITUATION BEFORE FREDERICKS BURG. [Washington Cor. Cincinnati Commercial.] The contending armies being now brought face to face, the question arises, whether they will fight a decisive battie from their present positions. Symptoms of both aggressive in tentions on the part of General Burnside, and of a disposition for a rigorous defence of Fred ericksburg on that of the enemy, are manifest. It is evident that the issue lice with General Burnside, and that he either considera hlm selt unable or unwilling to open It immedi diately. If he was ready for an attack, It would he difficult to discern a reason for its postponement, as every hour strengthens the enemy’s means of defense. From what I know of the condition of bis army, I am sat isfied that he is not ready for any offensive demonstrations, and he will not. he until the railroad from Aquia Creek isdu-running or der and has satisfied his various wants,“and that no stirring news will reach the public from the Rappahannock before the end ot the present week, if then. The need of our ar tillery against the rebel at least, will' not be commenced until th«-re ila certa nty- of a ready replenishment of the ammunition to be expended. < * •. Upon the whole, public expectation, here raised so high at tbe lime Burnside went from Warrenton, is now much less, hopeful than a week ago. Nor has the general confidence lu tbe state of matters on the Raupalianuock been strengthened by the intelligence, spread through the city yesterday afternoon, that the Preeiaent had undertaken another of his omi nous viciis to the army. Doleful accounts continue to reach ua as to the hardships endured by Burnside's soldiers Ircra the continued cold, wet. weatherand the already-mentioned shortness of provisions and forage. Information of the most positive cbcracter has revealed the fact of intense suf- ftriug in General Burnside’s command, by both man and beast,.from the want of supplies. from mm m brio#. 

SITES AKD FLOTILLA MATTERS, 'The Gunboat Lexington in a [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.} Cairo, Dec. 1,1852. I have later intelligence’ from Helena, brought by the steamer V. F. Wilson la-.t night. Gen. Hovey made another movement from Helena down the Mississippi with bu troops on the 27th ulfc. His destination is said to be lower down than the mouth of ■White River, where the last recjnaoissanci ended. A portion of Porter’s fleet is now rcsliug at Helena. Three steamers are at the mouth of White River, a few at the mouth of the Yazoo and more between there and Vicksburg. The water iu the Yazoo River is rising, and is now higher than that iu the Mississippi, Boats drawing eight leet of water cannot cross the bar at Helena; hence a rise must take place before the remainder of the fleet can go down. High water iu the Yazoo may give the rebel gunboats lately completed a chance to" come down and attack the few gunboats we have in that vicinity. Should they do so, some hard fighting may be expected. The wooden United States steamer Lexing ton had a brush with tfab rebels at a planta tion in Arkansas, twenty miles south of Helena, last Tuesday. She was coming up near the shore when a volley was fin d upon her hy ICO rebels. This was fol lowed by discharges from light cannon. The wood work of the Lexington was pierced in a hundred places. ent. Shirk hove to, and replied with his heavy guss so effectively that in a few minutes the confederates scattered,’carrying off their dead and wounded and? their cannon, hue leaving behind them twenty-two negroes and sixteen hales of cotton, all of which Capt. Shirk brought to Helena in safety. The cot ton came to Cairo in the steamer Wiison. The Lexington lost none of her ere w, bat suf fered in her hull and npper works from mus ket and heavy shot. Fortunately none of the latter struck her steam boilers and pipes. Sue still lies at Helena undergoing repairs. Hear Admiral Porter has pronounced the gunboat Eastporfc unaeaworthy, and is to be immeadiatcly put out of commission, and her officers and crew placed on some more effec tive craft. The fault of the Eastporb is want of strength ia the keel, suffering from broken back fro'm weight of metal she is compelled to carry. "Whether she can be repaired and ren dered seaworthy remains to be tested. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.! Cairo, Dec. 1,1502. Papers from Memphis of Saturday, the29:h mst, came to hand to-day. The only items of interest contained in them are accounts of the burning of Germantown and the sinking of the steamer Blackhawk near Helena, by colliding with the steamer White Cloud. The destruction of Germantown took place on Thursday. The news of the eveut was doubt ed in Memphis when first received, but the Bulletin says it has positive information cor roborating the first reports. The paper pub lishes no particulars, but exculpates the Union officers from all participation in the act. It says neither Gene. Grant or Sherman can he teid responsible; but who maybe responsi ble the editor does not explain. Germantown is on the Memphis and Ohio railroad, about thirty miles from Memphis. It has for a long lime been the resort of guerillas and cotton burners, and was a place of no great import ance in a commercial or business point of view, but merely a Stirling little station on the railroad. Cairo, Dec.l.—l have just conversed with a gentleman who accompanied Gen. Sherman’s division twenty-two miles from Memphis At last accounts it was beyond Cold Water. The roads are very good and the troops in fine spirits. On Friday eight guerillas dashed on the rear of the army and captured Sergeant Walker, oth Missouri, Captain Hart, Bth Missouri, and two privates of company L Just as the rebels were about to march them off to Germantown, four privates, stragglers of the Missouri regimcnt v came np, charged on the secesh, dispersed them, released the prisoners and captured a team. I have important information from the expe dition which has left Helena, but cannot send it. Everything in the Southwest looks cheering. If the rebels attempt to make a stand, they will be literally demolished. Cairo, Dec. 1. —Memphis is much excited ia consequence of the construction put upon Gen. Grant’s general order No. S, which is un derstood to mean that before anything can be bought to either eat or drink, the purchasers c.usitake the oath of allegiance. It goes into effect on the loth of December. A report is current in Memphis that Ger mantown was burned by soldiers belonging to the Si Missouri, while Gen. Sherman’s di vision was near that town, and that General Smith had the offenders arrested and shot. All teams in the country passed over by Gen. Sherman’s army, have been pressed into transportation service. On Friday night, near President’s Island, the steamer Black Hawk, from Memphis to Helena, collided with the np bound boat While Cloud. The Black Hawk was badly damaged, and, after floating some distance, sunk. Three negroes were lost. The rest on board escaped. She was valued at $5,000, and -is n total loss to her owner. MUiereis a band of organized robbers on the ro!ro leading from Memphis. On the 2Sth they robbeda citizen, Ebj ah Brooks, of $l,lOO. Gen. Sherman, at last accounts, was beyond Coldwater. The Dome of the Capitol* The magnificent dome of the capitol, de signed by Thos. W. Walter, and now in course of construction under his direction, is rapidly progressing to completion. The principal frame has been completed, the ribs put in place, and tbe outer plating is being finished. After this is done, nothing will be left to complete the exterior of the dome but the construction of the lantern and the placing of the ornaments on the upper windows and around the spring of the cupola. Tne cast ings for the inner dome are in course of pre paration, and will soon be ready. The bight of tbe iron work above the basement, includ-j ing the statue, will be 285 feet- The whole quantity, of iron received from the beginning of the work up to the present time was about 7,500.000 pounds, and 800,000 more will be needed. The dome will be crowned with Crawford’s gigantic and imposing statue of freedom, which is nineteen and a half feet high, and weighs.ls,ooo pounds. The entire cost ot the statue wa5.525,000. The cost of the dome and statue together, when com pleted, will be about §900,000.

Farther advices from Nashville give fuller details of CoL Kirk’s skirmish at Lavergue on the 27th. Gen. Sill directed Col. Kirk, commanding the sth brigade, to reconnoitre towards Lavergne to-day. His command con sisted of that portion ot his bri-rade out on f icket duty, with two companies of the 3d ndiana cavalry. They came upon rebel cav alry outposts less than a milebeyondScrosgs villo, and after a few shots they fell hack. 'The other rebel cavalry outposts fell back and con centrated a mile in the rear, where they fired several rounds on onr advance, and wounded Lieut. Col. Hurd of the 30th Indiana, who was bravely leading his men. His right, un der Col. Hodge, drove back the enemy to their battery on a hill, but misunderstanding an order to charge and take the battery, they got too far to the left, and the enemy fired a 'dozen shots and retreated. They were pursued a mile beyond Lavergne. None of our men were killed, but eleven were wounded, including Lleufc. CoL Hurd, three men of the cavalry, one man of the artillery, two of the 29th Indiana, one in the 79Eh Illi nois, three in the 30th Indiana, anc one In the 34th Illinois. The rebel loss was supposed to have been the severest, from the sanguinary indications, but they carried oft their killed and wounded. Their General (Wheeler) was wounded, and we got three prisoners. Their forces congested of cavalry and artillery. Stewart’s brigade was five miles behind La vergne. Wheeler commands six regiments. The firing was quite heavy on both sides. There was also heavy firing In. front of Sheridan’s division on the Nolinsvflle pike, amounting to nothing. CoL Roberts of the 42d Illinois, also captured a rebel captain, some men and guns, and secesh correspon dence, on the Charlotte pike. The enemy evinces a disposition to fight this side Mur freesboro, but have not been fortifying. The best information places their force at 50,000 men. THE SITUATION BELOW NASHVILLE.

The rebel authorities have ordered Bragg to contest every foot of ground in Middle Tennessee, from Murfreesboro south. Taeir demonstrations seem to sustain this’report. At Murfreesboro they have mounted "four heavy siege guns, in the works constructed by Gen Nelson, but they do not seem to be adding to their defenses.
