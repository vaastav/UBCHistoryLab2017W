Monument to the Maryland Pilgrims. —Aa the 25th of March. 1884, wilt ba tha 250th an oi Ternary of tbtlMtn* of I WMaryt**l Pilgrims at tit. Mary'*, it ia proposed in Balti more circlee to prospect for fund* to erect a monnateot io that city to com memorate the act. It was contem plated originally, it aeenM, to locate the monument el or near tba spot in ibia county vrliera the Pilgrims ac tually landed, bat Baltimore, we learn, baa now been substituted, and it ia in that city that tba proposed meioment in lo be ereoted. It im premm us as quite an original idea to erect a monument lo perpetuate the memory of en act an hundred or more milts distent from the place where it occurred and in preference to the piece ittelf. Bt. Mary’s rirer is indeed remote from the centres of ' population, but that it is difficult of 'I come, we deny, and cite the Cheas |ake, tba Potomac and St. Mary’s , river as evidence of the fact. Our local feeling may somewhat warp oar judgment, but we certainly think that a monument to commemorate the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers would devalop deeper feeling*, and ba more appropriate and impressive, if located on the banka of tbo tic. Mary’s- than at any other point in the State. Tub President's Message.— The meaiMga of President Arthur was sent to Congress on Tuaaday of last week. It ia unpartizan, of readable length, plain apoken "sufficiently compreben ahre, and to the point. Among its recommendations ia one that prompt a tops should be taken to construct an interior coast line of defence by wa ter ways acrom the peninsula of Flori da. along the coast of Florida to Hamp ton Honda, between the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware river and through Capa God. The President opposes any redaction in the revenues of the government He recommends that the rejected trade dollar be taken by themintaanddspositorieeaabullion at slight discount upon silver. Tl a Sec tetary of the Treasury proposes that the trade dollar, he exchanged for the legal tender dollar, dollar for dollar, and he I hns driven from circu lation. The President wants $60,- I*oo,ooo taken from thg surplus in the treasury to rehabilitate the navy. He does not look with favor upon the proposed postal telegraph. He in vitee Congrnm to extend educational facilities in portions of the country where gient illiteracy exists. He wants Congress to rejeal the act mak ing Utah a territory and to assume control over the Mormons by means of a Commission to blot oat polygamy. He recommends that Congress should paas laws to protect people from the injustice practiced by railway corpo rations in freight charges and closes his message by suggesting to Congress the passage of a new Civil righte bill gnaranteeiag colored people the rights which were intended to be secured them by the 14th Amendment. Though wide differences of opinion undoubtedly exist as to tba merits of some of the President's suggestions, none of them have yet been assailed by the democratic pram either in a hostile or captious spirit. —a—— "TrilK Alewife. —la tha Easton Jjedgcr, of late date, appears as en tertaiaing article on “The Fish called Alewife.” As oar people are inter ested ia anything that pertains to tha fish, wa reproduce parts of it, pre miaiag, that a few years ago, a news paper article on this alewife would have occasioned the remark, that the writer was hard poshed for a subject. Than, although the good qualities of the alewife as a manure wee well knows la tide water farmers, it had not begun to be worked op as a com mercial fertiliser, and a large ‘school" of thane hah was not, ns now, a rare sight m our waters. The common alewife has bow become a tish of liter ature, and “grave writers are search ing his haunts, _ investigating his habits, following with the pen bis pursuers, and writing him up gener ally from his cradle in the great deep to his grave as a fertiliser in the fox mom* field*’* The ioWper goea on to say; “Ale wife our fecund fish is celled ia the Dataware sad Chase yaks bays, (cor rupted into old-wife by the fishermen,) I mt hie adtnliflc name ia Breuomiia Tj/rtmmu. la Virginia he become* ‘qreen-lari’ and ‘hagd**,’ and fur > bee south ‘del hash;’ while in Main! Ids name is ‘pogy.’ in Massachusetts d Comiaciicut *!Bmhades,' end In New York and New Jersey, 'mom kaehar.’ .*■ w* 7* devil cnee tech the shape of an alewife or aosabuaher when he aaiaad Antony Van Coilaor, the tram Wer. • v-laird in Knickerbocker's history of New York. 44 ‘lt was a dark and stormy night , ■■ I . I 11 Lf! 1 1 .■ when the good Antony arrived at the creak, sagelv denominated Harlem River, which separates Manhattan from the mainland. The wind wa* high, the elements in pm uproar sod no Charon could be found to ferry the adventurous sounder of brass across the water. For a short time he re posed like an impatient ghost upon the brink, and thtfh, bethinking him self of the urgency of hi* errand, took a hearty embrace of his atone bottle, swoie most valorously that he would swim acrom in spite of tha dayjl, and daringly plunged into tha chasm. An old Dutch burgher, famed for his ver acity, averred t hat he saw the day vai in the shape of a huge moes-bunker, tries the sturdy Antony by the leg apdf drag him beneath the wave* Nobody ever attempts to swim across the river after dark; Mid as to the moee-bankers, they are bald in such abhorrence that no good Dutchman will admit them to hia table who loves good fish tnd hates the devil.* “The alewife is now serving a more practical purpose than lending hip aelf to the writers of ihsse old tradi tions. The range of Ibis fish extends from the Bey of Fnndy to tbo St. John’s river, Florida, aod all down this coast line there are fish factories where the menhaden are worked np into oil and qpmmercial fertilisers, am) from the fiffit of April Uktbe firaf of November thousands of men are at work catching the fish by the millions. Tha trade report for 1881, for instance, places the alewife catch at 454,192,- 000 fish. A vast amount of capital ia invested in this industry- There have been fears that the menhaden schools would be destroyed bv the progrees of this industry, and* with their disappearance from our coast, beya and rivers, would disappear also those fish, notably the tailor or blue fish, which feed upon the alewife; bat this is not likely to happen, at least foi yean to coma, u the fecundity of the alewife is wonderful. Some au thorities say that two millions of eggs have been taken from a single fish. The number used, or that can be used, by the factories, is a very small frac tion of the immense number that •warm on the Atlantic coast, within tba limits above named every season; and a not much larger fraction of the number destroyed by other fish every year. Professor Baird, a recognized authority on all fish subjects, esti mates that tan thousand millions of •lewivea are deatroved daily by blue fish alone during the seraou of four months on tba New England coast; •ad Profeasor Goode, reasoning upon Professor Baird's data, concludes that in tha whole range of the ale-wife and in tba season of six months three thousand billions of alewives are an nually destroyed." [Communicated. Washington. D. C., Dec. 8. ’BB. Mweru. Editors:—ln perusing the interesting columns of the Beacon of the 6(h inri., we see that our odorif erous friend, “H. B.,’’ (which is “Hot Box' ) has again fallen into error— this time by accusing usof havingsug rd “the removal of the present i which is postmaster) at Bt. Clem ent's Bay. We simply called atten tion to a communication published in the Enterprise, in which the writer (not we) suggested a change in that office because of alleged irregularities and pious mismanagement of the pre sent incumbent. But seeing the bat tering requirements named for a more suitable "r, Mv’ (which is postmaster) we did think we would taka time by the fore-lock, as "they" say, in behalf of that suffering community, and es pecially in the interest of THE “gen tleman" who, abova all others of our limited acquaintance in that “delive ry," seemed so admirably qualified to fill the bill, thinking, of course, that the influence of our “more fortunate iierternity," as his old and familiar 'friend, would be acceptable and suf ficient in accomplishing the change suggested by that aggrieved corres pondent. We had, and have, no pre judice against the present “honest, competent aod trustworthy" P. M. at that office (the complaint referred to teemed lo be based upon the fact that there was a superabundance of these good qualities exercised there, especi ally on JSkmdoye) and while we nave not the pleasure of his personal ac quaintance, we are persuaded that he nor the many other postmasters pos sessed of the same commendable vir tues Mid resident of the county will not feel over flattered at tha easy and pleasing (to H. B.) “requisites for a firat-ol&as postmaster" which he deems so essential, via.; “no conscience, plen ty of bran and little sense," in the first of which, at least, H. B. seems to abound. Indeed, neither may they feel much complimented by hia mod est disclaimer of having “fallen so low" as lo apply for or accept an of fice—even a poatoffioe—at the hands of the present regime; and it ia to ba hoped tha t these gentlemen in your county who have so long and faith fully occupied offices under “the pre sent regime'* will not ba so regardless of the public good, under a sense of •elf-reapect, as to resign because, for sooth, through the kind information of H. 8., they may suddenly discover their sad and fallen estate. Oh! H. 8., H. 8., thou odoriferous “Hot Box." don’t be an sensitive in your nobler feelings, nor ao very fastidious with your offi cial aaeociatioas! And for the public weal, do not bo so reckless ia your pleasing sad bock-handed compli ments lo your “honest and trustwor thy" neighbors. Aod should you ever fail ao low aa to apply for an of fice at tha “sticky hands ’ of the pre sent regime, (and you may yet ia this particular oaaa, it wan the offioe rath er sashing the man.) don't you know. H. 8.. that the recommendation of “a gee llamas." while t>eiag*meoh mors difficult tor you to obtain, would not ba aa potent and appropriate, ia your oaaa, aa the power and influence of our “more fortunate paternity," who ia an much batter qualified lo rightly appreciate and more clearly represent your charming qualities and fitness for office under the present or any "other regime f While recognizing the bopfelMMHW* of onr chance in a com petition with you. H. 8., under tha *oi* requirement named in tha origi nal proposition. yat it would afford on great pleasure to accept the appoint ment, io case of a vacancy, with the •seared “emoluments" appertaining thereto; but at present we have other more pleasing engagements closer io “headquarters. ’ where the coveted op portunities “to capture the letters and appropriate their content#" are more fnqneot wed remunerative. And be ing a non-resident of that “delivery,” we are not eligible to tha position ao kindly tendered; besides, wa don’t think wa can measure up to the spe cifications aa well aa yourself (which is manifest) for it ia not so much the “fear of the devil”—even your “hon est" one—that would prompt us to ba “honest and trustworthy" in tha dis charge of onr duties, either private or official, as it would baa regard for ths commands of Him. who save, “Thou shalt not bear false witness," (Exodus, xx-16) to which we have before vain !v called your neglected attention. By the way, H, 8., (which ia “Hoi Box") isn't it about time for “that particular letter’’ to torn up? Let us and the anxious public know when the disconsolate wanderer returns, either with or wilbont its “bard- or “ill-gotten hoard." Til! then, perchance, adieu. ' r s: b.

The reflect ing portion of their surviving fellow-citizens pay a just tribute to their character for useful ness and exemplary conduct, but who cau ful ly describe the lasting sorrow and affliction which the melancholy sepnmlioo caused in tba family circle in which they were so beloved nod honored. The death of Richard H. Reeder causes re flection (not upon the brevity of life, for be was well advanced ia years f luit upon the lust which n community suffers alien men such • he are taker, from them. I have fre quently len present when Mr. Reeder has been the subject of conversation, and all joined in the declaration that he was a man of most estimable cbarKCtsr. I know of no man more worthy of such ezpren-ioa. for he had many admirable traits. In my judgment, Mr. Ree der pasmreed the attributes of a perfect gen tleman. He was well educated, intelligent, well-informed, friendly, hospitable and with all. modest, engaging and of becoming man ners. Those who were intimate with him, I amine bis friends, and no one properly con stituted ron'd be bis enemy. Notwithstand ing the gentleness of his manners, there was a becoming spirit of independence in tbs main tenance of bis opinions, for reflection formed his com id ions, nod they guided him ia bis dur. Mr Reeder, although well qualified, never pspired to or sought public office—indeed, tba means by which public trusts have been at tained were repulsive to him. la such a po sition, however, be would hare given lo the public the benefit of a writ-informed mind a Ei*d judgment and a conscientious, honest art. The only public position lie ever oc cupied was one to which be was summoned by constituted authority as a worthy citizen The Jury has been hy some denomiaaltd ll e ptludinm of onr rights, and when we consid er the highly important duties nt a Juror, the designation appears to be deserved The lift, liberty, prosperity of the citizen and almost everything we value, as also the preven'ion of crime, generally come under the supervision of and are affected hy the verdict of a J ary ■ Reflection cannot but display the value'of good and faithful Jurymen. If there ever was amongst ns n Juror of more mine to the pub lic than Richard B. Reeder. I have not been able in a long practice nt the bar in oar Court to discover him. Juries made up of such men are invaluable. Mr. Reeder. I am informed and believe, lived and died a stacereand fisitlifn! Chris tian, nod was hopeful of a Blessed Home be yond ths grave, through tbs merits of bis Re deemer. This well bared hope no doubt min gles much comfort with the grief st their se pontioa of bis truly pious widow sod daugh ter, who dearly loved him, and to whom ho was a devoted husband nod lather. In Uiis brief testimonial of the worth of my dcnnrtad friend, I have said nothing bat what I bri&eve just and true, and I feel confi leot that those who knew Mr. Reader well wUI confirm my estimate of his character.
