The tic outs from General Wads worth's brigade, which havo been scouring the country since Friday last, report that Flint llill and Fairfax Court House are entirely abandoned by the rebels. The government, it is said, is contemplating a general exchange of prisoners with the rebels, in order to release the officers and soldiers of the Union army from the miseries which they are suf. ferir.g in tlieir Southern prisons. Such a measure will bring consolation to many a Northern fireside We give to-day some further details of the pro ceedings of the privateer Sumter, which we have beforo reported at Martinique. It appears that sho had captured two American vessels? the brigs Joseph Pa As and Daniel Trowbridge ? destroying the latter vessel by fire and taking her crew to Tort Royal, Martinique. We have before men tioned the fact that the United States gnnboat Iroquois had started in pursuit of the privateer. Our news to-day comes from the British Hchooner Emellnc, which arrived here yesterday from Port i P.oyal, where she left the Sumter taking in coal. General Banks has taken up bis winter quarters at Frederick, Md. He was received there with great apparent enthusiasm by the inhabitants, and located himself in the residence of Colonel Bradley J. Johnson, of the rebel army. There are no signs of the rebels between Harpcr'B Ferry and | Point of Rocks, where Colonel Geary's command fn keeping a vigilant lookout for them. | The effect of the President's Message, and his modification of Secretary Comeron's report rela tlvo to the disposition of the slaves in the South. Is said to have been very marked in KentucKy. It lias given conlidcnce and strength to the Union men? a fact which is indicative of a'like result all over the South, if the administration confine them, selves to -preserving the integrity of the Union and maintaining the constitution and the laws as the object of the war in spite of the factious opponi tion of the abolitionist traitors, who are urgiiig them to a different course. The \frica, at this port yesterday, brought im portant advices concerning the aspect of Ame rican aiTuirs in Europe on the 24th ultimo. Our news columns contain full details of the arrival of the rebel steamer Nashville, Commander Pegram, at Southampton, England, on the 21st of Novem ber, as well as tke announcement of the fact that she was duly received by the authorities as a war vessel commissioned for a.special service by a bel ligerent Power. Captain Pegram himself pub 'it'.ied the particulars of the overhauling and de eti uction of the ship Harvey Birch, near the mouth of the British channel, exhibited his commission from Jefferson Davis and gave up the captain and crew of the IFarveJ' Birch immediately to the charge of the United States Consul in Southampton. Such of the crew ol the Harvey Birch as refused to make n declaration not to attempt any violence on board the Nashville were put in irons by Captain I'e gram. Captain Nelson, the commander of the Harvey Birch, had published a protest in the English papers against the acts of the rebel officers. Mr. Peyton, a rebel Commissioner to Europe, and his wife, were landed from the Nash ville, and had, with Captains Pegram and Nelson, gone to London? the Urst named parties to com miuneatc with Mr. Yancey, and Captain Nel son to see Mr. Adams. The afJUir produced intense excitement in the commercial, flxian. clol and political circles of England, but the impression seemed to be general in favor of shel tering the Nashville for refit and supplies, ju.-t as the Union vessel James Adger had been treated a fow days previously. Rumors were afloat that the Adger had gone out with the intention of forcibly taking Messrs. Mason and Slidell from the British mail steamer, even in an English port, and the Edinburgh Scotsman, a reliable journal, asserts that tli. law officers of England had decided that United States officials had a perfect and Iegaj right to seize a mail steamer knowingly conveying euch contrabands, even in the harbors of (Jreat Britain. The case would, it was thought, be taken into the courts for argument. It was also stated that a British Admiralty Council, which was at tended by the leading members of the Cabinet had been held on the subject. The steamship Arngo, with General Scott on tioard, reached Southampton from New York on the 23d ultimo, in the afternoon?a fact which of course disminsoH at once all the rumors of h> r cap tnre by the rebels. Lord Stanly, in a speech to hi? constituents, said it was not reasonable to blame the federal go ver ante ut for not doing that which, as trustees for the people, they hardly could do, and which no government since the world began hud ever done ? for not giving up half their territory without a blow in its defence. The result of the struggle was beyond human calculation; but lie thought( sooner or later, a Southern confederacy would be established. Mr. Lnyard, Under Secretary of State for Fo reign Afii.irs, in a speech before hi* constituents, alluded at somo length to the American question' and defended the policy of the British government towards the United States. Mr. Bright was expected fully to enter upon the American question at the approaching banquet to be given him at Rochdale. It is asserted that the Commissioners of the Con federate Stales were only present at the late ban quet at Fishmongers llall as the guests of some individual member or members of the company. Deputations from the governments of Canada, New Brunswick and Novo Scotia had arrived in London for tho purpose of urging the imperial government to aid the construction of the pro. jected railway from Halifax to Quebec. One of the arguments is that the line will be a defence against the United States. Tho l.ondon Time* seems to think 1l1.1t some defence is needed. Tho allied expedition to Mexico was fairly afloat. It was feared in some quarters in England that tho event may lead to serious complications. Spain is to attack the fortress of San Juan d'Ulloa, at Vera Cruz. 

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. The Africa, from Liverpool the 23d and Queens town the 24th ultimo, arrived at this port yester day morning, with European news two days later thiin that brought by the North American to Fort land, and published in tho IIeiialu on Saturday morning. Consols closed in Loudon on the 23d ultimo at 93% a 94. The discount market was more easy, ami transactions were numerous at V/% per cent lor best bills. The London Aetra says that, owing to the afi'air of the Nashville, the recent inquiries for American securities had sub sided. The Bank of England bullion shows an increase in the week of ?351,092. Cotton remained steady, but quiet, in Liverpool. Occasional sales had taken place at a decline of J^'d. per pound in the lower qualities of American ; the better kinds, however, were less affected. Stock in port, 5Hf 00 bales, including 273,r>30 American. Quantity at sea, 105,000 balos, against 1H6,000 same time last year. Flour was slow but unchanged. The news of tho wreck of the North Briton had been received in England. The Italiau Parliament had been opened. The speech of the Prime Minis ter confirms the rumor of a failure at negotiation for reconciliation with Borne. The Emperor Na poleon was to have undertaken the mediation, but the indisposition of the l'ope to negotiate defeated the intention. Baron Ricasoli's pin u for reconcil ing the Catholic religion with politics w as tolerably broad. The Cardinals were to retain their dignity ar.d inviolability, and the Pontiff was to have full liberty guaranteed for his acts of divine right as chief of the church, lie was also acknowledged as u Prince of Italy. Ecclesiastical discipline was to be entirely confided to liim, and the King of Italy renounced his right in respect of benefices. The Italian government relinquished nil right of interference with the election of bishopH, and guaranteed his Holiness an adequate revenue. The rcmaiuder of the general news report is not of much importance. A member of tho Arkansas Legislature n?>? 1 thirty-five citizens of that State recently arrived at Rolla, Missouri, and joined t>?> Union forces under Colonel Phelps. They represent the people of the northern part Arkansas as being truly loyal, and that their seeming allegiance to the Southern confederacy is merely a pretence to rave themselves from secession mauraders. There are twenty thousand well disciplined and well armed and equipped troops now in the vicinity of Louisville, Kentucky, and more expected. The Graud Jury of Monmouth county, N. J., in session at Freehold, on Wednesday, found n true bill against Rudski, the person suspected of the murder of Sigisnnind Fcllner, in October last. The testimony of Mrs. Marks, the detectives who have worked up the case, and other persons before the Crand Jury, was of a most interesting character, and almost positively indicates Rud ski as the person who committed the deed. A full report of this case is given in our paper this morning. A man named Thomas A. Mcliill, residing at No. 202 First avenue, yesterday, in a fit of insani ty or intemperance, threw his own mother out of a fifth story window, killing lier instantly. The po lice immediately arrested the perpetrator of the dee d, an Irishman by birth, aged about thirty-one years. The deceased and her son had lived to gether peaceably about a year in the house, and bore the reputation of being sober, industrious people. The landlord states that when McCill paid hia rent on Friday last he appeared to br either insane or drunk, and that he had warned the mother to beware of him. A report of the case will be found elsewhere. An infamous scamp, calling himself S. C. Mosely, wa? yesterday arrested and locked up for endea voring to entice the daughter of a respectable citi zen, aged fourtocn years, from her home. The scoundrel, who i3 an elderly man, learned her name and residence by picking up her handker chief in church, and had written the child teveral letters (copies of which will be found in our report of the case), offering to meet her at the Museum and other places. The girl promptly handed the letters to her father, who had the fellow arrested. His case will come up before Justice Rrennan this morning. The schooner Richard A. Wood, ('apt . (.'rammer, arrived here yesterday from Alexandria, with a cargo of coal, having run the blockade of the Poto mac, during a suow storin, on the night of the 2d inst. Capt. Crammer had been detained seven weeks waiting for an opportunity to get away. '1 ho schooner Gazelle, ('apt. Ketchum, from Poi omoke river, al*o arrived yesterday, having a cargo of wood. This is the iirs! arrival from the Western Shore of Maryland for some months. The United States steam transport Albany, lying at pier No. 0 Noith river, is loading provisions and ammunition for Locust Point, and will sail to-day. The United States steam transport Admiral is lying at anchor in the North river, waiting orders The steamship City of Manchester anchored at Quarantine on Saturday evening, and sailed on Si nday morning, at nine o'clock, for Liverpool and Queen 4 town. The Long Island steamers, bound East, which were detained on Saturday by the fog. left yester day morning at live o'clock. TIio exports of breadstuff's from this port to Europe continue to increase, and last week reach ed the enormous amount of 1,463,106 bushels of grain and 86,111 barrels of flour. ; A vessel arrived at Boston on the 6th inst. from | (ionaives, with t'.fty fivo bags of cotton, grown on ! th'j bland of Huyti. I Ml OHTANT (ROM THE SotTtl ? DlSAKKECl'JOX j os Tin: Aiivam ? The South is portentous j with . igniflcnr.t ignsof di.snll'octlon with govern ? n><'ut and disorganization and demoralization in j the army. Our late uew3 from Southern pa pers enlightens us as to many fuels touching ttiis question. In North Carolina especially wo find that discontent among her soldiers is rife, and that in one case an oillcer, Colonel Siuglo tany, lias been court inartialed, broken of his command and pay fur two months and that lie has accordingly resigned liis commission, upon tlio ground that his regiment, which is now "considerably disaffected and demoralized, will hardly be worth commanding" at the expiration of two months. In addition to this, we have in formation showing that the people throughout the whole State of North Carolina are discon tented with (he despotism under which they chafe and groan, and are anxious to be rid of it. If the government, then, would givo them aid and comfort, protection, arms and alins, wo might soon see North Carolina wheeling into line with the other loyal States of the Union. Nor is it to North Carolina alone that the spirit of discontent is confined. We recoguise it at New Orleans, as developed in the lute "con spiracy" against the rebel government, it is manifested in Tennessee through the recent victory of 1'arnon Brownlow. We hear of it in Arkansas, in the intelligence which we publish to-day of the discovery of a secret organization against rebel despotism, which, it seems, has ramified through several counties. All these signs mark an approaching retrogression to the good old Union and the honored flag that has floated above it on laud and sea for three quar ters of a century; and if our government only avails itself, with vigor, of these signs of the times in the rebel States, the solution of our difficulty may be nearer at hand than we imagine. Important toy tlie AfrIfn?Tlw Cas? of Mason uiirt Slldel! Settled In Atlviince by tl?e Eiiglltb Government. The news received by the Africa, though not beuring directly on the affair of the Trent, is yet of a nature to dispel any uneasiness with regard to the course that the English government will pur.-ue in reference to it. The Edinburg Scots, man? an old established journal, and generally reliable in its statements ? hus a story which, if true, completely settles the Mason and Siidell difficulty. It says that on the arrival of the James Adger in Southampton, ostensibly for the purpose of refitting, the British government, having reason to suspect that the real object of her presence in British waters was the seizure of the West India mail steamer, then due, and, as it was supposed, with the rebel Commissioners on board, issued orders to the British war steamer Thrt ton to watch her movements and protect against her any vessel bearing the British flag. This assumption, we need not say, was entirely unfounded, us it is notorious thut the James Adger was Bent over to capture the Nashville; and, failing in that object., she has since returned home, and is now at Philadelphia. The British Foreign Office seems to have pro ceeded in this matter on the slightest possible evidence. A few clianco expressions that drop ped from some of the crew of the James Adger appear to have been the chief, if not tho only, ground for its action. After remaining a few days in port, attracted, a* the story runs, by the ' hospitalities of the placo ? a fact in itself suf ficient, one would think, to refute the suspicions entertained in regard to the object of hi* instruc tions ? the American captain put to sea, but, en countering a severe gale on the South coast, was forced anchor at (Jalshott. The mail steamer had in the meanwhile arrived a couple of days before her time- her captain, and no doubt the captu'in of the James Adger, both unconscious of the supposed hostile relations in which the aetivity of the rebel agent i in London had been placing them. The zeal of these latter has. however, been productive of a result which they had not cal" culated upon. The raisiug of a difficulty in the case of the James Adger has had the ettoct of prejudging that of tho Trent, and binding the British law officers by their own declara tions. It appears that in consequence of the facts above narrated a correspondence was opened between the authorities in Downing street and our Minister, Mr. Adams, in which the latter disclaimed, ns he well might do. all knowledge of the instructions allegi d to have been given to the former vessel. In the course of this correspondence it was ascertained to be the opinion of the British law officers that "Vc oording to the interpre'edion of the law, as laid down in former (hcliions. the relations of Great Britain to the Am, 'icon belligerents were perl taps such that there might lave beenfair legal grounds for the American cruiser sei-ing the mail ste.anier as a prize even in British waters, if it could have been shown that she. A nowingly harbored the per sens and property of enemies of the UnUed States, in the shape if the delegates and their despatches Here we have the case of the Trent fairly and distinctly settled in our favor. There can be 110 question as to the existence of all the conditions required above as being necessary to constitute the right of seizure. The captain of the Trent could not plead ignorance of the quality and mission of Messrs. Mason and Sli dell when he took them on board. They were the objects of repeated public ovations at Ha. vana, and were presented to tlie Captain Gene ral by the British Consul himself. But, even were this not so. ii will be found, when the case com^s to be further discussed, that igno rance of their character would constitute no ground of exemption from seizure. That principle has bcon laid down by some of the ablest writers on international law. and is in confor ! mity with the precedents established by Eng. land herself. The question, if any. will turn on the pacific and unbelligerent objects of the parties seized. If simple passengers, placing them-elves under the protection of the British flag, we should undoubtedly be exceeding our rights in arresting thein. The address of Jef ferson Davis to the rebel Congress, however, settles that issue, ne has removed the only rcaliy doubtful point in the controversy by proclaiming the official character of his emis baric*. Thus all the anxiety and suspense occasioned amongst timid people by Captain Wilkes' bold act ni:iy be consid"red as terminated in advance of a knowledge of its effect at the other side. The London Times and History journals gene rally h 've. we presume, orireceipt of the news, made a great show of indignation over it; but their ravings will have no sort of influence on the conduct, of the British government. We have now an opinion from the law officers of the crown in support of the view taken by that officer of his duty, und we need trouble our selves but little about the law of the newspa" pers. If, aw Mr. Layard, the t inier Secretary of State, assures us, the sympathies of the great body of the English people are with us, the bo'.d and manly course taken by our officer on his own responsibility will increase their re spect for our pluck, aud their indisposition to meddle with us. An Abolition Bible? What Are W? Com ing tol Several of our pious contemporaries of the Satanic abolition school are particularly unc tuous over a very remarkable "prophecy" which they aver lias lately been exhumed from the pivres of the Old Testament by an eminent di. vine in Boston. This wonderful prophecy is said to bo in tho fourth chapter of II iggai, and from it we cut the following choice mvrccau: ? And lo, behold, bocauss of the Kin of tho South, hor mighty mull shall be us bub04, hor i ahull b ? de nt rove I utterly, * * * yea, ultarly destroyed Khali bp her tint m, and hor rice Held* shall be wanted, a id her s .tVi-s hcI free. It would be a curious fact to find out if some one could tell us whether this was invented by the editors of the Independent, or if it were the work of the Rev. Horace Greeley, extemporized as a little pious exercise in tho intervals be' tween tho arranging of his gambling affairs. Probably the latter. A few years sinco Mr. Anson Burlingame ? who is just now airing his abolitionism off in the Flowery Land among the Celestials ? made a blasphemous speech in Con. gross that perhaps may afford a key to the new prophecy. In this speech he declared that the Boston abolitionists whom he re presented ? and who probably are as Simon Pure a stripe as the Beechers, tli? Gtoeleys and the Cheevers of these parts ? would never be content "till they had an anti-slavery constitu tion, an anti-slavery Bible, and uu anti-slavery God!" Now it seems very likely that this re markable prophecy about South Carolina nig" gers and lice fields is part of a chapter from the first instalment of tho long promised "anti slavery Bible." This and other circumstances ? some of which we shall refer to present ly ? would seem to indicate that the said ' Bible-' is in an advanced stage of pro gress, and forms part of a combined Ijiglisli and American abolition scheme to crento a revolution among us, destroy the government nnd tho country, and at the same time pollute tho morals of the people by corrupting the fountain of Holy Writ. A striking evidence of the depravity that follows such courses, and the retributive justice seen in the authors themselves, being the first to fall under their own malign influence, is exhibited jusfr now in the melancholy position of two of the leaders of tho school. Ono of them, who is a staled preacher of tho Gospel, has com menced an active agency in the circulation of immoral publications, by advertising them wide ly in the columns of his own religious journal. The other, who formerly preached so long as he could fmd audiences to listen to him, has latterly gone into the lottery business, and is also running about the city and offering to make gambling bets with everybody he meets. Ho even approached us with his immoral schemes, when he well knew, or might have known, that we had conscientious scruples against every species of gambling. But to the new text of the new Bible. There nre two or three little circumstances that make it improbable that the above quotation can be in the fourth or auy other chapter of the Prophet Huggai. In the first place, the book contains only two chapters, and, secondly, the word "rice" does not occur in the Bible at all. Rice is supposed to have had its origin in Eastern lands, either on the banks of tho Nile, in Ethiopia, near the Euphrates, or in India, and possibly it may have beon an article of food in the days of the ancient Hebrew law givers; but neither Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, nor any of the minor prophets has ever mentioned this Oriental esculent. Tho inspired writers, we know, recorded simply the naked truth. They were utterly incapable of invention or misrepresen tation. But w itli the abolitionists all things are possible, and we are glad to be able to throw some light on the path of these new pro phets. A noted abolition lender in England ? one John Cassell by name ? an ambiiious grocer, who has made some money in vending te.i, molasses, soap and putty, 1ms lately com menced the publication of the Bible in num bers, one of which is before us. We find in the ninth chapter of Exodus, and the thirty-second verse, the word ? rice'." By looking at any correct copy of the Bible it will be been that the word "rice" does not occur in the chap ter at all. As It will be several years before this work is all finished, at the rate it is now appearing, in numbers, there will be abundance of time to make any furthor interpolations in matters relating to Southern slavory, rice plan tations, cotton culture, Jkc., Ac.; and who knows how far they mean to go? Do they in tend to give us Fremont's proclamation, an ac count of tho rout of the rebels art Tort Royal, or (lie race of the ''Little Villain" from Bull run, with the disaster to the wagon which he is so reluctant to pay for? Some may be disposed to look on this new version of the Bible as a mere literary curiosi ty; b\it we sec it in a far graver light. Some two hundred and sixty years ago Theodore Beza and others issued an English translation of the Bible that is known to Biblical students and book collectors as the "Breeches Bible." In the third chapter of Genesis the first pair are represented as sewing fig leaves together and making themselves "broeches." There is still another edition of the Bible where tho word '?vinegar" appears instead of "vineyard." This is known as the "Vinegar Bible." Now, by the aid of the abolitionists and an ambitious grocer, whose legitimate business is to deal in rice, cof fee and sugar, we have a "Rice Biblo." Seo Ex odus, chapter nine, verBe thirty-two. What shall wo see next? When will there dawn upon a benighted world a complete edi tion of tho long expected "Anti-Slavery Bible?" As yet we have only some se lect portions. When completed we shall probably have all the chapters of the Pro phet Haggai, and perhaps a new book from the Prophet Horace, in which he will give us his ideas of lotteries, gambling, &c., &c. Be sides these additions we shall, no doubt, be treated to some refreshing alterations and inter polations, with accounts of rice plantations, South C'aroliua niggers and Yankee lleets. It is useless to anticipate; but probably we may see something like the the following: ? "Is Sum ner also among the prophets?" "And Lincoln said unto Davis, ? Thou art the man." " A British Postat. Gkikvanck. ? It is a cause of great complaint among our merchants and others that letters I to and from Great Britain, not fully prepaid, are charged with the full rate on delivery, jnst as if there had be en no pre payment whatever. Considering that, where ! stamps have been put on qt nil. the underpay ment has, in all probability, been accidental, ; this system is clearly inequitable. We saw a | letter a few days ago with seventeen British J shilling stamps, on it. upon which the receiver had to pay the full postage, because the pack age [ \ wan a quarter of an ounce over tho weight which the stamps wo"uld have paid for. This, however, is according to the treaty between the United States and England; but we submit it to the consideration of the Postmaster Gene ral to propose that tho treaty should be amended in this particular. It operates badly on both sides of the Atlantic, and England would surely agree to el ? underpaid letters from tho United State* n " extra postage only, iu consideration our doing the same towards letters fi reat Britain. Tlie Case of the 2Yu*bvlllc in England. By the arrival of the Africa we have some interesting details about the burning of the Harvey Birch by the Confederate steamer Nash ville, details which correct errors in previous intelligence. It appears that, so far from tho vessel destroyed being in British waters at the time of her capture, she was iu north latitude 49 6, and west longitude 9 52, in seventy-flvc fathoms water, and some four degrees at sea, southwest of the Land's End. No point, therefore, can be raised about her being in neutral waters. Equally untrue is it that the captain of the Nashville had no commission, as Captain Nel son is alleged to have stated. On the contrary* Captain l'egram holds not merely a privateer's commission, but a commission as Lieutenant iu tho Confederate Navy, like the captain of the Sumter. Had he no commission, he and his erew would bo hanged as pirates. What Captain Nelson probably meant was that the captain of the Nashville held no commission from any recognized or legitimate government. As England, however, has recog nized, not indeed the independence of the South ern confederacy, but its rights of belligerency, and has proclaimed complete neutrality be tween "the American bolligerents," as the Lon don Times designates the United States govern ment and the rebels, thus putting them on an equal footing, it follows, as a consequence, that the British government, to be consistent, must permit the Nashville to relit at her ports, as she did in the case of the James Adger, or would in the case of any United States sliip-of-war. But refitting merely for sea, and converting the Nashville into a ship-of-war in a British port, are totally different things, and it remains to be seen whether the latter will bo allowed, which is a l'ar greater indulgence than the James Adger claimed, and is also prohibited iu the Queen's proclamation. " Strict impartiality," which is the true position of a neutral, would seem to forbid the reconstruction of the Nashville for warlike purposes. It is true England might make the matter appear equal by offering our government the same permission; but it would be only appearance; for the United Slates do not require to have their sliips-of-war built or reconstructed in British ports. They have their own ports and mechanics to rely upon. Already the Bermuda and the Flngal have been allowed to carry arms and ammunition to tho rebels from England, under the pretence of trading to the West Indies, and it is believed that both these vessels belong to the Confede rate government. The Fingal is represented as iron elad, and is now at Charleston. By this mail from England we learn that the Adriatic steamship is being prepared for the same des tiny in an English port. The British govern ment may connive at these vessels, pretending to be ignorant of their character; but the case of tho Nashville is entirely different. She is open ly and above board a rebel steamer, and auda ciously claims as a light to be converted into a vessel-of-war in a British port for tho purpose of preying upon American commerce on the high seas. The government, it appears, hesi tates as to its course, and has not yet decided what it will do. Meantime the police arc keep ing watch on the Nashville. Telegraphic mes sages have been going back and forward. Groups of politicians discuss the kuotty points, and great excitement prevails. Wo shall soon see what is the real complexion of British neu trality. The London Observer hints that in case of any violation of the laws of strict neutrality by the Nashville while in British porls, the courts, on the representation of the American Minister, might be moved to action, as in the ca?e of the seizure of two Sicilian ships by the government of Naples in 1858, and more re cently in the case of the issue <jf Kossuth notes. What might be done, however, is one thing, and what will be done is another. But there is another point to be settled, and that is whether Capt. Pegram, by the laws of war, had a right to take prisoners in irons into a neutral port. It is said he surrendered them to the American Consul; but they were in custody in British waters; and it appears that even in England "the arrival of the vessel at South ampton under the circumstances, and her land j ing prisoners of war, are looked upon by many persons as an infraction of the Queen's procla mation of neutrality." The next arrival from England will be looked forward to with great interest by the American people. The news will furnish us with a decided test of what we may expect hereafter at the hauds of the British government. An Exchange: of Prisoners with tub Rebels. ? We learn, from the communication8 which are passing between the government and the families of our officers and soldiers now in prison at the South, as well as by our despatch es from Washington and Boston, that the gov ernment is taking into serious consideration a general exchange of prisoners with the rebels, or rather a mutual release on parole of the prison ers which we hold ? an equal number to be re leased by the rebels. If this measure is carried out we shall probably soon have all our soldiers who are now in confinement back again in their homes. This intention on the pari of the government is being adopted as a matter of humanity; but it is rendered the more desirable from the hor rible treatment which our officers and men are receiving in Southern prison houses. It would hardly be believed that in any civilized com munity prisoners of war could be treated as our soldiers are by ilie rebels; and one wonders how any of our race could submit their fellow citi zens, as well as their fellow beings, to the bru tal discipline of the Southern jails. Many of the prisoners are half starved, naked and de prived of the ordinary decencies of life. They are compelled to dwell in filth and disease. Some of our officers, high in rank, who have been accustomed to every comfort, have been denied the privilege of changing their linen for throe weeks together, and they are limited to the miserable diet of bread and water, with the relish of a pint of thin soup a day. In the face of these facts it is time that gov ernment should make an etfort to relieve our prisoners from their barbarous jailors. When the rebellion is over the rebel* afterwards civp tured and held to account can receive <heir deserts. Caucus of tuk Abolit;on Mkmuebs of obxbb. ? The caucus of the republican memb of Congress, call.'-'d by a two days' notice Saturday evening hat, in the hall of the Ho of Representatives, proved a complete fail Only twelve of the radicals assembled, untl caucus was adjourned to this evening, 'v hope it will prove an equal abortion agu?'n. The object of the caucus vas to discuss 1 1 emancipation measure now pending in Coir gress, and it was hoped that resolutions woa? be adopted censuring the President for his c< tervative policy. The fact that the m<eti| was only attended by a dozen men is the H' best endorsement tho patriotic course of if President could receive. The abolitioni *ts tup a.i well make up their miuds at once that tin Satanic policy cannot be carried either by for or fraud. The people are against them. A ca cus of the republican members of Congress a very unu. sual proceeding; but never wa3 party caucus so little callcd for as now, win all parties arc rallying to the support of tl government in carrying on the war of tl Union. Tho conservative republicans feel tli; it would be an insult to tha democratic repr sentatives to lend themselves to this part: movement at a crisis in this nation's histo when unanimity is essential to the public safety and mere party measures cannot be sustained If the radicals should even succeed in carryin their obnoxious bills by a majority, it is certai the President would give them a quietus by lr veto; and there can be little doubt that whe| the abolitionists come before the people for rt election they will be sure to receive a quietu?;. which will put them to sleep for the remainde of their lives. We have obtained reliable ii telligence even from New Enp land, where w have commissioners ascertaining the publi sentiment, that the emancipation measures wil not be sustained by the people; and if the ad ministration should adopt them it would b shattered to pieces like a potter's vessel. An<< what, wo usk, would become of the authors o such revolutionary measures? What these fanatical politicians are seekin( to do would have the effect of driving the na tion back to barbarism. No modern civilizet nation carries on war in the fashion which the] propose. When the British government, ii 185C, solicited the United States to become 4 purty to the treaty of Paris, as regards pri vateering, the reply of our government wa' that if tho humane and enlightened rule wot applied to the sea which in all civilized coun tries is now applied to the land, that tho pri vate property of an enemy is exempt from cap- < ture, the United States would agree to the ~ change. This shows what the position of our ^ government and of all the governments Europe was then upon the question of cap' taring an enemy's private property on land, Do the revolutionary radicals desire to commit the nation to barbarities which would deprive us of the sympathy and countenance of tha civilized world? But the constitution of the United States absolutely prohibits the proposed';, confiscation in the case of domestic insurrec- t' tion. If the abolitionists in Congress will pass r au act which abolishes tho constitution and,, dissolves the bonds of the Union, then, we ask, for what is it that the nation is now shedding its blood aud treasure? The Irish Famine and Emigration to Amzm- j CA. ? The failure of the potato crop, which threatens Ireland with another famine not less disastrous than that of 1847-8, will result in another great exodus of its popula tion. The popular mind will be turned to emigration as the only panacea with in individual reach in the midst of the terrible distress that is likely so soon to over take that country. The majority of the Irish peasantry, it is true, will be utterly unable to raise sufficient money to carry them to Ame rica; but hundreds of thousands will, with the scanty means at their disposal, and the assist ance of friends already here, succeed in making their way to the land of the free and the home of the brave. For some months past there has been a large decrease in the number of immi grants arriving at this and other Northern ports; but we may now look forward to a sensible and continued increase in the tide of immigration. The idea lias gone abroad that this is a bad time to come to the United States, for the reasou that employment is said to be hardly obtainable. But this requires correc tion. There never was a period when an ac tive body and a strong arm were so sure of em ployment as at present. All the avenues of industry are open to both the skilled and un skilled laborer, and agriculture is universally flourishing, while most of our manufactures are in brisk demand. Moreover, there is the army open to all, in which a private's daily pay ia equal to many a laborer's week's wage3 in Ireland, besides good rations, camp and cloth ing. We can readily absorb the surplus popu lation of Ireland or any other country. Our resources are so vast that all who come will find ample field for honest industry; and in a hundred years time, and with a hundred mil lions more people, it will be said, as now, the more the better. The Cotton Question and the Blockade. ? One of (he first measures of the rebel govern ment was to prohibit the export of cotton, and to declare that not a pound of it should go to supply the wants of Europe. This was a stroke to compel England to force our blockade and thus get her into a war with this country. Fail ing to accomplish this, even by the suave whis perings of the rebel Commissioners, we find that orders are issued now to burn all the cotton on the approach of the Union troops. Apart from the usselessnees of this proceeding, it will only have the effect of showing what the object of the rebel States is, and it will convince the gov ernments of Europe that they are determined that they shall have no cotton, unless they con sent to be driven into our domestic quarrel. Such a spirit will hardly help the chances of recognition by foreign governments. The Navai. Cordon Anorxn Rerki.tjon. ? By the following list of footholds seized by our troops on the coast of the rebellious States, it will be seen how extensive a ct.rdon is drawn around them on the seaboard:?
