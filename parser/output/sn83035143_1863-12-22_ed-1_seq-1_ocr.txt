Commonfort has been ' murdered, and the Archbishop of Mexico nan ihum a bull or excommunication against all French and Mexioans whoop posed him. Louis Napoleon has evidently apturtd the elephant. What will he do with it T That's the question. The most recent news from Texas is to ths effeot that our foroes are still operating along the coast, and will probably confine their operations to navigable waters. Our Member, Hon. R. P. Spaulding. we see by the telegraph dispatches, has offered a resolution in the House, which was passed by a vote of eighty-six to sixty-nine, for the appointment of a Belect Committee of nine, to consider and report on the sub. jeet of a National Bankrupt Act. This bill is a much needed one, and we are glad that our worthy Representative has taken the initiatory steps to have a bill reported and noted upon. We publish this morning some extracts from Riehmcnd papers, showing the spirit in whioh they receive the recent Amnesty Proclamation. The Examiner and Whig are in a very alarmed state of mind in regard to the possible eonsoription of all able bodied men. The reports reoelved by telegraph of the loss of the Ironsides by being entangled in the obstructions in the Charleston harbor, and the disabling of two Monitors, should be taken with great allowance, con sidering that the news came through reb 1 sources. It is doubtless untrue. . Bureau of Emancipation. The bill introduced by Representative Eliot, of Massachusetts, and referred to the Belect Committee of which he is Chair Ban, creates t Bureau of Emancipation in the War Department, with a Commissioner en a salary of $1,000 at the head. To this Bureau all questions touching freedmen are to be referred, and all re- tarns of proceedings to be made by mili tary and civil officers charged with the execution of laws or orders relating to freedmen. Ths Commissioner is also charged with the execution of laws pro viding for colonization, the delivery of bonds for compensation for freedmen, and the establishment of regulations for their treatment and disposition. b The New York Herald and General Grant. The New York Herald brings out Qeuer- .1 (ir-unt a the r!nnnrha1 .ani Uia fn- President next year. After summing up his military exploits, rnd comparing them with those rchieved by Jackson, Harrison and Taylor, it comes to the comfortable onolusion that General Grant would make a capital candidate for the Copper - heads. Speaking of the General's poli ticks, it says: "All that we know is, that his antece dents are democratic, and that his views and inclinations are sufficiently conserva tive that is, Copperhead, for the pur poses of an independent conservative Copperhead movement for thj Presi dency." The Herald always uses the term "con sertive" in the sense of pro-slavery. A " conservative is one whose great aim and ' objeet is to continue or preserve slavery. The word is never applied in any other sense by the old Satanic. It thinks that "General Grant is sufGcientlp pro slavery to suit the purposes of an independent Copperhead movement for the Presi dency." General Grant may ask in maiement what he has done or said that commends him to the favor of the inde pendent Copperheads, or their organ, the Id pro slavery Herald ? His anti-slavery letter to Hon. E. B. Washburne, most oer tainly gave the Satanic no warraut for committing such a libel on him, as to pro nounce him " sufficient pro slaver to suit the purposes of the Copperheads." But we ask, What has become of its other candidate the " grave-digger of the f the Chickahominy ?" It brought him oat nearly two years ago, and has been furiously running him ever since for the Presidency. The "Independent Conserv atives,' nominated him the other day at Cincinnati, at the instance and request of that sheet.

XVII, CLEVELAND, TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 22. NO. 311. SPECIAL DISPATCHES SPECIAL DISPATCHES TO THE CLEVELAND LEADER. GENERAL ROSECRANS APPOINTED TO COMMAND THE THE DEPARTMENT OF MISSOURI. GEN. SCHOFIELD REMOVED Important Ammendment to the Conscription Law. The Whole Able Bodied Adult Male Population Liable to the Draft. Disorganization of the Democratic Members. Members. Failure of the Movement Against Post Master General Blair. [Special to the Cleveland LEADER.] WASHINGTON, December 21. MILITARY CHANGES. of Governor Dennieon and Secretary Chase, alluded to some days ago, as well as with ths wishes of leading radioal Missourians, General Rosecrans was to day assigned to oommand the Department of Missouri, and General Bohofield re- lieved. Kansas is erected to a separate Depart ment, and General Curtis is assigned to its command, and it is understood that Gener al Bohofield goes to Baltimore, though this does not yet seem to be wholly established, The President has been for some time convinoed of General Curtis' innooeuca of the alleged cotton speculations and has thus taken the first opportunity to g've him a new command. General Rosecrans sppointment is proof that the President did not share in tbe slanderous attacks on that officer, and that the Secretary of War's enmity and the malignant persecution at tempted by one or two of his subordin ates, had to give way, and if General Schofield is really appointed to Baltimore it will be the finishing touch that proves Mr. linooln the author of the whole ar THE 

EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. General Butler has been formally as signed to the duty of exchanging prison ers, vioe Meredith, relieved. This does not interfere with the oommand of his De partment Exchanges, it is now said will resumed in a few days. The first negro was exchanged a day or two ago. CONSCRIPTION BILL AMENDMENTS. It is pretty certain that the distinction of classes in the conscription bill will be abolished before Congress takes a recess for the holidays, so that the draft, which comes early in January, may fall not only upon men under thirty-five, but upon tbe whole able bodied adult male population of the country. General Schenck to day offered such a bill in the House. It was unanimously approved by the Military Committee, and the Senate Committee is also understood to favor it. The House will resist any attempt to pass further amendments to the Conscription Law till after the recess, on the ground that the bill is imoerfeot now and any hasty at tempts to patch it ate only likely to make matters worse. Clergymen arc pretty certain to be exempted when the amend ments are made, if the $390 clause is re pealed, otherwise not. Statistics have been laid before the Com mittees showing that one-sixth of those ex to empted under the last draft got off for be ing the only son of a widow. Men worth great fortunes, whoss widowed mothers happened to be living with them, were exempted under it. Tais will be carefully guarded in contemplated amendments. A strong movement is likely to be made this session to consolidate the regulars and volunteers. Representations to the Military Commit tees in both Houses from all parts of the country seem about equally divided on the subject of regaining or repealing the $300 clause. The statements that have crept into pa- psrs that Senator Sumner fully endorses and adopts all the views in the President's Message are unwarranted. He has of course, expressed no dissatisfaction, but he could hardly be expected to give ap so promptly views of his own either in con flict with President's or supposed to be so. MoClurg's Bill for payment of the Mis souri Home Guards oame np to day from the Ways and Means Committee, and Blow suoeeeded against the opposition of Party Democrats, in getting it made a special order for to-morrow. " The Democrat, continue to display a state of disorganisation sj remarkable, that the New York World to-night made them a sharp editorial lecture about it. The vote on Clay Smith's handsomely conceived resolutions the other day, split them fairly in two, and to-day an effort was made to prevent the payment of any cf the twenty millions appropriated for premiums to negroes. ' Prominent Demo crats voted against the attempt, and for treating negroes like other soldiers. THE 

MOVEMENT AGAINST MR. BLAIR. The movement attempted to be inaugu rated through the proposed action of the House Administration Caucus, against Mr. Blair, seems likely to fail. The Chairman of ths Caucus seems unwilling to call it together, and the members seem to have a prudent recollection of a similar demon stration once made against another Cabi net offioer in another wing of the Capitol. Some of the members still insist on a meet ing of the Canons, but it will probably be smothered. A NEW LINE OF STEAMERS. ' Informal negotiations for the establish ment of a line of steamers between Boston and Rio de Janeiro, have been oommenoed. eUt.' J. C T Ietcher; formerly of Indiana, i . v.. . . w , , i. . , . ( : i and just returned from Brazil, has been arranging it on our part. The Legislature of Old Virginia assem bled at Alexandria and passed an Aot, to day, providing for the election of dele. gites to a Convention, to meet in that city on the 13th of July next, for the purpose of altering the Constitution. The object of the amendment is to rid ths Constitu tion of a elacse prohibiting the Legislature from abolishing slavery. If this clause Is stricken out the Legislature can free counties exempted by the President's Pro clamation from that institution. Voters for delegates will bs required, when chal lenged, to swear fealty to the United States and to the State of Virginia as re. stored at Wheeling, In 1861, and that they have not given aid or comfort to the rebel- Hon.

Secretary Chase has gone to New York. It is stated that he means to negotiate another $50,000,000 loan. 

ILLINOIS TROOPS GOING HOME. Mr. Fessenden, of Illinois, has procured leave for all Illinois troops in hospitals here to return home for their reoovery. He has also procured permission for ths 8th Illinois cavalry to return home to reamit so soon as three-fourths of the regiment has agreed to be re-mnstered in. PRESIDENTIAL ITEMS. The President, to-day, sent letters to Congress from the Cincinnati, Boston and New York Freedmen' Society. The President has signed the bill grant a medal to General Grant. THE BOUNTY QUESTION. An interesting debate sprang up in the House to-day on the bill to apply $20,000, 000 for bounties, 4.C, to soldiers now vol unteering. Democrats at first opposed it, Mr. Brooks leading off. Sohenok. Kelly and Lovejoy made capital little speeches for our side. Kelly was particularly happy and called out hearty applause from the galleries. Cox tried to interrupt him with authorities against oonscription and was silenced by a keen retort that bronght down the galleries. It was ths liveliest little passage we have yet had this session. The bill finally passed, many of the Demo crats voting for iL The Democrats are manifestly trying to get over on the war platform. Captain Bontelle, of the United States Coast Survey, writes from Charleston that toe obstructions in the harbor there con sist of a double line of piles across the channel from Pinckney to the middle ground. From thenoe to Fort Johnson there is an opening of two hundred feet. Piles are driven'in seven fathoms of wa ter, and ean easily be demolished by rams. Du tk Captain says nothinc will h none nntil Dahlgren is removed. The Committee of Ways and Means ealled Commodore Smith, of the Construc tion Bureau of the Navy Department, be fore them to-day, to ascertain if the es timates of that Department could not be reduced by giving out vessels on contract private builders. The indications are that the estimates contained in the Naval Report will be materially cut down. A delegation of ship owners and others from New York is here for the purpose of urging the President to remove the pre sent Secretary of Navy. A stormy pressure is being made by officers in the fisld, to have General Mo Clellan and other shelved Generals mus tered out of service in order to open the way to promotion.

TheGovernors of many of the States in letters to leading Senators protested against its repeal, as it must run up tha price of substitutes to at least $1,000. The probabilities to-day are that the ex emption will be increased by the Senate committee to 5oUU. Government will dispatch a messenger Halifax to-morrow w th instructions to our Consul there.

Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, from the Military Committee, reported a bill repealing the 31 and 10th sections of the enrollment act so that the two classes of persons to be drafted shall be consolidated into one, this 10 inae eneot on ana after its nassacre. Objection being made to the consideration of Mr. Sohenck's report at this time, he temporarily withdrew iL Mr. leoman of Kentucky, offered a ser ies of resolutions, setting torth that a con spiracy of persons exists assuming to be a Government of the Confederate States, for tne purpose of withdrawing States from ths Federal Union, but that Ibis does not extinguish the political franchise of such States, and that tbe oititens thereof ean at any time resume their Civil Govern ment, on the only condition that their constitution is Republican, and that it is sufficient for those who are loyal and qualified by the election laws to resume their Slate Government, and this is suffi cient evidenoe of loyalty fca. ine nouse refused to second the demand for the previous question, when on motion of Lovejoy, the resolutions were referred to a teleot committee on the Rebelious Mr. Spalding, of Ohio, offered a resolu tion for the appointment of a select coin mitt of nine to consider and report oa the sut ject of a National Bankrupt Act. Mr. Ilolman moved to lay the resolu tion on the table, lost, 69 to 80. The resol ution was then adopted. Mr. Ashley of Ohio, introduced a bill, which was referred, providing a provision al Government in the military districts of the insurgent States, and authorizing the loyal eitizens thereof to organize a Govern ment, Republican in form, and for other purposes. Mr. Dcnenck, introduced a Dill to create burea of military justice. Raferred to the Committee on Military Affairs. Mr. Aehley offered a resolution grant ing the use of this Hall for a public meet ing of the Fieedman's Relief Association. Mr. Cox objected, and this, by the rules of the House, prevented further action on the resolution to day. Mr. Schenck moved the suspension of the rules in order to take up tbe report and act upon the bill to consolidate the two classes in the enrollment act, into one. The vote was, yeas, bO, nays, 63, so the rales were not suspenddd, a two-third vote being necessary. Mr. Miner or Pennsylvania, ottered a resolution respectfully requesting the President to promptly instruct those hav ing the charge of the exchange of pris oner to propose to the so-called Southern Confederacy to exchange white man for white man, leaving all other questions, including that relating to negro prisoners, to be disposed of hereafter, so that the suffering white men may be restored to the service of their Government, their friends and their fi resiles.

Mr. Wilson, gave notice of a bill to make it illegal for any number of Congress to act as counsel in any ease in which the United Stated is interested. Mr, Morgan subjected a joint resolution, calling upon the Secretary of the War, for the names of all officers and men of the re gular army, who have deserted or resigned between ths 1st of December, I860, and December, 1863. Adopted. Mr. Foots, offered a similar resolution relative to the Navy. The pending question being on the post ponement of Mr Sumner's Resolution, em bodying the proposed role of the Senate, Mr. Bayard continued the disoussion and favored a postponement of aotion. Mr. Sumner said it was difficult to resist the application nrged with so much perti nacity by the gentleman from Delaware; yet that gentleman enjoyed the most ample opportunity of considering it, and it was due the Senator that it should be settled without delay and before the Holidays. He should deem it his duty to pass it to a votc The morning hour having expired, Mr. Wilson moved to take np th bill for in creased bounty and pay of volunteers, which was done. The Committee's amendment, allowing toldieri to re enlist in other branch of the service, coming first under considera tion, was agreed to. Mr Wilson explained thatin Ootoberlast when it was found that ths draft for three hundred thousand men was insufficient to meet the wants of the War Department, a Dounty or to veterans and $300 to others was offered, and this bill was de. signed to carry out the pledge thus made. Nine million dollars had then been re ceived from commutation, and this was now augmented to twelve millions. Mr. Wilson acknowledged the necessity of exercising great care with regard to the depletion of the Treasury Department and to keeping the credit of the Government intact. It had always been thought nore uimoutt to omain more money than men. He wanted the currency of the country to dc sound, and her credit good, ret we must keep our pledges made to enlisted men. Their enlistments were numerous, not only in the Nothern State, but in the Southwest, Bast Tennessee had recruited 3,503 men, Texas had furnished two regi ment, and Arkansas had yielded substan tial additions to their forces, such recruit should be dealt with according to promisee. He was in favor of a commutation clause for the payment of the bounties proposed. Harris, did not favor the amendment of the Committee, as it stood, and thought it would stop all recruiting after the 6th of January. Mr. Lane of Indinia, said we could not nil our armies with conscripts alone. There was 8,000,000 men subject to the draft at this time, and of this number, on the basis of the last draft, but 426,000 could be brought into the fi;ld, if the entire enrollment were taken, and out of this number from 20,000 to 30,000 would be deserters. Indiana had more than filled her quota, and could be depended on under any circumstances to furnish her full share without resort to the draft. Mr. Collamer moved to strike ont the words January uih, and insert till Febru ary 1st. Los'. Mr. Howard moved t striks out the word $15 in th Committee' amendment and insert $20 aa the bounty for obtaining enlistments or veterans. Rejected. After a conversational debate, partioi. pated in by Messrs. Wilson, Hawes, and Fessenden, on motion of Mr. Sherman tbe Senate adjourned. BATTLE AT FORT GIBSON. ST. LOUIS, December 21.

They went within fifteen miles Red River and found the enemy had ohanged position since last advloes and they were nnable to proceed further. Their return was a constant skirmish for over 100 miles, strong bodies of the en emy being poeted at all the cross roads to intercept them. They cut their way through in some places and evaded other posts by taking blind mountain passes. Their loss is trifling. Among the prisoners captured is the notorious Handy Lane, who boasts of hav ing killed over 100 Union citizen with his own hands.

Th talk the Navy Yard is that she will go down Charleston to take the place of the lost Weehawken. The Atlanta is more like the Ironside than any of th mon itora.

I do not know that anything is expected from Texas just now. Possibly there maybe. It is reported here that Magruder is at Columbus, on the Colorado, with a large force, and that if he enters the interior hts progress will be disputed. He will not, in my opinion, leave navigable water very soon. MoGruder was fully apprised the intended attack on the Rio Grande, and rather invited it, with a hope of em broiling the United States with Francs. PLOT TO RESCUE THE PRISONERS AT LOOKOUT.
