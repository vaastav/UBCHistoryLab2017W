Feom papers received per steamer State of California, from San Francisco yesterday vre get the full text of President Arthur's ..message, to congress. The message, which is quite ex tensive in verbiage and import, opens with brief and fitting refer ence to the death of Garfield, and after discussing our relations with various foreign countries, it says, speaking of the Panama canal: "The questionsgrowingoutof the proposed Inter-Oceanic water way across the Isthmus of Panama are of grave national importance. This government has not been un dutiful of the solemn obligation imposed upon it by its compact of 1846 with Colombia .as the inde pendent and sovereign mistress of the territory crossed by the canal, and has sought to render them ef fective by fresh engagements with the Colombian republic, looking to the practical execution of the negotiations to this end. After they had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solu tion here, they were met in Colom bia by the disavowal of the Powers which its envoy had assumed and by a proposal for renewed nego tiations on a fortified basis. Mean while, the government learned that Colombia had proposed to the European rowers to loin in a guarantee of the neutrality of the proposed Panama canal a guar antee which would be in direct contravention of our obligations, as the sole guarantee of the integ rity of Colombian Territory and of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamented predecessor felt it .his duty to place before the Euro pean Powers the reasons which made the ""prior guarantee of the United. States indispensable, be fore which the interjection of any foreign guarantee might bo re garded s a superfluous and uu friendly act. Foreseeing the prob able reliance of the British gov ernment of tho provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty of 1850 as affording room lor a share on the guarantee which the United States covenanted "with Colombia four years before, I have not hesitated to supplement .the action of vay predecessor by proposing to Her Majesty's government the modifi cation of that instrument and the abrogation of such clauses thereof as do not comport -with the obli gations of the United States to ward Colombia or with the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact." The President earnestly recom mends the suppression of polyga my, and deals with the usual vex atious Indian question with good judgment. He recommends Gov ernmental aid to education, states that the tariff laws need revision, discusses at length the qualifica .Uonsrfor office and favors civil service reform. In relation to the important question of the presi dential succession he says: "The importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for Presidential electors was called to the attention of the people more than four years ago. It is to be hoped that some well defined -measure may be devised before another national election which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a temporary character for the determination of any questions, upon contested re turns. Questions which concern the very existence of the Govern ment and the liberties of the peo ple, were suggested by the pro longed illness of the late Presi $ dent, and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions of his office. It is provided by the second article of the Constitution, in the fourth clause of its first section, that in case of the ro- moval of the President from office or by his death from assassination or inability to discharge the pow ers and duties of said office, the same shall devolve on tho Vice- President. "What is the intention of tho Constitution in the specifi cation of inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, is one of the contingencies which calls the Vice-President to the exercise of Presidential , func tions? Is the inability long-con tinued intellectual capacity, or is it the broad import of what must be its -extent and duration? How must its existence be established? Has the President, whose inability is the subject of inquiry, any voice in determining whether or not it exists, or is the decision of that mo mentous and delicate question confided to the Vice-President, or is it contemplated by the Consti tution that Congress should pro vide by law precisely what should constitute inability, and how and by what tribunal or authority it should bo ascertained? If the inability proves to be temporary in its nature, and during con tinuance tho Vice-President law fully exercises the functions of the Executive, by what tenure does ho hold his office? Does he continue as President the remainder of the four years' term, or would the elected President, if his inability should cease in the interval, be empowered to resume his office, and if, having such lawful au thority, he should exercise it, would tho Vice-President be there upon empowered to resume his powers and duties as such? 1 can not doubt that these important questions will receive your early and thoughtful consideration." The message is characterized, throughout, by good sense and evident intent to convey an im pression of candid earnestness, in which he has succeeded. The document is a credit to our Chief Magistrate, and a satisfactory an swer to any who may have felt disposed to carp at or hastily criti cise his official course. The memorial calling for a res toration of the land donated for tho construction of the Cascade division of the N. P. R. R. and which passed the lower house of the Legislature was killed in the council. The Yakima Record calls for the ayes and noes, and wants to know who have been traitors to the interests and demands of tho people. Col. Sso. "W. Fokxey, protege and alleged son of James Buchan an, and for twenty-five years a prominent politician and journal ist, is reported dying in Philadel phia. His political correspondence, if published, will make interesting reading for many public men. It is thought that all the inter nal revenue officials will work against the movement in Congress to reduce the tax on whiskey. Testimony of "experts" in the Guiteau "trial" tends to disprove the plea of insanity. The entire system of convict labor in California ceases after the first of next month.
