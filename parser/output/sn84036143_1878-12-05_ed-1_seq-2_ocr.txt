We see it stated that the work of grading the road bed of the Utah & Northern railway has been advanced to Eagle Rock Bridge, and that track laying is in progress at the rate of one mile a day. This not only looks like business, but is business. There is excellent authority for saying that sufficient iron will be manufactured this winter to extend the track next year a distance of 200 miles north of Snake River Crossing. That will bring the iron horse a fair distance inside of Mon tana's limits. Mr. Jay Gould and associates are apparently the only ones in good earnest engaged in hastening railroad construction to our doors. The Northern Pacific people have given us plenty of promises, but precious lit tle of performance. Jay Gould has done very little talking, but a "heap" of solid work. We desire to see this Uath & Northern road completed to the geographical pivot and business center of Montana. Our people, we believe are generally disposed to favor and encourage this undertaking, and to beckon the good work forward by such means as lay in their power. A liberal period of exemption from taxation as an induce ment for early railroad connection with the transcontinental lines will, w r e think, be voted by the Legislature. Should Jay Gould and associates require something more, the Herald on its own responsibility will under take to add a guarantee of 30,000 tons of freight and 10,000 passengers the first year the narrow-gauge strikes Helena. We be lieve this estimate of patronage is small— much less, in fact, than what the first full year's business will give the railroad. Jay Gould has now to do wdth railroads that pay dividends. He has in the Utah & North ern a road which, when completed to the heart of Montana, will pay him better in proportion than the Union Pacific. The tide of emigration setting toward Mon tana; the grand mineral developments we are making ; the enormous mercantile and other tonnage—estimated the present year at 44, 000,000 pounds—which must be brought to us, and the thousands of tons to be carried away—these matters we presume, have re ceived full investigation and consideration. The railroad authorities are making no mis take in hurrying forward the narrow-gauge to Montana. It should penetrate our south ern border in 1879. AKBV9T EURO. A dispatch announces the death 3 esterday t Butte of Dr. Auson Ford, at the age of 72 ears' Mr. Ford was one of our old pio eers, having come to the Territory in 1863 nd settled at Nevada, in Alder Gulch, where e engaged in the mercantile business. In 865 or 1866 he removed to Butte, where, we elieve, he has since continuously resided, nd where for many years he has been a jus ice of the peace and postmaster, holding the itter office at the time of his death. He was man of cheerful disposition and of intelli ;ence, and the newspapers of the Territory iaye frequently been indebted to him for cor espondence of value. He won hosts of riends, took a lively interest in public af airs, during much of his life was an antive )emocratic partisan, but in recent years his »arty ties were considerably relaxed. We lelieve he was a native of the State of New fork. Montgomery Blair writes a column letter > the New York Sun , showing that Tilden the only available Presidential candidate )r the Democracy, and attributes the recent )ute of the party in the North to the attempt > withdraw Tilden. The railroad kings are all gathering in Washington to lay plans and marshal their forces for the approaching campaign in Con gress. Among the magnates is Wright, Presi dent of the Northern Pacific, Brown of the Texas Pacific, and Huntington, of the Central Pacific. The White Pine News, established at Hamilton, Nevada in 1870, has stopped pub lication. The reason of its suspension was caused by the going down of Hamilton, and the inability of its publisher to print the pa per any longer without sustaining a loss. The report of the Surgeon General shows that the number of deaths from yellow fever at New Orleans and Memphis already reaches 7.000. The deaths in other localities will doubtless swell the grand total to 10,000 or 12 . 000 . —According to the Enterprise the Nevada Republicans will have a majority of 44 on joint ballot in the next Legislature—11 in the Senate and 33 in the Assembly. The Rev. Mr. G. D. McKay, one of the missionaries of the Presbyterian church sta tioned in Formosa, China, has just married a Chinese girl, Miss Chang Mia Tsong. Some administration Republicans in New York are said to be hostile to Conkling, but this alarms no one. The Senator will be re nominated and re-elected by a large majority The President's annual message is unnsu ally long, but not long enough to reach Mon tana over a broken wire. THE
