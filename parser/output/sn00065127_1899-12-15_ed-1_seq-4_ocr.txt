The Farmers Leader By A. E. LINN. -Xember South Dakota PreaB Association.- That portion of President McKinley's message relating to the money ques tion is a repetition of previous recom mendations on that subject, and a re flection—so far as it dare be—of the views of the Indianapolis monetary convention. In brief the president's recommendations on this line are fairly answered by the currency bill pre pared by the republican committee for presentation to the house. The estab lishment of the single gold standard, the surrender to the banks of the. con trol over the volume of the currency, the practial retirment of the greenbacks the authority in the secretary of the treasury to issue gold bonds at hi8 pleasure—These represent the purposes and the policies of the administration with respect to the finances of the nation. The president approaches the question of trusts very gingerly, and when he has taken up that important question he drops it without having anid anything. Having wasted a great many words in the successful effort to. avoid the trust question the president concludes with this "recommenda tion:" It is to be hoped that such uni formity, founded in a wise and just discrimination between what is in jurious and what is useful and necessary in business operations, may be obtained, and that means may be found for the congress within the limitations of its consti tutional power so to supplant an af fective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States ade quate to compel a general obser vance of the salutary rules to which I have referred. "As clear as mud" is the best de scription of this meaningless bit of rhetoric. The president touches lightly on the subject of the Transvaal war. Be refers to "impartiality of this gov ernment toward both the combatants." He neglects to explain, however, the inconsistency of this statement when coupled with the reports of the speeches recently deliyered by our minister to England, Mr. Choate, from which it is apparent that there is not, after all, so large a measure of impartiality. On the subject of Cuba the president de clares that the pledge for independence must be faithfully kept. Then he pro ceeds to present reasons why the ful fillment of that pledge must by delayed. Concerning the Philippines tbe presi dent boldly announces that independ ence is not to be thought of. He says the future of those islands rests with congress, and then he proceeds to pre sent reasons why congress should take no action on the. subject. The presi dent's message is well described by the sentence "a plea for gold and empire." It provides confirmation for the charge that imperialism is the administration's policy, and it completely shatters the hopes expressed by many republicans that ihe administration would not oommit itself to an un-American policy. The American people who fa", a ••conquest of the PhilinpiT"5 Islamic and ,/the substitution ot i_iupuo the republic of the fathers, and call it ex pansion, are the laughing stock of in telligent men throughout the world. All fully developed men know that the American forces are in the Philippine Islands for the purpose of advancing the interest of an American syndicate who have formed a co-partnership with a British syndicate to build railroads in China. If this syndicate should abandon its purposes in China we would soon find a way to give the Philippines 'their independence. A powerful syn dicate of multi-millionaires, less than fifty in number, are controlling the administration, and forcing the over throw of the republic and the establish ment of an imperial government. Ex pansion as understood, advocated and practiced in America under Jefferson, Monroe and other means the acquisition of lands upon which to build American homes, and out of which to construct new commonwealths. To invade over populated Asia is not expansion. It is madness. Bussel Sage recently said that Sec retary Gage's purchase of 125,000,000 worth of bonds saved the financial world from a disastrous panic. Upon what a magnificent foundation our financial system must be builded when, in the midst of' 'unparalleled prosperty,' little prop of $25,000,000 is necessary to hold it up. Mr. McKinley now has congress on his hands, and congress has Mr. Roberts on its hands, and Mr. Roberts has three wives on his hands. This seems to be a great time for hand, outs. Methuen will not be able to whip any considerable number of Boers until the British censor quits killing them by cable and allows a few live ones to wander about. IB may be that Buller is waiting for Bore Boers to ike the field, the censors hiving killed off the first installment. 

WON'T TELL THE TRUTH. More Time Given to Misrepresenta tion Than to Helping Soldiers. Dakota Ruralist, Aberdeen: The re publicans seem never so happy as when lying about Governor Lee. By con temptible tactics they captured the Huron meeting, called to arrange for the return of the First regiment, and made all the committees almost solidly republican. Then fearing they could not raise the required funds they asked the governor to call a special session of the legislature, which he very prop erly refused to do. The money was raised by the county boards, all parties working harmoniously, the xqoney be ing turned over to the republican com mittee, as a sacred trust. The only hitch that occurred was where the funds of two or three southern coun ties" got tied up in a republican bank, which has since failed. From the time money was raised the whole affair was grossly mismanaged. No contract was made till the regiment was mustered out and the boys were kept at their own expense at San Francisco after being mustered out. They were sent home without any arrangements for feeding en route, so that the actual cost to many of the boys was more than if they had paid their own fare. Further more a part of the baggage was lost en route. This mismanagement was vdue mainly to Chairman Frank Brown. And now Mr. Brown has the nerve to tell returned soldiers that the commit tee is out of funds and that one reason of this is that Governor Lee subscribed $600 which he refused to pay! When it was proposed to call the legislature together, Governor Lee said if the money was raised by sub scription he would head the list with |500. Following is the correspondence: "Sioux Falls, S. D., Aug. 25, 1899.— Hon. Andrew E. Lee, Governor of South Dakota, Vermillion, S. D.: Hav ing issued the call for the Huron con vention parties through the state are urging us to unite in a request to you to call a special sesion of the legisla ture to appropriate funds to meet nec essary expenses in bringing our regi ment home. We earnestly request such action and in so doing we believe we voice the wish of the people of our state. —H. H. KEISH, President Business Men's League. —Geo. Schlosser, Secretary." "Vermillion, S. D., Aug. 25,1899. H. H. Keith, President Business Men's League, Sioux Falls, S. D.: There are several things to be considered in call ing a special session. First is there an actual necessity that would warrant calling it second,is there sufficient time also, can the legislature legally ap propriate money for this purpose. These questions must be determined first. My opinion is that the necessity for calling a special session does not exist. There are two way open to raise this money quickly. One that men in each county guarantee amounts in pro portion to population of the' county. The other to raise it by general sub scription. I will give five hundred dol lars if the remainder" can be raised without calling a special session. Will guarantee our proportion from this county. 

—ANDREW E. LEE." The funds were not raised by sub scription and Clay county gave her full proportion. Futhermore, when two returning soldiers applied to Mr. Frank Brown for a re-fund of fare paid by them selves, it was telegraphed from this city, presumably on the authority of Mr. Brown, that he had arranged for a half-fare rate for invalid soldiers and this arrangement had been cancelled by the governor. This arrangement was not made by Mr. Brown but by the governor and has not been cancelled by anybody, and the correspondence prov ing this was in the hands of Mr. Brown at the very time the lying dispatches were sent out from this city. If Mr. Brown did not authorize the dispatch es, he should have been man enough, when he had the correspondence in his own hands, to correct them. He and his committee have wasted $7,000 of the tax payers' money to make a show for McKinley and possibly hope to es cape criticism by lying about the gov ernor. When the governor was in San Fran cisco the Red Cross society proposed to him to send home at half rates tbe boys who were left behind in the hos pital after the departure of the regi ment. The offer was accepted as will be seen from the following letter written by the governor at 'Frisco: "San Francisco, Cal., September, 1899.—Mrs. F. G. Sanborn, Chairman Transportation Committee. Dear Mad am- You are hereby authorized to provide transportation for all soldiers of the First South Dokota Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, who may be discharged from hospitals after the departure of the regiment for South Dakota. I will guarantee the expenditures necessary and incidental to the point of enlist ment. Personally and on behalf of the members of the regiment I beg leave to extend to you and the ladies who have so devotedly interested them selves in the welfare of the soldiers, our appreciation and thanks for their noble efiorts. Very respectfully, —"ANDREW B. LEE, "Governor of South Dakota." It clearly appears from this that the governor instructed the Red Cross peo ple to send sick soldiers home at the half rate and that he personally guar anteed the society against loss on that account. Concerning the discharged soldier who paid full fare the following letter from Mrs. Sanborn fully explains *«San Francisco, Cal., Sept. 19, 1896. Hon. Andrew E. Lee, Governor of South Dakota. Dear Sir: Wm. G. Stewart, discharged from the First south Dakota Vols., came to us for re duced rate for transportation. This was before we had secured our present rate, and hoping we might be able to do something for him in the way of re duced transportation he waited a few days, visiting some friends at Penryn, California. From there he wrote me and as I did not get the letter prompt ly he purchased at Sacramento a sec ond class ticket to Sioux City for $40. He will ask you to refund him this amount, and as he is a poor lad in broken health, I am happy to know that you will see that South Dakota re imburses him. His discharge paper will not bear the railroad stamp that is placed on tickets and discharges when soldiers' transportation is pur chased in the S. P. office here. But knowing all the circumstances we will guarantee that he paid $40 for his tick et. Hoping to be of substantial service to the boys you are leaving behind in the hospital, yours veay truly, —MRS. F. G.
