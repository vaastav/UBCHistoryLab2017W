Under it is article amendmens liave been proposed by two-thirds of bolli Houses of Congress, and hnvo been 'ratified bv j the Legislatures of threc-fowrtlw of tlio! several states,' arid liavo consequently be- j come parts of the Constitution. To tliis j process tho country is imh-bted for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion. or abiidgitig tbe freedom of speech or of the press, or of the right of petition. 'Jo this we are aUo, indebted for tho Iiill of Rights, which secures the people against any abuse of power by tho Federal Gov- '< eminent. Such wcro tlio apprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State Rights at that period as to have rendered j it extremely doubtful whether the Constitu- j tion could have long survived without these j amendment?. Again, the Constitution was amended by the fame process after the election of J'refi- j dent Jefferson by tho House of Kepresen- [ tatives, in February, 1S03. This nmend-i inent was rendered necessary to prevent a I recurrence of the dangers which has seri- j ously threatened the existence of Government during the pendency of that election. The nrtie'e for ii own amendment wneint-ended to aeenre t:ie amicable adjustment of conflicting coiir.titu1ioii.il O'^slions like the mvipni which might ari-e between (lie governments of 1 lie Slates and tlsit of the United States. This appears from contemporaneous history. In 111 is connection, I cliall merely csill attention to a few sentence* in Mr. Madison's j<?*lly celebrated report, in 17'.'*.', to tlie Legislature of Virginia. l:i tin's lie ably and conclusively defended the resolution# of the preceding Leg jsbiture against the Btrictures of several other fctate Legislatures These were nviinly founded upon the protest of the Virginia Legislature against the ! "Alien and Sedition Acts," as "palpable infrnetions of she Constitution." In pointing out tiie peaceful ai.d constitutional remedies, and hu referred to none other, to which the St?tes were authorized to resort, on such occasions, he eons-hides hy say in?, "thai the legislatures of the .States might have made a direct representation to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts, r tin v miirht 11:ivo ?? 11...:- ?? 1 live Senators in Congress their wish thnt twothirds thereof would propose nit explanatory nirsMiilini'ril. to the Constitution, or two-thirds ?>f l!u-:.iSfIveP, if Mich La i I - t-ii their option, might. by an applicuti'in to (fbngrvss. have obtained a t' ouvention for the same object." This i# the very coiuso which I earnestly recomr.ieud in order to obtain an "explanatory amend en'.' of the Constitution on the subject v .-iuvoiv. This might originntc with Congress or the .Stoic Legialeturrs, as may bo deem- ' od most advisable to attain the object. The explanatory amendment might be confined to the final settlement of the true construction of the Constitution on three special points: 1. An express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the states where it low exists or may hereafter exist. 2. The duty of protecting this rij.ht in *11 the common Territories throughout their territorial exintencc, and until they shall be admitteed as States into flie Union,' with or without slavery, as their Constitutions may prescribe. o V 1 -1- - ?. use reco^ni'ion < f the master to liavo hi? slivc, who has escaped from one Stale to another, restored and "delivered up" to him and of (lie validity of the fugitive slave law . enacted for this pun^e, together with a declaration that all State laws impairing or defeating this right are violations of the Con titution, and are consequently null and void. It may pe objected 4hal thin *nnaWK?i>nn the Constitution lias already been settled by tlic Supreme Court of the United States, and wlint. more might to be required? The answer is. that n very largu proportiou of the people of the Ui.ite'd States still contest the correctness of this decision, nml never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force until clenrly established by the people of the severul States in theii sovereign eharaetcr. Such an explanatory amendment would. ,it is believed, forsvt r terminate the existing dissensions and restore peace and hnrtiiony unions the States. It ou?ht not to be doubted that such an appeal to the arbitrament established bv the Constitution itself would be received with favor by ull the States nf !>?

In mj fir*t annual Message I promised to employ my best exertions, in co-operation with Congio^s. to rcduce tlie expenditures of the Government within the limits of a Iriso and judicious cconoiny. An overflowing treasury had produced habits' ot prodigality and extravagance which could only be gradually corrected. Tho work required both tinie and patience. I applied myself diligcully to this ! task from the beginning, nnd wan aided by the | nKl-v ~..a ui.u rnergeiic ciroris pr the hcAds,of the different Kxccutive Departments The result of our labors in this good cause did not appear in iho sum totnl r\f our expenditures for life first two years, mainly in .consequence of llie extraordinary expenditure necessarily incurred j in the Utah, expedition, nnd the very large! amount of the contingent expenses of Congress I during this period. Theso greatly exceeded the pay and tuHonge of the members. For the yMr ending 80th Ju..e, 18-"?8, whilst tho pay ami mileage amounted to $1,480,214, Iho contingent expenses rose to $2,098,300.70, and f?r the year ending 0th June, 1850, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to $860,008.06, the contingent expenses amounted Iq $1,431,603.78. I am happy, however, to bo able to inform you that during the last fiscnl year ending oi^ the 30th June, 1800, the total expenditures of tUe Government In all its branches?legislative, executive and judicial?exclusive of the publie debt, were reduced to tlie sum of $65,402,465.40. This concltmlvMw ' 11 -v iruui books of lhe Treasury. In the ye*r ending on the 00th June, 1858, the total expenditure, exelusive of the public debt, amounted to $71, 901,129.77, and thaUfor the year ending filOth June, 1859, to $(>6,340,226.18. Whilst the books of the Treasury show an acfoal^bxpendlture of $60,848,474.72 for the'year ending eto the OOlb June, I860, including!|1,040,007.71 for tfuMonti^ent expenses of Congroes, there must-bifTdedueed from thfs amount the ram of $4,290,w9.20, witfc the interest -upon it of $l50,p00, appropriated by the Act of l?th February, i860, ' for the purpose of supplying j the deficiency in the reranues and defraying the expenses of the Post Ofece Department for the year ending the AOth of June, 1869." This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to the year 185u must be deducted from the sum of $60,' 848,471,72, in order to ascertain the extendi-, ture for the year ending on the&Oth June, I860, which leaves a balauc#/or the oxpenditures of that year of $55.40*2.4?). 46* The, lnt*fe?t on the public debt, Inoludlflf Trea?rtify noles fhr - . . r* r."

It ought in just ice to be observed ihnt. several of tl:o estimates from Hie departments for the year ending UOth June, 1W>0, were reduced by Congress below what, was anil still is deemed compatible with the public interest. Allowing a liberal margin of "jOO, 000 for this reduction, ami for other toattses, it may be safely asserted that the sum of $01,000,000 or at the most' $02,000,(>00, is amply sufficient to administer (be government and to pay the inter est on llic public debt, unless contingent events should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary. The result bus boon attained in a considerable degree by the appropriate departments in euteriug into public contracts. 1 have myself never interfered with the award of any such contract except in a single ease, with the Colonization Society, deeming it advisable to cast the whole responsibility in cnch case ou the proper head of the department, with the general inmriiotinn tkut tli?on t?nnfr??du "I"'"''1 -1 ?.I? gi*cn to the lowest ami best bidder.

^KZSIDENT'S MEBBAOE. We^mbl ?"r present issue tliat portion of the i'retiiltnri Messagc which u-lut-cs to our Federal Relations, and which in the present crisis will be found peculiarly intcrestiug.? : Like everything which come* from the pen of I Mr. Buchanan, it in un uhle production, ilistiiii guitheJ by clearness utid prevision of htuteinent, and a thorough familiarity with the . principles and details of the <jue6tions discussJ ed ; but n desire to harmonise opposing doc; tlines and reconcile conflicting interests seems I to hove led the President into inconsistences , which are very uppureni, and which have : been fully exposed in the public journals of i the country. The President denies to a Slnto | the Constitutional right to secede, nml yet I affirms that the General (iovernment luis j no right to coerce a seceding State. The , propositions seem Jo lie entirely incompatible, j If secession l>e .1 violation of Constitutionnl ' right, a rebellion against constituted authority i niul (^revolutionary ri'ointimoo.tlioii ttin ( nrrnl j liovermneni must iiNofim ilv powrw lli? |>owi'r to protect itself against these infringement* of ' its Constitutional rights?the remedy must bo concurrent wilh the right. Secession is either n Count it xi t ionnl <>r Hovohitioniu v light. T?? I hold thnt the right is Krvolulionarv. and itt j the same time to deny t?> the tJovernment the I right to ijueil rebellion is a contradiction in | terms?nn absurdity. The President nlit>\v? clearly that the Constitution has veMed mi I!??< ' General Government no power to coerce a soceding Stole, and beside* that its cxei-cUr would chango the essential chnraeter of this Government, and be at war wilh the whole spirit and intent of the Constitution?the eon 1 elusion is therefore irresistible thai this is not ' a consolidated Government, hut a compact liej twceii sovereign powers, with the reserved right in eouh Slate to determine its infraction*, ami the mode and measure of redress. The Message seta forth in a striking point of I view the dark catalogue of onr wrong*?concedes that the most palpable violations of Constitutional duty have been committed by the acts of different State Legislatures to d.*feat the fugitive slave law?and admits that the injured States having exhausted all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redres*, would be justified ill resistance to the Government of the Union. The peaceful remedy suggested is an explanatory amendment of the Constitution, which should settle ils construction on three points?1st. The right of slavery in the States; 2d. The duty of Congress to protect i* in the Territories; 3d. A recognition of the right of the master to his fugitive sluvv.. But suppose that these concessions were made, j would they satisfy the South? Would they give any increased security to the institution ? I Would they put a stop to that ceaseless agita! tion of the slavery question, which according to the statement of Uic Message itself, lins in spired the slave himself with vague notions of freedom, and excited the worst feara of servile insurrection ? It is preposterous to expect that any su?.-li parchment stipulations, would weigh a feather with the misses, or stay the onward progress of abolitionism. Emancipation is the great end of the 1'epublican party, and the openly avowed policy of its leaders. All concessions to slavery are mere temporary expedients to effect the final doom of slavery. Our State lias realized the greatness of tho peril, long ago, and has only awaited the co-operation of her sister States ; and now that co opernlinn ic .it. Imnrl tlin la nrnnnrn.l I ? -I"*' "" ?? ??" j only step, which is consistent with her honor j and interest. The whole South awaits her action, in the full confidence that she will act ! promptly. It its this coufiOeucn which i? ' giving strength to the secession movement, and which must finally unite the Cotton States in : a Southern Confederacy. Eutcrtaining the views which the President j has expressed in the Message that the General : Government has no light to use force against I il ftfrpflillfT nf A if WAtilil oa""' ?IiaI ? with liis atfminislralion is uot very probable, j It would naturally occur ftom an attempt oil his part to enforce the collection of the Ilevj etiue or to increase the strength of the Federul I Fortifications, but this wc suppose he 'will by I all mean? avoid. The question of their cession will be referred to Congress, and upon its action will depend the question of peace and war. Mr. Hale and others have threatened co-ercion, but this is suppoted to be mere bluster to test the feeling of Southern members. Senator Davis end other well informed Statesmen, do not apprehend civil war. THE

"If there will be a secession of the cotton States, I propose, first, to help them defend the same if necessary ; and, second, to open a direct import trude from Mobile or Charleston with France and Englaud. Thus I propose to recommence life in the Southern Confederacy, if only one is declared. I have property here valued at $45,000 in 1856, that I cannot sell now for anything, as on account of my political ideas of slavery and Southern rights, I ant couutcd as fanatical as you would consider Garrison or Sumner.
