The recent Electoral dinner in Richmond attracted .sonic attention, and in particular quarters far more than it ought to have attracted at this particular time. For instance, the NewYork "Tribune," through its "special reporter," n?,1 Fi'-ilitipu fur hcarinp- and reDOrt- I \>?td lUHM^.v^ * " ' O A ing, which were withheld from the Richmond Enquirer;" arid thus, from a Black Republican newspaper of New York we have to learn what was said at an Electoral dinner in Richmond. The report of the dinner in the Richmond "Whig," compared with that of the "Tribune," was most meagre and indifferent. The "Tribune" not only had a "special reporter," but Greeley himself devotes an editorial to the great occasion. The "Tribune" says: "Wc devote p. large space in our paper this morning to a report of the proceedings at a public dinner given to the Presidential Electors of the Suite of Virginia, at Richmond, on Thursday evening last. As the expression of leading men in the party which has just carried the election in that State, the speeches at this dinner merit particular attention. The render will find in them no utterance of disloyalty to the Constitution, no sign of sympathy with the mad and suicidal purposes of the Cotton States. The remnrks of Mr. Bo'.ts, especially, present the argument against secession with a luminous force that has nowhere been surpassed, and the other speakers, without exception, exhibit a spirit of patriotism and a determination not to be forced by South Carolina into a fauil revolution, which will tind appreciation in every true American heart. "Wc are not surprised, of course, to perceive in these speeches a degree of misunderstanding. and even of misrepresentation, as regards the spirit and policy of the Republican party. That is natural, perhaps, in the circumstances, and Will soon be remedied after the new Administration has come into power. But one thing is now doubly certain, and that is that the Union party of Virginia will not in any event prove unfaithful to the Constitution, or take tin a position of hostility to its legal operation." Of course Greeley makes Mr. Botts the great man of the occasion, specially mentioning his "luminous force." No other speaker is noticed by the "Tribune," which is quite a slight to J. J. Jackson, Jr., who said: "Jfy father has lo3t in Oberlin. Ohio, one hundred thousand dollars xcorlh of negroes, and yet the sentiment which lie has taught me is, live or die, survive or perish, we go for the Union and the Constitution." Mr. Greeley might have returned a short editorial notice to Mr. Jackson for the "$100,000 worth or negroes" which Greeley urged the Oberlin people to steal. We were not before aware that any one citizen of the Southern Stales had suffered to the extent of $1'.>0,000. No notice is taken by the "Tribune" of the strong Southern speeches tnado by Mr. Bruce, of Halifax, and Mr. B. H. Shackelford, of Fauquier. Botts, and Botts only, had "luminous force" on that occasion. The "Tribune" also says: ".Mr. Botts has written a letter against seces- { sion, which, we do not doubt, will lind an echo in many quarters, It does not propose that Virginia shall submit to South Carolina rather thnu to the Constitution of the United States. The -riowi it expresses are substantially thoen set forth in ?t< Kicriujoiia on ' Thursday last.*' <!> Abuse of SouiU Carolina. There are some politicians in Virginia whom South Carolina could not satisfy let her course be what it may. Last winter, when she sought conference, consultation and co-operation with Virginia, and deputed and sent her able and eloquent Commissioner to entreat Virginia to act in concert with tho Southern States, these men denounced South Carolina with unmeasured bitterness for seeking consultation and conference. And now when that State has acted for herself alone, not risking again the insult of rejected counsels, these same men denounce the State for not consulting Virginia. We predicted last winter that the rejection of the Conference would entail unnumbered woe? upon tho South and the Union; that when Black Republicanism had triumphed, South Carolina would not again ask conference, and that when the opponent* of Mr. Menuuimger's mission called for a Southern Convention South Carolina would not re" spond. All these things have come to pass. Most respectable opponents of the Southern conference last winter are the advocates of a Southern Convention now. Had they acted wisely then, the Union would now be in the enjoyment of peace and quiet. But they thought proper to spurn South Carolina in the hope of building up a Union party at the North, and when that has signally failed, these same men denounce South Carolina for not consulting them the second time. We refer to this rejection of tho conference li?t winter, not for the purpose of animadversion, but as warning to all parties, that errors of the past may he, as far as possible, redeemed in the future. The experience of the past may do much good, if wisely regarded by the approaching session of the Legislature. The continued abuse of South Carolina does no good 10 the cause of the UnioQ in Virginia.? On the contrary, it is calculated to arouse sympathy and feeling for her cause, and impels the people to use every e.veition to place Virginia by her side. Men may regret her position, (we do not,) and yet abstain from useless vituperation. Black Republicans at the North are at present fully engaged in this matter, and it would be well for newspapers at the South to 1 o t?irtnr?r\rVW' ,.f ?!1 chaK oKuca ' , icmc w 44.4.44. ? ?. -.4 -4.^..

Meeting in Caroline.?A meeting of the citizens of Caroline, without distinction of party, was held at the Court-house of the county 0:1 Monday last, to take into consideration the present condition of public affairs. Resolutions were unanimously adopted advocating the call of a State Convention, denying the right of the Federal Government to coerce a seceding State, and pledging themselves to make common cause in resisting any attempt at coercion.

?KWMW For the Fnqvirir. ? Havo tho Sontberri States a Slight to Secede T I The Abolitionists and their allies in the 1 Sorthetn and Eastern States, have been en- t gaged for more than twenty years in the most ^ cruel, unnatural and unholy warfare upon the I peace, safety and property of the Southern 1 States, disturbing their repose, and endanger- * ing sometimes the lives of their people, and t seeking, by all tho means at their command, to destroy the tenure by which the}' hold the j most Valuable portion of their property.? < Their preachers, presses and politicians have 1 habitually denounced the people of the South 1 as a nation of sinners, in the daily practice of I iniquity, because of the existence of African ' slavery among them. Our slaves have been 1 excited to insurrection by the denunciation of 1 their owners and the denial of the title of their owners. Men have been instigated to invade 1 our soil and slay our people, and their leader, 1 who, in conformity to law, expiated his erimos ( upon the gallows, has been treated as a martyr 1 and honors paid to his memory. Our slaves 1 have been enticed to abscond, and then forci- ' bly withheld from us, in violation of all souud j morality, the comity of friendly States, and 1 the-provisions of the Constitution, which were 1 designed to protect the rights and property of ' the South. The cqualitj' of the South in the Union has bt en ' * ' 1 * 1.x ?lw, I I denied, ana proclamation nas uuen mauv mil. the Territories, whicli are tiie common property of all the States, shall be appropriated hereafter exclusively to the use of a part of them,and shall 1 never be enjoyed by the people of the South unless they renounce slavery; although the largest and most valuable Territory, yet to be settled, lies deep in the South, below the ? parallel of latitude?and its occupation by an anti-slavery population will be utterly incoin- I patiblc with the safety of the South. Until finally, it has been announced, that the country ; cannot exist half free and half slave; that the 1 conflict, therefore, between the friends and cue- : mies of the institution of slavery is irrcpressi- : ble and must be continued until one or the other shall be exterminated; and upon this platform of irrepressible and perpetual enmity to us and our institution, which is inseparably connected with our moral, social and political existence, an obscene man has been elected to the Presidency, because, and only because, he has made himself notorious by the avowal of his enmity to us, our rights and institutions, and is regarded as the author of the maxim, that the conflict between slavery and its opponents, is irrepressible. With the election of this man to the Chief Executive oflicc of the Union, in which he will be the Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, comes another proclamation from the party which elected him, and their allies, that they have the right and the power to compel us, by force, to submit to any laws which they may pass; and we know that they already have the control of the House of Representatives aud will have undisputed control of the Senate as soon as the elections, soon to occur, shall be made in Pennsylvania and California; and when Kansas and Nebraska or either shall be admitted into the Union, their power will be still farther increased. Nay, they^ulready have control of the Senate; for if the Senators from South Carolina were in their seats the vote of Douglas, our enemy, would decide everything, and of course, decide against us. But without the Senators from Carolina, the power is complete, without an appeal to the lesser Lincoln, from Illinois. For this war upon them, the Southern people have given no provocation. The puritanical pretext for it, has been, and is, abhorrence to African slavery as it exits in the Southern States. But for this, if it were a sin, instead of a blessing, as it is, the Southern people are, to say the least, not moro culpable than those of the North, who participated most actively in introducing slaves into this country, and when they found it no; profltable to keep tbetn, though no sin to import them, they sold what they had to the Southern people; and the Constitution acknowledges and guarantees outproperty in them. Our institution of slavery is not, therefore, a provocation ofl'ered by us to the people of t!u> North, aud no other provocation is pretended, for the South has never, at utiy time, made | any attempt to interfere witli llic institutions | of the North, or to.deprive them of their equal rights-in the Union; and therefore we speak the truth only, when we say that the South has offered no provocation lor this cruel and unnatural warfare upon her?this determination to degrade tho South, then impoverish, if not depopulate her, and finally, govern her as a mere province. This condition of things has naturally and necessarily aroused and deeply excited the Southern people, and calls upon them to say, deliberately and explicitly, how thev will meet it. Whether they will tamely submit to it, and, in advance, consent to and invite the humiliation, degradation, oppression and ruin whicTi is ioic?..? it, under the government which will exist on and after the 4th of March next, or will resist and anticipate and prevent ibcm. In tny opinion, honor, pride, patriotism, the love we bear our wives and children, the duty to protect them, and all the instincts of sellpreservation, command us to resist It is said by some that the election of Lincoln is not sufficient cause for resisting, and we must wait for an overt net. lint this doctrine is, I submit, founded in a total misconception of the case and want of just perception of the concrete ill which the election of Lincoln presents, and of the meaning of the | very thing which tho objectors call for, to wit: an overt act We do not complain that the J people of the non-slavcholding States have, by [ their numerical superiority, elected a President, although it has bccen their pleasure to select a "Rail Splitter" for that high station, nor should we complain if they had elected a non-slaveholder who does not approve slavery, if they had selected one who is so far kind that he is capable of being just to us, and will not violate tho Constitution and his oath in order to do us injury. When wc behold, however, a warfare of twenty years continuance, (and more,) unprecedented in modern times, among civilized nations, for its violence, malignity and disregard of social, moral and constitutional obligations, culminating in the election to the chief executive oflice of the nation of a man, who lias evinced no fitness or qualification lor it, and is unknown to fame by any act or speech which should commend him as .:.i? i.:.? i.? an BiUUipie, Ui' 

VI11IUV IIIUI IV pi vki uivui, utcausc he has made himself notorious by the avowal of the most implacable hatred to us and our institutions, with a denial to us of any Constitutional protection. The man and all thought of him are merged in the representative ; and two conclusions present themselves in bold relief and with startling effect. The first is that the spirit of aggression has not subsided or abated, but has increased and become moro violent; and the second is that it controls the government and has the power to execute its will and gratify its malignity and has selected its leader with a view to the gratification of its hatred, and the consummation of its purpose of degrading and disfranchising the South. As the bravest is always selected to lead a storming part}', the wisest to counsel and the most eloquent to speak, so the party leader is chosen, not because he differs with his party, but because he concurs and concurs fully with it; and terrible is the wrath which it pours upon hitn when he fails or refuses to use the power which the party has conferred upon him for its benefit and according to its maxims; and rarely, too rarely, unfortunately are party leaders found who can or will distinguish between their country and their party, unless it be to serve the party, and not the country. The recent divisions in the South unhappily furnish both argument and illustration upon this subject, which cannot be made stronger or more striking. Are the anti-slavery men and abolit'onisia of the North more exempt from frailty than the party men of the South? Those who counsel us to wait for the farther action, the "overt net," as they term it, of Lincoln and his party, in the hope that he will betray them and transfer the quarrel from us to them, deceive themselves, and would, therefore, mislead, fatally mislead, I lie South. Would they counsel us to arm a madman in the hope that reason would return, before he pulled the trigger? Would they commit themselves, without protection, to the mercy of the I highwayman and assassin ? Would tli'ev com- i -i? 1?l- ?- Ik.. ?...ir .1 ? I ,i.?, I

Would they advise the watchman to wait until the torch of the incendiary has been actually applied and the house is in Ilames before he raises a cry or attempts to arrest the offender? All will answer, no 1 How then is it that the people of the South arc asked to commit themselves to the tuercv and discretion of fanatics, who for more than twenty years j have been seeking the power, which they have now acquired, for the purpose of accomplishing Southern ruin by it? If there was wisdom in trusting yourself, at any time, without proper guards, to the mere}or forbearance, or returning sense of justice, of your enemy, though he was neither a fanatic ir n knave, what wisdom or prudence can there ic in committing the South to the mercy of a Slack Republican and Abolition government, n the hope that Lincoln, the elected Chief of he party, will change his and their policy tovards us, when the hope is founded on the immtation that he is a knave, who for the pur)ose of getting into power, professed principles vhich he did not entertain, or, entertaining hem, lie will now betray, both his principles tnd his party? If the friends of a knave canlot safely trust him, how shall his enemies do I? But in my opinion, there is no ground for he supposition that Mr. Lincoln intends to ibandon the prineiples which he and his part}jave professed and betray his party; and if here was, it would only prove the folly of reving on the promises and professions of such i man. i believe, therefore, that the Black Republican and Abolition party, will, as soon is it is invested with the power of the Government, turn it upon us, first, for the purpose of :arrying out its principles in the form of law. ind then, of compelling obedience to them bv force, if they can, with the advantage of being ible to say, that wc have submitted to their government with a knowledge of their principles, arid resistance to their laws is, therefore, treason; and, with our people distracted, disheartened and torn, by internal factions, when tliev lind themselves involved in a dilemma, I.-1.I..I, .nnbnc Ml.mi ii-iitniv tn tile Ft'dcral GoV eminent, if they obey the State, and traitors lu the State, if they obey the Federal Government. It is not difficult to foretell the fate of a people thus distracted and divided, in the laco of a united, powerful and vindictive foo. In in}- opinion, therefore, the Southern States should, without delay, withdraw from the present Confederacy and form a new one, in which their people will be safe from the aggressions of their enemies, and may enjoy their property, in peace, surrounded by plenty. 1 should content myself on this point, with this expression of opinion, in the conviction that, ut this day none could be found to deny the right of the people of a State, to "alter or abolish the form of their Government" whenever it shall be found to be destructive of their rights and liberty. But, admonished, as we are by -Mr. Douglas in his Norfolk speech, and by the President in his late extraordinary message, that there are persons who deny the right of one, or all, of the Southern States to withdraw from the present Confederacy of States, and that the great authority of Madison is invoked to sustain it, 1 deem it respectful and proper to submit some of tlie reasons, which sustain my opinion. And, first, I refer to the history of the Constitution. In the convention, which framed tiie Constitution, Mr. Patterson, of New Jersey, expressed the opinion that a compact formed by unanimous consent could be dissolved, only by unanimous consent. Mr. Madison denied the doctrine?saying that it does not result from the nature of compact, and that "a breach of the fundamental principles of the compact, by apart of the society would certainly absolve the other part from their obligations to it. II the breach of any article by any of the parties does not set the others at liberty, it is because the contrary is implied, in the compact itself, and particularly by that law of it which gives an implied authority to bind the whole in all cases. This latter circumstances shows that we are not to consider the Federal Union as analogous to the social compacts of individuals; foi if it were so, a majority would have a right ti bind the rest,and even form a new Constitution, which the gentleman from New Jersey wouh! be among the last to admit." If we consider lh? Federal Union as analogous,not to the social compacts among individual men, but to the con volitions among Stales, what is the doctrin<?re suiting from the convention ? Clearly,according to the exposition of the law of nations, that n breach of any one article by any party "leaves nl ?!?.. -.tltAf. nai-lioc nt lihcrtC tfl consider tilt whole convention as dissolved, unless thej choose rather to compel the delinquent to re pair the breach. In some treaties, indeed, it h expressly stipulated that a violation of particular articles shall not have this consequence, and even that particular articles shall remain it force during war, which is, in general, understood to dissolve all subsisting treaties. 1 tut, are there any exceptions of this sort in the articles of confederation ? So far from i! there is not even an express stipulation thai force shall be used to compel an of lending member of the Union to discharge its duty. And in the 21st number of the Federalist which was an elaborate exposition of the Con stitution by A! tnder Hamilton, John Ja\ and James if tdison, over the signature o "Publius," written with the view to comment the'Constitution, Mr. Hamilton says: "Then is no express delegation of authority to compe delinquent members; and if such a righ should he ascribed to the Federal head, as re suiting from the nature of the social compac between the Stales, it must be by inference ant construction, in the face of that part of tin i . u.i. ?* itivti iv in tirciairu %.%?% each State shall retain every power, jurisdiction and right not delegated to the Unitec States in Congress assembled."' Mr. lhtmil ton then proceeds to argue that the defect h the articles of confederation, produced by the restricting and reserving clause, was properlj omitted in the Constitution, and therefore thi power to coerce "delinquent members" ex isted. Hut, by the tenth amendment to the Consti tution, this restricting and reserving clausi was restored, and, therefore, by the admissiot of both Mr. Hamilton and -Mr. Madison, tin power to control and coerce "delinquent mem bers" does not exist. Is there any one of tin .1. 1.!l?n;|,ftn present uuv iuvmv;ui/ii; uitvi iiuiuiiwn ison, or any Federalist more devoted thai Hamilton!'' Who will he hardy enough t< claim for the Federal Government powers whicl Hamilton and Madison denied to it? Again: In the Mist number of "The Fede ralist," Mr. Hamilton says: "The State Gov ernments, by their original constitutions, nr invested with complete sovereignty;" and n the 32d number, he says "that an entire con solidation of the States into one complete na tional sovereignty would imply an entire sub ordination of the parts. I5ut as the plan of th Convention aims only at n partial union or con solidation, the State Governments would clear ly retain all the rights of sovereignty whicl they before had, and which were not, by tha act, exclusively delegated to the United States.' And Virginia, in her act of ratification of tin ' Constitution, declared, "in the name and 01 behalf of the people of Virginia, that the pow ; ers granted under the Constitution, being de rived from the people of the United States may be resumed by them whensoever the sanv shall be perverted to their injury and oppres sion, and that all power not granted thereby remains with them and at their will." And th 10th amendment of the Constitution, conform ing to i lie ratification by Virginia, express ly declares, as I have before stated, tha "the powers not delegated to the Unitei Stales by the Constitution, nor prohibited by i to the States, arc reserved to the States, rcspec lively, or to the people." And the govern ment of the United States has been recognize) by every department of it, including the Sn promt- Court, under the guidance of Marshal ami Taney, and by the people, as a govern uient of limited power, deriving its whole pow cr from the grants in the Constitution. Tt may bo safely affirmed then? I. That the Government of the Unitei States is not a consolicated, hut u confederated government of limited authority. II. That the violation of the Constitution bj one section absolves every other from its obh galioti to that Constitution, and the govern ment created by it. III. That the States have retained, and now possess, all the attributes of sovereignty which they have not exclusively vested in the gene vnl irftfuvninnnt IV. That there is no clause in the CotislitU' tion forbidding any State to secede from it, and no grant of power to the General Government, to make war upon any State, if she does secede, and compel her, l>y force of arms, to remain in the Union. From these positions the result seems to he inevitable and irresistible, that the States have u right to dissolve the Union, if they all, or a majority of them, agree to do so, and that when the compact or Constitution has been violated hy anv State, the other States, and each of them, has a right to declare that compact at an end, and withdraw from it. How can it he otherwise? That the States were originally sovereign is conceded hy all. That they have parted with a portion of that sovereignty, and retained all not parted with, is also conceded. That they have not. in terms, or by necessary implication, renounced the right to withdraw from the compact, and have not conferred upon the Federal Government power to declare war against or coerce a State, lias been fullv established. Is not the conclusion, then, irresistible, that a State has the right to secede from the Union whenever that Union becomes an oppressive and injurious bond to her; or its government, or the other parties to the Union pervert it to her injury, disregard its provisions, or otherwise treat her as an enemy ? But even this is not a full statement cf the i -- ' --I, , i argument in our favor, lor although the conclusion from the premises already stated is irresistible, still its propriety may be made yet more i apparent, by reference to other passuges in the history of the Constitution. In the Convention which formed the Constitution on the 20th day of May, 1787, Mr. Randolph offered a plan of a government in a series of resolutions, the Cth of which, after enumerating various powers which ought to be conferred on the Federal Government, concluded with these words, "and lo call forth the I force of the Union against any member of tlio ! Union failing to fulfil its duty under the artii clcss thereof." On the 31st of May, the resolutions of Mr. Randolph" being under consideration, Mr. Madison said "that the more he reflected on the use of force, the more he doubted the practicability, the justice, the efficacy of it when applied to people collectively and not individually. A union of the States containing such an ingredicntseotued to provide fur its own dei struction. The use of ffirce against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound. lie hoped thatsuch a system would be framed as might render this resource unnecessary, and moved that the clause be postponed. This motion was agreed t? mm con.?2 vol. Mad. papers, 732-7G1. At another time, on the Slh of June, be treated the idea of using force against a State as "visionary and fallacious." The subject was afterwards revived bv Mr. Patterson, of Xew Jersey, but it was repudiated i v." \t? iinmiifAi, ,ij "iuiMossible.'' as "a war be tween the parties, und a dissolution ni the Union will ensue."?p. SSI. It was subsequently brought up again incidentally, in a debate, when George Mason scouted it and said, "will not the citizens of the invaded States assist one another, until tbey rise as one man and shake oil" the Union altogether V' And he was followed and hacked by f.uther Martin; and the idea of coercing a Stale was not broached again. ; Thus it appears, not only that the power to coerce a State was not granted, but, when asked lor, was exprensly refuted. Can any man ilou bt now, even if we be the lowest and most slavish of the submissionists ? Will not the people treat the. iu:m who talks of coercing a State, as they would the successor of John Brown ? ll Mr. Madison ever did maintain contrary doc trine, in correspondence with Mr. Alex. Rives, at a later period of his life, it is to be ascribeo to the timidity and decay of age, and Mr. River may well regret that lie ever exposed his weak ness. Mr Buchanan, however, in that most re inarkable of all Presidential messages, whil< be concedes that there is no power of coercion denies the right ol secession. This is indcec the foundation of u new school of Rhetoric ni , well us of Political fithics. The Slate has iu right to secede and vet no power has the righl to prevent her from seceding! I had always understood that in a state of legal society there was a remedy for every wrong, and thai t ight ami duty were correlative, and, therefore : if I have no right to do a thing, it is my dutv not to do it, and some party or power ha; ! the right to prevent me from doing it o to punish toe for doing it. But it i ! immaterial to press that inquiry, because tl: . I material value of the right to secede is that I imposes the correlative obligation upon ever i one to permit secession, and if it be concedJ that there is no right to prevent it, by fori? I then it matters not whether in an ethical poil of view, secession is rightful or not, as whet! r 1 rightful or not, it Is peaceful, and if peace!', " it is immaterial whether it is rightful so fans . the other States are concerned. But if i is ; not to be peaceful, then it is of the gravest nl portancc to show that it is rightful, as I l.vc ! shown, and to point out the ill consequent of surrendering the right, which I will d in ' another chapter, with your leave.

A CtTlZEX. Thirty-Sixth Congress-Second Session. \ Wednesday, December 12, lSf.ii. SENATE. I Mr. Bigler offered amendments to Mr. Mor- ; i rill's tariff' bill, which were referred with the j i bill. 1 Mr. Hunter, from the committee on linancc, ! reported a bill for the payment of outstanding claims by the issue of treasury notes. Amended by inserting fifty instead of pne hundred j dollars; and an amendment deferring the Hate j fixed for the expiration of the loan, and the j interest allowed. The proceeds of the sales of j the public lands to be set apart as security for i j the redemption of the notes. A debate ensued on these amendments, finally, an amendment reducing the amount i of the ten million loan bill to three millions j prevailed, and the bill, as thus amended, was j passed by the Senate. The resolutions relative to the crisis in the alfiirs of the confederacy were taken up?Mr. F</)t in the chair. MY. Wigfail commenced by saying:--During tlif speech yesterday of the Senator from lllincis, (Mr. Douglas,) he indulged some patriotic platitude on the subject of saving the L'nion. I understood him to say that he was prepared trmako any effort in his power to accomplish that desirable end. He asked for a specification of the wrongs or imaginary wrongs the Southern States were suffering, or supposed to be suffering. I understood him to pledge himself that when the grievances were made known he would be ready to redress them as far as lay I in Itis power. Under this state of things i stated to him the grievances under which the Southern States supposed they are suffering. it was that this government has denied that slaves are property, and upon that denial lias refused to protect the owners of slaves in their title whenever the* were within federal jurisdiction. 1 asked Mr. Douglas whether he was prepared to give assirance that our property would he protected vhen within federal jurisdiction. 1 did not iret i direct answer, and I suppose I will not He ays he will show an answer by his vote if iv b!V be introduced whether he will afford protec-ion or not. Will the Senator interlere bjr : legislative, executive or judicial department to pidect that species of property (slaves) as well 1 at any other specified property ? Will he propose amendments to the Constitution? Will | fj vote in this body for amendments to the 1 constitution? ' Will lie pledge his good faith to go back to ' ue people of Illinois and urge, before tlieui, tie ratification of the amendments to the eon" litution, and vest in the federal government 5 lot only the power, but make it an imperative luty, to protect slave property as it protects ' jvery other species of propeitv ! If he will do 1 that, then will end one of our difficulties. lie ' answers that there is no excitement in the ' Southern portion of the country; that we have ' not complained, and that the people are not ' dissatisfied, lie tells us that there are twoex' tremes. The people of the Hast and those who >j live ou the gulf misunderstand the ipie.-tion entirely. Ifut he says the people of Illinois and Kentucky understand it all. If the States North desire it, this Union can be saved; but litis Union is not to be saved by flattery, either on the floor of the Senate or from the slump. You can't cave the Union by singing Hosannas. You can't save it by making Fourth of duly speeches. You have got to corne down to the work and do something practically. The people of the different slaveholding States, especially the cotton States along the Gulf, are dissatified with the present * - - 1 i \i t\ government as auout 10 ne aumimsicrtu uy me incoming administration. There is nothing tint can satisfy them except by amending the constitution, and these amendments must be made by the Northern States unanimously, or they will not be sati.-lied, and 1 say here they ought not to be. If amendments to the Constitution which wonld secure us everything we asked were ratified by fifteen slave and ten non-slavcholding States, it would he considered part of the Constitution; but if tight non-slave States vote against it, and yet its ratification made it a part of the Constitution, we would say at once, here were amendments to the Constitution which were distasteful to eight non slaveholding States, and which they would probably disregard as they disregard the present Constitution. Suppose that amendments were proposed and fifteen slave States ratify them. Suppose also, that the nonslavcholding Status ratify them, but that New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and other border States refuse ratifications, why what practical use would they be to usV None! What is the use of discussing what we would he satisfied with, when nothing has been olfered us?? What is the use when we don't believe we will be permitted to restrain the Senators we ---have ? The Republicans deny that under the Coitsitiuuoii si.ifen .i.c iccugnizeir as property. If we could believe they would go to their constituents and urge the ratification of proper amendments, we believe the Gulf States would suspend their action. Certainly so, if the amendments be ratified and carried out in good faith. If they will cease preaching the irrepressible conflict doctrine anil decla: e slaves to be property ; that they shall be delivered up when demanded as fugitives; that abolition societies shall be abolished, and abolition papers be suppressed; that abolition speeches shall no longer be made, and that we shall not have pirates and murderers sent among our women and childrcu?when such an honest effort is made to meet the demands of the South there in a prospect of giving them a fair considornratinn. [Roars of laughter from the galleries and the republican Senators.] lie continued, saying : Senators may laugh in our faces. [Renewed laughter from the whole house.] My friends from Kentucky, Missouri, and other Union saving friends, may look ami sec derision depicted in their countenances when I mako this proposition. [Laughter.] 1 trust they will understand. The Latin maxim savs, "Learn even front your enemies some wisdom." I have told the people whom I represent, long, long ago, that they will not he permitted to keep that which they now have; that they arc regarded as poltroons, and that you talk of coercion, and of holding this glorious Union, as you call it, with cords of hemp. Vet you petition that this glorious Union shall continue. Stop within your borders those ti.miing presses and public speakers who excite the people against us. I say to those States that yen aha! I not?that's the word I choose to use, and I represent the feeling and determination of the people I represent?I say yon .-/mil not permit men to excite your citizens by making John Brown speeches and bringing strychnine within the limits of the State I represent. You shall not publish newspapers and pamphlets to excite our slaves to insurrection. You shall not publish newspapers and pamphlets to axcite non-slaveholders against llicslave. or slaveholder against, slaveholder. We will have peace, ami if you do not oiler it to u?, we will quidly have our rights under the constitutional compact, or withdraw from the Union, and establish a government for ourselves. If you then jo-rsist in aggression, these sovereign States will settle the Question, and when you laugh at these impotent efforts, little as vou regard them, f tell run einphati ? II.. .v.., ?.? i rr" i.. _ i cau>, mui miiim i?? iv ij i~au?tii?fr ;iu?i some applause in the galleries.] The President.?The sergeant-alarms will clear Ihc gallery if it occurs again. Mr. llale said?Mr. President, that threat j was made one, two or three times yesterday; I now is the time to carry it out. Mr. Wigfall said if the exhibition of feeling j in the galleries occurs again, they should be j I cleared, and once being chared we will pro- | | ceed. ! hope the Senate will act upon it; de- | | cenry is looked for. Mr. Wigfall resumed. I say cotton is King,-] and that cotton waves his sceptre not only over j thirty-three State?, hutover the Island ofGrent ! Britain, arid over Continental Europe. There | is no crowned head either upon that Island or Continent that does not bend the knee ' in fear, and acknowledge allegiance to her j power. j Five millions of people in Great Britain live : upon cotton. You may make short crops of; grain, and they can husband their supply : hut exhaust the supply of cutton one week, and all ; England will starve. They will not burst open barns, hut burn whole towns. We can direct the trade of two hundred and fifty millions to our own ports instead of Boston, Philadelphia, and Xcw York, if we go out of the L nion.? Our imports will amount to two hundred and fifty millions, and 1'urty per cent, upon that puts into our treasury one hundred million doliars ; twenty per cent gives fifty millions.? What tariff wc will accept I expect to know in i a few months and in another chamber.? [Laughter in the galleries.] When these eight cotton States withdraw j from the Union, as they will in the next two ' months, and meet in convention, and adopt a federal government, and establish a foreign department. I shall advocate the adopting o,*( that same constitution (hat was ratified by the f old thirteen States. 1 r I have no doubt that when Virginia, Tenncs- i d see, .Maryland, Kentucky aod other border S States see what we have done, they will como j a into the Union; and not many months wilt pass I r before this beautiful fabric will again be the j c scene of our discussion, and in which we will not i v only consider those matters pertaining to our a domestic affairs, but foreign relations. [Mr. : a W. here read extracts from the constitution and laws of South Carolina previous to the in- : t auguration of the first President of the United . p States.] The immediate cause of secession is j a the election of a l.lack Ilcpublican President, j v The people of the North must know the pre- j \ sent state of affairs is brought about by means j ii of the Helper book reading and the teachings ( i of the Senator from New York, the preaching j t of the followers, or rather pretended followers, j n of Christ, and the teachings in your schools of j your children to hato our institutions. The ; n Senator from New York told his AVide-Awako j i praetorians that their services could not be dis- j I pensed with after the election. They would j I be needed to secure the fruits of the victory. J A half million men in uniform are being drill- j t ed for the purpose of organization to sweep ; r the country in which I live with lire an>l j t sword. j d Mr. Wigfall continued for some time and the j t Scnaio adjourned. s IIOl'SE OF 

REPRESENTATIVES. n The Speaker, pursuant to the order of yes- s terday. called the States for the submission of li propositions relative to the present condition of r the country. 1 Nearly two dozen dil!vrcnt propositions were presented and referred to the special Union a committee. Many of them proposed amend- g ments to the Constitution on the shivery ijuestion, and all looking to conciliation. ii Mr. Thayer submitted a series of resolutions, h declaring, among other things, that the repre- o sentatives of the people regard it as a duty to forget all parties and sections, and devote themselves honestly and earnestly to the cause of '1 the country; that any citizens of this republic tl willing to barter the public welfare for their u own advantage, thus creating animosity bo- t: tween the States, are wholly unworthy of the n houor and confidence of the American people; S that the present unfriendly feeling which ex- c ists has arisen from the usurpations of Con- tl press and the Executive; that the rights of ri American citizens arc above Congress and the o President, and territorial governments should a not be compelled to derive their powers from w their consent; thut there shall he no legislation si whatever on the subject of slavery; that every o Congressional District shall be entitled to one tl Presidential Elector, and each State to two on ei general ticket. Mr. John Cochrane submitted e preamble de- C daring that a conflict of opinion, dangerous to p the peace and prosperity of the Union, has ai risen, concerning the true intent and mean- 1' ing of the Constitution relative to African ai slavery, and proposing amendments to the Con- hi stitution to the following effect: To establish c; a dividing line similar to the Missouri Compro- in mise, prohibiting Congress from passing laws vt interfering with the inter-State slave trade, or di the rights of slaveholders in transitu or tern- b porarily sojourning in nori slaveholding States, II and declaring that all State laws in any degree n impairing or infringing on the Fugitive slave C law are null and void. Mr. Adrian submitted a series of resolutions ri declaratory of the doctrine of non-intervention n< as the true remedy. That all State laws in tl cotdlict with the Constitution and laws of Con- St gress ought to he repealed. That the Fugitive tl: Slave law and all other laws of the land ought di te be rejected anil obeyed, and no ousiacic o thrown in the way of their execution. That the Constitution is the result of conciliation C and compromise, and can only be preserved by si tlnr exercise of a similar spirit. e: .Mr. Moti's, of Pennsylvania, ollercd a reso- g< lutiou instructing the Union Committee to in- w quire and report as to wether the State Per- S sonal Liberty bills are in conflict with the Con- si stitution, and further, to inquire whether the u fugitive slave law is susceptible of amendment ii so as to ascertain more cortainly the actual it condition of the fugitive. ii Mr. Stewart, of Maryland, offered a proain- n hie setting forth the principles 011 which the government is founded. That when it threat- ni ens to become destructive to the great ob- ti jeets which it was intended to accomplish, cv- ti cry State should he placed in a condition to ci provide for its own security; that there is vi good reason to believe that certain Slates ai arc about to withdraw from the Union, n and concluding with a resolution instructing ol the Select. Committee to inquire, among other things, whether any measure can be adopted a to preserve the Constitution in its purity and secure Southern rights. If this is not possi- ol ble, then as to a reasonable and just mode of ai settlement with the separated parts. Mr. Leake offered a resolution that the Conmay have no jurisdiction over the question of domestic slavery in the States and Territories, it District of Columbia, arsenals and dockyards; si that it shall be the duty of Congress efliciently f< and adequately to protect it by legislation where it exists; that no Territorial government has power to legislate with the subject; that 0 the right of master over a slave, while tempo- tt rarilv sojourning or in transitu through a noilshareholding State, shall be guarantied and Q " " ' 1.111.. 3 I! 1 ,r protected; that inquire slaves snau ue ueuvercu up or he paid for by the States in which they are rescued. Mr. Smith, of Virginia, offered a resolution instructing the Committee to inquire as to the policy of declaring out of the federal Union any member thereof, which may aim to nullify an act of Congress. Mr. Jenkins offered a resolution instructing the Committee to inquire as to the expediency of amending the Fugitive Slave Law, with a view to a prompt rendition of fugitive slavos i and a proper compensation to the owners of those not returned. Also the propriety of pro- i viding, by a Constitutional amendment or a j Congressional enactment, for the protection of * the rights of slaveholders in tiic common Territories, Ac. "j Mr. Cox submitted the following: J Jlesolred, That the Committee of Thirtythree, for the establishment of comity between the States, be required to consider what, if any, f further legislation is necessary to carry out the " second clause of the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution for the delivery of fugitives from justice who shall flee from -j one State and be found in another, on demand J of the Executive authority of the State from j! which such fugitive shall have fled. And that o such inquiry he tnade with a special view to " punish all judges, attorneys, generaK execu- L tive or other Stale officers, who shall impede F the execution of said clause of the Constitution, either in respect to the delivery of felons 0 who may he indicted for treason f,r murder in attempted slave insurrections, or who may he a indicted for slave stealing. c' Mr. ilutchius offered a resolution instruct- t? ing the Committee to report what legislation is t| necessary to give full i fleet to that part of the Constitution which provides that the citizens jj of each State shall he entitled to all the privi- k leges and immunities of citizens of tin; several ^ States; and also, what legislation is necessary ^ to secure to all people, whether residing or travelling through any State, the full benefit r.f o that part of the Constitution, which * u them against unreasonable searches and seiz ^ urcs in the absence of probable cause. hi Mr. Sherman offered a series of resolutions. that llit! only true and fllV-ctiv?- rcnioly lor tin* [I dissent ions tli:if now exist lie!ween liict several Stales ami tin- people thereof is the faithful observance hv ilie .several Stales aiitl the people w thereof of all iIn- compromises of the Cousti- j1,' lotion aii'l the In'A.s tnmie in pursuance thereof; in ami I hat the Spi-obil fmiuiiitieenf Thirty three ^ he instructed to riijiiiri* whether any State or t> the people thereof have failed to oliey anil en- f fori:-;- the obligations imposed hv the Constitu- jj lion, ami if so, the reason thereof, anti whether ki any legislation is reijnireil to secure such en- jjj foreeuieiit; that to avoiil all further controver- ? sies in regard to the several Territories of the ln United Slates, said Committee tliviile said Territories into States of convenient, size, with a C view to tlieir prompt admission into the Union J.' on nn equal footing with the original States.
