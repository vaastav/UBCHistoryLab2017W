Every year some one of the Senators adds a house to the number of tine buildings in tlie northwest part, of the city. It is the theory of most Sena tors that a Senator should keep house. It, isconsidereilniorudinniliuil, and it is held that a Senator can bet ter represent his State in a home of liisown in Washington than in a board ing-house or a hotel, lie is harder to reach and lives in more dignified se clusion. Some of the Senators have built too fine houses, and that fact has been used against them in their campaigns. Two Senators have built new houses during the last summer. The handsomest is that of Senator Palmer, of Michigan. It is now just completed. It is upon street fac ing Mcpherson Square. It has a front of brown stone und is four storic? above the basement. It was planned by Emerson, of New York, and will cost, when completed, in tlie neighbor hood of .§100.000. It i-s very elab orately finished inside in liarrl woods. The house contains nine bath-rooms. Every bed-room has its own bath room. Senator Palmer is a very rich man and can well afford to build such a house. He has always said that, hj! was not anxious to remain in public life, but the building of this very I much as if he expected to remain ill I Washington.

He appeared to ho in good health up to tlio moment of death, lie had held confcronccu with variouH people and at tho time Was discussing railroad matters with Mr.- Garrett, president ot the Baltimore A Ohio railroad. It was while the talk turned upon the scenes of his childhood and early work contrasted with the tremendous achievement ot old age, that Mr. Garrett, sitting on the sofa facing the iiiillionalSl^bA bSMd forward in his armchair, as was Ins habit when thorough ly interested, that tho president of the Baltimore & Ohio was suddenly made aware of slight indistinctness" in Mr. vanderbilt's speech that grew into an inarticulate sound. As lie leaned over to catch his words Mr. Van derbilt pitched forward, without a word oi warning, and full heavily on the floor on his face. Mr. Uarrett, springing to his feet with au exclamation of alarm, seized the pillow on the sofa laid it under his friend's head. He thou summoned Mrs. Vaudei' lult and (ieorge, the youngest *011.

Mr. Van derbilt, while he had, tor the past two years, been a victim more or less of indi gestion, with its attendant ills and kindred disorders, had lately, despite the frequent reports of his death, been apparently ineml ing. Mr. Vanderbilt had made a will, what its provisions are is not known to any one outsid the family and his conlidential counsel and friend, Mr. I)epew. But the Vauderbilts were a very united tumily. Mr. Depcw ventured the prediction tlint- the millionaire's death would make no change ill existing conditions. The Vanderbilt rail road systems will be managed und owned as heretofore. The sons will manage the es tatcand the property, allot which are here, th same as if the master linnd was still at the helm. Mr.Vanderbilt was, it is thought, richer than any single member of tlie Rothschild family. The duke of Westminster is said to be worth §2,000,OUO, but Yr.

Before Mr. Garrett could lean over him and place his hand upon his heart it had ceased to beat,. Within thirty seconds from the time that the indistinct articula latum was noticed lie was dead. A blood vessel in his bruin had broken, known as apoplexy. He never knew how he died or guessed that tho end of his li'fe had come.

It is claimed that millions of dollars annually are saved to shipping interests of the Atlantic ports by means of the warnings displayed by the signal service several hours in ad vance of these storms. A cold wave is an immense river of air flowing from tho Arctic regions southward through lSrilish America, and entering the ](lor eyes, found her a "A sweet voico and a sweet face, said some one beside mo.

I thought aga what strange look ing man ho was. Miss Verinder lin shed her son^ and turned round with all the pretty light on her face. He crossed over then and thanked her, whilo tho young man looked rather superciliously at hm. "I felt sure you had a singing face," he said. "Are you well oil'for music hero?" "Not vorv," she told hiin, and then slio asked if he played. "Yes," he said "it is almost the only solace I have." Ilo paused a 1 ,i,' „i,, ... n, in- 1 ought to be a kind of compensation to seo the sweet tenderness of tho bright younr face, to hear tho soft pity of her voice. Ho said something—1 did not catch what it was—and then sat down to tho piano. Play! I should think ho did play. Never had there been such music brought out of our piano. A great hush fell upon the room. Even those who did not care for music for its own sake were silent from astonishment. As for Mr. Gorst himself, the music seemed to transform him He shook back his hair, aud his grave plain face brightened up. "Jack," sitting at his feet kept his eyes steadily fixed upon him, as if he understood it all and as for Miss Ve rinder, I he pretty color grow brighter in her cheeks, and her eyes shone. She was passionately fond of music, "Odd mail! Don't you think so? very," whispered Mrs. Colquhouu— the greatest gossip in tho house -to me. "Not a gentleman, decidedly actor. I should think: professional, certainly. Dreadful flirt that girl is, to be sure. Do you admire her? No, Biirely not." 1 held up my hand to silence her, 1 did not like Mrs. Colquhouu. 1 knew her mischief-making tongue of old, and I had caught a flash from Alice Verinder's soit eyes. Mr. Gorst was going to sing for us. As he played the first bars of The Message, Jack gave a kind of strangled howl. "He is wonderfully fond of s'ng ing ng," his master explained with pride. Clearly I thought he was a thorough old bachelor, and his dog was wife and child to him. Well, I have heard many line I voices, but never one. I th nk, like I tlr. Gorst's. As the passionate. Leautifnl words of ••Tho Message" rang out. 1 felt my very heart stirred within mo. A great hush fell upen the room as he finished. One could well believe suck a voice would "pass through the golden gate." I saw a strange moved expression on Mr. Hardyngo's face, the quiet old bachelor I have men tioned before and as for Miss Ver inder, 1 did not like to look at her I knew that there wero tears in her bright young eyes. And after "The Message" he gave us "For Ever and For Ever," and "Tho Distant Shore." He would have sung all night, I th nk, if the loud clang of the tea bell had ilot souuded out, bringing us all back to the world around us. He dropped his hands from the keys quite startled. "Oh! it's only tho tea boll. Aro wo expected to cat again? ltut 1 have in flicted myself upou you." "1 could listen forevor," said the girl, with that soft lovely light still on her face. I am a foolish old woman, I know but I caught myself hoping he was uot too blind to see it. "Miss Verinder, will you not lot mo get you some tea?" broke in tho Cam bridge man, Mr. Hoare, as I found out his name was. He had been watching tho changes in tho girl's face all through the singing. Well, ho was old enough to bo her father, and he was almost blind, aud was gravo and odd-looking besides, while she was tho sweetest, freshest bit of womanhood. Young even for her twenty years. And yet' somehow those two, Mr. tiorset and Alice V.er inder, wero druwu to each other from that very first night, I think. Perhaps it was Jack, porhaps it was tho music, or that child's sweet womanly heart was moved to pity tho lonely aUticled man. She was so watch. 111 of liiui at meal times, would try in her pretty way to interest him, to dnvo the shad ows troni his laco would pay li such sweet deference. He was al ways quiet, always silent and reserved. It il not seem to me that ho look much notice of what would have rais ed a young lnau to tho seventh heaven of liapp ness. I came 011 tlieiu one morniug out among the (lowers—ho walking ui and-ilowu slowly and care fully, us an almost bhnd man does, she sprnging out iu her joy ous way, gown all rallied with embroidery, a wido hat shading her sweet face, tho sunlight on tho mass of crisp hair beneath. They said "Good morn ng" to each other, and then stio spoke to the dog. lie) ween her two admirers Miss Verinder ougjit to have acquired much useful information during that sweet summer holiday. Young lloare took possession of lior at once. I heard her blithe laugh as she answerod some remark of his. They made a hand some couple, I thought sho so fair and slim, lie so lull and dark aud broad shouldered, and both with that wondcrlul light of youth on their faces. "Ho is a handsome fellow," Mr. Gorst. said and I knew he had divined my thoughts. Ho was wonderfully sharp for all his hi ndncss. I seareeiy knew how long I had been writing. It was a letter to a dear old friend of mine, aud I had for a little whilo forgotten my surroundings, when Mrs. Colquliouu's wearisomo voice forced itself 011 my attention. Sho had exhausted her newspaper, and Mrs. Vermder hav ng just coiuo in, sho had a thrilling piece of gossip to unfold to her. '•Quito shocking, Mrs. Verinder! I was so frightened 1 could nut sloop again. Mr. Gorst, you know, became down tho corridor last night perfectly drunk, stumbling over everything. He triod to burst into my room, hut fortunately I always keep the door iocked and he felt about tho room and talked to himself half the night. Quite shocking, is it not? These pro fessional sort of people are always uusteady, and being blind seem to mako it so much worse. Really, Mrs. Verinder, don't you think wo iadios ought to tako some steps to show what we think of such conduct?" Mrs. Verinder made some fochlo sound of horror. 1 was too petrified to say anyth ng. If th was a story, it was rather a worse oue than usual if it was true But what was th indignant young figure that started up from my side? 'It is uot true, mother—I am sure it is not true. Oh, it is a shame to tell such stories of anyone! Mr. Gorst is a gentleman ho would scorn to do such things. Oil, it is cruel! l'eoplo ought to spare hiui, at least!" The child looked transformed, her cheeks bla/.ing, her brown eyes spark ling. "Alice, Alice! said her.mother. "It is the injustice of it, mother— that is what I mind." Mrs. Colquhonn was straightening her spectacles and looking up at the indignant girl with a mal cious smile. 1 knew what a story sho would make of this, and though I could not but admire Alice's generous cham pionship, 1 felt sorry she could have drawn this woman's unscrupulous tougue upon her. Sho was stiil stand:ng there, with her full young figure drawn uu, am! hor scornful face, aud Mrs. Colquhoun had just opened her lips for a crush ing retort, when behold standing amongst us Mr. Gorst himself, per fectly calm and unmoved to all out ward appoarance. Had a thunderbolt fallen amongst us we could not liuvo looked more as tonished. Mrs. Colquliouu's faco Hushed crimson, as well it mi^lu.

A Wild Animal Which Sporting Men Will Pit Against a Dog. Behind "Sport" Hayes' bar, iu hi! saloon at the western eud of the Cul lowhill street bridge, was a small cage last night. Tho many patrons of the bar eyed tho cage curiously.and asked tho bluir proprietor "what ho had in the coop." His laconic answer was "Wild-cat." "What aro you going to do with it?" was asked. "It don't belong to mo. but they aro talking of making a mutch between tho cat aud a bull dog," was the reply. Tho ru mor that the cat was to bo pitied aga nst a dog yesterday afternoon 01 evening attracted quito a crowd ol sporting men to tho old mansion that is now occupied as a saloon and res taurant by "Sport Hayes. Early iu the afternoon it was rumored that the light was to take place, but those whe came to witness it were given "tips" by the loungers about tho place that the dog was not forthcoming, and that if the light camo oil'at all it would be in tho evening. In the evening Mr. Haves said that no light iiad been contemplated and de clared that I10 would permit no liglit ug in his placo un lor any circumstan ces. It was said that the cat had been purchased by a Mr Foley for $5 and that it would be pitted against a dog iu a suburban town within a short time. The animal iu the cage was a beautiful spocimen of Ihe wild cat. It measured fully four feet from tip to lip and was as ferocious as a jungle liger. The veteran sporting men iu the bar-room talked all evening of dog fights, and all declared that they would like to seo tliu cat tackle a dog. One said that the only hope for the dog was to kill the cat at tlio first grab and that tho ouly instance in which this had buen accomplished was wlieu the dog broke the oat's back before she could limbed her deadly claws iuto his body. —Plultidelpliiu Times.

A QUAKES WIDMNtt. fks Bride In Ivory Satin, Venetian Point Laee and a Proftujhm of Diamond*. A Washington correspondent of the Louisvillo Courier-Journal writes: Thirty years ago, when Miss Bartlett, a Now York belle, sold herself to the half-breed Cuban for so many thousand dollars' worth of diamonds, the event was the sensation of the day, and was celebrated in verse as the diamond wedding. In no other way has this country made greater strides than in the possession of diamonds, and doubtless Miss Bartlett's dowry would now appear small and insignifi cant in comparison to the lavish gifts bestowed upon brides of the present day by loving relatives aud apprecia tive friends. There was a modest, unheralded wedding which took place in Albany, N. Y., on Thursday, tho 5tb, which deserves an extended no tice. Tlio bride. Miss Jeanuie Mou teith-Wilson Lathrop, daughter of the late Daniel Lathrop, of Albany, was' married to Col. George P. Lawton, of Troy. Although the wedding took plnee in tho Presbyterian Church, and the service was conducted by a Presbyterian clergyman, yet the cere mony was that of tho Quaker. Th« Rev. Charles Wood comes of a Quakei family, and Col. Lawton is also ol Quaker decent. He aud Miss Lathrop requested thoir pastor to uso the re gular Quaker formula. The church was tilled with the elite of Aibauy and Trov. Tho wedd.ng gown was oi ivory sat.u, garnished with old Veuo tian poiut lace, and tlio flowers used were Scotch heather and apple blos soms. A long, graceful traiu of white plush and "moiro" flowed over the satin, and that was trimmnd with Venetian poiut and orange blossoms. The veil was fastenoil with three dia mond stars of great splendor, and hei necklace of solila res had s.xty-six diamonds varying in size from three carats to one-half carat. Her ear riuifH wero diamonds, each stone weighing len carats. She wore three bracelets, each ouu consisting of seven large diamonds, and tho bouquet de corsage was fastened with a crescent and star of seveuteen diamonds. The bride carried a bouquet of white rose buds, orange blossoms and maiden, hair funis. Her fan was of duches« aud poiut lace. She presented a lovo ly vision of youthful beauty set in diamonds. She loolte I radiant a: sho our|it to have iooked, for tlu husband whom she luut at tho altel is iu every way worthy and su table. He is a lawyer of ability, and comes of good old Rhode Island stock. 11« is counected with Geu. Lawton, ol Savannah, Ga. THE

Tho diamond st.irs were from her sister, Mrs. Lath rop, who makes her liomu in California wilh her uncle aud aunt. The ear rings were a gift from her mother, Mrs. Lathrop, and the cro ceut from Mr. Lawton, the father of the groom. The groom's gift was a deed lo a handsome house set in the midst oi a lino park, aud this is to ho tlieii home. It will bo tilled with tho cost ly wedding proscms. for tlioy wero numerous, including entire sets of silver, pictures, cullory, richly em broidered portieres, aud hangiugs ot tlio walls, atit'quo v.ises, bronzes, a French plate bronzo mirror, and the groom, iu addition to other preseuts, gave a blue diamond r.ng. and anoth er th one largo d.amond with 1 sapphire ou either side.

They loft this morn ing for a Southern trip, which wil! take in Richmond, Charleston, Florida, and from there to Cuba, and back t« Savannah aud all the Southern cities, und perhaps a trip to tlio City of Mex ico. Col. Lawton has never been South before, aud meets with surprises at every step Tho most astonishing revelation he says is to find out that all the nogroes he has met thus far aro Democrats. Living as he always has the North, "he believed the race wero Republicans, and all reports tc to tlio contrary wero thou-111 to be inspired by bulldozers WHO held the negroes iu the bondage of fear.

It will bo remembered that the Queen at one time was in Paris in such needy circumstauces that she had to sell her jewels and other valua bles. Governor Stauford bought the four complete sets at that time. Each set has arras, necklaces, brooches, ear-rings, bracelets, and other orna ments. One set la called blue, because the rays which are emitted aro of a violet hue. Tlieso aro the rarest of all diamonds.
