WASHINGTON. Dec. .14.Senat6r Forakcr- today Introduced an amend ment to the bill providing for the re- enllstraent of negro troops discharged "without honor" because -of alleged participation In the affray at Browna- jjnne, and addressed the 'senate com KaItee concerning the amendment. X&c proposed In his new' measure to establish a tribunal consisting of re tired army officers, before" whom .evidence- may bo submitted., as to tho guilt of the defendants.'5 "and before whom the "defendants themselves might appear to. aasw'er-taarges. The measure is so drawri-as to practically take It out of the hands of the execu tive, and to give to a tribunal appoint ed .by congress, fall 'authority to con sider Brownsville questions and .by its findings provide for re-enlistment of discharged negroes.. In addressing" the senate Senator Foraker said, that during the summer letters had, been coming to lilm. from these discharged negro soldiers de claring detectives -were constantly en gaging them in conversation. The senator spoke of the activity of tht detectives as outlined by bis corre sponucate, saying. In many cases they -went bo far as to take up their dwell ing with discharged sollders for tho purpose of securing their confidence and spying upon their, movements. 1 He approved ferreting out -facts., but declared that, there waS" i vright.'way to do it.

This report enables us to fix with tolerable definiteries3 at least, some of the criminals who took the lead in the murderous shooting' ot pivato citi zens at Brownsville.

WINGS TO ACT AS BRAKE FOR A BATTLESHI! Navy Department Issues Orders For the Indiana To Be Equipped With Invention That Has Been Tested. PHILADELPHLV, Dec 14. The bat tleshlp Indlaua 's to have, wings. Re, wlugs of steel that will bo the envy 01 every other ship at the. navy yard ui League Island. Taey are to be install ed some time next month", anu whether all the ships will have them will depend upon the results of the trials. I The new wings, which, are an .u vention of a French Canadian sailor, are oddly enough, not to aid in its speed, but to retard It s Collisions be tween the warships are to be a tbuis of the past, and maneuvers in the fu ture will include not merely speed, but "short stop" exercises to teach tne sailors and officers howtto prevent be ing shot forward into tUc ocean when the brakes are put on. j The president Is interested in vut. new invention and so lS Mr. Newber ry, tho secretary' of tha navy, and ' permission Tias been granted for 'unr installation of tao "wings on the In diana. I Work has not bceunsrei, but .u. can almost -see tho- jstthit.-sldes.ut the. warship quiver with excitement at r.iu new adornment she is to receive. It is suggested that perhaps the. wings many also be used for flying purposes across inconvenient sand bars, or in case ot war, so that he. vessels iua) soar gracefully over the battlefields and discharge broadsides from tuts. sky. Tho new brake, as It is called, is made of two steel wings about four feet wide, and run from the water line down to. the keel. These wings arc no hinges and when closed lie for ward against the side of the ship. When the brake Is released the for ward motion of the .vessel opens them and the sudden motion stops the ship more effectually than any reverse en gine. The brake Is- closed and worked by hydraulic power. Its installation on the Anrerlcan war vessels was freely discussed this morn ing ai inc navy -vnru. in me cum mandant's office it was said that should It he successful. It will o-r ind for all do awav with tho many ac cidents that occur in naval battles or maneuvers. "It will mean," said one offlcsr, "t'lat Tjerc will be no more running down vestels In the fos, no more crashing of i;liips upon the rocks. It would havp saved the Yankee, when she went ashore on the Hen and Chicken iwkk. It would have saved many a vessel rem going aground, lla worth will bo far greater than Its cost If we llnd It a ruccess." - It has already beu proved valuable. It is said. In Canada, where iu invent fr row resides, btt whether Its i practicable, and -h3tker Its welgr.t will materially interfere with tne speed of the ship "has not as yet been decided. Captain Collins, of the Ind'ana,said this morning: "Yes, It is quite true that permission has been granted to install the new brake on tho Indiana. I hear that it has proved quite suc cessful in Canada and while it wiu take some time to install It the first trials will probably be made some time In January." Tlie executive officer aboard the In diana also spoke of the new brake as of probablo value to the navy "It's not a riew thing," he said, "and naval people have talked of It for somo time. We watched tho results of the trials In Canada, and "were tremen orausly pleased when we heard 'that it was to be installed here." o

Captain Wheeler secured some slight circumstantial evidence against Davalatnlos sufficient to arrest 'Aba. when ho happed to cross the line at Naco on tho night of December C. To obtain a confession or secure more tangible evidence. Cantaln Wheeler handcuffed the suspect and red him to. tho scene of the murder. It was a bright moonlight night and when they arrived within a few yards ot the scene of Urfl foul murder Dava landos broke and run. It turns out that he was a professional Greek foot- racer, and Wheeler was soon outdis tanced. "There was only one way that I could havo stopped him." said Wheeler, "and that would haTCt been to have k'lled him. That I would not do, -and the cvldenco' at that time was not certain. ,.
