Containing Szesi3.ez3.oys I&gesss in SulII- RIESSAGE. President Harrison's Annual Com munication to Congress. The LIcKinley Tariff Act Defended By the Executive. Tims Needed to Develop Its Ad vantages and Benefits. A Strong Endorsement of the Fed eral Elections Bill. The President Deeply in Earnest on This Point. The Work of the Departments Carefully Summarized. The President Message. To the Senate and House of Itepresenta tives: The reports of the several executive departments, -which will be laid before the congress in the usual course will ex hibit in detail the operation of the gov ernment for the last fiscal year. Only the more important incidents and results and chiefly such as may be the foundation of recommendations shall I submit in this annual message. The vast and increasing business of the government has been transacted by the several departments during the year with faithfulness, energy and success. The rev enues amounting to above four hundred and fifty million dollars have been col lected and disbursed without revealing bo far as I can ascertain a single case of defalcation or embezzlement. An earn est effort has been made to stimu late a 6ense of responsibility and public duty in all officers and employes of every grade and the work done by them has almost wholly escaped unfavor able criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because- the credit of this good work is not mine but is shared by the heads of the several departments with the great body of faithful oCicers and employes who serve under them. The closest scrutiny of congress is invited to all the methods of administration and to every item of expenditure. The friendly relations of our country with the nations SfiSE0 n 0t easi Lave been un- uioeu while the ties of good will and common interest that binds us to the states of the western hemisphere have been notably strengthened by the con ference held in this capital to consider measures for the general welfare. , Vlie T"an American Congress. Pursuant to the invitation authorized by congress, the representatives of every independent Btate of the American conti nent and of Hayti met in conference in this capital in October, 1889, and contin ued in session until the 18th of last April. This important convocation marks a most interesting and influential epoch in the history of the western hemisphere. It is noteworthy that Brazil was invited, while under imperial form of government, and shared as a republic in the deliberations find results of the conference. The rec ommendations of this conference were all transmitted to congress at the last session. The international marine con ference which sat at Washington last year reached a very gratifying result. The regulations suggested have been brought to the attention of all govern ments represented, and their general adoption is confidently expected. The legislation of congress at the last session is in conformity with the propo sitions of the conference and the procla mation therein provided for will be is sued when the other powers have given notice of their adhesion. General Foreign Affairs." The conference of Brussels to devise means for suppressing the slave trade in Africa afford ed an opportunity for a new expres sion of the interest the American peo ple feel in that great work. It Boon be came evident that the measure proposed would tax the resources of the Congo basin beyond the- revenues avail able under the ereneral act of Berlin of 1884. The United States not being a party to that act, could not share in its revision, but by a separate act the independent 6tate of the Congo was freed from the re striction upon a customs revenue. The demoralization and destructive traffic in ardent spirits among the tribes also claimed the earnest attention of the con ference and the delegates of the United States were foremost in advocating meas ures for its repression. An accord was reached, the influence of which will be very helpful. As soon as these measures shall receive the sanction of the Nether lands for a time withheld, the general acts will be submitted for ratification by the senate; meanwhile negotiations have been opened for a new and complete treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation be tween the United States and the indepen dent state of Congo. THE 

LAST AMERICAN MONARCHY. Toward the end of the past year, the only independent monarchical government on the western continent, that' of Brazil, ceased to exist and was succeeded by a re public. Diplomatic relations were at once established with the new govern ment, but it was not completely recog nized until an opportunity had been af forded to ascertain that it had popular approval and support. When the course of events, had yielded assurance of this fact, no tiiiie vas lost In extending the new government a full and cordial wel come into the family of American com monwealths. It is confidently believed that the good relations of the two coun tries will be preserved, and the future will witness an increased intimacy of in tercourse, and an expansion of their mu tual relations. The peace of Central America has again been disturbed through a revolutionary change in Salva dor which was not recognized by other Slates and Lootinue d- broke out btiweeu Salvador aud Guatemala threatening to involve " all Cen tral America ia conflict and undo the progress "a li Icil hzJ lissz) I toward a union of their interests. The efforts of this government were promptly and zealously exercised to compose their differences and through the active efforts of the representative of the United States a national treaty of peace was signed August 26, whereby the right of the re public of Salvador to choose its own rulers was recognized. General Ezeta, the chief of the provisional government has since been confirmed in the presi dency by the assembly and diplomatic recognition duly followed. THE KILLING OF GEN. BARRUXDIA, on board the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco, while anchored in transit in the port of San Jose de Guatemala, de manded careful inquiry. Having failed in a revolutionary attempt to invade Gua temala from Mexican territory, Gen. Bar rundia took passage at Acapulco for Panama. The consent of the representa tives of the United States was sought to effect his seizure, first at Champico. where the steamer touched, and after wards at San Jose. The captain of the steamer refused to give up his passenger without a written order from the United States minister; the latter furnished the desired letter, stipulating as the condition of his action, that General Barrundia's life should be spared and that he should be tried only for offenses growing out of his insurrectionary movements. This let ter was produced to the captain of the Acapulco by the military commander at San Jose as his warrant to take the pas senger from the steamer. General Bar rundia resisted capture aud was killed. It being evident that the minister, Mr. Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his authority in intervening in compliance with the demands of the Guatemalan authorities to authorize and effect, in vio lation of precedent, the fieizure of a vessel of the United States of a passenger in transit, charged with political offenses. In order that he might be held for such offenses under what was described as martial law, I was constrain ed to disavow Mr. ilizner's act and recall him from his post. OTHER FOREIGN AFFAIRS. The Nicaragua Canal project, under the control of our citizens is making most encouraging progress. All the prelimi nary predictions and initial operations having been accomplished within the pre scribed time. During the past year negotiations have "been renewed for the settlement of the claims of American citizens against the government of Chili, principally growing out of the late war with Peru. Reports from our minister at Santiago warrant the expectation of an early and OCR RELATIONS WITH CHINA, which have for several years occupied so important a place in our diplomatic his tory, have called for careful considera tion and have been the subject of much correspondence. The commnnications of the Chinese minister have brought into view the whole subject of our conven tional relations with his country; and at the same time this government, through its legation at Pekin, has sought to ar range various matters and complaints touching the interests and protection of our citizens in China. In pursuance of the concurrent resolution of Octo ber 1, 1990, 1 have proposed to the govern ments of Mexico and Great Britain to con sider a conventional regulatfqa of Chinese laborers across southern and northern frontiers. On the 22d day of August last, Sir Edmund Monson, the ar bitrator selected under the treaty of De cember 6th. 1883, rendered an award to the effect that no compensation was due from the DaniEh govern treat to the United States on account of what is com monly known as the Carlos Butterfield claim. OCR RELATIONS WITH THE FRENCH "republic continue to be cordial. Our representative at that court has very diligently urged the removal of the re strictions imposed upon our meat pro ducts and it is believed that substantial progress has been made towards a just settlement. The Samoan treaty signed last year at Berlin by the representatives of the United States, Germany and Great Britain, after -due ratification and ex change has begun to produce salutary ef fects. The formation of the government agreed upon will soon replace the disor der of the past by a stable administration, alike just to the natives and equitable to the three powers, most interested in trade and intercourse with the Samoan islands. The chief justice has been chosen by the king of Sweden and Norway on the invitation of the three powers and will 60on be. in stalled. The land commission and ' the municipal council are in process of or ganization. A rational and evenly distributed scheme of taxation both municipal and upon imports is in operation. Malietca is respected as king. GREAT BRITAIN. The new treaty of extradition with Great Britain after due ratification was proclaimed on the 23th of last March. Its beneficial working ia already appar ent. The difference between the two governments touching the fur seal ques tion in the Behring sea is not yet adjusted as will be seen by the correspondence which will soon be laid before congress. The offer to submit the question to arbitration as pro posed by her majesty's government, has not been accepted for the reason the form of submission proposed is not thought to be calculated to assure a conclusion satis factory to either party. It is . sincerely hoped that before the opening of another sealing season 6ome arrangement may be effected which will assure to the United States a property right, derived from Russia, which was not disregarded by say r ation for moj than Siilty years preceding the outbreak of existing trouble. In the tariff act a wrong was done to the Kingdom of Hawaii, which I am bound to presume was wholly uninten tional. Duties were levied on certain commodities which were included in the reciprocity treaty now existing between, the United States and the Kingdom ot llawaii. "Without indicating the neces sary exception in favor of that kingdom. I hope congress will repair what might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith on the part of this government. An award in favor of the United States in the matter of the claim of Mr. Vac Bokkel against Hayti t:a.s rendered on the 4th of December. iSSd. but owinz to j diso'.is.w - then and afterwards pre vailing in Hayti the term of pay ments were not observed. A new agree ment as to the time of payment has been approved and is now in force. Other just claims of citizens of the United States for redress of wrongs suffered during the late political contest in Hayti, it is hoped, will speedily yield a friendly treatment. THE TREATY WITH ITALY. Propositions for the amendment of the treaty of extradition between the United States and Italy are now under considera tion. You will be asked to provide the means of accepting the invitation of the Italian government to take part in an approach ing conference to consider the adoption of a universal prime meridian from which to reckon longitude and time. As this proposal follows in the track of the re form sought to be initiated by the merid ian conference of Washington held on the invitation of this government, the United States should manifest a friendly interest in-the initial proposal In this connection I may refer with ap proval to the suggestion of my predeces sors, that standing provisions be made for accepting, whenever deemed advisable, the frequent invitations of foreign gov ernments to share in conferences looking to the advancement of international re form in regard to science, sanitation com mercial laws and procedure and other matters affecting the intercourse and pro gress of modern communities. In the summer of 1889 an incident occurred which for some time threatened to inter rupt the cordiality of our relations, with the government oi Portugal. That government seized the Delagoa Bay railway, which was constructed un der a concession granted to an American artisan, and at the same time annulled the charter. The concessionary who had embarked his fort une in the enterprise, having exhausted other means of redress, was compelled to invoke the protection of hiB government. Our representations, made coincidentally with those of the British government, whose subjects were also largely interested, happily resulted in the recognition by Portugal of the j propriety of submitting the claim for in demnity, growing out or its action, to arbitration. This plan of settlement having been agreed upon, the interested powers read ily concurred in the proposal to submit the case to the judgment ol three eminent jurists, to be designated by the president of the Swiss republic; who, upon the joint invitation of the governments of the United States, Great Britain and Portugal, has selected per sons qualified for the task before them. 

JAPANESE TREATY RELATIONS. The revision of our treaty relations with the empire of Japan has continued to be the subject of consideration and of correspondence. The questions involved are both grave and delicate and while it will be my duty to see that the interests of the United States are not by any changes exposed to undue discrimination, I sincerely hope that such revision as will satisfy the legislative expectations of the Japanese government and maintain the present long existing friendly rela tions between Japan and the United States will be effected. 

MEXICO. The friendship between our country and Mexico, born of close neighborhood and strengthened by many considerations of intimate intercourse and reciprocity, have never been more conspicuous than now, nor more nGp?ful of increased ben efit to both nations. The intercourse of the two countries by rail, already great, is making constant growth. The established lines and those recently projected add to the intimacy of traffic and open new channels of access to fresh areas of demand and supply. The importance of the Mexican rail way system will be further enhanced to a degree almost impossible to forecast if it should become a link in the projected inter-continental railway. I recommend that our mission in the City of Mexico be raised to the first class. SPAIN. The cordial character of our relations with Spain warrants the hope that by the continuance of methods of friendly nego tiation much may be accomplished in the direction of an adjustment of pending questions and of the increase of trade. The extent and development of our trade with the Island of Cuba invest the commercial relations of the United States and Spain with a peculiar importance. It is not doubted that a special ar rangement in regard to commerce based upon the reciprocity provision e-f the re cent tariff act would operate moat ben eficially for both govetnments. XLi -subject is now receiving attention. JOHN ERICSSON. - The restoration of the remains of John Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratifying occasion to honor the great inventor, to whose genius our country owes so much and to bear witness to the unbroken friendship which has lasted between the land which bore him and our own, which claimed him as a citizen. THE YENEZCELA CLAIMS. On the second of September last the commission appointed to revise the pro ceedings of the commission under the claim convention between the United States and Venezuela of 1SGG brcught its labors to a close within the period fixed for that purpose. The proceedings of the late commission were characterized by a spirit of impar tiality and a high sense of justice and an incident which was for many years the subject of discussion between the two trovernments has been disposed of in a I r"?"er a,' honorable and saclory ! to both nartiea. ' " For the settlement of the claim of the Venezuela Steam Transportation cota pany, which was the subject of a joint resolution adopted at the last session of congress, negotiations are still in pro gress and their early conclusion ia antici pated. The legislation of the past few years has evinced on the part of congress a growmc realization of the importance of the Consular service- in fostering our commercial relations abroad and in pro tecting the domestic revenues. As the scope of operations expands increased provision must be made to keep up the essential standard of efficiency. . The necessity of some adequate measure of supervision and inspection has been so often presented, that I need only com- mena tne EUDjeci io your auenuun. financial. The revenues of the government from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 1, 1S00, were $ 4G3,963,0S0.55, and the total expenditures for the same pe riod were $356,618,534152. The surplus for the year, including the amount applied to the sinking fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts for 1890 were $16,080,923.79, and the expenditures $15,739,871 in excess of those of 1889. The custom receipts increased $5,835, 842.88, and the receipts for internal rev enue $11,725,191.89, while on the side of expenditures, that of pensions was $19, 312,075.96 in excess of the preceding year. The treasury statement for the current fiscal year partly actual and partly esti mated is as follows: Receipts from all sources $406,000,000; total expenditures $354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,000,000, not taking the postal receipts into account on eithei side. The loss of revenue from customs for the last quarter is estimated at $25, 000,000, but from this is deducted . gain of about $16,000,000 realized during the first four months of the year. . - For the year 1892 the total estimated receipts are $373,000,000, and the estimat ed expenditures $337,S52,209.42, leaving an estimated surplus of $15,147,090.58: which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000 at the beginning of the year will give $67,147,790.58 as the sum available for the redemption of outstanding bonds or other uses. The estimates of receipts for the post office department being equal, are not in cluded in this statement on either side. THE SILVER COINAGE ACT. The act "Directing the purchase of silver bullion and the issue of treasury notes thereon," approved June 14, 1890, has been administered by the secretary of the treasury with an earnest purpose to get into circulation at the earliest possible date the full monthly amounts of treasury notes contemplated ty its provisions and at the same time to give to the market for silver bullion such support as the law contemplates. The recent depreciation in the price of silver ha3 been observed with regret. The rapid rise in price which anticipa ted and followed the passage of the act, was influenced in some degree by specu lation and the recent reaction is in part the result of the same cause and in part of the recent monetary disturbances. Some months of further trial will be necessary to determine the permanent ef fect of the recent legislation upon silver values, but it is gratifying to know that the increase secured by the act hasex erted and vill continue to exert a more beneficial influence upon business and upon general values. BI-M ETALLISif While it ha3 not been thought best to renew formally the suggestion of an in ternational conference looking to an. agreement touching the full use of silver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care has been taken to observe closely any change in the situation abroad and no favorable opportunity will be lost to promote a re sult which it confidently believed would confer very large benefits upon, the com merce of tlie world. The recent monetary disturbances in England are not likely to suggest a re examinatioa of opinions upon this sub ject, - bur very large supply of gold will, if hot depleted by impulsive legislation in the supposed interest of silver, will give us a portion of advantage in promoting a permanent and safe international agree ment for the free use of 6ilver as a coin metal. INCREASING crRCCLATION. The efforts of the secretary to increase the volume of money in circulation by keeping down the treasury surplus tc the lowest practicable limit have beet unremitting and in a very high degree successful. Tables presented by him showing the increase of money in circulation during the last two decades and especially the table showing the increase during the nineteen months he has administered the affairs of the department are inter esting and instructive. The increase of money In - circulation during the nineteen months has been in the aggregate $93,866,813, or about $1 5C per capita, and of this increase only $7, 100,000 was due to the recent silver legis lation. That this substantial and needed aid gi en to commerce resu ted in an enoo mous reduction of the public debt and of the annual interest charge is matter of increased satisfaction. There has been purchased and re deemed since Jlarch 4, 1889, 4 and 4J per cent, bonds to the amount of $211, 852,450 at a cost of $246,620,741, resulting in the reduction of the annual interest charge of $8,967,609 and a total saving of interest of $51,576,706. I notice wiih great pleasure the state ment of the secretary that the receipts from internal revenue have increased during the last fiscal year nearly $12,000, 000 and that the cost of collecting this larger revenue wa3 less by $90,617 than for the same purpose in the preceding year. The percentage of cost of collecting tho customs revenue, was less for the last fiscal year than ever before. CCSTOMS ADMINISTRATION. The customs administration board pro vided for by the act of June 10, 1890, wa3 selected with great care, and composed in part of men whose previous , experience in the administration of the old customs regulations had made them familiar witb the evil- remedied ia part of men whose legal and judicial acquire ments and experience seemed to nt ICem for the work of interpreting and applying' the new statute, N- The chief' aim of 'ta.taS? is to secure honest valuations of ttll dutiable mer-. chandise and to, make these valu iions uniform at all ports of entry. It had been, manifest . by.a congres sional investigation that a , ey&tom of un dervaluation has been long in use by certain classes of importers, resulting not only in a great loss of revenue, but in a - most intolerable discrimination. It is not seen how the legislation can now be re garded by the citizens of any country having commercial dealings with ua as unfriendly. If any duty is supposed to be excessive let the complaint be. lodged there. It will surely not be claimed by any well disposed people that a remedy may be sought and allowed in a system of quasi-smuggling. the W.r Department. v The report of the secretary of war shows several gratifying results attained during the year by wise and unostenta tions methods. The percentage of deser tions from the army (for which both con gress and. the department have been long seeking a remedy) has'been reduced dur ing the past year 24 per Cent and for the months of August and September, during which time the favorable effects of the act of June 16, were only 33 per cent as compared with the same months of 1889. The results attained by a reorganiza tion and consolidation of the divisions having charge of the hospital and ser vice records of the volunteer soldiers are very remarkable. This change was effected in July, 18S9, and at that time there were 40,654 cases awaiting atten tion, more than half of these being calls from the pension claims. On the 30th of June last, though over three hundred thousand new calls had come in. there was not a single case that had not been examined and answered. COAST DEFENSES. I concur in the recommendations of the iecretary that ade uate and regular ap propriations be continued for coast de fense works and ordnance. Plans have been practically agreed upon and there can be no good reason for delaying the execution of them, while the defenseless state of our great sea ports furnishes an urgent reason for wise expedition. The assistance that has been extended to the militia of the states generally and most appropriately designated the "Na tional Guard," should be continued and enlarged. These military, organizations constitute in a large sense, the army of the United States, while about five-sixths of the annual cost of their maintenance is defrayed by" states Department of Justice. The report of the attorney-general is, under the law, submitted directly to congress, but as the department of jus tice is only one of the executive depart ments, reference to - the work done, is appropriate here. A vigorous and in the main an effective effort has been made to bring to trial and punishment all violators of the law: but at the same time, care has been taken that frivolous and technical offences should not be used to swell the fees of officers or to harass well-disposed citi zens. Special attention is called to the facts connected with the prosecution of vio lations of the election laws and of of fenses against United States officers. The number of convictions Becured, very many of them upon pleas of guilty, will, it is hoped, have a salutary restrain ing influence, - POSTMASTERS PERSECUTED. There have been several cases where postmasters appointed by me have been subjected to violent interference in the discharge of their duties and to persecu tions and personal violence of the most extreme character. Some of these cases have been dealt with through the department of justice and in some cases the postoffices have been abolished or suspended. I have directed the postmaster general to pursue this course in all cases where all other efforts fail to secure for any postmaster, not himBelf in fault, an oppor tunity peacefully to exercise the duties of his office. But such action will not supplant the efforts of the department of justice to bring the. particular offenders to punish ment. SATUfiALIzATi6& The vacation by judicial decrees of fraudulent certificates of naturalization Upon bills of equity filed by the attorney general in the circuit court of the United States is a new application of a familiar equity jurisdictiction. Nearly one hundred such decrees have been taken during the year, the evidence disclosing that a very large number of fraudulent certificates of naturalization have been issued and in this connection I beg to renew my recommendation that the laws be so amended as to re quire a more full and searching inquiry into all the facts necessary to naturaliza tion before any certificate is granted. It certainly ia not too much to require that an application for American citizen shall be heard with as much care and recorded with as much formality as are given to cases involving the pettiest property right. x POOL SELLING. At the last session I returned without my approval a bill entitled, "An act to to prohibit book-making and paol selling In the District of Columbia," and stated my objection to be that it did not pro hibit but in fact licensed what it pur ported to prohibit. An effort will be made under existing laws to suppress this evil. It is not certain that they will be found adequate. Potoffico Department. The report of the postmaster-general shows the most gratifying progress, in the important work committed to his direc tion. The business methods have been greatly improved by large economy in expenditure and an increase of four and three-quarter millions in re ceipts have been realized. The de ficiency this year is $5,788,300 as against $6,2504S3 last ytsr, notwithstanding the great enlargement i the service. Mail routes have been extended and quickened and greater accuracy aod dispatch in dis tribution and delivery have been at tained. ' The report will be found to t& full of interest and suggestion not only to con gress, but to those cUiitens who may be interested to know what business meth ods can do for that department of public administration which most nearly touches all our people. ' THE ATT-LOTTERY ACT-. The passage of the act to atiied cer tain sections of the revised tatlte re lating to lotteries, approved ptember 19, 18$0, has been received "with, great, and deserved popular iavbr. : The postofSce depart mt-nt and the. tle Ipartihent Kit justice at' c-tfee entered apon the enforcement Oftlie law with eympa- thetic Vigor, and, already the public mails Lave 'tween 'largely 'freed from tha. fraudu lent iUid demoralK':ng appeals fEnd litera ture emanating from the lottery compan ies. , The Naral Department. The construction and equipment of the new ships for the navy have made very satisfactory progress. Since March 4, 1889, nine new vessels have been put in commission, and during this winter four more, including one monitor, will be added. The construction of the other vessels authorized is being pushed, both in the government and private yards, with en ergy and watched with the most scrupu lous care. The experiments conducted during the year to test the relative resisting power of armor plates, have been so valuable as to attract great attention in Europe. The only part of the work upon tho new ships that is threatened by unusual delay is the armor plating and every effort is being made to reduce that to the minimum. It is a source of congratulation that tie anticipated influence of these modern ships upon the esprit de corps of the officers and seamen has been fully realized. Confidence and pride in the ship among the crew are equivalent to a secondary battery. Your favorable con sideration is invited to the recommenda tions of the secretary. Department of the Interior. The report of the secretary of the inte rior exhibits with great fullness and clearness the vast work-ef that great de partment and the satisfactory results at- tained. The suggestions made by him are earnestly commended to the con gress, though they cannot all be given particular mention here, INDIAN' RESERVATIONS. ' The several acts of congress looking to the reduction of the larger Indian reser vations, to the more rapid settlement of the Indians as individuals, and the resto ration to public domain of lands in excess of their needs, have been largely carried into effect so far as the worS: was con fided to the executive. Agreements have ' been concluded since March 4, 1889, involving the cession to the United States of about 14,720,000 acres of land. These contracts have, as required by law, been submitted to con gress for ratification and for the appro priations necessary to carry them into effect. These with the Sisseton and Waupeton Sac and Fox, Iowa, Pottawa tomies and absentee Shawnees and Coeur D' Alene tribes, have not yet received the sanction of congress. Attention is also called to the fact that the appropriations made, in the case of Sioux Indians have not covered all the stipulated payments. This should be promptly corrected. If an agreement is confirmed all of its terms should be com plied with without delay and full appro priations should be made. ' ' THE PCBLIC DOMAIN. "The policy outlined in my last annual message in relation to the patenting of lands to settlers upon the public domain, has been carried out in the administra-. No general suspicion nor imputation of fraud has Teen allowpd to delay the hearing and adjudication of individual: . cases upon their merits. The purpose has been to perfect the title of honest settlers with sue prompt ness, that the value 6f the entry might not be swallowed up by the expense and. extortions to which, delay subjected the claimant. . The average monthly issue of agricul tural patents has been increased about six thousand. ' " PENSIONS. The disability pension act which was approved on the 8fth of June last, has been put into" operation as rapidly as was . practicable. The increased clerical force as provided, was selected and assigned to the work and a considerable part of the fofcfc . engaged in examinations in the ifteld was recalled and added to the work ing force of the office. The examination and adjudication of claims have by reason of improved methods been more rapid than ever before. There is no economy to 'the government in delay while there Is much hardship and injustice to the sol dier. The anticpated expenditure while very large, will not, it is believed, be in excess of the estimates made before the enactment of the law. This liberal en largement of the general law should Bug' gest a more careful scrutiny of bills not only for special relief but as to the cases where relief is granted and as to the amount allowed. THE MORMONS. The increasing numbers and influence of the non-Mormon population in Utab are observed with satisfaction. The recent letter of Wilford Woodruff, president of the Mormon church, in which he advised! his people "to refrain from contracting &uj uianiagB loruiuuen Dy me laws oi the land" has attracted wide attention and it is hoped that its influence will be highly beneficial in restraining infrac tions of the law of the United States. But the fact should not be overlooked y that the doctrine or belief of the church that polygamous marriages are right -and supported by divine revelation re mains unchanged. President Woodruff does not denounce the doctrine, but refrains from touching it and advises against the practice of it because the law is against it. Now, it is quite true that the laws should not a ' tfTnnt. to rlaol -aritli tlio foitk ? any one, but it is quite another thin 1 deal with the territory of Utah, jfer those who believe polygamy to r . ht ehall not necessarily have the r ot, v ; , - OI make it lawful.
