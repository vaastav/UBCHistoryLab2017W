DEVELOPMENT OF CUBA. A Suggestion That the Civil Features of the Government of the Island be Extended—The National Expansion Question Treated Cautiously—Con gress Convenes. Washington, D. C., Dec. s.—With (lags floating in the breeze above the National Capitol, the White House and other public building?, the city filled with lawmakers from every state In the Union, and the galleries crowded with spectators, Congress opened for the session of"JO-1900. The throng of spectators, as usual was at the capitol early and the scramble for the best seats from which to watch the open ing porceedings, was fierce from the time the doors opened until the gal leries were completely filled. There was nowhere near sufficient seating, capac ity or standing room to accommodate those who wished to grace tlie occasion with their presence, and in consequence of this there were many who had to content themselves with waiting until the newspapers could tell them what had happened within the halls of (,fin gress on the opening day. out <>t' respect to the memory of the late Vice President Hobart the pro ceedings in both the House and Senate were made as brief as possible and after the swearing in of members and the allotment of seats an adjournment was taken until Tuesday. The drawing for seats in the House was attended with all its usual amusing features. The elite of the city and the nation were witnesses to the bits of pleasantry Indulged in on the floor of the House, and many of the incidents were of such a humorous character that there was an almost continuous uproar of laugh ter during the two hours this pleasing feature of the "performance" was on. What the President Recommends. Now York, Dec. 3.—A special from Washington to the New York World says: Washington, Dec. s.—une of the most important features of the third annual message which President Mc- Kinley will send to Congress is the finances of the country. The sugges tions of the President are distinctly In favor of a single standard. Gold will be the keynote of the Administra tion's plans for governmental pprposts. "The St. Louis platform of '96 is prac tically ignored and the most emphatic language is employed to make manifest the purposes of the President to stand unquestionably for currency reform up on a single standard. The construction of this part of the President's message has received more attention than .ill the other features combined. "In dealing with national expansion the President exercises extreme cau tion, contenting himself with a his torical narrative of the operations of the Government in attempting to re construct the governments of Cuba. Porto Pico, the Philippines, Hawaii and Guam. No reference is made to the treaty which the President has made with the Sultan of Sulu. "No recommendations are made con cerning the sort of government to be eventually established in the Philip pines. and no reference is made to the existence of the so-called Filipino gov ernment. "Regarding Cuba the President con tines his recommendations to a further development of the government estab lished there, suggesting an extension of the civil features of it which have al ready been experimented on. The President will say that the condition of the people of the Islands Is vastly bett >r than it was before the advent of the I'nited States. "Porto Pico, he says, should have a Territorial form of government similar to that enjoyed by Arizona, New Mex ico and Alaska. The people of the isl and. while not capable of self-govern ment, he says, ar* entitled to repre sentatives in Congress and such bene fits as may accrue from a Territorial form of government. The President will also suggest that more moderate tariff regulations V • provided for Cuba and Porto Rleo. T! further declares in favor of laws designed to encourage the people of those Islands to advanced in dustry. the free admission of agricul tural Implements and other articles necessary to deveb-n their resouves. "Hawaii the President points to in his message as an example of what other colonies may become under favorable conditions. He suggests a liberal Ter ritorial form of government for the Pacific territory. Guam and the new Samoan Island which the United States has Inherited do not come In for any portk ular attention at the hands of the President, ho believing that they are both properly conducted. "The most important of his reflections on the attitude of this Government to w*n*d others relates to the nrltish-Fioer troubles. He expresses his profound regret at the existence of this trouble, but skilfully avoids any comment that may b<- construed to reflect upon.either Government. "The President urges Congress to en .'it the Hanna-Payne shipping bill, which proposes a subsidy to vessels rallying American registry. He also suggests the necessity for the comple tion <>r the isthmian ennal as soon as possible " C=5S Advises on Financial Bill. Washington. Dee. ".—The Republican members af the Senate Committee on finance met Saturday afternoon to consider a financial bill. Senators Aid rich. Allison. Piatt of Connecticut. Wolcott and liurrows were present. Mr. Piatt, of New York, being the only ab sentee. Secretary Gage ■ ent over the gen eral situation with heiommittee, mak ing various reconir endations as to the details of the measure to be introduced. One of the points discussed was the advisability of a general refunding of the bonded debt of the country at a lower rate of interest than now pre vailing. The indications are that i feature of this kind v 111 li« incorporat ed ill the Senate bill. It can be definite';* stated that the Senate measure will make provision for the maintenance of the gold stand ard. It is also quite definitely under stood that the Senate bill will b- an entirely different measure from that prepared by the House Republican Caucus Committee, in phraseology and detail, and cover some points not in cluded in that measure. Henderson Named By Acclamation. Washington, Dec. 5.- The caucus of the Republican members of the House was brief. The selection of a candidate for Speaker by the party in power usu ally is an animated affair, but months ago all the other candidates who en tared the field after the retirement of Speaker Reed abandoned the contest, leaving Colonel David I:. Henderson of lowa the unopposed candidate. His nomination therefore was a forcgi ne conclusion, and he was named by ac clamation. It also was decided, with out a dissenting voice, to re-enact th" rules laid down bv former Speaker Heed. The' Officers of the last House, except Colonel Russell. the Sergeant-at-Arms. were renominated without opposition, as follows: <'lerk, Alexander McDow ell of Pennsylvania; Doorkeeper. W. ,1. Glenn of New York: Postmaster. .1. C. Mcßlroy of Ohio, and Chaplain, the 1 lev Henry Cnnden of Michigan. Democrats Select Richardson. Washington. Dec. j.—The Democrats of the House of Representative- at their caucus, held in the hall of Repre sentatives, selected Representative J. D. Richardson of Tennessee as their candidate for Speaker after a spirited contest which lasted through six bal lots. This carries with it tie* Demo cratic leadership on the floor. Mr. Richardson has served fourteen years in the House, and is tin- oldest Demo cratic member in point of service ix- Cept .Mr. Mcllae of AI
