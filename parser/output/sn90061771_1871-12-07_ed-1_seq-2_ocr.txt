TROT, MO.. DECEMBER 7, 187f. The President's Message. , Tho President's annua! mosiage is go rail lookod for aith a dogroo of inter st and anxiety comtnonsurat with tho political status of the country f and ow ing to tho state of affairs that exists in farts of the South, tho last messago was awaited with probably moro anxiety than any other of tho present administration. We bad intendod to publish it, but it has fallen so far short of what wo antioipatod, r wbat Iho exigencies of tho times do tnanded, that wo feol we would bo intrud ing upon tho patience of our readers to reproduce it in these columns. It is one of the woakest documents that ever emo Dated from any ono occupying tho ex alted position of Chief Magistrate of tho ountry, and compared eren with Grant's former messages is decidedly tame. It appears to be mainly an indox to tho accompanying documents of tho Secreta ries, in whioh ho assumes tho rolo of tho innocent and the instructed, and of ne cessity sanctions everything contained in them. That portion of Lis meg mhioh the country awaited with so much interost, t. c, his reasons for declaring martial law in nino counties of South Carolina, is as tame as tho other portions of tho document. Upon u matter of bo much importance, ono in which the liberties of tho pooplo aro so dcoply involved and tho main features of our republican institu tions aro cudaugorcd, it was hoped that bo would devote moro attention than a rocro excuse of his enforcing so ruinous a policy ; and for tho "necossity of tho course pursued" ho refers to tho report of tho "coramittoo to investigate southern out rages." In this connection ho simply cites that among tho operations of the alleged lawless organizations, there "were frequont whippiugB and occasional assas flinations," and that such organizations failed to surrondor themselves and arms ... uuuu.uuuo io u.a proo.au.auon o. iue 13th of October. Tho outrages, for 1 1! . - t- i . r I which his proclamation was iasuod a few days after his suspending the writ of habeas corpus, according to his attorney gcnorul, wcro committed last March, and at the time it was enforced comparative peace reigned in the sections so outraged. If ho really had a dosiro to punish crimo, why wore not tho provisions of the Ku klux bill enforced at an earlier day, and why did ho wait till tho full elections were over beforo executing them ? And why were the innocent made to suffer all tho rigors of martial law booaueo of tbo nets of a few lawless men ? And why was this power, as well as that conferred by tho Federal elcotion bill, given him upon tho ove of a presidential election by an organized party that favors his re oleotion ? Grant's excoso for his actions is as shallow as it is groundless. Again, ho says that "as soon as it was ascertained tbat the authorities of the United States were about to tako vigorous mcasuros to enforco tho law, many persons absconded, and thoro is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violated tho law." This is tho reasoning of a military despot. Who is it that wouldn't flco from tho despotio injustice of martial law, if able, whon innocenco is as liable to to puuishmont an guilt? Thi wouder to us in that the South is not depopulated by the harsh means that havo been used against it. But consoious of their inno ccuco, and firm in tho hope that the peo pie will eventually triumph over the des potio rulo born of the war, tho South has bravoly stood its ground and auffored in suit, iojustico and financial ruin. God grant that there may yet to "balm in Gilead." Oao othor important featuro of tho messago is a recommondation for general amnesty. Here the President's ground; aro well taken, but even in this ho ox bibits a cowardly fear of tho pcoplo, and Us wordiug plainly shows tbat if tho dis abilities inoludod in the Fourteenth amendment embraced tho right of tho ballot, ho would besitato to reoommend amnesty. This is clearly shown in tho opening sontohoo, when bo says : "It may well be considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by tho Fourteenth amendment should be removed ; that amendment does not exclude the ballot, but enly requlros the disabil ity to hold office ef certaiu classes," As this is the redeoming featuro of tbo mos sage, wo subjoin his reasons for rccom mending it : "When the purity of the ballot is so cured, majorities are sure to oleot officers reflecting tho views of tho majority. 1 do not see the advantago or propriety of oxeluulng men trom ottico meroly because they were, before the rebellion, of stand ing und character sufficient to bo elected to positions requiring tbom to toko tho oath to support tho constitution, and ad roitting to eligibility those entertaining tho samo views, but of less standing in their communities, It may bo said tho former violated an oath, whilo tho latter did not. Tho latter did not havo it in ibi'ir power to do so. If thov had taken ibis oath, it cannot bo doubled they would II. .. ....

Thinks tho policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably. Thinks caution should bo observed in disposing of publio lands, that thov shjjuld bo regarded as a heritago to our children, but winks at tho great railroad grabs of this important "heritago," and os if afraid to vonturo far into this mat ter, recommends Congress to tho roport of tho secretary of the intorior.

Thinks that tnakinir tho Distriot of Columbia a territory was a good thing, under whioh tho citizens of Washington have voluntarily taxed thorn solves to a largo amonnt for the purpose of contributing to tho advancement of the state governmont, (but fails to say that n largo numbor of nogro votes were trans ported from neighboring states to assist in making this "voluntary taxation") ; and rocommonds "an appropratton by Congress iu order that tho government may bear its just share of tbo axpense" of making the capital a groat city. And as if ho wished to close his incssago with abugo joko, undor tho hooding of "Civil Servico," ho says, "It has boen tho aim of tho administration to onforo honesty and efficiency in all publio offices." Ho is mum on San Domingo. Tho report of Geo. S.

(Tho President, however, puts it down at $86,- 057,120.80.) Tho documont is carefully prepared, and if there wcro any errors in it, it would be simply ridiculous in us to attempt to point them out. Of course au efficient official, as Mr. Boutwoll is, can covor up from tho publio view any discrepancies, and as this report is ex peclod to havo great influenco over tbo next presidential election, of courso it has on Its "Sunday clothes," although there may bo some dirty garmonts under neath. Taking into consideration the workings of tho administration for the past year its determination to bo ro- olectod wo cannot be far wrong in sun- posing tliut the talent of tho office-holding brigado has dono its level best to make an electioneering document out of the accompanying roports of the messago. In estimating tho receipts and expendi tures for tho Gscal year ending Juno 30, 1873, ho makes tho receipts 884,073,- 22G.01 in excess of tbo expenditures. something over 50,000,000 of which is recommended for tho decrease of tho publio debt. Ho makes a number of recommendations, such as appropriations for govorment buildings, light houses, coast surveys, incrcaBo of salaries, &o. ; spoaks of our ocean cqmmerco and other matters ; dcvoteB considerable space to what is tormed tho "new loan," and says tho credit of the oountry it fully estab lished in ovory financial centre of Europe Whilo the roport is one of great interest to tho country, it is too lengthy for re production in our limited spaco. A Now York Republican politician, prominent in the anti-Grant movement, was in Washington last Tuesday, con ferring with Senator Schurz and others for tho formation of an anti Grant party, to bo composed of Republicans and Con servatives. It is not ascertained that any definite steps wero taken. The oonfer enco was morely a preliminary skirmish to see what could be dona. The Legislature of this stata convened yesterday. Nothing has been heard from it up to the time of going to press. Col.

Montgomery Blair Interviewed. A Washington special of tho 20th ult. to the Missouri Republican says : A long intorvicw with Hon. Montgomery Blair is printed hero to-day on tho presidential campaign. Mr. Blair roundly denounces Grant as an ignorant man with a strong will that compols congress to obey him in all things. "Lot tho Humoorutio part; as an organization stand hack and let the field be kept clear to tbo disaffected and independent Republicans. Tho Missouri programme suits mo ; thoro tbo Radicals wero defeated through this kind of co operation, liet the Radicals call their convention and nominate Grant, and thon let tbo independent Republicans bolt and nomiuato whoever they ploaso, and thon let the Democrats rally to his support. This is the way that Lincoln got in in 18G0, and in this way Grant oan easily bo dorcated." Reportor: Do you think tho Demo crats as a party would acquicsco in this? Mr. Blair : I beleivo they aro fast com ing up to it. I havo reason to know that it has been under consideration now for about a year, and it meets with but little opposition. I met Senator Casserly ytstorday, and he tells mo he warmlv an- proves this polioy. Senator Stockton sends me word that he approves it. 1 mot Bob Uuld to day und talked it to him, and his -i-. i .., . uyes giiaieneu at mo prospect tbat the South could be relieved from military A t 11- .

The in dependent Republicans are in favor of oivil-sorvice reform, reduotion of taxa tiou revenue, and they aro opposed to monopolies, to bartoring away our publio domain, to grasping railroad corporations, iu luiiuj; Duu9.uisB iu Bieamsuips, to giv ing power to the president to declare mar tial law in tho states, to the rapid pro gross now being mads toward centraliza tion, to corruption, to fraud and to nenot- ism, and so aro the Democrats. Exoept a few bistorio traditions tbo Democrats havo no other platform ; they aro fighting tor me same principles, hence tbo greater neeu oi suon oo-operation. Reporter: Who do you think would mako the most formidable anti-Grunt candidate ? Mr, Blair: There aro about half dozen, among which there could be no particular choice. My personal prefot enco is for William Cullen Bryant. Mr. Georgo Alfred Towntend says tbat a great ueai ot unnecessary fuss has been made about President Grant's son going to Europe. Mr. Townscnd does not seam to be aware that in ordor to send bis son to Europe President Grant has deliberately broken the law of tho land, wbioh provides that "no subaltern officer shall have any leave of absence until he shall have served at least two years with the company to which bo may bo attaohod." Tbo fact tbat a young man goes to Europe on a pleasure excur sion is of little aooount; but when tbe Prosident of the United States delibera tely breaks tho law in order to confer upon his son a special favor which no othor subaltern officer of the army would be allowed to rcceivo, the matter ceases to bo unimportant. If tho President wil fully breaks the law, who cat be required te obey it? N. Y. Suit. TlieTArlff Brought Hone.

Chicago Evening Post. The Protective Tariff, One instanco of tho working of tho protective tariff, of whioh tho Radical party is the special champion, will servo to show tho laboring classes, regardless of vocation, bow a few monopolists, shielded by partisan legislation rob the great majority of tho pooplo of tho le gitimato proceeds of thoir toil. In tho Manchester (England) Gazette appears tho following advertisement : "Whcolor U W.Iouu'b gt-UQlno silent working sowing machines, proved by 20 years' experience, and a sale of over half a million, to bo tho bost sewing machines in tho world for family uso, and general manufacturing purposes. Prices from 0 Cs. Cash or on easy terms. Prospectus froo. Onlv dnnnt 131 Market street, Manchester." Under tbe benign influenco of tho protcctivo tariff in this oountry, tho maohino that will cost an Englishman about 830 will cost an American 885 r tho difloreneo going into the hands of tuo monopolist. A great many good housewives who are unablo to own a raachino at 885, would gladly purohaso ono at 830, but they aro prevented from so doing to enrich tbo monopolist, or tbe luvorcu icw. How long tho poople of this country will continue to be swindled and op pressed in this manner, donends noon how long they voto to rotain in office the members of the party that enacts and oniorcos protective tariffs. Tbo Demo cratic party has always been the advocato of free trado, and tho cnomv of nroteo- tion. It lies with tbe pooplo thomsclves in 1872 to say how mnoh longer this state of things shall exist. The return ot a Kadical Congress fastens it upon them indefinitely the eleotion of a Ucmooratio Congress insures its immedi- ate overthrow. Ularksville Sentinel. Taxation too Heavy. Tho offer of a plantation of four hundred acres with good improvements, looated in a dcsirablo neighborhood and healthy locality, says the Marianna Courier, for tho same amount of oash which would be realized from the sale of the crop on one hundred and sixty aores whioh is now being har vested, was publicly made a few days since ny toe owner witnout any ono prof fering to aeoept the barein. Three dol lars and thirty-eight cents taxation on tbe hundred dollars worth of property is causing others to notioe the channel whence the large amount of the profits of their labor and industry flows, and to appreciate tbe extent ot their injury by tho high banded robbory now practiced upon the people in the guise of taxation. It is truly an appalling condition of affairs when plantations aro offered for what one-ball of tbe tillablo land belong ing to it will produce I But it is never tbeless a painful faot continuing to in oreas in its damaging tendency without anaiement, and will ever so continuo until the present set of dishonest scala wags and thieving carpet baggers aro displaced trom tbe position! thoy die graoe.
