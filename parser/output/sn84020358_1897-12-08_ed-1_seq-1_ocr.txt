VOL. LXV. NQ. 293. PRICE THREE CENTS. NEW HAVEN CONN., WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1897. THE CARRINGTON PUBLISHING CO. LOCAL ELECTION RESULTS VOTES SCARCE AND DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES NUMEROUS. Democrats Elect All Their Candidates for Selectmen and Constables C. II. Hamil ton Elected First Selectman Vote for Ward Officer In Annexed Districts Counters Somewhat Mixed. The town of New Haven elected Ave selectmen and five constables at the election yesterday. There was little contest for the positions and the vote was unusually light. What voters did get out to the polls seem to have voted the democratic ticket and their three candidates for selectmen and three can didates fo?" onstables were elected, re ceiving nearly 2,000 more votes than the republican nominees. The two republi can candidates receiving: the highest number of votes were also elected. Republicans seem to have forgotten that there was an election, and their candidates polled less than 2,700 votes, as against 8,000 votes a year ago. In the First ward the republican ticket polled only 96 votes-, against over 400 a year ago. In the Second ward the tick et polled 189. in the Eighth 207, in the Ninth 24 and in the Tenth 303. The ffenth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth wards were the only ones in which the republican candidates got a majority of the votes cast. In addition to voting for selectmen, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fif teenth wards each elected two aldermen (one for a short and one for a long term) and three councilmen. In these elections the honors were somewhat di vided. In the Thirteenth ward the re publicans elected the short term alder man and the three councilmen, while the democrats elected the long term al derman. The same division was also made in the Fourteenth ward, the dem ocrats taking the long term alderman only. In the Fifteenth ward the demo crats swept the deck and elected both aldermen and the three councilmen. The vote was so small that it was quickly counted, in some of the wards too quickly counted, for the returns made to Moderator Colonel Frank T. Lee were in sevetfal instances erroneous. It was the old story counters mixed up on the vote for first selectman and the ' vote for selectmen. The name occupy ing first place on the ticket is voted for first selectman. In five out of the fif teen wards the votes on first selectman "were improperly returned. The count ers in the Third and Fourth wards re turned no votes cast for first selectman, a condition of affairs which could not possibly exist. . v The Fifth ward counters did better yet and returned all the votes cast far the several candidates for selectmen VOTE OF THE TOWN , 12 3 t .

The Thir teenth ward counters introduced still another variation and returned all tlio votes as cast for first selectman, while a beautiful blank was left in the place for the return of the vote 'or selectmen. The moderator refused to accept thi3 and the return was corrected to cori-e- spond with the Fifth ward method. namely, all the votes were Improperly returned as votes for first selectman and properly returned as votes for se lectmen. The Fourteenth ward was the ward that broke the camel's back and the moderator's patience. The counters from this ward at first returned the votes as all for selectmen and no votes for first selectman. When attention was called to the error it was corrected according to the original plan of the Thirteenth ward, all the votes being returned for first selectman and none for selectmen. This latter was the way the vote was counted at first and the five candidates receiving the largest number of votes were declared elected by the moderator. By. this count Mr. Root was the sec ond selectman elected by the republi cans, while Mr. Ross, who had the least number of votes of the three republican candidates, was defeated, Mr. Root hav ing eleven votes more than Mr. Rose. If the vote in the Fourteenth ward had been returned for selectmen and count ed, instead of being left out entirely and counted only for first selectman, Mr. Rose would be elected, as he had twenty more votes than Mr. Root. Realizing the mistake, and before he had adjourned the meeting, Colonel Lee, the moderator, determined to have the error corrected. 1 He at once went in hot chase after the counters of the Four teenth ward and had them make a re turn more in accordance with the . ap parent purpose of the voters of the ward. It took some time to find the counters and for them to correct the error, so It was after 12 o'clock before the corrected returns were received. The vote of the ward was returned for se lectmen and so counted, making Mr. Rose the republican elected and Mr. Root the one defeated. The vote of the ward was not counted for first select man according to this last return. For tunately the improper return of the vote of five of the wards for first selectman could not affect the result, as Mr. Ham ilton, the democratic candidate, had a large majority. The selectmen elected yefterday only hold office until the first week day of June next, when new selectmen elected in April will take office. As the duties of the selectmen since the consolida tion of the outlying districts with the city are hardly more than nominal, and the term of office so short, the office seems hardly worth such bother as was occasioned by yesterday's election. , The counters in the Fifteenth, ward in their haste or glee failed to Yetunr any votes for Michael Doohan, one of the democratic candidates for councilman. Attention was called to the error and the return sent back for correction. Mr. Doohan received 172 votes, electing him a councilman. The vote was counted quickly, in some wards being counted an hour after the polls closed.

Boston, Dec. 7. Seventeen of the thirty-two cities of the commonwealth held their municipal elections to-day. In a majority of cases the republicans were successful in electing their mayor and securing control of the city govern ment, although the results show that the idea of independent or non-partisan control of municipalities is steadily growing in favor. Seven of the seven teen mayors chosen won upon other than straight party nominations, al though nearly all had party endorse ment. Six mayors were re-elected. On the license question the contest as usual was closely fought, but the advocates of no license lost much ground and strength. Three cities Brockton, Hav erhill and Gloucester went over into the license column, the former having been dry for a decade and the others for two and one years, respectively. DEMOCRATIC FOR FIRST TIME, Very Unusual Result in the Election at Marlboro, Mass. Marlboro Mass., Dec. 7. For the first time in its eight years of municipal life this city has elected a democrat. To day Dr. Eugene G. Hoyt defeated Fred erick A. Pope, republican, by a major ity of 293. The victory is attributed to the popularity of the democratic candi date and disaffffection in the republican ranks. Dr. Hoyt carried every ward in the city except Ward 1, which is the home of his rival. Fall River Republican. Fall River, Mass., Dec. 7. The city election brought out a very large vote due to the contest- for the offi.ee of mayor and upon the license question. Amos P. Jackson, republican, is elected over James (H. Hoar, democrat, by a small majority. The city went for li cense by 1,034 votes. The alderma-nic board elected is six republicans and three dmocrats. Th council is eighteen republicans and nine democrats. The vote for license is yeas, 6,379; no, 5,345. Died at the Foils. Fitchburg, Mass., Dee. 7. The city election to-'day was devoid of excite ment, .the chief contest being on the question of license. The city went no license for the fifth time by a vote of 2,326 to 1,869. At the polling place in ward four, Henry S. Hitchcock, a war veteran of the Twenty-first regiment, died of heart failure. The result of to day's election is the choice of Henry E. Rockwell, cit. ind., for mayor. The city council is six aldermen and seventeen councilmen, all citizens', independent. Republicans Sweep Springfield. Springfield, Mass., Dec. 7. The repub licans swept the city to-day, re-electing Mayor Hanery S. Dickinson over Col one! John L.

Haverhill. Haverhill, Mass., Dec. 7. In the elec tion to-day the republican nominee. John A.

Chase, non-partisan democrat, 3,109; John A. Gale, republican, 2,338; John C. Chase, socialist, 875. License Yes 3,468, no 2,775. f,icenso in Brockton. Brockton, Mass., Dec. 7.

Tells Story of Alleged Murder of Her Brother by linnul. Bridgeport, Dec. 7. What is generally thought will prove to be one of the most notable trials in the criminal an nals of Fairfield county opened here to day before Judge Wm. T. Elmer, of the superior court, when Charles A. Bonal was placed on trial charged with mur dering George Marcus Nichols on Dan iels' farms on the night of July 23. The court granted the motion of Attor ney Lynch for the defense that all wit nesses be excluded from the court room while they vere not testifying, allow ing the detectives, however, to remain in the room. The first witness was David Brins made of Shelton, a civil engineer, who had prepared a chart of the scene of the crime and vicinity. He was followed by Photographer Montagnani of this city, who takes all the photographs for the police, who testified to taking the thirteen pictures that were shown of the room where the murder was com mitted and other views of the locality. Miss Mary Nih5ls, a sister of the mur dered man, was the next witness. She in these dispatches heretofore. She told inthese dispatches heretofore. She told how the men ate in the house after shooting her brother and described in detail the sufferings of her brother. . Throughout her testimony Miss Nichols spoke of "he" as if It was al ways one person that took an active part in the matter. It was he that fired the shots, demanded the money and went to the cellar for the brandy, and his companion was only a passive ac complice. Miss Nichols was on the stand thirty-five minutes this after noon, and exceptin for a brief while, when she was . somewhat overcome when referring to her brother, she bore the strain very well.

Every Development Is Observed as Part of the Process by Which European Nations Are Seeking to Dismember Chinese Em pireAbsorption of the Orient by the Occident. Washington, Deo. 7. The German ad vance in China is being -watched with keen interest in official and diplomatic circles here owing to the latest cabled reports that Germany has sent an arm ed force inland and occupies the town of. Kiao Chou. While it Is said that the United States has po direct con cern in the trouble, every development is being observed as a part of the pro cess by which tho larger nations oi Europe are seeking the dismemberment of the Chinese empire. As one diplo matic official stated: "It is the obsorp- tlon of the Orient by the Occident." In such a movement It Is understood that the position of this government would be that of a disinterested observ er always active, however, to protect those American interests which have been built up at ths, large treaty ports. At present there is no suggestion that these may be affected but the con troversy is assuming such a phase that it may extend at any time beyond the question of occupying Kiao Chou bay and involve the treaty ports as well as all China. This is the view taken "by soma of the best posted diplomatic officials. It is said, also, that if the process goes on, Europe must not learve out of ac-. count, Japan, because Japan will in sist on recognition if there is to ba any occupation of Chinese territory, froman authoritative source the follow ing statement was made as to the gen eral status of tho German-Chinesa case: . -. Kiao Chou bay is midway between the northern and southern portions of the Chinese coast and has a command ing stategic importance The harbor is broad and deep and is adapted for ths uses of a large fleet The Chinese gov-. ernment had determined to improve the fortifications and bring the. place up to modem standards, China has not made any preparations for war by assembling troops or ships to resist Germany's landing.- It is still believed that a set tlement will be reached through politi cal means and that it will be honorable to China as well as satisfactory to Ger mny.' China hopes that Germany will con fine her efforts to securing redress for her missionary citizens and will not ex ten4. them to terirtorial questions. . It is said that China will not allow her" honor to be lmpunged by the dismem berment of her territory. There was a suggestion at one time that the United States occupied such a disinterested po sition that it could with propriety ten der its good offices as between Ger many and China. This has not taken official flavor. i , - f 

GERMAN NAVAL BILL, Herr Ricliter Draws Conclusion from Dbja - play of Power in China. Berlin, Dec 7. In the reichstag, Hers . Richter, the radical leader, during the- debate upon the first' reading of the naval bill opposed that measure and dwelt upon the serious Increase of ex penditures. He contended that the great display of power made in China, proved that the government considered' the navy equal to the task Imposed up on it, Admiral von Tlernltz declared the fleet was inadequate and that the government was obliged to send away all its efficient cruisers and even em ploy training ships as men-of-war. He said the influence of cruisers abroad depended chiefly upon the power known to stand behind them, namely, the fleet of battleships. Herr Lleber, the' centre party leader, said his party had not yet got their votes ready. He thought the time had come for the leg islature to deal with the navy, and, if the government would promise that the burdens would be shared by those parts of the world which profited thereby, nine-tenths of the opposition to the bill would be removed.
