London, Dec. 2.—The work of chart ing a new map of what hitherto has been European Turkey, will begin im mediately after the signatures of the Turkey and the Balkan allies at the village ofg Baghtche tomorrow. If the allies are able to agree among them selves as to the portions of the spoils they are to receive there seems no probability of a resumption of hostilities. The comparatively favorable terms which from al laccounts have been of fered by the allies to Turkey are so different from the original proposals that they seem to suggest the idea that the governments of the Balkan league realize that with winter grip ping the country Turkey has gained an ally which will prove more fatal to ithe armies fronting Adrianople, Scu- tari and Tchatalja than have been the Ottoman cannon. No adjustment of the Austro Servian dispute is yet visible. Vienna continues to show pessimism and the newspapers there maintain their threatening attitude, but in spite of this, official relations between St. Petersburg and Vienna seem to have become somewhat more cordial, and it Is thought In diplomatic quarters that eventually Servla will obtain a small mercantile port on the Adriatic sea connected with Servla by railroad. In the meantime, however, Servia has trodden on the toes of Italy by quartering a regiment of troops who recently occupied the port of Durazso in, the' Italian school building there. An energetic request to have the troops^ removed has been made, by, the Italian consul On instruction's from Rome. .American Ships Arrive Washington D.

This amount, which does not include any provision for the postal service, which is expect ed to be self-supporting, is an increase of $72,074,248 over the appropriations made for the present year by the last session of congress. Navy Wants More Ships. Of this Increase $28,312,220 appears in the estinlfates of the secretary, of the navy, and $20,597,207 represents the increase asked by the navy depart ment In the appropriation for building and equipping new vessels.- The esti mates would provide for three new battleships to be laid down during the year. This would make up for the iapsed of one ship from the two battle ship a year program in the depart ment, caused by th6 action of the democratic house in providing for but a single ship at the last session of congress. Increase In Pensions. Another $20,000,000 or more of the total increase is shown in the esti mates for the payment of pensions. The amount asked for is $185,220,000.

The work to be done during the year on the Panama canal will cost $30,174, 432. which is $1,130,567 less than the appropriations for the current year.

Among the estimates, which will de velop debate in congress Is a demand for $250,000 for the economy and effi ciency commission, appointed by President Taft which is investigating and reforming the system of conduct ing the government business in the various departments.

He has also Intimated that he1 will send nominations for vacancies now several months old, which he has ignored up to date. The democratic senators, out of Spen ower for sixteen years, are standing mouthed, waiting for patronage plums. They are so hungry that they have threatened to block all nomina tions of the president for the, next three months, thereby increasing the number of big places Woodrow Wilson will dispope of and making certain of the reappointment of democrats four years from now, just before the close of the administration. The opening skirmish will be had over the confirmation of Edgar E, Clark of Iowa, who has just been re named for a seven year term 6n the interstate commerce commission by the president. In announcing that he would appoint Clark for another term, the president declared that he intend ed ']to fill every. vacancy. The senate democrats, however, are prepared to question his right to do so on the eve of a democratic administration and they will appeal to their republican colleagues to stand by them In their fight against the president. As the republicans are divided In the senate, the president will get but few confirmations from now on. How ever. he will plant a mine which If it is not carefully looked after will ex plode and blow up the entire Wilson administration. Younger Democrats Insurglng. The balance of power in favor of the democrats In the upper body will be so small in the sixty-third congress, that pretty nearly any peevish sena tor can upset it and cause trouble .for Mr. Wilson.

The older law-makers are appalled at their nerve, but helpless before them If they really try to carry out their de signs.

There are none who were there during the open ing of that administration when the Louisiana democrats forced the presi dent and his party on the shoals. Then the balance of power was Just as slight as it will be after March 4. Btft none of the senators can point with personal experience to the havoc of those days. Now if these youtger democrats get into a fight with their older brethren over the committee chairmanships, there will be an excellent opportunity for the republicans to block every appointment the president makes where the office is filled by a republi can who will hold on until his succes- {Continued on Page 10.)
