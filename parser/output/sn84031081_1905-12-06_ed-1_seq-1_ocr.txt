Meat Cove, C. B., Dec. 5. Eleven lives were lost as a result of the strik ing of the steamer Luenenberg on the rocks off Amherst harbor,' near the Magdalena Islands yesterday.

The accident occurred In a violent storm, the dan gers of a terrific sea being Increased bv blinding snow. After the steamer struck the storm abated sufficiently for five of those on board to row to land. The others decided to remain on the vessel until calm weather, but later in the day under the beating of tremendous waves the steamer began to go to pieces and it became neces sary for them to leave In one of the ship's boats. When the twelve men were about half way to the shore, a great wave swamped their craft. Cap tain Pride, of the Luenenberg, manag ed to cling to the boat until help reached him. FISHERMEN MAKE BRAVE ATTEMPT TO ItENCTE THE CHEW Etang Du Nord, Magdalena Islands, Dec. 6. Full particulars of the loss of the steamer Luenenberg with one of her owners, R. I. Leslie, and ten of her crew at Outer Sand Beach, oppo site Amherst Harbor, ten miles south of this port, were received today. The steamer struck the beach during a thick snow storm early yesterday morning and is a total wreck. The steamer and cargo were valued at üo.ooo. The steamer was attempting to en ter Amherst harbor at the time of the disaster. The thick northeast snow storm prevailed and a heavy sea con stantly swept the vessel's decks. The lighthouse at Amherst could be seen at times, however, and Captain Pride supposed he cleared the beach. Sud denly a great wave literally picked up the steamer and left her stranded di rectly opposite the entrance to the harbor. Attempts to float the craft proved useless, but all hands were able to keep themselves from being washed overboard, 'although the seas contin uously swept the decks. Two hours after daylight the wreck was sighted from the shore. A number of fishermen put off in a boat and took off five of the crew. At this time the steamer was apparently little damaged and the others declined to abandon her. At 1 o'clock In the afternoon the storm Increased In violence and those on shore saw that the steamer was doomed to destruction. Mr. Leslie, Captain Pride and the other men on the vessel lowered a boat and attempted to reach land, not a great distance away, but In the furious seas the crew could make little head way. Fishermen on the Island saw the boat launched, but the storm quickly shut off their view. The fishermen started for the wreck, but when they reached the scene they found that the steamer's boat had been overturned, and that of the dozen men who were in her. only one remained. The person was Captain Pride. He clung to the overturned boat until rescued by the fishermen. Mr. Leslie was a member of the provincial parliament of Que bec from the Magdalena Island dis trict.

There are seventy-one of these, and they control trade with an Iron hand, and they have given orders not to handle American goods. It Is almost impossible to gel at them. Of course, we have treaties guaranteeing free circulation of our goods, but suppos ing the coolies on the docks, the car riers on the streets and everybody con. nected. with the handling of goods re fuses to touch them, what are you to do? .

These men make tours of the stores and keep a close, check on the American goods Intro duced Into China. At first these men I use persuasion to Induce the Chinese ! merchants lo abandon the trade with j America. If this falls, then the store! is placarded. ' "Certain of our wares, like piece I goods, are not under the ban. When j I was there they were making a hard I fight against American cigarettes. Am-' erlcan goods are divided Into the ac-' cepted and boycotted classes. But If the contributions from this country failed and the 'walking delegates' were , out of a Job, there would soon be an end to It all. i "I tried to learn how extensively the , boycott had spread, but even the best posted merchants were unable to est!- ! male the effect In the Interior. Time I will work out an answer to the ques- tlon', but when the agitation ends It, will, not bo a 'difficult matter lo allay; the Interior sentiment." ,
