Tlte Sunlury DtmocmL, determined to he in time, respectfully submits tbe f Mowing imposing list of candidates to next Democratic National Conven tion. The Democrat does not indicate own preference, but thinks the con vent ion should be able to nominate a good ' icKe: from this iist an* not fum b\ ...omti tin the mW for dark horses : Fon PRESIDENT : Samuel J. Tildeu, of New York, Governor Cleveland, 44 Samuel J. lUcdall, of Pennsylvania, VV. S. Hancock, 44 Thomas A. Cyard, of Delaware, Thorn & A. IlcDdricks, of Indiana, William S. Holm an. 44 Aien (*. Thurman of Ohio, FOR VICE PRESIDENT Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana, Cx-Senator Mc Donald, 14 Kx-Gov. Pi!mir, of Illinois, (i "iv St one man, o£ California, Gov. Grant, of Calorario, L S. Walters, of Connecticut, 7. U. Henael, of Pennsylvania. A President's message is about the greatest bore on a poor, harnused coun try euitcr there is. It is worse than the elephant which a New Jersey fellow won at a shooting match. One does not know at all how to handle or what t> do with it. To publish it entire is it lei ly out of the question—squarely i:a ;o3 l >h. M the fiiv wuo care to read it entire have done so from the dailies loug before their weekly paper can publish it. Cut off the head and v >u have a shapeless mass of words cal culated more to provoke than to please our rulers ; lop off the tail and you ti tlee matters worse instead of im i.roving them, and if you dissect the dy yon destroy all symmetry and pro ortion. It were indeed a real pity to reat Arthur's message so rudely, for be poor fellow had agony more than e r.ougli to frame and fit it together, and -.■ van when complete it seems to disap point all aud 3uit none. No ; we will not annoy our reader* v.'.th trie President's message or any > irt of it. Our space is fully takea up with other, and- as we feel satisfied more acs ptable matter. ■— Senator Butler Re-elected. 

COLUMBIA, S. C. December stb. General M. C. Butler was to-day re-e - the General Assembly United Nates Senator. Colonel 11. S. Thom m was inaugurated Governor. He ieliyered an address touchng on na tional as well as home affairs. The greenback vote in Indiana hav ■ r_4 increased 113 in two years, it is es v • too that at the same ratio of in .-35130, that party will take control of Tie Nate iu 1057, . lie Democratic State Couraaitee will M -it Ilarrisburg on the third Mon i iu January, for organization under new rules adopted t>y the last Dera • ',it!e State Couvaation. The suggestion that Mr. Curtin be urged for the speaker-ship of the House meets with more favor as It grows older. The Lewistown Free Press is the last of the many journals of the dis tnct who approve of It.— Clinton Democrat. Wo consider it rather unseasona ble at this time if not circctlv un wise, to urge our distinguished mem her for the position of Speaker. If done merely to "compliment' our grand old Ex-Governor it may be all right, but certainly docs nogrwl. We very much doubt whether Gov. Curtin has any desires in that di rection himself. With all his great abilities he does not claim to be a trained parlimcntcrinn, a la Randall, that anybody knows of, and perhaps lacks the physical strength so ncc essarv for a Speaker to possess. Gov. Curtin's natural and proper sphere will be as leader of the house —.and don't any of you forget it. There his high order of states menship, coupled with his brilliant and masterly powers of or atory will be of more service to the country than in the Speaker's chair and there he can hit Speaker Ky phtr oftencr and hardei than he could as presiding officer of the House. THE figures given by the the United Slates in his report forj„the yeur 1882 are strong arguments in favor tif the reduction of taxation. The to tal increase in net revenue of the gov ernment for the present year over 

ISSI jis $42,742,957.71. This shows an in crease from customs of $22,251,004,2s ; from internal revenue, SI 1,233.209,81 ; from sales ot public lands, $2,5s 1,277,- 20, and from miscellaneous sources $6,- 707,415. The ret expenditures decrease from $200,712,887 to $257,181,440, a re ductiou of $2,741,447. Apparently the whole internal revenue system mav be wiped out and still leave the govern ment plenty of money to defray all ne cessary expenses. If civil service je form is to be practically established, there can be no reason why four thous and oflice ho Iders should be retained at a cost of five millions o! dollars per year for the purpose of collecting need less revenues, nor can the people be longer expected to bear the burdens of unnecessary taxation.— Patriot. We agree entirely with the Patriot in all but one point. Let the entire internal revenue system be "wiped out' 1 from our statute books one swoop, excepting only the tax on whis key and tobac co. Whiskey drinkers, smokers and cbewers ought to pay the bigger part of the balance of our na tional debt without grumbling. TNE TENURE OF THE OFFICERS.— The Governor and Lieutenant Gover nor elected in Pennsylvania on the 7th of November will hold office for four years ; the Secretary of Internal Affairs for three yeats, and tbe Judge of tbe Supreme Court for twenty-one yeara. Twenty-eight Congressmen were chosen to serve two years ; twen ty-five State Senators to seir four years, and tbe entire membership of the lower House for two years. IIE WILL BE LONELY.—The Green backers will have a single Rcpresenta tive in the Forty-eight Congress, in the person of Hon. Charles X. Brumm, of the thirteenth district of Pennsylva nia. in t!>e present Congress there are nine Greenbnckert. There is one thing that won't woriy Brumm—attending party caucuses. California pilititia ns express the o pinion tlmt t he Chinese restrictive law can be easily amended bv congress so that its c oustitutionality should be in ; disputable. They therefore oppose the suggestion of the national labor con gress that the law should l>e tested in the courts. Imperfect as the law is it has had the effect of almost stopping Chinese emigration to this country. Moreover huudreds of Chinamen have departed for their own land, and hive not returned to this country. 

GCOVER CLEVELAND, Governor-e --lect of New York, in addition to his Democratic majority against boss rule seems to have several characteristics in common with Governor-elect Pattison. He has declined the proffered services of a military company on inauguration day and expresses an earnest wish that there shall be as little ceremony on that occasion as possible. This seems to be a year in which Democratic Governors are thoroughly democratic. Not That Kind of Legislature. It must be understood that the legis lature Isn't going to give a roll of Brus sels carpet, an oil painting, a case of penknives and enough shaving mugs to start a barber shop to every member. It must stop at the shaving mugs, any how. • • A Washington special says : There is very general unanimity among the republicans in the house in charging the defeat of the party to Robeson's profligate leadership and his river and harbor plunder. The defeated republi can members are very bitter against Robeson,and he will receive many hard blows from his own household if he at tempts to lead this session. Gov. Pattison will be inaugurated, Tuesday, J in. 16th. The legislature meets Tuesday, Jan. 2nd, just two weeks before the inauguration.
