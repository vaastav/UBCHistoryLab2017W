PASSES fly very low about this time of year in the vicinity of the homos of members of the legislature. The wisest marksmen will lot thorn severely - ly alone. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THIRTEEN seats will bo contested In the coming legislature , five in the sonatoand eight in the houso. In the senate the floats of Schonhoit , re publican , Oanfiold , democrat , Baum- gardner , republican , Filloy , republi can , and Kinkoid , republican , are contested ; in the house the ooato of Johnson and flosmor , republicans ; M'Gavock , democrat , Oastlo , republi can , and Chambers , Taylor , Oooko and Walpho , republicans , are also contested. THE BEE gives up a i&rgo portion of its apace this morning to the prosi- dont'o message. It ii a foroiblo and business-Iiko document which treats exhaustively the various living issues of the hour. For the firat time in the political history of the country n. the president's message contains an earnest appeal for anti-monopoly legislation and calls attention to the evasion of local taxation by the land grant roads. The country will applaud the sentiments of the chief executive as to the necessity of an immediate reduction in the national revenues and a prompt readjustment of the tariff with a view to equalize its burdens. The tariff is a tax , and its benefits are far too partially divided. In his suggestions regarding civil ser vice reform , Proeidont Arthur offers 9 i * few new ideas. Ho seems to appro clato the difficulty of securing any reform which would moot all the demands of the extreme wihg of the civil service reformers and contents himself by urging the adoption of a measure which will pro vide for fixity of term and security in tenure. This is probably tbo only remedy practiciblo at present. Ono of the most important recommendations tions of the president is the adoption of a constitutional amendment permit ting the chief executive to veto any item in au appropriation bill , Suoh an amendment long sinoo became a necessity to prevent the omnibus leg islatlon with which every session ol congress has been cursed. An Item of Truth. Scliujlw Sun. Whatever may bo the result of the election in Nebraska , the self-const i tnted leaden of the republican party must surely have found in the events of the campaign material for a decided ly practical lesson. The spirit of Independence - dependence manifeated la without a parallel in the political hiitory of the State. . Men whose attachment to the principle ! of the * republican party is beyond the possibility of question , have faltered In their allegiance and for the first time in twenty years voted against the party candidates. Scores of others have been held to a luke warm acquloscencoby the circumstance of local interests or a reluctance to abandon a bad matter for a worse. This is a weak and dangerous position for any political party to occupy , even though that party boasts of thirty thousand majority. And the end is not yot. Any ono who imagines that this agitation and .assertion of indo pondenoo is peculiar to the present year , is too llmitedlucomprohonaion to draw conclusions from facts. So long as there exista good reasons why it should , this agitation will continue , and the * revolt against bossUni and railroad dictation will grow until the political history of Pennsylvania findu its parallel in Nobra&ka , It has boon assorted , and with no small degree of truth , that ton mon and the railroada oxerolto practical control of'tho re public * " party in Nebraska ; and two men m < l the railroads exercise abso lute cou'rol of what little there is of the docu Mi-atio party id the itnte. Is it lurpiulofl then that men grow weary of thU political serfdom that the party war whoop falls to evoke the old time enthuiJum , ad that there is .a milder rMpouM to the crack oj the I v party lr h ? The spread eagle oratory and itoreotyped figures of ipooeh hare become old and threadbare. The patriotism and grandeur of Abraham Lincoln supply no good reason why there should be a dishonost.distlnctlon in the assessment of corporate property and that of the humble citizen. The liberation of four mil lion human beings from the degrada tion of slavery was a magnificent achievement , but it docs not argue that willing tools should bo elevated to high positions of trust. The strain upon patriotism becomes too great when one is compelled to wear a tag to keep within the lines of "tho grand old party. " Unless a party can ba the result of intelligent thought and hon > ant conviction it isn't ' worth preserv ing when the honett voter holds his nose as ho walks to the b&llot box it is time to bury the corpse. And this is not an overdrawn 'picture it is the sentiment -nino-tonths of the rank and file of the republican party. Men ire not weary of republicanism , but , hey are heartily tired of many of Hio men nnd methods that govern. Inject lioncst leadership into the republican ? arty of this state nnd it Is Invincible , jnt lot It follow in the line of its re cent policy nnd division nnd disrup tion will follow just ns death succeeds disease , _

RAILROAD NOTES- Special UIipatchuB to TUB Ilia. A DEl'OT BUD. CHICAGO , Ducombor 4. At the city council mooting to-night Mayor Harrison risen was instructed to negotiate with the Michigan Central railroad for the sale of throe blocks on the lake front , north of Monroe struct , for not loss than $800,000. This is considered equivalent to the sale of this long dia putod property , ns the road mentioned nan offered to take it by ita motes nnd bounds nt the Dgure named. CUTT1KU IUTE8 TO OMAHA. The statement will bo published hero in the morning that the Illinois Central railroad will mnko the freight rate fifteen cents per 100 pounds , re gardless of classification , from Olicago to Omaha to correspond with the rate from Omaha to Chicago , unless the warring roads in the northwest at once restore rates between Chicago and Sioux City , That they will do this is considered improbable. The proposed out by the Illinois Central would In volve the Iowa pool lines , generally. A OABIIIEHaicira. . BUVKALO , December 4. The audi tor of the Lake fihpro railroad la busi ly engaged examining the accounts of S.

THU 0UL1 > UOADH BT. Louis , Dooombor 4.The dis patch sent from ' hero 1mt night , noting reductions in 'freight rate * by the Gould roads to points iu Texas and Louisiana , was based on an article prepared pared for and published in the Glebe Democrat this morniug , That ptper will to-morrow print the following on the same subject : "J , J. Kogora , assistant pencral freight agent of the Missouri I'acifio and Iron Mountain railway , says the only changes made on the Texan nnd Laulitana business was to tnoludo the bridge toll on through and local business so as to compete with the Mallery line of steamers from Now York , The action Was , however , superinduced by the og. creative policy of the Cairo Short Line , which utfertd shippers the samu terai by their rorLwd circulars issued about fifteen days go. A GREAT WATER WAY , Known in Song And Story aS the lad Missouri , Exhibit of the Freightage This Sooooii. Greater Tonnnge Than Ever Be fore Qood Government Work- Ht. l' ul Ptontcr-IVras. This aoason of stoatnboatlng on the Missouri river nboro Bismarck , re cently closed , lias boon a greater suc cess than over before , BO far no trips and tonnage are coneernod , but the owners of boats again claim a balance on the wiong side ot the ledger , and scan the figures with anything bat n satisfactory nin It is an open secret that rates have boon low , The different ont lines have boon willing to give rates which wore as far as possible from "living" ones if only they could boat a rival line , and a war of very respectable proportions has been on the tapis throughout the season. Of course shippers hare profited , and the hearts of the far-off traders are glad within them , It was predicted last year that the completion of the North ern Pacific to Glondlvo and beyond would be n disastrous if not Fatal blow to steambontin ? on the Missouri , and would run orory boat out of the Yollowotono. As to the first river , the appended figures show the prediction to have been unfulfilled. As to the latter It was largely true , but this is duo in some measure to natural rather than constructive causes. The Yellowstone has never been a eafo stream to.count upon. Llko its tributary , the Big Horn , when the molting snows in the mighty canon * of Montana and Wyom ing swell its Ibods , it is deep enough and wide enough to float a t > avy , but the very current , which renders all the power ft boat has necessary for its stcrrfmlng , empties the stream so soon that a boat-may go up on unbounded water and ground on her own nose on the return trip Government work has helped the navigability in a moas- nro , but it would bo hard to find an experienced captain or pilot who would class the Yellowstone among the great transportation attarios beneficently ordained to keep down rates of trans portation by competing with a rail way. A DIFFERENT IlIVEll. With the Missouri it b different , ind the work by government engineers baa resulted in suoh positive good that bho most captious are forced to ac knowledge it. The river hai never boon as low as last season. The low water mark was sunk four inches' be low that of any previous year since the stream has boon gauged , end not withstanding this tbo trips have been more frequent for the number of boats engaged , greater tonnage to the vessel has boon possible , and far off Fort Benton has boon reached oftener than over before , Footed river men ascribe these rosulta largely to the govern mental work done between Cow Island ind Fort Claggott , where the stream is little better than a succession of rapids which , at low water , was for merly next to impassable. The Juno rlao came as usual , of course , but it was neither as heavy nor aa long con tinued as usual ) * and by the middle of August the hugo spars and the croak ing nitrgur-engine were again in con stant requisition. The fuel supply has been excellent in quality and quantity and the prica has bt on low enough to suit even a clerk on n sin gle stacker. The way traffic not in cluded In the figures given below has grown into dimensions which as tonish passengers of a few years ago , when a aback in the course of a day's run and a solitary poet every few hun dred miles wcro the only signs of whlto inhabitants , though of red ripa rians there was no lack , and bullet holes in a pilot house were then as plenty as the sight of a Sioux along the banks Is , nowadays , rare. AIUUVALH AMU DEPAKTUKKS. Bismarck and Maudan , opposite , are now points of departure in the spring , so that the first boat Is sent oat on or about the same date every year , and not , as formerly , after it had finished thn hundreds of miles between those points and Bt. Louis or Plttsbnrg. The season of 1882 saw a ilaot of twenty- two steamers ready for the Missouri and the Yellowstone tivor traffic , the latter , as before stated , scarcely count ing , so slight was it as compared with the aggregate. The Eollpao was the first boat of the Hoaaon to pull out for up river , which eho did April 10 , n number following in the days imme diately succeeding. The closing of navigation is usually from the 1st to the 15th of November , and this year the Batto arrived from above and wont into winter quarters Nov. 10 , the last uctil 1883 , During the season there were eighty-six departures and eighty- five arrivals from and at Bismarck , and only two trips all told were made on the Yellowstone. At Fort Beaten , the head of navigation and more than 1,300 miles above Bismarck , there were forty arrivals daring the season an unusual number , and fully at testing the excellent effect of the gov ernment work. The Benton boats , too , notwithstanding the generally low water , were able to take much heavier freights than usual , and this ability , as may cosily be imagined , is an im portant factor in transportation cover ing BO long and tortuous a courso. On ly ono boat carao to grief , but this was the Hod Cloud , onq of the largest and handsomest , which struck a submerged stump near Bouoho's grave , about sixty miles from Fort Pock , and sunk almost instantly. The boat w&s a to tal loss. A largo part of the carao was saved. The total vnlno of the twenty- two boats was $403 000 , arid tha R . grogato tonuago 8,400 , custom houao measurement , FREIGHT UPBTIIKAM The following table of freights oar- rlod up stream from Bismarck may bo rolled upon as absolutely correct , and it is the first ono of the kind over pub- Halted BO soon after the close of navi gation ; I'rlv.

The valuations of the freight wore : Private freight $2,000,000 GoTCrnmcnt freight , 510,000 Total $3,111,000 It is Impossible to figure accurately the amount of frolghtago paid on the above amount , but it is over $250,000 on private freight alone.

PRODUCTS FltOM ABOVE , A very intosting exhibit is made of products brought by the boats from Fort Benton in particular and Mon- tanajn general , The return frelghls to Bismarck are summed as follows : Product Amount * .

A notable feature is the shipment (28,000) ( ) of Buffalo hides , and it shows conclusively where the largo herds roamed during the sfoson. The banks of the Upper Missouri were their favorite stamping grounds , and. the hide-hunter found that the river was right to his hand , and shipped ac cordingly. The total weight of south east bound freight was 3,000,000 pounds , a far greater number than ever shipped boforo. WHERE THE FREIOUT COMKfl FROM. Ono point in regard to the freight shipped north and west from Bhmarak as n port of river departure , is whence It comes. River mon say that the to tal of nearly 28,000,000 pounds , only 2,500,000 pounds camoup stream from St. Louie , and all the rest came from the east and by rail. The east means , largely , St. Paul , but the vessel own- era nrguo that St. "Paul got it firnt from Now York and other Atlantic-board cities , whence comes the greatest howl concerning appropriations for the improvement of western rivers. They go on to point out how rapidly the valley of " the Missouri" and these of closely trib utary streams are settling up now , and what a tide will pour therein when the Indians are settled on small er reservations. They farther arj uo that for many years theoo people will bo largely dependent upon steamboats for transportation facilities , and the feVj.itti i.o itxiiitioB the greater the transportation and the larger tbo amount of eastern product to bo shipped into the country. Ergo , they conclude it is a mark of folly in east ern mon to oppose appropriations which , honestly and carefully cxpond- od render the navigation of a mighty river , throughout the entire , season , profitable , It may ba noted , in conclusion , that though the boat owner'all avur they have carried a big but losing business , none of them show any symptoms of withdrawing themselves fiom the trade next year , and a season even moro prosperous than that of 1882 may bo confidently expected in 1883. RAILROAD TERRITORY. CHICAGO , December 4. A number of railroad managers wore interviewed on the position President Parker , of the Omaha line , that the question of territory belonging to the various roads and not to ba built into by others , must bo decided , are about evenly divided , half agreeing and the other half disagreeing with him.
