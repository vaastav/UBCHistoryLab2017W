AUSTRIA. The message of President Wilson lo Congress yesterday, rin . which h . urged a declaration of war on 'Aus-; tria, surprised no wcil-posted Amor-! ienn. Many, including prominent Congressmen, thought this act:oi.| should have been taken some time ago. Like messages heretofore sent Congress by Mr. Wilson, it was o the point and practically unanswer able. Systematic hostile and surreptitious unneutral acts on1 the part of Aus-( tria-Hungary have driven this coun try to the exact position she was In with regard to Germany before 'he' declaration of war on April <>, lf'17. Sac pursued ruthless submarine war-' fare, although 0:1 much smaller seal. 'ban Germany. She carried on a pro paganda of disloyalty To tliiS' coun iry just like Germany. She used her diplomatic agents in the Unite;-. States to foment- discord, incendiar ism and destruction. Dr. Constantino Dumba was sent out of this country bees use he was concerned in starl ing strikes, and fires in munition-: factories in this country. The President, however, still ?? :'<ls the olive branch and appea r. ?!? .-reasonable people in the centrai empires. lie says when the Gorman people have spokesmen whose. wo: I we can believe and when those ..pokesmen are ready in the name of :boirv people to accept the common ,'udgrfccnt of the nations as to win: ?red! henceforth be the bases of and of covenant for the life of the world, the United States shall he willing and glad to pay the full prl;e ;.'T peace, and pay it imgrudgingly.

JUVENILE COURT. There were two cases l/c Police Court this morning. The t e fendants were five boys?four w - one colored. The wh^te ^io were charged with stealing been brought into, court by Offi ~r Snellings, but he hud been unable to ascertain the name of the ownc of the wire. The colored boy had. been taken from the platform o? ? electric train which he had uoarucu on south Royal street tor the purine It obtaining a free ride. His motner was in court, and he being but twcUc; voars old, he was turned over to h -. "for correction. She ?s;ho??:i told that should she fail to pi 0 him from committing misdemeanor^, the authorities would take charge . should he be brought to cour. airain. * i The four white boys had .procured wire somewhere and disposed of i to a junk dealer. Their ages ranged from nine to twelve veins o ' anil their parents appeared in - with them. After the evidencej in U case had been heard, also confcssic;s of the juvenile offenders, then 1 ,.nfs were assured that if tney co ? no! control them, the authorities ;0uld. and that they must see to d tint their offsprings dcpoit l, properly in future.

Justice Crutchfield. of Ricomonu. ?ume time ago adopted a role by which he held parents ri-sponsible Tur the acts of their offspring. A boy who was armed with a cat ride had been using the same m ? streets notwithstanding the protests of neighbors. He was finally arrest and brought before Justice Cru.cn ficM, who ascertained that the ii.U had been given him by his father. The latter was summoned into court and fined ten dollars for furnis.mg Ins offspring with the weapon. .The mother of one of the youi stors. observed this morning that ncr boy committed overt acts wnlie goi.-.g to * and returning from school at sum times being out of her sight, toe word pedagogue in ancient ?sa>* meant a servant who accompanied a pupil to and from school in order to m,toot him from ill-treatment *r insults. In our day if would seem tha. pedagogues might he used witn pro fit in order to keep.pupils from com mitting unlawful acts in going to or returning from school. A I'STUIA CULPABLE. he Neur Freic I'rosse, of Vienna, | is correct in saying' that overtures for peace between Austria and Eng- ? lard should be opened by the former,-; but this is not because o. any mis-: understandings between Germany and 1 England since the death of Queen ?Victoria, which have nothing what ever to do with the case. As the Philadelphia Record says, I any peace negotiations should be? gun bv Austria because it is the j h a 1'ng criminal. It was Austria; which nearly precipitated the world ! v.-.-r by it- appropriation of Bosnia! in iOOS. It was Austria which ? would j have precipitated the-world''war in: Ai gust. l!?t-'!. 10 months before the i assassination of the- Austrian Arch- j duke, because the Balkan wars Ind j resulted in weakening the German ally. Turkey, and in strengthening! the Russian protege. Servia. A us-1 uia refrained on that occasion only > because Italy would not join, and! Germany still had a few more mili-1 ir.ry preparations to make before .it was qui*e ready to back Austria in ! a world war. These Germany made ( i: the spring of 19Id. and then it was , ready fcr war. .t wa> Austria which sent to Ser-' via. on account cf a murder commit ted in Austrian territory, such an ultimatum as no Government ever addressed to another, and refused to accept the Servian reply, which was ! abject in its acceptance of all the; Austrian demands but one. and only I w.shed some further discussions of I that one. It was Austria which re- i fused to extend the -IS hours of the ultimatum 0'* to delay the movement[ of its army. Every effort at peace! bv negotiation was flouted. And new that Austria and Ger-j many have failed to enforce their sort of peace upon the world by the sword, they are eager to obtain peace by 'negotiation. It is certainly Austria's place to ask for peace I'VIYU-. Bu! ;it tlu: SM'po t?m<- :i Bud j apcst paper is demanding 9273 square miles of Rumania, the joint control with Bulgaria of the Danube, the abolition of the Serriah army and the maintenance of some dummy of Austria as King of Servia. The war will go on until Austria and Ger many get into a different state of mirvd. So long as they are in their present mood, peace "with them would not. last long enough to be worth getting. 

WILL BELGIUM BE REPEATED? (Richmond Times-Dispatch) European dispatches announce Germany's determination to seize Denmark, overrun it and possibly swallow it up in order to counter the allies' reported move in establishing a naval base on the Norwegian coast. This story comes straight from Co penhagen, reciting the alarm of the Danes ;-?d an appeal from them L<> I he entente to prevent their sacrifice to German ruthlessness. The truth is, Norway has granted nc concessions whatever to the al lies; no naval base is about to be oc cupied by them on Norwegian soil and no occasion exists for German aggression against Denmark. Both N(?rwav and Denmark have main tained their neutrality from t'ne be ginning of the war, notwithstanding tb:* ?'.ivages which Germany has perpetrated against those small na tions. But it is evident that Germany anticipates a concerted naval drive once the American battle fleet takes its station in European waters, and in order to fortilv itself against this, it is seeking some pretext upon which Denmark may be Rolgianizcd. Once that country is invaded by Ger many, the Danes know that the Ger mans would not quit it- at the point < f the sword. For half a century Germany lias had its greedy eyes fixed upon Den ji.i'iii. Belgium and Holland. It. has coveted an opportunity to wipe these sjv-all states from the map, absorb ing them as Bavaria, Alsace and Lor laine were absorbed, but no peaceable means has ever offered itself for the execution of German designs upon its neighbors. No sooner was war de clared against France, however, than Belgium was overrun and all of it oc cupied except a strip of territory in Flanders. Holland has saved itself by allowing Germany to use it as a channel through which neutral mar kets beyond were reached. Denmark ?"vasrieft alcne for a time, but there seems no doubt that, it was marked for slaughter when "military neces sity" should arise. Whether or net Germany now con eludes that that necessity exists prob ably will be determined within a short time. Nor will it matter whether or not Norway remains neutral. Bel gium was neutral, but that did no* save it. and Norway's neutrality will not save Denmark if Germany feels that the time lias arrived "or another conquest.
