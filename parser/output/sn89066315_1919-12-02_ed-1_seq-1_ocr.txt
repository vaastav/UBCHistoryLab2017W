WILSON in issue RECOWIWiENDS BUDGET Deals With Domestic Issues, Avoiding Treaty and League of Nations. .URGES LABOR LAWS No Class Can Dictate to Na tion, He Says Wants a Tribunal. tiy United Press. WASHINGTON', Dec. 2. President Wilson in his message to Congress this morning recommended: Establishment of a national budget fsystem. The simplification of income and excess profit taxes. 1 Legislation to obtain employment and land for soldiers. Laws encouraging increased produc tion. Protection of America's new chemi cal and dye-stuff industries. Development of natural resources. Enactment of the legislation pro posed by A. Mitchell Palmer, attorney-general, dealing with Reds. Legislation to reduce the cost of living and extend the Lever Food Con trol Act. Laws bringing about the democrati zation of industries, including the par ticipation of workers in decisions af fecting their welfare. Establishment of the principles re garding labor as laid down in the la bor section of the League of Nations. Avoided League of Nations. By L. C. 

MARTIN (United Press Staff Correspondent) WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. President Wilson today sent to Congress his mes sage, consisting of an extensive pro gram ot reconstructive legislation. His communication was devoted en tirely to the greater problems con fronting the nation. Although the President referred sev eral times to the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations he did not dis cuss the situation. He will do so in a later message, it was learned. He will also discuss the railroad question in a later communication, he informed legislators. Much of the message was devoted to the labor problems. To solve thesel problems, the President saidr "Con gress must now help in the task of finding a method of bringing about the general democratization of indus try based on the recognition of the rights of those workers of whatever rank to participate in some organized way in every decision directly affect ing their welfare. Old Standards Impossible. "No betters means to this end can be found than to apply in legislation the principles set up in the labor sec tion of the League of Nations cove nant. To go back to the old 'stan dards of labor andwages is impossi ble. The age-long antagonism be tween capital and labor must be end ed before real world stability can be accomplished." The President warned Congress against anti-strike legislation. "The right of individuals to strike is inviolable and a right which must not be interfered with by the 'govern ment, but the government has the dominating right to protect all its people against the challenge of any single class," he said. Recommends a Labor Tribunal. The President recommended the es tablishment of a tribunal before which disputes between labor and capital might be settled. The blame for unrest in the coun try was partly placed upon the Sen ate because of its failure to ratify the Peace Treaty. The President appealed again for the enforcement of the comprehensive program which he proposed at the spcial session of Congress to lower living costs, only pne measure of which became law. The program in cludes the extension of the Lever Food Control Act, close regulation of food distribution and cold storage and licensing of all corporations dealing in interstate commerce. Urges n Budget System. President Wilson opened his recom mendation with the hope that a budg et system will be established which will put the estimate for appropria tions in the hands of the President, which will eliminate the great dupli cation in Congress by reason of the number of committees dealing with appropriations and provide an audit system to see whether the money is well spent. I "There is immediate necessity for simplifying income and excess profits taxes," the President said. He warned that if income and prof- fit tax rates are left too high they may prove destructive to business and not produce revenue. He also warned against building a train wall so high as to be prohibi tive to European manufacturers. "Un less Europe, can sell goods here, no iS money will come to this country," he said. "If we want to sell we must be prepared to buy," he said, declar ing against a policy of isolation through prohibitive tariff. Would Protect Dye Industries. "Tariff legislation protecting 'the chemical, and dye-stuff Industries in this country against Germany's efforts to regain this trade is, however, nec essary," the President declared. He repeated his reqeust for legisla tion to provide farms for soldiers and recommended again that legislation be enacted making available produc tion cut-over and unused land in the West. "Make rural life more attractive, and production greater," he said. He included recommendations for the de velopment of various resources and the continued building of good roads. 1EST

The industrial life of the Middle W.est was slowly but surely being stilled today by tHB coal shortage. The resumption of war-time restric tions of coal consumption went into effect today.

Brown, business manager of the University, expects to ijit enough to last another week. Further than that there is no assur ance that-the University will secure a supply sufficient to finish this term. The city schools are wholly de pendent upon the local dealers for coal, as they have no surplus and are getting their fuel in small lQts from the dealers with whem the schools have contracts to supply coal through the winter. Ir the dealer? should be come unable to fill their contracts the schools would have no othpr source ot supply. Commercial Club members, however, believe there' will be no trouble exiparienced in securing enough tfuel to keep the city schools open. 3Icy Call for Volunteer Miners.
