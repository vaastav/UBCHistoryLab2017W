GOOD t3. A. B. WORK. The people of this city .aro much pkased with Col. V. M. Sterritt, who is heru us o.vecutivp head of the manage meat and programino of the National Encampment of tho Grand Army of tho Republic. He has chargo of all the ar rangements from the boginning to tho close of tho oncanvpment, as well as of all tho preliminary preparations. Col onel Storrctt has established headquar ters in the Commercial club building, and cjrprcssos himself as delighted with this city and its inhabitants. All who havo met Colonel Storrott reciprocate that feeling of good will and ploasuro in meeting him, and there is little doubt but he will find his way smoothed hero in every possible manner. j " Colonel Stcrret.t ia thoroughly efficient j in this work. Ho is experienced in it, j and is countod tho best, administrative man who over occupied that position. Ho conducted tho Grand Army encamp ment at Saratoga in 1007 and tho ono at Toledo m 100S, making gTeat suc cesses of each, jast 113 he will make a splendid succoss of tho encampment in Salt Lake. Ho is now awaiting with tho greatest possible interest, the ar rival of tho commander-inchief of the Grand Army, General Nevius, who will arrive on Monday next with his staff, comprising altogether, with the ladies accompanying the party, some twenty people. This party will bo welcomed with the utmost hospitality and enthu siasm in Salt Lako City. Tho Graud Army officials will be banqueted at tho Commercial club on Tuesday evening, tho oocasion being the annual banquet of the club, and the effort will be to make it tho greatest function in the history of tho club in honor of theso official visitors of the Grand Army who represent it, as well as a prido to tho 'club on the coming of these distin guished visitors to our city. It is conceded that this place is amply ablo to take care of all. Tho first at tention, of course, will be given to the old soldiers themselves. Then, without doubt, ovcr3' other person in attend ance can be well taken care of also. Provo and Ogdcn have proffered to do thoir part also, in entertaining tho vet erans. Special trains to aud from those points, stopping at intermediate settle ments which will also doubtless bo proud to participato in entertaining the old veterans, will bo run daily, so that the members of tho Graud Army can seo theso valleys, speeding tho nights at such places as they desire outside, in case they desire to go outside at all, and will get back iu plenty of time to tako part in the proceedings of the day. Naturally the Grand Array veterans resident here aro ufiug thoir ut most ' endeavors to mako every thing pass off pleasantly, and they will devote themselves from now on. until the end of the encamnmcut to prepare everything to tho utmost limit of good sorvicc, and will keep itj up until tho encampment ends. Tho Commercial Club is taking prido in ar ranging for the bauquet for the En campment officers, and in doing every thing that is possible to mako it pleas ant for all concerned. It is also an effort iu which tho whole community is as one, and all will vie with each other to make it pleasant and comfortable for the -veteran?. Tho County Commissioners and the City Council joined jn the invitation to have the Grand Army encampment held here next August. All the political parties pledged themselves in their plat forms during tho recent campaign- to liberal appropriations from tho Legis lature, in aid of tho encampment, so that both from tho standpoint of hos pitality and from tho standpoint of the wherewithal to pay the expenses, the pledges already made, coupled with tho generosity of tho business men and of the pnblic of Salt Lake, is assured the providing of . ftvery facility and acces sory to mako this cucampmout one of tho finest ever hold in the history of tho Graud Army As stated by Colonel- Sterritt, tho veterans are dying off ranidlj, and those who aro not dying are getting so far along in years that it caunot be ex pected that many more National En campments will be held. But this one is. to be held, and is to be held in Salt Lake. And tho thing to do is to mako it tho most meraorablo of all; and we .believe that tho man in chargo has the power to bring this about, with tho co-opcratiou of every local force, all of which will bo available at. his commaud to serve him and tho cause to tho up most of their..ability. It will bo a great thiug for Salt Lako, to have litis en campment a triumphant success; and that is precisely what, with Colonel Storritt's experience and able guidance we are all determined to make it. i - THE 

CAMBRIAN OFFICIALS. We notice that the Cambrian asso ciation here -have re-elected their old officers and oxecutivo staff to serve another term; and The Tribune Biuccro-l3- congratulates these gentlemen upon this deserved compliment and the recog nition of their earnest of forts thus ox pressed. Tho Cambrian association is sponsor for tho Eisteddfod, an institution that ba& grown to be one of tho permanencies of this country. In promoting the growth of. tho Eisteddfod to its present proportions and recognized value as a j potent publio educator, many difficul ties have becu encountered; but tho gcutlcincu who have had charge of ox ecutivo duties iji behalf of the Cambrian afeociation have met these obstacles with admirable courage, and have over come them to the .immense heuefit of the -community, Tho last session of the Eisteddfod, which was held in this city, was the most successful and far-reach- ing of any since tho Institution was established in this country. Credit for this fact must bo. awarded to tho of ficials who had the matter in charge, aud who have just boon roturned to their posts of honor. Theso gentlemen ore well worthy of tho appreciation thus shown to them: and Tho Tribuno be speaks for their further efforts tho ample reward of splendid success, which we feel they value above all else in con nection with their activities. , GET 

FIRST BLOOD. Tho citizons who havo sued for an injunction against the establishment of tho proposed "red-light" district as proposed on tho west sido, have drawn first blood, and plenty of it. The suit was for a temporari' injunction, with a view to making it permanent, on due hear ing, to provout the establishment of such a district on tho sito pro posed. Tho Citizens' Investment Com pany, undor whoso auspices this district is being established, demurred to tho issue of the injunction, and tho court overrules that demurrer. This is a distinct and gratifying suc cess for the cause of law and good or der. It affirms in positivo and legal form tho conclusion which tho Ameri can party and The Tribuno have all along been contending for. It is a strong and gratifying evidence that civio virtue is not dead, and that tho community has tho right and tho means to protect itself from tho sort of in fection or contagion that is proposed, as well as from that involved in other forms. The Tribuno is unfeiguedly glad of this ruling by tho court, aud hopes for a permanent ruling to tho samo effect. POLITICS AND PARTIALITY. It appears curious to see that the Smoot "louth" still fights shy of tho proposition that the peoplo suspect the motives of Sheriff Emory in his pre tended fight for purity and against the red-light district. Thore has never been any doubt in the public mind that Sher iff Eme-'s action in this was political, personal, underhand, and uttorly in sincere and deceptive. Tho effoct of his action has been to scatter around town with more or less wide dispersion, the outcast clas3 who wero inmates of places on Commercial street aud else where iu the underworld region, that wero owned by non-Mormons. There is no record that we know of anywhere, no instance has ever been cited, where Sheriff Emery routed from Commercial street, or from any other of the local ities of vice and crime, the denizens who resided iu houses owned by Mor mons. This has been frequently stated, both publicly and privately, and no dispute or denial has been mado of this partiality on tho part of Sheriff Emery. Now, what is .tho result of that one sided activity, dcvelopod for political purposes before election, 'of Sheriff Emery? Thcro can bo no two ways, to look at it. That activity was di-'' rected specifically and energetically in favor of the red-light district which a State incorproated company is endeavor ing to put in ou tho West Side of this city. The matter is as plain as any thing can possibly be to any oue who chooses to look at it. Emery invades these localities of vice and enrno, routs some of tho inmates out, and they dis perse throughout tho city. Wherever they go and settle there is an immediate outcry, and a demand for their ex pulsion. They aro expelled. No locality' is ready to receive them, no places are constructed with a view to the business they conduct, save only tho construction authorized by tho Slato under1 its incor poration, of the company that is con structing the cribs and vilo dens in that So-called red-light district. Is it not "plain as a pikestaff" that the ultimate resort for those scattered pariahs will bo that red-light district? It seems impossible that Sheriff Emery could not have had this in view when he made his raids and dispersed tho in mates of tho non-Mormon owned houses of ill-repute. He certainly is a man of Eomc practical experience and of a little knowledge at least of vice and crime, and he must havo known that this would be tho suro outcomo of the raids that he began and pursued. No whero else iu the city could they bo harbored or find refuge except in that red-light district, aud tho Emery raids will inevitably force them to go there, while he pretends the contraiy. The Sheriff began this work prior to election, and conducted it in such a conspicuous, raw, and partial manner that every one could see the motive be hind the act. It is a clear case, there fore, that Sheriff Emrry was not only "playing politics," which the "Mouth " denies in his behalf, but that he was also playing fa.vorites as be tween the douizons of Mormon owned and non-Mormon owned properties. Even up to now, as we are informed, no women of ill-repute aro disturbed who will live in property owned by prominent Mormons or by estates of prominent Mormons. "They aro securo from all interference by Sheriff Emery. Ho routs out tho women of ill-roputo who liyo in the non-Mormon owned houses, however, and ultimately they must drift to tho rod-light district, be cause they are undesirable as neighbors anywhere else, and everywhere else that they go they will be routed out and mado to leave. The game is a per fectly clear one as it has developed, and as u man is presumed to know what he ia doing and to do -what bo in tends to do, the conclusion is irresistible that Sheriff Emery is working for the peopling of the red-light district with the objectionable class of tho popula tion which he pretends such anxiety to drive out of town. As stated, ho is not only "playiuK polities," he is playing favorites. Tho public of tho city is absolutely convinced of the bad faifr I of Sheriff Emory iu this matter, and it does not believe in the least in anj protestations that ho may mako of wiP ; bigness to serve tho cause of purit and tho right enforcement of tho Iut DEMOCRATIC F0SSD3IL1TD3S. Wc aro reminded by an articlo in the current Forum ot" the fact that tbo ac cent elcctiop, which was finch an over whelming defeat for Bryan, was not such a blow to' tho Democratic party us appeared ou tho surlacc. Mr. Bryan is reported as haviug recoivo-1 tho elec toral votes o tho Stafos of Alabama 11, Arkansas 0, Colorado 0, Florida 5, Georgia 13, Kentucky 13, Louisiana 0, I Mississippi 10, Nebraska 8, Nevada 3, North Carolina 12, Okla'ioma 7, South Carolina f), Tennessee 12, Toxns 18, Vir ginia 12; a total of IoG. Besides this lie carried a portion of tho electoral vote of Maryland, say six out of tho eight. That would givo him 1G2 votes. But thero wore other Statu that the Democracy did not altogether lose; for tho. Democratic candidates for Governor in Ohio, Indiana, North Dakota, and Minnesota wore elected. But usually the Presidential o.nmUdate is tho strong est man on tho tickot, so that ono would naturally expect in anv State whero a Republican Governor was elect ed that tho Republican iaudidate for Pre&ident would carry by s. greater ma jority than tho candidate for Gover nor received, and this was generally tho I case. Tn tho samo way tho natural I expectation is that whcie a -Democratic ! Governor is elected the Democratic Presidential nominco will carry the State by even a heavier vote. Lot us suppose, say, that Johnson, clocted Govornor of Minnesota, had boon the Democratic candidato for President. It is altogothcr likely that ho would havo carried tho States of Ohio. Indiaua, North Dakota, and Minnesota, whore Democratic Governors wero olectod, (himself in Minnesota,) but where Taft received the electoral vote of the States. A Democratic candidate for President carrying those States would havo added lifty-thrcc electoral votes to tho number above enumerated for Bryan, and one could hardly Luiag'ino any Democratic candidato not carrying all of those States. It is probable also that a strong Democratic candidate for President, let us say Johnson of Minnesota again, would have carried the full eight elec toral votes of Marylaud, and also those of 'Missouri, IS. Ou this suppositious basis, the Democratic candidate for Frcsideut would havo roccived 235 elec toral votes. But as the -number ueces sary to olect is 242, it is seen that the Democracy had a fair chance tp make an oxccodiugl3' close election, provided thoy had nominated Johnson or some ono not so conspicuously weak as- Mr. Bryan. The Forum points out that thcro wero many things apnaront in the campaign to the advan'tago of the Democratic party and to tho disadvantage of tho Republican party. Among those it enu merates the. internal dissensions in tho Republican organization iu several States, the alignment of organized-labor for Bryan, llic dissatisfaction among the negroes, tho effect of the panic on tho commercial world, which caused widespread idleness and discontent. The Forum concludes that "it. is no won der, therefore, that even upou tho evo of election Mr. Bryan uttered a confi dent prediction as to tho outcome." And wo add that a good many others wero fully of Mr, Brj'an's opinion as to the otucomc for Democratic success. Bf tho abovo reckoning, it will be seen that t hose who considered such out look to be good wero not necessarily wrong in thoir judgment. They wero wrong only on the point that, contrary to their expectations, Mr. Bryau could not cany the Democratic vote. 

"WHEN THE DEVril WAS SICK." The Lord either was not with us or was on a vacation. Now I know my faith was wrong, thai I was mistaken. "Auam God" Sharp at Kansas City, Mo. It appears, howovor, that this con victiou of tho error of his way did not occur to the fanatical Sharp until he ran afoul of tho law, with fatal conse quences to his deceived followers. And in this respect there is a significant re semblance in his caso to that which has been presented by the other false prophets and their followers kere in TJtah. Sharp was defiant and deter mined to put his nonsensical ideas into practice, but was eventually convinced that he was in the wroug but not, mind you, until tho law forced tho conviction and tho acknowledgment of its exis tence. Here in TJtah tho false prophets were at one time irrevocably committod to tho establishment of polygamy as a permanent social institution iu this community. In fact the open introducer of plural marriage, Prophet Brighani Young, boasted that tho Mormon church would "force polygamy down tho throats of tho peoplo of tho United States, whether they wanted it or not.'' There was continuous defiance of the National Government to this end. Tho resources of tho people and the public revenues of tho Territory wero largely expended in subverting and de feating tho purpose of tho National statutes with respect to the marriago rolation. This continued until public sc-ntiment-throughout the country was aroused to such a pitch as to demand tho enactment and enforcement of laws that would havo the effect of stamping ont the polygamous evil and crushing the promoters of this barbarism. Upon prac tical complianco with this demand the fnlso prophets of Utah saw their error. Their followers wero mado to suffer be cause of tho insolent and lawless deter mination of the leaders to thrust their lecherous practices into public recogni tion Meinoers of the Mormon church wore sent to prison-on account of it; and while here and thero a prominent high priest official suffered with them, the bullv of the woe fell upon tho mass. And it was not until this condition de- veloped that the leaders decided that thoy had changed their minds; that thojr faith was wrong; that thoy wero mistaken. Now, thor could bo no bettor paral lel adduced than is found in tho present attitude of this "Adnm-God" Sharp and that once taken by our local false prophets. Sharp was blatant aud de fiant up to tho time that tho officers of tho law determined to tako a hand in his case. Doul.bless he would havo gone on in his wild and senseless career, provided ho could havo escaped injury and capture, declaring that it was tho purpose of tho Lord to inflict woe upon his followers in order to try thorn, just as has been repeatedly asserted by the Mormon prophetic fanatics. Tho nio ment, however, that ho personally re ceived his wounds he was roady to capitulate, just as did tho Mormon po lygamisls. But, precisely as was tho caso locallj, tho follpwors suffered most, because in some of thoir cases the re sults wero fatal. In connection with this matter a dis patch was sout out from Butte, Mon tana, to tho effect that Shai-p had been in that city, advocating his doctrines. Perhaps in this fact may bo found an explanation of his possession of the non sensical beliefs professed by him. In the main they aro identical with somo of those entertained by ,tho Mormon prophets and Montana is not so far away from Utah that Sharp could not probably have boon hero at some time. But even if ho had not visited here, it is not altogether unreasonable to assume that ho had heard somo Mormon elder preach elsewhere upon subjects kindred to the ideas which ho has been ad vancing in "Kansas City. In any event, it can but bo concluded that Sharp is a mero copyist of Mormonism until more can be known of his doctrines; and in tho meantime wo aro entitled to in dulgo in tho suspicion that he is not at all original on account of the marked similarity botweon his known views aud those of the Mormon priesthood. Judging from the expressions of Sharp since his arrest, it would appoar that he is now convinced that it is bol ter to be good and to drop his insane ideas this while he is in jail; but thore is no tolling what he wotuld do if per mitted to have his freedom, again. While consequences of thoir crimes were laid upon the Mormon lawbreakers thoy camo to a similar conclusion and gave liko promise to reform; but tho moment that tho pressure was relioved on ac count of thoso pledges, and they achieved their mastery, under State hood, they broke loose again. So that' experience with false prophets here would suggest that the man Sharp should be delaiued either in prison or in a madhouse during tho remainder of his life. And this samo experience teaches that in all likelihood this State would now be ufinitoly bettor off had similar treatment been accorded to tho spurious, law-defying, law-breaking, and fanatical prophets of Mormonism. 

BUSINESS AND TRADE. Tho formation of the Utah Develop mcut Lcaguo by a convention of delo gntes from different parts of the State, held at tho Commercial club - rooms in this city on Thursday and Friday last, is the most recent and it may turn out the most important business occurrence- of the past week. That con vention indulged in sonic lively talk, as was quite proper, on independent lines, but on one point all were agreed, aud that was that the best possible efforts should be" nladc for tho dclcvopment and upbuilding of tho Slate. Some politics crept in, as in tho discussion of tbo alleged Des Moines form of gov ernment, but in tho main business and "economics occupied tho attention of the convention. Thero is to be another session of this Utah- Development League in this city next month, in which matters will probably take more concrete form than in the preliminary session just held. The resolution and declarations of purposes aro in the main commendable, aud afford ample working basis for tho league to get busy upon. The traffic bureau of tho Commercial club continues its activity in agitat ing for better freight rates for Salt Lake City. The apparent reply of tho railroads to this agitation, which ap pears to look to tho yet further op pression of the business publie, cau uot be accepted by the freight bureau as anything but a vicious slap in tho faccto those who wish to obtain justico for this city. Thcro is no possible reason that wo can see why the rail road companies should not givo Salt Lake City at least an equal freight rato w'ith that which Spokauo enjoys; Spokano and this city being practically tho samo distance from the east and west coasts, taking it on tho general averago and measurement. It appears to bo an absolutely clear caso that if tho railroads can afford to carry freights to Spokane at a very much reduced rate as compared with the rate now prevailing here, they can also af ford to ship to Salt Lake at tho Spo kane iratos. The general business conditions in this city are on qnite a satisfactory basis. Trade is strong, tho markets and merchants' supplies are in great profusion, and offer a woudcrful va riety of choice, tfho trading is vigorous, as is. to be expected at the opening of the holiday time, and thoso who serve the public arc on the jump to meet tho demands, Tho increase of population in this city, as is evidenced from tho immediate occupation of tho hundiods of now buildings put. up dur ing tho year just closing, adds to the demand very materially. And in gen eral tho business transactions are on an expanded scale, v Tho bank clearances of this city for tho past week, as compared with tho corresponding week last year, show an increase of 116.S per cent; that is, those clearances havo considerably moro than doublod. Last year, to bo sure, tho clearances were abnormally low by reason of the currency depression which was then pinching tho country. But making duo allowance for that, it is evident that thero has been a substan tial growth in the normal clearances in this city during tho year. The building operations, which came almost to a standstill during tho heavy storm, havo boen resumed in fair de gree since, and thero is now an unusual activity in and extent of building for this season of the year. Tho building operations havo taken an exceedingly wide range, including the great Nqw housc skyscrapers, the big sovon-siory Railroad Exchange constructed by Mrs. Judge, tho Oregon Short Line union depot, the beginning of the Rio Grnndo Western depot, warehouses, business blocks, and, above all, dwelling places ranging from fiats, apartment houses and mansions to the modest cottage fit for the small family. All of these have been occupied immediately upon their completion, and still thcro aro no empty houses in town, and very fow torn down, All of which proves not only tho great increase in population, but also tho very material and gratifying . increase in business facilities and ca pacity. Tho real estate dealings show well for tho wook, property being firmly heldt and yet at pricos not excessive, so that any ono is suro of good profits in investing in Salt Lake roalty. This is. to bo ono of the great cities of the interior of tho United States, and those owning property here cannot possibly loso on it, but arc suto to gain. Tho mining industry is rapidly as suming its natural pre-eminence aud overwhelming importation. The mag nificent report on the Silver King by Mr. MacVichie, tho great oxport, made public in Tho Tribune on Wednesday morning, showed resources iu wealth in that tremendous property excelling even the most sanguine oxpcctatious.'j Mr. MacVichie evidently considers this property ono of tho very greatest of bonanzas. The determination to con struct tho Utah Con. smelter, which will do custom work also and be virtually an independent plant for the handling 0 custom ores, is one of tho great events of tho latter part of tho year. Tho completion of that plant will al most necessitate the building of the 1 great tunnel through the Oquirrh range to give direct access from the mines I at Bingham to Tooele valley. This has boon ono of the dreams of the years for thoso on the west side of the range, and it looks now more than ever as if thnt tunnel, so long a mero specu lation, must be, mado a practical fact. The data, compiling on tho mining in dustry of Utah to bo used iu The Tribune annual will probably show re sults practically equal to thoso of last 3rear, when the metal product was given at upwards of $ol,Q00,0Q0. Tho railroad event of the week was tho opening of a further extent of the Western Pacific to traffic. That lino now nips regularly to Wells, Nevada, and thus affords acocfrs to a largo and rich area south of tho Southern Pacific line, au1 which the Western Pacific will do much to develop and assist. Next year this line is to be finished through to San Francisco from this city, accord ing to official announcement, and wc doc not doubt but that the time will earn the fact with it. Wo expect also next year to see something important achieved that will mako a showing for Utah on tho Moffat line, which is plannod and party constructed between Denver and this city. f The past year hasbecn a magnificent ono for Utah farmers and stock raisers. The very heavy snows that have al ready1 fallen, making great deposits in tho hills, nss'ure also a good agricul tural season next year for this State. 1 In the country at large the bank clearances for tho past week show a vast phenomenal increase over those of the corresponding week the year "be fore, as was noted formerly in the treating of these clearings. But, as heretofore stated, last 3'ear was a j-ear of such abnormal depression that a di rect comparison between the two years doos not toll a fair story. In order to get a proper comparison, the figures of 190G and 1003 also havo to bo con sidered. And taking theso for the coun try at largo, thus far the account shows that tho present year is below what the natural growth of tho country would lend ono to expect. But in Salt Lako it is just the reverse Wo have here a substantial and healthy increase, taking all of the. years together. The commercial agencies report that retail and holiday trade show expanded busi ness, although in certain sections, es pecially in tho South, whero low priced cotton cramps tho buying power of the people, thero is not the ac tivity that was expected. Tho .whole sale and jobbing trade is rather quiet, becauso the spring orders aro in a moasuro filled, and the trade is wait ing for developments and for reorders. Manufacturing operations continuo in good volume, and thero is a constant addiiion to tho starting up of ma chinery that, has for months been id-ie. The building permits he country over show good gains, and mercantile collec tions aro moro prompt. Tho financial world is surprised by gold engagements for shipment to France amounting to between live and six million dollars thus far, and the, reports sem puzzled as to the cause. Tho Tribune undoubtedly was right in its judgment, expressed Thursday morn ing, that tho reason for theso gold ex ports to France is that Franco has boon unloading very heavily her Ameri can securities of all kinds; partly bo caause of the developments during the currency depression which showed such alarming shrinkago in the 'vfl thoso securities, aud partly,' juK5 political or economic roasonawp own; ono suggestion being tha-sS strengthening herself for a poniXw and another that sho is aceunC the gold to tako the Russian mWt -5300,000,000, which is expected offered early in tho new year.
