The importance of those islands is apparent, and the need of improving their condition and developing their resources is urgent. ' Our Currency System is imperfect. 1 During the seven years and three months there has been a net surplus of nearly o-ic hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the interest-bearing debt of ninety millions. I believe it is worse than' folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations, as is done by the Sherman anti-trust law. a. Under such a popular government as our, founded on the theory that in the long run the will of the people is su preme, the safety of the Nation can only rest in training and guiding the people so that what they will shall be right and not in devising means to defeat their will by the tech nicalities of strained construction. What would have been an infringement on liberty half a century ago may be. the ncctssary safeguard of liberty to day. ' . The pconlc should not be allowed to pardon evil and slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right. We must face the fact that there are wise and unwise judges, just as there arc wise and unwise executives and legislators. In this respect compensation for families of injured the generosity of the United States toward its 'employees compares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe even the poorest. , No man should be allowed to make money in connec tion with railroads out of fraudulent overcapitalization and kindred stock-gambling performances. We do not object to the concentration of wealth and administration: but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration. tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt n tt tt tt tttt tt tt tt tt tt tt a tt-ft tt tt a a tt a tt tt a tt a tt a a a a a aa a a tt a a a a a t: tt a tt a a a n a a a a tt tt a a it a a a ( a a a tt a a a tt a a a a a a - a a a tt a a a tt a a a a a a a tt a a tt a a a a tt tt a a tt a a a a a a a a a a , a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a tt 'tt tt a a tt a aaa naa REMEMBER THIS Wc will take charge of your Christ mas parcels, large or small, and de liver them when you request.
