Refuse to know party lines. If one political party espouses local option as a party measure, just so soon you drive the other political party against local option Keep local option out of the political arena,"and we endorse what was then said by our grand chief templar in his ad? dress to the legislature and the peo? ple of Virginia. "Gentlemen: The Good Templars of this state have done all in their power to keep this question out of party politics, and they have an abiding faith that all future enact? ments of your honorable body will be of such a character as will keep it where it now is?out of party politics, for if any adverse legislation on this question should occur, then it tuters parry polities anil conies to stay until it is settled and settled right. "Having passed the local option law, which virtually takes this ques tion out of party politics, it is with feelings of profound respect riint we tender to you our hear Melt thanks? giving for your wise, timely ami ju>r legislation on the great question." job Hawxhurst, J.

Myers, of Gordonsville, cashier of the Piedmont bank, aud another gentleman are at ti e head of the enterprise, an*1 will doubtless make it a success. There is not a bank in Alleghany county, and this enterprise will meet with the appro? bation of all our business men, as they are now obliged to deposit their cash in the banks of Staunton. On the 35th of last month a decree was entered in the chancery case in? volving the sale of the Warm Springs property, in Hath county, which had been removed to the Augusta court from Hath. The sale was confirmed to M. E. Ingdlsand W. P. Anderson, who deposited a certified check for $24,500, which amount, was ordered to be placed in the Augusta National bank to the credit of tin? suit. This insures the building of the branch road from our county seat, Coving ton. to the springs. The road will probably be commenced early in the spring. i\ republican newspaper is to be started in this place before many days. A Mr. Gringer, of Covington, is the pioneer in the scheme. It is thought by men of experience that a paper With the right kind of politics would do a good business. Rev. J. F.

The Roanoke correspondent of the Alexandria Gazette, among other things, in a very interesting letter to that paper of December 3rd, says: The contract for a $13,000 Baptist church has just been awarded to Woltz Bros. The present house of worship owned by the Baptists comes far short of accommodating the con? gregation and the Sunday school. Rev. O. F. Flippo has just entered upon his fourth year as pastor of the church. Three years ago the church numbered 100 members; now the membership is over 300. The church has declared itself independent of tho State Mission board, and in addition has increased the pastors salary. Theatrical.

MESSAGE. HOW IT IS REGARDED BY PROMINENT MEN. THE PORTIONS OBJECTED TO. TIm Treatment orthcXcj;ro Question Condemned ?m V wise - UN View* on the Mcrciuint Marine Approved. By Associated Press. WASHINGTON, L). C December }. Now, tbat time has been given to read the president's message, the general opinion among lair-minded men is that it is an exceedingly weak docu? ment Tue local papers all publish comments about it and some of these are given below: Senator Vest, of Missouri: I did not hear it as 1 had some writing to do when it was read. It was terribly long: just what we might expect from Harrison. He strung out what he hail to say like a schoolmaster writing a composition. 1 will take it up some rainy day and look it through. Senator Call, of Florida: So far uh the negro portion of it is concerned, the president, 1 think, has made a very great error, ill's message is cal? culated to incite trouble among the negroes of the south. It is an incite? ment to arson, murder, and other crimes which are usually developed j among ignorant people. The princi- I pal crime among the negroes is rape, and 1 think that many white families of the south will have cause to fear the consequences of this message. The idea of giving jurisdiction to United States courts in elections is another error. The message will sow the seed of trouble, and will cause great harm. Judge Crisp, of Georgia, stated that the president had gone too far in his inessage, and both he and his party would discover it. and the last chair? man of the committee on elections expressed his opinions as to what course his party would pursue in the event elections legislation was at? tempted on the lines laid down by the president In the lir.-t place, said the judge,we will not oppose the creation of a special elections committee, nor will we endeavor to prevent any bill such a committee may report from going in its proper place on the calendar. We will resist the attempt to confer on such a special committee the privi? leges of the regular elections commit tee. which can demand consideration of it.-^ report at any time. Tin- messagedemonstrati a that it is to be the mu?r partisan administra? tion in the history of the country, said Representative Candler, of (Georgia. The language of this mes? sage is not the utterance of a wise statesmen, but of a narrow partisan demagogue. No such state of things exists as he assumes in any part of the south, and he certainly knows his utterances on the negro question are untrue. Mis object is purely partisan for the purpose of perpetuating the the power of the republican party. If the message is a reflection of the president's knowledge of the south, said Representative fate.-, of Ala? bama, it shows that he does not know anything i?boat that section. ;t looks, said Representative U'Fer rall,of Vhginia.as if Harrison's eulogy of the negro was lor the purpose of capturing the southern negro dele? gates to the national convention. Senator Far well: The only part of (he message to which 1 listened attentively was that relating to the merchant marine. 1 am very glad the president has called the attention of congress and ol the country to this great question. 1 think the people of the United Maies an read) and anx? ious to do what is right to restore things to their old basis. 1 have always favored the payment of increased postal appropriations, or subsidies, if you choose, to the mer? chant marine. 1 am gradually begin ning to favor the payment ot subsi? dies to all vessels engaged in the for? eign trade. Representative McCroary, of Ken? tucky, said: I did not hear much of the message. 1 was much plea?ed, though, with the president's refer? ence to the international American congress. I was the author of the bill under which that congress was called together, and 1 naturally feel a great interest in it. Representative Frank; I am pleased with the president's message. It covers many topics that I feared he would not touch upon. 1 am much gratified that he has given attention to commercial topics, such as the na? tional bankrupt law, the aiding of the merchant marine, and the world's fair project. Representative Outhwaitc: From what I cmld hear of the meesage it seems that it is obscure in regard to silver. This will be an important matter of legislation this winter, and the president does not seem to be in line with the majority of his party. Supreme Court of Appeals.

I'KOI'JKKTIES .SOLD In Allegbany and Kittli Conutie?, Vn atul in Webster County, W. Vn. The Richmond dispatch says: ??The mineral and forest lands in Alleghany and Bath counties, known as the 'Douthat Survey,' comprising 103,000 acres, were some time the matter of legal investigation. The boundary, commencing near Covington, extends along the valley of Jackson's and up the Cowpasture river above Fort Lewis?in all about thirty miles. The average width is four or live miles,the whole being on the east side of the Warm springs mountain. Within the boundary are several parcels of land not claimed by the beneficiaries in the property. Iron ores abound in all parts of the property and the chemical tests note some of tho yields as high as 58 per cent, of metalic iron. The forest and lumber resources of the property were investigated by Mr. A. P. Withrow, of Bath county, a genth man well informed and with much practical experience in such matters. His reports, he says, are under the amounts which can be realized, as follows: White oak lum? ber, 20,000.000 feet: chestnut oak, 4,000,000; white pine, 3,000,000; ehest nut, 2,000,000; black oak. 3,000,000; tan-bark, 45,000 cord--: railroad ties, 'Juo.ooo. This property was sold last week by the trustees, Messrs. S. T. Altern us and Mat hew Semple, of Philadelphia, to Mr. Peter McLaren, of Canada, lor $300,000. One hundred thousand whs paid in cash and the remainder to be paid in three equal annual instalments, bearing 1 per cent, interest. Mr. McLaren, the purchaser, is of the syndicate which bought some months ago the well known Ferial iron property on the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, about twenty miles we6t of Stauuton. The law firm of Sheffey& Bumgard ner, of this city, purchased some years ago a boundary of land in Webster county, West Virginia, containin 2,?oo acrts, for which they paid (Jo cents per acre. On the 1st instant Captain James Bumgardner. surviv ing partner, sold if to Mr. 0. P. Door of Webster county, for ?3 per acre half cash, balance in one year fro date of sale. The lands in that section of West Virginia remote from transportation lines are now becoming more valuable as railroads ?re projected. Of this class the Virginia and Pittsbnrg rail road scheme is revived and its route is along the lines which are in the course of construction. This scheme is a favorite one in the plans of the Rockbridge company and the pro posed manufacturing city of Glasgow in that county.' i he sales of the two propertie above mentioned had no connection but the law linn of Shelley A Bum Gardner, owners in one case and at torneys in the other, realized hand poniely. Captain Bumgardner, the surviving partner, than whom there is no man in all this country more universally esteemed, has been con gratulated by hosts of friends for the sale be made in Webster county, and because of the I realization of the rc t lining lee for his firm in the Douthat lands, which amounts, according* to the share it. bears to the whole, to about $ 10.000.v Crniff Wins.
