The value of railroads to the countTy, however, must not bo lost sight of. and while it may be desir able to curb their "vaulting ambi tion," there should be a care that iheir enterprise should not be dis turbed by oppressive measures that will be of little value to the country and only serve to harass railroad bur-mess. If is. however, hard To discern any justice rr necessity for further donations cf pub'ic lands to railroad corporations; in fact there is neither while hundreds of thou sands of citizens of tho United S.'Ktes go unlinded that would, in the course of time, under the govern ment, become land owners and thereby producers. But double the price of lands, as the railroad com panies have invariably doae, and a large clasB of people is cut off from becoming producers. If railroad companies were con fined to the government price in dis posing of lands, there miglit not be so much objection to their assistance when they needed it. Rtiilroads should have no more favors from the government than is given to the private individual, nor 60 much.

It is good enough, for Mur ray or Talmage and othsr howling politicians, but indicates that the prsid:it has lost his head in his madonslauht on Mormons and letting himself be made a tool of by Gov Murray. We do not believe congress can b coerced and duped into ha3ty and foolish action, as the president has been. The News, the official organ of the chureh, says: The utterances will occasion much surprise. It 13 to raie an issue to figure in a coming presidential election. The reasons given by the president, are extremely weak, and do not add to the force of the message nor do credit to his sup posed sagacity and statesmanship, and certiinly create no commotion among the peaceable aud God-fearing people of Utah.

Throe years ago Kobert Peacock, a married rain of Oakland, Cal., was arrested, charged with felonious arsault on E iith Martin, as 8 year old child. He was convicted and sentenced to San Quentin for 14 years. Mrs. Mai tin, mother of the girl, now lying at death's door, has just confessed that the arrest and conviction cf Peacock was the result of a conspiracy be tween her, Mrs. Peacock, and a man named Cobb, and that Cobb is absos lutely innocent of the crime. Cobb was intimate with Peacock's wife. Mrs. Martin says she was induced to enter into the scheme by an oStr of money, and between them instructed tke youog child to make the charge and swear to it.
