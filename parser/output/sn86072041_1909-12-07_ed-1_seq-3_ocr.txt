PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE (Continued from Page Two.) trust and interstate commerce laws « which will be discussed in a separate j message. The president says the actual loss \ growing out of the transmission of , second class mail matter amounts to |, about $63,000,000 a year. Congress, , he says, may well consider whether j, radical steps should not be taken ton reduce the deficit by imposing a high-• j er rate on magazines and periodicals, j j President Taft says he is convinced \i the people desire for postal savings • < bank and that they would be produc- ; - live of the utmost good. He says of|« them: ''They will furnish a satis-[« factory substitute for the system of i' a government guaranty of deposits J' which, with deference to those who;' advocate it, seems to me to have in it,' the seeds of demoralization to Con-P servative banking and certain finan cial disaster." The president earnestly recom- \ mends the passage of a ship subsidy bill. In recommending separate state-N bood for New Mexico and Arizona,; \ the president advises that after the.J adoption of a constitution if be sub- J a mitted to the people for approval.j« State officers should not be elected ' j until the constitution has been voted 1 upon. j "With respect to Alaska." said the j president, "I recomend legislation;! which shall provide for the appoint- \ ment by the president of a governor j 4 and also of an executive council, the j members of which shall, during their: j term of office, reside in the territory, j j and which shall have legislative now- j era sufficient to enable it to give the! j territory local laws adapted to ;, s|| present growth. I strongly deprecate jl legislation looking to the election of i j a territorial legislature in that vast!j district." 1 \ The president mentions the neces-li sity for legislation looking to thell further conservation of natural re-|< sources and announces that a special!J message on the subject, including that • of waterways, reclamation, irrigation,l l reforesting, etc.. will be sent to con-M gress early. Transfer of control over j i the lighthouse to a suitable civilian \ j bureau is recommended because ofij frequent friction due to the absence' \ of any central independent authority, j j "White slavery" is discussed, the 1 1 view being that there is urgent neces- j 1 sity for additional legislation andj] greater executive power to suppress II j. 1 believe It to be constitutional. M 11 the president says, * to forbid, under M penalty, the transportation of per- f \ sons for purposes of across national and state lines; and] \ by appropriating a fund of $30,000 to ! be used by the secretary of commerce j . ;ind labor for the employment of < special inspectors, it will be possible to bring those responsible for this trade to indictment and conviction,; j under a federal law." j The president says that while the J medical departments of the armyfi and navy must be kept separate, there ] i seems to be no reason why all th" [J other bureaus and officers in the gen-j< eral government which have to doli with the public health should not be « united in a bureau to be called the j' "Bureau of Public Health." In conclusion, the president says: ' "Speaking generally, the country ' is in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantia] business expansion and we have just garner ed a harvest unexampled in the mar-1 ket value of our agricultural pro- j ducts. "The high prices which products bring, mean great prosperity for the farming community, but on the other hand, they mean a very considerably increased burden upon those classes in the community whose yearly com-| pensation does not expand with thei improvement in business and the gen-j eral prosperity. Various reasons ate! given for the high prices. The pro portionate increase in the output of gold which today is the chief medium of exchange and is in some respects a measure of values, furnishes a sub stantial explanation of at least part of the increase in prices. The increase in population and more expensive j mode of living of the people, which have not been accompanied by a pro portionate increase in acreage pro duction, may furnish a further rea son. It is well to note that the in crease in the cost of living is not con fined to this country, but prevails thei world over and that those who would! charge increase in prices to the exist-1 ing protective tariff must meet the' fact that the rise in prices has taken place almost wholly in those pro ducts of the factory and farm in re spect to which there has been neither no increase in the tariff or in many instances a very considerable reduc tion."
