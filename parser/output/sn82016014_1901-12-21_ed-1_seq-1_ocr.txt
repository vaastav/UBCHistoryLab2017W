16 PAGES ffl in LAST EDITION. SATURDAY EVEXING. TOPEKA, KANSAS, DECEMBER 21, 1901. SATURDAY EVENING. THREE CENTS. jjj POLITICAL GOSSIP Onlj 40 Candidates in Field For State Officers. JBnt Then There Are 13 More Who Are Willing. SEVENTH IN THE LEAD. Eight Aspirants From That Section of State. Chairman Albaugh Comments on Leland Tnrn Down. There are up to date forty active candidates for the fourteen places on the Republican ticket, and thirteen more who are listed as possibilities. All of those counted as active candidates have not formally "announced," but they are at work with that end in view. Of the active candidates there are five In the First congressional district, four in the Second, three in the Third, four in the Fourth, three in the Fifth, three in the SiKth, and eight in the Seventh. Of the "possibles" five are in the First, one in the Second, one in the Third, none in the Fourth, three in the Fifth, two in the Sixth and one in the Seventh. If the candidates are divided equally between the districts, each district will have two places on the state ticket. It is quite probable, however, that some districts will get more, and therefore others will have to take less. It is pretty generally conceded that the Sec ond will get its quota all right, be cause it has two candidates to whom nominations are practically conceded:"! lorn Kelly, of Paola, for state treas urer, and C. F. Scott, of Iola, for con gress man-at-large. Here is the list of candidates by dis tricts: First district Troutman, of Shawnee, for governor; Ross, of Jefferson, for superintendent of schools; Welch, Slonecker and McFarland, of Shawnee, for associate justice. Possibilities, Bailey, of Nemaha, and Seaton of Atchison, for governor; Kelsey, of Atchison, for attorney general; In gal Is, of Atchison, for insurance superintend ent; MacDonald, of Shawnee, for school superintendent. Second district West of "Wyandotte for attorney general, Kelly of Miami for state treasurer, Cormany of Bour bon for lieutenant governor, Scott of Allen for congressman-at-large. Possi bilities, Ridgeway of Franklin for in surance superintendent. Third district Cole of Crawford for governor. Wells of Neosho for auditor. Pollock of Cowley for associate justice. Possibilities, Blue of Cherokee for at torney general. Fourth district Miller of Osage and Richter of Morris for governor, Harri3 of Lyon for secretary of state, Cun ningham of Lyon for associate justice. Fifth district Wilson of Republic for auditor, Coleman of Clay for attorney general, Osborn of Saline for insurance superintendent. Possibilities, Morrow of Washington for governor. Caldwell of Cloud for attorney general, Kimball of Saline for lieutenant governor. Sixth district Burrow of Smith for secretary of state, Hanna of Graham for lieutenant governor.Ellis of Mitchell for associate justice. Possibilities, Wil son of Ellis and Knight of Sherman for secretary of state. Seventh district Bone of Clark and McCullough of Harper for attorney general, Luling of Sedgwick for insur ance superintendent. Glenn of Greeley for lieutenant governor, Nelson of Me- .h-nerson and Dayhoff of Renor for school superintendent, Greene of Har vey and Mason of Finney for associate Justice. Possibilities, Kendrick of Har (4vey for acno1 superintendent. One of the best places in the state house is on the board of railroad com missioners. There is not very much work and the pay is $2,500 a year. One member is elected each year on or be ' fore the first day of April by the ex ecutive council. The member whose term expires the coming spring is D. "W. Finney, but from present appear ances he will be re-elected without op position. When he was first elected for the short term last spring it was re ported that State Auditor Cole would resign his present place next spring to be elected to the railroad commission, but Mr. Cole will make the race for governor instead. No other candidate has yet appeared against Governor Fjnney and it looks as though he will be re-elected for another three years. Among the leading Republicans who are most outspoken over the outcome of the contest over the pension agency con test, none are more so than Morton Al baugh. chairman of the state central committee. He reviews the contest in a double-column, large type editorial in his paper, the Kingman Courier. After paying a tribute -to Colonel Metcalf, he says: "The history of the present contest over this appointment, if written in full, would read like a romance. President , McKinley appointed Cyrus Leland, jr., agent in 1897. practically over the pro test of Senator Baker, because he knew him to be an honest, upright, capable gentleman, and because he had been his friend when h needed friends. Wheu Mr. Leland's term expired last July President MrKiniev tendered him n re appointment and he could have had it at that time, but Senator Burton, who "au oeen oppoeea to Mr. Leland and who had been making a fight against liia reappointment, when told by the president himself that Mr. Leland would be reappointed, went to Leland and per sonally requested that he, Mr. Leland, go to the president and ask him to de lay his reappointment until he, Mr. Bur ton, could have one or more of his rec ommendations acted upon favorably t Mr. Leland dil this. He did it at Mr. Burton's urgent request, accompanied with Mr. Burton's assurance that his fight upon him would cease. The presi dent complied with this request. Later when the president was at Canton and it seemed probable that one of Mr Burtons recommendations would be acted upon immediately. President Mc Kinley sent to the secretary of the in terior for Mr. Leland's commission. It was forwarded to him and was upon his desk at Canton when the fatal shot was fired from which the martyred pres ldent died. "Under these circumstances, with the sacredness that one would have thought .they were surrounded, the renewal of the fight of Senator Burton upon Mr Leland seems inexplicable. It is past ali nderstandinir. These are facts as told by Senator Burton himself to dozens of people In the time that intervened between Mr, Leland making this request and Presi dent McKinley's death, as told just after they occurred by President McKinley, as told by Mr. Leland as well." Deputy United States Marshal M coney of the Fort Scott district, is getting in a hurry for the appointment of a Unit ed States marshal so that he can be re lieved of his office. He says it has not paid him a living for some time, and he has been giving much of his time to his laundry business. The congressional contest in the Sixth district goes merrily on. Wellington is making hay while Congressman Reeder is attending congress, and he intimates that Reeder may now be the third man in the race. , Reeder, on the other hand, is getting many farmers on his side, because it looks as though he might ac complish something practical in the line of irrigation, wnich is his special hobby There is no doubt but Assistant State Treasurer T. T. Kelly will be ad vanced to first place in the office where he is now assistant, if the Republicans win next year. He is conceded the nomination for state treasurer. He is classified with the Burton faction, but he has been secretary of the state cen tral committee, and as such he has been perfectly fair with both sides, and there la no disposition to antagonize him. Senator W. A. Harris Is "shying" at the Doom which has been launched for him for the fusion nomination for gov ernor, and it is doubtful if he will stand for it. He would like to be returned to the senate, but he probably would not make a scramble for any other place. There are, by the way, many Kansas Republicans wno feel like the editor of the Effingham New Leaf did when he wrote the following: "While Senator Burton is looking after 'patronage,' Sen ator Harris is attending to his duties as a statesman. There are a lot of Kan sans who wish Senator Harris was in the Republican party." When Senator Burton gets around to some of the minor federal offices it is stated that he will name A. H. Blair, of WaKeeney, to be register of the Wa Keeney land office, and Otis L. Ather ton, of Russell, ex-state treasurer, to be receiver at the same office. Senator H. B. Miller is getting a good many good words from Kansas editors these days. Here is a sample from the Alma Enterprise: "To one on the out side, it certainly looks like Senator H. B. Miller, of Osage, is quite aways in the lead in the race for governor in the Fourth district. It would be mighty hard to find a better man." A number of the Fifth district papers are getting behind S. J. Osborn's boom for superintendent of insurance, but his nearest neighbor. Governor Riddle of the Minneapolis Messenger, is inclined to throw cold water on it. In com menting on Judge Osborn's- candidacy, Governor Riddle says: "At last the list is complete. Now that Judge Osborn is a candidate,for insurance commissioner, there are no more offices left, in Kan sas, for him to try for." Another Salina man who is having' nice things said about him is James A. Kimball, who has a boom for lieutenant governor, but who has not yet said he would run. A few days ago the Abilene Reflector gave his boom a boost and now the Lincoln Republican says: "One of the most sensible suggestions made in political circles lately was that of the name of James A. Kimball, of Salina, for lieutenant governor. The trouble is that Mr. Kimball is too busy a man to take such an office. The Holton Recorder springs an In cipient boom for. Tom McNeal for Unit ed States senator "provided ." It says: "Suppose there should be a deadlock in the legislature on the question of choos ing a United States senator. Suppose the vote should be so divided between Governor Stanley, Chester Long and Charles Curtis that neither could get a majority, even after the scattering had been corraled. What will be done? The Recorder isn't much In favor of a 'dark horse,' 'dark horses' as a rule are of mightly little account. They are gener ally men whose convictions are of such a makeup that they are everybody's friend, and really nobody can place much reliance on them. We have, how ever, in mind one man, who as a 'dark horse' would not embody in his make up these objectionable features. We allude to Tom McNeal. We would like to see Tom in the senate. He is a hu morist, it is true, but the kind of humor ist who would not in the least detract from the dignity that is supposed to charaeterizeand hedge about that august body. A number of men who achieved quite a reputation as funny men in the lower house have been promoted to the senate, and were scarcely heard of af terwards. They need a man in the sen-' ate of MeNeal's makeup. He would occasionally make them smile and pos sibly laugh, which would help their di gestion and give them an appetite. At the same time he would be able to give them some pointers In practical states manship which would be of great benefit to the country. Kansas has been rep resented in the Senate by Ingalls the orator. Plumb the politician. Peffer the crank. Baker the lawyer, and others wno aia not amount to much of any thing, but no Kansas humorist has ever been sent to Washington."

Teteran Editor and Kansas Pio- neer Dies in London. HIS EVENTFUL CAREER Left Kansas With the Hero of Harper's Ferry. Another Man Was Hanged For Him in Yirginia. London, Dec. 21. CoL Richard Josiah Hinton, the well known co-worker with John Brown, who served in the Union army 1861-'65, and later edited various newspapers in Washington, New York and San Francisco, died in London yes terday. He was born in London in 1820 and his home was in Brooklyn, 1 New York. CoL Hinton last visited Topeka in January, 1900, when he spoke before the . rt,' -co C( J)U 'Aj COL. RICHARD J. HINTON, "Who Died Friday in London. State Historical society and other or ganizations. He was a man of ability and hopes. He was the biographer of the life of Richard Realf, the first Kan sas poet, and he was responsible for the issuing of his poems in book form. When Col. Hinton was in Topeka last he had commenced the work of prepar ing "The John Brown Papers."The work was not finished. Col. Hinton to the last spent his time writing and by what he earned with his pen he and his wife lived in comfort at their home on Shore Road, Brooklyn. On account of his being compelled to spend his time in writing he was unabla to give his attention to the John Brown history, which was to have been com piled by himself and William Elsey Connelley, of Topeka. Mr. Connelley will endeavor to collect the valuable and unpublished John Brown papers that were in the possession of CoL Hinton and issue the book. CoL Hinton was the last of the John Brown provisional government formed at Chatham, Canada, before the Har per's Ferry raid. He was one of the few members of that govern ment who escaped with their lives. Col. Hinton fought in the first Cuban war for independence under Gen. Gomez and was wounded. The following is from the biography of Col. Hinton prepared by Mr. Con nelley and published in connection with Richard Realf's Free State poems: Richard J. Hinton was born in Lon don, England, November 26, 1830. His early life was one of hardship a strug gle for bread. He was brought up to labor, learning the stone-cutter's trade. But he was ever brave and sanguine; discouraging circumstances proved his greatest blessing, for they developed in him those sturdy qualities for which the Briton is so world-famous. Small of size, he was full of energy and ambi tion; while doing tne same work per formed by much larger boys, his labor was but half done when the shop closed, for he spent many hours poring over his books. By his own efforts he secured a fair education. He was a profound student even in youth. This adventurous young man landed in New York in June, 1851, before he had attained his majority. It was his intention to get a more liberal educa tion. He learned the printer's trade, and while supporting himself by labor ing in this occupation he studied medi cine and also graduated in the profes sion of topographical engineering. Be sides, he mastered the art of shorthand writing, a study of which he had be gun in England, and was employed as a reporter by different newspapers in New York and Boston. The fugitive slave law was then being put into effec tive force, and the brutalities of it en gaged his sympathetic nature and aroused his sense of justice. It was impossible for one with his conceptions of the rights of man to remain aloof and neutral in such a conflict as was then raging in the United States. He espoused the cause of the oppressed, and was soon numbered as one of the champions of freedom. He made the acquaintance of the leaders of this cause, and became an anti-slavery ad vocate. The interest aroused through out the country in the affairs of Kan sas attracted Mr. Hinton, and early in 1856 he determined to cast his lot with the struggling patriots of the terri tory. This resolution was due most largely to the conviction that the issue of freedom of Kansas meant that of emancipation also for the slave stiles. Young Hinton set out for Kansas in June. He has filed his journal of this journey in the library of the Kansas State Historical society, and it proves a valuable contribution to Kansas his tory. Under date of June 24 he says: "Shall see New York in the morning, and then westward for Kansas. . Kansas is the word, and the overruling Father of Love alone knows what will be my fate there. One thing I do know, and that is I shall not shrink from my duty, be it what it way." Colonel Hinton arrived in Kansas on August 7, 1856. On Sunday, August 31, 1856, Hinton arrived at Lawrence; "very tired and weary, but fortunately for my comfort I met a friend, Henry Sullivan, from New York, who insisted upon my (.Continued on Sixth Page.) SUES FORS78,750 Willie Sells Brings Suit to Break Will. Tells -Pathetic Story of His Early Life. HE DID NOT KNOW. Toiled For Years Supposing Sellses Were His Parents. Claims Money For His Educa tion Was Used in Show. Wants Value of Diamonds Given Supposed Mother. Two suits brought by William Sells against P. I. Bonebrake, administrator of the estate of Sarah Ann Sells, amounting to $78,750 were filed in the district court this afternoon by Ros sington, Smith & Histed and Eugene Hagan, attorneys for Mr. Sells. The petition is startling. Mrs. Sells is charged with wilfully defrauding the plaintiff and the assertion is made by William Sells that he always supposed Mrs. Sells to be his mother and Allen Sells to be his father until after the death of Mrs. Sells, who died last spring, and that he discovered after her death that his real mother had given him into the keeping of Mr. and Mrs. Sells when he was but an infant and gave them $1,500 to be used in educat ing him. That the money was used in stead by Mr. Sells and was invested in the circus business and that instead of receiving an education he, William Sella, was forced ,to spend his entire time as a member of a circus from the time he was seven years old . until he was 21. One of the suits is for $75,000. The petition sets forth that William Sells was apprenticed at the age of seven to become a bareback rider and that he became proficient and commanded a large salary. He did not receive any of his earnings. All the moneys were taken by his parents. He submitted to the conditions believing that he was their son and that he would be- their sole heir. He claims that by being led to believe that he was the son of Mr. and Airs. Sells and allowing them to have the money earned by him under such an impression he was deceived and defrauded and that outside of all money spent for him he is entitled to $75,000. The other suit is for $3,750 claimed as pay for diamonds he gave Mrs. Sarah Ann Sells. The petition states that as he thought she was his mother he gave her a. .diamond eros3 worth $800, a pair of diamond earrings worth $2,250, a diamond riflg worth $100, another diamond ring worth $80 and a diamond cluster ring worth $2o0. and other jewelry. That said defendant, P. I. Bonebrake, is- the duly qualified and acting execu tor of the last will and testament of Sarah Ann Sells, deceased, who de parted this life on the 25th day of April, 1901. That up to and until the death of the said Sarah Ann Sells this plaintiff had reason to and did believe that he was the true and lawful son of the said Sarah Ann Sells by her former husband Allen Sells, and that he was born of said Sarah Ann Sells, in the year 1865; but soon after the death of the said Sarah Ann Sells this plaintiff ascertain ed for the first time that he was not the son of either Allen Sells or Sarah Ann Sells, but that Sarah Ann Sells and Allen Sells, in the year 1865, re ceived this plaintiff, then a small in fant. from his real mother, upon the promise and agreement made by the said Sarah Ann Sells and Allen Sells that they would rear him, this plaintiff. as their own child, and from such time until the death of said Sarah Ann Sells thi nlnintifP believed that he was the only child of Alien sens and nis wire. Sarah Ann Sells, ana tne sole neir to their estate. That said plaintiff is informed and believes, and therefore charges the fact to be that he was born on tne stn day of April, 1865, and that at the time the said Sarah Ann Sells received this plaintiff from his mother, they at the same time received from this plain tiff's mother the sum of $1,500 to be in vested by the said Sarah Ann Sells and Allen Sells to properly educate and rear this plaintiff, they, the said Sarah Ann Sells and Allen sells at tnat time be ing without adequate means to pro vide for the education and care oi tnis plaintiff. And this plaintiff is further informed and believes and so charges the fact to be that instead of using said sum of $1,500 as aforesaid received from plaintiff s mother, to rear and educate this plaintiff, they, tne said saran Ann Sells and Allen Sells invested the said Bum of $1,500 in a traveling show, which was the foundation of what subse quently became known as the Sells Brothers' circus and menagene. And said plaintiff further! alleges that in the year 1872 the said Allen Sells, the husband of the said Sarah Ann Sells, in connection with his brothers. Ephraim Sells, Lewis Sells and Peter Sells, were owners of a traveling snow and menagerie known as the Sells Brothers' circus and managerie and at that time in the year 1872, the said Sarah Ann Sells and Allen Sells place this plaintiff, who was then only 7 years of age, in said circus as one of the performers thereof; tnat nis nrst act in said circus was riding a pony in the ring of said circus, which was fol lowed by years of the severest hard ship and toil in acquiring the ability to become a successful bareback rider in said circus; that from the year 1872 until he arrived at 21 years of age he followed the profession of a bareback rider of horses in said circus and other shows in which said Allen Sells was in terested; that during said period he be come famous as a rider throughout this country and Europe and was entitled to receive, and did receive, large salar ies for such performances." The petition goes on to state that from $20 to $30 a day were made from the sale of his photographs during his childhood and that until he was 21 years of age Mr. and Mrs. Sells took all he made, asserting the right to it, claiming that Mrs. Sells -was his mother. The petition says: "That from the be ginning of his tutelage as a circus per former, which, as aforesaid, begun in his most tender infancy and at a time when he should have been gently and tenderly cared for, this plaintiff was subjected at all times, to the hardest and most vigorous usage by those placed in charge to teach him this busi ness and at no time was any remission of such work and effort permitted on his (Continued on Sixth Page.) AGAINSTSCHLEY. Secretary Long Finally Dispos es of Controversy. Holds With Majority of Court on All Points. SAYS DROP IT NOW. Declines to Enter Upon (Ques tion of Command And Refuses to Hear Argument on That Point. Washington, Dec. 21. Secretary Long has disposed finally of the Schley case so far as the navy department is con cerned, by acting upon the findings and conclusions of the court of in quiry. He approves the findings of facts the opinion of the full court; he ap proves the majority opinion where there is a difference in the court; he holds that the court could not have entered into a consideration of the question of command at the battle at Santiago; and finally he accepts the recommenda tion that no further proceedings shall be had. The secretary also has declined the application of Admiral Sampson's counsel to enter upon an inquiry into the question-of command and has noti fied Admiral Schley's counsel of that fact as a reason for declining to hear them on that point. LONG S APPROVAL. Secretary Long'b approval of the ma jority report was as follows: "The department has read the testi mony in this case, the arguments of counsel at the trial, the court's findings of fact, opinion and recommendation, the individual memorandum of the pre siding member, the statements of ex ceptions to the said findings and opinion by the applicant; the reply to said statement by the judge advocate of the court and his assistant, and the briefs submitted by counsel by Rear Admiral Sampson traversing the presiding mem ber's views as to who was in command at the ' battle of Santiago, and after careful consideration the finding of facts and the opinion of the full court are approved. "As to the points on which the pre siding member differs from the ma jority of the court, the opinion of the majority is approved. "As to the further expression of his views by the same member with re gard to the questions of command on the morning of July 3, 1898, and of the title to credit for the ensuing victory, the conduct of the court in making no finding and rendering no opinion on those questions is approved indeed, it could with propriety take no other course, evidence on these questions, dur ing the inquiry, having been excluded by the court. "The department approves the recom mendation of the court that no further proceedings be had in the premises. "The department records its apprecia tion of the assiduous labors of the whole court. 

JOHN D. LONG, "Secretary of the Navy." THE SECRETARY'S LETTERS. The text of the secretary's letters to Admiral Sampson's attorneys and to Admiral Schley follows: "Navy Department, Washington, "December 20, laoi. "Gentlemen In view of the depart ment's approval, this day, of the recom mendation of the court of inquiry in the case of Rear Admiral Schley, that no further proceedings be had, and of the fact that the question of command was excluded from consideration by the court, the department will take no ac tion upon the brief filed by you in be half of Rear Admiral William T. Samp son. Very respectfully, "JOHN D. LONG, Secretary. "Messrs- Stanton, Campbell & Theall, Johnston building. No. 30 Broad street. New York." "Navy Department, Washington, "December 20, 1901. "Sir Referring to the department's letter of the 13th instant, you are ad vised that action today has been taken upon the findings, opinions and recom mendation of the court of inquiry in your case, and upon the minority opin ion of the presiding member and a copy of the indorsement is hereby trans mitted for your information. "In response to your request of the 18th instant, heretofore acknowledged. that if a protest should be filed by Rear Admiral W. T. Sampson relative to the question of command of the American naval forces during the battle of San tiago and credit for the victory won in that battle, you be accorded an oppor tunity to present, through your counsel oral argument against such protest, you are advised that a brief on this subject has this day been filed by Messrs. Stay ton, Campbell & Theall, counsel for Ad miral Sampson. In view, however, of the depart ment's approval of the recommendation of the court of inquiry that no furtner proceedings be had, and of the fact that the Question of command was excluded from consideration by the court, no ac tion will be taken upon said brief, and reply to that effect (copy enclosed) has this day been mailed to counsel for Ad miral Sampson. A copy of the report of the judge advocate of the court and his assistant upon your communication of the 18th instant, objecting to the ap proval of the :indinss of the court, is also herewith transmitted. "Very respectfully, 

"JOHN D. LONG, Secretary. Rear Admiral Winfleld S. Schley, U. S. N., retired, The Richmond, Washing ton, D. C." RAYNER IS INDIGNANT. Baltimore, Mi, Dec. 21. Isadore Ray- ner .attorney general of Maryland, and counsel for Admiral Schley when shown the decision of Secretary Long today, declared that "the whole proceeding is arbitrary and tyrannical," and mani fested great surprise and indignation. "The court decided the case, said he, without considering the testimony of Admiral Schley and his witnesses and Secretary. Long seems to have decided it without" so much as permitting us to file a reply to the protest filed by Ad miral Sampson's attorneys. This protest was filed late yesterday afternoon and just one hour ago we finished our reply to it and sent it to Washington.- "Now I understand tnat the secretary has decided against Admiral- Dewey and adverse to Schley's being in com mand at Santiago, and virtually in favor of Sampson without even permit ting us to produce before him the con clusive proof admitted at the hearing by consent, that the command prac tically and officially devolved upon Schley. The whole proceeding is too arbitrary and tyrannical for me now to discuss. I really .wonder whether the people who live under free institutions will tolerate the exercise of such des potic measures. "You ask me what our next step will be. I do not know unless the president intervenes. There is a power in the courts to compel the secretary to file the dissenting opinion of Admiral Dewey whether he agrees with it or not. We will determine next week what pro ceedings we will adopt." 

AFTERMILES. Secretary Root Asks the Gener al For an Explanation Of His Remarks on the Schley Sampson Controversy. Washington, Dec 21. Secretary Root has called upon Lieutenant General Miles, commanding the army, for an explanation of his interview printed In a Cincinnati newspaper warmly commending the opin ion of Admiral Dewey in the Schley case. Secretary Root had a long conference with the president today about General Miles' interview and the action decided upon will be announced late this after noon. The position of the administration is that nothing which tends to revive the Sampson-Schley controversy will be tolerated in any office of the army or navy. In the same connection action will be taken in the case of E. S. Maclay, whose history of the naval engagements of the Spanish war attracted much atten tion. Mr. Maclay is now employed In the Brooklyn navy yard. G. A. a
