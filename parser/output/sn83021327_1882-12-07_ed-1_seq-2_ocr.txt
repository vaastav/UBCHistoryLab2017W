THE STATESMAN. AU8T1H, TEXAS. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Yesterday our columns were swelled . with the full report of the president's message, sent over the wires by the Western Associated Press, which now serves the Statesman with its daily press reports. It was a vast amount of matter to come over the wires twenty-two thousand 'words in all and upon sober reflection we are not prepared to endorse its substance, as either vastly Intellectual or very statesmanlike. There is nothing marked in his suggestions as to for eign policy, except, perhaps, in his re ference to the Chill-Peruvian war and the conditions of Peru's subjuga tion. These are very hard, as every body knows, and yet the Peruvians rushed into the trouble, and having sown the whirlwind they have reaped the tempest, and now can be left, without much compunction, to their fate. He is opposed to the United .States interfering, backed by its navy, to enforce the future recogni tion of Peru's independence, and in this he shows signal discretion. It would certainly' not do for us to enforce Teru with a navy not more than one-tenth as powerful as that of the pretentious little re public of the Pacific coast. In this the president is even wise, There is nothing particularly oticea ble under the head of foreign relations. The treasury, his next theme is an In teresting one, in the abstract, but the president throws no additional light upon it. The commerce of the coun try comes in for its usual share of ob servation, merely a fashion establish ed by his predecessors, but not credita ble in its foreign aspect, when com pared with a series of years, from 1876 to 1882. The president dwells, under this head, with apparent delight upon the fact that in the year just closed there have been organized 171 nation si banks, there being now of these In stitutions 2209, "a larger number than ever before;" and yet he fears a seri ous contraction of the currency of these banks. lie declares against sil ver coinage, and is guilty of an unnec essary reflection when he asks con gress to "free the treasury of its ex cess of assets." The powerful lobby, now organized at "Washington with the president's friend. Gen. Grant, at its head, would have seen to this trifling matter without his making so glaring a reference to It ridiculous. But he warms up to the Republican standard when dilat ing upon the question of taxation, lie wants reduction of taxation, of course, and urges that it be given through the curtailing of internal revenues, "retaining that portion of the system least objectionable to the people." Here let us call attention to the fact that the president becomes the special advocate of reducing the tax on whiskies and tobacco, thus show ing his estimate of what is of most vital importance to the people. After urging cheaper whisky and cheaper tobacco however, he advises congress, in pop ular vernacular, to then "go slow," as the country must be prepared to - pay over $100,000,000 annually on ac count of pensions. In discussing cus toms dues he makes the old appeal in favor of " domestic labor," even after it has been demonstrated, thousands of times, that this "domestic labor" is simply used as the cat's paw, gathering chestnuts for the protected monopolists. He would go as far as possible towards making free whisky md free tobacco, but would perpetuate protection for the manufacturers, who supply the consuming masses with all necessities, the farmers with all im plements, artisans with all tools housekeepers with all utensils, the masses with clothes, tern of taxation would perpetuate, demned by all Such is the sys the president It is one con honest men, a departure from which is demanded by at least five-eixths of the people of the Uiiited States. There is nothing startling in any suggestions made as to the conduct' of internal affairs. The Indians have about ceased to be a very disturbing element; sea coast defenses are at a discount, in face of the fact that Republican admininis- trations have spent vast sums avow edly for sea coast defense: the militia, he suggests, needs better arm . ing, and the navy, "Sir Joseph" Ilunt's late pride, is the most worthless of any first-class power in the world, though more money has been drawn from the treasury, in pretense for naval expenditures, than has been ex pendedby Great Britain in making the most powerful navy in the world. In discussing the navy the president is forced to enlarge uimn the service of the Jeannette crew to present any record whatever worth relating. As to the costal service, it is admitted that it has been quite well administered, but a machine which Is laying up a cash balance on carrying the mail matter of the people ought to be in a fair condi tion of service. It is thought the ju diciary is equal to the star route emer gency, but the country really fears it is not. and hopes any effort to convict the thieves may meet with success. He wants a bankrupt law established, and so do a few starving lawyers throughout the country. Of course the president want civil service reform. The Republican presidents have been talking about civil service reform for twentv vears. and all this time reform has been going back wards. The civil service re form, for instance, which led to Mr. Arthur being removed from the New York custom house, culmi nates in making this same Mr. Arthur president of the United States. Alto gether this inaugural paper is a very thin affair. It is not statesmanlike it Is not wise; it does not show any sort of marked ability, and it had just as well never been written as for any good it may do the country, THE 

TRANSIT OF VEXUS. To-day Venus passes across the disc of the sun. It is said that if the or Lits of the planets were In the same rlane with that of our earth, there would be a transit every time Venus completed her revolution with re spect to us. As i ia, sometimes she passes Rixne and sometimes below the sun. Owing to certain peculiarities of the planets motions, the transits occur in pairs, the two of a pair being nepai-atpd by a period of eight years, while the p;iirs are distant from each other, alternately 105 and 121 v . nrs. We are now approaching the second of a pair, the first of which was widely observed in 1874. The next pair will be seen in the years 2003 and 2012, and since there will not be many of us left to take a deep in terest in the next exhibition we had better make the best of the de monstration of to-day. Scientific ex peditions have been fitted up by all civilized nations to watch the transit, and millions of money are being thus expended. An astronomical writer explains that the telescope observa tions will consist in noting the times (1) when the round dark ball of Yenus first makes a notch on the solar disk; (2)when it shows itself as a completed circle and the light of the sun first glimmers across behind its moving ball; (3) when it reaches the other side and first joins its dark body to the darkness around the sun, and (4) when its retreating form finally leaves the disk. These four "contacts" must be very carefully watched, and their times to the nearest second determined. The regular observers sent out by the transit of Yenus commirsion have all been practised on an artificial transit, w hich consists of a round black disk of tin, moving out from behind tin partitions across a bright background. The disk moves by clock work, at about the rate of the real Yenus, and many of the circumstances of the motion are the same. There is the same tremor of the light just before it shoots across at interval contact, which renders any exact determina tion of the time impossible, and the same inability to see the notch the first instant of its formation at exter nal contact But the artificial transit will not produce the effect of the real planet's atmosphere, and the "black drop," a band of darkness which seems to join the dark planet to the edge of the disk for several seconds after it appears wholly projected on the sun, is not visible. Neither are the effects of diffraction, which make a light Ixxly appear larger than it really is. The first contact will 15 at about 9.02 a. m.; the second about 9.23; the third about 3.00 p. m., and the fourth about 3.21. Venus cannot be seen as she approaches the disk of the sun, unless possibly a faint ring of light, due to the refraction of her atmosphere, shall make her outline visible. When she is partly projected on the disc, a thread of light around her can doubtless be seen, owing to this cause. The first intimation of her coraingwlll probably be the round notch cut from the disc of the sun. This notch will appear at a point 147 degrees from the north point of thesun, measured around by way of the east. Those who cannot command the use of a telescope may see through a piece of smoked glass the dark round mass of the planet entering on the southeast and passing off on the southwest limb of the sun. But the main reliance of the American astron omers is on tne photographs or tne sun with Venus on it, which will be taken during the transit. It is prob able that each of the eight parties sent out by the commission will secure about two hundred photographs. These are taken at the focus of a lens alxut eight inches in diameter, set vertically. The sun is reflected through this lens by a heliostat of un silvered glass. The image of the sun thus formed forty feet from the lens is four inches in diameter. The part of the light after passing through the lens is covered with a wooden roof to cut out side light. The arrangement is in reality a fixed telescope, in which the eye piece is dispensed with, and the tube is the wooden roof. The heli ostat moves by clock work, which causes it to keep the sun reflected through the lens. In front of the sensitive plate is a glass covered with a reticule, which is photographed on the sun to detect any sliding of the film. A plumb line is also photo graphed so that the vertical of the picture is correctly known. The scale is ascertained when the distance be tween the lens and the sensitive plate is definitely known, and distortion is guarded against by the accuracy of the curvature of the lens, and the ac curacy of the - flatness of the mirror. The transit will be widely observed. The $75,000 which congress appropriated will put in the field eight parties, which are stationed respec tively at Cape of Good Hope, New Zealand, Santiago, Patagonia, New Mexico, Texas, Florjdaand "Washing ton. The English; Trench and Ger man governments-' also send out a number of parties. Besides these, there will be many observations of contact and some photographs obtain ed at the various observatories of the United States. It is hardly possible that clouds will interfere at all the stations, widely separated as they are. But will the results of 1882 be any gain -over those oi previous tran sits? The observations of 1761 and 1769 show such a wide discrepancy that they did not make us certain as to the distance of the sun within about four million miles. The Eng lish observations of contracts in 1874 narrow this down to 1M million. But this is a wide margin. So difficult it is to compare observations made under different circumstances of atmosphere and instruments, so diverse are the phenomena Been and so various are the times recorded for them, that it is hardly likely that the most favorable results will do more than diminish the uncertainty. HOW THEY PROPOSE TO DECEITE. Federal aid in the abolition of illit eracy is to be urged by some of the southern members of the next con gress, and the Republican organs are insisting that such a measure should not be left for the consideration of Democrats, while the revision of the tariff as well, should be shaped by Republicans. Such declarations show the utter despair of these people. In the one instance they are afraid the proposed Democratic legislation against illiteracy might rob them of some strength in the south, while in the other case they would deceive the people by adopting measures of re duction in which the monopolists would still have the advantage of a tax against the masses for their spe cial enrichment. The purpose; as shown by the president's message, is to make a great ado about internal taxation, reducing it, as he says, some $55,000,000 on whisky and tobacco and such things, while the farmer and the mechanic and and the housekeeper, in fact all con sumers, would continue to pay enor mous taxes to home manufacturers, that foreign manufacturers may be allowed the privilege of not supplying public wants at one-half or less what they are required to pay to the protect- ed monopolists. Remember that the federal government receives no tax, but that protection forces the tax to be paid to the manufacturer on his products. It is a tax which amounts to many billions of dollars, and by calling attention to a reduction of a few millions in internal revenues on whiskies and tobaccos, etc., they hope to deceive the people. Let us suppose that the fifty millions of people in the United States use but twenty dollars worth of wooden goods each, in one year. Here are 81,000,000,000 paid on this one account, of which one-half is a tax for the ben efit of the manufacturers, the govern ment receiving not one dollar thereon. And, j et, the president lays stress on saving the people 855,000,000 in inter nal taxation, chiefly on whiskies and tobacco. Will the minority in this congress allow such deception to go unrebuked? Can it not even be pre vented?

A special from Key "West to the Jacksonville Times says that a diffi culty took place on the 27th inst. be tween Lieut. Gov. Bethel and Mr. C. B. Pendleton, editor of the Key West Democrat. Bethel insulted Pendleton publicly in the court room, and after the adjournment of court Pendleton spat in the lieutenant governor's face and horsewhipped him. A New York paper is responsible for the statement that the patent ma chine business was never livelier than now; that the Americans use more patent meaicines man any oiner peo ple in the world; that every cold snap gives the trade a stimulus, primarily because 60 per cent, of all patent medi cines are for the relief of coughs, colds or some form of pulmonary complaint. Editor Lotran. of the Montreal Star, was dying of typhoid fever. Speaking at intervals in his delerium, he said: " I have a brother." "A storm is coin ing on."

His mind wandered to other matters, but always returned to his brother, who as it was afterwards learned, was at that very moment drowning in a storm. Those who believe in second sight will not accept the theory of chance in this strange and well authenticated case. Mr. F. Lupton. governor of the Egyptian province of Bahr el Ghazel, reports, on what he believes to be creditable authority, the discovery of an equatorial laKe in central Ainca.

It takes them three days to cross the lake in boats. The governor thinks the outlet oi the lake runs into the Congo. The tribe goes by the name of Barboas. and shows some skill in manufacturing cloth from grasses, of which clothing is made. The Anti-Jewish Movement in Europe. New Orleans Times-Democrat Although we hear little of the anti Jewish movement in Europe, it is by no means dead ; indeed it has lately spread into Austria, and the populace of that empire is being worked up and excited like the Russians and Germans, against their Jewish fellow- citizens. How utterlv barbarous and contrary to all the principles of civilization and Christianity is this movement, is well shown in the demand recently made by an anti-Semitic meeting in Vienna. This bodv askea that tne. jewisn population of the empire be restricted within certain boundaries, ana resi dence outside of these boundaries al lowed only upon special license and the payment oi a tee no change or. residence except upon payment or a certain tax; no Jew to own real pro perty, either in city or country; mar riage to only be allowed by special li cense; no Jew to have a right to vote or to enter any mechanical or artisan vocation, or to hold any public office; all Jews to pay a toleration tax, and the number permitted to live in the empire to be limited and fixed. It is remarkable that such proposi tions should be publicly advocated at this day in the capital of the Aus trian empire; and yet there are many reasons to believe that these doctrines find supporters and advocates throughout the empire. Fortunately for Austria, however, the emperor has taken a very decided stand in opposition to this anti-Jewish move ment, and will not only see to it that his Semitic subjects are not molested and persecuted, but has actually pro hibited the holding or meetings such as this, aimed to stir up religious strife and animosity, and has commissioned the police to break them up. Such energetic measures on his part will probably stem this movement in Aus tria in its incipiency, and before it be comes as troublesome and as dangerous as in the dominions of the Czar and the Kaiser.

The Saradies is situated in the cen tre of Moscow, not far from the bourse and the busiest parts of the city, and consists of a number of small, narrow streets, each court in which forms a complete quarter. In every little street, where the utmost peace prevails from arly morning to late at night, one may see numerous samples of the full bearded and long-frocked Jews, who are usually to be met with only in remote districts of Lithuania and the Polish provinces. In every court there is a Minyam either of Chassidim or of Misnagnim, or of both at the same "time as well as one or two Jewish kitchens. But although the Saradie is the Jewish' colony, there are not a few Jews who possess the hand somest palaces in the finest streets of the city, such as the magnificent resi dences of M. Malkiel and M. Pollia koff in the Twerskaja street. On the whole the Sardia contains only the very poorest portion of the Jewish colony as its permanent residents, and the poverty and misery which prevail there are almost indescribable. In fiict one wonders why these poor peo ple came to Moscow almost to starve. To speak truly, the wealthier portion of the Jewish population of Moscow are greatly to blame for the sad con dition of their . poorer brethren, as they are almost totally indifferent to their unhappy fate. The Jewish colony in the Saradie is for the most part recruited by ex-soldiers, artisans, petty tradesmen, and commission agents from the provinces of Lithuania. Little Russia, "Wolhynia, Podnlia and Poland. The Jews from Courland and Livonia, of whom there area large numler in Moscow, are much better off than the rest of their co-religionists, and as they live in dif ferent parts of the city, they have nothing in common with the Saradie and its inhabitants, whilst they keep up a close intimacy with the large number of cultural "Jews. POLITICAL NOTES. Senator Mitchell was credited with having relaxed his ze;d as a reformer, but he rises to remark that the bosses must take their hands from the throat of the "grand old party," or continue to suffer defeat not only in his state but in the country. That eminent "Christian states man," Schuyler Colfax, sagely ob serves that the Republican party is safer and wiser now than ever. It oc curs to the Philadelphia Press that by a fortuitous circumstance, this is partly true of Colfax himself. "The great principles of the Demo cratic party, if there are any, need codification," remarks Editor Hal stead. The Hartford Times hits back neatly by inviting Halstead's atten tion to the constitution of the United States, where they have been pretty well codified.

He is said to be over 50 years old, and rap idly growing lntirm, and on tnis ac count the governor was appealed to by disinterested parties, one of them a prominent minister of this city. The governor said that whue he ieit lor the untortunate man, stiii mat would not be a sufficient reason to give the people, who have a right to demand a reason, why executive cle mency is extended to a prisoner after so many courts of justice have pro nounced his sentence just. The pri soner, undoubtedly, is on a rapid de cline; and, if infirmity is a just cause for clemency, Hanks will most assur edly deserve such in a short time. Will They Be True 1 Philadelphia Record.
