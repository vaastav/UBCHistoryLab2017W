DON'TBEUEVE STORIES OF HAITIEN CRUELTIES Knoxvllle. Dec. 8. (Special.) "I am of the opinion that the alleged cruel lies sain 10 nave iivm iamuiiiiiicu m Haltll bv the United States marines never happened," says Sergt. John F. Davis, of this cuy, wno saw service in Haltll. being, chief operator of the radio station at Port Au Prince while stationed there. Sergt. Davis stated that the bandits of Haltll try to rule the country as Is the case In Mexico, and the disorders which have happened there have all arisen from this. Bandit chiefs there collect a large band of plunderers and make rains everywhere, tne marine camps not being exempt from these forays. A few of these bandits were killed during such raids but always In eelfdefense. In every combat of this kind, however, the officers in charge gave It their direct and best attentions, stated Sergt. Davis, and so far as he knows no cruelties resulted from these raids. Sergt. Davis stated he heard while there that marines who had been murdered by the bandits were found with their bodies preatly mutilated, the hoiirt, brains and other vital parts hav ing been removed.

New York City. VALEDICTORY ON TREATY (BY DAVID LAWRENCE 1 Washington, Dec. . (Copyright tor The Chattanooga News.) President llson deals with the treaty and league of nations only In the moat ab stract way In his annual message to congress. He does, however, make specific reference t the state of the nation's finances and seeks to put the burden partly on the war. nartlv on the fall lire of the laat congress to reduce the coat of living and nartlv on the In difference of the legislative body to tne recommendations made hy the Wilson administration In the laat ses sion. The president Insists that our eco nomic future depends "upon the main tenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high level" and he emphasizes the fundamental fact that "eeven and a half hllllons of war Indebtedness ma ture -within the next two and a half years." Mr. Wilson advocates economy, hut brings out a fact seldom reallied about the method of making appropriations, namely, the practice of taklriR money out of the so-called revolving funds. The president couldn't resist the temptation to point out by' Implica tion that although the republican! In the last congress boasted ahnut re ducing the estimates of the executive departments by a billion dollars, they turned around and authorized the ex penditure of over a billion dollars "In nddlflon to the nmounts shown In the usual complied statements of appropriations." Takes Quirt Fling. The president takes a quiet fling at the people who Insisted UDon the prompt return of the railroads to private ownership by pointing out that the finances of the entire government have been disturbed "by the extraor dinary burdens thrown upon the treas ury by the transportation act." He declares that over ' $1500,00,000 has al ready been paid to the railroads and that further payments estimated to agcregate about 1650.000,000 more must ull be paid to the railroads during the current year In other words, the president points out that the railroads cost the gov ernment In the nelghhorhod of a billion dollars which wasn't mentioned very much when the republicans were talk ing about the amount of money they saved during the last session. Mr. Wilson's message was regarded by many who heard it as having plainly the partisan touch. It was looked upon os a parting shot at the republicans who shouted economy and are now con fronted with the serious responsibility of meeting seven and a half billion dol lars of Indebtedness and other big ob ligations. Mr. Wilson approves Sec retary Houston's program for tax re vision, whiA will be made public in his annual report tomorrow. To Prove U. S. Sincerity. Specifically the president takes occa sion to urge a loan for Armenia to be supervised by a special commission and he lays on the doorstep of congress a recommendation that the Philippines be given their Independence as a proof of America's sincerity In talking about self-determination for small nations. The only reference to the tariff is a suggestion that the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals be pro tected. Mr. Wilson repetts the rec ommendations he made to the repub licans during the last congress, namely, the passage of a cold storage law regu lating the time that goods may be kept in storage and the marking of prices on every commodity shipped Interstate commerce, including the selling or mar ket price at the time the goods went Into storage so that the purchaser might be able to learn the profits of the mid dle man. He also refers again to his recommendation In regard to federal licenses for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce. Treaty Valedictory. The closing paragraph is looked upon as a valedictory on the trenty question and an earnest of Mr. Wilson's inten tion to keep on fighting for the league of nations. In his conclusion, the pres ident said: "I have not so much laid before you, a series of recommendations, gentle men, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith In which I was bred and which it Is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future and of all the victories which await national action In the days to come, whether In Amer ica or elsewhere." The president did not go to congress. Clerks read the message in each of the two houses. Meanwhile, Mr. Wilson himself chafed under the advice of his physician and others In the household who thought that while he might be well enough to read the address, he ought not take the risk of excitement or the consequences of a wave of emo tion In addressing congress for the last time.
