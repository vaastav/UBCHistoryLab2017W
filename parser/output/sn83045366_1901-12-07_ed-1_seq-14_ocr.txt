It a')RMAL biographies do not always reveal the character are written by It Is, in fact, a rare achievement when they do. If they are written by a I film! hostile hand they are generally offensively hypocritical. If written by a IliJwln friendly hand, they are apt. to conceal facts. An unbiased biographer is 1 ~ ' hard to find. We cannot expect Mr. Morley to say anything unfavorable to Gladstone in the biography he is preparing of the, Grand Old Man. A public man : reveals himself more candidly in his private correspondence than in his public speeches. ! :'v y The charm of Mr. Seudder's life of Lowell, recently issued Is in the large ' amount of space which is given to Lowell's own letters. We get at the real char acter and disposition of Lowell more accurately in the letters than through any other source. When an individual of note talks to a friend or acquaintance in a letter, he . is under no pressure of publicity which puts him on dress parade, but usually utters his thoughts undisguised and under no restraint which stiffens his rhetoric and - strangles simplicity of diction. The letters of Lowell to his family and friends are written with a refreshing abandon, bred of the conscious freedom from restraint. In', his private letters touching politics we get his sageat conclusions and criticisms. ', Any one who has read the. two volumes of Matthew Arnold's letters will recog nize the strong portrayal of his real character,'its strength and weaknesses, in that correspondence. Arnold is refreshingly candid in his private letters and that is \ 1 what.makes them Interesting. Coleridge's letters also reveal the man as his poetry, | and published prose fail to do. "-. ; - ■'■ v ■; ■y:.-:, ■- •-;■_- ■■ Busch does not tell as much about the real Bismarck as the love letters of the great chancellor reveal. The latter present another side to his character. Victor I Hugo's love letters to the girl who became his wife, reveal a charming phase of his | character. The love letters/of the Brownings deal perhaps too much with an almost sacred phase of human life for publicity and yet they comprise Indispensable auto biographies to the public complementary of existing biographies and the poems. ;:-~ It has been said that the highest art is unconscious and so in the abandon of private ; letter writing, people of genius do some of their best work. It is not always possible I 1 to secure the private correspondence of such a man as Lowell and in some cases it I must be admitted that publication of private correspondence is not always advisable, j as in the case of the Carlyle letters, many of which might safely have ;been consigned to the devouring flames. The letters of Goethe and Schiller are very excellent read- | Ing, for these great poets and philosophrs wrote to each other with a fine abandon j I and discuss all things literary, political and domestic,—even a child with the croup j ! and measles. They pass from the atmosphere of Parnassus to the atmosphere of the j kitchen. Those are letters worth reading. New Books The Rights of Mam A Study in Twenti eth Century Problems. By Lyman Abbott, I>. D. New York: Houghton, Mifflin & Co. Minneapolis: Nathaniel McCarthy. Price, This is a book for the man who came out of the last presidential campaign with in choate ideas of what are the rights of man, the authority and powers ot government and the lights of nations. !?or the man who be lieves with all his might !u the course of the American government In the Philippines but is sometimes put to it to defend it on eth ical and high political grounds, and to the man who feels that, somehow, though we are doing cur duty in ths Philippines, it is not possible to reconcile what we are doing with the ideals of self-government and the senti ments of the Declaration of Independence, and also for the man who is certain that wo appear in the Philippines as usurpers and robbers and nothing else—for all these this book is good. It Is by no means a discus sion of the Philippines problem—that is merely touched on in as incidental way. Yet the book is a collection ot lectures delivered during the first part of the present year and were inspired by the discussion of the rights of man that were brought forward in the campaign of 1900 in considering the Philip pines problem. The book is a good one for any man to read who has to admit to him self that he does not know what are the rights of man, who has n> theory of the nature and origin of government, and also for the man who has knowledge In these matter.-, if they wish to know what a thinker holds in regard to them. Dr. Abbott rejects the theory that all just governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed, a notion that has THE 

MINNEAPOLIS JOURNAL. been made a fetish because it happened to be embodied in the great De-laration of Inde pendence. Likewise he rejects its antithesis —that governments are based on the power of the governors. He holds that government grows out of the instinct of self-protection— at first protection for the individual, then protection for his family, then for a group of families, then for the nation. The object of government aud its essential function are the protection of tlie governed. Any government that succeeds in performing that function is v just government, whatever be Its form. Or. Abbott shows how through the centuries the Hebraic idea of social organization as being for the benefit of the people has battled with the imperial aud Roman Idea of government as being for the benefit of the few. In mod ern times, under the stimulus of the reforma tion, the French revolution, the English revo lution, Cromwell anfl Napoleon. Luther, the Puritans, Rousseau and Vollaire, the Hebraic idea has come to dominate the western world, so that, whatever be the form of Its govern ments, their object is held to be the welfare of the people. The personal, political, in dustrial and religious rights of man are de fined and discussed. In later chapters Dr. Abbott deals with "The American Democ racy," "American Domestic Problems," "American Foreign Problems," "The Perils of Democracy," "Safeguards." "The Goal of Democracy." Under these headings the au thor speaks luminously of all the engrossing questions of the day, points out the perils that menace us and possible ways in which they may be overcome. It is worth while to repeat again that whatever may be one's views on the question ofgovernnient tbis book is a good one to read to get bearings, to bring order out of chaptjc ideas and to get a grasps of the various theories of government. To get great good out of this brief, rlear and concise book it is not Decessary to agree with the author, and, perhaps, few readers will agree with him on every point. For the average man whose recollection of his poli tical science and civil government studies Is rather rusty, for the man who never had such studies, this book, well-read, is worth months of desultory reading. Moreover, Dr. Abbott gives with it a compendious bibliography, which points the way for those who would follow the subject farther. Colonial Fishts and Fighters. Stories of Exploration, Adventure and Battle on the American Continent Prior to the War of the Revolution. By Cyrus Townsend Brady, author of American Fights and Fighters. Illustrated. New York: McClure, Phillips & Co. -Minneapolis: N. McCarthy. Price, $1.20 net. Mr. Brady has proved himself a most fas cinating raconteur of daring historic exploits His earlier book of missionary experience in the west foreshadowed a writer of originality, but not one with such fruitful resources as a writer of adventures by sea and by land. In this book we have the story of De Soto and his tragica-l end freshly and effectively told, he being one of the first to engage in leading European adventures to the new hemisphere which Columbus, after the Norse men, had opened to the cupidity of a gold hunting world. An Interesting account of the first Huguenot settlement on the north con tinent is given, and there is a rarely good story of the Buccaneers and the deviltry of Morgan, the pet of Charles 11. Then we have some chapters of Frontenac's exploits, and deeply interesting sketches of the wars of the 'French and Indians with the English, which determined the control of this conti nent at the fall of Quebec. The House With the Green Shutters. By George Douglas. New York: McClure, Phillips & Co. Minneapolis: N. McCarthy. Price, $1.50. This is a weird, tragical tale of English rural village life, written with real power, the author's title suggesting mystery, indeed, but i hardly the desolating tragedy which seemed to visit the sins of the brutal head of the house of John Gourlay. The man had en riched himself by dishonest means;* was a brue at home and a terror to his neighbors of the little town of Barbie; vengeful, with an ominous "black glower in his c'en," ■which his men dreaded. When Gourlay'* carts started out in the morning, Barbie awoke from its lethargy. Gourlay had all the car trying trade of Barbie. He fought'every one who tried to compete. He multiplied secret enemies. Gourlay was a brute to his wife. Their son John and daughter Janet lived In no Paradise. When, in the course of time, Gourlay found his enemies gaining ground and adopting better methods than his, the demon in him broke loose, notably when one Wilson openly defied him and encouraged Barbie generally to move against his tyranny. He found himself outwitted. Others got the beat contracts for carting. John, the; sou, is sent to school, ,but the atavic thirst for drink and instinctive' deviltry is upon him. The remaining chapters are thrilling and , ghastly enough to make the hair stand on end and the blood get down to the temperature of Andre's tomb. Fortunately for the Gour lay family, their deaths nearly synchronize. It is all very frightful, and yet the reader can't feel sorry for one of them except Janet. The Marrow of Tradition. By Charles W. Chesnutt. Boston: Houghton, Mif flin & Co. Minneapolis: N. McCarthy Price, $1.60. Mr. Chestr.utt, in his "The Wife of" His Youth" and "The House Behind the Cedars," as In this book, has shown his predilection for ■writing books upon the color line. Of negro blood himself, he has made some strong presentations of the awkward predicaments In which some southern men women find themselves by reason of father's or grand father's entangling alliances with negresßes. In "The Marrow ,of Tradition" there Is a painful "discovery," like that in "The House Behind the Cedars," which develops ' much discomfort to the noble bouse of Carteret. The major's wife's sister -was born of a ne gress by her own father, and spirited away, becoming ultimately the wife of a negro doc tor. The perplexities engendered by the In cident—for Millet's father bought the old Carteret mansion and the doctor and his wife lived in it—are Interestingly described. Some of them are very painful. Major Carteret was an extreme | advocate of negro disfran chisement. Even ■to save his own child he refused to call io Miller as a consulting phy sician, although Miller was an acknowledged expert.. The closing , scene is very finely ■wrought;, Jpr & hh^wj^jPJffrarat.'a wife 'going SATURDAY EVENING, DECEMBEE 7, 1901. alone to Miller's wife and beseeching her on her knees to induce her -husband to come and save her child. There Is recrimination on Che part of the negro sister; abject humility on the part of the other; Blow yielding on the part of the former;/ more forceful plead ing on the part of the latter, until she con sents to have her husband go. Major Car teret's views are expressed in this utterance of his: "The old times have vanished, the old ties have been ruptured. The old rela tions of dependence and loyal obedience on the part of the colored people, the responsi bility of protection and kindness upon that of the /whites, ; have passed away forever. The young negroes are too self-assertive; education is spoiling them; they 'have been badly taught.. They are, not content with their.station in life. Some time they will overstep the mark. The white people are patient, but there is a limit to their endur ance." So say many of the "majahs" yet. They are losing' their grip. The timed have changed, but they change not with the spirit of tlin age, nor meet the responsibilities placed upon them, and evade them to their own hurt. ■ l.itf 011 the Snme. My Personal Recollec tions and Experiences. By Clara Morris New York: MeOlure, Phillips & Co. Minneap olis: N. McCarthy. Price, Jl.uO, with por trait. The autobiography or' an actress Is not necessarily a readable book, for the lives of many actresses have been very dull. (Mara Morris, however, has had nu unusually in teresting career. She has much more to write about than Mrs. Mowatt and others. These biographical sketches have largely appeared serially in McClure's, but they well bear reprinting. Clara Morris began with a re solve to be successful when sfhe was a youn^ girl. She began as a marvel of emotional expression, ai:d she won all her successes by fitting henseli' absolutely in the character which she personated. A woman who has played on the stage with Conway, Murdoch, Dan Getchell, Wilkes Booth, Mrs. Bowers, C. W. Couldock, Sallie St. Claire, Mrs. Keai:, E. L. Davenport, Lawrence Barrett, J. G. Owens and others of that line, necessarily has something to say, and she says it well. Clara Morris was once supposed to be in a chronic condition of hysteria, but it is evi dent that the trouble was, she lo9t herself so repeatedly in the characters 'she assumed that she could not find herself again, as she could not very well be perpetually labeling herself. The Making' of an -American. By Jacob A. RHs. New York: The Macmillan com pany. This is the book for the man who has read his fill of current novels and longs again for the true story, the account of something that has actually hanpened. The book is an GERMAN EMPEROR'S BOOK PLATE. autobiography—the ltfe-story of a Dane born and reared who came to America, plunged into the thick of the fray and in becoming a thorough American made America better for his becoming. Any one who has read "How the Other Half Lives" is well aware that the tireless police reporter and prac tical reformer must have an interesting lift story to tell if he would. At last he has given it to us, and like so much else that he has done the world is better for it. No per son can read "The Making of an American" and not be refreshed,encouraged and strength ened. Not that it is merely a preachy com position, for it Is full of life and move ment, of anecdote and episodes, pen pictures and fascinating narratives—but that it has throughout a moral fiber that is contagious —if such a thing as moral fiber can correctly be described as contagious. Andrew Lang warus us that the people who read novels persistently will not read, labeled as fact, the same book that they will read eagerly be it only called a story. If that kind of person reads these lines he should resolve to assert himself, overcome the bondage of the novel and read this book of Mr. Rlis*. It Is a delightfully personal and intimate book. It lets us see into the very soul of the man, to know his joys and troubles, his youthful romance, the story of bis happy marriage, the bitterness of hla defeats and rebuffs in the new world, the Joy of hia triumph. We see him as the green Immigrant, as the polio? reporter who fights his way to the top of his class, who battles day and night for the news, who believes in his calling and takes supreme delight in it. Then step by step, out of the reporter immersed in the daily struggle for "scoops," panting with the hot pursuit of stories of crime and wrong, we see the reformer growing, the actor emerging out of the spectator. A score of years in the slums laid the foundation for the work that was to overthrow the slums. The battle with the slums is of intense Interest, even as here briefly told, as part of a life work. As it proceeds and we see the police lodging J^* ': '/, . ...','.: '.-'■' • —From "Little Men," Little, Brown & Co. rooms disappear, the water supply Improved, Mulberry bend tenements torn down and re placed with a park., truant schools for boys of spirit and waywardness, playgrounds for children, alley tenements destroyed, the pub lio conscience awakened, we realize how potential one little man may be, if he Is determined to do. It is not difficult after reading this book to understand the attach ment that exists between Mr. Rlls and President Roosevelt. If ever there were an exemplification of the strenuous life the president preaches it is to be found in Mr. Riis' experience. His book, though it never boasts, gives one the Impression that he Is a combination of tireless energy and in domitable purpose. A-part of the book deals with the work of improvement and reform the president accomplished in New York as a police commissioner and member of the health board. But, after all, we keep turning back to tho personal and doraesdo side of the book. We admire Mr. Rits for -what he does, but we are moved to Joy and tears with him as he touches on the family life, the visits to the old home in the little old town In Denmark, the family reunion. We feel, when we are through tne book, that -we know Mr. Hits and Mrs. Riis and their happy children; that we have been in their home and in the re porter's study—and we are glad that we know all these things. A life so rich in ex perience has yielded dozens of good anec dotes, and Mr. Riis tells them well. The book is written in the best newspa per style, and that comes very near to being the literary style of this matter-of-fact gen eration—that uses words and sentences to say what is to De said, with so little regard for literary ornament. It Is a book of short sentences, a book of idioms; and, though it I ' - <f*,i:i ' '* ""* ■ ■ ■■.•..■■'■■■■...■. ■■.... is a police reporter's book, it has almost no | slang. But the very absence of effort after j style gives us the style we all like—the qui.-k, j nervous way of the man who is filled with what he has to say and wants to say just as much as he can in a limited time and a dtiinite space. So our interest is kept up lo thr> end. We are as eager to get to the next sentence as the writer himself. It deems a safe prediction that "The .Making of an American" will be as pronounced and as en during in popularity as "How the Giber Half Lives." By Rroail Alfme. By 1. K. Friedman, author of "The Lucky Number and Poor People." New York: McClure, Phillips & Co. Minneapolis: N. McCarthy. Price, $1.50. This is a very effectively written novel. : Blair Carrhart, the hero, graduates with hon ors; has strong convictions of the necessity ! of helping humanity to better conditions. He enters the ministry first and fails to find the field he desires as a social reformer. He de termines to go through the storm and stress of labor's experience himself, and becomes" a workman in a great rolling-mill, meantime falling in love with the daughter of the pro prietor. Carrhart goes through every ex perience of labor and went through the hor lors of a great strike, the physical violence of which he tried to stop in vain, and was wounded for his ■pains. Ultimately he finds he had taken the wrong way to help hunian j ity, and he started anew in the championship of the co-operative principle in industry. A strong feature of the book is the ardent love of Evangeline Marvin for Carrhart, sacri ficing home and wealth for him, and he seemed worthy of such love. Stories of Enchant incut. By Jane Pentzer Myers. Illustrated by Harriet Roosevelt Richards. Chicago: A. C. Mc- Clurg & Co. Here is a group of stories which will fascin ate old and young equally. They come from many different localities In the realm of en chantment. "The Ghost Flower, or the White Blackbird," tells of their origin in Indian legend. "The Little Yellow Moccasins" is of Indian origin in lowa, the yellow flowers springing up and multiplying from a boy's moccasins into memorials of a mother's love. "The Little Ghost Who Laughed" is a south ern negro wonder tale. "Tolania's Maid of Honor" is a tale of fairy lund aud "The Corn Fairy" is an alluring fairy tale of the corn field and husking. "The Mist Lady' is a beautiful story of a sweet vision which came to a little lame girl. And there are many others. The Argonauta. By Eliza Orzeszko. Translated from the Polish by Jeremiah Curtin. New York: Charles Scribuer's Sons: Minneapolis: N. McCarthy. Price, $1.50. Mr. Curtin has by the fine translation of this book^made us acquainted with another Polish novelist who has great distinction in her own country. Miss Orzeszko's "Argo nauts" Is, in some respects, a better novel than any of Sienkiewicz's productions. She is not so diffuse as Sienkiewicz. She is highly dramatic in portraying emotions. Mr. Curtin says she is "the greatest female writer and thinker in the Slav world at present." That is saying much iv her favor. She has written forty books and if they are all as interesting as "The Argonauts" American readers would surely like to have Mr. Curtin translate more of them. The central figure in "The Argo nauts" is Aloysius Darvid, a man of millions —a man who sought and seized the Golden Fle,eee, against all odds, living in a palace, almost a stranger to his family by reason of his frequent absences in quest of more wealth, more investments with which to make money. He inherited nothing but an iron will to acquire wealth, lie had "the courage of the lion and the caution of the fox, the talons of the falcon and the elasticity of the cat; his life was passed at a gaming table, composed of the whole surface of a A
