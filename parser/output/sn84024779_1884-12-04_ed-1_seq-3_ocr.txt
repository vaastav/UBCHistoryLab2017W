THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS. yvTheactof congress approved Aug. 7,1882, authorized tlie removal to the United states of the bodies of Lieutenant Commander G. W.'De Long and his companions of the Jeatt nette expedition. The removal has been suc be'e'sfully accomplished. The remains were fcaken from their grave in tiib'.Lena 'delta, in Maivh, 18$$. but were .letained at.'Yakutsk until the following winter, the season being too far advanced to admit of their immediate transportation. They arrived at New York Feb. 20, 1884, where they were received with suitable honors. In pursuance of the Joii),t resolution of congress approved Feb, 13 1884,-a naval expedition waisj fitted: for.-thp raltefv of Lietot fiL W.

June 22, a fortnight earlier tlian' any vessel had be fore attained that point. On the same day it crossed over to Cape. Sabine, where Lieut.

They were appro priately received at Portsmouth, N. H., on Ajjg. 1, and at-New York on Aug. 8. One of the bodies was landed at the former place. The others" were'put on shore at Governor's island, and with the exception of one, which was interred in the national cemetery, were forwarded thence to the destination in dicated by friends. The,'organization' and sonduct of the relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contributed to its success. In this, the last of the state mes- hs-.., »•. sages that I shall have the honor to transmit Si' "to thei.congress of the United States, I can not too strongly urge oh its attention"'the duty of restoring our navy as rapidly as pos sible to the high state of efficiency which ft: H? fei Eormerly characterized it As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancicd se surity may at any time be disturbed, it is plain that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by consid erations Of use, economy, of just rearard for our future tranquility and of true apprecia tion of the dignity and honor of this repub lic. POSTAL. AFFAIRS. THE EEDUCTTON IN LETTER POSTAGE. The-report of the postmaster general ac quaints you with the present condition and needs of the postal service. It discloses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of letter postage, as recommended in my message of December, 1882 and effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recommendation of this reduction was based upon the belief that the actual falling off in receipts from letter post age for the year immediately succeeding the shange of rate would be $3,000,000. It has proved to be only $2,275,000. This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former volume by natural increases of sealed correspondence. I confidently repeat, therefore, the recom mendation .of my last annual message, that the single rate of postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wherever the pay ment of two cents is now required bv law. The double rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in operation, and It appears that at these offices the in crease in tax upon local letters defrays the cost not only of its own collection and delivery, but of the collection and deliv ery of all other mail matter, and this is an irregularity that ought no longer to exist I approve the recommendation of the post master general that the unit of weight in the eating of first-class matter should be one Dunce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. In. view of the statistics furnished by the de partment," it may be' well doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the sonvenience of the public is beyond dispute. Che free delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and the total number 51 offices in. which it is now in operation is 159. Experience- shows, that its adoption wader proper conditions is equally an accom modation to the public and an advantage to the postal service. It is more than self-sustaining, and, for the reasons urged by the postmaster general, may P0P®tJy be-extended. It is the opinion of inat omcer that It is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters, in free-delivery offices •nay be secured by.-Jthe payment of extra ordinary postaga This Boheme may be made effective by the employment of a special stamp, whose cost shall be commen surate with the expense of the entire extra service. In some of the-large cities private express companies.have undertaken toout itrip the government mail carriers by afford ing, for the prompt transmission of letters, better facilities than have hitherto been at the command of the postoffice.. It has always been the policy of the government to discourage such enterprises, and in no better way can that policy be maintained than in supplying the public with the most efitdent service that, with due regard to its own best interests,''can be furnished for ite recom mendation 

DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE. raOPOSKD BXVOBKB. The attorney general renews the reoom mendation contained in his report ot last year, touching the fees of witnesses and Jurors. He favors radical change in the fee bill, the adoption,of a system by .which at torneys and marshals ofthe XJnited States should be compensated solely by salaries, and the 'erection by/Urn government of a penitentiary for the bdnflnement of offend ers against its laws. Wfj INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. BZOBETABY TX^IiEB'S BKCOHHBNQATIONS. Of the yaried governmental .concerns in charge of thd interior department, the re port of its secretary presents an interesting .summary.. Among the topics deserving par ticular Attention I refer yon to his observa tions respecting our Indian affairs, the pre eniptiou and timber culture acts, the failure of :'railroad companies to.taketitle to lands 'granted by the government ithd the opera tions of the pension office, the patent office, the census bureau and bureau of education. Allusion haB been made already to the cir cumstance that both as between different Indian tribes and as between the Indians and the whites, the past year has befen one of unbioken peace In this circumstance the president is glad to find justification for the policy of the government in dealing with the Indian question, and confirmation of views which were fully expressed in his first com munication to the Forty-seventh congress. The secretary urges a new enactment of a statute for the punishment of crimes com mitted on Indian reservations, and recom mends the passage of the bill now pending in the house of representatives, for the pur chase of a district of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these measures are worthy of approval. I concur with him also in advising the repeal of the pre-emption law, the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed giants to railroads, and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under such sruarantee as ctinii in sure its ultimate payment 

PTA|I. STRINGENT JIEASURES :SUG0$8$ED. Thfe report of the Utah commission will be read with interest It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention .-Mid punishment of polygamy in that terri tory. I still believe that if that abominable practice cannot be suppressed by iaw, it can only be dealt with by the mpst rascal legis lation dohRVent with the restraints of the constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that congress assume absolute political con trol of the Territory of Utah, and provide th® appoihtment of a commission, with such governmental powers as in its judg ment may justly and wisely be put into their hands. FOREIGN TRADE. HOW TO EXTEND IT. In the course of this communication refer ence has more than once been made to the policy of this government as regards the ex tension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare .the, general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direction. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated: We are a people rich in mechanical pursuits and .•fertile in invention we covet a vastextent of territory, rich in agricultural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture. We have a system of productive establishments more than sufficient to supply our demands. The wages of labor are nowhere so great The scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual qual ities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs of the government These are elements from which it is sought to de vise a scheme by which, without unfavora bly changing the condition of workingmen, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets pro vided for the sale, beyond our borders, of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprise. The problem is. complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or re form. The countries of the American conti nent and the adjacent islands are for the United States-the natural market of supply and demand. It is from them that we should obtain what we 'do not producc, or do riot Xroduce in sufficiency, and it is to them that surplus productions of our- fields, our mills, and our workshops should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition, four paths of policy seem to point to this end. First, a series of reciprocal comnicrcial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between the United States and them an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of these treaties should the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce, in return for the admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of 'our own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply on those goods carried under the flag of the parties to the contract the removal on both sides from vessels so privileged of all tonnage dues and national imports, so that their vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and tbose of the other contracting parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade. The removal or reduction of burdens on the exported products of those countries' coming with in the benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of the technicalities, restrictions, and specialties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered. Secondly, tbe establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing, permitting the relinquishment of oonsulax fees for not only as respects vessels under the national flag, bbt also as respects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties. Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United Statea Fourthly, the establishment of an uniform -currency baeis for the countries of America, so that the coined products of our. mines may circulate' on equal terms through out the whole system of commonwealths. This would require a monetary union of America, whereby the output of the bnllion producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver, .ulation, wealth and commercialneeds of eacH? As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock, the surplus production if our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step taken toward the general remone tization of silver. To the accomplishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed, and the favor with which this enlarged policy has thus far been received warrants the belief that its operations will, ere lonjr, embrace all or nearly all the coun tries of this hemisphere. It is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration should be. applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we npr the other American states are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in re turn a better market for our supplies of food, of raw material and of the manufactures in whlchwe exceLi It seemc to me that many of the embarrassing ele ments in the great national conflict between protection ana free trade may thus be turned to good account that the revenue may be reduced so as no longer to overtax:the peo ple:! .the protective duties may.bd retairiec without becoming, burdensome: thafr otu shipping interests may be judiciously en couraged, the currency fixed on a firm basis and above all such a unity of interests estab lished among the states of the American'sys tem as will be of great and evM,increasing advantage to them alL All treaties in the line-of this polioy which' have been nego tiated, or are in process of being negotiated,' contain a provision deemed to be requisite tinder the clause of the constitution limiting to the house of representatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue. THE 

CIVIL SEHVICE. WOBX OF THE IAW AND COMMISSION. On the 29th of February last I transmitted to congress the first annual report of the civil service commission, together with com munications from the heads of the several revenue, departments of the government, respecting the working of the law under which the comission •has been acting. The good results therein foreshadowed have been more than realized. The system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful public ser varits, and in protecting the appointing offi cers of the government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment. The law has had the unqualified support of the president and of the heads of the several de partments, and the members of the commis sion have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly be submitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend them-, selves to the executive and the commission ers charged with the administration. MISCEEXANEOiaS, 

BANKRUPTCY—THE CHOLERA. In view of the general persistent demand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law- I hope that the differences which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present- ses sion. The pestilence which for the past two years has been raging in the countries of the East recently made its appearance in European ports with which we are in con stant communication. The then secretary of the treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation Of the president, issued., certain regulations restricting, and for a time prohibiting the importation of rags apd the admission of baggage of immigrants and of travelers ar riving from infected quarters. Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation ofthe present secretary, that congress take action in the premises, and I also recommend the immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epi demic, and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shores. 

DISTBIOT OF COLUMBIA. The annual report of the commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the opera tions of the several departments of its mu nicipal government, and I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation, especially commending Buch as relate to a revisipn of the civil and criminal code, the performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the construction and occupation of wharves along the river front and the erection of a suitable building for district offices. I rec ommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, the general of the armies of the United States and twice president of the nation, congress confer upon him a suitable pension. The measures that Reem to me necessary and expedient 1 have now. in obeyance to the constitution, recom mended for your adoption. As respects others of no less importance I shall content myself with renewing the recommendations already made to the congress without restat ing the grounds upon which such recommen dations were based: The preservation of forests on the public domain the granting of government "aid for popular education the amendment of the federal constitution so as to make effective the disapproval by the president of particular items in appopri ation bills the enactment of statutes in re gard to the filling of vacancies in the presi dential office, and the determining of vexed questions respecting presidential inability, are measures which may justly receive your serious consideration. As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the national legislature, with whom I have been brought into per sonal and official intercourse, iny sincere ap preciation of their unfailing1 courtesy, and of their harmonious co-operation with the executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation and to my fellow citizens generally I acknowl edge a deep sense of obligation for the sup port which they have accorded me in the ad ministration of the executive department of the government [Signed] 

CHESTER A ARTHUR. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 1,1884. A VERITABLE MASCOT. The special correspondent of the Buffalo Courier has discovered a mascot which he describes as follows: During the trial of the great grape sugar suit of John J. Alberger' and Horace Williams against Cicero A Ham-' lin and others, which under a change of venue came before the courts of Genesee county in December, 1880, President-elect Cleveland spent ten days in Batavia as one of the attorneys for the plaintiff. Mr. Cleve land stopped at a local hotel, and during his stay was given a seat at one of the dining-room tables which he retained at every meal. One of the dining-room girls took particular pains to see that he was 6erved promptly and well, and whenever Mr, Cleveland's name has been brought be fore the pubUo as a candidate she has been enthusiastic in his support In October, 1882, when the adjourned judicial district convention was held here, the Hon. L. Lewis of Buffalo, one of the candidates for the nomination, made the hotel his headquarters during the deadlock that ensued,and occupied the same seat at the same table that Gov. Cleveland had retained, and was waited upon by the same girl The result of the conven tion was Judge Lewis' nomination and sub sequent election. During the recent Bepub lican congressional convention here land lord Collins, of the St James, was telling Judge Sawyer of Orleans, whose name was presented for nomination, of the good fortune of the gentlemen who.had occupied the seat referred to in his dining room, and though Judge Sawyer's chances of receiving the honor aid not seem to be great, he was given the chair at the table that had seated the other gentlemen. The days of the con vention wore away without any perceptible improvement in Sawyer's chances, until the 577th ballot, when the long and acrimonious contest was brought to a close by the selec tion of Judge Sawyer, and he has been elect ed by a round majority. This dining room girl, considering the good luck that has at tended the aspirants to office who have oc cupied the seat at her table, lays claim to being a mascot Good fortune has surely attended the three gentlemen whose names are mentioned. 11". OF tHU s? 8ENAT& —The opening''session of the senate was preceded by a lively half-hour of hand shaking and gossip between senators and their friends. Precisely .at noon the president of the senate called the body to order and prayer was offered. On motion of Mr. Logan the secreta ry-was instructed to inform the house that the senate was ready to proceed" to bus iness. Messrs. Sherman and Garland were appointed a committee to inform the president that the senate was ready to receive any communication he might be pleased to make. The secretary read the-credentials of William P. Sheffield, appointed to fill the va cancy caused by the death of Senator Anthony. The Presidents message was received, and when the reading was concluded, Mr. Aldrich, in a few feeling remarks, made a formal an nouncement of the death of Senator Anthony, andthe senate adjourned HOU3E.—Promptly at noon the speaker's gavel called the house to order. After prayer the speaker directed the clerk .,to call tlie roll The roll call disclosed the presence of 222 mem bers, and the clerk was directed to inform the sedate that the house was ready to proceed to business. Tbe speaker appointed Messrs. Ban flail and Cox (N. x.) a committee to wait upon the' president, in conjunction with a similar committee from the senate, arid inform him that congress was ready to receive any com munication he might be pleased to make. The messace was referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the Union, and, with accompanying documents,ordered printed SENATE.—Mr. Sheffield was sworn in as sen ator from Rhode Island' A resolution was offored for an investigation of all leases of land in the Indian Territory, and debated at considerable length. HOUSE.—Mr. Follett. of Ohio as a question of privilege, presentod the following preamble and resolution: ,' I do impeach Lot Wright, United States mar shal for the southern district of Ohio, of lu^h crimes and misdemeanors. I charge him with usurpation of power and violation of law, that he appointed a large number of general and spccial deputy marshals to serve at several voting preciuots in Cincinnati, at the election for members of congress, on the 14th o' Octob er, 1SS-1, and armed the said deputy marshals with pistols, and other deadly weapons, said to have been furnished by the war department. Resolved, That the committee on expendi tures of the department of justice be required and directed, as soon as the name can reason able be done, to investigate such charges and report to the house. I. An exciting debate followed, participated in by Messrs. Follett and Converse, of Ohio Cox of New York Reagan ,of Texas Barksdale of Missouri, and others on the Democratic side, while Messrs. Kiefer and Jud Taylor, of Ohio I Hiscock of New York, and Reid of Maine pre sented the Republican view of the case. Nono of the latter opposed the resolutions or the in vestigation contemplated by it The resolution was adopted. How a Chiiiaman Gets into Busi ness. Wong Cliiu Foo, the Chinese ex journalist, tells how his countrymen get into business in America He says: "One of my race arrives here with no money and in debt to his friends or to the banker for the steamer and railroad fare. He generally engages himself as a greenhorn or apprentice to some suc cessful laundryman. Although the compensation is small ($4 or $5per week and board),for the six months ov one year of his contract, he learns the business, pays his debts, and gains a good name for integrity and capability. At the end of his term, if he is a skilled workman, he can either secure first-class wages ($18 per week), or open a laundry of hiH own. The latter is his usual course. He may see, for example, a laundry for sale for $600 whose looks and location he likes, and he himself has but $50 to his name. He goes to Mott street and there on the bulletin board puts up a notice for a 'whey,"or syndicate of twelve men with $50 each to meet him at a certain time and place, the meeting is bail, and if he is regarded as honest and capable the requisite $550 is given to him, he in return acknowledging tho indebtedness, andtpromising to pay a certain interest on t-lie money advanced (generally 20 per cent, per annum). This money is paved back in monthly installments, so that at the end of the year the borrower is free from debt, his credit unimpaired and the laundry ab solutely his own." The Father of the British Army.' In the late General England has died not only the "doyen" of the Koyal Ar tillery, but also the "father" of the British Army. As the deceased, who was in his ninety-seventh year, was the old est officer in her Majesty's service, his death surely merits more than the fev lines of obituary notice with which the papers have recorded his end. He had obtained his first commission "by com mand of His Majesty King George III." as far back as May, 1805,,and within a few weeks of his name apearing in the official "Gazette" was ordered with his battery to the "Weser, where he took pact in the now almost forgotten opera tions which were undertaken in co-op eration with the Russian forces in North Germany. Of this bloodless campaign,which ended in the withdrawal of our forces, General England was the last survivor. In 1806 he was sent to South Africa to share in our operation against the Dutch, who were at that time in possession of the Cape Colony. From the Cape he went to South America, and was at the investment of Montevid eo, our unfortunate attack upon Buenos Ayres, and other illstarred operations, which ended in the withdrawal of our forces from the Eio de la Plata. Of this campaign, too, he was the solitary survivor. General England finally shared in the closing scenes of the Pen insular war, and was at the battle of Vittoria and siege of San Sebastian. He was not at Waterloo, and saw no further service after the peace of 1815, Jjut has survived until the memories of the operations in which he had shar ed had almost passed atfay. His death makes us regret that one of tho last of Tie "Iron Duke's" army has left us..
