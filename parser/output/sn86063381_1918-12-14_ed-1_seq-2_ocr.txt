Nolan will be the speaker of the next house of representatives. This was assured last week when a majority of the members met in St. Paul at the call of Elmer Adams of Fergus Falls and pledged themselves to the candi- dacy of the Hennepin county man. The gathering was pri- marily for the purpose of organizing against any control by the Nonpartisan league forces and concluded with the accepV ance of Mr. Nolan's speakership candidacy, as the first necessary step in combining against Townley and his bunch. Quite a few anti-league talks were made and a number of the members accused of league connections and sympathies gave a vigorous denial. It was decided to organize the house on a strict loyalty basis and to tolerate nothing of a bolsheviki nature. The meet- ing and its action was in measure out of the ordinary as it represented the settlement of speakership and organization hostilities' the earliest in years. Secretary "Newt" Baker was the only member of the presi- dential cabinet who did not get out on the stump and bawl for a democratic congress, and it is reported that his r#ason for exhibiting such remarkable self-effacement was an .ambi- tion which centers both eyes on 1920. Baker filling himself with presidential affatus recalls the old fable of the bull-frog who attempted to match the cow for size. He jes' nachally blew up. According to a dispatch from Philadelphia, railroad heads are against McAdoo's railroad plan. Well, didn't the president in his message to congress before he sailed say he was unable to solve the problem and believed it should be solved by con- gress.? "Mc" essays to do something that his father-in-law wouldn't tackle. But he has resigned because, he says, he's got to make a living. ZQ, Postmaster General Burleson has just made public a letter in which Theodore N. Vail, head of the Bell telephone system, announces an invention that will permit four telephone con- versations on a single line at the same time. That's nothing. On some lines hereabouts more than four people talk at the same time. Old King Cotton seems to have been the only autocrat who came out of the war worth a great deal more than when he went in.

In many large banks, the bond departments are being reorganized, and among new features contemplated is a greater abundance of bond issues in the lower denominations. The innovations arise from the conviction of the directorates that they will soon have to deal with a new type of investor the type that has never invested before. Those Who have been in the habit of putting their savings into bonds hardly realize how widespread an ignorance has existed regarding this class of investment. But any Liberty bond salesman has realized it by this time. He has worked to exhaustion answering questions which he thought anybody could answer. "What's a coupon?" "Can you buy groceries with it?" "Can you sell a bond after you have bought it?" "Must you take it to Washington to sell it?" These mysteries are now cleared away, and most people know that you don't save bond coupons up to a total of eleven hundred and then trade them in lor premium coffee-pot* or tobacco-humidors. The Liberty bond campaigns have eluci- dated these thingsand a few others. It has taught that the bond department of ,a state or national bank is widely different from a fraudulent bucket shop. Banks,of standing cannot afford to offer doubtful secur- ities for sale they prosper or decline in proportion as their customers win or lose. One cheated customer could set up a squeal that would wreck the institution. The movies have fed us to repletion on Wall street ro- mances in which some sinister broker always plays a leading part, and those who get their ideas from movies felt more inclined than ever to hide their savings in mattresses. But they can do better now. According to General DuPont, it will take about two years to demobilize the American army. There will be plenty of work for our soldiers to do in France after peace has been signed, so that there is no fear of a period of unemployment at home. On the contrary, the work of reconstruction will mean a tremendous circulation of money and its distribution into the hands of the masses in America, and the more readily it is invested by them in sound securities the faster will capital be available for expanding reconstructive programs Jto more ambitious dimensions. Peace will bring with it a greater stimulous to saving among the wage earners than ever inspired them before. And here is the keystone of national prosperity. -L- THE BEMIDJI DAILY PIONEER AT THE THEATERS GEORGE WALSH TONIGHT, George Walsh's an&es *on the Lsoreen produce a conUfBuouat, round of laughter in "On, The Jump." a timely patriotic production showing tonight at the-Rex theater* The comedian it a .Liberty Bond salesman, and also arrestathe master Gasman spy who is directing sabot age work, anduunjiarths the |$0,OOQi- 003 fund withrwhJch Germany honejg to establish, a vchain of .Americas* nawsBftpera^o #way pubUeiOPiniojfc Alia* HoweUt^jtvill aleo&be seen?4n one of: her laugh successes, "Autam n4acs two reels.
