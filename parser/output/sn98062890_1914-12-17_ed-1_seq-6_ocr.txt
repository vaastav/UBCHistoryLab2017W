TRANSIENT FARM HANDS ROB HOME OF EMPLOYER Ipswich, S. D., Doc. 14.—The Ed munds county authorities are looking for two wandering rarm hands, giving their names as Ryan and claiming to be brothers, who burglarized the home of Robert Jones, a prominent Edmunds county farmer, for whom they worked for a period of 13 days, and then dis appeared. Miss Lilly Jones, daughter of the farmer, is a school teacher, and she had the savings from her school work, amounting to $103, in the house. The two farm hands discovered this and evidently decided to secure the money and make their getaway, for when their absence was discovered the money also was found to be missing. The money was the llrst the young woman had earned. The telephone anil telegraph lines have been liberally utilized in the effort to capture tlif burglars, but thus far no trace of then has been found. AFTER TRIP FROM NORWAY, ALIGHTS AT WRONG TOWN Kulton, S. D., Dec. 14.—Traveling from Christiana, Norway, to South Da kola, Miss Martha Anderson was doomed to a bitter disappointment at what she for a time thought was the end of her long and lonesome journey. She arrived in Fulton expecting a sis ter, who lives in South Dakota, to meet her at the train, as she had advised her of her coming. But when she alighted from the train the sister failed to ap pear. She made her way to a hotel, where an investigation disclosed that she should have been sent to Fanlkton, S. p.. instead of Fulton, the mistake having been made by the railway of ficials through misreading her railway ticket. A telegram was sent to the sis ter. Tl)e young traveler's funds were completely exhausted when she reached Fulton, and the business men raised a fund and sent her to Faulkton, where she was reunited with her sister, who was at the train to meet her.

It is stated that Kinslee was given dangerous. This time his employei fearing trouble, shut him in the barn while he went up town to secure the town marshal to place the man in Jail. At this time, it is stated, young Burgett, appeared at the barn, when the drink-crazed man shot and killed him. The murderer was lodged in the Mar shall county jail at Britton. He will be tried, it is expected, at the January term of state circuit'court for Marshal county. UNEXPECTED MARKET FOUND FOR PROMOTION BONDS Veblen, S. D„ Dec. 12.—There is great rejoicing among Veblen holders of sec ond mortgage bonds of the Fairmount & Veblen railroad, over the announce ment that a buyer has been found fot a quantity of the bonds at 50 per cent of their par value. When the railroad project was broached, two years ago, a large quantity of second mortgage bonds were purchased by Veblen peo ple. with the understanding on their part, which was carefully explained to them by the promoters, that the likeli hood of the bonds ever attaining a marketable value was exceedingly slim. The bonds found a ready market here, however, because of the anxiety of the people to get a railroad, the purchasers looking upon the matter as a bonus for the road, rather than a real busi ness deal. The fact that buyers have been found for a portion of the bonds, within two years of the investment, therefore, came as a delightful sur prise. FIRST GOOD ROADS CONGRESS AT UNIVERSITY. DEC. 21-23 Vermilion, S. D„ Dec. 12.—The tJni versity of South Dakota has received words of commendation from farmers business men. and good roads enthusi asts, over the entire state, for the good roads congress to be held at Vermilion, on December 21, 22 and 23. T!iis is due to the fact that good roads f.re being discussed In every part of the country today, and that South Dakotans are very receptive when matters of com munity and state betterment are to be discussed. Prominent among the lec turers will be 10. C. Issenhuth, N. O. Monserud, and B. M. Wood, members of the state highway commission State Engineer H. M. Derr. Prof. H. O. Sol berg, of the state college: Commission er of Immigration Chas. McCaffree E. K. Mather, a contracting engineer Prof. T. R. Agg, of Iowa state college, and several others. At the present time there are 200. 000 miles of highway in South Dakota and only 29,000 miles of good dirt roads, and but 1.000 miles of hard surfaced roads. There are less than 20 road as sociations in this state that are doing active work. It is for the purpose of increasing the number of miles of good roads, of raising the number of road associations, and of creating a general interest in road construction that the first annual road congress will be held at the university. 

SETTLERS GET VERDICT IN WATER RIGHTS CONTROVERSY bead, S. D., Dee. 12.—Settlers under the government reclamation project have just won an important decision in the United States court of appeals which sustained the decision of Judge Elliott in the United States district court of this state. The suit was the Belle Fourche Water Users' associa tion against Frank Magruder, project engineer, and others, and arose from the defendants shutting off the water supply of the settlers for nonpayment of water rents and other differences. The suit was fought by tiie govern ment on the. grounds that Magruder and the other officials were only nom inal defendants and that the plaintiffs really sought to restrain the govern ment from proper supervision of its water rights. This decision is expected to, bring about a readjustment of the water rent problem and make it easier for the settler on government irriga tion projects. "Lead and Denver attor neys conducted the case. SALEM YOUTHS CONFESS TO RECENT PETTY BURGLARIES Salem, S. D., Dec. 12.—After an ex tended period of watchful waiting the peace authorities have broken the backbone of a gang of young bandits here. Four members of the gang have been caught and sentenced, following confessions of participating in a couple of recent minor burglaries. Arthur Koethe and Frank Schneider, sen tenced to pay a fine of $60 each and serve 30 days in jail, have been taken to Sioux Falls to serve their terms Henry Podratz and John Brune, sen tenced to 30 days in jail, were given a suspension of sentence, pending good behavior. Several months ago the boy bandits robbed a local pool hall and at that time bloodhound were put on the trail, but without' results. A few days ago they rifled the cash drawer in a local blacksmith shop. VESSEY RECOVERING FROM INJURIES IN ACCIDENT Pierre. S. D., Dec. 11.—Word has been received here that Robert S.

Washington Special: President Wil Bon's message to congress was as fol lows Gentlemen of the Congress: The session upon which you are novr entering will be the closing session of the Sixty-third congress, a congress, I ven ture to say. which will long be remem bered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal response to the thought and needs of the country. I should like in this address to review the notable record and try to make adequate assessment of it but no doubt we stand too near the work that has been done and are our selves too much part of it to play the part of historians toward it. Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past. While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people, we did with the best that was in us, whether of character or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence in the prin ciples upon which we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult undertaking but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now an established part of the legislation of tho country. Its usefulness, its effects will disclose themselves in experience. What chiefly strikes us now. as we look about us durinK these closing- flays of a year which will be forever memorable in the history Of the world, is that we face new tasks, have been facing them these six months, must face them in the months to come—face them without partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a common duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herseil' and to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and anxious. Must Help Europe. War has interrupted the means of trade not only, but also the processes of pro duetion. In Rurope it is destroying men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and appalling. There is reason to fear that the time is near, if it be not already at hand, when sev eral,of the countries of ISurope will find It difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto been alwav.s easily able to do—many essential and funda mental things. At any rate, they will need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them hefore and we should he ready, more fit and ready than we have ever been. It is of equal consequence that the nations whom Kurope has usually sup plied with innumerable articles of man ufacture and commerce of which they are in constant need and without which their economic development halts and stands still can now get only a small part of what they formerly imported and eager!v look to us t(, supply their all but emptv markets. This is particular!v true or our own. neighbors, the states, great and small, of Central and South America, Their lines of trade have hitherto run chietly athwart the seas, not to our ports, but to the ports of Great Britain and of the older continent of ICurope. I do not stop to inquire why, or to make anv coniinent 011 probable causes. What in terests us just now is not the explana tion but the fact, and our dutv and op portunity in the presence of it. Here are markets which we must snnniv, mid we must find the means of 'action. The United States, this great peopiu for whom wo speak and act. should lie ready, as never before, to serve itself and to serve itself and to serve mankind readv with its resources, its energies, it forces of production and its means of distribu tion. Urges Merchant Marine. It is a very practical matter, a mat ter of ways and means. We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them? And, if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We are not fuilv readv: neither have we the means of distribu tion. Wo are willing, hut we are not ful ly able. We have the wish to serve and to serve greatly, generously but We are not prepared as we should be. We are not ready to mobilise our re sources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediatelv and at their best, without delay and without waste. To scpak plainly, we have grossly erred In the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our mer chant marine. And now, when we need ships, we have not fjot them. We have year after year debated, without end or conclusion, the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores and for ests and water powers of our national do main In the rich states of the west, when we should have acted and they are still locked up. The key is still turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thou sands of vigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also, even the eastern states, where we have worked and planned for generations, is still not used as it might be, because we will and we won't because the laws wo have made do not Intelligently balance en couragement against restraint. We with hold by regulation. 1 have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omissions, even at this short session of a congress which would certainly seem to have clone nil the work that could reasonably be expected of it. Tho time and the cir cumstances are extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also. Conservation Measures. Fortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, the one to unlock, with proper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, the other to encourage the use of tl.e navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power, have already passed the House of Representatives and arc ready for immediate consideration and action by the Senate. With the deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In them both we turn our hacks upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine policy of 'use and conservation. In the best sense of those words. We ewe the one measure not only to the people of that great country for whose free and systematic development, as it seems to mo, our legislation has done so little, but also to the people of the, nation as a whole and we as clearly owe the other In fulfillment of our rep-ated promises that the water power of the country should in fact as well as in name be put at the disposal of great industries which can make economical and prolitable use or it, the right of tho public being adequately guarded the while, and monopoly in the use prevented. To have begun such meas ures and not completed them would in deed mar the record of th:s great con gress very seriously. I hope and confi dently believe that they will be com pleted. And there is another great piece of legislation which awaits and should re ceive the sanction of the Senate: I mean the bill which gives a larger measure of Belf-govermr.ent to the people of the Phil ippines. 1-low better, in this time of anx ious questioning and perplexed police, could we show our confidence in the prin ciples of liberty, as the source as well as the expression of life, how better eonlct we demonstrate our own self-possession and steadfastness in the courses of jus tice and disinterestedness than by thus go ing calmly forward to fultill our promises to a dependent people, who will now look more anxiotuly than ever to see whether we have indeed the liberalitv. the un selfishness. the courage, the faith we have boasted and professed. I can not believe that the Senate will let this great meas ure of constructive justice awslt the •RIU 5 1? congress?. Its passage .mcnov It is ws PO.\(,N 

HAVE fc sc carry our nV.V,? ,trlarkct! tne merchant marine of the country, to 1 retrace the steps by which we have, it seems almost deliberately, withdrawn our flag from the seas, except where, here and there, a ship of war is hidden to carry it or some wandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and Involve many detailed items of legislation, and the trade which we ought Immediately to handle would disappear or find other channels while we debated the items. The ease is not unlike that which con fronted us when our own continent was to be opened up to settlement and indus try, and we needed long lines of railway, extended means of transportation pre pared beforehand, if development was not to lag intolerably and wait interminably. We lavishly subsidized the building of transcontinental railroads. We look back upon that with regret now, because the subsidies led to many scandals of which we are ashamed: but we know that the railroads had to be built, and if we had it to do over again we should of course build them, but in another way. There fore I propose another way of providing the means of transportation, which must precede, not tardily follow, the develop ment of our trade with our neighbor states of America. It may seem a reversal of the natural order of things, but it is true, that tile routes of trade must be actually opened—by many ships and regular sail ings and moderate charges—before streams of merchandise will flow freely and profitably through them. Hence the pending shipping bill, dis cussed at the inst session but: as yet passed by neither House. Tn my judgment such legislation is imperatively needed and can not wisel be postponed. The government must open these gates of trade, and open them wide: open them before it is al together profitable to open them, or al together reasonable to ask private capital to open them at a venture. It is not a question of the government monopolizing the field. Tt should take action to make it certain that transportation at reason abe rates will he promptly provided, even where the carriage is not at first profit able: and then, when the carriage has be come sufficiently profitable to attract and engage private capital, and engage it in abundance, the government ought to with draw. I very earnestly hope that the congrers will be of this opinion, and that both Houses will adopt this exceedingly important bin. Wants Rural Credits. The great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it is a mat ter of deep regret, that the difficulties of tlie subject have seemed to render it Im possible to complete a bill for passa-ge at this session. But It can not be perfected yet, and therefore there are no other con structive measures the necessity for which I will at this time call your attention to: but 1 would be negligent of a very mani fest duty were 1 not to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the pro posed convention for safety at sea. awaits its confirmation and that'the limit fixed in the convention itself for its acceptance is the last day of the present month. The conference in whfc.h this convention origi nated was called by the United Stales the representatives of the United States niayed a very influential part indeed in framing the provisions of the proposed convention and those provisions are in themselves for the most part admirable, ft would hardly be consistent with the part we have played in the whole matter let it drop and go by the board as if forgotten and neglected. It was ratified May last by the German government and in August by the parliament of Great liltain. It marks a most hopeful and de cided advance In international civilization. We should show our earnest good, faith in a great matter by adding our own ac ceptance of it. There is another matter of which must make special mention. If I am to discharge my conscience, lert it shou'd escape your attention. If may seem a very small thing. Tt affects oniy a. single item of ippropri.-uion. But. many human lives and many great enterprises hang upon it. It is the matter of making adequate provision for the survey an.l charting of our coasts, tt is '.mmrdiatelv pressing and exigent :n connection with the immense coast line 3f .Alaska, a coast line greater than that of the T'nited States themselves, though it is also very important indeed with re Taivl to the older coasts of the continent. We can not use our great Alaskan do main, ships will not ply thither, if those coasts and their many hidden dangers are not thoroughly surveyed and charted. The work is incomplete ut almost every point. °,hips ard lives have been lost in thread ing what were supposed to be well known main channels. We have not provided •ideqnate. vessels or adequate machinery for the survey and charting. We have used oM vessels that were not big enough or strong enough and which wore so near ly unseaworthy that our Inspectors would "ot have allowed private owners to send them to sea. This is a matter which, as I have said, seems smsll. but is in reality very great. Its importance has only to be looked into to be appreciated. Economy In Government. Before I close may 1 say a few words upon two topics, much discussed out of doors, upon which it Is highly important that our judcTv«»ntj should be clear, defi nite, and steadfast? One of these is economy in government expenditures. The dutv of conon-iy is not debatable. It is manifest and impera tive. In the appropriations we pass we are spending the money of the great peo ple whose servants we are—not our own. We are trustees anl responsible stewards in tho spending. The only thing debatshle and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and purpose clear is the kind of economy demanded of us. 1 as sert with the greatest confidence that the people of the United States are not jenl '»is of the amount their government costs if they are sure that, they sret .,-hat they need and desire for be outlay, that the money is being srort for objects of which tbev improve, and that it is being applied with good business sense and manage ment. Governments grow, piecemeal, both in •heir tasks 

.'IIKI in the means by which those tasks are to be performed, and very '""•w governments are organized. I venture to say, as w'se and eXMcric'ced business men would org.-mire them if they had a "lean sheet of paprr to write upon. Cer tainly the government of the United State is not. think t'nnt it is generally agreed thai there should he it systematic reorganization and reassembling of its parts so as to secure greater efficiency and eff^'t corsiderohie savings in ex •-.0T"o. Hnt the amount of money saved In that wav would. believe, though r loubt considerable In Itself, running. It may be. i-to the millions, be relatively sma'l—small. mean, in proportion to the total necessary outlays of the govern ment. It would be t'-orotighlv worth ef "eeting, :v. every saving would, great or -'-nail. Our duty is not altered by the scale of saving, ^vt my point is that the nco-de of the United States do not Wish to cirtail the rettvities of this government' they wish, rather, to enlarge them: and with every enlargement, with the mere n-owth. indeed, of tbp country itself, there must come, of course, the inevitable In crease of expense. The sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful studv ••rd assessment of the tasks to bo per formed: and th» money spent ought to be made to yield the boot nosrible returns in efficiency and achievement. And, like rood st^'artls. we should so account for every dollar of our orm-orriet'rns ris to make it nerfeetly evident what it was 3p*u* for end ia what wav it was spent.

I have tried to know what America is, what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and hold deal'. I hope that some of their finer passions are in my own heart— some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to this government and which have made the voice of this peo ple a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and that, speaking my own thoughts, I shall, at least, in part, speak theirs also, how ever faintly and inadequately, upon this vital matter. Afraid of Nobody. We are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and candid inter pretation of realities can say that there Is reason to fear that from any quar ter our independence or the Integrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power of any other nation we are incapable of. AVe are not jealous of rival ry in the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own lives as wo will but also to let live. We are, indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet tho pos sessions of none, desire the overthrow of none. Our friendship can bo accepted and is accepted without reservation, be cause it is offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever ques tion or suspect: Therein lies our great ness. We are the champions of peace and of concord. And we should be very jealous of this distinction which we have sought to earn, .lust now we should be particularly jealous of it, because it is our dearest present hope that this char acter and reputation may presently, in God's providence, bring us an oppor tunity such as lias seldom been vouch safed any nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in tho world and reconciliation and a healing settle ment of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship of na tions. This is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession, our in fluence by preserving our ancient prin ciples of action. From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military estn.blishinents. We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals, we never shall have, a large standing army. If asked "are you ready to defend yourselves?" we reply, "most assuredly, tx the xitmost." and yet wo shall not turn America into a military camp. We. will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves. There is another sort of energy in us. It will know how to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the spread of the con flagration very definite and certain and adequate indeed. Favors Strong Army. Let us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing- we can do or will do. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor yet upon a re serve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our accustomed principles and prac tices. to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the train ing may be made, familiar with the use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should encour age such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men will learn to value. It is right that we should provide it not only, but that we should make it as attractive as possible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek tho physical development they need, for mere health's sake, if for nothing more. Every means by which such things can be stimulated is legitimate, and such a method smacks of true American ideas. It is right, too. that the National duard of the states should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the established policy of our gov ernment. And this, also, not because the time or occasion specially calls for such measures, but because it should be our constant policy to make these provisions for our national peace and safety. More, than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and character of Our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit me to say, would mean merely that we bad lost our self-posses =ion. that we had been thrown off our bal ance by a war with which we have noth ing to do, whose causes can not touch us, whose very existence affords us oppor tunities o" friendship and disinterested service which should make us ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful prep aration for trouble. This Is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a gov ernment like ours were raised up, the op portunity not only to sneak but actually to embody and exemnlifv the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord which Is based on justice and fair and generous dealing. For Stronq Navy. A powerful navy we have always re garded an our proper and natural means of defense and it has always been of de fense that we have thought, never of ag gression or of conquest. But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas,. In the future as In the past and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us just what kind we should construct —and when will they be right for 10 years together, if the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and uses contlues to change as we have seen It change under our very eyes in these last few months? But I turn away from the subject. It is not new. There Is no new need to dis cuss It. We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst us "T^Ttf,1.vfj^\ we are be in time of peace so long as we re tain our present political principles and institutions. And what is it that ft is suggested we should be prepared to do, To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do that, and shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our people away from their necessary tasks to render compul sorv military service in times of peace. are nervoxis and excited. We shall easily end sensibly agree unon a policy of de fense. The question has not changed its •ispects because the times are not normal. Our policy will not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we" will pursue at all seasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world, the abiding friendship of states, and the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal. Let there be no miscon ception. The country has been misin formed. We have rot been negligent of national defense. We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting upon Us. We shall le »rn and profit by the lesson jot every experience and every new circum stance: •»».,7 -what Is needed will be ade quately done. I close, as began, by reminding you of the great tasks and duties of neace which challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will last, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times with free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we nossess. To develoo our life and our re sources to supply our own peoole. and the reopie of the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty of our f'ehls and 071 marts of trade: to enrich the com merce of our own states and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms, and our fa'torles. with the creations of mir thought and the fruits of our charac ter—this is what will hold otir attention ind ottr enthusiasm steadily, now and In Hie years to come, as we ?trive to show in our life as a nation wh.t liberty and 'nspirations of an emancipated SDirit mav 'o for mf:n and for societies, for Individ uals, for states, and for mankind.
