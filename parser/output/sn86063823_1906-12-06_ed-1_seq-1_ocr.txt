Most of the papers here highly eulogize Presi dent Roosevelt's attitude towards the Japanese, as expressed in his mes sage. Ashi says: "By his firm atti tude, prompted by a lofty sense of justice, President Roosevelt has added new lustre to his already great fame. It is hoped that all tr-ie Americans will unite in support of his righteous policy." Nochis psaises Mr. Roosevelt's at titude as just and impartial and is rejoiced to find it in perfect ajrd with the views of the Japanese gov ernment. Jiji is grateful that Roosevelt hhs expressed exactly what the Japanese would say. The press is almost unanimous in confidently predicting a satisfactory solution of the San Francisco compli cations. '- ' New Japanese Treaty. i. Chicago, Dec. 6. A dispatch to the Tribune from- Washingtonsays: ' Viscount AokL the Japanese ambas sador, went to the White House yes terday on invitation of the President. They discussed the proposition to negotiate an entirely new treaty, es pecially recognizing the right of each country to exclude the laborers of the other. Such a provision as far as the Japanese are concerned is em braced In the present treaty, but both ' the President and the ambassador thought it would satisfy the pride of the Japanese if their right to treat the - Americans as the Americans treat them were recognized. Such a treaty would please the people of California and show them that the President was prepared to go to the extent of excluding the coolie Japa nese if it should become necessary. It was said yesterday that Secretary Root, under the direction of the Pres ident, is actually engaged in nego tiating a new treaty ;with Japan, which will specifically grant the Japanese the same rights in the pub lic schools as are granted European aliens. The senate -would" kill such a treaty, as the present sentiment in dicates that not ten' per cent of the Republicans and non-Democrats would vote for a treaty which in any way attempted to limit the rights of a municipality to manage its own school affairs.

LEADERS. PECOS VALLEY EXHIBIT. Rev. A. Foltz Here From Friday Un til Monday Showing the Won derful Products of Roswell. The Pecos Valley, New Mexico, ex hibit car was side-tracked at the San ta Fe station Friday, and Saturday of last week proved a decided attrac tion to many of our people. This is the second trip of the Pecos Valley exhibit car to St. John. The purpose is to show the wonderful products of that fertile valley. The car is un der the management of Rev. A. Folta formerly pastor of the First Baptist Church of St. John. Much has been said of the Pecos Valley country; but nothing that will convey an accurate conception of its many products equal to the exhibit car. The car is a bower of beauty to those who admire the works of na ture. The walls and ceiling were hung with ripened grains of all kinds Upon tables arranged on either side were piled products of the garden and truck farms, bushels of the world-famed big red apples, which in color and flavor command, the mark- et'stop price. There were bushels of grapes weighing from three to four pounds. Samples of oats were shown that yielded seventy-eight bushels to the acre on sod land. Five crops of alfalfa are' harvested each year in the Pecos Valley, one year's crop amounting to almost en ough to pay for the land. .. It is surely a most wonderful coun try and the price of land is advanc ing rapidly. Rev. Foltz has made a great deal of money out of Pecos Valley land and says that land there is a "snap," no matter what price is asked for it. The exhibit car is sent out under the direction of the Commercial Club of Roswell, Lakewood Artesia and Hagerman.

PRESBYTERIANS' NEW PASTOR IS INSTALLED. Before a large audience iffa.de up of church people of all denomina tions, Rev. Edwin Emerson Davis was formally installed last night as pastor of the Presbyterian church. The service was held in the Presby terian church. All the pastors of Roswell , were invited to take part, and as many of them as could possi bly be present did so. Rev. C. E. Lu- kens, the former pastor, presided over the meeting. The service was opened with a prelude on the organ by Mrs. C. A. Norvell, after which the congregation sang a hymn. Then Rev. E. H. Ed gar, of Hagerman, gave a brief ser mon paying tribute to prayer and its influence and appealing for its use. Mrs. Florence E. Kilgour "sang "The Angels' Anthem" most beauti fully, after which Rev. C. E. Lukens propounded the constitutional ques tions on the line set down by the Presbyterian church, Rev. Mr. Davis giving the responses. This was fol lowed by the prayer of installation by Rev. E. E. Mathes, of Artesia. After an anthem by the choir, Mr. Lukens gave the -charge to the new pastor, telling him In minuteness of detail the things that would be expec ted of him and the things he should expect to do. He defined the duties of any pastor in this address. Rev. Mr. Mathes gave the charge to the people, . instructing them to aid the new pastor in every way possible, and especially by their contribution, prayer and presence at church. This was followed by a solo by L. R- Al exander, which is declared to have been one of the finest ever heard in Roswell. " Rev. H- 3P. . Vermillion, pastor of the Baptist church, was 'the first out side minister called upon, and he gave a short talk showing Ms Joy at the spirit of naton In 'all Christian work ant showing how this spirit has grown In the past few decades. Rev. J. W. Smith, pastor of the Southern M. E; church, spoke large ly to the new pastor, telling that, a a young man, he had many things to learn and that he would x have to adapt himself to the circumstances and surroundings of a new country. Rev. John Murray, the new pastor of the First M. E. church, told of once hearing Rev. Mr. Davis in New York, and spoke in a general way of the religious work all the minis ters in Roswell have before them, and bespeaking for all the greatest of success. All -the visiting pastors spoke in a humorous vein part of the time, and what they had to say was given in evident good faith. Their remarks served as a livening influence on the program. After a fervent benedic tion by Rev. Mr. Davis, Mrs. Norvell played the postlude, and an informal reception was held, at which Mrs. Davis was presented to the members of the audience.
