NO PAPERS Judge Robinson Warned Jurymen. NOT TO" READ. One of the Prisoners Makes a Statement-Detective Dodds Also Told What He Knows. Judge Robinson has provided against any newspaper taking a prominent part In the case for murder against Charles Bassett, now before him and a Jury in the superior court. ; When, adjourning court last evening he warned the Jury that it would be well for them not to read anything that the newspapers may publish about . the cause and that if anyone persisted in speaking about the case in their pres ence to report the matter to him and to speak to no one about it but among themselves. Dr Graves was on the stand when court adjourned and medical expres sions were flying thick and fast be tween him and Attorney Russell, who was appointed by the court to defend Bassett. Over in the corner of the room in the prisoners' dock Cenesky and Leonard sit the whole day long craning their necks this wa-y and that to catch every word spoken by wit ness and counsel, while Preston, who will testify for the state, it is expect ed, sits calmly and apparently uncon cerned in a comfortable chair in front of the sheriff's desk. To-day Ceneskj and Leonard sat very much apart and the idea Is gaining ground that one of them will follow the example of Fres ton. Dr M. J. Donahue Is a close observer of the proceedings. He appears far the defense. Attorney Russell's questions showed that he primed himself last evening on the structure of the human body aud the ills it is heir to. for all his questions bad been written out. Toward the close yesterday Mr Rus sell tried to show that the softened condition in which witness found part of Lock wood's brain on the autopsy was due to imperfect embalming or the use of a. certain embalming ma terial, but witness held that the em balming was perfect. After lM'iug ten minutes on the stand this morning Dr Graves gavo way to George E. Townsend of Mid dlebury. Townseud Is a letter carrier on the free delivery route between Wa terbury and Middlebury, and his route takes in Park. road, on which Lock- wood lived. -He said where Lockwtl j lITPtl 'l'a ToTrcTyl)laee.

Lock wood" and was in a sleigh. Ickwood acted aa though dar.ed. Blood was ci his hair and clothing. He had no hat on and he was badly battered up. After paying him some money he owed the old 'man the latter left the sleigh and went home, and witness drove away ami called at Mr Fortln'a house, one-quarter of a mile distant, and Informed him of tbe condition In which he found Lockwood. Joseph E. Fortln, alwve referred to. testified that be knew old Lockwood about seven years, and during that time he lived all alone. He used to visit him a few times each week. About two hours after being told by Townsend of tbe occurrence at Ixck wood's he drove to tbe place and found Mr Atwood and Iorkwood there. The old man was In the same condition as when Townsend had left him. Wit ness came to Waterbttry after being In tbe house fifteen minutes and told De tective lHHlds of the affair and Iwtk returned to Lockwood's house immedi ately. The old man had then a cap on. and he took It off and showed his battered head to him. One wound, particularly, attracted his attention. U was back on top of the head, about cn Inch lmig and one-half Inch wide Dried hi.! was all over his face, hair and clothing. . A numlKT of photoirraphs of Lock wood's house were then lntrodu-d, showing Interior snd exterior view. Herbert X. Lock wood.

Mr Russell took him through a Ion and tedioti cross examination snd the ouly thing re elicited from him ws that Ickwonrt' mind dwelt a gd aesl on his rattle, for he used to frequently remark It wa time o feed "the critters." when In fact "the critter" bad been fed.

Leaving that soon, he went back to Farley, expecting trouble in Wilkes barre, Pa, but the strike did not take place. He next went to work on tho New York subway when the trolley meu ftere struck. He then lived at 16W Lawrence street Brooklyn. It was there he first met Bassett the ac cused. He used to call upon the folks living on the lower floor. This was last January and toward the latter part of that month Bassett went into the witness' room one evening about 7:30. Preston was with him. He be came acquainted with Preston when he had worked here. Preston called to witness room first and Bassett about half an hour Inter. A girt named Lena Paige, whom witness fcnew here, was with him. She was living with witness then. They re mained together an hour ami discussed the ways and means of robbing old Lockwood. The subject was brought up by Preston. He told Bassett tbat Lockwood was a miser and had a lot of money hoarded lu his trunk, and would l'ke to know if he would go and get it. Bassett asked him ir he saw the money" and he said he -did, that it was on the second floor in n itrunk and that the old man used to call him Into the house on his way from school ami show him the money. The old man told him the paper mon ey was yellowbacks. Bassett said he could not attend to the matter for a week and that ho would talk It over with Preston how they could get at the money. Prc-ton Itheh Jeff, but he came back In a few moments and got talking with Bas sett. He asked Bassett how much he would take for the Job and he said that of course he would take half of what he found in the trunk. Witness did not know where Lockwood's house was then. There was some tallr or ns Ing chloroform on tho old man. Bas sett suggested this. Preston said there was a skeleton hanging In the rwm where the money was and they could use that to scare the old man. A week or so later Bassett called again at Leonard's room. Joseph C nesky, the other accused, was there before him. He became acquainted with Cenesky during the trolley strike here. Witness thought the Paige girl was also preseut. They talked about robbing Lockwood. Ce nesky said he know where Lockwood's house was and that all he knew about tbe old man's money was what Pres ton had told him. 'Bassett said ho had no Idea of doing the Job for a few weeks yet and he told Cenesky h could chloroform the old man and get the money without hurting hlra, be cause he had chloroformed a man in Harlem, N. Y., only two weeks before. Witness advised against using chloro form and there was some talk of Preston not taking part In the affair, as It would not be safe for him be cause tbe old man might recognize him. He saw Bassett a few nights after the second Interview on Lawrence street., Tbey..dIdnot Sieak to each .other,. That same night, an hour or so later, Bassett. Cenesky. the Taige girl and another mnn named Grover met In Leonard's room. Bassett wanted to play cards. It was about 11 o'clock and there was a rap at the door and Bassett left the room by a window which opened on a roof. That was the last seen of Bassett that night. Wit ness did not see Bassett again till about three weeks later, when a letter for him was received at the house. In consequence of that note Leonard went to Bridgeport by boat. This was late in February. He met Bassett there with Cenesky on Fast Main street. Tbey went to a house on East Main street and stayed there that night. All were to go to Waterbury next morning, and to get np eaiHy so that people would not see them leave the house. AH slept In the same room and got up about 3 or 4 In the morn ing. Seeing there were no trains they took a trolley car to Ansonia and from there they took a train and reached Waterbury about 10 and went to Cen esky's house on North Ionsrd street. There they stayed till about 4 o'clock. They then waiked out North Main street to Preston's house and stayed there all night This was on Sunday. Before going to Cenesky's house tTiey went to West Side hill and viewed the surroundings of Ixickwood's bouse and saw the old man walking in the yard. They were on the road. As they were passing the hoiwe RaHt said it was a shame to t.-ike the old man's money. They then walked lack to Cenesky's house aud stayed there nntil early morning. It wa decided by them to go out to lockwood's house iicfore he would get up to milk his cows. Bnt they did not get np till 9 o'clock and towsnl noon ther walked out to Lockwood.

Leonard advised Bassett to be careful or he would kill him, and the old man put up his hands to save him self. Attorney Kellogg here produced an old musket which Leonard said Lock wook took from behind a door to pro- . tect himself and that Bassett took it from him. Bassett raised the weapon to strike tbe old man again aud the old man shouted. Bassett told Leonard to call ' in Cenesky, and Leonard went to the door and did not s. for a moment what was taking place. When he look.-d back he saw the old man lying on a chair, his head hanging over its back. A chair like the one mentioned was the one used. The back seemed to have been sawed off and the seat broken. Resuming his. story Leonard said Basset cried out "Hurry up, get up there and see where that trunk is." The three went to the room upstairs but could find no trunk there. When they came down from the room they found Lockwood stretched on tho floor. He was conscious but did not speak. They searched the house ami found a bank book. Bpsset took the book and looked at It a moment and then exclaimed "Everybody out, there is no money in this house." Bassett then tied or tried to tie Lockwood's hands for Lockwood was trying to get up. Cenesky and Leon ard went toward tbe door. Leonard who was In the rear looked back and saw tbe old man on his hands aud knees trying to get up. Bassett went back, picked up the old gun by the barrell and struck him three times on the head. Leonard cried out "Look out or you'll kill tbe man" and Bassett threw down the gun telling the old man that he hud better lay down and threw a camfortable over him, Tbe three then left the house. As they were leaving Leonard picked np a'u old watch which Bassett pawned In Bridgeport with an overcoat he had taken from the house. After leaving the house they re turned to Cenesky's house and Bassett proceeded to clean his clothes which had numerous blood stains. Bassett'a revolver was here introduced. It was of the bulldog pattern. Overcoats lo Measure. $25 ; , Paddock. $32; Silk lined. Made of Melton, Kersey or Vi cuna, In Black or Oxford. These overcoatings are extra good val ues. .
