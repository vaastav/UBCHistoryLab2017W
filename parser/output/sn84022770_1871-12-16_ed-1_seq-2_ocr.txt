DEP. 16,1871. The Echo and Ourself. Tlie Echo acknowledges that there is tome truth in our article of last week, re lating to the position of the temperance lodges and the Republican nominees for Congress in several of the pnst contests. While it freely a flirty that it " is not ilia posed to deny the truth " of some of our assertions, it objects to receiving them be cause it affects to believe they are " not given in the spirit of truth." Now we ob ject to the spirit having anything to do with deciding the merits of the controver sy. When we present facts, we expect that they shall be received as facts. If the essence of truth is given, it should matter but little what may be the spirit which prompts it. Truth is a gem that cannot bo tarnished by falsehood or sophistry, •nd all the verbiage our cotemporary is capable of piling upon the subject cannot obscure ita brightness or diminish its power for good. The Erho admits our propositions in the *tai». To quote its own language : " In one of the instances to which the 

STAND ARD alludes, his enndidnte was dnnhtless supe rior in moral worth, bat he bad nothing which was calculated to draw out and attach temper ance men to kit support." We have reason to believe that our co temporary alludes to Gov. Moore, in the above quotation, the Democratic nominee in opposition to Garfielde in his first cam paign. The moral superiority of our can didate being admitted by the Echo, we presume that point is settled; but wc most emphatically deny that his opponent pre sented superior claims to the support of temperance men. If the Governor did set wines before his guests, or indulged in their OM, it was in obedience to social cus toms that he regarded as imperative as any common usages of society. As Govern or, he was bound to respect the ruW of hospitality, and it was no part of his duty to fly in the faoe of popular sentiment by affecting support of a reform which had not yet learoed to distinguish its friends from its foes. But Garfieldd, the Echo indirectly affirms, had something to " draw out and attach temperance men to his sup port." What was it ? Will the Echo an swer ? Was it his eontempt for the obli gation of the Order ? Was it his habits of dissipation 1* Was it his association with gamblers, or his well known skill in the game of poker ? Was it that while lie was reeking with the fumes of the bar room, so versatile was his genius, that he could sit in the councils of the faithful with the iosigoia of innocence and purity upon his breast and whisper his vows at the shrine of the sanctuary ? l'ardon the tpirit that prompts, and answer, dear Echo. candidly, frankly, honestly. Then again, while you affirm that in the lodge "no political party or creed is known," in the same breath you excuse Good Templars for supporting Garfielde, or what does this language mean ? _" Tl ere wtre mom rer some political prin ciples at issue, bearing upon the best interests of the nation, which they deemed important to be maintained. These have now, for tbe most part, become so thoroughly interwoven with the political fabric ot tbe government, as to be in a measure settled." Now, we ask, have not those clauses a political significance f This must be ad mitted, and then the query arises, which candidate, judging from his political rec ord, wai best adapted to subserve those u best interests of the oatioo," the patriot •ad soldier, who carried the wounds re ceived while upholding the nation, its honor and glory, or the politician, who af ter « campaign in opposition to the war, W to the wilds of British Columbia, aod there preached treason until it was no longer fashionable or profitable? The £dt» well knows that this palaver about " national interests," is nonsenso as ap plied to the politics of this Territory, ouly iii(< uilnl l«> dcffitf ili«* uia»»c« and aecure their aid to foi»t into place a few aspiring demagogue*. Kxcu-e the apirit which pn metallic inquiry, dear Etho. and in »wer, iao't it *o ? In conclusion, arc cannot refrain from congratulating the Orucr upon the decided improvement in tlic loading articles of the Echo. It of late nianvi'csts Du disposition to avoid a discussion of its principles, and instead of heaping abuse upon its oppo nents, seems dispoted to appeal to the reasoning faculties of its palrous, rather thau to stimulate and keep alive the baser passions and prejudice*. *AR A city cotomporary, with n Rood deal of satisfaction, makes merry over what be'ap poses to lie a fact, that lager beer was drank at tiood Templars hall on the occasion of a dancing party which was recently held in it. We have made diiigeut inquiry and tind no one who saw anything of the kind and hence are forced to the conclusion that the only lager at the party was tinder the waistcoat of the afor >aitl coteinporary.— i'eho. W'c presume that our cotemporary has made just such diligent inquiry iu this instance, as lie did when it wa9 charged that tiarOclde, although a member of the order in good standing, drank whisky. The publisher of the Echo appeared to manifest much zeal in obtaining the facts, but took good care not to inquire of any body who could give direct information upon the matter, aud the result was that he could produce a large number of " wit nesses" to testify that they had not seen Sclucious partake of the forbidden beve rages. This course puts us in mind of a certain silly bird which when pursued, is •aid to thrust its head in the sand, thus obscuring its own vision doubtless in the belief that the pursuer is likewise blinded by the maneuver. In the above quotation our colcmporary again betrays his anxiety to impress upon the public the belief that we indulge in the immoderate use of la-jer beer. In fact the chief efforts of that journal appear always to have been direc ted towards inculcating, the belief that all its political friends abstain from the use of alcoholic beverages, though they may stagger through the streets or play sineh until the small hours of morning, and that the editor of this paper and his friends live, breathe and have their being amidst the fuuie9 of " Asthmatic Bitters" aud la ger beer. This is by no means the Icigitimat sphere of the organ of a great temperance reform, and betrays unmistakably the in capacity of those having it in charge. A VICTIM.—A year or more ago we published one of the circulars scattered broadcast through the mails by rogues in New York, and other Eastern cities, proposing to send counterfeit greenbacks for a small remittance in good money. It appears that these knaves find occasionally people who are green enough to invest in the palpable swindle and fraud. A few days ago a box was received at the express office in this place, addressed to a farmer living on the Skookum Chuck, with a bill of charges amounting to $lO3, to be paid before the delivery of the box. The ap plicant not having the money to pay these charges, but stating that it contained a remittance from a relative, the agent very obligingly allowed him to open the pack age, upon the promise to pay the charges out of tho proceeds. But alas! for the expectations of the enterprising recipient, upon raising the lid, a slip of paper was disclosed containing the words " Mr. you're sold; don't tell anybody," and a dili gent search only brought to light scraps of paper and shavings, a few sheets of lead, and pieces of an iron casting. The victim of the " sell" insists that he is not a party to the fraud ; that he really expect a re mittance from a relative; but the facts arc as we state them, and a letter submitted to the inspection of the agent by him announ ces the shipment of a package of coun terfeit money. But we give him the benefit of his denial of complicity, and of the donbt, if there is room for a doubt in the nutter. BIUDINO SHOPS. —Henry Ward Bcoch er recently declared that " every 'custom house in the country is a bribing shop." A cotemporary adds: Very true. But the custom houses arc not the only bribing shops in the country. The White House is little less than a bribing shop if not a great deal worse, and the War Department is in the same bunt. Congress itself is a bribing shop of the most depraved and colossal proportions, and there is not a rad ical in the country who does not recognize and act, if he- acts at all, upon the known fact.

The C'orvsllis (Ogoj Gazette, in dol ing iu eighth volume, lays: •' It wonM be interesting to review the his tory of I lie Hurtle through ail these lo tg yrmn, ar.d note some of the important event* lust have bero chronicled.

This is au original altcrnativefor inditing a long article abounding in vigor, power, warmth, scntentiousness, sublimity and pa thos. The reader can elaborate such incident* in this mental exercise as suit h'l9 peculiar fancy, or his precise tempera ment, at that cxict time. lie can but be pleased with the retrospect, none can be offended by the substitution of views at va riance with his pre-couceived ideas, and t'lerc can be no cavil upon questions in vo'ving nice and subtile points of distinc tion. What an improvement it is upon the old system of editing a newspaper! How easy it will be, when this plan is generally adopted, to conduct a political jonrnal. For instance we could say : " Se lucius Garfielde—our readers can run over iu their minds the secessiou pro clivities, the gambling propensities and drinking habits of this celebrated individ ual, arid that must suffice for the pre-c.it. ' Or, " Flanders and the Good Templars— our readers can review in their minds the incidents succeeding the Flanders cam paign, aud—sufficient for day is the evil thereof." Then how easy it would be to write pufFs. We could say, " Bettman, twelve yeurs in business—our readers cau review iu their minds the incidents which have contributed to this firm's marked success." Or, " Ligiitner &, Rosenthal— San Francisco. Olympia. We leave our readers to infer the advantages to be de rived from a member of the firm residing in San Francisco." Or, " Macleay, Hirscl), Louthan, Harris, or I'arker—big stocks— viricd assortments —cheap for cash ; wo leave our readers to supply from imagina tion everything further necessary for a first-class puff." The Gazette should pat ent the process as one tending to sim plify and adorn the profession, and obviate in a great measure the necessity, for the Oregon style of journalism," heretofore so prevalent on this coast.

Message which refers to oar relations with Ureal Britain : The past year has, under a wise Provi dence, beeu one of general prosperity to the nation. It has, however, been attend ed with more than usual chastisements in l<iss of life aud property by storui and fire. The disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country, aud to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign natious which goes far towards alleviating the distress occa sioned by calamities. The beoevoleot who have so generally shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes will reap their reward in the conciousness of having performed a noble act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of men, woman and child ren whose sufferings they have relieved. The relations of the Uuited States with foreign powers continues to be frieodly. The year has been an eventful one, in see ing two great nations speaking one lan guage and having one lineage, settling by peaceful arbitrations disputes of long standing, and liable at auy time to bring these nations into hostile conflict. An ex ample has thus been set, which, if success ful iu its final issue, may bo followed by other civilized nations, and be the fiual means of returning to productive industry millions of men maintained to settle the disputed of nations by the bayonet aud sword. I transmit herowith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which lias been concluded since the adjournment of Congress, with her Britanic Majesty, and u t»py of the pro tocols of (he conferences of Commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provide* methods for adjusting the ques tions pending between the two nations. The various questions arc to be adjusted by arbitrations. [ recommend Congress at an early day to make provision for the tribu nal of Geneva, and also for the several Commissioners on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. His Ma jesty the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and his Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, have each consent ed, on the joint request of the two Pow ers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to bo suitably expressed for the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with, by the appointment of gen tlemen of eminence and learning to the high positions. Ilis Majesty tho Empc ror of Germany, has been pleased to com ply with the joint wish of the two Govern ments and has consented to act as arbitra tor of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Bri tain. The contracting parties in tho treaty have undertaken to rezard as between themselves, certain principles of Cuhlic law for which the United States ave contended from the commencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowlodge of other maritime powers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations arc going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the Powers. I recommend the legislation necessary on ike part of the United States te bring Into operation articles of the treaty relat ing to fisheries and other matters touching the relations of the United States toward* (he British North American possessions to become operntive as soon as proper legis lation shall be had on the part of Great Hritnin and its possessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fishermen of the Uni ted States begin to make arrangements for the coming season I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is trans mitted herewith, to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania. Ohio, Indiana, Mich igan. Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the Governors of these States respectively the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the articles of the treaty which contemplate the use of canals on cither side connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundery in terms of equity bv the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped the importance of the object and benefits to flow therefrom will secure speedily approval and legisla tive sanction of the States concerned. Recent Transfers of Real Estate.

B. —At a meeting of the Committee of Commerce yesterday, A. A. Low submitted a letter from Olyphant & Co., of China, regarding the outrages comtnited on Chinaman ut Los Angeles, California, with extracts from certaiu newspapers on the same subject. They suggested that such outrages will tend to render the lives and property of all Amer icans in China unsafe. Low hoped tho Chamber of Commerce would take action on the matter. The Chinese in California have been subjected fr.ni the first to uttacts from the lower classes. In that State there is antagonism between the labor of Chinaman and whites, and this letter sets forth the danger that constantly begets the Chinese. Hethought it worthy of action on the part of our Gov ernment; that the character of the nation in its treatment of these people way be sustained. The letter and accompanying newspaper accounts were referred to a standing committee with instructions to report thereon yesterday.
