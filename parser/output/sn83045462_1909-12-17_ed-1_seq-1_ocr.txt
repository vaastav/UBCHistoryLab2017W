The newspaper correspondents also were Admitted to the room, whose bare walls and simple furnishings were In marked i *<Tw^S^^Mng candles threw an uncer tain light on a face as yellow as wax, but which in death had lost none of Its aus terity. The long, square-cut beard was enowy white. * The expression on the dead monarch's face is peaceful, as though the end was painless. Tlie, body, will be placed in a casket this evening, when a period of mourning officially will begin. Obsequies at St. Oudula. immediately following Leopold's death t-vo nuns laid out the body. Prepara tions for conveying it to the city proper were made. ThVdbsequles' will take place at the collegiate-Church of St. Gudula. This morning early Premier Schollaert proceeded to the palace.

After much persuasion today Baron CJoffinet. private secretary to King Leo pold. who is greatly affected by the sudden termination of the king's ill ness. described the scene at the palace. "The king's body." salc^ the baron, "rests on his bed. His expression is peaceful. All in the household are in tears, gathered about the body. "We have informed the ministers of ?.he sad event." The newspaper correspondents were not permitted in the palace this morning. Voluminous Will in Court. it is said that l^eopold's will consti tutes a good-sized volume.

Nearly Alone, Leopold Dies; End Comes Painlessly Sp/>> ial Cablegram to Tin' Star. 

BRUSSELS. December IT.?King Leo pold II died at 2:.% o'clock this morning. It seemed fitting that a monarch to whom natural ties were as naught, who had cjuareled bitterly with those who were nearest and dearest to him should have passed away practically alone. Two stories ure current regarding tlie deathbed scene. According to one, Drs. Thiviar and L>e Pag?- and the nurse were alone present. Another account says there were also present two priests and the Baroness Vaughan, to whom, according to report, the king was married by re J ligious ceremony some time ago in Italy. The king was sleeping peacefully when ; the nun who had been acting as the i night nurse heard him sigh. She hur riedly called Dr. Thiviar, who was rest I ing in an adjoining room. When the physician reached the bedside the king ejaculated: "'I am choking, doctor. I am | choking." End Came Peacefully. These were the last words of the mon arch, whose name haij been a byword in Europe for many years. L>r. Thiviar injected morphia una vail tng ly. Death bad supervened. Dr. Thiviar, in an interview in the Etoile Beige, said: "We had our apprehensions, for we knew the king suffered from a malady of the heart. This was our chief anxiety when we performed the operation. "We decided to do so in spite of all in order to save his majesty from terrible suffering. As a matter of fact the king died without suffering at all." Prince Albert. Princess Clementine and Princess Stephanie readied the Pavilion des Palmiers twenty-five minutes after all was over. Princess Louise is ex pected to arrive today. When Prince Albert motored to the pal- . ac he went directly upstairs. Bending , over the body", he reverently kissed his dead uncle. When lie left the mortuary chamber he was overcome with emotion. Princess Elizabeth, his wife, and Princess Stephanie and Princess Clementine knelt beside the body weeping. Baron Goffinet, King Leopold's private secretary, went immediately to Brussels, by motor, to notify the other members of the royal family. Before starting he said: "And to think yesterday evening we were so hopeful. Onlv two of us re mained beside the king." All morning there was a constant going and coming of dignitaries and messen gers between the palace and Brussels. The vicar of l^aeken. of t~hose summoned, was the first to reach the bedside of the dead monarch. He was followed shortlv by Compte Doultrimont. grand marshal of the court; Carton De Wiart. one of Leopolds secretary a, ami Baron Goffinet Press Is Excluded. The president of the Belgian Press As sociation asked to be received by the Baron GofBnet to present a request from various newspapermen to be admitted Inside the palace. He was met with a refusal. The baron said he had received one journalist. The others would have to draw upon his paper, he directed, for their Information. All Journalists are ex tremely dissatisfied at this treatment. The -body of the king ha* been dressed , in the uniform of a lieutenant general. It is as yet unknown when the body will be conveyed to Brussels. It is remarkable that it was fortv-four years ago today that Leopold II inaugu rated his reign by taking the oath in Brussels to preserve the constitution Among those present at that ceremonv were: The Prince of Wales, now King Edward VII of England; the future Em peror Frederick of Germany, then Crown Prince of Prussia, and Prince Arthur, now the Duke of Connaugbt. Baroness' Marriage to King Leopold Valid Special Cablegrajii to The War. 

LONDON.

FRANCE MOURNS FIND ENGLAND REJOICES IN END OF BAD RULER. Follies Forgiven and Kindnesses Recalled by Southern Neighbor. ? PARIS, December 17.?The death of King Leopold of Belgium removes one of the stanchest friends of Prance. He saved Belfort for France after the war of 1871. During numerous crises in the history of the third republic he never failed to place his sound advice at the disposition of the government. Though his pleasure-loving follies mar red his career. French statesmen con sider that the role played by Leopold II in Europe was large and distinctive of a political peacemaker. He was frequently the counselor of other monarchs. Though he broke with every member of his own family, at times, his intervention is believed to have prevented scandal and trouble In many princely houses, notably those of Ger many and Austria. Personally, he was extremely fond of France and spent a great portion of his time here. A few years ago he was a familiar figure on the boulevards, at the opera and in the restaurants, where he earned the title. of "The Sportiest King in Europe." Since his alliance with Baroness Vaughan. however, the places of amuse ment had seen little of him. Hope for Belief in Kongo. LONDON, December 17.?It is thought here that the death of King Leopold can have little effect upon the political situa tion of Europe apart from the with drawal from the scene of the man who knew the Innermost secrets of every state, and whose intellectual and practi cal talents, especially in former years, , were drawn upon frequently by brother sovereigns. ? - All comment here lays at Leopold's j door the responsibility for the barbar ! ities committed in the Kongo. It is be I lieved that his removal will *be followed by new methods of administration in that colony. It is understood that his successor on the throne profited greatly by his recent tour of Africa, and that he will be more pliant in agreeing to reforms than was his masterful uncle. With the death of Leopold the lease of the Lado Enclave expires. Great Britain will resume sovereignty on behalf of the Sudan. This enclave wm leased to Leopold during his life to give the Kongo access, to the Nile. Friction Over Case. It was felt in this country that it was a good stroke of policy at a time when the relations between England and France were strained to give an inde pendent power a firm footing in the up per reaches of the waterway, the posses sion of which was then debatable. The lease led to friction at times, as the methods of Kongo administration spread through I,ado. The death of the king had less effect on the stock exchange than had been anticipated. The shares of some of the African mines in which Ijeopold had large holdings dropped a fraction, but recovered, and the market does not ex pect much of this stock to be ofTered. The easing of prices here when his Ill ness first became acute was more in anticipation of selling on the Paris bourse than because of the actual of fering of shares here. CHOICE^ DELAYED ' ? ? President Not Ready to Name Commissioners. OTHER BUSINESS PRESSING President Taft Cancels All Engage ments for Tomorrow. The nominations of two District Com missioners will not go to the Senate until some time in January, after the reassem bling of Congress from the Christmas holiday?. The President has found that he is too much engaged in other business to reach the District appointments for final settle ment for another week or ten days. Con gress will have adjourned for the holi days before that time, and It would be of no benefit to announce the selections until Congress was ready to act upon them. One cause of delay in possible action by the President was the death last night of the wife of his brother, Horace D. Taft. The President has canceled his engage ments for tomorrow. Representative Smith, chairman of the House District committee, had an appointment with the President this morning to go over the District situa tion, but on learning of the death in the family of the chief ewiecutlve told the President he would call next week. Senator Galllnger will go away from Washington Monday, and the President may do nothing on the District problem until he has talked with him. Honors Leopold's Memory. President Taft left the White Houne for a few minutes this morning and went to the Belgian legation on H street, leaving his card as a token of honor to the mem ory of King Leopold of Belgium. The President hastened back in his automobile and went to the cabinet room, where the cabinet officers were assembled for the regular Friday meeting. President Taft had a distinguished luncheon gathering today. The guests were Otto Bannard, reoent republican nominee for mayor of New York; William Loeb, jr., collector of customs of New York; George Thompson, proprietor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press; H. V. Jones of the Minneapolis Journal and Mayor Rhett of Charleston. S- C. Oklahoma Land Case Suits. Senator Owen of Oklahoma made the request today that the President take notice of the coming decision of the Cnited States circuit court of appeals 1 of the eighth circuit in the allotted land cp.se suits of Oklahoma, 30.000 pieces of property being involved. The Oklahoma Senator told the President he was confi dent the court of appeals would hold these suits, whlqh have been prosecuted by the Department of Justice, ought not to have bwm brought. The federal cir cuit court in Oklahoma dismissed the cases and Senator Owen thinks that the administration ought to let up should the <-lrcult court of appeal* knock them out. Senator Owen declares that he does not believe the President or Attorney Gen eral Wickersham really knows what is being done by subordinate officers of the Department of Justice In continuing their effoiffc in these cases in the face of ad verse decisions. Senator Ballsy With the President. Senator Bailey of Texas was one of tbs President's visitors. The Texaa leader, who never visited the White House dur ing the terms of President Roosevelt, fs fond of President Taft and enjoys a visit with him. Another democratic caller was Senator Shively of Indiana. Senator Nelson of Minnesota also saw ike President.

LOUIS, December 17.?The Stand urd Oil Company of New Jersey and Its subsidiary co-defendants in the govern ment's dissolution suit recently decided against the corporations will file an as signment of error and ask for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States late today.

A bailiff appeared this morning at the residence of Baroness Vaughan, It Is said, with the object of seizing the prem ises on behalf of Prinoess Louise. The baroness successfully prevented the for mal service upon her. It Is expected that the matter will be brought into the courts. Children Not Eligible to Throne. The socialist organ, the Peuple. vio lently attacks the memory of the king because he repulsed his daughters and admitted his favorite to his bedside. The paper discusses the reported morganatic marriage of the king and Baroness Vaughan, and asks whether the children of this union will hold pretensions to the throne. This point apears to be settled by the constitution. The children will have no right*. It is understood they will inherit a great part of the king's immense per sonal fortune. The newspapers in special editions' de vote several page6 to the life of the king, whose private life is criticised generally, wlille his intellectual greatness is extoll ed.
