WASHINGTON, D. C., Deo. C.-Ths attendance upon tho session of the senate to-day both on the floor and in the galleries was notably large despite-ol the well understood fact that little business beyond the presentation of the president's message and the proceedings incident thereto would be transacted. Trior to the convening of the senate, the members passed half an hour In exchanging'ercetings. Mr. Hanna, of Ohio, who hat been ill for a week, was given n /v?r#1lnt r#nonl!ne }iv Vila T}r.rvihllf*nn colleagues. Mr. Wolcott, of Colorado, one of the members of tho international monetary commission, was also given a warm greeting. Dr. W. Godfrey Hunter, of Kentucky, the recently appointed minister to Guatemala, was an interested spectator of the 'proceedings from a seat beside his friend, Senator Deboe. Charles Page Bryan, the new United Ftatrs minister to China, was o notable figure In the reserved gallery and In the diplomatic gallery were several memhers of the Chinese legation and other members of the diplomatic corps. When tho senate convened after the recast, Hon. II. D. P. Money, the new senator from Mississippi, entered the chamber, but the oath of olHce was not administered to him during the seislon. The reception and reading of the President's mesaagc was the important and only feature of the day. The opening day of tho regular session lu the house passed without unusual Incident of any character. The formalities attending tho Inauguration of the session are dry nnd except on n spectacle hardly repaid the crowd* which thronged the public and private galleries. Yet with few'"exceptions the visitors sat through the whole proceedings Mr. Dlngley, the floor leader of the majority. Mr. Bailey, the recognized leader of the minority nnd Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, enjoyed tho distinguished honor of being appointed to wait upon the President whose messace was, of coursp, the ev;nt of (he day. ItH reading was lonjr and tedious, but it was followed with close attention by the members and tho spectators In the galleries. There was no demonstration until the rending was concluded, when the Republicans Joined In a hearty ex; -citsioii of approval. Immediately after the rending of the message the house ndjoumed, out of respect to the memories of Senator George, or Mississippi, and Representative Wright, of Massachusetts, wiio had died durim; the recess. The floral tributes for the members tvero numerous and in some Instances Imposing. One, which attracted probably more attention than any other on account of Its unique character, graced the desk of General Qroivenor, of Ohio, lit consisted of n huge tree of yellow chrysanthemums and American beauty rf*es. under the nodding branches of which stood an innocent looking toy lamb It was a tribute from the National Wool Growers' Association. Some cr." discovered that under the admlnls -atlon of pressure to a portion of the tomb's anatomy It would Rive forth a sound resembling a t>l? it and much "v.usoment and merriment followed this disclosure.

VARIOUS VIEWS I UiprtiiMl by Scu?iors Upon Prcaidint Mc* Kinlry'a Mcmiikc. WASHINGTON, Deo, O.-Democratlc Senators were generally averse to expressing any opinion upon the meeaage. Senator White (Dem., Cala.), member of the finance committee, was disposed to take the messago Jocularly. He said: "The message Is elaborate, though its conclusions are somewhat volled." View's by Republican senators were expressed as follows: Senator Hale: "The recommendation in regard to Cuba is In all respects admirable and one with which I am much pleased. On the subject of tfte 11 nance the President does not press for Immediate action, and as for myself I do not believe that such would be possible under the circumstances." Senator Hoar: "It struck me a.H a wise, a compact and carefully considerate document." Senator Forak^r: "As a whole the message is an aible document, but I do not agreo with the President's conclusions on the subject of International law as npplled to Cuba." Senator Chandler: "I am especially pleas<Hl with the President's evident intention to maintain a policy in the lnterterest of international bimetallism." Senator Hannn: "It !s n statesmanllko and American paper; It Is convincing und will confirm the confidence the pminlrv lina In m?? Uronl.lont Senator Allen, (Pop.): "I do not care to enter upon a criticism of the President* it utterances, but will nay that 1 fall to agree with him on his thre?i prlti cliwil nuggestlons of policy. I do not think It possible to secure the currency legislation which ho recommends." Senator Teller, (Silver Republican): "I don't believe that any legislation will be enacted authorizing th<? retention of the greenbacks in the treasury until somebody is willing to pay gold for them. The radical advocates of the gold standard will not be willing to accept this BUgRCHtlon. nor will <he silver \x\vi\ so far :t3 I am Informed favor this disposition of the financial question." Senator Pettigrrw. (Silver Republican): "The President proposes to retire the greenbacks and In doing no he tries to disguise the method by which It Is to be accomplished. U is plain that If the President's plan is adopted *10 more greenbacks can be In circulation than there is gold in the treasury. Thus tho greenbacks virtually become gold certificates and would be immediately retired." b Accident to ('ongrcMinan Ilrlilrii.

[ PARSONS, W. Va? Dec. C.-Th<? most Important testimony In the Eafitham 1 ...no ? fcW V Mnplf who corroborated the remarkable story 1 told by Cooper ofc the stand last Friday. Cooper Is an old veteran of the Confederate army, and served in the war with Kastham. The defense drew from him on crosH-exnmlnntlon laat Friday that he was Bast ham's nearest neighbor and best friend, and that he had lied from Tuckcr county to llappahannock, at his own expnse, and took refuge with the brothers of East ham there, to avoid being a witness against the accused. While there he had urged the raising of a mob to rescue Eastham from the Jail at Parsons. Mock went with him, and the latter repeated the story with much more today. He said he came from Front Royal, Va., near East ham's old home, several years ago, and had since been a tenant on the prisoner's farm in Tucker county. Easthani had told him many times of his intention to cither break up tho Thompsons or kill both father and son. Kastham had employed witness to blow up the Thompsons* dam in the JJlackwater ont- night, and furnished the dynamite with which it was done. Witness had flred from ambush by Eastham's orders upon those who came to rebuild the dam, with almost fata! effect, using Eastham's Winchester and smokeless powder, provided by the prisoner. The evidence created a sensation and rather rattled the defense. Mock was on the stand all the afternoon. FALSE REPORT. C'otianl I.ee Sent Mo Copy of the CoiiBttlnI ton of the Cubnii IiiMirj(ciita.

LIVELY DEBATE : I In thttiirmiu UclchtUg on tU? Incrcau of the Sluvy-tho KUo l'iiuu luctdcut I* Thuruuglily Aired. *] BERLIN, Dec. C.-r-The Reichstag today began the debate upon the first reading of the government naval bill. The Imperial chancellor, Prince Hohen- \ lohe, made a statement on the subject, saying: 4 t "We absolutely require nn efficient v navy to maintain the position created for us by the army. This conviction has gained ground with very large sec- i tions of the population, and I declare, in the name of the federated governments, that they consider as an impera- t tlve necessity that the navy should bo strengthened und that its strength should bo fixed by legislative enactment." , Herr ffchoenlank, Social Democrat, I opposed the bill, llerr Scho^nlank said hi: thought It curious that the flaws in the navy had only now been discovered. J Attempts were being made, he claimed, to frighten the people with phantoms and excite them to a craving for glory. How. the speaker asked, could thll b?* reconciled with the pacific declarations of the emperor. Referring to the occupation of IviaoChou Buy by the German squadron In Chinese waters, Herr Schoeniank said that if Germany established herself in China she would become Involved In endless complications with (lre.it Brit- . In and Japan. Germany, he claimed, would never be a naval power. The bill, he said, was the outcome of personal rule. County Lamburgh-Stlrum, the Conservative leader, disputed Herr Schoenlank's contention. The minister for foreign affairs, Bar- t on von Bulow, said: i "Herr Schoenlank's fours that -we shall plunge Into adventures are not well grounded. The chancellor and his | colleagues are men not to seek useless j quarrels. AVe don't poke our fingers In- . to every pie, but nevertheless, Gor- | many must not renounce her claim to , have a sharp of the countries havlag a ' rich future. In times past when Gor- < many resigned the land to one neigh- ] bor and the sea to another, she kept for J herself only the heavens, where pure t doctrine dwells. I "The object of the expedition of Kiao- f Chott Bay to obtain satisfaction and < greater guarantees against the repetl- ? tion of such occurrences.

Tn addition to the murder 1 of the two German missionaries whom ! we cannot ullow to be regarded as out- J law#, we have had a number of other j serious grounds for complaint. We can- ( not allow the view to become established in China that Germans can be treat- , ed in a manner \Vhlch other nations do . nut permit. \ "We wish to pUFh no one Into the i shade, but, we demand our share of the | nun. True to the traditions of Herman I policy, we will, without unnecessary t acerbity, but nt the time without weak- < ness. protect our rights and Interests." i (Prolonged cheers.)

The trouble between Germany and Haytl, as a result of the arrest and Imprisonment of Herr Lueders, an alleged German subject, reached ft critical stage today. Two German cruleerf entered thin port during the morning and an ultimatum from the German government was delivered to the Haytlnn government, giving the latter eight hour? In which to grant the demands of Germany for an Indemnity (o Herr Luedere. The members of the diplomatic corps here believe the government of the republic has decided to accept the conditions of Germany. In anticipation of trouble, the cltnene of German nationality sought refuge yesterday on board two steamers which were at tills port and 'the French steamer Vill<* de Marseilles has been requisition d by the French minister In order to servo as a place of refuge for French cMtseim.

WASHINGTON', D. C., Dec. C.-Presdent McKinley sent his annual message o Congress to-day, as follows: fo the Senate and House of Representatives: It gives ifto pleasure to extend greetng to the ilfty-llfth Congress usaeni3led in regular section at tin* seat n' government, with iruny of whose senaors and representatives l have been asloclated in the -legislative service. Phelr meeting occurs under felicitous ondltlons, Justifying sincere congratuation and calling for our grateful aeinowledgement to u. beneficent provlleuce which has so signally blessed and prospered us us u nation. Peace and jdod will with all the vjatUuw of the ?arth continue unbroken. A matter of jenulru satisfaction Is the growing feeing of fraternal regard and unification )( ull sections of our country, the In:ompietnesfl of which lias too long deayed realization of the highest blessngs of the t*nlon. The spirit of patriotism is universal, and Is ever increas iiiff In fervor. The puollc questions which now moat engross us are llf 'ar above either partisanship, prejudice jr former sectional differences. They ifleet every part of our common country alike and permit of no division on tnclent lines. Questions of foreign polcy.of revenue, the soundness of the cur ni'y, the Inviolability of national obi^ati<m.-. the improvement of the pubL service, appeal to tht individual conicienctt of every earnestcltlaen to whatSVer party he belongs ??r in whatever section of the country he may reside. The extra session of thin congress ivhlch liu.-cd during July last enacted important legislation, and while its full ?ffect ban not yet been realized, what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent value further time will be quired and the people, satisfied with ts operation ami rmiits thus far, are ,n no mind to withhold from it a fair ;rial. Tariff legislation having been settled l>y the extra session of congress, thu jucstlon next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. THE CURRENCY QUESTION. The work of putting our finances upon l found basis, difficult as it may seem, ivill appear easier when we recall the llnanrJal operations of the government if Iftflli. (Oi (Iim Itotli ilnv of Jum> of that year wo ha J outstanding demand liabilities In the sum of 572S.SC8.447.4J. On ihe first of January, 1870, these llablllLles hud been reduced to ?t i:i,hs:i,4t?;?.*,S. jt our interest-bearing obligations, the igurt'H are even more striking. On July I, 1SC6, the principal of the interestbearing debt of the government was f2.U2.ttl,SOS. On the first day of July. 1893. this sum had been reduced to $585.1)37.100, or an aggregate reduction of II,747,294,108. The interest-bearing debt ?1* the United States on the first day of December, 1897, was 5847,365,020. The government money now outstanding (December 1) consists of $246,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes issued by authority yf the aw of 1800, J384.P68.604 of silver eertlfl utes, and $01,280,761 of standard silver Sollars. With the great' resources of the government and with the honorable eximple of the past before us, we ought lot U> hesitate to enter upon a cur ency revision which will muke our demand obligations l. ss onerous to the government and relieve our financial aws from ambiguity and doubt. The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 181)3, nakes unreasonable and groundless my dlstriiHt either of our fijjunclal ability or Houndncbs; while the situation from IMS to 1897 must admonish 'ongress of the Immediate necessity of io legislating ns to make tho return of he conditions then prevailing Impossible. Then' are many plans proposed as a emody for the evil. flofore we can find he true remedy we must appreciate the real evil. It is not that our currency >f every kind Is not good, for every dolnr of it Is good: good becnuse the gov rniucnt'M pledge l? out to keep ii so, and that pladge will not be broken. However, the guaranty of our purpose o keep the pledge will be best shown by idvunclng toward its fulfillment. EVIL OF THE PIIK8KNT BV8TKM. The evil of the present system is found In the great cost to the government or sustaining the parity of our llfferent forms of money, thai Is, keep, ng all of them at par with gold. We turely cannot be longer heedless of tho burden thin Imposes upon the onople, 'ven under fairly prosperous conditions, ivhlla the past four years have dementi rated that it Is not only an expensive binge upon the go\eminent but a dangerous menace to thn national credit. It In manifest that we must devise inme plnn to protect the government against bond Issues for repeated re* lemptloiiM. We must either curtail the ipportunlly for speeulntlon, mndy easy l\v the multiplied redemptions of our lemahri obligations, or incrraso the joid u r\? for their redemption.

The gov't nmont without any fixed gold revenue Is I lodged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done and which under the authority now given It will continue to do. The law which requires the govern* mint after having redeemed Its United States notes to pay them out again as lurrent funds demand* * constant replenishment of the gold reserve. This Is especially so In times of business panic and when the revenues are Insufficient to meet the expenses of the Kovernment. At such times the govern* ment hus no other way to supply Its deficit and maintain redemption but through the increase of its bonded debt, as during the administration of my predecessor, when 1262,316,400 of four and a half per cent, bonds were Issued and sold and the proceeds used to pay the expenses of the government In excess of the revenues and sustain th# gold reserve.
