CAPTURED BY DEATH HEROIC OLD CUBAN CAPITULATES AT LAST. GEN. GARCIA NO MORE passes Away in Washington From an Attack of Pneumonia —A Large Family Left—One Son With Him at the End —Interment to be in Cuba. Washington, Dec. 13. —General Cai ixto Garcia, che distinguished Cuban warrior and leader and the head of the commission elected by the Cuban assembly to visit this country, died of pneumonia Sunday morning at Hotel Raleigh, where the commis sion has its headquarters. He leaves a large family, only one of whom, Justo, a captain on his staff, was with him when he died. His widow and Mercedes, a daughter 17 years of age, are at Thomasville. Ga., where the girl is quite ill; Maria, a son, 19 years of age, is with the mother at Thomas ville, and Colonel Carlos Garcia, an other son, is in Cu p oa. A daughter Leonora, who married an America *■ is now living in Paris, General Gar cia’s mother is still alive and resides] in Havana. The burial when it finally i occurs will be in Cuba, He was un- i conscious for 12 hours. General Gar cia was one of the three central fig-] ures in Cuba's grand struggle for lib- j erty. The other two are Maximo (,ioraez, the cooiamnder-in-ohief of the j revolutionary fofc&S, and Antonio; Macedv til ft dead general, who was snared and killed by the treachery of the Spanish. Like Gome* and Maceo, he was baptized with the blood and fire of the Cuban revolution of 1868. Like them, he unhesitatingly returned to give up his blood and if need be his life when his country called him the second time. Had the Cuban wars been wars of a big nation, instead of a small island, Garcia would have been a military hero. Gomez will latex share the same honor and glory, and Maceo had done so, too, had he lived General Garcia was 60 years old. In 1868, when Cuba rose against Spain, he was one of the earliest of the con spirators. It was on the 10th day of October of that year that he started on the warpath. He led a band of 150 patriots, and started upon a march of destruction from Holguin. His little army was victorious from the first. It took every town it assailed, and its numbers swelled as the march proceeded. Santa Rita and Baire fell before the dashing rebels. Jiguani, with its population of 20,000 capitu lated, and Garcia was made a briga dier general under Gomez, who was then, as now, the commander-in-chief. When the new provisional govern ment of Cuba went into effect during the first revolution Gomez was re moved and Garcia took his place. The Spaniards had meanwhile retaken liguani and Garcia addressed himself to the task of remaking his conquest of the city. Once his victorious sol diers marched on the city and again it fell before him. His ambition was now to take Holguin, consecrated to him by his early conspiracies there and the fact that it was from that city that he set out ou his march of vic tories. The unconquerable young man set his head toward Holguin and took it by storm. His name was wax ing great. The record of his victories from that time on is a glorious one. Bu agan, Cupijal, Zarsal and Santa Maria were overridden and beaten into sur render, During this short but very brilliant compalgu several prominent Spanish officers were killed and others taken prisoners. His work after that was often crowned with victory, al though he sometimes met defeat. In 1873 the force of overwhelming num bers drove him back and his capture by the Spanish was inevitable. He had little faith in Spain's clemency, and while his pursuers were in sight of him he placed the muzzle of his pistol in his mouth and fired. 1 The bullet tore its way to his palate and came out through the skin of his head. His enemies were certain that he was dead and carried oil the body. Garcia revived and gained complete recovery. His attempt at self-destruction prob ably saved his life. He was sent to Spain and was kept in prison until, at the request of Campos, he was re leased. He spent a short time in Paris and thence went to New York. But the rebellion was not yet completely crushed, and Garcia made one more mad dash against tyranny, all to no purpose. He was again captured, but was again released, this time by Blanco. The general was deported to Madrid, where he lived until 3876 under the eyes of the police. When the last revolution broke out General Gomez was tendered the chief tainship of the Cuban forces. It may well be imagined how intense was Garcia’s desire to return to the scenes of his early triumphs. He set to work to outwit the police, which he did by laughing at the idea of the Cu ban revolution, and while denouncing the rebels made outward preparation to stay in Madrid indefinitely. Then one nignl he suddenly slipped out of Madrid and was soon safe in Paris. He returned to America and was taken up by the junta and sent to the field as a brigadier general. Garcia’s most important achieve ment. so far as direct results are con cerned. was the capture of Guaimaro in December, 1596. After a siege of twelve days he captured sixteen forts, one after another, finally forcing the surrender of the garrison, who took refuge in a large stone church in the center of the town. He opened on them with a couple of field pieces and speedily captured the forces, amount ing to nearly 300 men and officers. There was much booty, consisting of Spanish gold, Mauser rifles, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, with machetes and a large supply of clothing. The prisoners were well treated and soon allowed to go on parole. Again Gar cia's humane generalship won him plaudits from the enemy.

DWIGHT'S Judge Taft Easily Among the Possi bilities. New Haven, Conn.. Dee. 13.—The resignation of President Timothy Dwight as head of Yale university will doubtless be acted upon today, as lie insists upon it. There is no candidate who can be singled out as his sure suc cessor. Prof. George Trumbull Ladd, head of the department of philosophy. has been mentioned. Prof. Ladd came to Yale fifteen years ago from a pulpit in Minneapolis. There is a tradition that only a UonapKgan’onal clergyman can be elected Yale's president. In this respect PfOi, Ladd would make a typical head for the university. He is a deep theological student, but it is certain that the business men who are members of the corporation would pre fer a younger man of the business type. Prof. GeOrge Burton of the his tory department, Prof. Henry W. Farnham of the department of sociolo gy and Prof. Edward S. Dana of the department of natural science are the leading candidates in the eyes of the younger alumni. Of these FTof. Dana has the advantage in his ancestry. He is the sen of the late venerable Janies D. Dana. Another prominent candi- Judge Taft. date is Judge W. H. Taft, judge of the United States circuit'court of appeals in Cincinnati. President Dwight in speaking of his resignation says: “i have no particu lar plans for the immediate future. Of course I shall serve out the year, but beyond that I do not know what 1 shall do except to take a rest. Yes, I shall remain here in New Haven to make my home as a quiet citizen, and 1 hope to die here.” When asked if he would give any thought to reconsid ering his resignation, as the corpora tion has requested, he replied: “1 shall certainly give the kind request the consideration that courtesy and gratefulness dictate, but I think that I must abide by the expression I made in my letter.”

PLATT WILL REPLY TO HIM Connecticut Senator Says Vest Wrong ly Interprets Constitution and Makes Inaccurate Deductions from the Law —Bill Introduced Allowing A. A. Bartlett to Raise Maine. Washington, Dec. 13.—The discus sion ox two questions, each of interest and importance at this time —terri- torial expansion and the construction of the Nicaraguan canal —was begun by the senate Monday. Mr. Vest (dem. Mo.) called up his resolution offered last week, declaring it unconstitutional for this government to acquire foreign territory except for coaling stations or some like purpose, unless the intention was to confer statehood upon the terri tory and citizenship upon the inhab itants. Mr. Vest declared it was a basic principle of this government that the “powers of the government are de rived from the consent of the gov erned,- ’ and he maintained that the fed eral government had no authority, either in morals or in constiutiou to go beyond that principle. He held that the principle has been sustained by the 1 supreme court in various decisions, and hO public man of prominence had ever been reckless enough to controvert it. Mr, Vest thought ii Wde file purpose of the expansionists to adopt the Euro pean system of colonization, notwith standing the fundamental principle of this government was the granting of citizenship to all within the jurisdic tion of the government, except alone the Indians. In the act of the cession of the territory of Louisiana by the French to the United States, one provi sion was that the inhabitants, as soon as possible, be made citizens of the United States, and the territory of Louisiana be made a state of the union. So it was declared, Mr. Vest said, when Oregon was obtained from Spain and Alaska from Russia. Mr. Vest declared that the United States supreme court had settled the question for all time. “I do not deney,” continued Mr. Vest, “the power of the federal government to acquire territory, but 1 do deny the power to acquire territory peopled with millions without their consent, and with no intention of conferring upon them citizenship.” “We are a great people,” concluded Mr. Vest. “We are told this country can do anything, constitution or no constitution. We are a great people, it is true, but we cannot do more than another great people did —people that conquered the world. It is an appendage of monarchy. It can exist in no free country, because it eliminates the basis of all republican institutions — a government derives just powers from the consent of the governed. I know not what may be done with the glamour of foreign conquest and the greed of the money-making classes of this country. For myself, I would rather quit public life this minute — nay, 1 would be willing to yield life it self —-rather than give my consent to this fantastic, wicked attempt to revo lutionize our government and substi tute principles of an hereditary enemy for the teachings of Washington and his associates.” Mr. Platt (rep., Conn.) took issue with Mr. Vest. He announced that at some time in the near future he would offer some remarks upon the resolu tion, in course of which he would en deavor to show the Missouri senator was wrcog in his interpretation of the constitution and inaccurate in his de ductions' from the law. Mr. Morgan (.dem., Ala.) opened the debate on the canal bill. The whole country, he said, would be disappointed u congress did not act. He was will ing to take any measure which would result in the building of the canal. In the course of his remarks he agreed to accept an amendment specifically excepting the canal from neutrality with regard to any country with which the United States might be at war. Morgan said the language of the bill specifically excepted such cases. Mr. Hoar (rep., Mass.) differed With Mr. Morgan. “If the United States were at war with England and Eng land should dispatch a hostile fleet to San Francisco, could that fleet pass through without interruption?” asked Mr. Hoar. Morgan said no that nation would misunderstand the language of the bill, but he was willing to accent any language that would make our right more specific. Mr. Hoar sug gested that the clause relating to the neutrality of the canal be amended to read: “Except as to nations, at war with the United States.” Mr. Morgan said that he would accept the amend ment as no senator would vote against the bill on \his account. Mr. Morgan said that a president in whom congress wisely entrusted a fund of $50,000,000 to be used “at his discre tion,” could certainly be trusted to overcome the objections of Nicaragua or U' Rica or the stockholders of the Maritime Canal company. Mr. Morgan said that his plea was for ac tion. This bill did not seek to build a canal, it simply placed the question in the hands of the president. Messrs. Hoar and Hale presented re monstrances of citizens of their states against the taking of the Philippines or any other territory without the con sent of the people of such territory. Mr. Pettigrew introduced a bill authorizing A. A. Barrlfttt to raise the battleship Maine and transport it to the United States. 

HOUSE. Washington,. Dec. 13. —In the house Mr. Hepburn (rep., la.) introduced a joint resolution proposing an amena raent to the constitution as follows: “Xo hew r state, the territory of which was not part of the United States and under its jurisdiction and sovereignty on January 1, 189S, shall be admitted into the union until three-fourths of the members elected to each house of congress shall vote affirmatively for such admission.” It was referred to the judiciary committee. Mr. Hepburn also introduced a bill authorizing the president to acquire by purchase from the states of Costa Rica and Nicaragua full ownership, jurisdiction and sov ereignty of the land desirable and nec essary to construct an isthmian ship canal. The president is also directed to construct such canal and the bill ap propriates $140.00.00 to complete it. The house devoted most of its session to District of Columtua business. EAU 

CLAIRE WANTS A COLLEGE. Ript.<i Institution Receives a Tempt ing Offer to Move. Ripon. Wis., Dec. 13. —Eau Claire is ambitious to become a college city. The offer of one of its residents of SIOO,OOO, with a proviso that sloo,uoo additional be raised by the citizens of the town for the transfer of Ripon college to the lumbering metropolis on the banks of the Wisconsin, has been made and created more or less a stir amcog Ripon people. Between 

SIO,OOO and $20,000 is spent here annually by the students alone. The iucompleted science hall is the immediate cause of the talk about removing the college. Ten thousand dollars more is needed for that building. The offer of SIOO.- 000 from the Eau Claire man was for the purpose of a science hall, the other SIOO,OOO being his offer for the rest of the buildings. The $200,000 probably does not cover the value of property, and there may be technical obstacles to prevent a removal of the college to Eau Claire. DOCTORS ERR AGAIN UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE SMALLPOX AT NEBRASKA CITY. MANY CASES DISCOVERED Disease Has Been Prevalent in Ne braska City Since Last August—lt Has Now Spread to Neighboring Towns and Something of a Panic Prevails —Eight Cases in Omaha.

WILL DEFEAT YERKES OPPONENTS OF FRANCHISE EX TENSION SHOW STRENGTH. FIRST ROUND IN COUNCIL Friend,- of the Ordinance Unable to Prevent us Recall from One Com mittee and Its Resubmission to An other —Probability Now Is That It Won't Pass. Chicago, Dec. 13. —The ordinance ex tending the franchises of the Chicago street car companies for fifty years came up in the city council last night and was referred to the council com mittee on railroads. Thus Yerkes, principal owner of the street car com panies, has lost the first round in the big fight. Cu all votes touching the ordinance the friends of the measure were in a strong minority, and unless they can muster much greater strength, there is no that they will ever be able to pass it over the veto of Mayor Harrison. Con trary to the general expectation there was little excitement around the city hall uid although the council cham ber was packed to suffocation and crowds filled the outside corridors, the number of people present was but little larger than usual. The crowd was, however, against the franchise propo sition to a man, and made no pretense of keeping its convictions secret. The adherents of the franchise were openly hissed when they attempted *,o gain a poisit for their measure, and loud yells greeted the announcement of the vote by which the ordinance was referred. The crowd, however, was good-natured and there was no demon stration. The railway committee which now has the ordinance is com posed of thirteen members, eleven of whom voted last night as friends of the franchise extension. The ordi nance, at the previous meeting, had been referred to the joint committees on streets and alleys and last night Al derman Walsh introduced a resolution providing that the vote by which the ordinance was referred to the joint committee be reconsidered. Aider man O'Brien, who is the champion of the street car companies, moved to lay Walsh’s resolution on the table. This motion was lost, 37 to 26. Mayor Har rison then referred the ordinance to the committee on railroads. Alderman Malt r oy introduced a resolution that no ordinance whatever, extending the street railway franchises, shall be passed, and that no proposals to that end shall be entertained unless the so called Allen law shall have been re pealed and he moved a suspension of the rules to permit its consideration. This was defeated by a vote of 38 to 25. 

TRAGEDY IN ALABAMA CAMP. Fight Between a Cook and a Bugler Ends in Death of Both. Huntsville, Ala.. Dec. 13. —Henry Nelligan, cook, and George Beverly, bugler, both of Cos. G, Ist Florida, were killed Sunday night. Nelligan and Beverly were on bad terms and had a fight in camp. Nelligan drew a knife and stabbed Beverly, who pulled out a pistol and told him to stand back. Nel ligan’s brother seeing Beverly with a pistol in his hand killed him with a Springfield rifle. Beverly’s brother Roy, emerged from a tent and saw his brother fall. Thinking he had been killed by the cook. Nelligan, he shot the cook dead. Private Porter Weis nant, troop D. 10th cavalry, was found with a bullet wound in his throat. He spoke oaly a few words after he was found. He stated that he had been held up by two white soldiers and shot THREE CUBANS KILLED. Blood Spilled in Havana as Result of Garcia’s Death. Havana, Dec. 12, Three Cubans were killed and one Spanish officer and two Cubans wounded Sunday night in au affray between some Spanish officers off duty and a number of citizens and a party of Cubans who wished to close the Tacc-n theater on account of the death of Gen. Garcia at Washington. Spanish troops on duty intervened, and restored order. After the news of Garcia's death spread through Havana early Sunday evening, the Cubans wished to have all places of amusement closed. They succeeded in closing two places fre quented by Cubans, but the'manage ment of the Tacon theater, where there were many Spanish officers among the audience, refused to close the house. Thereupon Allegrette, former captain of insurgent troops, got into an excited argument with the manager of the cheater and Allegrette was escorted to the sidewalk by the police of the city. There Allegrette en tered into a heated discussion with a Spanish officer, who struck him across the face with the flat of his sword. Then there was a collision between the Cubans and Spanish military men; mot.. blows tvere struck on both sides and many persons cheered for Spain and brought crowds of people to the spot from the adjacent streets and squares. Suddenly a shot was fired; whether by Cuban or Spaniard, inten tentionally or accidentally, cannot be said. The Cubans retreated into the Hotel Inglaterra. More shots were fired on both sides. Arturo Tizet, a Frenchman •born in Havana, was shot and seriouoly wounded while sitting at a table. The Cubans ran through the hotel office aod made their way up stairs. Jesus Sotolongo, a Cuban, fell wounded on the stairs; another wounded man broke into a room occu pied by Lieutenant Fitzhugh Lee, son ; of the general, demanding protection. General Greene and several member- i of his staff, who had been out on the balcony watching the crowd, heard the uproar in the hotel and went into the j corridor. As soon as the Spanish offi .Pt-s rfreene'. they storoed their pursuit of the Cubans, saluted and re-. r ired. In the meantime, Eastaquio; Lemus had been fatally wounded in j the street and Heso Blesa and Anoj .Tiniinez killed. Shortly afterwards' the Spanish guards on duty swarmed in from the neighboring streets and order was restored. It is reported that in addition to those killed and wound ed, who have been previously men tioned, fourteen are being cared for in private houses. The 222d New York regiment landed Monday morning, and marched from the San Jose wharf to the Christina railroad station. Some troops belong ing to this detachment are bound for the city of Pinar del Rio. IS miles from here. Others will be stationed at Mariel, not far from here, in the prov ince of Pinar del Rio. IS PIGQUART OUT? Report Thar His Release Has Been Ordered. Paris, Dec. 13. — La Liberie says that the temporary releace of Lieut. Col. Picquart has been ordered. The charges against Picquart grow out of the Dreyfus case and are based on the disclosures which he made to the Dreyfus adherents. He is also charged with forgery of military documents, but this accusation will probably not be pressed when finally the case comes to trial. The courtmartial of Picquart may be conducted by a secret military tribunal, and Paris looks for sensa- Col. Picquart. tional develppments during its contin uance. In fact there are those who believe that both the Dreyfus and anti- Dreyfus adherents will bring about papula; demonstrations which may and in a sanguinary conflict and the enactment of scenes like those of the commune of 1871. * THE SENATE SAVED HIM. Rivera Owes His Life to Action of American Solons. New York, Dec. 13. —General J. Ruis Rivera, the Cuban recently liberated by the Spanish government from Cue ta, was a pasenger on the steamer Lc Champagne from Havre, which ar rived Monday. Gen. Rivera was greet ed by his wife, Gen. Thomas Estrada Palma, acid a few other Cubans. “The resolution passed by the United States senate,” said Rivera, "soon after my capture in Cuba, March, 1897, surely saved me from being court-martialed and shot. As it was, I was never tried at all, but in secret ordered to be im prisoned for life in a Spanish fortress. While in the hands of the enemy some times I was treated well, and others pretty badly. When the protocol was signed, Gen. Fernandez, governor of the fort ress, became more friendly to me. He had me changed to a hospital, where I was fairly well cared for. Next came my unconiliticaal release. In the course of the next few months I will go to free Cuba, and live in peace.” Rivera and Palma left in the afternoon for Washington to attend the funeral of Garcia. COLUMBUS’ ASHES MOVED.

London, Dec. 9. —Joseph Chamber lain, at a conservative gathering at Wakefield. Yorkshire, last evening, fully discussed home and foreign af fairs and the government's policy In Egypt, which he said, depended en tirely upon the possibility of reaching an understanding with France, “A thing impossible so long as the French pursue a policy of exasperation.” In regard to relations ‘between Great Brit ain and Russia, in connection with the far east, he said that while hitherto endeavors to reach an agreement had failed, he believed an agreement with Russia necessary, unless very serious complications are to be encountered. There were, he continued, no insur mountable obstacles to such an agree ment. "I acn more sanguine of arriving at a settlement. said Mr. Chamberlain, “because it is not for our interest alone. The objects that we have in view are shared also by the United States, Germany and Japan; all have identical interests. I dare say that you observed a very pregnant passage in the recent message of President Mc- Kinley, referring to the very important interests of America in the east, in which he declares that these interests shall not be prejudiced by exclusive treatment. That is a very noteworthy passage and, without being a prophet. I think that I shall not be too sanguine if I say that in the future, we shall not stand alone as guardians of the ‘open door.’"”
