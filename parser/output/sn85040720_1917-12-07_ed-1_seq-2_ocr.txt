In speaking of “The Benefit of Ath letics for the Student” Judge Karel said: “Athletics, propel ly interpreted, form a very important adjunct to school life. “While the school work is of para mount importance, the value and ne cessity of recreation for a full round ed character is recognized by nearly everyone. Recreation must be exerise, yet it must have another incentive than exercise; it must be a spontan eous action of which the exercise is a mere incidental part. In athletics, w T here a spirit of contest and rivalry exist, these conditions obtain. “The benefits of athletics to the student who participates is seldom questioned, but it is urged that ath letics are a benefit only to the few w T ho may take part in the contest. This, in a great degree is due to the student’s lack of confidence in him self. Never having tried he does not think himself capable of doing any thing in the athletic line. To be sure some students have a greater natural aptitude for athletics than others, yet those who achieve final success are often the ones who have started seem ingly without hope of success and have persisted, rather than those wiio have shown the aptitude at first. So no one should refrain from entering athletics because he has no record. “Then, too, the more who enter the contests the more benefit each one ob tains. The benefit comes chiefly to two classes, but these two classes com pose almost the entire student body. The first is composed of those who have school work alone to do, and en ter athletics as their only method of physical exercise the second class, those who have other exercises but enter athletics as a means of recrea tion. “The results of the training itself are very beneficial, certain food, cer tain hours for exercise and sleep, are required of the athlete, and by fulfill ing these requirements his physical condition is improved, and he is in better condition to stand the strain of school work. He will accomplish more, spending less time on his lessons. “Again, the benefits are not phy sical alone. The restraint, self-denial, the quickness of perception, the rapid decision necessary to success, and the self confidence obtained are benefits which leave a lasting impression on character.” “For success in football one must .

This needs to be guarded against, for ath letics, while good under control, are bad when master.” Captain Henke Speaks. Speaking for the football team, Captain Fred Henke said: In behalf of the team I wish to thank the Elks for the honor they have done us tonight. If we are not already the champions then surely the good wmrk of our coach, the en couragement given by our superin tendent and instructors, and the in spiration of this affair will surely bring us back victors. We promise to play a clean, strong winning game and above all will so conduct our selves so as to reflect credit on us and honor upon our good parents and teachers. We are proud of our city and we will fight at Green Bay to bring added honor and glory to Wa tertown and to make all of its citi zens proud of us. In biding you good night let me say —We are going. We are coming back and we are going to be the champions.

NEWS GIVES PUBLIC WILSON'S MESSAGE EXCLUSIVELY HERE The Watertown News published ex clusively on Wednesday the full text of President Wilson’s message to congress the afternoon before. As us ual the Watertown News made ar rangements to cover this big event and gave the greatest message ever delivered by a president of the United States to the world to its Watertown readers a few hours following the de livery and in the first issue of the pa per following its presentation to con gress. This message was the most im portant and momentous address to the world ever penned by man, and the News covered the field in Watertown exclusively. In this message President Wilson clearly sets out the aims and objects of the nation in the worm war In which most of the civilized countries of the world are engaged. It should be spread broadcast all over the earth as advocating and breathing the hopes and aspirations of mankind. That the News was the first in the local field to give its readers the text of this important document only serves to show that this paper will render the best possible news service, both national, state and local that can be secured. In an effort to establish a newspa per in Watertown we have been as sailed at divers times. The principle of live and let live seems to be lost to the senses of some malcontents. After being clouted right and left for being in existence we are assailed as being the organ of Mayor Mulberger and then again of being the organ of Governor Philipp. If either of the gen tlemen are on our subscription lists it is news to the editor.. However, let that pass. Mayor Mul berger may be a candidate for mayor next spring, and he may not. If he is, he will receive a handsome endorse ment by the people as a worthy suc cessor to a fine administration of pub lic 'affairs. The News is the organ of only one man while the war lasts, and his name is Uncle Sam. We have done our bit in every way we were called upon and gladly will do more and all within our power. No politics will creep up in national affairs*while President Wilson is guid ing the ship of state. He represents the people of these United States and he will be upheld by all lovers of liberty and democracy, both at home and abroad. For some reason best known to him self, the editor of the Daily Times has seen fit repeatedly to assail in the columns of his paper the man whro preceded him in the conduct of that paper twenty-one years and who sold his interests in* good faith. The News hts attended strictly to its own affairs and has not meddled with what con cerned the other sheet, but repeated attacks upon us calls for a statement, and we beg the indulgence of our readers in bringing this matter to public attention and we will not again trespass upon them in this respect.
