Justus Dartt, who has long and faithfully held the oflice of State Superintendent of Schools, retires, and his place is given to Mr. Palmer of AVaterbury.a gentleman well spok en of and well esteemed. Mr. Dartt has done very faithful and accepta ble work, and he has a great many friends in the state who will regret his departure from this important field of labor. The Republican state committee of West Virginia has offered a re ward of $2,000 for the detection of frauds on the ballot in Kanawha and "Wetzel counties. These frauds con sist in altering the returns. Expert detectives have also been employed to ferret out the rascals. The re publicans of West Virginia having won an election evidently mean to maintain it. The Burlington Free Press is now printed on a Webb perfecting press, that prints and folds 12000 papers in an hour. It is a great stroke of en terprise and prosperity that brings one of these mammoth machines in to Vermont and we congratulate our cotemporary on the event. It is one of the staunchest of papers and deserves the new press as well as the new dress in which it appears. John C. New, to whom men as cribe the "making of Harrison Pres ident," says : "I have never spoken a word to Gen. Harrison about his cabinet, and don't expect to unless he broaches the subject to me. I don't think it is any of my business and I know that Gen. Harrison thinks the same thing. You won't find any Indiana people running to Harrison about his cabinet. They know bet ter." The Direct Tax bill, which provides for the refunding of the balances due from the general govrnment to sev eral States that advanced money to it during the war, may perhaps cause another deadlock in Washington. The democrats, and especially the Southerners, will fight it tooth and nail. The money got from the direct tax was employed to put down the rebellion, and of course the South ern States will get none of the money that is refunded. Congress Reassembles. The second session of the Fiftieth Congress reassembled Monday. It ought to be an historical session as it rounds the first hundred years of the legislative life ot the republic The first session has passed into history, and significant history it is It will be noted as a congress in which the men lately in the rebellion obtained control in the House, and attempted, with the executive help, to carry things with a high and in solent hand. The so-called Mills bill was forced through the house with as much plotting and domineering as characterized the famous Kansas Nebraska bill. Beaten by the non-action of the Senate an appeal was taken to the country. There the bill and its pro jectors have met with a defeat which not only makes a change in the office of President but a change in the control of the House. If proper effect should be given to these chang es, there will be no attempt to re vive the Mills bill. It is discredited and disowned by the country. That is the verdict, and there ought to be sense enough on the part of the ways and means committe of the House to so read the decision. It is hardly expected that they will. They have only shown conceit and insolence so far, and such men rarely learn even in the school of experience. Unless the House takes up and passes the Senate bill there will be no tariff legislation at this session. In the face of the verdict of Nov. 6, it is not only idle but preposterous to talk about passing the Mills bill. The bill is dead and buried. Should the Senate bill not be passed this winter, a called session of the Fifty first Congress may become advis able. That will depend on the at titude of the House Democrats this winter. The President's Message. Following is a f till abstract of the pres ident's message. After calling attention to the fact that the present session of congress ends the first century of our constitutional existence, he says in retro spect : The guh' between employers and the employed is constantly widening, and the classes are rapidly forming, one compris ing the very rich and powerful, while in another is found the toiling poor. As we view the achievements of aggregated cap ital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while the tizen is struggling far In the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should be the care fully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becom ing the people's masters. While congrat ulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country and complacent ly contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to Inquire at the present stage of our progress how the bond of the government, made with the people has been kept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens, to the necessities of economical administration, the govern ment persists in exacting from the sub stance of the people millions which, un applied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury. Under the same laws by which these results are produced, the government permits many millions more to be added to the cost of the living of our people, and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a small, but powerful, minority, the people must still be taxed for the support of the government, under the operation of tariff laws, and to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose, and for the benefit of a favored few. The gov ernnient, under pretext of an exercise of its taxing powers, enters gratuitously into partnership with these favorites to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of onr people. This is not equality before the law. THE 

ACTUAL SITUATION. Our farmers, long-suffering and patient, will not fail to see, in spite of misiepre seutations and misleading fallacies, that they are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foreign mar kets, where they compete with the farm ers of the world, that their lands are de clining in value while their debts increase ; and that without compensating favor they are forced by the action of the gov ernment to pay for the benefit of others such enhanced prices for the things they need, that the scanty returns of their la bor fail to furnish their support or leave no margin for accumulation. Our work ingmeu, no longer deluded by the cry of lower wages, will demand, through such revision, steadier employment, cheaper necessities, freedom for themselves and children from the doom of perpetual ser vitude and an open door to their advance ment beyond the limits of a laboring class, citizens of moderate salaries and fixed incomes will also insist upon cheap ening the cost of necessities. Commun ism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized government, but the communism of combined wealth, and cap ital, the outgrowth of overweening cu pidity and selfishness, which insiduously undermines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not less dangerous than the communism of oppressed pov erty which, exasperated by injustice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule-. A just aud sensible KEVISIOX OF THE TAKIFF laws should be made for the relief of those our couutrymen who suffer under present conditions. Such a revision should receive the support of all who have that justice and equality due to American citizenship ; of all who realize that in this justice and equality our gov ernment finds its trength and its power to protect the citizen and his property ; of all who believe that the contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a few; who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our people, which recognize the value of every American interest, are the surest guaranty of our national progress ; and of all who desire to see the products of American skill and ingenuity in every market in the world, with a resulting res toration of American commerce. There should be no cessation of the struggle until a plan is effected, fair and conserva tive, towards existing industries, reduc ing the cost of necessaries, providing free raw materials and permitting no in jury to labor. appropriations. Appropriation bills for the support of the government are defaced by items and provisions to meet private ends, and it is freely asserted by responsible and experi enced parties, that a bill appropriating money for public internal improvements would fail to meet with favor unless it contained items, more for local and pri vate advantage than for public benefit. Devotion to the public good, the presi dent says, will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of constitutional limita tions of federal power, and to persistent ly check the increasing tendency to ex tend the scope of federal legislation into the domain of state and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving the public welfare. The preservation of the parti tions between proper subjects of federal and local care and regulation, is of such importance under the constitution, which is the law of our very existence, that no consideration of expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter on doubtful grounds. The president here quotesfrom Presi dent Jackson to the effect that he desires also to restore unimpaired the sacred trust confided to his charge and persuade his countrymen that it is not in a splendid government supported by powerful mo nopolies and aristocratic establishments that they will find happiness and liberty, but in a plain system protecting all and favoring none. Such a government only will preserve unity, prosperity and free dom. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. During the year our foreign relations have been improved by mutual good of fices, treaties and reciprocal extradition of criminals. The question between Great Britain and the United States relating to the rights of American fishermen, under treaty and international comity, in the territorial waters of Canada and New foundland, he regrets are not satisfac torily adjusted, and says this matter was fully treated in his message of February last, and the proceedings in connection therewith have been transmitted for the approval of the senate. Comment upon or repetition of them he considers un necessary at this time. He refers to his effort to settle by treaty the long-stand ing fishery dispute, asserts that he be lieves the rejected treaty did furnish a satisfactory, final and practical adjust ment upon an honorable basis, alludes to his unavailing recommendation of oth er legislation to settle the difficulty and again invokes the earnest and immediate attention of congress to the matter for the settlement of which he is deeply so licitous. Regarding the Sackville-West episode the president promises to lay the cor respondence before con&ressrwhicfeJ he says, .will show the unpardonable con duct of Lord Sackville in interfering with the suffrages of American citizens in the very crisis of the presidential election, and his subsequent public declaration to justify his action, impugning the execu tive and senate in important questions now pending between the two govern ments. 

OTHER INTERESTS. The president deplores the state of affairs in Hayti, and has instructed the United States minister to abstain from interference between the warring fac tions, but to protect American property and citizens. Measures have been adopt ed to prevent aud redress any molesta tion regarding seizures of vessels under the American flag. Relations of special and beneficial intercourse have been cre ated with Hawaii, under the treaty of Jnne 3, 1875. He recommends subma rine communication with Honolulu, the geographical position of which creates a natural independency and mutuality of interests. A careful revision of naturalization laws is recommended, to prevent well known abuses resulting from immigra tion and international complications like ly to arise therefrom. 

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC LANDS. Referring to the report of the secretary of the interior, he says : "We have no excuse for the violation of principles co gently taught by reason and example." He proudly retrospects the work, done during the past four years toward re storing the public domain for the use of actual settlers, over 80,000,000 acres having been wrested from illegal usur pation. He hopes that not even desert lands will be allowed to fall into the hands of monopolies, but will, with their sources of irrigatiou, be preserved for the people's benefit. He recommends approiate measures to compiete the ad justment of the various grants made to states for internal improvement, as well as to adjudicate and determine the valid ity and extent of private claims. An early adjustment of the relations between the government and the rail roads which have received land grants is urged, and should be dealt with soley as a business proposition, with a view to a final realization of its indebtedness by the government rather than as a ques tion to be decided upon prejudice or by way of puuishment for previous wrong doidg. The message concludes: "The con sciousness that I have presented but an imperfect statement of the condition .of our country and its wants occasions no fear that anything ommited is not known and appreciated by the congress, upon whom rests the responsibility of intelli gent legislation on behalf of a great na tion and of confiding people." Mr Fditor : I wish to express at least one soldier's gratitude for the kind and courteous manner in which you mentioned the name of Col. G. G. Benedict, in last issue of Monitor in regard especially to his fitness for Collector of Customs for Vermont. For one, those are my sentiments, and so far as I am able to" judge by conversation with com rades and leading men in this vicin ity, no name in the list of those men tioned for the place fills the bill so completely. Please keep this mat ter befor the people in your own good way, that our honorable states men in congress may know for a fact that Mr. Benedict is the choice of the majority. J. S. D. The Future of the Republican Party. The republican party never had a fairer outlook than the present. It has been returned to power, after si brief interval of four years, with such an expression of popular confidence in its promises and principles as the people have seldom given. Its can didates won in spite of the fact that the power of official patronage was against it ; the democratic candidates were defeated in spite of the fact that the immense patronage of the gov ernment was in their favor. The una nimity of the South for democracy has been more than matched by the substantial unanimity of the North and west for republicanism. The republican party touched the lowest point in the scale of power in 1884. Since then it has begun to rise again. It received its first severe blow during Hayes' administration. The new policy which Mr. Hayes adopted toward the South, though a wise and necessary policy, was disas trous to the republican party in that section. The reaction, by suppress ing the colored, or republican vote, made the South solid for the demo cratic party, which became once more a formidable rival in the struggle for national ascendancy. The republic an parly won with Garfield ; but it was defeated with Blaine. It needed in 1884 but a straw to turn the bal ances for Cleveland, and an unwise nomination was that straw. Then came the real opportunity of the dem ocratic party ; but feeling secure, with the South solid in its support, it forgot or repudiated its promises, gave the South undue prominence in the government, attacked the princi ple of protection from a southern standpoint, and manifested the ut most indifference respecting the mon strous crime against the franchise in the South. The party that repudi ates its pledges to the people will it self be repudiated by the people. This is the explanation, in large part, of the defeat of the democratic party. Its candidates were unpopular, its principles objectionable and its prom ises discredited. The republican party, on the contrary, brought for ward its best men, and stood for the defense of American interests and the rights of the people. Its fortunes are again in the ascendant, and its lease of power may be long if it proves worthy of the trust confided to it. The Solid South must become less and less a dominant power political ly. If it made the democratic fortune in 1884, it failed to maintain it in 1888. Four years hence it will be a smaller factor in the contest, even if it remains unbroken. Several states in the Northwest will be admitted be fore that date, and a new appoint ment will have been made on the ba sis of the census of 1890. The great est growth of population is in the states classified as republican. The North and West will therefore have most of the additional votes in the electoral college, the South gaining but few, if any. Moreover, the South can hardly remain unbroken. Vir ginia and West Virginia, North Caro lina and Florida are almost sure to become republican before 1892. Mis souri is not hopelessly democratic, nor is it impossible that Tennessee should become republican. The South must break for its own sake, and a good republican administration for the next four years will surely help it to break. Independent. Sam Small and The Third Party. At a temperance meeting in New York Sunday Sam Small spoke as fol lows : When Sam Small goes into a fight hereafter, he is going to do some thing. Some one is going to get hit and some one is going to get hurt. I don't believe in National Prohi bition politics. Hereafter I am going to have something practical about my principles, about my vote and about what I do. Principle is worth more to me than all the parties that ever tramped the globe. The liquor dealers don't care for party. They elect the men that will favor their cause, of whatever party they may be. I don't believe in letting the devil's crowd get ahead of me on a proposition of common sense. We prohibitionists have held the balance of power in 32 congressional districts, and we might have used our power to have men put into office fa vorable to prohibition. But the pro hibition party has constantly run in dependent tickets, instead of joining some other party, and as a conse quence we have no representation. We have also held the balance of pow er in several of the states, but we have lost our opportunity because we have placed party above principles. When we begin to do something the newspapers will begin to talk about it, the politicians will be hustling on account of it, and we will be getting some victories. Nationally, I think all the flowery, roseate ideas of hav ing a Prohibition President, and our marching up to the White House and drinking his health in pure cold water, will not be realized for a long time. The Postmaster-General's annual report to congress shows that the gross revenue for the year was $52, 696,176. The total expenditures were $56,885,403. The estimated deficiency, therefore, is $4,190,227. The total number of post-offices is 57,376, an increase over 1885 of 6,124. The number of postmasters appointed during the year ended June 30th, 1888, was 12,288, of which 6,521 were upon resignations and commissions expired, 1,244 upon removals, 659 to fill vacancies by death and 3,684 on establishment of new post-offices. One thousand six hundred and forty-five post-olfices were discontinued during the year. In the railway mail service an in crease of about 12,000 miles is shown as against the previous year's esti mated increase of 6,000 miles. The total volume of business in the mon eyrorder division for the year is up ward of $143,000,000, and shows a net profit to the government of about $50,000. The volume of ordinary mail - matter has largely increased, and it is estimated that the revenue on the number of pieces handled dur ing the past year would have been, without reductions of postage, up ward of $70,000,000. The free de livery service was during the last fiscal year extended to 169 addition al places under the Act of January 3d, 1887, making a total of 358 free delivery cities. The number of car riers was increased from 5,310 to 6,346. Statistics are submitted con trasting the American service with that of Great Britain, Germany and France, demonstrating that in cheap ness of postage, gross revenue and expenditures, number of post-ollices. extent of mail routes, mileage of mail service and volume of mail mat ter transmitted, the postal system of the United States is the leading one of the world. 

WASHINGTON .LETTER. special correspondence of the monitor. Washington, Dec. 3d. The return of congressmen to Washington, which had been slow prior to Thanksgiving day, became a rush on Saturday, aud this morning it appears that the session will open with fifty more members present than had been expected. The travel stain ed crowd of noisy statesmen about the House post-office and committee rooms make the corridors ring since Friday. Explanations of "just how it was done,' referring to the recent election, are offered from all sides, and plans are laid for schemes good, bad and indifferent. The democrats, of course, concede the next House to the republicans by a bare majority, aud will take what advantage may be left in the short session of the fif- 1 Jcth eongress. The session opens with the speak ership fight fairly on. As yet, Mr. Cannon is the only directly avowed candidate, with Messrs. McKinley, ReeiJ, Burrows, and Butterworth in the background. Mr. McKinley's friends appear to prefer his appoint ment, if possible, to the chairman of the committee on ways and means, as it would increase his presidential chances. If Senator Sherman goes into tln cabinet, Mr. McKinley would naturally prefer the senatorship. Iu his way in the fight for the ways aud means committee would stand Judge Kelley, the "father of the House." How far the child would oppose its parent i- an open questiou. Many members think that the Judge is get ting rather too old for active work. Indeed the feeling is strong that the younger men will conduct the coming administration. Mr. Harri son's reticence as to his cabinet con tinues, but those who have talked to him pretend to have discovered an in tention to appoint young men. This impression is so strong that Senator Sewell writes to a friend here, "We old fellows must stand aside." Within the next two weeks the democrats in the House will probably move an investigation of election methods in Indiana and New York. If so, the republican senators will send a committee to overhaul south ern elections, and the mud-slinging will go on right merrily. Neither party would expect any direct results. General Dudley might be asked to tell what he knew about "votes in blocks of five," and Congressman Oates might be questioned as to "white supremacy" in Alabama, but that would be the end of it. A con gressional investigation of - elections is purely partisan and would be so recognized. Representative Ford will present his report of the immigration inves tigation early in the session. The nature of the remedies for pauper and criminal immigration and that for contract laborers, have not been com pletly 'outlined. Mr. Ford's failure for re-election will lead him to report the bill as soon as possible, so that it may not fail to become a law be fore his retirement. With the opening of congress, the president returns from the cottage at Oak View to the executive mansion, to what Mr. Blaine once feelingly j spoke of as "the homelessness and hopelessness of the mansion of pow er." Mr. Blaine's anxiety to occupy this dread mansion need not be men tioned here. President Cleveland finds the White House unusually ele gant in new paint and revamped fur- j niture, ready for his- successor. Even the French chief feels anxiety only about the inaugural luncheon, and enters into eager conversation with anybody who can tell him aught of "Meester Harrison." During the vacation, the old raf ters under the corridors near the pres ident's office have been replaced with iron girderB. The weight of the great crowds present on reception nights had strained the rafters somewhat during the last half century. The story published last week to the effect that the president and Mrs. Cleveland will go abroad next June is official ly denied, but the president is silent as to his real plans. In the meantime the newspapers are making plans for him. There is a rumor that Miss Rose Elizabeth Cleveland will be at the White House during the coming season. She was here during the opening season of the present ad ministration, and may see its lose. As a hostess she was by no means equal to Mrs. Cleveland. A certain lack of tact, want of adaptability and a mistaken literary ambition, perhaps, marred her well-meant efforts. Secretary Whitney takes occasion in his annual report to the president to make an elaborate review of the progress of the navy since March 4 th, 1885. He says, in brief, that while at that date the United States had no vessel that could compare with those of other nations, the government now has, if not first-class vessels, at least a prospect of having them. He be lieves that a great triumph has been effected in securing at Bethlehem, Pa., the building of a plant capable of turning out armor and gun steel equal to the highest grades of European manufacture. The success of the republican par ty at the polls has stimulated the faithful iu the District of Columbia. The National Republican, for some time suffering a partial eclipse, being only permitted to appear as a weekly, will be rejuvinated as a daily. The capital has been fully subscribed, witli E. W. Fox as editor. Whether or not the paper will be successful, re mains to be seen. If it does succeed its triumph will be entirely due to re publican government employes. The geographical position of Washington makes the city democratic, and so far as advertising and suburban cir culation go, a republican daily will always have a poor field to plow. The bill to place a bust of Chief Justice Waite in the row of marble busts of deceased Chief Justices in the Supreme Court room passed the senate but was hung up in the House. An appropriation of $5000 was al lowed by the last congress for an oil portrait of Mr. Waite to be hung up in the robing room. It is vaguely hoped that the artist will be more successful than the majority of those who have painted portraits for the government. Tiik Votk ok Indiana. The oflici- j al canvass of the Presidential vote of 1 Indiana has been completed. The ! I total vote for the highest elector on each of the four tickets is 536,61!), as follows: Highest, Republican elector, 263,361. Highest, Demo cratic, 261,013 ; Prohibition, 91 Labor, 2691. Republican plurality, 2318. General Hovey's plurality for Governor was 2200. The total vote for Governor was only 139 less than for President. The plurality of the lowest Republican elector over the lowest Democratic elector is 2131. The electors on each ticket do not vary over 10 votes in their totals. Tin: Maink Votk. The complete official vote of the State for Presi dential Electors as tabulated by the returning board gives Harrison 73, 731, Cleveland 50, 12, Fisk 2690, Streeter 1345. Harrison's plurality is 23,252. Burleigh, Republican candidate for Governor, had a plu rality of 18,056 in last September's election. Tiik Votk of Wisconsin. The official canvass of the State shows that the total vote for President is 35 1,66 I, an increase of 31,776 over the vote of 1881. Harrison's plu rality is 21,271 ; Blaine's plurality in 1884 was 14,90, a gain for Harrison of 6591.

Total vote of State, 61,918; Harrison's plurality, 6769. Votk of Illinois. The following is the official vote of the State of Illinois, as shown by the complete returns now in the office of the Sec retary : For President Harrison, 370,473 ; Cleveland, 348,272; Fisk, 21,095 ; Streeter, 7090. Harrison's plurality, 22,201. Mr. Earle has sold his Landmark to Mr. Jameson, the foreman of the office and retires upon his laurels and his capital, which we hope is abundant to keep the wolf from his door to the end. His good-bye to enemies and friends is a rich but characteristic piece of writing. He has not been a bad neighbor by any means, and as there never will be another like him may he live and take his ease to a good old age, and may his children rise up to bless him. Vermont Standard.
