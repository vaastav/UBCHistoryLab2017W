Arizona Sentinel. WEDNESDAY, DE 'EMBER 6, 1905. JOINT STATEHOOD. President in His Message Recom commends Admission of Ari zona and New Mexico y as One State. "Washington, D. C. Dec. 5. In his message to congress today President Roosevelt makes the following state hood recommendation: ''I recommend that Indian territory and Oklahoma be admitted as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be ntmitted as one state. There is no obligation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters of con venience only, as binding us on the question of admission to statehood. "Nothing has taken up more time in the congress during the past few years than the question of the state hood to be granted to the four terri tories above mentioned, and after care ful consideration of all that has been developed in the discussion of the question. I recommend that they be immediately admitted as two states There is no justification for further delay; and the advisability of making the four territories into two states has been clearly established. "In some of the territories the legis lative assemblies issue licenses for gambling. The congress should by laws forbid this practice, the harm ful results of- which are obvious at a glance. . News dispatches from Wash ington are to the effect that a number of Americans were in troduced were induced to settle in the Isle of Pines because of official statements from the War Department, that it was United States territory, that when poli cy made it expedient to cede the Island to Cuba the War Depart ment, suppressed the official publications that had led a num ber of home seekers to the little Island, their complaints are now before the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate and those in a 'position to .know intimate that Congressional dis cussion of the matter will devel op facts as surprising to the pub lic as-interesting to those .con cerned in the settlement of the -question. Ex-Ambassador Choate made a- political speech in New York, the language of which indicates that while in England, he must have drank deep from the fount of impure and defiled Billings gate. He said the political boss "was "a creature without scruple or conscience, who fills his capa cious maw with graft and who feeds, his greedy followers upon' political garbage gathered from the official flesh pots and swill pails." Vice PresidenPairbanks has taken a larger house in Wash ington for the winter and is pre paring to startle the social world by the variety, number and magnificence of his entertain ments during the season. It may be significant of the state of his desires that his new house is several blocks nearerand right on the road to the White House. Mrs. Hettie Green has just cel ebrated her seventieth birthday but according to all reports is as fit as a two year old. Looking at Hetty, Russell Sage and Rock efeller why hasn't some of these longevity students thonght to recommend accumulation of vast fortunes as a means for pro longing life? Melba, the Grand Opera Sing er appeared at a musical in New York a few nights ago 4ind was paid 1,000 for a single song. Is this the explanation of some "pf those bargains that we have got for a song? Mr. Henry M. Whitney's snub at the polls in Massachusetts was followed by something tscarcely gentler than a kick at the White House. This is Mr. Whitney's unlucky month. The engineers who recom mehcTa sea level say that they want to build for eternity but the people don't want them to be at it forever. It must be humiliating to Jack London to know that more peo ple can tell how many times he has been married than can tell the titles of his books. The early settlers of today are those who pay promptly at the first of each, month. 

DANGER SIGNALS. No engineer would be mad enough to run by the llag which signaled danger. It is different with the average man or woman, nicy attempt constantly to run by Wv dan ger signals of Katurc and that attempt costs thousands of lives every year. When the appetite becomes irregu lar or entirely gives out when sleep is troubled and broken, when there is a constant feeling of dull ness and languor, Nature is hoisting the danger sig nal. The stomach and its allied organs are failing in their work and the body is losing the nutrition on "which its strength de pends. bucn a condition calls for a prompt use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It cures dis eases of the stomach and other organs of digestion and nutrition, purifies and enriches the blood and builds up the body with sound, solid flesh. " I have had so much bene fit from your medicines am clad to say a few words that you may use for publication," writes Mrs. J. R. Downey Crystal Lake. Conn. "Had been troubled with a complication of diseases for oer two years, but kidneys and liver botherc'l me most. Some of my worst ailments were headache, frequent pahis around heart and under richt shoulder blade. My hands and feet were cold nearly all the time, and I had such chilliness be tween shouldors. Some days cared but little for food: I lo..t flesh; felt so tired and mis erable it seemed I couldn't do any house work. Took medicine from my physician, but received no benefit. Bought a bottle of 'Golden Medical Discovery.' and after tak ln? it I felt so much better wo determined to give it a fair trial. Appetite soon Improved and gradually the disorders disappeared un til now I am well." A Great Doctor Book Free Send 21 one cent stamps to Dr. R. V. Pierce, Buffalo, N.

STREET CLEANING CAMPAIGN. The Yuma Woman's Club Heard From. The City Fathers Invoked. A special committee composed of Mesdames Pughy Baker and Robertson, representing the civic department of the Yuma Woman's Club, appeared before the Town Council at its regular monthly meeting last Monday night, and asked for a hearing, which was graciously and courteously accorded by his honor, "Mayor Shanssey, and the aldermanic body. Mrs. Pugh as chairman and spokes man of the committee states the -object of the civic department of the club to be for the present civic improvement along the lines of street cleaning, yard cleaning, and trash removing not as a spasmodic effort to clean up the town, but as a regular and. persistent and or ganized campaign for civic cleanliness. A general plan of procedure was out lined and suggested, and the council was asked to co-operate with the Woman's Club in making the move ment popular and successful. Some of the councilmen, on the ap pearance of the club women ' on the scene, looked as if tiiey didn't know exactly what the ladies had up their sleeves to hand out to them, and looked immensely relieved when they were asked not for an appropriation, nor for any sweeping reform measures, but only to have the visible and mov able dirt cleared out and kept out. A committee of four from the council composed of city attorney F.. L. In- graham, councilman L. C. Stahl H. H. Donkersley, P. Munson was appointed to meet the civic committee of the Woman's Club to draft ordinances covering the wishes of the ladies, and the pressing needs of the town. As the slogan of the civic department of the Woman's Club, this year is "clean up, clean out, keep clean. Make Yuma beautiful," it is expected that some thing will be doing ere long for the civic betterment of the town. This is a move in the right direction. Nothing could be more opportune. The town ought to be cleaned up thoroughly no half way. measures about it and the chances are that it will be done. Let everybody help, by word and work. Let there be no , laggards nor obstructionists. It will cost consider able work and some money; but iwhat is a little money to a town that can support a merry-go-round for a solid month at $200 per night? The Square Hile Homestead Scheme. Congressman Brook's scheme to rob the government of its land by increasing the home stead bill to 640 acres is a grab pure and simple in the interest of the rich land owners of the west, and the bill should be killed so dead that neither it nor Brooks will ever be heard of a gain. Any congressman -who has no better sense than to cre ate a law by which the public domain is to be sold in quanti ties four times greater than now should be deported from the state in disgrace for such work. Tne land law should be cut down to 80 acres instead of 160 as at present. The day is not far dis tant when 80 acres, or even 40 acres, will be considered a big farm by the great masses of the American people. Opinion, Pu eblo, Colo, Oct. 14. The way to be an optimist is to make yourself believe that you like to get up in the morn ing. When a woman acts as if she weren't jealous it is a sign that everybody knows she .is trying to fool them. We have received the Pocket Diary " and Memorandum Book for 1905 of C. A.

Harper's Bazaar says, "The woman who goes into a matri monial partnership without knowing thoroughly the trade of housekeeping is a fraud and a false pretender just as her hus band would be if he did not know his trade or business or profes sion well enough to finance the new household." All-men join in this sentiment though they deplore the fact that practical women lack chic and style. Enjoy life as it comes to you. Listen to the bird songs and the voices of the children. Linger to see the sunset or the opening of a flower. Take into your life the goodness, the pleasure and brightness of every day, for "we shall pass this way but once." And then when you reach the last day tha is given you here, you will be content and can say, "I have lived." Town and Country. The pastor of Mr. Eockefel ler's church has said that he would not take all of Mr. Rock efeller's money twice over for the little trunk he brought from home when he started to school. No doubt he and Mr. Rockefel ler, between them will be able to agree not to trade. A protest against seating Sen ator Smoot of Utah and signed by a million women will be pre sented to the Senate by a Sena tor from each state at the open ing of Congress. In all of Smoot's troubles there is no dif ficulty in finding the women in the case. A will written by a former judge of the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania' has been declared void because of non-compliance with certain legal requirementf. It will be remembered that Sam uel J. Tilden's will was defective for the same reason. Consular officers are to be chosen hereafter by merit, but what is to become of the polit ical hack who could always be banished to some reinata consu lar station when his retirement for his countrys good becomes urgent. A letter from Edward Seventh, then Prince of wales to Mrs. Langtry brought only twenty five dollars at auction, but the advertising paid Mrs. Langtry for the loss of the letter and she doubtless has others that will bring more. There is a general impression that the Chinese do not under stand a joke, -and the Chinese deputation that jusf arrived in Philadelphia for the purpose of studying good government, cer tainly has the joke on itself. as the old method but children are more' frequently spanked as a relief for their parent's feel ings than for the good of the children, and the soulless elec trical machine makes no provis ion for this.

ANGELES - EXAMINER AT SHOREY'S SOUTHWESTERN NEWS CO. THE TEXAN RANGER. First Fight With Indians In Which Revolvers Were Used. John Coffee Hays was. reared on a farm in Wilson r county, Tenn., being born therein 4817. At the age of eightean he migra ted to Texas, where, during the struggle of that Mexican pro vince for independence, he serv ed with distinction in the mili tary campaign, conducted by General .Sam Houston, being no ted forlijfc1tavery and strategy. Aft'HRefmination of that confiictRyJes was placed in com mand of the small regular force that was shortly afterward or ganized and became known to fame as the Texan rangers. Many were the desperate fights in which he was engaged with the fierce Comanches and border Indians', and innumerable . were the perils which he encountered. He was the first to supply an armed force with Colt's revolv ers for use in battle. The Indians mode of warfare in those early days was to draw their, enemy's fire and then sweep down npon. them like a whirl wind, plying.their bows and us ing their spears with deadly effect. So cautious were they in tnis respect tnat tney soon distinguished the double bar reled guniwhen it was "brought into use andi only approached when they-were sure that such weapons had been emtied. On the first, occasion when Hays and his rangers, armed with re volvers, met a band on the war path they allowed their fire to be liberally drawn, and then the Indians charged with exultant cries, but when the revolver was brought into play at close quar ters the panic that insued was absolute and the destruction of the Indians complete. Hays was colonel of the First Texan regiment, the nucleus 'of which was formed of veteran rangers. . For Rent. Dwelling "house. Inquire at Sentinel office. "Friend Theodore." Ten senators called on. the president the other day to talk earnestly about a matter of no less importance than an office. They approached the. subject with great seriousness and were very much, surprised to fiub Mr. Roosevelt unable io concentrate his thoughts on anyihing but Bill Sewall, his old Main guide. After various unsuccessful at tempts to interest the president in the weighty matter of the office, one of the senators said, "Mr. President, ytf' seem very. much interested m this . , UlQe. "Yes, senator, I am. Bill is an interesting man and a real friend. He is the only man in the United States who in writing to the president about an office or anything else addresses him as 'Friend Theodore.'" The railroads say if they stop rebates they will bring on a rate war. They also confess that it is true that they publish one tar iff and collect another. Theo dore Roosevelt said at New Or leans "There is one thing as President of this country, I won't do, and that is to make a bluff that I cannot make good." The issue appears to be joined.
