SCHOOL FUND CUTS SC0RED8YTIGERT Commissioner Depicts Results of Ruthless Paring of the Budgets. PLEA MADE FOR TEACHERS Municipal, County and State Authorities Blamed for Lack of Education Bequisites. Federal Commissioner of Education John J. Tigert, in his final Education week statement today, took a parting shot at those authorities responsible for the ruthless cutting of public school budgets and depicted the results as follows: "We are housing thousands of young children in buildings in which we would not house race horses or our hogs or our cattle. , "We are paying many teachers ot our children salaries far below what we pay day laborers. "We are failing to provide play grounds and thus leaving our children to the education of the city streets." With this, the concluding day ot Education week. designated as "physical education day," Commissioner Tigert took the occasion to deplore the lack of adequate physical training in the schools of the nation. Small Per Cent Benefited. "Only 10 per cent of all the children of school age in the country," he said, "are receiving anything which even pretends to be adequate physical education and health training. Only twelve states have state supervisors of physical education; only CO per cent of the rural districts l?ave any form of health inspection. "And yet." he emphasized, "during the past two years municipal, county and state authorities have ruthlessly out from school budgets requests for funds for physical education, for sites for playgrounds and for super\ ision of play activities. "The United States is rapidly forgetting the lesson taught by the war an to the deplorable physical condition of a largo per cent of the youth ?>f this country. For a year or so after we were shocked by the realization that more than one-third of the men examined in the draft had to be rejected as physically unfit the nation seemed to he aroused to the necessity ?>f providing adequate physical education for the children of the country. Fiut we are now rapidly relaxing into our previous laissez-faire attitude. ?fd of I*hymical Training. "It is needless to argue the need of physical education for our children. We all know how imperative that need is. What we do need to have burned into our consciousness is that the nation which refuses to remember the lesson just learned in regard to the physical condition of its people will ultimately pay a terrible price for its neglect. "On this, the last day of Education week. T wish to emphasize with a'l the earnestness and force of which I am <-:<nahl? tKof -.Ano ..f !>? and advances either in phyisal education or in any of the other phases of public school education, which educators all over the country have been so eloquently setting forth this week, can be brought about without funds, and also that at present we. the richest nation !n the world, are failing lamentably in providing adequate funds for the education oi our children. Children Inadequately Housqd. "We arc housing thousands of young children in buildings in which we would rot house our race horses, or our hogs or our cattle. We are paying many leachers of our children salaries far below what we pay day laborers. We are failing to provide playgrounds and are thus leaving our children to the education of the city streets. These statements are all literally true. "It is unbelievable that the American people will fail to carry forward successfully the great experiment in democratic education started by our forefathers. But the time has come for action. It is to be hoped thai every voter lit every city and every county of the country, when next he is called upon to vote for school bonds, will remember i he facts brought out during the past j week and vote accordingly."' special notices.

Yesterday the bureau of advice and Information of the Tuberculosis Association, which ^V\/WVfUVf receives many 2ew"W%JwvwvV arising? affecting: the care of children suffering: from tuberculosis in its incipient stage. This problem, briefly stated, was what to do with a fourteen-yearold boy who needs hospital care and whose parents cannot afford to send him fo a private sanatorium, where the expense would be from $18 to $25 a week. Unfortunately the District of Columbia has no proper place for such a patient. If he is sent to the Tuberculosis Hospital, he must mingle with adult patients, and be placed in an open ward with such patients. Usually such a child has the child's instincts of restless activity. It is difficult for him to fit into the regime of the hospital, which is designed for older patients, most of whom are in a much more chronic condition. The only relief by way of diversion that the hospital has to offer is through the occupational therapy classes, organized and carried on by the Tuberculosis Association, until such time as Cfiri orocc (a nrAnarod t r\ tntilrA an art propriation to take over this work.*^ With Adult Patients. Even in these classes the boy would have to mingle with adult patients, and the program for his care and treatment, if planned along the lines of model children's sanatoria, would call for an entirely different procedure from that which the hospital for adult patients Is able to provide. This Is but a single example of the failure of the District of Columbia to make proper provision for its tuberculous children. This need should be frankly faced and some solution should be found. Children twelve and under are received from time to time at the Children's Hospital, but this admirable institution cannot specialize in this class of sufferers In the same way that a sanatorium especially designed for tuberculous children would do. A recent authority on the treatment of this group has laid down these principles of action for children exposed to tuberculosis In their own homes or actually suffering from the trouble: (1) Contact cases with passable home conditions may be taken care of in the Open Air School. (2) Contact cases who are not ill in improper homes are proper subjects for a preventorium. (3) Children who actually have tuberculous disease should go to a special sanatorium. (4) It is often impossible to decide where a given child belongs In this classification, and if he is ill with an ailment unidentified he should go to a children's hospital. Preventive Work Inadequate. It is the belief of many health workers, who have studied the problem of the child exposed to tuberculosis, that not until Washington is better equipped to care for these four classes of children In the way Indicated can the District of Columbia be said to be doing adequate preventive work for those groups from which most of the sufferers from tuberculosis in adult life are recruited. T" ?nnn on nnhlin nnininn tn thft seriousness of the situation and the Inadequacy of the present situation to meet it is one of the aims of the local Tuberculosis Association, which is today carrying on its Christmas seal sale for the general support of its work. Something over 800,000 of these Christmas health tokens have already been sold and paid for since the campaign opened. The goal is 3,000,000 seals sold in the District of Columbia.

PROGRAM BACKED i Original Plan of Education Board Approved by Special Committee. FIRST MEETING IS HELD Five Named by Dr. Simon Launch Work to Better Educational Conditions. I The orilrinal school building pro- J grain of the board of education contained in the budget for the next fiscal year was approved today by the committee of five appointed by Dr. Abram Simon, president of the , school board, to formulate and direct a concerted campaign for the better ment of educational conditions in the District. in a resoiunon aaopieu ai. us mat meeting today in the office of Henry H. Glassie, its chairman, the committee declared that "we stand for the program of the board of education entire and complete, as a minimum program, undiminished both with respect to buildings, salaries and every other item. Purpose to Boost. Chairman Glassie in opening the meeting said that it is not the purpose of the committee to originate anything, but to marshal the necessities in support of the board of education and to find ways of bringing Washington's necessities effectively to the attention of both houses of Congress. j "In beginning this work." said Mr. Glassie, "we are much heartened by the public statement made by that 1 strong friend of the public school, j Senator Capper, and by those stancn 1 friends of the District, Representatives Zihlman of Maryland and 1 Moore of Virginia, and other public i men who know the exact situation, j They realize that we are not asking . the impossible. This is of necessity 4 a period of economy and retrench- J ment, but economy does not mean cutting down every kind of expendi- ? ture. * When a man finds his income diminishing, he does not cut down the J children's food supply; he does not \ economize on milk and eggs. On the contrary, he marshals his expendi- * tures, in the order of their impor- { tance, and cuts down those which are of the least significance. He begins > his economies with the luxury and 8 display items of expenditure. Yet, in 1 this period of economy, there are peo- 1 TVoohln??nn At> * I > ? nAn, 1 |J1C 111 ??

Stressing: the imperative need to the hospital of a laboratory building, the annual report of Freedmen's Hospital. made public today, also urges I an increase in the force of employes. J The long hours of daily work which i a number of employes now perform. ; the report says, are regarded as aj most wrious obstacle to maintaining j the desired standard of service. Regrading the proposed laboratory building, the report says: "Greater importance cannot be attached to any part of the hospital organization than a laboratory wherein accurate and scientific work can be done to support the clinical service of the institution. The report says 560,000 wili be required for the building. The total number of patients received during the year was 3.554. Of these. 8*35 were pay patients; 1.214. including 123 births, were United States indigents, and 1,445. including 131 births, were District of Columbia indigents. There were discharged from the hospital during the fiscal year 3,479 patients. There were 1,797 surgical operations performed, and 341 births at the hospital during the year. Receipts from pay patients amounted to $22,486, against $24,219.25 for the preceding year. There were 885 pay patients from twenty-four states, including two foreign countries*, divided as follows: "C.1 milo noc f-moU I male white. 1 female white. The indigent patients were engaged in 75 different occupations and the pay patinets 56 different occupations. There were 1.788 administrations of anesthetics, as against 1.781 last year. There were 1.017 radiographs; made. 91 X-ray treatments given and 3,920 laboratory examinations made. landIfIpInts jump 5,000 in year Annual Report Shows Entries Allowed 2,787,011 Acres More Than Previous Year. Increased business in the general land office was noted today by the jommissioner in his annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1922. \pproxlmately 5,000 more patents ivere Issued during 1922 than In 1921, nvolving an Increase of 2,787.011 icres, the commissioner said, notwlthitanding "the handicap of the heavy irrearage that the commissioner Intented from the last administration." During the fiscal year entries were illowed for 10,367,153 acres, of which 1.070,175 acres were taken under the stock-raising homestead act. The irea patented during the year totaled 12,904.821 acres, a substantial Increase >ver the area patented the year previ>us. Total cash receipts for the fiscal . ear were $8,813,659.16, the commissioner reported. The sum of $199,059 vas collected and turned into the Jnited States Treasury, and $179,114 ecovered through civil and criminal ictions in cases of depredations on the public lands, through the activities >f the field service. Substantial progress was noted in the matter of reclamation of desert lands. Desert land entries received luring the year totaled 1.671 and 1.659 patents- were issued under the law. Power applications involving 674.000 acres were received under the federal water power act. During the year 416.435 acres of public lands were withdrawn or placed In a state of reservation, and 6.236,611 acres heretofore withdrawn or reserved were re- j stored to entry or other proper disposition. The net increase In national imcoi aivib, in- ^uiiiinigDiuiicr reported since the beginning of the fiscal year as 13,866 acres. Patents for mineral lands were issued on 574 applications, involving an area of 63,343 acres. The commissioner calls attention in the report to the rapidly diminishing public domain, calling, he says, for a careful scrutiny of all proposed legislation looking toward final disposition of any considerable acreage. He suggests that with the public land laws as they now stand, it is apparent that our remaining stock of public land will not continue to supply the demand for any considerable time.

Reservations, When Constructive Outlays End, Expected to Pay Own Upkeep Thereafter. Declaring that "the national parks are perhaps the moat popular institutions fostered and developed by the national government today, the annual reiiort of the director of the national park service, made public today. points out that 1.216.490 persons visited the parks during the past year, an increase of 44,493 persons over the record travel of the previous year. Sixty per cent of the visitors to the parks during the past year came in their owa automobiles and more than two-thirds of these availed themselves of the opportunities to camp out, the report added. This year's total of visitors shows an increase of 881,691 more than were recorded in the parks in 1915. tne report says, adding: that "it is obvious that the parks are amonp the most popular institutions fostered by the government. Progress was reported on the national park to park highway, which touches in a great circle the major national parks of the west, and is declared to be one of the most im- | portant highways from the park standpoint. About one-fourth of the 1 6.000-mile objective has been completed. the report says, and it is hoped that the various states through which the remaining unimproved sections pass will include them in their plans |->r early improvement under co- | operative arrangements for federal aid. Cost SI.000*255. Administration and protection ofj the parks cost about $700,000 for 1922. the report said, revenues amounting to $432,964.84. while the appropriation was $1,446,520, leaving a net cost of $1,000,255.11. Approximately $300,000 was spent for continuation of new road projects. The report points out that after construction of proper roads, the layout of additional necessary trails and the erection of proper administrative j buildings and other structures the, parks should be on a self-supporting basis. "In contemplating the cost' of the national park system to the j federal government." it adds, "it should be remembered that the parks ! und monuments in attracting a travel of 1.200.000 visitors keep at home and distribute among the states travel money mounting into the tens of millions of dollars." Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado ranked first in the number of visitors during 1922, with 219,164 guests of the park: Yosemite National Park in California ranked third in number of visitors- behind the Hot Springs Park in Arkansas. Available for Winter Sport. The charm of the national parks, the report points out. lies not alone in their summer grandeur. Unex-, celled opportunities are offered for winter vacationing and for winter sports in the parks. Yosemite valley is accessible in winter and accommodations are available for visitors. Rocky Mountain. Mount Rain- ! ter ana Larayette National parks are also available for winter sports, while Grand Canyon. Hot Springs and Hawaii are the present all-year parks. An interesting development In the Hawaiian National Park is the reappearance of the lake of living lava in the Kilauea crater, which drained away through subterranean vents in May. 1921. 

SHIPSTEAD LEADS FIGHT AGAINST PIERCE BUTLER Senator-Elect Opens Attack on Supreme Court Candidate Before Committee. Efforts to defeat the confirmation of Pierce Butler. St. Paul attorney, nominated to be associate justice of j the Supreme Court of the United | States, were begun before a Senate judiciary subcommittee yesterday by Senator-elect Shipstead, farmer-laborite, of Minnesota. The hearing was behind closed doors. Further hearings on the nomination will be held next Wednesday, the recess being taken at the request of Mr. Shipstead for time to present witnesses to support his rtiarges. While Mr. Shipstead or members of the committee would not discuss the former's testimony, it was learned that he submitted a detailed statement. with four major counts, attacking Mr. Butler. 'The principal one was understood to relate to the traction fight of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company, of which Mr. Butler is counsel, and certain phases of financing in connection with It. In this connection Mr. Shipstead was said to have asked that the committee summon Dr. Delos F. Wilcox. a New York expert, who filed a report in the traction fight. Other witnesses said to have been given in a list to the committee included Prof. Schaper and Max Lowenthal of New York; Prof. Felix Frankfurter of the-Harvard Law School, a son-in-law of Justice Brandeis of the Supreme Court: Prof. Stanley Rypins of Minneapolis and Prof. Gerhard Dietrichson of the University of Illinois.

CIVIL SERVICE * RATINGS ASSAILED 41 Reform League Speaker Hits Proposed Substitute for Sterling Bill Plan. MPS CONGRESS GROUP Irs. Edith Roosevelt. Widow of Ex-President, and Others Elected to Council's Membership. The system of ratings devised by he bureau of efficiency as a substiute for the reclassification of the ivil service as provided for in the iterling-Lelilbach bill was denounced iy Robert Catherwood at the con luding session of the forty-second nnual meeting of the National CiviT iervice Reform League at the Hotel Vashington today. "The National Civil Service Reform *eague is emphatically in favor of he Sterling-Lehlbaeh bill, and wants o see it enacted into law," declared Jr. Catherwood, who is a member of he league's legislative committee. f r r- ' ? v-vmsreos, in iair ana open judgment. concludes that there is to be o reclassification, then we will have ost in a fair fight." 'Reads Smoot's Letter. Mr. Catherwood read to the delerates a letter, which he said had been ent'December 6 by Senator Smoot to members of President Harding's cabnet. in which information was a6ked rhich would assist the Senate approbations subcommittee, of which Sentor Smoot is chairman, in determiuugT whether the classification system ri process of installation by the bueau of efficiency could "be made t?? erve as a permanent basis for ?alrv standardization in the departmental service. Mr. Catherwood, a former presilent of the Cook county. III., civil ervice commission, characterized the. ureau of efficiency plan as providng for little more than "a mere ollection of opinions of supervising officials." "Why not call up the bureau chiefs nd ask whom they want promoted nd whom they want fired and be done rith it?" Mr. Catherwood said. KfRefency Bureau Assailed. "It is time to say quite frankly." Ir. Catherwood continued, "that the >ureau of efficiency seems to be used ?y a very limited group in each house f Congress as the snuffer-out of all unda of progress in the civil servce administration. The bureau since ts creation some years ago as a eparate agency has pursued a course f sniping, first at the reclassifies* ion commission set up by Congress .nd later at the legislation which cas proposed as a result of thai ommission's work." The election to membership of Mrs Idith K. Roosevelt, widow of Theolore Roosevelt, who was United Hates civil service commissioner beore he became President, to the* ouncil of the National Civil Service ieform League was announced today frs. Roosevelt has been consulted nd has agreed to serve on th?eague's council. Other new members elected to th* ouneil of the league were: Miss Ha* ean James of this city, president ?_ he American Civic Association ar.il he American Association of L'niver. itv Women: Mrs. G.

Conn., was re-elected chairmai)f the council of the league. Savings of $700,000,0^0 annualC night be made by abolishing useless >laces in the civil service and dis harging incompetent employes an* >utting into effect other methods, a ording to resolutions adopted at th Inal session. The measures suggested also includeclassification of the civil service ubstantially along the lines of the iterling-Lehlbaoii bill, adoption o ivil service laws in the thirty-eighi tates that have none, and introdu? ion of modern employment methocs n the public service. "Three billions of dollars are ar.ually expended on the pay rolls of ur rational, state and local governnents,'* the resolutions stated. "A arge proportion, carefully estimated t one-quarter of this vast sum. car. e saved by the application of the?' neasures."
