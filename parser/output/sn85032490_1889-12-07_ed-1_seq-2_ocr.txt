A Long Declaration of Principles Enunci ated by the Fanners' Alliance. St. Lopis, Mo., Dec 0. The National Farmers' alliance has adopted a long series of resolutions favoring woman's suffrage, favoring the reservation of public lands for actual settlers and against the acquisi tion of lands in the states and territories by aliens; for the rigid enforcement of the Jaw against railroad corporations that were not complying with their contracts as to the disposition of lands; calling for tlie free coinage of gold and silver and an amendment to the law which permitted loans to banks on bonded security of money at 1 per cent while the farmer was obliged to pay 8 and 10 per cent; favoring the payment of the public debt as rapidly as possible, opposing bonds as the basis for loans and reiterating the argument ncainst the national banking Bystem and in favor of the greenback doctrine. Taxes on real estate mortgages aud a graded in come tax were demanded. Economy in the management of all departments of the government was called for, aud a special declaration was launched against any proposition looking to the increase of gov ernment employes' salaries. The liquor traffic was opposed in all its forms. The Hennepin canal project was endorsed, as was also that of a deep harbor on the gulf coast. Another resolution was passed rec ommending congress to take some action to compel the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads to pay their debts and objecting to any further extension of time. The Australian .system of voting was enthusiastically endorsed. Thu resolution on the tariff was as fol lows: "Resolved, That we favor such revision and reduction of the tariff that the taxes may rest as lightly as possible upon pro ductive labor, and that its burdens may bo imposed upon the luxuries and removed from the necessities of life, and in a man ner which will prevent continued accumu lation of thu "United States treasury sur plus." The foregoing resolutions were then capped by one declaring that the mem bers of the convention would support no candidate who did not subscribe to the principles enumerated therein.

Then it was agreed that the farmers should appoint a legislative committee of two to act in conjunction with the legislative committee of the knights at Washington to secure work in accordance with the views of both bodies. A common platform was agreed upon upon land, money and transportation re lorm and an understandimr arrived at by which each organization will actively as bist the other in every way po-sible. Tho executive olficers of the two organizations will form a central council to consult from tune to time upon all matters of joint in terest. AS GOOD 0E BETTER The Large Volume of Money Actively Employed Trade About tho Same. New York, Dec 5. R. G. Dun fc Co.'s Weekly Review of Tra3o says: No dis turbance seems to have appeared or re buked from the Lynn and Boston fires as yet, and the fiee offering of bouds to tho treasury makes the monetary prospect clearer. In all other respects the events of the past week have but added to tue prevailing confidence in the future of business, aud the operating of congrcs with the annual message and reports have had drcidedlyian encouragiug influence. The volume of money m circulation out side the treasury now, 1,417,00,000, is about 11,000,000 larger thHn a year ngo, but far more activel- em ployed. In tho interior. however, there are some signs of abating demand and money is plenty at Chicago with rates unchanged, comparatively easy at St. Paul, in good supply at New Orleaus, fairly active at Milwaukee, the demand be ing moderate at 7 per cent; in good de mand at 7 and S at Detroit and 5 to 7 at Pittsburg; in brisk demand at Boston; Btill tight at Philadelphia with u per cent stiff. The treasuiy has taken in during week $1,300,010 more than it has disbursed. Reports of business indicate some falliug off at the west. The same difficulty affect the clothing trade at Cleveland and is the cause of depression in the coal trade, but nearly all reports indicate that busi ness is satisfactory. Pittsburg notes im proved demand and hicher prices in iron and in flint glass, window being un changed. Tho situation in the great industries is especially significant. In spite of the un- Srecedeuted supply of iron there seems to e actual scarcity at Philadelohia and some sales of No. 1 at $19 for'l&h) delivery are quoted here. Buyers hesitate aud sales are not large, but there b a strong under tone, and at Pittsburg an adqauce of 23 cents to 1 per ton. Bar iron i more ir regular, and while rails are stiffly quoted at $35. No sales appear, but an offer is re ported by an eastern mill at $34. Dealers in wooi are also more confident, and at Boston improved prices were real ized for combing and delain. The boot and shoe manufacture contin ues remarkably prosperous. Another large branch of industry which has been doing exceptionally well is the building traae, and well sustained markets for all materials, especially for lumber and glass. The speculative market have been strong. The general tendencies of prices are still upward, the rise since November 30 having averagea four-tenths of 1 per cent for all commodities. In the stock market there was serious depression at the end of last week and on Mouday, but since that time there has been some recovery with considerable for eign buying. At the lowest, prices were nearly S2 per share below those of Novem ber 27, but about half of the loss has been recovered and the average is still nearly ?o per share higher than a year ago. The earnings of the railroads continue remark able large for November, exceeding those of last year by nearly 13 per cent. Much of the past week's depression was due to fears regarding the withdrawal of government deposits from banks, but it is now plain that no disturbance can result from the gradual measures adopted. The business failures number 316 as compared with a total of 249 last week. For the corresponding week of last year the figures were 305. RESULTED IN A DRAW. Boston, Mass., Dec. 6V-The lifteen-round glove fight for a purse of 1,000, winner to take all, between Mike Daly, of Bangor, and Jack McAuliffe, of Now York, light weights, at the rooms of the Cribb club last night resulted in a- draw. McAuliffe was the heavier, weighing 144 to Daly's 139 pounds. Con McAuliffe and Bob Drew seconded the New Yorker, while Bill Daly and Danny Gill seconded Daly. The fight was announced to begin at 8:30, but there was n long wrangle over the articles of agreement and it was after 11 o'clock when the men entered the ring. From the first McAuliffe landed his blows when and where he pleased, .nd Daly acted on the defensive most of the time. In the second round Daly got in a ter rific righthander on McAuliffe's wind that nearly took him off his feet, but McAuliffe replied with a blow that split Daly's left ear. In the third rouud McAuliffe worked Daly into his own corner and dealt him hot ones, firt with his left then with his right, landing on his iaw. In the fourth aud litth rounds Daly was caught off his guard and received severe blows on the jaw. In the sixth McAuliffe feinted with his right, then, swinging suddenly put iu his left with terrific force on Daly's chin, nearly lifting him off his feet. In the seventh there was some close in fighting, but mostly to McAuliffe's ad vantage. In the eighth, Daly got in his second telling blow, landing on McAuliffe's hose, but drawing no blood. In the ninth, McAuliffe caught Daly on the jaw with his right, staggering him, but Daly recovered and got in a swinging cut on McAuliffe's mouth that swelled his upper lip. In the next four rounds McAuliffe did all tho leading, and Daly's blows were wild. McAuliffe countered all his blows and showered blow upon blow upon him, in several instances nearly knocking him over the ropes. In the fourteenth and fifteenth rounds Daly appeared somewhat groggy, but kept gamely at work, and, when time was culled, the referee declared the battle a draw.

Yesterday af ternoon, James Mutne went to the office of the prosecuting attorney to discover whether a warrant had been issued for his arrest on the charge of attempting to dis pose of mortgaged property. The conver sation that followed disclosed a bold at tempt on tho part of two police officers and the father of tho defendant in a law suit to defeat justice; Mutrio is the prin cipal witness in the case of the state vs Riley Cooper charged with bigamy. Coop er's father went to Mutrie's house Wed nesday afternoon in his absence and in formed his wife that a warrant had been sworn out for his arrest and that his only hope of escaping imprisonment in the penitentiary was to leave the towu at once and never return. Shortly after Cooper's departure two po licemen put in an appearance at the houte on pretense of arresting Mutrie. "When he returned home Mutrie's wife told him what had occurred and he set about investigat ing. The investigation resulted in the discovery that the whole affair was a scheme to get Mutrie out of the way of the pending trial. The prosecuting attorney has obtained a good description of the two police officers and further nnestigatiou on his part will likely result iu Cooper and the police officers having to defend them selves against the serious charge of inter fering with tho prosecution of the law.

"The enterprise failsd" it concludes, "Be cause success in the conditions was not only difficult, but impossible." The St. James Gazette doubts whether Davis will take a historical position as one of the world's great men. The St. James Gazette draws a striking contrast between Davis and some of his famous contemporaries and says: "As Davis de parts from the scene of human activities it is doubtful if a single person outside the immediate circle of his-relatives is affected by a thrill of emotion." still bulling in.

Chairman Piatt ot the senate committee on territories, says he is iu favor of admitting Idaho ter ritory promptly, and that he is ready to make a favorable report upon a bill to that end as soon as it reaches his commit tee. The three or four members of the house who are in line for the chairmanship of the committee lor territories are acting in favor of statehood for Idaho. Delegate Fred Dubois secured favorable action dur ing the last congress to admit Idaho to statehood, and he nas been hard at work since his arrival here working up the nec essary sentiment in favor ef statehood for his territory. Mr. Dubois said today that there was nothing in the way of statehood for Idaho, and that prompt action would be taken upon the bill as soon as it was in troduced.

Degrees of Sanctity and Grades of Itanb Am one Brahsoaus. All Brahmans are not priests, but all priests are Brahmans. This caste claims the most exalted attributes, and according to tho Manu scripture is superior to law, even to moral law, when it interferes with his interests. A Brahman may nol livens a hired servant, but he may take the property of a Sudra. A proper gift to a Brah man on a deathbed will, it is said, se cure heaven to a malefactor, and ih3 Brahman who receives a present froiiv a member of another caste confers at favor on the donor. Tho exaggerated honors originally allowed to the Brahmans are no longer allowed, except, .among tho lowest orders; yet' the Brahman still retains a sort of sacred character and is regarded with ad miration, if not veneration, by the other castes. In theory, at any rate, he retains his supremacy; and there Are parts of India still where low caste Seople account it an honor to take the ust off the feet of a Brahman and to place it on their heads, and even to drink the water in which the feet of the twice born have been washed. But there are degrees of sanctity and grades of rank even among tho select Brahmans, for there are some twenty-five septs of this privileged caste. Tho Brahmans of Mysore, for instance, look down with contempt upon the Brahmans of Benares. Some of the subdivisions will not eat or in termarrv with Che members of other subdivisions; and others again, nota bly in Calcutta, quite openly violate tho laws of their order. For instance, they are forbidden in the sacred writ ings to eat beef, drink v.'ine, wear shoes made of cowhide, or sit down to table with men of inferior caste, or of no caste at all, like Europeans. Yet many eminent Brahman gentle men in the cities now do all tliese things without losing, a3 they would once have done, their place in Hindoo society. Then, again, in the old days, young roon who wont to visit foreign countries and ventured into England had to subject themselves to bevere penance before they could be rein stated in their caste; but now, in most of the Brahman sept3, a Hindoo may do pretty much as he pleases short of receiving Christian baptism. Of course that ostracizes him at once. We have said that all Eralimans are not priests, and also that, accord ing to tho laws of Manu, no Brah man can be a hired servant. Yet, as a matter of fact, they aro to be found occupying positions as clerks, school masters, physicians, engineers, shop keepers, etc. But while the casto wall has thus far been broken down, there is less intermarriage between the castes than there was in the days of Manu. Tho reason is that then the punishment fell upon the children, but now it falls on the offenders them selves. According to the census of 1SS1 there were about 100 different castes in Bengal alone. In alllndia there were 10,546,735 Brahmans, 5,788,735 Rajputs (or Kshatriyasj and

"And you come from a newspaper. It surprises me the versatility of the American woman. I have seen many wonderful things since I came to New York, but mo thing that interests me so much as the woman question, which the American girl is solving for the world. "I dont think the American people realize the worth, the ability, the power or the pos sibilities of their sisters and daughters. It is to me, a conservative .bngllsn woman, marvel. AT THE COLLEGE. "Yes, I went to visit the Normal college, Thursday. I went to gratify a littlo friend, tho daughter of President Hunter, and that is how 1 became so interested in the question. There wera 1,600 young women ia tho audi ence assembled for me for me, think of itl I never had seen so much of my sex at one time, and I cannot tell how strongly I was impressed. Such a throng of youth, beauty, vigor and enthusiasm! I didn't know what to say or how to conduct myself rather suppress myself and before I realized my position, Mr. Hunter had presented mo to the college, aud In the most gracious way pro pared tho expectant pupils for an address. "There was nothing for me to do bit rise and I had never made a speech in my life talk to tho girls. And that's what I did. I can't tell you what I said. I only know how I felt and I also know that I made my listen ers feel the honesty and sincerity of my ad miration for them. "Oh, I noticed everything the precision, the order, the almost military alacrity of the scholars. The action of tho school was like the movement in a clock. In tho march there was tho light step, tho easy grace, the proud carriage and that air of certainty, se curity and conscious satisfaction that I have never seen outside of thQ military. And then tho charm of personality! Youth in itself is beauty, but there was moro than beauty. There was intelligence, intellect and a tan gibility of culture and refinement thnt I never expected to find outaido of au exclu sive society. "At a word 1,800 seats flapped and 1.S00 girls dropped into them. It was instantane ous. One, twol And it was over. I was dumfounded and with just that instantaneity of action every part of tho programme was executed. "ilr. Hunter a$ked tho girls if they wished me to address them and the one round, full volume of tone put into tho laconic 'yes' was simply indescribable. It was like a vavo of sound and it filled my very soul with its in tensity. It was a request, nn appeal, an in vitation and a hand clasp all in three. letters. ' "Ob, ye. 1 did aslc Mr. Hunter where thrf 1,800 husbands were to, come from. I meant it, for 1,600 men worthy of those young women should be more than average men.
