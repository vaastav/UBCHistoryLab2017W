His pay as Senator, | $5,000, is paid by the Secretary, and the i balance, $3 ,000, at the Treasury . j Baron Yon Steuben said to a Cincin nati Reporter : Mr. Blaine is the ^' e ' ! liest, most dignified, and at the same time the most cordial man I have met in this country. It is no wonder to me that this Nation honors him as one of its greatest men, and I have not the slightest doubt that his popularity will increase as time progresses."_ The President's message has been re fused to the Montana press owing to the employment of the wire by the Utah & Northern. It is to be hoped that the Western Union will stretch that second wire, and stretch it quick. Except by the military line, the Territory is virtually shut out from telegraphic communication with the rest of the world. j ; ! Judge Mackey, in his anti-Bourbon speech, gave this description of the pros perity which Bourbon control has brought outli Carolina • "The average planter to $o at the end of each year is so poor that lie owes for the clothes he wears, and average laborer so ragged that if he were to at tempt to cross a forty-acre field and were caught hv a heavy northeast wind lie would he whipped to death by his rags." No w onder South Carolina is ripe for a new departure! Every utterance of our new' President, leaN ing out of account suspicions and ru mors, has shown him superior to the esti mate of his warmest friends and admirers. Most of the time he remains silent, but w hen he can hold silence no longer he speaks to the purpose. The contest over the Speakership has been exceedingly sharp, and a word from the President could easily incline the trembling scale either wav. But no entreaty or influence of any , . ,, , j . ... , kind has extorted an expression positive . * ... j.j . or negative in favor of either candidate. , T „ l* He tells all comers to stop faction making . . , . .

The Presi- ; dent evidently intends to unite and conso lidate the Republican party. He has a higher ambition than to serve a faction, to gratify revenge. Vice-Presidents general ly have been conspicuous failures. No man ever had a more difficult place to fill, and so far no one could possibly have filled it more creditably. 

MEETING OF CONGRESS. Though we are accustomed to weary of Congress after a time, especially when it has become evident that little if anything more can be accomplished and one or the other party is engaged in obstruction, there are reasons especially strong this year why interest should be keen and gen eral in the meeting and action of the na tional legislators. There are some nega tive as well as positive reasons for this general interest. It will be some relief to get something from Washington besides the sickening daily reports of the Guiteau trial and the Christiancy divorce case. We have refrained as much as possible from giving so much space and attention to these trials, but really there is little else that comes over the wire. People hardly realize w r hat a daily cost to the country this wretched creature and his trial have been. Counting the cost of running the court, the time of all the men and women who are busied as spectators in Washing ton or as readers and commentators on ; the passing features of the trial, the cost of ! telegraphing, publishing, etc., and the sum total is fearful. It would have been bet- ! ter for the country to have lost outright | a hundred millions of dollars rather than j thig m i sera ble, worthless wretch had ever ! been born. Somehow and some time it ; ma y a PP ear > »a faith »»"res m, t ha t Ibis ' has a11 been for the best, but as yet it **»» » » *"« *7* * &ith " ** human vision. There are hundreds and j thousands throughout this land whose I formally cry i Sj "How long, O Lord, how fong!" shall this vile wretch who has rob- j bed us of our great and good President be j allowed to insult, tax and afflict us. We look for relief to the assembling 0 f ega the present wee k. itbidsfairto b . . bc an interesting scsslon from the vei T ; The Senate . g partially organized, . .... * . .

After the organization is complete L and a few votes taken the country will know pretty well what to expect, and curi- j osity will shift its perch, There will be such a close division of ; parties in both houses that we need not ! fook for the passage of any extreme party | measure. It is very doubtful if any very j important measures of any kind can be perfected into laws. We hope to see some ji dng do ne to annihilate Mormonism. We would like to see tlic improvement of ^{ ie Mississippi begun on a national scale, want to see Dakota admitted as a gtate, an d would like it better if Wash -1 ington> Montana and New Mexico could 1 be brought in at the same time. Tliere ought also to be some sensible refunding ac t adopted that would enable our Secre tar ^ ^ ie Treasury to take advantage of the low rates of interest and the enhancing credit of the government. We want to see a law establishing the postal savings bank system and a good deal more legis lation to carry out the suggestions of our present Postmaster-General. The interest of the public will not be i exhausted in watching the organization of the Senate or the House, but will be fully i .. ....... u _____ __ rx,. ! as much attracted to the utterances of our new President, whose Cabinet and other appointments will be scanned and criti cised to the utmost. Let us thank God and take courage that we are likely to have some relief and diversion from a monotony of misery and disgust. One of the London medical journals declares that the great prevalence of neu ralgia—or what commonly goes by that name—should be regarded as a warning indicative of a low condition of health, which must necessarily render its subjects peculiarly susceptible to the invasion of disease of an aggressive type. It is always essential that the vital forces should be vigorous, and the nerve power, in especial, in full development ; but neuralgia indi cates a low' or depressed state of vitality— a poor and weak state—and should be promptly placed under treatment. The Vicksburg Herald jubilates over i the fact that the Yankees are agafn invad- j ing the South. It says: "About twenty years ago they came with fire and sword, but now they come to invest their money in factories, railroads, plantations and banks." It is a cheerful thing to hear the friendly aud welcoming remarks of a rep resentative Southern journal. It says the , .. , Yankees are whooping up things all / * , ... along the line, and propose to fight it out ' „ f. r .._ 6 . a until vou can t tell the difference betw'een » a Northern aud a Southern citizen. They are marrying Southern girls," etc. The Herald asserts that the "Yanks have cap tured Atlanta, Richmond, Charleston and New Orleans, and there is a report that a raid will soon be made on Vicksburg." It is the tone in whicli these facts are stated, rather than the facts themselves, which indicate the extent to which the war line is being abolished. The process may be slow, but it seems to be sure. NEW 

MEDICINE. Accounts from Caldwell, Kansas, repre sent that the victims of a failing bank President have got him in hand and pro pose to hang him unless he disgorges. While opposed to lynch law in theory, we are not sure but there are occasions when it is just the medicine that the case de mands. We all know that there are cases of sickness in which all the usual reme dies fail when some one comes forward with a treatment that would never have been thought of, much less tried, under ordinary circumstances, and it astonishes all with a cure. The law, which answers to the usual medical treatment, has hitherto found no j remedy to cure those who are handling j other people's money from using it as their own. Generally the money is lost before j it is known, gambling in stocks; some -1 times it is run away with or invested in the name of others. Then follow compro mises as with the common class of bur ; glars. All this mild treatment encourages ! rather than prevents crime. The law is slow and inexpe r t, generally costing all or ! niore than is recovered. It would not be | a bad idea to hang a few of these default- { j ers just to notice the effect of a new kind j ! of medicine; if it works well it may be a ; safe basis for some new legislation more i ' efficaci°us. ; It is a recognized principle in law that " ' he , »«"«»»"7 *> "P* " j crime the greater the penalty. It is a I sound principle, but too often overlooked, tbe Kansas victims of Danford's de- j j biult will hang him till his neck is broken j or the wind is out of his body, it may not f?* ve them back their lost money, but it will prevent many more from losing the sal »e way.

AN 

AVENGER WANTED. It is an old proverb that "a barking dog send i ng threatening letters to Judge Cox and the mem fi ers 0 f the jury, they had seldom bites." If there are 20,000 Gar fi e j d avengers, as some scribblers pretend,, w j îo are ei)gaged j n the sillj^ljusiuess of better c fi aU g e their names and plans of action> We should not slied a tear if Guiteau were shot, and the quicker it were doue the better we should like it. The j dea tfi a t this whole American people must stand on j] ie püfory for three months, ag g rava t e d and insulted bv the monkey-shines L nd gibberish of this crank> is euough a ] most to create an avenger out of the dust. It does not want 20,000, nor more than one. It does not want even one who will I write silly, threatening letters to Judge ! or jury, who arc simply doing the best they can to run the machine which is j placed in their hands. It would be much i less a crime to shoot Guiteau than to write ! such letters. The man who can earn the ' gratitude of the whole people is anxiously looked for and has a fine opening for fame and fortune. camp in South Carolina There is a lively disturbance in the Judge T. J. Mackey has made a speech which indicates a willingness on his part to be come a sort of Mahone for his State. He said there was at present very little, if any, progress in South Carolina, and that prosperity would never return until a rad ical change was made in the political af fairs of the State. He advocated a com promise by tjie whites with the blacks, and believed the two should work out their fortunes t0 * ether shoulder to shoul - der ' He tl,ou S ht S reat in J u9tice "' as donc tbe colored l )eo P lc in not allowin S theln a ^Li 1 representation in the Legislature. So long as the race issue was injected into the political campaigns and party lilies were drawn so rigidly as to make it criminal for men to express their real sentiments, just so long would Northern men and Northern capital shun the soil of South Carolina, and just so long would the State ! remain in the background of progress. | . black or white, Northerner or Southerner, He wanted to see the dav w'hen anv man, ! could come into the State aud express his | political sentiments w ithout the apprehen- j sfon of fear lor his person or property, The significant portions of the Judge's speech were heartily applauded. When ; he had finished he was followed by several ! Democratic speakers, who said they fully , agreed with him. This looks like a bad i Bourbon earthquake in South Carolina. J. Warren Kiefer, who succeeds Samuel Randall as Speaker of the House Representatives, represents the 4th Ohio district, and is now' serving his third i 11 Congress. Gen. Keifer has anen v ^ a ^ ie soldier record, ami in the leader S ^P °* the House has held a prominent , »1 ii* . , place on the Repub. ican side of the cham- • ber. He is an able and ready debater and ! has lew' equals as a presiding officer His „1 ; a c \i tit \ • ; support came ch.efly from the West, m-! Ci'iding the Pacific coast members. Gov. j Pacheco was one of his enthusiastic friends and brought to his standard no inconsid erable following. Hiscock, of New York, who figured second in the race, is a Stal wart in politics as in physique. Bourbon politics and policies in Texas threaten disaster to the party there as in Virginia. Dissatisfied Democrats, Inde pendents and Greenbackers propose a co alition with* the Republicans on Governor and other State officers. Democrats are scared. & — OUR 

NAVY. The Secretary of the Navy, in his an nual report, says something must be done or we shall soon have no navy. Our com merce is declining as well as our navy. If it is essential that we maintain a navy, we surely ought to do something, for it will cost us much more after having let our es j officers of our Navy Department and naval j establishment that it was the headquarters 0 f 0 ld-fogyism ; that it used up the most j mon ey in the construction of the most un serviceable hulks of any department of the Government. Certainly none will* cfoim that the heads of this department, w fthin the memory of man, were ever se Jccted with any reference to qualifications a nd for the purpose of increasing its effi tablishment go to pieces to build it up again from the foundation. The Secretary calls for twenty-five millions for his de partment—a very large sum to expend on a worthless navy, and a small sum to build up a match for the naval armaments of foreign powers. It has always been charged against the ciency. Our country was justly proud of the achievements of its navy in the war { 0 f 1812, and there were some creditable j chapters of naval history added during our civil war. We can aiways count on i heroes for any emergency, and they are ; just as apt to come from outside as inside the regular organization. We "* *» »» > > »f iblc ^nger of any foreign w r ar, and still less, thank God, of another civil w'ar. We are very fortu j lia tcly removed from the great theatre of conflict which absorbs the attention and j wealth 0 f the continental powers. We are j t favorably situated in time and space to : enter upon an entirely new departure in , the naval line. Why not abandon entirely j Gi c \ *i i* the purpose of building another war ves- L se l and expend all that we have ordinarily : . .• • i- | spent this way in granting subsidies for i new mail ship lines and in expeditions of ! f discovery and research, leaving the war purposes entirely secondary. Our naval officers could be assigned positions and active duties on mail steamers, and each of such vessels could be furnished with a slight armament of the best kind, in the use of which the crew' should be well drilled. UI111CU- . . J The training supp ie in the mere îant sei ' R e would a ^ ^ be go ° sai rj ™ s 1 . we should need if war ever arose. The best military talent in the late war was found not among those w'ho had spent their lives in the service, but after a mili tary education had gone into civil life. We must devise a way of letting in new life and vigor into our military and naval establishments or they will always and necessarily degenerate and deteriorate. aim at anything more than to Lot us no keq) up an experimental navy, employing the best talent for the luventl0n ol t,ie best means of defense, making it entirely j s subsidiar - v to the building up of our com-1 mcrcbl ^. marbie ' . j The time has come in Üie history of the j world that the arts and interests of peace j h and fn< ; lldly commcrce should outrank j tbe ministers and appliances of war, ^und ! our nation is the one to lead the world out of its old wasteful, hurtful, degrading and destructive ruts, and strike out a new path in which to lead the nations. We would never build another purely war vessel, but turn every one that we now have into something that could be of service to com merce and peace. What of our vessels not needed for voyages of exploration could be used for laying ocean cables, and any not needed for these purposes should j be sold or destroyed. Our naval *»*»! should be dispersed throughout mail steamers and in the merchant service, per haps on half-pay from Government. Every dollar that is hereafter spent on a navy should have first reference to utility for purposes of peace rather than war. It is too large a matter to develop in tbe space at our command, but we can give an idea of something that every reader can elabo rate and that is not only possible but cer biVn Cbett'r° n 1,1 " d " 1C S °° nCr ! - !

George Hurst came m from Red Bluff j Thursday. He informs us that the 480-foot I tun%l of the Red Bluff lode was run into ! the vein on Friday evening of last week, and the showing in the mine at this depth is be- j yond expectations. In running across the | vein thenmnersjiave develoyed two feet of very rich ore, such as was shipped to Omaha ei last year, worth $1,100 to the ton. Besides they have run across five feet ol base ore, richer than any that has been taken out of j he i^e, and aïe not ttrough the vein yet. This tunnel taps the vein 400 feet tbe °U working, 120 feet below' watei level, and about 220 feet from the surface. We are glad to learn that the an ticipations of the owners—Judge H. N. Blake & Co.—have been so fully realized, and that they have such good prospects. The com pletion of this tunnel, and the consequent working of the Red Bluff mine, will give a great impetus to the growth and progress of the district, as well as to the mining inter ests of Madison county generally. The tun nel has been more than a year in course of construction, and has been cut under the management and supervision of J. J. Lown — Madisonian. 8U n eu iy and desperately, "I have felt re A DAMAGING ADMISSION. Judge Porter's sharp and masterly cross examination of Guiteau closed dramatic ally, on the 3d. "Do you feel any re morse," was the final question which the great lawyer asked. After having been pressed earnestly upon this point for some moments the prisoner answered at last. morse of course, as far as my personal feel ings are concerned." Judge Porter, quick as lightning said, "That w'ill do, prisoner; your cross-examination is closed." Guiteau, writhing under the tre mendous force of Judge Porter's question, saw the terrible effect of his confession. During all these months one part of his defense has been to insist to all that he never had had a single sentiment of re morse. During the cross-examination he said a dozen times, to Judge Porter's ques tions, that his mind w as a blank upon that subject. To all the experts who called upon him he has insisted w'ith pertinacity that a thought of remorse never came to him ; that his mind upon that subject was a blank. Yet at the close of the rigid cross-examination the prisoner admitted that which seemed to bring sadness to his relatives and caused a sensation in court. He had killed the President and suffered remorse. With cat-like quickness Guiteau rallied from what seemed almost like a paralysis caused by the tremendous thun dering of Judge Porter at him, and en deavored to correct what he plainly saw w r as the effect of that admission. J udge Porter would not listen to a w'ord, but j wa j ved } ds band.

There were sonn some words, says an eye-witness, which almost caused him to wince with terror. He shrank and seemed to shiver in the witness box when Judge Porter used the words "murder," "kill," "assassin." Judge Por ter made it clear that Guiteau was able to control the Divine presence the day Mrs. J Garfield came to the depot with the Presi den ^ and emphasized the fact, which has such an important bearing upon the ques tion of responsibility. The cross-exami nation was eminently successful. It lifted the mask and showed that the plot to mur der the President was premeditated and deliberate, and was the result of malice and revenge. The prisoner felt it keenly. Porter broke down the wonderful, quick, supple witness. The old Duke of Wellington carried llis punctiliousness and sense of justice into every transaction.

Four days ago, Harry Weston, foreman of the Gold Park Mining Company, was shot and killed byBagley, a discharged blacksmith Bagley also made an unsuccessful attempt to shoot Superintendent Turney, and then for tified himself in his cabin, which was imme diately surrounded by a mob. The cabin was beseiged for eight hours without dis lodging the occupant. Finally a large quan tity of giant powder was placed near the door and ignited. The explosion following tore the cabin to pieces and Bagley was found with a bullet hole through his heart haviug evidently committed suicide. Bag ley has several friends who have threatened to take Turney's life and a strong guard sur rounds his cabin day and night. Jack White and Bagley's friends w r ere ordered to go im mediately out of camp by the Vigilantes and they paraded the town with a pair of cocked revolvers in search of the committee but left at night. Much trouble is anticipated. War Department Report. Washington, December 3.—The report of the Secretary of War recommends an in crease of the army to 30,000, as Sherman suggests. The various topics of change in the army chief's report are commented on. Attention is called to the coast defenses, which are regarded by the Secretary as very essential. He believes in a high standard of admission into the military academy. The expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ending June 30,1881, were $42, 122,000. The appropriations for 1882 were $44,889.900.__ Dillon Items. [Tribune Dec. 3d.] Private dispatches from the east confirm the reports of the sale of mining property belonging to Phil Shennon and others at Baunaek. We learn from Mr. H. J. Hoppy, of Glen dale, that the citizens of that town have raised a fund and purchased buildings about a mile from town, and established a pest house for the small-pox. The house already has one inmate. Glendale has a complete working health organization and deserves great credit for the promptness displayed in preventing the spread of small-pox. Mr. Wm. Shineberger, County Treasurer, appears to have more friends than anybody. Since his arrival in town a stream of callers from far and near may he seen trying to pull the knob oft' his door.

[Inter Mountain, December 5tli.] No new small-pox cases are reported, all the patients are doing well and it is believed that the scare is over to a great extent. How ever, vigilance should not be relaxed in the sligliest degree. Thus far the snow fall in the main range east of Butte is so light the wood contractors, even at an elevation of several thousand feet above Butte, have been compelled to dis pense with sleds and to fall back on wheels. This is almost unprecedented. A young son of Miles Kavauaugh yester day met with a painful accident at the Mo doc mine. A ladder reared against a build ing fell and striking him on the head knock ed him into insensibility. It was feared for some time that lie was dead, but conscious ness gradually returned and under the care of Dr. Whitford he is rapidly recovering. Wooden Boilers for Steam. The almost incredible feast of making steam boilers of wood was accomplished 7b years ago in Philadelphia, where they were used to furnish steam to the pumps, for pump ing up the river wdter, for the use of the city water works. They, however, lasted only two years, when it became so difficult to keep them steam-tiglit that they were abandoned for iron boilers. How was it possible to heat water in wooden boilers ? It was accomplish ed by having au iron fire box 12 ft. long, (> ft. wide, and 2 ft. deep, placed inside a rec tangular wooden chest, 14 ft. long, and 9 ft. square, made of plank nearly half a foot thick, securely bolted together by iron rods passing through the planks. The iron fire box had eight vertical flues of one foot iu diameter, through which the water circulated and around which the fire acted, and passed up ward through an oval flue, first above the tire box, carried from the back of the boiler to near the front and back again, when it passed out into the chimney. It was expected that these boilers would be very econiouical, on account of the nou-producting property of wood ; and so they were to a certain extent, as the boilers did not need any protecting covering, but, as already stated, they did not last, and cast-iron boilers were substituted and used untill 1822, when water power was substituted for steam-power in the Fairinonut water works. Areas of States and Territories The tenth census includes with its other valuable statistics new tables of areas of the United States, the States, their counties and of the paincipal inland lakes lyimr iu w hole or in part within any of the State;. The river areas of the Mississippi valley average one square mile of river to 200 of land.

A great gun was recently east at Reading Pa., in the presence of a large number ol naval and military men, who were invite! guests of the managers of the Scott works ot the Reading Iron Company. So far as known, or can be ascertained until the iron cools, and the cannon taken to be finished, the casting was successful. It is what is termed an accelerating cannou, aud is twenty-live feet in length, with a six-inch bore. Along the bore are four additional pockets for powder, holding twenty-eight pounds each, W'hich are successively discharged after the ball is started by the discharge of eighteen pounds in the breech chamber. It is calcu lated that 130 pounds of power will throw an iron projectile weighing 150 pounds at least ten miles, and that it will perforate through a solid mass of wrought iron two feet thick. It is claimed by the inventor that a velocity of 3,000 feet per second wi be attained by his gun.
