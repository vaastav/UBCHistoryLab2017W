Martin W. Littleton, the New York lawyer who bag been more or lest prominent in the councils of the dem ocratlc party since he made the speech placing Judge Parker in nomination at St. Louis in 1904, has been telling the Southern Society of New York what the democratic party roust do to be saved. Ills first suggestion is that It should establish and maintain a bu reau at Washington for the purpose of detecting the shortcomings of the ad ministration and reporting them for the benefit of democratic editors and orators. The plan is not complimentary to Champ Clark, the minority leader at Washington, and the correspondents of the democratic newspapers who are supposed to make republican short comings a part of their regular order of business. The Littleton suggestion, however, is Just another Illustration that the democratic party, instead of being a party of opposition, Is simply a party of negation. Instead of pre senting a constructive policy and of fering a solution of any of the many problems confronting the people, it Is content to rear back In the traces and denounce the efforts of the republican party to meet such issues Intelligently. Instead of proposing remedies that commend themselves to the Intelli gence of the people, the democratic party has been content with the role of faultfinder and obstructionist. NATIONAL BANK FAILURES. The report of the comptroller of the currency throws an Interesting sidelight on the causes of national bank failures, showing, as it does, that more than 90 per cent of them might be averted by more careful su pervision on the part of the directors and officers of the banks. On this point Comptroller Murray says: Noting the cause of failure of banks placed In charge of receivers during the year. It appears that seven banks were wrecked by the cashier, one by defalcation of officers, and three chiefly through fraudulent management, among other causes. Of the remainder, four failed from excessive loans to others and de preciation of securities, etc.; three by rea aon of injudicious banking; two from ex- esalve loans to directors and others, and two from depreciation of . securities; one from failure of large debtors, and one from general stringency In the money market. ' ' According to this report only one of the twenty-four national banks .which failed in the last fiscal year was closed "from general stringency in the money market" In each of the other twenty-three cases, either the crooked ness of officials or the negligence of directors and officers caused the fail ures. The report furnishes all the ustlflcatlon needed by the comptroller for his decision to strengthen bank in spection and make bank directors per sonally" responsible for the conduct of the institutions with which they are connected. His new rules require re ports at stated intervals from every director of a national batik showing whether he has personally acquainted himself with the affairs of his Institu tion. These reports are to be kept on file in the office of the " comptroller and will furnish 8 complete answer to the "didn't know" claim too often ad vanced by bank directors when the banks get into financial stress. THE FUNCTION OF A GRAND JURY. There seems to be a wide, difference of opinion in various quarters as to what, constitutes the function of a grand jury. The last grand jury which sat here handed in a lengOhy report containing thinly-veiled accu sations against all sorts of people In public and private life, together with recomendations which, if carried out, would make the grand jury the real governing body. The report was re ceived by the judge In charge with manifest approval and an expression of thanks to the jurymen. Almost at the very same time that this grand jury reported a grand jury closed its labors in New York City with a few passing criticisms and recommendations, which, however, called forth from the presiding judge distinct and scathing rebuke. This is what Judge Dike said to the New York grand jury that presumed to tell how the government should be run: Criticisms of a public official by mem bers of a grand jury reach the ears of a community with the added force and power of the body making the charge. wnetner tne cnarge he raise or true, It would have In any event a serious and perhaps lasting effect on that official. It would tend to hamper the proper ad ministration of his office, and thus ulti mately . seriously affect the. public wel fare. '"' If officials are unjust or, unfair tee remedy of the cltlsen U to apply to thoae having power to compel a correction of the acts complained of. If no redress Is granted and the great mass of the citl- sens believe that an Injustice ha- been done by a wrongful offlcal act, the rem edy Is In their hands. But If every grievance of cltlaens against the policy or procedure of their officials was to become the apeclal subject of investiga tion by the grand Jury they would quickly loae tbe dignity they now poasesa and would become embroiled with political situations with which they have nothing to do. You will recall that when instructing you. Immediately after you were , aworn In, I laid atreaa on this point that a grand Jury apaaks by indictment. It la the effective and final expression of that body. 8o in conclusion I would aay that un leaa a grand Jury, after serious ionld oration of the legal evidence before them, have found an Indictment, they should not make a presentment against an offi cial or any Individual in the spirit of criticism or vague accusation containing suggestions for the administration of his Office. Such mattera can be left to the people to redress If they feel a wrong has bean done. It certainly Is not the function, and never waa Intended to be the function, of the grand Jury. . The New York judge says that It is not the function of a grand jury, when not so expressly invested by liv, to do anything but to bring In indict ments where the evidence gives reasonable presumptioa of guilt. Our judge here, however, seem to think that the grand jury function includes & general dissertation upon the ad ministration of public affairs and a complete license to reflect by innuendo upon any or every local official.

CANADIAN BOUNDARY. Announcement Is made that the final report will be made to the pres ent congress of the findings of a joint commission on the fixing of the bound ary line between the United States and Canada, a question that has been in dispute since the close of the war of the revolution. Most of the troubles have been In the northeast, along the borders of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York. The present commission, which Is composed of en gineers of the two countries, has es tablished permanent monuments and It Is expected that future disputes will be avoided. 1 In Andrew Jackson's time this conn- try came near going to war with Eng land over the disputed claims of Maine and Canada to a strip of land that was not capable of producing much of anything but trouble. The country later became wrought up over the "Fifty-four-Forty or Fight" slo gan, but the fight was averted. An other dispute arose over the boundary In Minnesota and the map line shows that the engineers of those days cared very little, or knew little, about paral lels and straight lines, but took the most accessible route between, given points and let it go at that. The two nations have spent more for commissions and engineers than the value of the disputed territory, but that is the usual history of com missions. With the completion of the Canadian Boundary commission's work, we will have nothing to quarrel about except the . Alaskan boundary, which .has been in dispute since this country acquired that territory. 

BUSINESS AND GOLD EXPORTS. Bankers and Treasury department officials have failed to agree as to the significance, or lack of It, of the re cent exports of American gold to Eu rope. That It has no real bearing on the trade and Industrial conditions of the country is pretty generally as serted and that it may continue for an indefinite period is not improbable. Perhaps the best explanation is found in the London reports of large buying there of American securities, particularly of the newly announced bond Issues, both government and in dustrial, for which there Is a consid erable European demand. During the panic and in fear of the federal and state legislation against " certain classes of corporations, European In vestors began unloading; bonds and stocks in those companies, creating a demand for gold that has not yet been checked. With the renewed European demand for new American securities, .the. gold exports may be curtailed, although this demand may be offset, so far as gold transactions are concerned, by the increased import trade of this country, evidences of which are already being manifested. It must be remembered, too, that France and Germany are both hoard ing gold at this time, France for the purpose of negotiating the proposed Russian loan and Germany for the purpose of meeting maturing obliga tions. These conditions naturally stimulate a demand for gold, a de mand that this country, can well af ford to meet, as It has Imported more than $200,000,000 of European gold in the last five years and has' a reserve stock In no danger of being: reduced to the danger point. THE RED CROSS CHRISTMAS STAMP. It is cause for regret that the peo ple of the west are not showing the enthusiasm prevalent in the east over the Red Cross Christmas, stamp as one of the features of the Christmas season. It is not yet too late to learn about this stamp and to take advan tage of the opportunities it offers for contributions to the war against tuber culosis. k The Christmas stamps will not carry anything through the malls. The government will not honor them In payment of duties and they will not be taken at the shops In exchange for goods, but they have a buying power, nevertheless. They will buy national relief from an international scourge. The proceeds from the sale of these stamps are to be devoted entirely to the work of eradicating consumption by caring for those afflicted and safe guarding the country against its spread. The stamps are Issued by the Na tional Red Cross society, of which Mr. Taft Is president. They are to be af fixed to letters and packages as an expression of good cheer and a con tribution to a much-needed fund for a worthy purpose. There is no limit to the number of these stamps that may be affixed to packages and letters and they cost 1 cent each. The people everywhere should avail themselves of the privilege of aiding in such a wor thy movement. Mr. Bryan says he will not have any part in the distribution of patronage to be handed out to the faithful In Ne braska by the incoming democratic governor and legislature. This means that Mr. Bryan will, as usual, sit Idly by without raising a protest against any notorious, rascal or recognized rogue applying for preferment on the strength of the local democratic vic tory. Over In Illinois something of a scandal has been stirred up by .the resignation of a state bank examiner, accompanied by the disclosure that he bad been favored with free railway passes and extra work at good pay from the very institutions he was sup- posed to be checking up and the ethics of the transaction are being debated in the public prints. It Is safe to ssy that this condition of affairs is not confined to Illinois, or at least has not been so, and that both state and fed eral bank examiners have in the past ridden free oh the trains and collected mileage. The argument for putting bank examiners on salaries and mak ing there turn . in receipted vouchers for expense accounts Is unanswerable. The alluring prospect is held out that' Nebraska's state debt will be completely . extinguished within a period of a little more than a year and that after that we may expect the tax rate to be reduced by taking off the special levy made to sink the debt. We have all heard' of reduced tax rates in prospect, which, however, seldom materialize because other ways of spending the money are de vised, and this is another case where the taxpayers will prefer to be shown. Mr. Bryan complains that the news papers sent out false reports of his shooting experiences in Texas. News papers should ' learn that it is not necessary to misrepresent Mr. Bryan, as the truth about him is as strange as fiction. Chairman Mack denies the report that he has quarrelled with other members of the democratic national committee. There does not seem to be much for them to quarrel about. Testimony shows that most of the big trusts are Interested In byproducts and side lines, but It has not been shown that the Powder trust is back ing the Undertakers .trust. It Is not believed that plans for the improvement of the inland waterways will be abandoned juBt because Speaker Cannon Is opposed to the issue of bends for the purpose. King Edward has breakfast at 9 o'clock, luncheon at 2, tea at 5, sup per at 7 and another supper at mid night. Apparently be Is too busy to stop for dinner. Rev.

The combination of all the powdermakers of the world to divide the earth among them a 150,000 tine to be paid by any party to the agreement encroaching upon for bidden territory furnishes a new argument for Intel-rational arbitration. A peace ccm blr atlon would be the best protection against a gunpowder trust. Padd'nhrad Wilson's Dream. Boston Transcript. When Mark Twain wrote "Pudd'nhead Wilson" he doubtless little dreamed that In emphasizing v the fad upon which the fortunes of his hero turned he was offer ing a suggestion that would subsequently be made of wide practical value. Last week Henry Taylor, ft Puyallup Indian made his "mark" in the registration of fice by making an imprint of his thumb after dipping it in green Ink, and he was the first of his race In the state of Wash lngton to thus Identify himself. This was In accordance with a new ruling of the Indian bureau which haa adopted this method of Identification, especially among Indians, in order to prevent forgeries which have been too numerous. rUKSO.AL.

HOIXD ABOUT .KW TOHK. Ripples on tUe Cnrrent of Life la the Metropolis. Since Harry. Lehr s celebrated monkey dinner, A few years ago, nothing has hap pened to raise New York's social fonldnm to proper heights of testacy until Miss Ku do r a S. Sinclair's tea party lit -honor of her 2-year-old Boston terrier. The function was pulled off last Saturday In a local hotel. The affair was attended from 3 to 5 In the afternoon by dogs of every description, among them many bench show winners and others of high degree, all accompanied by their mistresses. The animals frolicked at will about a parlor set aside for their own use, while their owners amused them selves in various ways and partook of re freshments, shared simultaneously by the dogs. The psrty was literally a "howling suc cess," and the four-footed aristocrats lap ped wine punch and ate Ice cream, aerved by tWo waiters. The decorations were elaborate. Pictures of dogs adorned the walls and tables were strewn with red carnations and ferns. The Ice cream was In dog forms and the favors were candy- filled dogs and mottoes. On one table wa a large frosted birthday cake, bordered with tiny silk American flags and having one lighted candle in the center. There was also a "Jack Horner" pie, from which each "guest" received a gift suited to the occasion. The honeymoon trip of Captain Hud son, skipper of the Bath (MatnpV schooner Henry Clauson, Jr., and his bride last month waa thrilling In the extreme, ac cording to details of their experiences on board that Ill-fated vessel, which, after numerous vicissitudes, finally burned In mid-ocean. The newly married couple and crew, finally rescued by a passing steamer, were taken to Messina, and it Is from there that account of their experiences has reached New York City. The Clausen, a three-master, waa bound from Qulfport, Miss., to the Azores, lumbrr-landen. When some 600 miles from St Michaels, Its port of desttnntlon, on November 10. a hurri cane began to tear away everything above decks, and for three daya kept the little company of eight in terror, relieved only by Mrs. Hudson's bravo singing of hymns and recounting of Bible stories. The schooner sprang a leak, and all the focd was under water. Just as It seemed that the vessel must go to pieces a steamer was sighted. It proved to be the Snow- donla, and all were rescued in lifeboats. Hardly were they aboard when smoke be gan to pour from the Clausen, and soon the wreck was ablaze. A canned trousseau is the latest In the lino of tinned goods. When the customs Inspectors came to open the trunk of Domlnlco Petrucclo, passenger from Italy on the Koenlgln L.uise, they, came across several tin cases carefully sealed. A can opener was produced by the car penter on the pier. The first box was about eighteen Inches long, ton Inches wide, and two Inches deep. When part of the lid had been cut away there was disclosed an antique garment of red silk and lace. Petrucclo handled the dress reverently and pressed it to his Hps. It was the wedding gown of his mother and had. been also the wedding gown of his grand mother, great-grandmother, and several grandmothers preceding. In othe cases were faded slippers, cor sets, and various articles of feminine at tire. In El Paso, Tex., Petrucclo explained, was Maria Consentlno, his adored, who was going to wear the ancestral bridal outfit next week. The appraiser sold the entire wardrobe was worth $2.30 and Petrucclo need pay no duty to Uncle Sam. NearlV t282.000.000 will have to ha rnunted as sdon as George S. Terry takes charge of the subtreasury in New York. Following the retirement of Assistant Treasurer Hamilton Fish, which took place October 31, Treasurer Charles H. Treat has been In personal charge of the bg govern ment bank. The retiring assistant treas urer cannot be released from his responsi bilities until the count ' Is finished and the new assistant treasurer assumes charge. The count will require twenty or more experts and a force of laborers to handle the sacks of gold and sliver. The sacks of coin are counted by weight, but out of every hundred sacks probably a dozen will be unsealed and counted to prove the weights. In the subtreasury at present there are: Gold coin, $170,000,000; silver dollars, $78,000, 000; fractional silver, $2,800,000; pennies and nickels, $300,000; gold coin certificates, $30, 000.000 sliver coin certificates, $400,000; treas ury notes, $300,000; total, $281,800,000. Disappointed Itecause he had failed to solve the problem of perpetual motion, Ru pert Potschacher of Hit Avenue A, com mitted suicide by inhaling illuminating gas. For several yeara he had worked on a wheel which he figured would turn for ever. He thought he had perfected his in vention several days ago and felt that at last fortune was within his grasp. He had set up the wheel In his room and for hours at a time he watched It turn. Potschacher went out for a walk Sunday and when he returned to his room he found the wheel had stopped. His efforts to solve the problem of perpetual motion were a failure. The disappointment was so crushing that he did not want to live. He attached one end of a rubber pipe to the Jet of a gas stove and placed the other end in his mouth. Then he turned on the gas. The Iron heel of despotism Is on the poor, oppressed clerks In the comptroller's office in New York City. The charter provides that the public offices shall be open from Mo 1. It has been the practice hitherto to let the clerks go as soon as the offices were closed to the public, but the charter says nothing about that; bank clerks have to stay after the doors are closed to cus tomers, and the comptroller has Issuedan order that on and after January 4 clerks in the finance department must work from 9 to 5, with an hour for lunch. 

NATIONAL tOB.M KXl'OSITIOX. Importance of the Great Cereal to the Middle West. Minneapolis Journal. Cotton is king was once the talk. Corn Is king is nearer to the mark these days. The National Corn exposition at Omaha is to celebrate that economic fact and U hot or the king. The "corn belt" Is something unique in the world. There are other wheat lands than our own, there axe other cotton fields, but where is a land ct golden maiaa except here at home. One hundred thousand ears of com have been entered at the exposition to strive in competition for the big premiums offered for those adjudged most "thoroughbred." Borne lucky ten ears of corn will win $2,&u0. Just $250 per ear, which is a handsome prize. Over $i0.000 will be paid In premiums. "The cornfed philosopher" was once, and may be still, tbe butt of ribald Jest In a certain aupertor publication dewn east, but corn looms up higher every year as serious fact, so that even those once dls posed to make light of It are recognizing that It cultivation has become the cor nerstone of our agricultural temple. The corn lands of the middle wst rise In value. The farmers situated upon those lands are the most prosperous ag-icultural tious when raised with 1 Made from Crapes population In the world. And the culture of the plant grows In perfection and also In expansion.. When, through the operation of obvious economio causes, the production of wheat shrinks, as It must rn the near future, corn will still be conquering more and more acres every year. New Industrial uses for the plant are being discovered. Soon no part of It, from stalk to cob, will be waste. So great Is tbe demand for corn this year that Kansas Is finding It too valuable to feed to Texan cattle. Texan cattle, therefore, are stay ing in Texas this winter and will be put upon the market without fattening. We Americans eat corn. Europe esteems it ss a food for cattle. But Europe Is sur rendering to missionary effort. However, the chances are that about the time Europe has developed an appetite for corn, corn will be too valuable to serve as an European staple.
