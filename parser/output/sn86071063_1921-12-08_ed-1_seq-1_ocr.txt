Signs of Unrest Continue Lisbon, Dev. 7.?Signs of unrest continue to be evident in this city for some weeks after the revolutionary outbreak of October 10 when ex-Pre n i a A i I nuer urunjo ana iavo omers were assassinated. y\ For at least two weeks after that occuience, manifestations were made! by the revolutionaries who demanded j that the government put into opera-1 tion the revolutionary program. Posters appeared on the walls of buildings calling upon the people to rise i and rebel against those who were al- i leged to be "driving them to starvation" and demanding that the government resign if it did not know how to govern. One demonstration was made outside the Ministry of the Interior when a revolutionary officer, Major Salustiano Cofreia, delivered a i speech in which de declared that ; "should the revolutionary program j not be strictly fulfilled, I and all true republicans will again seize our arm? to bring about the ends for which the revolt of October 19 was made."

TARIFF QUESTION GIVEN ATTENTION Washington, Dec. 7.?President Harding's sugglstion for flexible tariff rates and a provision for proclaimed American valuation apparently have been well - received by many of the Republican members of congress charged with the drafting of tariff legislation, but a formal decision on them by the senate finance committee is likely to be deferred until the tariff measure is started, probably next month. Chairman Penrose of the senate committee plans to confer soon with the leading Republicans of the house ways and means committee regarding the subject. He said today that he had heard much favorable comment on the president's suggestion, adding that ho and other members of the committee had discussed the pioposals with the executive before they were presented to congress by Mr. Harding yesterday. Senator Penrose expressed the opinion that careful thought would have to be given to the matter of delegating authority to the president to change tho rate or proclaim American valuation as the basis for assessing duties as changing conditions might warrant. Amendments to the house bil prescribing the means of making the grant of authority already have been proposed by Senator Smoot of Utah, a member of the committee, and these were given study today by members of the committee as well as other senators and by some members of the houRe.

A suggestion thgt the Anglo Japanese pact be revoed has gone to London and^ Tokyo. Possible controversies over the Pacific inlands alone, exclusive of the Hawaiian group and Yap, would come under the provisions of the new agreement.

It l^ possible, however, that all of these' questions may come simultaneouslyftto 'the point of a decision. By the American delegates the project is reatded as establishing neither an, aitflrnce nor an entente, but merely as riHNying to the Pacific islands the prinjaple. of the 30-odd Bryan peace troaKfc to which the United States ghreat&is a party.

HARRISON RAPS fi MAJORITY PARTY ;n Wushington, Doc. 7.?The Ropubli-: in can party's leadership from President tie Harding down was assailed in a a speech in the senate today by Senart tor Harrison (Democrat) of Mississ sippi. who declared Mr. Harding was is doing the "very things for which he a- as a senator had denounced President a Wilson." >d The president's message to con-| ie gross yesterday, he added, constituted an appeal to partisonship and a warnre ing to Republicans to disavow theii ic allegiance to the "bloc" organization, ie Mr. Harrison attacked the senate m Republican leaders, saying they had ir "shifted and hopped until none of u> ;r know where or when or why." :h Secretary Mellon also was dcnouncle od as seeking, in his annual report of ie the treasury department, to "help ie along" the ideas of President Harding i. with respect "to relieving the rich" | i- of heavy taxation. The Mississippi v. senator added he was "pained ' to see > the regular session of congress start ' 'd off so inauspiciously, saying that with ii. cne appeal 01 me president lor a p irtisan lineup," it was apparent thai . h the policy of "abandonment" which , ts characterized the extra session \\\ aid y be continued. When Mr. Wilson opposed or u*- red ( legislation, Mr. Harrison contin: od , ,, *- the then Senator Harding described ^ ie him as a "dictator and an autocrat,' ; g and when Mr. Wilson issued his ap- ( 's peal in 1918 for the election of a Democratic congress, Mr. Harding;! * was equally bitter in his denounce-1 u' ment. n> "Yet we have the spectacle," he I ie said, "of the president coming here! , !(> ?:r>d making a speech against'the m1 ^ u" dier bonus, a thing unprecedented. n Then yesterday he came here and ap j ie pealed to the agricultural group to ? line up, to get behind the party bunner." j rc He added, however, that it might | s* have been that the president was call- j v- ing for the Republican senators to j ( line up and retain the seat of Sena-1 j 8 tor Newberry of Michigan, now under J !S* contest by Henry Ford in connection , s* with the 1918 election, as a matter I j 111 of party policy. This ' statement -precipitated a de-|m bate on the Newberry case which is to y* be decided next month, in which half il' a dozen senators participated. The discussion also involved the league of , nations. i R? Mr. Harrison, however, returned to u* a discussion of the president's message with the remark that the New )n sage with the remark that the New- . )e berry case was "so nauseating that I do not want to hook it up with the 10 league of nations." Continuing, he said he was confile dent there had been a misprint in ( the president's message where Mr. 'l> Harding had expressed appreciation 10 of the "signal achievements" of the 1 extra session. What the president ie meant, he added, was, probably, "single" achievement, for otherwise the message appeared "most contradic tory and conflicting." The action of the house in fixing 50 per cent surtax rate in the revenue bill, he declared, constituted a n" "plain repudiation" of the executive's s? stand. It was apparent, he added, that the house action had "riled the president considerably." ly "But I insist," he said, "that the : J progressives in the house had c ur;*.ge and they told the president where to get off." is Recommend Increase In Cadet Corps ie r Washington.

MEXICANS SEIZE AMERICAN BOAT Washington, Dec. 7.?The American fishing boat Mable, of Los Angeles was seized early* this week about 5 miles off the Mexican coast by a vessel of the Mexican patrol and another of American registry but manned by Mexican soldiers, the state department was advised today l\v American Consul Burdette of Ensenda, Mexico.
