"Russia Will Right Herself," Says Writer to London Newspaper 

LONDON, Dec. 5. The situation In Russia is unique in history, according to the Petrograd corresondent of the Morning Post Wilting Saturday, but it is not yet advisable to attempt to raise the curtain upon the mysteries of the tragic-comic drama.

Some force which is above or beyond all tfcgj contending parties is putting the spokes into the wheels of all of them." The correspondent instances the various interferences with the admin istration without, however, elucidating his suggestion. (ALE AT OLD L FARM BRINGS $ 000 The sale conducted by Auctioneer T.

TEN DIVISIONS USED (By Associated Press) ITALIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS IN NORTHERN ITALY, Tuesday Dec. 4 Great forces of men and guns have been massed by the Austrians and Germans In the Asiago section, ac cording to reports reaching here to night and resumption of the offensive Is expected Tbe reports indicate that tbe enemy is employing ten divisions of troops. Austria Hungary, with whom tbe United States is on the eve of a de claration of war as the principal ally of Germany, Is taking the lead In new attempt to break through tbepres- ent Italian front. Falling to pierce the Piave river line in many attempts and flung back from the mountain passes between tbe Piave and the Brenta by the dogged Italian resistance, the Austrians have turned further westward to the Tren tino region northwest of Asiago and today are reported beginning an at tack In force on the Sette Comuni plateau.

The Brit ish salient there, however, is still a menace to the security of the German lines nortn and south of Cambrai and tbe German artillery bombardment is probably but -the prelude to further desperate efforts to wipe out the gains made by General Byng's troops. British artillery yesterday broke up enemy troop concentrations east of Gouzeaucourt and near Moeuvre-s, on the southern and northern legs of the i salient, respectively, and the Germans violently shelled the region of La Vac querie, the center of much of the fight ing activity of the past few days. That the Germaa purpose may have been to break through into the Somme region as well as to blot out tbe Cam brai salient Is indicated in despatches from the front. But the efforts hav been futile and caused s'ich losses thr.f the let-up in the fighting activity prob ably is due to tbe necessity for re forming the attacking forces. AUSTRIANS TO BE WATCHES WASHINGTON. D C.
