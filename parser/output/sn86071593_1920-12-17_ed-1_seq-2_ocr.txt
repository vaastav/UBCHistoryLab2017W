Viscount Ishii officially declared nt Go nova that Japan cannot consent to any limitation or tier expenditures on arma ment as long as then; are other nations outside the league of nations and not subject to such limitations, "especially one certain great power.' This puts sipiarely up to the L niton States. The assembly had made considerable headway. The members seemed almost unanimously in favor of a projxisal to limit military and naval programs for the years 1922 and 1923 to expenditures not in excess of those contemplated for 1921. The British delegation was en thusiastic. Then Japan, though Brit ain's ally, demurred, serving notice that as long as the United States continues in creasing its armament, she feels obliged to do the same thing in self-defense. Here is the whole problem in a nut shell. Every nation increasing its army and navy has always argued the same way. In most cases nations have doubt less been sincere about it. There is no need to question Japan's sincerity in this case. She is simply doing what America would do in her position. The situation puts the United States in an embarrasing spotlight. This coun try has always advocated the limitation of armament at international peace gatherings, and severely criticised ,(Jer: many before the war because the latter would not agree. Now it is the United States that is placed in the position of preventing a start toward lessening the biggest load now piled on the world's bark, and a load that is coming to weigh almost ns grievously on our na tion as on those lesvS wealthy. It is not necessary for America to be in the league of nations in order to co operate in this great reform. The league lias invited the United States to par ticipate independently in tlie disarma ment discussions. President Wilson has refused, no doubt from a sense of delicacy that is natural enough in the circum stances. But as matters stand, should any sense of delicacy be allowed to in terfere with the launching of a reform of which the big majority of Americans have always approved and approve to day According to the Rutland News a Vermont fur dealer tells the following story of one of his patrons and a fur lined overcoat : "The coat, lined with mink, in 191.,, cost ... After wearing it two years the owner sold the mink lining for Sl. 00 and replaced it with nutria at a cost of .$l."t0. Two years later, in 1917, he had the nutria lining removed and sold it for $2T). A musk rat lining va then put in at a cost of $."), which, in 1!)19, was in turn removed and sold for $300. The original purchaser still has the shell." He must be in a quandary what f line it with next time. 0 Dad's Day ID ppjA Nonce -me

The Rutland Herald makes assertion that "not one-tenth of the men who at tack the present school law know what that law actually is." That seems an absolutely safe wager. Let's all go to school again and learn the school law. Free Press. Quite right. But also study the rulings on the law by Hillegas. lid you know that a graduate of the best high school, academy, etc., in Ver mont cannot get a certificate to teach even In a rural school?

Within the past few months there have been outbreaks of .smallpox in Vermont which have caused some concern and now Brandon has a few cases. Smallpox is one of the most loathsome diseases known and in the great majority of cases it is unnecessary. There was a time when this disease would sweep whole communi ties, almost whole countries, and naturally people stood in great dread of it. Then science came to the aid of humans and a way to prevent it was discovered. Vac cination is open to all, rich and poor alike, and vaccination is a safeguard against .smalljox. With it very evident that this disease is threatening, the wise course is for persons to have their children vaccin ated and to renew their own vaccinations if it has been a long period of years since they underwent this comparatively simple "operation."

PAPE. Last Satidday nite I was laying on the setting room floor feeling thanktill I dident haff to do eny lessins, and pop sed, We sleep too mutch, thats wats the matter with the human race. My goodniss, youre not mad at the hole race, are you? sed ma, and pop sed, Ive bin reeding a few things that Edison has to say about oversleeping, and he's rite, no ixcuse for it. Edison only sleeps about 4 hours a day and look at the wonderfill We waste half our life in bed and there's things he does. If he's that wonderfill with ony 4 hours sleep jest think how wonderfill he would be if he slept his full 8 hours, sed ma. That.s a womans argewment, sed pop, I bleeve 111 try it myself, I dont say I could get along on 4 hours sleeps, but I bet I could in 0.

Re gardless of the provisions of the decree now being awaited, either in relation to the expenditures of the fund itself or the allowance of the fees asked for, the fact remains that these lawyers hope, even if they do not expect, to be gener ously paid for the time which they have into ine case. mac is.oi course their right, and The Meddler has no quar rel with them so long as they admit that they took hold of the case purely as a business proposition. If, however, in the event of a favorable decree, either Mr. Barber or Mr. Hughes should attempt to arrogate to himself a public spirited motive. The Meddler would be constrained to ioint out that the plan which they knowingly frustrated by stepping into the case contemplated the accomplish ment of all they hope to accomplish with out taking a penny from the Thompson fund income. Peer hunters in this part of Vermont will be glad to know that State Com missioner Leavens is to ask for a repeal of the law which permits the shooting of doe, for so far as The Meddler can ascertain then1 is a general feeling among! sportsmen that the season under present conditions amounts to a slaughter in which they find little pride in participat ing. With does and fawns protected and the open time fixed in the early part of November, there wi'l be plenty of op portunity for the real hunters and like wise something like a chance for the deer themselves. It is almost needless to say that the destruction of the temporary bridge across the Connecticut opposite this town, com ing as it did in the height of the holi day shopping season, means a loss con siderably larger than can b gauged by the cost of the stricture itself. Local trade is bound to suffer by reason of this sudden break in the main traffic route from southeastern New IIamishire and adjoining portions of Massachusetts, but no doubt the philosophical thing to do is to be thankful it didn't come any sooner and that there was no loss of life connected with it. With this thoroughfare out of com mission twice within less than a year, the importance of a hard-surface highway southward on this side of the river is forcibly brought to mind. It is sincerely to be hoped that State Highway Oommis-! Today's Events Twenty-five years ago today President Cleveland sent to congress his memorable message on Venezuela.

Now if the operators will kindly strike, the old-timers might get a few days rest from the greatest pest of modern civilization unnecessary talk over the telephone. The telephone, prop erly used, is a great and useful institution, but the excessive load of trivial twaddle which the telephone wires have to carry is about as valuable as the beating of a tom-tom by a Fiji Island savage. - 5a man iiuijiiiiii.
