Secretary Gage in a special report makes it perfectly clear that the Span ish Government has been trusting to the United States doing police duty for it oft Cuban shores. The Secretary declares unequivocally that had Spain made half an effort she could have pa trolled the entire shore line of Cuba, i and have prevented a single landing. She has not done this, but has taken her siesta with intermingle grumbling at the United States, because it did not wholly prevent filibustering expedi tions. In two years and a half, says the Secretary, this Government has been co vigilant that only six American Vessels aggregating so small capacity as 1,331 tons, are alleged to have suc cessfully landed expeditions from the United States. These six vessels, with a single exception, have been tugs or i small pilot boats, incapable of carrying large bodies of men or large quantities of arms and ammunition. Three foreign ships with a capacity of 1.773 tons have, it is alleged, slipped through Spanish fingers and made suc cessful filibustering landings. The crews of those ships were listed by the Consuls of their nations in our ports, and the Secretary' suggests that ordi nary vigilance on the part of the Span ish officers in the United States should have prompted them to notify these Consuls of the alleged illegality of the expeditions of the foreign ships. The point made in this relation is that if these three foreign ships cleared without knowledge of the illegal char- j acter of their enterprise coming to the ; United States officials, so it must be clear that the foreign Consuls were also ignorant of the true purpose of clearance. On the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, says the Secretary. In 1885 there were no less than 13,585 vessels of various kinds of American tonnage and fit for j lilibustering purposes, yet only six out Of the entire lot escaped our watchful- ■ ness. The Secretary" is right in say- | ing that this fart demonstrates the j absurdity of the charge that the ! American nation has not been diligent in preserving the neutrality laws from invasion. It seems that in doing menial work for the lazy Dons resting in ease in their cabins off Moro, we have had eight revenue cutters with 317 men, the boats armed with 18 guns, coast cruising 78,888 miles in 169 months, policing the shores of the Atlantic and the Gulf in honest endeavor to pre vent filibustering expeditions reaching Cuba from our sea coast. This force captured seven vessels and 115 men. brought up two expeditions and kept under surveillance thirteen other ves sels, ar«d from time to time we had other revenue cutters engaged in simi lar work temporarily. Here, then, we have patrolled a coast line of .">,470 miles with diligence. The 2.200 ndles of Cuban coast if patrolled with halt as. much sincerity by Span ish cruisers, would not have witnessed, in the opinion of the Secretary, the landing of a single cartridge or man il legally. But the fact is, that out of sixty alleged unlawful expeditions, Spain, with all her l>oasted naval strength, has stopped but four expedi tions. The Secretary points out that the La rauda openly and for two days landed her contraband of war with full knowl edge of the Spanish naval officers, who made no attempt to prevent the pro ceeding. We are of the opinion that the Secretary might well have added to his charge of responsibility for this landing, upon Spain, the farther charge that the Spanish officials did not wish to prevent the landing from the La rauda, because they wished to use the lncident to inflame the Spanish the more against the United States. It was not so much from fear for their pre cious hides, nor because of the slug gishness of the Latin blood in their veins, that they took no action, but rather for a sinister and dishonorable purpose. The Secretary shows that in ali the United States frustrated twenty-eight filibustering expeditions through the activity of our revenue service; five were headed off by our navy; two were wrecked; one was driven back by storm; one failed from other causes, and one related to violation of the British Enlistment Act. Only four ex peditions were frustrated by Spain. Of the seventeen successful cases of filibustering, the Secretary points out that one partial success was due to weakness of the Spanish patrol on the Cuban coast; in another the Spanish officials have exonerated the Treasury Department: in another the United agreement among the Spanish officials as to material facts; in three cans wreck rendered procedure against the boats impracticable; in five cases the principal offenders have been convicted and Sentenced; one case is wholly with in British jurisdiction. In three cases the vessels have been libeled for con fiscation; in one other the ship's offi cers have been indicted; in anotht r a principal la now a prisoner: in one case the libel has !>een di&missed. and In two cases the facts are under lnvosti lt is submitted that this is a splendid showing. We have given it so much of repetitive n dice because it is essen tial that the public mind shall be Catty bat pasted with the fact that the United s:a!(s Government has been engaged in no child's play, has not evaded any duty, has not winked at any violation of the neutiaiity laws, nor has It proved untrue to the obligations of its treaty with Spain. The fact is, we have been playing the honorable part, and at the expense of millions of dollars; we have been doing j dirty work for Spain, while her olive- \ skinned officials have lolled in their cab ins. This is no exaggeration. With her j naval and marine strength Spain could have thrown a chain of guard ships i about the entire Cuban coast, and out- Side of that line have kept her swift | cruisers in sight of one another circum venting the island had she wished. This enormous cost has been incurred in faithful discharge of duty to Spain, while she has been negligent of her obligations, and the American people ■ have been denied expenditure of small ; sums for needed rjfver and harbor im provements and other necessary pub lic works. Our Govt rnment has under the cir- Icnmstances been too vigilant. The las jsltude and neglect of Spain justified us ; long ago In refusing to take extraor dinary precautions, for our treaty re j quires the Spanish Government to do j its full part. We repeat the convic tion already announced, that the Span i ish have not desired to be vigilant in ; these matters. The scheme of ihe ex termination of Cubans worked out bet \ ter by permitting the Islanders to have j Just enough aid to keep alive their | hopes, and thus enable the desolation lof the land to be more effectually ac ! complished, and the Spanish officers to ; tine their pockets with plunder. That ' the whole course of Weyler justifies this conclusion we believe careful and impartial digestion of the facts dis closes. GERMANY AND AMERICA. j Assuming that the accounts of Ger ;man ill-feeling towards the United States are verity, the matter becomes amusing when we are told that Ger • man officials declare that America !must be disciplined and punished for 'her interference in the Haytian mat ter. It is said also that the Emperor 1 himself some time ago declared that j the United States would have to be j taught manners, while now German 'statesmen roar that Germany must make ready to take the starch out of ; America. All this is ludicrous. That we inter fered in the Haytian matter is news, [indeed. Ail that our country did in j that instance was to solicit President Sum to release Herr Leuders, with ; which request he complied. It is to the common mortal clear that this was a friendly act. It is conceivable, how jever, that Germany is angered because j Leuders was not kept in prison to give the Emperor excuse for blowing a hole ithrough the little insular Republic. Evidently the jingo Germans, among whom the Emperor is to be rated, are I desirous for trouble with the United ; States. It Will be difficult for them to bring about a conflict, however. There Its no cause for quarreling between the 'two nations: nor is there likely to be, ;except Germany herself furnishes it. The latest attack by Germany upon i American pork and pork products can ! hardly be worried into a difficulty in volving unfriendly relations. If the Germans do not wish to use American pork there is no power to compel them. We ask only the same rights in com | mercial dealing that are accorded to ■ other foreign countries. Until there is I unfriendly discrimination then, Amer jica will smile and preserve the peace, 'despite the glowering of the German ! sensationalists. The news is that China has acceded to German pressure, and yielded up Kaichou Bay and so much of the mainland as is necessary for occupancy of the waters, the earlier story of ces sion of Sam Suh Inlet being denied. If the cession of the bay has been made, then we have on the historic page of the century' record of one of the most shameless conquests over a helpless people by a great military Power to which the world's annals bear any testimony. That this conquest by Ger many will inspire other Powers to seize upon parts of China's domain is not Impossible; nay. it is not improbable. The "Record-Union" foreshadowed such a possibility the other day, and now the dispatches speak of such in tentions as already in mind in the English Cabinet, and as contemplated by Russia also. Our forecast then, that before the close of the century coast China may be divided up and parceled out among the great European Pow ers, may turn out to have been pro phetic. In that case, what will be the situation of the United States? Does not the bare suggestion of such exten sion of European power In the Orient emphasize the necessity for acquiring Hawaii, that these predatory nations ■ t esiablish themselves upon our natural outposts? The hint that the river and harbor bill may fail at this session has pro duced a sensation in Milwaukee news l aj>er circles at least, lest work upon the harbor of refuge at that place shall in i ds queue be suspended.-—Los Angeles Herald. Yes; it has taken so many millions of the National treasury, you see, to do the menial work of Spain In enforcing neu | trallty laws which she could have ren- Ai r< d unnecessary if she had possessed j the courage to lash her lazy officials out ' 15 ivai.a harbor and make them patrol Ith Cuban coast.

SACRAMENTO DAILY RECOBD-UyiOX. MONDAY. DECEMBER 13. 1897. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL EXPRESSION. State and Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living News Interest. Redding Free Press: The President's message is an able, .conservative doc ument. After reading it the American people will com lude that our common country is sure to enjoy peace and prosperity while he is at the helm of state. He does not believe in rushing blindly into foreign entanglements, yet he shows by his message that he dignity and honor of our great coun try >\iil be preserved at all hazards. The President dwells upon the evils of our present monetary system-, and makes some wise suggestions to pro tect the Government against future bond issues. He says: "When receipts are sufficient to pay expenses it is recommended that when any United State:; notes are redeemed in gold such notes be kept and set aside and only paid out in exchange for gold. The Government should be relieved of the responsibility of providing all the gold required for exchanges and export. Na tional banks should be required to re deem their notes in gold." Altogether the message will meet the approval of the American people. 

BELLIGERENCY RECOGNITION. Oakland Enquirer: Upon first state ment, a proposition to recognize the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents looks wonderfully taking. It seems to be a proposal to pay a proper tribute to the bravery of the insurgents with out cost to ourselves. The idea of the belligerency advocates is to give the Cubans cur moral support, which might help them to sell their bonds. But on close examination, such as President McKinley gives it in his message, it is discovered that the inside of this bel ligerency proposition is different from its outside. To declare the insurgents belligerents would give the Spaniards the right to search our ships when not protected by the shelter of our own ports and would make it considerably more difficult for the Cubans to get arms and ammunition. It would also enable the Spaniards to disavow re sponsibility for the destruction of mill ions of American property in Cuba. 

IMPORTED VINES. Fresno Republican: The Fanners' Club is advocating a wise action on the part of the Supervisors when it asks for the passage of an ordinance pro | hibiting the importation of grape : vines, rooted or in cuttings, into Fresno from any other county in the State. The alarming fact that the Anaheim disease, which practically destroyed the yin- yuus of some of the southern counties a few years ago. has appeared in h- northern part of the State, is sufficient cause for the proposed ac tion. There should be no unnecessary . delay in the matter, as the planting season is near at hand, and the plant ing of a single diseased vine might re sult in giving the plague a foothold. NOT HEARD FROM. Alameda Encinal: Those thirteen for eign nations whose representatives made protests against certain features | of the Dingley bill during its considera tion by Congress have not yet made good theSr ••bluff" to exclude American products. On the contrary, their pur chases from us have increased 25 per cent. s:nce the enactment of the Ding ley law, while that measure has been j followed by a reduction of 2o per cent. | in our importation from those countries. I >KMOCRATIC VIEW. Los Angeles Herald: A chief recom j mendation in the financial part of the President's message is that gold shall be paid only for greenbacks and that I greenbacks shall be paid only for gold. If the Treasury Department can do ■ this, why could not Secretary Carlisle have exercised his discretion and paid out silver "coin" instead of gold, and j thus have stopped the drain on the i Treasury reserve that necessitated the ! issue of bonds? Under the President's proposal a bond issue would be necessary for the pur pose of redeeming the greenbacks in gold. There are $346,000,000 in green backs in circulation. The recommenda tion—if it is made —will be recognized as a part of the conspiracy to fasten still more firmly about the necks of the American people the yellow shackles of the single gold standard. THE 

IONE OUTRAGES. Stockton Record: If there is another State in the American Union that has a Governor who would not have taken prompt and effective measures to in vestigate such outrages as are charged against the management of the lone School, we do not know what State it is. Nor do we believe there is another \ Executive among the forty-five who would be so indifferent, so callous, so derelict in a matter involving the treat meat of helpless children. It is an out rage against the l>oys there confined, a disgrace to the State, a humiliation to all the people in the commonwealth. There is evidently a way to reach and punish every accuser, every witness whose evidence is material in establish ing the truth of the charges, and there is a way to reach O'Brien, if the Gov ernor, who created him, so desires. REMARKABLE Santa Rosa Republican: It is rather remarkable that anybody would stand up before a Santa Rosa audience and declare that the wages of laborers in the United States are not being in creased, when the dispatches of al most every day tell of thousands who are getting better wages. All over the Eastern and Central States factory and i railroad employes and miners are re ceiving better returns for their work than came to them a year ago, and thousands are now employed that were In enforced idleness then. The tele grams taat tell of these advances in compensation are not falsehoods. THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. San Jose Herald: Spalding, the em bezzling Chicago banker, has been con victed. Under the indeterminate sen system that has been adopted in Illinois, he may serve a sentence of any where from one to fifteen years, ac cording to the judgment of the Board of PrJSon Commissioners. The idea of such a sentence is to punish or rather discipline a prisoner so long as may be necessary to make a worthy member of society of him and no longer. When he is fit for freedom he is to have MS release. To make the system scientific the sentence should be truly indeterminate, that rs. there ghould be neither maximum nbr mini mum limit SACRAM ENTO'S EXAMPLE. Colusa Sun: Sacramento County has }USt Voted six to one in favor of issuing bonds in $75,000 to construct a model road from Folsom to Sacramento. The crushed rock will be furnished free by the State. No people can invest money to so good advantage as in building [good roada in the right place. It teal most impossible to build a good road by the piece-meal plan that the ordinary machinery of county government af fords, and a bond issue is too often followed by incompetency or worse, so that on the whole the question of good roads is one of great difficulty. It is not the manner of building so much as the management of the financial end of the business. Where the scattering plan must obtain there must of necessi ty be more or less of bad management on the lines. The officer In charge must try to please all his constituents, and this leads to such a scattering of the energy as to accomplish nothing In any one place; this even where it is in the hands of competent men. but ex perience shows that more than half the time the work is in very incompe tent hands. And the system is to blame. The town of Colusa struck out in the right direction years ago when it issued bonds to build a road across the trough, but $20,009 was not enough money. We could not have done with out that road. No one in Colusa has regretted the taxes paid on that ac count. BAR AND PULPIT. Grass Valley Union: A Santa Barbara preacher has deserted the pulpit for the bar. He argues that "there is a Wider field for doing good in law and poli tics." A few months' experience in his new cailing will probably convince the gentleman that the man who goes into law and politics in these days simply for the purpose of "doing good" has undertaken a task more difficult than pointing out the path to eternal salva tion. SACRAMENTO IN THE VAN. Nevada City Herald: Sacramento County has put herself In the van of the movement for good.roads by voting to issue bonds for the construction of the Folsom boulevard. CUBAN INDEPENDENCE. Marysville Appeal: There has been some little criticism of the sturdy op position of the Cuban patriots to Span ish overtures in the direction of au tonomy. It is manifest that the Cu bans are fully determined to accept nothing short of absolute independence. They undoubtedly have the courage of their convictions, and, while they may occasionally be given to intemperate expressions, they, on the whole, deserve and possess the sympathy and support of the American people. It has been said that autonomy would be letter than the present desperate struggle waged to the bitter end, and that in refusing autonomy the Cubans run the risk of losing all. This opin ion seems to be based upon the old adage that a half loaf is better than no bread. We have no sympathy with this view of the case. A half loaf may be worse than no bread. This is especial ly true when in accepting a half loaf, one stultifies a principle and sacrifices self-respect. It is also true when in ac cepting a half loaf, one. condones the unrighteous withholding of the other half. It is equally true when the half loaf accepted contains a foreign sub stance, poisonous or otherwise injuri ous, thereby defeating the very pur pose for which the bread is sought. 

CASSIMIR BADENI. Austrian Premier, Who Has Been the Center of Much Trouble. The troubles in the lower house of the Austrian Parliament have attract ed world-wide attention. Count Cas simir Badeni, the Austrian Prime Min ister, has been the center of much of the troubles. He is a Pole and has won his way from among the lowly to the highest in State affairs of Eu rope. The late King of Poland made a Count of him just two years before Cassimir was born. His father had not enough money to display the new title and the child when he came had black enough prospects. Fortunately he came into the possession of a legacy which enabled him to have the best of edu cational facilities. He is now a wealthy man, being worth millions, as is also his brother. Though a great statesman, he is jovial and is counted a wit. He has a ferocious mustache, whlcb bejftee his genial disposition. He is exceedingly bald. His income is al most unlimited, and he spends it free ly. He is very popular. Western Horse Trade. "I've got a job hauling lumber," he said, "and I haven't got quite team enough. Only," he added, "don't give me anything that can't true," (that is, technically, good to pull,) "because I can get along with what I've got, but if I can get a horse to mate this big one of mine I can do a good deal bet ter." The ranchman showed him a good-sized horse, and asked him how that would suit him. "He'd do all right," said the teamster, after looking him over, "if he's true; will he pull?" "Pull!" said the other, "it would do your heart good to see him pull!" and the trade was made, the smaller horse turned over, together with a few dol lars in money, to "boot," or difference in value, to the ranchman, and the new acquisition harnessed up in his place and driven off. In about twenty minutes the man was back, this time in a towering rage. "Forgot Something?" blandly inquired the ranchman. "No, sir," roared the teamster; "I'm here to give you a thumping for doin' me up like this. The very first hill I come to that horse f got from you quit me. wouldn't begin to take hold with nothin' but the wagon behind him—just threw his head over the other horse and kicked. You've busted up my winter's job and now you've got to take your medicine." "Hold on," said the ranchman, cool ly. "You asked me if the horse would pull, and what I said was. it would do your heart good to see him pull, and wouldn't it?" On reflection the team ster had to admit that this was so, and that he had been, as he allowed, fairly beat. They exchanged again, however, according to the writer's in formation, and parted good friends- Longman's Magazine.

The late Professor Jowett, during: his connection with BalHbl College, had oc casion to visit .some of the farms be longing to the college near the Scottish borders. One of the leading tenants was deputed to take the professor around. A long tramp they had, in the course of which Jow ett uttered not a word, while the farmer was too much stricken with awe to venture a remark. But when the walk was almost done the professor was roused to speech. Looking over a stone wall, over a good ly held of vivid green, he abruptly said: "Fine potatoes." Quota the farmer: "Yon's turmets." Not a word more was spoken between them. One of the Ingalis girls, who is very proud of her father, recently attended a se<n"ls-public dance. In the course of the evening she was approached by an Atchison young man. the son of a gi >- eery keeper, who had known her from Infancy, though not intimately. He asked her for a dance, when she re plied, as she drew back a little super ciliously: "I think you are the son of our grocery-keeper, but I infer that you do not know me. I am the daugh ter of the Hon. John J. Ingalis." ' In galis? Ingalis?" musingly inquired the young grocery - UMt. "Where have 1 heard that name before? Oh. yes, I re member now. Your father was the man who reported the Corbett-Fitzsim mons prize light." Pr. Thompson, the famous master of Trinity College, Cambridge, is regarded chiefly as the sayer of sharp, witty and often bitter epfgrams. He said of Ely, where, as professor of Greek, he held a canonry: "The place is so damp that even my sermons won't keep dry there," and at a college meeting, where Bjfttne of the young fellows were treating with very little respect the opinions of some of their seniors, he said: "None of us Is quite infallible, not even the young est." Of an amiable and excellent scholar he said: "The d>me that he spends on the neglect of his duties he wastes on the adornment of his per son;" and of an eminent professor, whose first lecture he attended: "I lit tle thought that we should so soon have cause to regret his predecessor. Profes sor ." Dining Abroad. An amusing: account of a dinner in Budapest is given in "What to Eat" tor November. An American physician was invited to dine at the house of a prominent journalist. He was in troduced to an Austrian who, the bust whispered proudly, spoke English flu ently. 'I saw that Mr. Febevary was not at has case, for his English and reputa tion were at stake," says the doctor. "Our Magyar friends immediately wished us to speak English to each other, and a circle was formed around us, as if we were two prize fighters ready for the fray. I said: " How do you do, Mr. Febevary?' " 'Most veil.' he answered bravely. " 'Where did you study English?' " 'In myself,' he said with great ef fort." The young woman the doctor took out to dinner had come in from the country especially to meet him. She was much disappointed to find the gen tleman from America was white. She plied him with all manner of questions. Dinner began with chicken soup, "and," continues the narrator, "of course my neighbor asked: " Did we eat soup in America?' " "Next came roa,=t goose that melted upon the lips like butter; green peas were the wheels of its chariot. " 'Did we have geese." asked my D ighbor. " 'Plenty of them,' I said. " Were they as good as those in Hungary?' "I wanted to say much better, be cause the kind I meant asked no ques tions; but I controlled myself and said instead that they couldn't compare with Hungarian geese. Spring chicken, fried in olive oil—the chicken better than the goose—was the third course. " "Did we have chickens?' queried my interlocutor, 'and what did we do with them?' " That depended upon their age,' I said. Dessert, which has no namesake this side of the Atlantic, followed. Fruit and wine, the ladies also partak ing of the latter, closed the dinner, but not tht mouth of my inquisitive neigh bor. " Did the girls dress differently from the boys? Did we have bathrooms?' " 'Yes, and we took a bath, once in a while.' " How large a city was America?' " 'Considerably larger than Budapest.' "At this point our hostess rising af forded me a blessed release from the witness stand. The gentlemen were going to the coffee house to read the pa pea*?, and the ladies would follow in an hour, I was told. Mr. Feh. vary kept at a safe distance from me all the time. I saw him handling a pocket diction ary, ard knew he was getting loaded with something, for he looked very stu dious _nd his lips were moving inces santly. At last he seemed to have it, for a look of triumph came over his face. We were ready to go. The ser vants Bit stood in a row, waiting for a foe. Mr. Fehevary couldn't go to the coffee house — he was too busy—but he followed me to the door, and in hear in-,- of all the Estetys, the whole news paper staff and the servants! —male and female— he said triumphantly, as he shook my hand: " T been enthused to make your gon nections.'
