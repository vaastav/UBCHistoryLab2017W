A DECREASE IN TONNAGE tin: car siintT.f;i: am lack of POWIIlt CUT DOWN TRAFFIC. Emplnyen of II on da Who Are Aver? to the Pension Plan-General ami l'erionnl Hallway News. Contrary to expectations, the train rec ords show a falling off in loaded ear move ment, not for want of freight to move, but due to a more pronounced car shortage and the fact thit many locomotives are in the shops and out of service temporarily. Had the Pennsylvania, the Dig Four, the Lake Erie &, Western, the Monon and the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton plenty of cars and power to move them promptly business would be at its maximum. At every station there are delayed freights awaiting cars to carry them. While there la but little grain moving, in other lines of traffic business is heavy beyond all preced ents, and general freight agents state that as soon as one lot of delayed freights Is cleared up another puts in an appearance, and It seems impossible to make much headway. At Eastern points cars are be ing unloaded very slowly, and Western lines now refuse to let their cars leave their own lines. Coupled with the car shortage is a scarcity of locomotives, de spite the fact that most of the lines named have considerably increased their power in the last twelve months. West-bound business Is unusually heavy, and a con siderable per cent, of it is delayed freights, that wanted for the holiday trade, and there is much complaining over the matter; but the principal demand is for coal, lum ber, live stock and refrigerator cars, the latter being used more extensively in mov rig fruits and vegetables, iiox cars are being utilized to an extent never before known in handling the lines of freight usually carried on flat and gondola cars. Weather conditions the latter part of the week were not so favorable to traffic, but as yet there has been but little reduction of the tonnage of locomotives, and this will be over as soon as the weather mod erates. One thing is noticeable: the In dianapolis lines are carrying business at full rates. The train records show that there were received and forwarded at In dianapolis in the week ended Dec. 14 a total of 27.440 cars, 21,413 being loaded, against 21,031 in the corresponding week of ILM), and against 21,170 in 1.V.J9 and 21. 172 In l!ls. From the latter statement it will be seen that more loaded cars were handled this year than in either of the three preceding ones, and at least 5 per cent, more tonnage per car. The following table shows the number of cars handled at this point for the week ended Dec. 14 and for the corresponding weeks of l'ju and 1S'J9: Name of Road. 10)1. 1900. 1S00. C. I.

Employes of the Michigan Central, after prolonged consideration, have voted down the pension proposition. The proposition did not come from the officers of the road, but was favored by several connected with the line, and when the matter was brought before a large committee they could not agree and on its recommendation the en tire question has been dropped. Several months ago employes of the Chicago, Mil waukee & St. I'aul received a proposi tion ' from the managers of the road for the formation of a pension deartment. The Milwaukee plan was put to vote of the employes and defeated. The position of the men of that system was that they did not care to provide a pension for them selves out of their own pockets, and it would appear from the actions of the em ployes of these two roads that the men will not favor any pension plan for em nloves. even if it only involved partial i support by the employes. The pension plans of the Pennsylvania, the Chicago A; Northwestern and the Illinois Central are entirely corporation affairs, the fund be ing maintained und the pensions paid out of money set aside for the purpose, and employes of these roads profess themselves satisfied with the workings of their pen sion system. The charge that the pension plan is only a scheme to get rid of men after they have reached certain ages has not been approved. The age at which men will be retired Is figured by the manager at about the time employes have served their usefulness in any capacity, and, in stead of discharging them, they will be pensioned.

Rock Island ft Pacific, has been appointed assistant passenger agent, with headquar ters at Des Moines, succeeding F. H. Iord. Master Mechanic McKee, of the Wabash, says th re i no foundation for the report that thir new heavy freight engines are not giving satisfaction. They are hauling larger trains and making better time than any oth r locomotives the company owns. The Lackawanna has prepared plans for an expenditure of $.5. ooo.mM at Newark, X. J.

Vanderbilt attended the meeting of officials of his several railroad interests h. Id in New York last wo-k, and thtre is excellent authority for stating that no plan of proprietary lines or financial readjust ment wa even broached, putting at rest all rumors of that character. The introd'iction of heavy locomotives and lAi.o") pounds capacity cars with a io id ef tlfty tons is proving a crucial test on railroad J tints, and engine rs on the f:;st trains ? iy th;it no i dnt yet introduced is capable of witltanding the strain and pr vetiti' g the tracks getting rough. The proposition of the Pennsylvania to xi nd t '-me SI ).,Mt on tunnels in N" w Yor anl JIu.om.o-0 on other improvements illustrates its nrat financial Mrength as well as its prugn slvu policy, and that its promoters are determined to maintain its position as the most powerful railroad com pany In the country. The traffic managers of the Mahoning Valley Steel Company announce that they will follow the policy pursued by the Car negie Steel Company and build an inde pendent fine from New Castle to Youngs town and Lake Erie, the line to be built entirely by managers of the big steel in dustries of the two valleys. An interesting little booklet, entitled "The Four Track News," has been issued by the New York Central & Hudson River. The work is designed as an auxiliary to the New York Central's four-track series. It contains timely notes of travel and Inter esting information relating to the develop ment of transportation in the twentieth century. An official of the Wabash says that the road is in good physical condition, and the amount of equipment now owned is ample for present requirement: that tho company needs to expend considerable money in adding more side tracks, in reducing grades and improving stations, and in preparation for the larger business expected from the connection with Pittsburg. For the year ending Dec. 31. the last two weeks estimated, the Lake Erie & Western has earned, gross, $4,370,335, an increase over last year of $s5.555; net. $1,157.573. a de crease of $i2.345. The decrease in net earn ings is due to the large expenditures in the way of improvements to the property, which have been paid out of the gross earn ings. Pruce Jeffries, who has been agent for the Continental fast freight line in Terre Haute for six years, has been appointed traveling passenger agent of the Evansville St Terre Haute and the Chicago & Eastern Illinois (the Evansville route) for the Southeastern States, with headquarters at Atlanta, Ga. He is a brother of Frank Jef fries, general passenger and freight agent of the Evansville & Terre Haute. E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa Fe. in giving his views of the present railroad situation, said the rate situation is not sat isfactory, although perhaps no worse than It has been most of the time for the last twenty-five years. For some time after the presidents' agreement was promulgated rates were well maintained, but this did not last very long. Spasmodic efforts have been made from time to time to stiffen rates with more or less success, but the improved conditions seldom endure. C. F. Daly, general passenger agent of the Lake Erie & Western, who returned from New York Saturday, states that the meeting of the joint passenger committee was a very harmonious one. Commissioner Farmer stated there has not been any ser ious occasion for a meeting, but some of the members thought it best that all should get together once before the close of the year, and if there were any critical differ ences have them promptly adjusted. It developed that prevailing conditions were agreeable, and there is nothing in the situ ation at present to cause strained relations. Pittsburg- Post: "If the pass abolition compact is carried out as worded L. F. Loree, president of the Raltimore & Ohio and the chief promoter of the scheme, will pay his fare after January next, and all other presidents and general managers will have to do likewise. The order calls for the entire abolition of exchange passes, and it is not to be presumed that President Loree will ask for a pass for himself over an other line unless he wants to create the Impression that presidents and other offi cials were not to be included in the ar rangements to cut off all the passes. Con eluetors on passenger trains will have to take the liberty of asking Mr. Loree to produce his ticket when he visits Pittsburg on the Pennsylvania lines, and President A. J. Cassatt may have to pay fare on the Baltimore & Ohio if he uses that line." DU. W. A. 

IIAKTLETT. lie Spenks In teret Intsly- of the Presi dent' MesMagc. Utlca (N. Y.) Press. Tn his address the other evening at the First Presbyterian Church in this city the Rev. Dr. W. A. Hartlett made compliment ary reference to President Roosevelt's message to Congress. He did not dwell upon the point which came up in.identally In the course of his remarks. Dr. Rartlett has spent several yearn in Washington and is thoroughly well acquainted with public men and public affairs. He was in Utica yesterday, and in response to a request to give at greater length his opinion regard ing the President's message, he said: "It is difficult to take a snap shot at a document so long and so charged with thought on all the great problems of this Nation and the world. It makes the Im pression of the President under his full sense of responsibility, registering with ease his conclusions, and not struggling pen-in-hand for opinions and rhetoric. He does not make a rehash of the reports of his Cabinet ministers, but handles in a masterly manner the burning questions of the hour in national and international affairs. It is pellucid English, with just sufficient explanations to support his views. On the forty-five topics, as marked in the Press, he has positive opinions or urgent recommendations to Congress. He disposes of the Anarchist, immigration and the Chinese invasion according to the pop ular demand. He handles with fresh intel ligence irrigation and forestry and forces them to the front for new legislation. After granting to combinations of capital their beneficent inlluence in our national development, he suggests their control in one word 'publicity' and on the result of such publicity he recommends a general law. so the octopus Is harnessed and pulls. "It is a worthy twentieth century docu ment, giving a higher motive to all out standing problems. It elevates politics to statesmanship and diplomacy to the stand ard of the golden rule. It is so frank no one would suspect it of a sinister eye to future advantage. It is a step toward per manent prosperity and peace. It invites arbitration and International friendship and is a reach toward universal brother hood. With its intellectual positiveness it has delicate human sympathy and refined appreciation. It opens with sobs over the supreme tragedy of the era and closes with reminiscent sorrow over the death of two European sovereigns. Humbert and Vic toria. Never did such battle-full opinions have a more dainty binding between two covers a sob and a memory." The Horrors of War.

AYER & SON, Chestnut and Euhta street. Philadelphia. RACING OVER THE SNOW CONTINUOUS PROGRAMME ON NORTH CAPITOL AVENUE. Members of the Driving; Clnh ntul Other Owners of Fast Horses Out In Sleighs. North Capitol avenue was converted into a race course yesterday afternoon, and be tween Ohio and St. Clair streets there Were many contests. There were hardly a dozen wheeled vehicles on the thoroughfare dur ing the afternoon, the sleighs having com plete ownership jof the best racing street in the city. While there was a strong dis crimination against anything with wheels to it, there was but little against the vari ous kinds of sleighs. Anything that could glide along the icy street was welcomed. The horsemen with good speeders turned up a frosty, ruby-colored nose at the "nags" that togged along, but there was no ill feeling toward the sleighs. The racing began early in the afternoon. It was a little too cold for comfort, but that did not hinder the lovers of the sport from enjoying the first sleighing of the winter. There were many fast horses on the street, members of the Driving Club and others that own animals that can go better than "three flat" being in the merry panorama of Hying, Jingling sleighs. There was a desire to slip past the sleigh 'just ahead. These attempts to go to the front were always accepted as challenges for a burst of speed. Pedestralns were not mo lested by the sleighs, as there were but few persons on the avenue who cared to cross the street. All along the avenue families gathered at the front windows and watched the sport. Here and there could be seen men and women and children at windows, who gave evidence that they did not depend upon gas to heat their houses, but at three-fourths of tho windows women were bundled In wraps, and they looked as chilly as the outdoor atmosphere felL LOCAL PRODUCE MARKET DEALERS THINK THEY DIDN'T DO ENOUGH DISINESS. Prlees Are Firm and High nnd Look to lie Higher Poultry In Liberal Supply The Trade In Grains. In the week ended on Dee. 14 trade was disappointing in volume. Two rainy days and a snowstorm on Saturday were among the drawbacks to business. Besides this, as is usual with the approach of the holi days in some lines, trade falls off percep tibly. Dealers in fancy notions, confec tioneries and the like are very busy, but with the dry-goods houses, the produce merchants and on Commission row trade has been rather slow. Prices on Commis sion row have been well maintained, and there is hardly an article that is lower than a week ago, while several are higher. Retailers are' complaining that trade has fallen off since Thanksgiving, but this does not affect prices, which, on the articles most used, rule steady. Irish potatoes, apples and all fruits and vegetables are selling slowly, but it is thought that with milder and fair weather business will im prove and there will be no room for com plaint. Flour rules easier, with the weaker tone to the wheat market, but other prod ucts of wheat, corn and oats are firm and move rapidly, as they are taking the place of potatoes to some extent. Sugars and cof fees are firmer and all staple groceries rule steady and firm. Druggists report trade good. Linseed oil Is stronger, but other lines are unchanged. There Is no im provement in the poultry and game mar kets, while prices are practically the same. The supply of game and of hens and chick ens is large. Turkeys are not so abundant, but farmers are supposed to be holding them for the holidays. The supply of fresh eggs is more liberal and prices rule easier, but dealers are not inclined to make con cessions, as they believe weather condi tions will improve the market soon and force up prices. Butter, if choice, is firm and in good request. Poor stock sells slower and at low figures. Dried fruits on the Pacific coast are higher, and dealers here are disposed to follow the example. Present prices rule strong. Indianapolis Grain Market. Receipts of the past week have been more liberal than in any week for some months. For all cereals there has been a good demand. Prices on wheat have varied during the week about 3 cents, and on corn. 1 cent. Oats are firm at prices quoted and in good request. The week closed with prices, as reported by the sec retary of the Board of Trade, ruling as fol lows: Wheat firm; No. 2 red. 82'Ac track; No. 2 red.
