Son of an American missionary to ' Japan, Willard Dlckerman Straight's I career was one of the most Interesting ! and remarkable of any young Yankee; i of this generation. Typically Ameri ! can, brilliant in initiative, a natural diplomat, he arose from obscurity to i an important position as a financier ' when little more than 30 years of age. ! A master of Chinese and Japanese I pol'tlcs and culture he became the j right hand man of great American ' bankers and was their representative in the Far East when, with British, French and other European financiers i they undertook to syndicate a loan of I $27,000,000 to China. : Wllilard D. Straight was born in : Oswego, N. Y., on Jan. 31, 1880. Years of residence in China and Japan gave i him a valuable insight into, native 1 character. Two years after his grad ; nation from Cornell in 1901 young I Straight went back to China and en i terod the service of the Chinese Im j per'.nl Maritime Customs Service un ' der Sir Robert Hart where he was assigned to Nanking and Peking. In 1004, when the Kusso-Japanese war started. Straight resigned his post, and, with the view of broaden i ing his knowledge of Eastern affairs and peoples, went to Manchuria as a correspondent for The Associated Press. Early in 1905 as a result of illness he was ordered home and at I Petrograd met the late George von I : Meyer, then Ambassador to Russia, and later Secretary of the Navy. Shortly after returning to New York and recovering his health Mr. Straight was appointed Vice Consul General at ' Seoul., Korea, and the next year re , lved his credentials as American ' Consul General at Mukden, where he remained until 1908. Returning to the United States on i leave in the fall of 1908, Mr. Straight ' was dotailed as Acting Chief of the i Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs of the State Department. Later, when a syn dicate of American bankers, co-operating with the State Department, un dertook in the summer of 1909 to ne gotiate with British, French and other European bankers, the so-called "Six Power Loan" to China, Mr. Straight resigned from the State Department and was appointed the representative of the American group in Peking. Although not yet 30 years old, Mr. Straight was at this time reported to be receiving a salary of $50,000 a year. J. P. Morgan, the elder, was said to have selected him for the job. In 1D11 Mr. Straight married Miss Bulletin, Washington, Dec. 2 In an address to Congress in joint session today President Wilson announced his intention to go to Paris for the peaca conference saying the allied govern ments have accepted principles annunciated by him for peace find it is his paramount duty to be present. He said: "Gentlemen of the congress, as I have stood before you doing my duty from time to time, information of the state has been crowded with great events. Great processes and great results that I cannot hope to give you an adequate picture of, or of the far reaching changes which have been wrought in the life of our nation and of the world. You have yourselves wit nessed these things as I have. It is too soon to assess them; and, we who stand in the midst of them and are part of them are less qualified than men of another generation will be to say what they mean, or even what they have been. But some great outstanding facts are unmistakable and constitute in a sense part of the public business with which it is our duty to deal. To state them is to set the stage for the legislative and executive action which must grow out of them and which we have yet to shape and determine. A year ago we had sent 14o,198 men overseas. Since then we have sent 1,950,513, an average of 162.542 each month the number in fact rising in May last to 245,951, in July to 205,182, and continuing to reach similar figures in August and Septem bcr, in August 287,270 and in September 257,438. t !

But it is not the physical scale and executive efficiency of preparation, supply, equipment and despatch that I would dwell upon, but the mettle and quality of the officers and men sent over, and of the sailors who kept the seas and the spirit of the nation that stood behind them. No soldiers or sailors ever proved themselves more quickly ready for the test of bat tle or acquitted themselves with more splendid courage and achievement when put to the test. Those of us who played some part in directing the great processes by which the war was pushed lrrestibly forward to the final triumph may now forget that and de light our thoughts of the story of what our men did. "Their officers un derstood the grim and exacting task they had undertaken to perform with Dorothy Payne Whitney, daughter of : audacity, efficiency and unhestitating the late William Whitney, Secretary i courage that touched the story of con. f the Navy In the cabinet of Presi ient Cleveland, and one of America's wealthiest young women.

Their contri bution to the great result is beyond appraisal. They have added a new lustre to the annals of American womanhood. The least tribute we can pay them is to make the equals of men in polit ical rights as they have proved them selves their equals in every field of practical work they entered. These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered, the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the systematic economies by which our people have assisted to supply the suffering peoples of the world and armies upon every front with food and everything else that we had that might serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never be fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we can say that we are the kinsmen of such. And now, we are sure of the great triumph for every sacrifice was made. It has come; come in its com pleteness and with the pride and in spiration of these days of achievement quick within us we turn to the tasks Washington, Dec. 2. Problems of peace and Teeonstruetion promise to occupy fully the third and last ses sion of the Sixty-Fifth Congress which opened today at noon to continue un til it ends by limitation on March 4. After a ten day holiday following the second war session most of the mem bers of the Senate and House were on hand to start the work of the winter. Framing of the legislative program had been held in abeyance to await the address of President Wilson, an hour after the opening. This session will consider an enor mous amount of business. The usual formalities of the opening of a new session were hurried through because of the President being about to sail for Emope. After calls on Senate and House to see if there were quorums, commit tees were appointed to notify the President and the respective branches of congress that the new session had begun. Long before the noon nvening hour, spectators throngefl into the capital, particularly intio the House, where the joint session will ibe held and where the President will deliver his address. In his address President Wilson said he would be in close touch with cable and wireless, and that all that he does on the other side will be known. Referring to his announcement thrt the French and British governments had removed all cable restrictions upon the transmission of news of the conference to America, the President said he had taken over the American cable systems on expert invitation of a unified system. He expressed the hope that he would have the co-operation of the public and of Congress, saying through the cables and wireless con stant counsel and advice would be possible. The President paid some attention to the railroads. The President . declared he stood Washington, Dec. 2 The War De partment today issued the following statement based on a cable from Gen eral Pershing, dated Nov. 29, and ent in reply to an inquiry cabled by Gen eral March: "American prisoners released from German prison camps complain of poor and scanty food and bad housing conditions. Only a small percentage of those who are sick are hospital cases. The majority are suffering from slight colds and the prospect is that all will recover rapidly with proper food and housing. There is no evidence of discrimination against the American prisoners. "Among 7,000 prisoners of all na tionalities who have been released there is no authenticated instance of brutality against the Americans. "The majority of the American pris oners state that the German soldiers also suffered food privations, but that in cases where the supply of food was insufficient food for the prisoners was cut off before that of the German sol diers."

INGENUITY DEVISED A NEW FORM OF KILLING With the British-American Armies, Dec. 2 (Correspondence of the Asso ciated Press) German deviltry seem ed to know no bounds in the last days of the fighting on the British fronl after the Hindenburg line had been shattered. They attached grenades to the bodies pt dead Hun left behind in the German retreat, so that when the bodies were lifted the grenade ex ploded, killing or wounding the bear ers. Near the town of Lo Cateau, a num ber of Australian stretcher-bearers were killed by these grenades in at tempting to remove some German dead from the field in front of an American ' machine-gun position. Thereafter no Australian would put a hand on a dead German. ' In some cases the bodies were dragged to their burial places by means of a long rope which allowed the stretcher-bearers to keep out of range of any exploding hand-grenades. The Americans, on the other hand, hit upon the plan of making the Ger man prisoners bury their own dead. General Von Born and Count Von Arnim Asso ciated With Hlin.

The President said he hoped to see a formal declaration of peace by treaty "by the time spring has come." No definite program of reconstruc tion can be outlined now, Mr. Wilson said, but as soon as the armistice was signed, government control of business and industry was released as far as possible. He expressed the hope that Congress would not object to con ferring upon the war trade board or some other agency the right of fixing export priorities to assure shipment of food to starving people abroad. As to taxation, the President en dorsed the plan for levying six bil lion dollars in 1919 and for notifying public in advance that the 1919 levy would be four billion dollars. The new three-year naval building pro gram was endorsed because, the President said it would be unwise to attempt to adjust the American pro gram to a future world policy as yet undetermined. Declaring he had no private thought or purpose in going to France but that he regarded it as his highest duty, the President added. "It is now my duty to play my full part in mak ing good what they (America's sol diers) offered their lives' blood' to ob tain."

His advance headquarters will be estab lished at Treves, where Gen. Preston Brown will be military Governor and Gen. Harry A. Smith in charge of civil affairs. The advance yesterday averaged twelve miles. TREVES OLDEST TOWN IN GERMANY Paris. Dec. 2 Eight days remain for the Germans to evacuate the left bank of the Rhine from Lower Alsace to Holland. French and Allied forces which crossed the German frontier yesterday have received strict instruc tions as to their attitude toward the German population in the occupied territories. France will be represent ed by contingents in all enemy terri tory, according to an announcement. Treves is situated on the right bank of the Moselle River fifty-seven miles southwest of Coblenz. It is perhaps the oldest town in Germany and is rich in Roman relics. Among the main objects of interest in the town are the cathedral, which is one of the oldest in Germany, and the Provincial Museum, with a fine collection of antiquities. Treves became an archiepiscopal see f-in the ninth century and the Arch bishops rose to the position of princes and occupied a place among the im perial electors. Near the close of the sixteenth century it was recognized as a free imperial city and the ecclesiasti cal principality was wiped out in the Secretary Daniels announced there the recent coup de'etat of the Slber-1 will be no demobilization of the ian government. Marine Corps until after peace. London, Dec. 2 (Correspondence of the Associated Press) The British government has completed its basic plans for demobilization of the army and providing employment for the man whose sole business for four years has been war. It is calculated that 60 per cent, of the men in the army will go back to their old jobs or have new ones awaiting' them but taking care of the remainder even though every ounce of man-power will be needed after the war, presents a most difficult problem. It will be a long tedious task to transform millions of men from khaki to civil life and must be done by de grees. By the plan agreed upon these degrees have been fixed upon the needs of industry with certain consid eration being given to married men or those who may otherwise be needed in the home. The government has a record of what each man is best fitted for in civil life. The Ministry of Public Ser vice which has efficiently compiled this data has, together with other of ficial agencies, prepared a list of necessary industries in the order of what is deemed their importance. The first few are called "key" trades, many of which produce materials needed for use in other trades. The Idea is that it would be useless to release at lot of structural steel workers ahead of the men who produce steel. The trades list is complete but will not be an nounced because of controversies it might arouse. The fact that a man has a job awaiting him will not insure his early release. The government would like to be rid of that class but it cannot handle more than half the army at one time, hence a rigid adherence to industrial needs. A soidicr may be a diamond setter with a job to go to while his trench mate may be a rail way brakeman without a job. The brakeman will be taken first and given an opportunity to go to work. Needed for Railroads. It is resasonable to suppose that railway workmen, if not heading the "key" list, are very close to the top of it and also that miners are well up. It is vitally necessary to demobiliza tion plans to have the railways in run ning order and the miners are needed to increase the fuel supply for indus tries and home comfort. And so ion down the long list until practically every recognized trade is included. Wrhen a man has been selected for discharge he will be sent to a collect ing camp, the most of which of course will be in France. He will then be sent to a distributing camp in England where he will receive his allowance for civilian clothing. He will be given a month's furlough which will mean that he will be on army pay while getting located in new work. From this stage the Minister of Labor assumes charge. He will have the aid and co-operation of local employers, associations and labor unions. Al ready long lists of jobs open to sol diers have been prepared. It remains for the government, employers and unions to get the job and the man together. other cities, while the government has long lists of suspects, who had planned to seize members of the present gov ernment. No direct evidence of William E henzollern's connection with the plot has been found, it is said, but it is believed that the outline of the plan was brought to Berlin by two of his suite, who recently went to the Ger man capital for the ostensible purpose of faking the wife of the former em peror to Ameriongen, Holland. Lieutenant Dr. Gustav Krupp von Bohlen is said to have been in control of the financial arrangements. Field Marshal von Mackensen is reported to have attempted to induce Field Marshal von Hindenburg to Join, but the later refused, raying he intend ed to retire after the demobilization of the army. The whole Prussian court, it is stated, was in sympathy with the plotters, and it is said Prince von Buelow and Dr. Georg Michaelis. former Imperial chancellor, had promised to help. The plan was to organize a provisional . government under Field Marshal von Mackensen or some other military leader and then urge William Hohenzollern to return. iURETANIA IN
