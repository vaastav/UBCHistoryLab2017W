THE ADVERTISER T. II. FISITELl. EDITOR. DROWXVILLE, SATURDAY, UEC. C, 1852. Rnniored Removal or Burnside. There is a rumor in town, brought ly passengers from St. Joseph, and said to bo a dispatch in the St. Louis Republi can of the 3d, purporting that Burnside has been removed. We received papers by last evening's mail of as late date as the Republican, but they did not contain anything of iu Gen. Hooker is said to succeed to the command of the army of the Potomac. Nebraska caYalry. The mustering officer passed up on the stage for Omaha, ve understand, cn Thursday last. The regiment is now nearly or quite full. More companies were offered than were accepted. Two more companies would have formed here, if the Governor would have granted commissions. It is mcch easier to raise ti r 1 1 1 a lull company or one nunarea. men, (where all will have a chance either to get an office, or to assist in electing some of their friends,) than it is to' raise ten men to fill up a company already organ ized. Judge Wheeler intends starting for Omaha with the requisite number of men to complete Lieut. Keith's company, early next week. Companies "C" and 'E," from this county, have lost several men by death and otherwise. Recruits to fill them will start up probably on Monday. The Republican notices the arrival of the Richardson county company, one hun- A 1 J C.C. Small Currency. The premium on Gold and Silver his driven almost all small change out of circulation. To meet this deficiency, Government has provided the Pcstoffice currency ; but so great is the demand that its existence is hardly noticed. In answer to inquiries, it was telegraphed to Cincinnati a few days ago, that no more could be furnished the West for 8reral month?. In this emergency the bankers of Ohio are discussing the pro prity of issuing checks in denominations of five, ten, and twenty-five cents. The law there is severe against issuing shin plasters but they intend evading the law. In this territory merchants, to meet the wants of community, have issued dueUils, in small sums, printed on cards See. In orne places they have been indicted for evading the law, but as the law is not literally broken, and as the whole com munity is interested, we think the in dictments will not amount to much. St. Louis Republican. In another column we publish the prospectus of this journal. We are gratified to again num ber it among our exchanges. It is an exceedingly conservative paper, yet even it has been impelled by the current of public opinion to progress a little. It now denies being pro-slavery It is in favor, however of letting slavery entirely a lone. It is extremely careful to do no thing or favor no measure that could pos sibly cither directly or indirectly injure the peculiar institution. The Republican has always assumed a high tone, and, ap parently, at least, treated all subjects with candor. It is a pretty go$d index of public opinion in Missouri. If Mis souri should be largely and decliedly in favor of canibalism or any other great evil, the Republican would say no word against it, or if it did, it would be very moderate and very dignified in its re proaches. During the last Presidential campaign, the Democracy of Mo. were nearly unanimously for Douglas, the Re publican was, therefore, quite hostile to the Breckinridge party and to secession isra. But in the spring of 'Gl,- when it was thought doubtful as to which side Mo would take, when Claib Jackson, to use his owu words, was trying to "take the State out of the Union, or take her her to h 1," the Republican was waver ing some of its articles bordering on treason as much as it dare make them, Again, when Fremont was assigned the Department of Missouri, the Republican condescended to give him its support, and regretted that the President saw fit to remove him. But now, since it is part of the democratic programme to laud McCIellan, and abuse Fremont, the Re publican does not hesitate to kick the dead lion. The BrownTille, Neb., Advertiser says that a large number of the farmers of Nebraska iuend shipping their surplus grain, pork and other produce to Colora do, as being the only way arparent to turn it into money. Send it along, and send the live porkers also. Rocky -Mountain A'cws. To be Contested. On Saturday evening Mr. Knox served Gen.

Fbiesd Fisher: In my last "epistle" I spoke of a dog feast to come off in a short time, but on account of the scarcity of the animal it has been indifiuitely postponed. Wre have a few in camp of the lean kind, none fat enough for the occasion, a lact to be regretted. I was thinking what a fine time we could have if we only had "stuff-gut," a beautiful creature that belonged to Sut Lovegood. Notwithstundmg the sad disappoint ment, I have just returned from a sump tuous feat prepared by Weboloquah, wife of Nicholas Ianis. The leading dishes were Eviyauns, Bangssovije, and Bou daire, all French or Indian. I can only remember the component parts cf the Boudaire, as it suited my taste to a charm, being of delicious flavor, and already prepared for digestion, an important con sideration in the absence of JJolars." I state the components, as stated to me, by the proprietor of the "lodge," a3 follows: Beef, Antelope, Beaver, and Wolf. On investigating the reason for using the wolf-meat, I was told that the nice flavor was imparted by it. This being a well established mountain fact, and having experienced it myself, I will take v:olf in "mine," in the future. The climate cf Halleck is dry and cold, and as to wir.d it has no equal. Many appear, at the constant and terrific "blows," quite astonished ; but when I found out that Halleck was in Nebraska, my astonishment subsided. We have snow riA full view from the end cf one year to the beginning of the other, and I am informed ice half an inch thick is common in the month of July. Through the medium of the "tlectic fiuid it is known here, among the "first settlers," that James Coleman, II. M. Atkinson, and T. W, Bedford are anx ious to "bleed and die,"' in defence of Nebraska against "domestic, bad, and hostile Indians." In consequence of this item of news, Big Smoke, Little Tliun- 1 1 11 "ITU T t in uer, uiacic jear, leuow iiair, nne Face and Crow Feather, are coming into the Forts to make peace. When such intelligence is "flashed along'! the line, it is hih time the Indian tribes wore "fleeing to the Mountains." Next summer it is thought the Government will let contracts for killing off hese unwor thy 'children," and I hope the Nebraska Second will be the successful competitor for the contract. The compaign against the thievirg and marauding bands of savages that roam through these moun tains and plains, will commence, I am in formed by the President, at some indifi nite period ia the future. It may be well for the Government to be cn hand with a full supply of "presents" early in the spring to remunerate the Indianfor.the lives and properly taki'ii this winter. Scalping men, women and children, and. stealing stock of various kinds, is a small matter. A few blankets, etc., smooths the affair, and thus the "Great Father" at Washingjon shows the f irit of Chris tianity by ''overcoming- evil with gooJ." Religion is a stroug feature in our Gov ernment: so say all of us at Halleck. What of the war ? Has the rebellion been crushed ? I fear, in the language of Ayer's American Almanac, "we have not seen the beginning of the end" of cur National struggle. Comparatively speaking only a drop of blood has crim soned the battle field : oceans must, no doubt, yet be poured out! Gcd grant that war may cease, and our nation be once more united ! What of Brownville ? Are you all dead? If so, will some of you be kind as to send the news? If the proprietor of the "Squatter Pill" has not worked himself out of Nebraska, tell him prairie dog oil is a certaia cure for a peculiar "illness," and can be used for "man and beast," but is useful for the rest of crea tion. Is the Colonel cf the First Indian Regiment all right? Hope he is win ning laurels of fame in behalf of the Con stitution "as it used to was," Da Com mander of the D. I's. The infernal wolves are barking and howling near my cabin like a pack of old and young devils, disturbing my nerves so much that I must seek my "downy couch," which, in the language of moun tain men, means "down" on the ground. Broomstick, Jr. Letter from the Nebraska Cavalry. IIeaKvI" AETHits Co. 4,E," IVeb. Cavalry.) Omaha, Ni:s:;assa, Nov. 23, 1802. J Friend Fisher : To-day the wind has blown a perfect hurricane up here where we are quartered. It is as much as a person can do to keep from being blown over by the wind. On Wednesday, (the 2Gth) the Nebraska City company, under Capt. Laboo, arrived here and encamped about two miles from town. It is not quite full, but they expect some more re cruits this week. There are now nine companies ready to be mustered into the service. On Wednesday evening I went up to Florence, where company "C" is quartered. The boys are do'in fine ; all in good houses, and their horses in sta bles. They are all in gocd spirits would rather fight rebels than Indians. Some of our boys are pretty wild, and do not think the officers have any control over them until they are mustered into the service, and they do not mind their superior officers ; but after we are rnas sered in, the boys will net have such an area for fun as they have now. We drill twice every day, but as lam laid up with a sore foot, I have to put my time in in reading and writing. The company from Falls City is ex pected here to-day, as they were in Ne braska City night before last. Inside of two weeks the regiment will be full to its maximum number. Our minor officers do not quite under stand their business. Some of them fall asleep and let the guard stay on all night Such a case happened last night: the men were put on at 9 o'clock, and stood until 4 this morning. All are anxious to know where we will go when mus tered in. The majority of the regiment would rather go South and fight, than to stay up North here doing nothing. I doubt whether we will have a fight with the Indians in our whole nine months, without going west of Ft. Laramie on the road to Salmon River Gold Mines. It has been pretty cold since we came here. The men do not feel it, but our horses have suffered extremely. Wre have moved them down in a big hollow, and the cold does not effect them at all now. I believe I have written all the news. Will write again soon. Yours respectfully, Corporal. For the Nebraska Advertiser. Diversity or Human Races. Mr. Editor: I have frequently heard this topic debated in' conversations, and even lately: some maintaining the affir mative on the subject, and others . the negative. It is a falsehood, exclaimed some men. with vehemence, that all men have the same origin that all men are descendants of Adam and of Noah. We have already, at least, seven or eight species of men upon earth, viz., the White, the Negroes, the Moors, the Tartars, the Laplanders, the Patagonians, the Albinos, the American Indians. Shall we give to all these different spe cies cf men the same origin ? As well give a common origin to dogs and wolves, to rabbits and foxes, which are cf a diff erent species, and of which one does not come from the other. The difficulty of which it is a question here was for a while, and is, even now with some pprsons, like a cry of war; if we may so exprees ourselves ; but a more enlightened philosophy has and does reject such a futile and ruinous doc trine. In the following assertions and remarks, I intend to throw some light and fix some ideas on the diversity of human races, as far as I am able, and you may publish them if you think proper : Assertion 1st. There is, onihe whole known surface of the globe, but one and same species of man. Epplas atiox. All the inhabitants of . our globe, from North to South, from Jast'lo West, have everywhere the same essential constituting elements, the same dbtructive and specific characters, name ly: the fame structure of bones, of mus cles, of nerves, of fibers, of flesh ; the same order, the same arrangement, the same destination in all the fundamental parts of that admirable edifice ; the same construction and the same formation in the organs, destined to offer to our view- sensible objects; the same way and the progression in the formation, the nuiri tion, the growth and the decline of the iridi.'idual ; the same means of preserv in g, of reproducing, of multiplying their species; the sirne number of intellectual faculties, designed to enlighten them on the present, on the past, on the future, on animate and inanimate objects, on physical and rural good. The organization on which depend mostly, in all men, the action and play of all intellectual and sensible faculties, is more perfect in soma than in other ; for instance, in the Europeans than in the Africans, in certain individuals than in other individuals, according to the. diver sity of the climates they inhabit, of the air them breathe, of the food they take, of the mode of life, they lead, of the edu cation they receive, of the temperament they have ; but the fundamental part of the organization is everywhere the same; and this fundamental part diflers but ac cidental) by a little more cr a little less delicacy or strength, suppleness or rigid ity, mobility or torpidity in the organs. All men, black or white, civilized or uncivilized, are perfectible, not only in the physical and mechanical play of their organs, but also in their ideas, in their tho's, in thoir sentiments, in their man ners, in their morals ; and this constitutes in them the intellectual 'perfectibility per fectibility which essentially distinguishes them from every other living species. This intellectual perfeclibility is not equal in all nations and in all individuals ; but everywhere it exists, and everywhere it shows itself and is felt, either in the way of knowledge, or in the way of senti ments, to a certain degree, in man, at the expulsion of every other living and ani mate species. One and the same construction, one and the same organization, one and the same intellection, one and the same destination of the whole and every part of that whole, evidently demonstrate in all hu man races, one and the same nature, one and the same species; therefore there is but one and the same species of men; therefore human species is not suscepti ble cf any fundamental subdivision ia the way cf nature. t - '';.. Remarks. 1. In the animal kingdom and sometimes in the vegetable kingdom, we call individual, a being caique, isola ted and circumscribed in its own nature. Such is Aristes, such is Sylvia, in the human species. - Such' is Bucephalus, such is Rossinaates, in the species of horses, et cetera: Eus individum, sen ens in naiura sua indivisuw. 2. The collection of all the individuals which have a nature consimilar in all that nature requires as essential and funda mental, are a species. In the animal kingdom, we call ani mals of the same species, those among which the union of the male and female procreates a similar animal, capable of being reproduced in the same way. We call animals of different species those among which the union of the male and female, either is impossible or never pro creates anything, cr produces a mongrel called mule, which takes after both par ents, and which, united to his like, is never reproduced. 3. A term which expresses, or an idea which represents several different spe cies, is a genus. Genus is to species what species is to individuals. However, in common language, mankind and human race are two terms perfectly synony mous. A. G. ( to be continued.) Camp near Patterson, Mo., 1 Heaucuakters Co.

IVAsmifGTOx, Nov. 27. Reports re ceived here from the front to-day locate Jackson's advance jruard at Bealstown, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, near the Rappahannock, in a position to endeavor to hold Sigel's force from ad vancing or to fall upon the rear of Rurn side's army, as may be most adrisable. Other reports scatter his forces along along the eastern base of the Blue Rndjre from the Rappahannock to Snicker's Gap, placing the bulk in advance, leav ing parties in the rear to observe and harass our lines. Washington, Nov. 23. We have but little news from Fredericksburg beyond the fact that all is quiet. An officer from there who arrived this evening, and who who was over in Fredericksburg under a flag of truce, says Lee is massing the bulk of his army there, and that the reb els already have earthworks more for minable than ours. The river might have been crossed a week ago, perhaps with ease, but it cannot be denied that it would be a serious undertaking now. No signs of immediate, active hostilities are visible. Oa the other hand another officer from Fredericksburg brings the somewhat im probable story that he yesterday heard Burnside himself say that he would bring on an engagement next week. Gen. Grant' recent orders putting the whole cotton trade, ia. the scat of . war, in the .hands of the Government, and secu ring the enormous profits of the trade to the Government or its agents, are be lieved here to be the forerunner of the adoption of a similar policy throughout the entire region in which our armies are operating. Amusement continues lo be expressed on the unexpected feature of the contra band demonstration yesterday. Senator Poineroy had been making a speech urg ing his CUiriqui Colonization scheme'. A negro replied very vigorously, denoun cing the scheme and all who had any thing to do with it. It has not yet been ascertained whether Pomeroy intends to continue the debate. Washington. Nov. CO. Commission er Dole has written a letter to the Sec retary of the Interior for the President, which will be published in the morning, on the subject of the proposed execution of the condemned Indians in Minnesota, protesting against it and taking the gen eral ground that the instigators of the outbreak should be hung, but that the mere followers, no matter how barlarous their deedss, slumld be pardoned ; and urging that this course will have a much more beneficial effect on the Indians than a wholesale hanging. The President's message was printed at two this evening. It discusses at some length the compensated emancipation scheme, and our complicated foreign re lations, and is understood to come out vigorously in the defense of the emanci pation proclamation. It is celieved, also, that it will renew the recommendation for a military railroad to Cumberland Gap and Point of Rocks. It is not im possible, however, that it may yet be changed in one or two particulars. There is no prospect of a speedy move ment on Frederickahursr. The rebels are still throwing up forti fications. WSsiiingtox, Dec. 1. The Presi dent's Message is spoken of on all hands as the best written and the best consid ered of any he has ever submitted. Tht radical Republicans are not particularly well pleased witfi his lengthy argument in favor of compensated emancipation, but the becession sympathizing members are far worse pleased with the quiet way in wuica he treats the emancipation proc lamation as a thing accomplished, and with which Congress has nothing to do It commands much attention. 

LATER rilOM RICHMOND. A Panic In the Itebcl Capitol Matistical fzsiormation ol the Rebel Army iiurnside Confi dent of Success. Washington, Nov. 30. The people of Richmond have been having another panic for the last two weeks. The re moval of McCIellan aud the rapidity of Uiirnsuo s movement were the first causes. At ihe time of Burnside's move ment. Longstreet wa3 in Richmond on his way to North Carolina the cam paign in Virginia being supposed to be over for the winter. Part of his corps were with him. They were put on the works around Richmond at once, while he took the cars for Fredericksburg to hold the Rappahannock line if possible ; and if not, to retard our movement till Lee came up. There are now from 20,000 to 2-5,000 men in the works aroud Richmond, and but 80,000 north of there, iucluJing Lee's aud Jackson's forces. Jackscn has been recalled, with Hill and Stu trt, from the Yalley, to form the left Hank of Lee s army. Jackson was opposed to coming, and wanted to keep up a division of our for ces by raids in Maryland and Pennsyl vania, but was overruled by Lee and Davis. The Cabinet at Richmond have ordered Lee to thrown his whole army on the Rappahannock, and dispute eyery foot of ground thence to the rebel capital. They have plenty of raw provisions, and millions pounds of beef, pork and flour are accumulating at Richmond. Vessels with clothing are running the blockade every week, but their army is still suffering terribly. Numerous recent events have served to inflame the Richmond panic, such as Lee's suddenly changing from the offen sive to ihe defensive; his telegraphing daily for more men to save the capital ; petitions and appeals of their army for clothing; General Dix's capture of their pickets on the Chickahominy ; the dis covery that thf?y have lost from 60,000 to 100,000 men in the last 95 days by battle, sickness and desertion, and indi cations of slave insurrections at holidays. Burnside and Government are believed to have full acquaintance with these facts, and Burnside regards his present force ample for the work before him. Loan and the Liusii' ivhaclLers.
