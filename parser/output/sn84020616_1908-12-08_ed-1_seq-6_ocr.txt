It Is difficult to have path nco with tho urgumcnt.i of these poiscn. Thanks to our own recklessness in tho uso of our splendid forests, wo liavo. already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and no measures that we now tako can, at least for many years, undo thu mischief being done; and it would be, in the highest degree reprehensible to- let any consideration of temporary convenience or temporary cost inter fere with such action, especially us regards the national forests wrieh the nation can now, at this very mo incut, control. All serious students of the question arc aware of thu great damage tin t has been done in the Mediterrani an countries of Europe, Asiu. and Af rica by deforestation. The sliuilur damage that has been d ine in east ern Asia is loss well known. A re cent investigation into conditions in Korth China by Mr. Frank X. Mover, of the bureau of plant indu-ly of the United States department of. ag riculture, ha ine'd ntally furnish' d lu very strtkilng fashion proof of the ruin that conies from reckless dufor----lon of mountains, und ot the her fact that tho damage once may prove practically irrei ar V fcki important are these luvoi tfons that I herewith attach us 'Jppendix to my message certain tographs showing present condl ,.onS in China. They show in vivid fashion the appalling desolation, tak ing the shapo of barren mountains and gravel and sand-covered plains, which Immediately follows and de pends upon the defori station of the mountains. Xot many centuries ago the country of northern China was ono of the most fertile and beautiful spots In the entire world, und was heavily forested. We know this not only from the old Chinese records, but from the account. given by the traveler Marco Polo. He, for in stance, mentions that in visiting the provinces or Siiausi and Slunsi he observed many plantations of mul berry trees. Xow there is hardly a single mulberry tree in either of thetu provinces, und the culture of the silk worm has moved farther south, to regions of atmospheric moisture. As an Illustration ot the complete change ill the rivers, wo may take Polos statement that a certain rivi r, the Hun Ho, was so largo and deep that merchants ascended it from tho sea with heavily laden boats; to day Mils river is imply a broad san dy bed, with shallow, rapid eurriula -wandering hither and thither aevos it, absolutely unnuvigublc. Hut we do not have to depend upon write u records. Tho dry wells, and the w- lis with water far below the former wu termark, bear testimony to the .good days of the past and the e vil dajs of tho present. "Wherever the native Vegetation ha been allowed to r - as, for Instance, lore unl tirWO around a sacred temple or Im-i.-f&l burying ground, there urq st 11 trees and tangled jungle, fiug- of the glorious ancient forests, lliick, matted forest growtn tormcrly covered the mountains to their summits. All natuiul factors favored this dense forest growth, und as long as it as permitted to cxbt, tho plains at the foot of tlic moun tains were among the mat fertile em thu globe, and the whole country was a garden. Xot the llghtett i f foit was made, however, to prevent the unchecked cutting of the trees. Or tj secure reforestation. Doubtless for many centuries tho tree-cutting by the inhabitants of tho mountains worked but slowly in bringing about the changes that have now cone to pase; doublets. for generations the Inroads were sc-irccly noticeable. Hut there came a time when the forest had hhrunk Bufliciently to make each years cutting a seiious matter and from that time on the destruction proceeded with appalling rapidity; for of course each ' ar of b stru -tlon rendered the fori at less ab'e to recuperate, ! m able to resist xt year' Inroad. Mr. Meyer describes the ceaseless progress of the di siruv tion even now, when there la so little left to destroy. Kveiy morning no a and boys go out aimed with mattox or axe, cu!e the steepest nioun'ia n aides, and cut down and grub nir, root and branch, the small trees and shrubs Hill to be found. The bl disappeared centime oro. p or IN nllt- o HleSe is It'-Vif SCO save In the neighborhood of temples where thi y are artificially protected; and even here it takes all the watch and care fot the tree-loving priest to prevent their destruction. Il.c-h family, each community. w lu re there is no common care i xercised In the In b lest of ail of tin m to pre Vent dr. foi -.-station, finds Its prollt in the Im mediate use of the fuel which would otherwise bo used by some other fam ily or some other community. In the total absence of regulation of th matter in the Interest of the whole people, each small group Is Inevitably pushed into a policy of dest t uct'on which ran not afford to take thought for the morrow. This is just one of those matters whiih it is fatal to have to un uperviseel indivblual con trol. The fore.-ts, can only be pro tected i,y the state, ijy the nation; and the liberty of ni tion of individ uals must be cnnditii'iied upon what the state or nat:on determine to be iiecesaiy for the common s if. ty. The lesson of deforestation in China is a lesson which mankind should have learned many times jil reaily from nh.it has occurred in olln r places. I leiiiidalieii leave naked soil; then gailying cuts iln.vn to tln ban; rock; and meanwhile the rock-waste buries the bottom lands When toesoll Is gone, men must go, and the process does not lake lomi. This rutihle.-s destruction ot th forests in northern China his brought -about, or has aided in bring ing anoul. Ju-t as the destruction ol the forests in cintral Asna aid in bringing ruin to the once l ie li ci n tral Asian cities; Just as the destruc tion of the forents In north' in Africa helped towards the ruin of a leg on that niin a fertile granary in Iloman days. Shortsighted man, whether barbaric, semi-clvili.ed, or what he mistakenly regards as fully civilzed. w hen he has destroyed the for. sis has rendered certain the ultimate de struction of tlie land itself. In north ern China the mountains are such u. are shown by the ucenmptining pho tographs, absolutely barren peaks Xot only have the fori sts been de stroyed, but because of their destruc tion the soli has b n washed oil the; naked rock. The terrible! conse quence is that it i Impossible now to undo the damage that has been done. .Many centuries would have to pass before .soil would again collect, ir could be made to collect. In suffi cient quantity once more to support the old-time forest grow th. In c n sequence the Mongol ib Sei t is prac tically extending eastward ov r northern China. The climate has changed and i still changing. It has changed e ven within the last half century, as the work of tree destr uc tion has been consummated. The great masses of urboreal vegetation on the mountains formerly ausorbsd the hint of the sun and sent up cur rents of cool air which oroug.it th moisture-laden clouds lower and forced them to precipitate in rain a part of their burden of watc-. Xow that there Is no vegetation, the barren mountains, scorched by thu sun, send up currents of heuted uir which drivo away instead of attract ing the rain clouds, and cause their moisture to be disseminated. In consequence, instead of the regular and plentiful ruin which existed li these regions of China when tho for- Ls were still In evidence, the lin loriunaij innaoitants or tlie deforest- I ed lands now see their crops withi r for lack of rainfall, while the sea sons grow more and more Irregular; and as the air becomes dried certain crops refuse lunger to grow at a'l. That everything dries out faster than formerly is shown by tho fact that the level of the wells all over' the land has sunk perceptibly, manv of them having become totally dry. In addition to the resulting agilculturnl distress, the w atercoursi s have changed. Formerly they were narrow and deep, with an abundance of ch ar water the year around; for the roots lid humus of the forests caught t If: ruin water and lot It escape by low, regular s. epage. Tiny have now be come broad, shallow stream hods, in which muddy water trlckbx in :. len der currents during tlie dry Reasons, while when it rains there are fresh ets, und roaring muddy torrents come tearing down, bringing disaster and destruction everywhere. Mori-ov-r, these floods and frcuhets. which di versify the general dryness. waih away from thu mountain sides, and either wash away or cover In the vul- ys. the rich fertile soil which It took t-us eif tlious,in.n of years f r nature to form; und it ds lost for ever, and until the forests grow again it cannot 1m: replaced. The sand 'and stom-.s fr om the mountain slib s are washed loose: and come rolling down to cover trie arable land-", and in consequence, throughout this part of China, many formerly rich dl-trlcts arc now sandy wastes, useless for human cultivation and even for pas ture. The cities have been of c mrse seriously al'I'ecteil, for the streams have gradually ceased to be naviga ble. There Is testimony that even within the memory of men now liv ing there has been a s rl ms diminu tion of the rainfall of northeastern China. Tin: level of the Sung.iri river In northern Manchuria has been sensibly lowered duiing the last fifty years, at bust part'y as the re- su't or the indiscriminate euiting of the forests forming its watershed Almost all the rivers of northern China, have become iineonti-ollabb' and yerw dangerous to thu dwell,-; s along their banks, as direct result or the destruction of 111" forests. The Journey from I'ekln to Je-hol shows in melancholy fashion how the soil has been washed away from whole valleys, so that they have In en con verted Into deserts. In norilieru China this disa-ti'om process has gone on so long am has proceeded So far that no complete remedy cnuld be applied. There are certain mountains in China from wiilt.-h the soil has gone so utterly that only the slow action of the ages uU again restore It; although of course much could be none to pre vent the Mill further eastward e.v- l onion of the Mongolian desert if the Chinese government would a 't at once. The a company mg eu's from photograph show- i tie Incon ceivable desolation of t!iebarren mountains In which certain r ivers rise -mountains, be it r bei..-, I which formerly ui'eVl"d Vtlles eieni V dens" forest of larches and Ills, now unable to produce any wood, and be cause of their condition a soiree of danger to the hole eonnliy. Th l!i it - ot i n phs also show the same riv ers niter they have passed through the mountains, the beds having be come lirond slid saiuly because of the ib for. station of the mountains. One of the plioto'j;r,-i phs shows a car avan pass Hi; through a valley. I-Vr-lnerly, when the mountains were for ested, It was thickly p- opled by pros perous peasants. Now tht floods have i-airl d destruction all over th land and the valley is n nt 'iiy deeit. Another photoionph shows a moun tain road covered with the stones and rocks thai are brought down li the ra'ny s-i asori from the mountains which have already bei n d forest- d by human hands. Another shows a p bbly liver-bed In southern Mao-cli-iria where whut was once a great stream has dried up owini to the de forestation In the mountains. Only some scrub wood i left, which will disnppiar within a half century. Yet another shows the iffeet of one of (he washouts, ilestroyinjr no nrah'e mountain side, these wash oils b' iir.: due to the removal of all veg-ctnti m; yet in this photograph the foreground Mhows that reforestation Is still a possibility in places. What has thus happened in north ern China, what has happened 'n Ceniral Asia, in riilotine, in North Africa. In part, of the Mediterranean countries of liui-ope, will surely hap pen in our country if we do not ex ercise that wise forethought whl-'i should be one of tire chief marks of any people calling itself rivilizi Nothing should be permitti d to stand in the way of the preservation of the forests, and it is criminal to permit individuals to purchase a little gain for IhemselveH through the destruc tion or forests when tills destruction Is fatal to the Weill, cinjr of the whole I country in the future. Inland uterwin s. Action should bo begun forw ith, during the present session ot th Cougres.. for the Improvement of our inland waterways uctltm whlh win rmun in giving us not only nav igable but navigated rivers. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollare upon these waterways, yet tho traf lle on nearly all of them Is steadily declining. This condition is the di rect recult of the absence of any comprehensive and far-seeing plan rf watorway Improvement. Obviously we can not continue thus to expend the revenues of the government without return. It is poor business to spend money for Inland naviga tion unlcs we get it. Inquiry into the condition of th Mississippi and its principal tribu taries reveals the very many In stances of the utter waste caused by the methods which have hitherto ob tained for the so-called "improv mcnt" of navigation. A striking in stance Is supplied by the "Improve ment." of the Ohio, which begun in 124, was continued under a singl : p'an for half a century. In 1.S75 n new plan was adopted and followed for a quarter of u century. In 1!I02 stiil a different plan wua adopted and has since been pursued nt a rat' which only promises a navigable rlvi r In from twenty to one hundred yeais longer. Such shortsighted, vacillating and futile methods are neeompanied liv decreasing- water-b u ne. commerce and increaiing trnftle engestl in on land, by increasing floods, and i.y the waste of public money. The remedy lies In abandoning the meth ods which have .so signally failed and adopting now ones in keeping with the needs and demands of our people. In a report on a measure Intro duced at the lirst session or the pn s- lit Congress, the secretary or war said: "The chief defects in the meth ods hitherto pursued lies in the ab sence of executive authority for or ganiang comprehensive plans cover lug the country or natural divl-ions thcreof." concur, only fail hut tluy IIH well, maic-nt lu this opinion i hi art! y The present methods not to give us inland navigation, are Injurious to the army What is virtually a per detail of tlie corps of ell- gineeis to civilian duty necessarly impairs the elliciency or our mili tary establishment. The military e i giiieers have undoubtedly done i f I cleiit work in -actual construction, 'at they are necessarily unsiiited by their training and traditions to take the broad view, and to gather and tran mit to the Congress the commercial and Industrial information and f r- -easts, upon which waterway improve ment must always so largely rest. I'uith gra.- p every sou rci rrnore. they have failed in I he sn ut. underlying fai l that stream is a unit from is to its mouth, and that all Its uses ire independent. Prominent oN liccis or tlie engineer corps have re cently even gone so far us to assert in print that waterways are not d -pendent upon the conservation of the forests about their headwateis. Th's position Is opposed to ull the recent work or tin: scientific bureaus of the govei nm. nt and to the general expe'-- ienr f mankind. A physician who disbelieved in vaccination would n it be the right m.ui to handle an e-p -denilc of smallpox, nor should we leave a doctor skeptical about the tranmiission of yellow fever by th" St' gomyU niosijiilio in charge of sanitation at Havana or Panama. S with the improvement of our river; it Is no longer wise and safe to leave th's gr. at.work in the hands of men who fail to grasp the essential rela tions between navigation and g -n-ernl development and to as-duil'atc and use the central facts abuut our stream.". t'ntil the work of river improve ment Is undertaken in a modern vay is can not have results that nii-i t the needs of this modem tlon. These needs should be with. nit further dilly-dallying or lay. Tlie plan which promises will na- Illct d - the best and quickest results Is that of a pormi nt commission uuthoil.ed to I g-'Vi wati ise slve coordinate the wank Turnout departments erwajs. and to frame. the execution of a p an. Coder such a ol' all the relsting o und up- r conii relii-n-c ouniission the actual work of construction might be intrusted to the reclama tion service; or to the military en gineers acting willi suflicbMit iiiiiii- her of civilians to cont'nun tho work in time of war; or It might be di vided between the reclamation ser vice and the ei)ri- of engineerp. Funds should be provided from cui P nt revenues if It Is deemed w ise otherwise from u,,. of bond'. The essential thing is that the win k should go forward nailer the best pisssiole plan, and with the bast piMslble delay. We should have n new type of work and n new organi sation for planning, nnd directing it. The time for playing with our water ways Is past. The count' y demands results.. National Parks. 1 urge tliHt all our nat'onal parki adjacent to national forests be plac ed completely under the control of the forest service of the agricultural department. nst"Rd of leaving them lis they now are. under the Interbr department and policiod by 'he army. The Congress should provide for superintendents with adequate Icorps of lirst-elass civilian scoutw, or i angers, and further, place the mad construction under the superin tendent im-tind ,r h living It wl'h the war department. Such a change in park management would result In economy and avoid the dlfllculties or administration which now arls from having the responsibility if care and prot'-ctliun divided be tween different departments. The need for this course is peculiarly great In the Yellowstone- Park. This, like the Yoseir.fte, Is a great wonder land, and should be kept ns a nation al playground, in both nil wild things should be protected, nnd tho scenery kept wholly unmarred. I am hnppy to say that I have boon able to .set aside in various parts of the country small, woll-chosen tracts of ground to serve as sanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures. Ih'iialurcil Alcohol. 1 had occasion in my message of I May -I. 11100, to urge tile passage "f 1 some law putting alcohol, used In the acts. Industries, and manufac tures, upon the free list; that is. to I provide for the withdrawal free f I lax of alcohol which is to be de natured for those purposes. The law oT June 7, 11106, und Its amendment of March 2. 1UU7, accomplished what I vva! desired In that respect, and tho use of denatured alcohol, as intended is making a fair degree ot progress and is entitled to further encourage ment and support from the Co.. grcts. Inrt 1'ood. The pure food legislation has al ready worked a benefit difficult to overestimate. Indian Service. It has be'n my put pose Trom the beginning of my administration to take the Indian service completely out of the atmosphere ol political ac tivity, and there has been st'-udy progress toward that end. Tho :ast remaining stronghold of politics !h that service was the agency system, which has pcen Its best days und was gradually falling to pieces from natural or yurely evolutionary cau.se:-, but, like ull such survivals, was decaying slowly in Its later stages. It seemi char that lta ex tinction had bettur be made final now, so that the ground can be cleared for larger constructive work on behalf of the Indians, preparatory to their induction into the full meas ure of responsibly citizenship. On November 1 only eighteen agcn.ies were left on the rter; with two ex ceptions, where some legal questions seemed to stand temporarily In the way. these have been changed superintendencles, and their h. ads brought intj the classified civil ser vice. Secret Service. l-i8t year an amendment was In corporated In the measure, provid ing for the secret .service, which pro vided that there should be no d' ail from the secret service -and no trans fer therefrom. It It not too much to say that this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of ben efit only, to the criminal classes. If deliberately Introduced for the pur pose of diminishing the effectiveness of war against crime it could not have been better devised to this end. It forbade the practice that hive been followed to a greater or less extent by the executive Iliads of various departments for twenty years. To these practices we owe the securing of the evidence whl h enabled us to drive gnat lott lies out of business und secure a quar ter of a million of dollars in fines from their, promoters. These prac tices have enabled us to dlscovi r some of the mst outrageous frauds lu connection with the theft of gov ernment land and government timber by gnat corporations and by indi viduals. These practices have enabled us to get some of the evidence in dispensable In order to secure the conviction of tho wealthiest and most formidable criminals with whom the government bus to deal, both these operntiirg ill viol iti Ml of the anti-trust law and others. The amendment In question wus of bine fit to no one excepting to these criminals, and It seriously hampers the government In the detection of ciline and the securing of justice. Moreover, It not only affects depart ments outside of the treasury, but It tends to hamper the secretary of the treasury himself In the erroit to uti lize the employes of bis depart ment so us to best meet the require, merits of the public to-rviic. It for bids him from preventing Hands upon the customs service, from in vestigating irregularities in brjn'h mints and us.uy offices, and has hit lously crippbd him. It prevents the promotion of employes in the secret service, and this further discourages good erfort. In its present form the restriction operates onto to tlie al vantage of the criminal, or tho wrongdoer. The chief argument in favor of the provision was that tlie congressmen did not themtelves wisli to be investigated by secret service mi a. Very little of such Investiga tion has been done in the past; but it is true thut the work of tin- secret service agents u .n partly responsi ble for the indictment and convicton of a senator and a emigres. man f r land frauds in iirogo.-. I do not be lieve thut il is in the public interest to protect criminals In any branch of h" public service, und exactly as we have again aad uain during the past M'vcn years prosecuted nnd convicted such criminals who wcr in the executive branch of the gov eminent, so in my belief we nhould be given ample means to prosecut them if found In the legislative brunch. Uut If this is not considered desirable a special exception could be made In the law prohibiting- the use of the secret service force In In vestigating members of the Congres--. It would be far better to do this than to do what actually was done und strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action against crim Inals by the executive branch of th government. P'Mul Savings Itniik. I again renew my recommenda tion for postal savings banks, to depositing; savings with the security of the government behind them. Th" ob.iect ls to encourage thrift and economy In the wage-earner and person of moderate means. In four teeri .states the deposits in savings banks ils reported to the comptrol ler of th currency amount to :i..'i!io,i I."., 4i.i2. or s. 4 per cunt of the entire deposits, while In the remain ing 32 states there arc only $70. SOM..43. or 1.6 per rent, Hhjwlng con clusively that there are many lo ali ties In the United States where suf ficient opportunity Is not given t the people to deposit their savings, The rc.-:ult Is that money Is kept In hiding nnd unemployed.. It Is b' - Moved that In the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought in to circulation through the Instru mentality of the postal savings banks. While there are only 1,411 savings banks reporting to the comp troller there are more than 61,000 postoffices, 40.000 of which are money order offices. Postal savings banks are now In operation In prac tically all the great civilized coun tries with the exception of the United States. Ilieccl Post. In my last annual message 1 com mended the postmaster general's recommendation for an extension of Iho pureel post on the rural routed. The establishment of a local pureed post on rural rout's would bo to the mutual benefit of tlie furmer and thu country storekeeper, and it U desir able that the routes, serving more than 13,000.000 people, should be utilized to the fullest practicable ex tent. An amendment was proposed In the Senate at the last session, at the suggestion of the postmaster general, providing that, for the pnr poso of ascertaining the practicabili ty of establishing a special local par cel post fystem on the rural routes throughout the United States, tin poMtmastor-general be authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress the result of such experiment-by establishing a special lo cal parcel post system on rural de livery routes in not to exceed four counties In the United States for packages of fourth-class matter or iginating on a rural route or at the distributing post office for delivery by rural carriers. It would peem on ly proper that uch an experiment should bo tried in order to demon strate tho practicability of the prop osition, especially as the postmaster general estimates that the revenue derived from, the operation of such a system on all the rural routes would amount to many million dol lars. I Id ileal ion. 1 he share- that the national gov ernment should take In thu broa 1 work of education has not receivod tho attention and tlie capo it rightly deserves. The Immediate responsi bility for the support and improve ment of our educational systems and Institutions rests and should always rest with the people of the several states acting through their state and local governments, but the nation has an opportunity in education work which must not be lost and a duty which nhould no longer be neg lected. The National llurcau of Kducatlon was established more: than forty years ago. Its purpose Is to co lect and diffuse such information "as shall aid the people of the United .states in the establishment and main tenance of efficient .school systems and otherwise promote the cause of education throughout the country." This purpose in uo way conflicts with the educational work of the states, but may be made of great advantage to the states by giving them the fullest, most accurate, und hence- the most helpful informal Inn and sug gestion regarding tin- be.-t educa tional systems. The nation, through Its broader field of activities. Hi wider opportunity for obtaining In formation from all the mates and from foreign countries. Is u'olc to do that which not even the richest states can do. and with tlie distinct additional advantages that the Infor mation thus obtained is used for the Immediate benefit of all our people. With the limited means hitherto provided, tho bureau of education has rendered efficient service, but the Congrcs-s has neglected to ade quately supply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth of th" country, Tlie appro prlalioius for the1 general work of the .bureau, outside education in Alaska, for the year l'.lOD are but $87,000 an amount less than tiny were ten years ago. and some of the impottant less than they were thirty years ago. it is un inexcusible waste of public money to appropriate an amount which mi inaduquat" as to make it Impossible properly to do the work authorised, and it Is unfair to the great educullonal inti retts of th'j country to deprive them of the value of the results which can b? obtained by proper appropriations. I earnestly recommend that th's unfortunate state of affair as re gards the national educational office be remedied by adiiuate appropria tions. This recommendation is urged by the representatives of our com mon schools and great state univer sities and the leading educator, who all unite In requesting favorable con sideration and action by the Con gress upon this subject. Census. I strongly urge that f e request of the director of the census In con nection with the decennial work J soon to be began, be complied with and that the appointments to the census force be pl.wed under the civil service law, waiving the geo graphical requirements us requested by the director of the censu. The supervisors and enumerators should not be appointed under Ihe civil Ser vice law, for the reasons given by the director. I recommend to the Congress the cureful consideration of the admirable report of the director of the census,' und I trust that hU recommendations will be adopted and Immediate action thereon taken. Public Health. It Is highly advisable that there should he Intelligent nctlon on the part of the nation on the question of preserving the health of the country. Through the practical extermination In San Francssco of diseuse-bearl lg rodents our country has thus far es caped the bubonic piagu-. This Is but one of the many achievements or American health officers; and 1. shows what can be accomplished with a better organization than ut pre win Mists. The dangers to I no lle health from food adulteratioi und from many other sources, such as the menace to the physical, men tal and moral developim ut of child ren from child labor, should be m.-t and overcome. There are numerous diseases, which are now known to bo preventable, which are, neverthe less, not prevented. The recent In ternational Congress on tuberculosis has made us painfully aware of the Inadequate American public health legislation. The nation can not af ford to lag behind in the world-wide battle now- being waged by ail civil ised people with tho microscopic foes of mankind, nor ought we long er to Ignore the reproach that tills government takes more pains to pro tect the fives of hogs and of cuttle than of human beings. The first I'-ffWIatlve step to be taken Is that for tha concentration of the proper bunaus Into one of the existing de partments. I therefore urgently re commend the passage of a bill which shall authorize a redistribution at the bureaus which ehull best ac complish this end. ;vei'iiiiicnt Printing flh'c, I recommend that legislation be enacted placing under the Jurisdic tion of the depurtment of commerce and laoor tlie government printing office. At present this office is un der the combined control, supervi sion, and administrative direction of the president and of the Joint com mittee on printing of the two houses of the Congress. The advantage of having the 4.069 employees in this office and the expenditure of the $3,7(1 1.377.37 appropriated therefor supervised by an executive depart mi nt is obvious, instead of the pre- sd combined supervision. Soldiers' Homes. Alt soldiers' homes should be placed under the complete Jurisdic tion und control of the war depart ment. Independent Bureiias and Coininis,. nlons. Euutiiiniy and sound business poli cy require that all existing Indepen dent bureaus and commissions ihould 'be placed under the Jurisdlc Uoa of uppropriuto executive de partments.. It Is unwise from every Jtenrtpolnt. and results only In mis chief, to hae any executive work uotii save by the purely executive bodies, under the control of the pres ident; und each uch executive body should be under the Immediate su pervision of a cabinet minister. Statehood. I advocate the Immediate admis sion of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of the Congress. The people of the two territories have made It evident by their votes that they will not come in as onu state. The only alternative Is to admit them us two, und I trust that this will be done without delay. Interstate l's)-iios, I call the attention of tlie Cou gri - to the Importance of thu prob lem of toe fisheries in the Interstate waters. On the iircat Lakes We arc now, under the very wise treaty of April 11th of this year, endeavoring to come to an International agree ment for the preservation and satis factory use of the fisheries of these waters which can not otherwise be achieved. Iike Uric, for example, has the richest fresh water fisheries in the world; but it is now con trolled oy the statutes of two na tions, four states, and one province, and it; this province bv different or dinances in different cJuntii. All these political divisions work at cross purposes, and In no case can they achieve protection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and justice to the localities and individual on the other. The case is similar in Pug'-t Sound. Hut the problem is guile pressing In the interstate, wate rs of the Unite 1 States. The salmon fisheries of the Columbia river are now but a frac tion of what they were tweiity-flve yea in ago, and what they would be now If the United States govern ment hud taken complete charge of them, by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-live years the fishermen of euch state have naturally tried to take ull tiny could get, and the two legislatures have never been able o agree on joint action of uiiy kind adequate lu degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the tlsblng on the Oregon j-ide is piuc tieally closed, while there is no limit on tlie Washington side, of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide us to the very statutes under which this action and nonac tion result. Meanw hile very f e jv salmon reuclt ihe spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will uniount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle be tween the associated, or gill-nct. fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river. The fisheries of the Missis sippi ,the Ohio, and the Potomac are also In a bad way. For this there Is no remedy except for the Unite I Slates to control und legislate for the Interstate fisheries as part of the business of interstate commerce. In this ease tho machinery for seienUfie investigation and for control already exists In the United states bureau of fisheries. In this us in similar prob lems the obvious und simple rule should be followed of having those matters which uo particular mat'' ran manage taken In hand by th United Wtate.; problems, which 11 the seesaw of conflicting state legis lature are absolutely unsolvablc, nro easy enough for the Congress to con trol. I'NIicrlos and I'ur Seals." The federal statute regulating In terstate trafric in game should be extended to Include fish. New fed eral fish hatcheries should be es tablished. The administration of th Aluskan fur-seal service should bt vested In the bureau of fisheries. Foreign Affairs. Tills nation' foreign polity It bused ''on the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between Individuals, and In our actions for the last ten years w have In this matter proven our faith by our deed. We have behaved, and are behaving, towards other na tions, as in private 1 i f - un honorable man would behave towards hiri fol lows. l ulln- Amei lean Kepu biles. The commercial und material pro- jgrcss of Die twenty Latln-Amerkan repuolics Is worthy of the careful at tention of the Congress, So other section of the world has hown a greater proportionate development of its foreign trade during the lust tun years and none other has mora special cluims on the lute-rest of tho United States. t offers today proV ably larger opportunitii s for the le gitimate expansion of our commerce than any other group of countries. These countries will want our pro ducts In greatly increased quantities and we liull correspondingly in el theirs. The international llurcau of the American Republics Is doing a useful work in making these nations and their resources better known to us, and in acquainting thent not only with us as u people and wilh our purposes towards them, but with what we have to exchange for their goods. It is in International Insti tution supported by ull the govern ments of the two Americas. Panama Canal. Tlie work on the I'unuma canal is Ibelng donei iwlth a speed, efficiency and entire devotion to duty, which make it a model for all work of the kind. X) task of ttuch magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any nation; und no task of the kind has ever been better performed. Th men on the Isthmus, from Colonel Gocthals and his fellow commission ers through the entire list of em ployes who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their right to tne ungrudging respect and gratitude of the American people. Derail .Mail Line's. 1 ugain recommend the extension of the ocean mail uct of 1801 so that satisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America. Asia, tho Philippines and Australasia may be. estaolished. The creation of tuch, . steamship lines should be tho natural corollary of the voyage of tho battle fleet. It should precede thu open'ng of tiie Panama canal. Uvea under favorable conditions several yearn must elapse before t-ueh lines can bo put into operation. Accordingly I urge that the Congress act promptly where foresight ulrcady shows that Action sooner or luter wlll.be lno.lt ublu. "' Hawaii. I cull particular attention to tho territory of llawuil. Thu Importance of those ibluiicLs is apparent, und thu need of improving their conditio and developing their resources is urgent. In recent years Industrial conditions upon tho islands have radically changed. The importation of coolie labor has practically ceased, and there is now developing t-uc'.i a diversity In agricultural product as to make possible a change In the land conditions of thu territory, so that un opportunity may be given, to thu small land owner similar to that to the mainland. To uld these changes, the national government must provide the necessary huibur improvements on euch Island, so that the agricultural products can bo car ried to the markets of the world. The coastwise shipping luws should bu amended to meet the speeiul liceda of thu Islands, -and tiiu alien contract la bor law should be o inodiiied In iU application to Hawaii us to enablo Amorleuii and European labor to b orought thither. Wc have begun to improve Feurl harbor for a naval base and to pro vide the nccevssary military fortifica tions for the protection of tho Islands, but 1 cannot too strongly emphu.dzo the need of appropriations for thejo purposes of such un umount as will within the shortest possible time make those islands practically im pregnable. It is uselesi to develop the Industrial conditions of tho is lands und establish there bases of supply for our naval und mercliaut fleets uulcsvs we Insure, a far us hu man ingenuity can, their sufety from foreign seizure. One thing to ibe remembered with all our formications Is thut it Is al most useless to make them Impreg nable from the m-u if they are lett open to land uttack. This Is trun even of our own cou.s.t, but it is doubly true of our Insular posses sions. In Hawaii, for instance, it U worse than useless to establish it behind fortillcations jo strong tint no landing force can take them save by regular und long-continued skgo operaions.
