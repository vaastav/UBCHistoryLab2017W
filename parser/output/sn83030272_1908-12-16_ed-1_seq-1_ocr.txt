Vsiinoio DN 15 Detplte what was diagnosed last week as 1 pronounced case of cold feet on the part of Congress the national legislature according to declarations of leaders in both branches is determined to administer a rebuke to President Roosevelt for his strictures on Congressmen in that part of his recent message bearing on the activity of the Secret Service of the United State Further If present intentions are car ried out the operations of the Secret Service may b made the subject of a careful inquiry Congrosa committee The very suggestion of such an investi gation has created I good deal of a stir In Washington as the Secret Service in the last fow years has done various odd jobs ranging from the important work of running down land sharks to collecting evidence of 1 highly salacious character in divorce cases I What appears to be delay by the Senate and House in acting in this matter is nothing more or loss than the deliberation which accompanies the consideration of Iccmpnll o sderaton Important questions 8 the leaders say The rebuke to the Executive will bo digni fied and temperate in tone but before anything is done at all each houso wants to get a clear idea in advance just what action is to bo taken by the other Within the next few days It is expected 1 resolution of censure will b offered in the Senate The House has already taken the first step in this direction I select committee having been named for the purpose of making a report recom mending appropriate action Just who will offer the resolution in the Senate h not yet been determined Senator Halo of Maine and Senator Burrows of Michigan are said to willing and one of them in all probability will bo selected for the task Senator Dilllngham ha consented to undertake i a The select committee appointed by the House held another long session today but with what result Is not known The aunouncement was made that a meeting would be held tomorrow and it was In timated that some Interesting develop ments might follow Members are annoyed over the reports that Congress was willing to back out of what was now regarded as a predica ment fearing that Mr Roosevelt would return to the attack with disclosures that would make It seriously embarrassing ing for Congress This is the substance of a statement made by two committee men today one of them a Democrat and the other a Republican The Househas a duty to perform In this matter and it will act You may b sure of that There is nothing significant in the delay of the committee in making a report We ore making haste slowly i is absurd even to suggest that after the How had taken cognizance of the Presidents insulting message by ap pointing a committee to guide it In taking appropriate action there would be a approprt acton thought of abandoning the proceedings The chances are that we will report before the holidays and I have no doubt the re port will bo adopted The Interesting development of the day In the Secret Service imbroglio has ta d the detective force of the Treasury Department The Secret Service has Investigated Congressmen and now It If suggested Cqngress should make I careful inquiry into the activities of thl Secret Service If such action were taken it would undoubtedly intensify th bitter feeling that already exists between the executive and the legislative That inch an inquiry Is entertained seriously by some Senators and many Representa tives is not questioned LGtERS
