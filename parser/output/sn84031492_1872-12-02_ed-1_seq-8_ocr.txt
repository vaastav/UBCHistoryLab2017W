WASHINGTON. What t&e President Touches on in Bis Message. He Thinks the Taxes Should Not Be Reduced. The Country’s Finances in a Favorable and Satisfac tory Condition. The Estimates for the Fiscal fear, 1573-4. THE MESSAGE. Washington, D. C., Dec. I.—The President’s message has been transcribed, and will he sent to the Capitol for presentation to the two Houses between 12 and 1 o’clock. The message is longer than the last one, and the reading of it will take nearly an hour. On the subject of Finance he refers to the re port of Secretary Ecutwell, and says he does not believe that tho taxes ought to he much farther reduced; that the present income is required for the payment of the debt, the interest on tho bonds, and tho current running expenses of the Government, He regards the finances as in a very satisfactory and favorable condition, and hopes, with the present prosperity, and with wise legislation, the time is not far distant when the currency of the country will he ad justed to a specie basis. Ho speaks in terms of praise of the extensive improvements in the District of Columbia, and urges upon Congress liberal appropriations, to enable the work to go on. Washington becomes worthy of being the Capital of the Nation. He makes no recommendation regarding the Internal Revenue Bureau, but it is known that he favors the bill proposed at the Treas ury Department, winch abolishes tho offices cf Assessor and Assistant Assessor of Internal Revenue. Ho asks the special attention of Con gress to the report of the Postmaster General on the matter of postal telegraphy, but he makes no recommendation on the subject. He discusses at considerable length our rela tions with Spain and the Island of Cuba, grets that no advance has been made toward a settlement of the difficulties between that coun try and the United States. He regards tho trouble in Cuba as largely due to tho existence of slavery in that island, and hopes that the es tablishment of amicable relations willnotbelong delayed, Much space in the message is devoted to the critical condition of affairs on the Mex- ican border, and asks the attention of Congress to the report of the Commissioners and to the subject generally. No mention whatever will bo made in the message of tho old project to an nex Santo Domingo. am. 

COLFAX. Vice President Colfax arrived here this morn- ing, and has taken quarters at Wormley’s. His wife, on account of delicate health and their re cent affliction, will spend but a short time in tho city during the winter, and will not arrive until January. Mr. Colfax thinks the session will he a quiet one, and that there will be little if any bitterness between parties. 

GENERAL BANKS also arrived here this-morning. He says ho has not announced any intention of resigning the Chairmanship of the Foreign Committee, and that he has never given a thought to the subject. He says he has written no letter, and will be guided by circumstances. CIVIL SERVICE. The larger portion of the Senators and Repre sentatives are here to-night, and the leading ho tels, so long deserted, are crowded to their ut most capacity. The leading Congressmen seem to be uniformly impressed with the conviction that the session winch begins to-morrow will bo one of the dullest on record. Theleading topics xriuch are uppermost in the minds of all who have arrived relate to tho Postal Telegranh echeme and Civil Service Reform. On the latter subject, several of the most distinguished mem bers, such as Morton. Wilson, Lo"an and Wmdom, of the Senate, and Dawes, Gar field, and Chesterfield, of the House, had a Ion" and serious consultation with the President on Saturday; and to tho conflicting views which were offered, tho President simply had the reply to moke, tnat eo long as the law imposed upon him the Civil Service rules and regulations, ho felt compelled to stand by and enforce them. Those who are opposed to this reform are a main annamont with tho President, though, in the absence of other issues, its adoption will cause a dissension in the Republican party far more serious than any which has yet threatened ite organization. A careful canvass of the members already here indicate that the sentiment in favor of this reform has largely increased since last winter. Members are beginning to find out that the new regnjarion relieves them of an immense amount < l importunity from their office-seeking constit v. jind. Some of the members still adhere to the tp.nicu that the new system is not popular with ' people, and assert that the last election was a clear and positive verdict against it. 

POSTAL TELEGRAPHY. On the Postal Telegraphic scheme Congress men. so far as a decided opinion is concerned, are fully as much at sea as one year ago. The points in the report of the Postmaster General cn this subject, and which work to an absolute ownership by the Government of a telegraphic system, have been largely discussed to-day. The Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Dawes, does not think- the country is yet prepared or ready for this scheme. Ho does not know hut that ho would _ give his support to some such intermediate plan as would con template Government ownership of the tele graph, but to be operated through the agency of a private company, so as to prevent a large increase of Government office-holders. It is but a fair statement to say that but few mem bers really have any practical ideas on this sub ject. Those who have paid it anv attention such as Palmer, Farnsworth, Hubbard, Garfield! aud Dawes, differ very widely both on the # mam points and details. The at tention which the House Appropriations Committee has already paid the subject has not resulted in anything tangible. Something is looked for in the President’s message. to-mor row, which, together with the Postmaster Gen eral’s report, will give some practical direction to tho agitation on this subject. Palmer’s bill, which has heretofore been published in the de spatches. with some modifications or addition, will he tho first one introduced on this subject. The more experienced members of the House are of the opinion that all the legislation that can bo procured on this subject will merely be the appointment of a commission to collate statistics, and that in any event Con gress would only sanction such a scheme which, while contemplated ownership of tho lines, would simply regulate the rates of messages, and then let tho work out to be bid for as . other Government contracts. 

APFE OPHIATTON* PILES. The regular Appropriation Dills will be ready to be reported on tbo first working day of the session. General Garfield will take the floor to morrow after the reading of the journal, to have each bill reported fixed as a special order. THE OEE3UNO DAY. The Republican Senators will hold their cau cus at about 2 o’clock to-morrow. The Senate will organize at noon, with the Tice ’ the chair, when the ro"' 1 " appointed are strongly to ravor ot investigating the Credit Mobiher scandal for the credit of their State. THE CHICAGO BANK 6. Comutroller Knox has a paragraph, in his an nual report, relating to the effect of the Chicago S r ?w? on -. th -?^ ailkfl of thai cifc y* After showing that the buildings occupied by tho eighteen Na tional Banks there were totally destroved, he at the Treasury De partment, that three banks were so seriously crippled that they would he unable to resume business, and the proposition was seriously rnaae, at one time, to compromise with their -y. payment of their liabilities in installments. * The Comptroller compliments xns predecessor with avoiding any serious finan cial disturbances by the wise and discreet policy ho inaugurated. Instead of balances being drawn upon, balances began to flow in so freely that, at the close of the first day’s business after the fire, it was found that tho receipts were so largely in excess of the disbursements that confidence was at once restored. The total loss arising from the fire on discounted paper is estimated at $600,000, and tho loss from the de struction of bank' buildings, furniture, and fix frires at $176,000. The banks, at the time of the fire, had accumulated a surplus fund exceeding one-fourth of their aggregate capital, and had at their command a reserve ecmal to more than 80 per cent of their liabilities, and were, therefore, enabled to resume business without embarrass ment. The wisdom of the section of tho act re quiring this accumulation and the holding of the reserve is thus especially instanced. TREASURY MOVEMENTS, Washington, D. C., Dec. I.—The Secretary of tho Treasury has authorized the Assistant Treasurer at New York to purchase $1,000,000 of bonds each Wednesday, and to sell $1,000,000 of gold each Thursday during .tho month of Decem ber. APPROPRIATIONS, Tho House Committee on Appropriations, which has been in session two weeks, has per fected tho legislative, executive, and judicial Appropriation hills, the Indian Appropriation hill, the Consular and Diplomatic bill, the Pen sion bill, and the Post Office Ax)propriation bill, which will he reported to tho House early this week. GETS ms CHARACTER. The President has written a letter to General Horace Porter, accepting his resignation, 'in which he recognizes his great services, both in a military and civil capacitj’, and wishes him suc cess in his new field of labor. The estimates for the fiscal year 1873-74 are : Legislative Establishment $2,973,274 Executive Establishment 17,129,201 Judicial Establishment 3,587,050 Foreign Intercourse:...* 1,320,754 Military Establishment 32,894,854 Naval Establishment 20,154,220 Indian Affairs 5,700,975 Pensions 80,500,000 ‘Public Works 29,057,345 Postal Service 7,410.602 Miscellaneous 9,590,674 Bennancnt appropriation $147,361,943 Total $308,823,250 Tho estimates exceed tho appropriations for tho present fiscal year in consequence of tho increase of ten millions in the amount for public works. The probabilities are against granting this increase, and that the aggregate, therefore, will fall below the amount appropriated for the cur rent fiscal year, which is $299,414,428. 

POLITICAL. THE GREELEY ELECTORAL VOTE. New Yobs, Dec. I.—The Tribune of to-morrow will contain a brief editorial article reciting the various propositions which have been made for casting the Greeley elec toral votes for Charles Francis Adams, or some one of the other candidates before the Cincinnati Convention, for Gratz Brown or fer Grant. It quotes from the very last article written by Mr. Greeley in tho Tribune , his counsel to*thc South to accept the situation, and his declaration that he is well assured that the chief victors in the late struggle are inclined to correct the abuses and satisfy the just complaints of the South to tho extent of their power. It inquires whether it would not be a legitimate deduc tion from this, liia last earthly coun sel, that his votes might appropri ately be cast for Grant. It holds that such a course would help to lift the next Administration out of partisanship, and by giving it its election from tho whole people, mike it freer to sccuro such reforms in the Administration, both South and North, as are clearly needed, but have been hitherto resisted by partisan nesessitios. It thinks, however, in this case, that Gratz Brown should receive the Electoral vote for Vice Presi dent. Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune, New York, Dec. I.—The Times' editorial says: “Mr. Greeley’s death is likely to call public at tention to the dangerously-indirect method by which the President is chosen. If at any time the person in whose name the majority of the Electors was chosen should die in the interval be tween the voting day and the day fixed for the meeting of Electors, it is easy to see that, by the arts of professional politicians acting upon a small body of men, a notoriously unfit person might be foisted upon the nation as Chief Mag istrate. The only obvious and certain way to avoid risks which would attend such a contin gency would be to vote directly for President and Vice President.” Lafayette, Ind., Dec. I.—The Courier of to morrow will contain the following: “A 

GRAVE COMPLICATION* —POSSIBLE CONTINGENCY OP GENERAL GRANT’S DEATH —WHAT THEN ?” The death of Horace Greeley and the possible con tingency of General Grant’s decease in the uncertainty of human life, present a grave complication in the Presidential succession. Next Wednesday the Electors meet at the several State Capitals to cast the vote. This vote is certified, sealed, and transmitted to the President of the Senate, in accordance with the twelfth amendment to the constitution and when the votes shall be opened and counted in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives in Febru ary, the person having the greatest number of votes shall bo the President. We assume that since Mr. Gree ley is deceased, the Electors for the six States he car ried will cast the vote of these States for Thomas Hendricks or some other Democrat. Now suppose, in the interval between next Wednesday and the Joint Con vention in February, General Grant should die, Hen dricks would be the only candidate before the House, which, by constitutional requirement must proceed immediately to ballot. They may filibuster till the 4th of March, when the Vice President-elect would suc ceed, but this is revolutionary. We suggest that on Wednesday Indiana cast her vote for Morton. This will not impair Grant’s majority, and covering the contin gency of his death, present two names for the House election. Baltimore, Dec. I.— Since the death of Mr. Greeley, a number of telegrams have been re ceived in tbis_ city, inquiring how the Electoral College of this State will cast its vote for Presi dent, and suggesting unanimity in the vote by electors in the States, electing Democratic and Liberal tickets. The Maryland electors will have a meeting to morrow night aud decide. The importance at tached to the vote to bo cast on Wednesday seems to bo tho bearing, it may have on a nomi nation four years hence. Hendricks’ name is proposed in all the telegrams received here. It is suggested that the National Democratic Com mittee should express its opinion. Special Despatch to The Chicaqo Tribune, Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. I.—The Sentinel to morrow will propose that the Liberal Presi dential Electors cast their votes for Mr. Hen dricks, Governor-elect of Indiana. Obituary. Ciulicothe, 0., Dec. I.—John R. S.

Albaxt, N. y., Dec, I,—Beeves —The market on Thursday opened dull, with a very small attendance of buyers, and less than 300 head of cattle were sold that day, the purchasers being local butchers, who only wanted a few cattle. Prices gradually dropped, and finally fell per lb from last week’s closing rates, and the market closed dull with scarcely any good cattle among the offerings. On Friday, at the opening, the attendance was larger, New York and Eastern buyers having arrived, but they did not want the quality offered, which consisted mainly of medium to common stock, and concluded to await the arrivals of those trains which had been detained by the snow storm, expecting to get some premium cattle. The late arrival of the trains induced the deal ers to wait till the following morning before they offer ed any cattle for sale, and consequently yesterday the opening of the market assumed a lively appearance. For a few hours the market was active although no competition can be said to have existed, for premium cattle were scarce and the market was overstocked with medium and common grades. An attempt was made to break the market down yester day, but it was not attended with success, the prices ruling steady at about #c per lb de cline on premium, and per tb on medium stock. There is no appreciable improvement in the quality this week, and th.e few heavy cattle offered did not equal those previously offered here as Christmas cat tle. n & Corbett’s ma- Feny streets, was 52,000; insured. ty on tlie south >r, opposite St. hero, in which a •out 14 years old, cn carousal lost the ground and e flames.

The “interview” betweei Detective Dixon and gambler McDonald, at Borke’s, early on Saturday evening, may hare occasioned the closing of the latter’s “banla” before the ar rival of Superintendent Waslburn. Mrs. Scott Biddons makes ler debut to-night as a reader in tho Star Course at the Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. The sale of seats has been very large, and the evening bids fair to be tho most brilliant of the courts. Yesterday was eventful no i only as the first day of winter, but as the first day of winter’s sports. The deceiving pleasure of sleigh-riding was indulged in, and tho meny jingle of sleigh bells was heard for tho Hrit time in many months It is suspicious, to say tho least, for a leading member of the detective corps to bo seen whis pering in the ear of a notorious gambler on the eve of a “raid” by his chief upon the faro banks. Will Mr. Dixon “ rise and explain ” ? In a Cottage Grove avence car nothing is pleasanter than for a man to make a pocket book of his mouth, and hand yon his fare to “pass up,” after_ it is well bedewed with saliva. Who wouldn’t wish to be a cashier under such circumstances ? The following were at Anderson’s European Hotel, yesterday: <7. D, Kiniy, Cincinnati; B. Vroeman, New York; J. J, Edwards, Boston; A.

Is it not a little singular that every gambling house in which Mike McDonald is interested, some ten in number, ranging in degree from “ bunko ” to “ brace faro,” were found closed and uninhabited Saturday night when Wash burn’s men made their “ raid ” ?

The arrival of the morning train from Terre Haute, yesterday, came near being marked by a fatal accident to Mrs. Alice Dun ning Lingard. Just as she stepped out of the car, the treacherous foothold afforded by .the snow gave way, and she slipped almost under the wheels of the sleeping-car. Her dress caught in the door, and the train, by an ngly co incidence, began to move. Mr. E. E. Kidder, who was standing near, with rare intrepidity sprang on the car and tore Mrs. Lingard’a dress from the dangerous clutches of the door, thus liberating her at the expense of a ruined skirt. FELL FROM THE FOOTBOARD. A Remarkable Accident Which Bcfel a Rail* road Engineer—lts Result. At half-past 2 o’clock yesterday afternoon, while switch locomotive No. 4, belonging to the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad Company, was proceeding west on Kinzie street, in the vicinity of May, the engineer, Patrick Walsh, stepped out of the caboose for the purpose of oiling some machinery at the head of the locomotive. While standing on the footboard, which occupies the place of the cow catcher in switch engines, his feet slipped, and befell upon his back between the rails. There being no fireman in the caboose to look out for danger in the absence of the engineer, the pon derous locomotive passed over the prostrate form of Walsh, but without injuring him in any way until the brake of the tender, which was several inches nearer to the ground than any other portion of the machinery, caught him, and rolled him over the ties for almost a block. TTi« cries for assistance were drowned by the hiss of escaping steam, and it is probable that the locomotive would have continued on its course for. an indefinite number of blocks, and that tho remains of the engineer would havo been distributed along the track, had not a little boy named Durfey ob served that the caboose was empty. He imme diately jumped upon the locomotive, and stop ped it by closing up the throttle-valve. Walsh was then discovered in the frightful position be fore described, and was released with great diffi culty. He was taken to his boarding-house, No. 127 North Halsted street, where a doctor exam ined his injuries. It was found that his left hip bone was broken, and that ho was severely in jured internally. His recovery is considered doubtful. The wife and children of the unfor tunate man reside at Woodstock. MURDERED FOR HIS MONEY. Inquest in the Cose of the Young Ulan found on the Chicago* Burlington & Quincy Bail* road Track Insensible from Wounds. Coroner Stephens held an inquest yesterday on the body of Henry Ohland, aged 26 years, a fireman employed by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Bailroad Company. Thera was but little testimony offered, the substance of which was that a man named John Murphy, who resides near the Throop street railroad crossing, discovered Ohland lying' insensible on the track at that point. Ho conveyed him to his boardinghouse, Ko. 133 Henry street, where he was attended by Dr. Motzmachcr. Everything that the physician’s skill and experience could suggest, was done for him, but proved powerless to prolong his life beyond 9 o’clock on Saturday morning. The post mortem examination of the remains revealed two fractures of the skull and a cut about three Inches in length on the left side of the head. The palm of the right hand was also badly cut, as if a knife or some other sharp instrument had been drawn through it. Deceased’s watch and money were missing. The jury rendered a verdict of death from compression of the brain produced by blows; but, owing to lack of evi dence, it was unable to state by whom said blows were inflicted. This mysterious murder is in the hands of the detectives, and, if their su&ess in similar cases in the past is any criterion to judge by, the perpetrators will undoubtedly be discovered. THE FIRST. “STRUCK” JURY. The Citizens Selected to Try* the Great Jumcl Case-New Counsel Retained in the Case—Ex-Attorney General Hoar to Oppose Charles O’Conor* From the Xew York Tribune, Xov. 28. The most remarkable civil action in the annals of American jurisprudence is to be tried in the United States District Court in this city next week. It is the ejectment suit of George Wash ington Bowen against Nelson Chase, to recover possession of the famous “Jumel Estate,” con sisting of 126 acres of the finest land on Wash ington Heights, in this city; of the property on the northeast comer of Broadway and Liberty street, and of a lot in Liberty street; the whole being worth, at present market prices, about $6,000,000. The same suit was tried in Jan uary last, and attracted public attention all over the country, although there was nothing peculiar in the jury, and the whole of the proceedings were much leas interesting than those which are to follow promise to be. In view of the fact that the interests involved are so enormous, the Court has now ordered “ a struck jury ? ” the first, it is understood, ever impanelled in this country. It consists of a panel of forty-eight prominent citizens, from which the jury to try the case is pruned by the counsel on each side alternately striking out one name after another, until only twelve remain. The jurymen impanelled for this purpose are as follows: Union Adams, furnishing store, No, 637 Broadway; John Abendroth, iron dealer, No. 109 Beekman street; Henry Bowers, merchant.

The great Tichbome case, tried in London last year, occupied eleven substantial business men for nearly nine months. Mon who wore making $50,000 a year by trade bad to abandon all busi ness and do the hardest work of their lives for $5 a day. But the Jumel is a case involving larger estates, and the jury promises to be made up of men of a still richer and busier class. It is impossible to guess how long tho case will be .before the jury; but the former trial occupied twenty-four days, and the parties to it havo since eprnt nearly a year, and vast sums of money, in collecting further testimony. Besides tho op posing lawyers know each other’s strong and weak points now ; and have fallen into a con test, perhaps even more bitter than the feel ing between plaintiff and defendant; so that there are prospects of criminations and recriminations, of charges of “ champerty,” “barratry,” “subornation,” and whatnot, with voluminous testimony and argument npon each charge, so that the poor jurymen will be lucky if they come to an end of the trial before New Tear’s, to say nothing of the time it may take them afterward to make up their minds. The lawyers who will conduct this memorable fight arc among the ablest in the country. Hr. Charles O’Conor has been in the case from the first. Forty years ago ho was the con fidential adviser and counsel of Aaron Burr, then Madame Jumel’s husband, and defended the divorce suit which she brought against Burr. From that time Mr. O’Gonor has been profes- sionally busy about this vast property. At tbo former trial no man of a national refutation faced the leader Of the New York Bar; but-this time he is to be met by the Hon. E. B. Saiw, late Attorney General of the United States, ou-ft of the toughest legal wrestlers of the day. Be side these leaders of the case, many other coun sel are to take part. Mr. Hoar, for George W. Bowen, will be sustained by ex-Attomey General Leri S. Chatfield, Chauncey Shaffer, ex-Surro cato Gideon J. Tucker, William A. Beach, Mr. Sawyer, and .others; while STr. O’Conor will be assisted, as before, by James C* Carter and by Nelson Chase, the defendant himself. - It is probable that a new phase of this curious case maybe developed by this trial, and it is whispered that a now claimant may app.fi.ar> and enter suit for the possession of the immense estates. On the original trial, it will be remem bered, the jury disagreed; neither Bowen nor Chase succeeded in establishing a title to the property, though the latter was left in posses sion, It is now claimed by lawyers familiar with the issue that, by escheat m default of heirs, the estate is really the property of the State of New York. At any rate, it is a subject o.t Allacusslon among lawyers, who say that since th*>.yo $6,000,- 000 are held under a doubtful title, and claimed under another certainly as doubtful, it is the duty of the Attorney General or other State representatives to put in a third claim. There is not the slightest probability that this will be done, however, until the decision now sought has made the chances of the State to recover less doubtful than they now appear. It will be remembered that originally Mr. Chase claimed the Jumel estate as the husband of Mary Anne Jones, whom he asserted was the daughter of Madame Jumel, that the latter had so informed him, urging him to marry her child, and promising to leave her the whole Jumel estate. This is -no longer his claim. Ho now affirms, it is assorted, that his wife was the daughter of Walter and Mary Bowfin, a sister of Madame Jnmel. At the death of. Madame Jumel (July 16, 1865,) Chase as sumed control of the property and excluded from it several children of this Mary Bowen, subse quently Mrs. Jones; but later compromised with these claiments by payments of slojooo for their interest in the estate. He now claims that they were the true heirs-at-law, not his wife, and that he la entitled to the property through Eurchase of their right. The plaintiff claims to o the illegitimate eon of Madame Jumel herself, and as such has a prior right to the Joneses. In order to establish his diaim Mr. Chase has, therefore, to prove: I. That Madame Jumel died without issue; that is, that George W. Bowen is not her child. 11. That Mary Bowen and Madame Jumel were both legitimate children of the same moth er (Thebe Kelley or Bowen); for though an il legitimate child may inherit from its mother, no other relation of illegitimacy gives a title to in heritance. m. That Mary Bowen, instead of dying in 1797, as claimed by plaintiff, lived to become first Mary Clarke, and then Mrs. Jones, and the mother of those whose right Chase has pur chased. It is very clear that if it cannot now be proved that the Jones family were the legitimate nephews and nieces of Madame Jnmel, the whole vast estate is really without heirs, and le gally reverts to the State. The case comes up next Monday, and will probably be tried without further delay. TWO
