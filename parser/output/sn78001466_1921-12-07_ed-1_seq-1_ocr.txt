(Continued on Page 6) Governor Hardee Talks . ors On Subject IBy AMoclnted Frriwl Charleston, S. C, Dec. 6 Prison management was discussed tonight in the House of Governors after an ad dress on this theme by Carey A. Har dee, governor of Florida. Governor Hardee said that princi pally there are two schools of thought with relation to prisons, ihe senti mental and the pracical. The former lavish sympathy upon the criminal, creatine: a lack of respect for the law. The practical criminologists believe that society is entitled to pro tection from the criminal and that the widows and orphans of murder victims should-be fully protected. Governor Hardee declared that too much coddling of criminals belittles the law and "kills the fear of the law in the souls of the weak men." He emphasized his opinion that a convict should not be self sustaining, but should return a profit to his state in compensation for the money spent in assuring him a fair and im partial trial. With respect to young offenders Governor Hardee said that he favored correctional institutions but that the herdened adult offenders were not entitled to similar gentle treatment.

The Booster Cards will be in the hands of the Chamber of Commerce late today and the task of affixing post age will commence at once. So that there may be none who can not mail out hundreds of these cards the Chamber has arranged several lists so possible of multiplication that that one sheet of ordinary let ter size paper affords a mailing list of over one thousand desirable names. The desire of the Postcard Committee is to have every business house, club, fraternal organization as well as every citizen compile their own list and mail these cards accor dingly, he lists' prepared by the Chamber of Commerce are intneded only for those of willing spirit but uncertain of their ability to recall the names and addresses of a thousand desirable industries, farmers or new residents for Palatka.
