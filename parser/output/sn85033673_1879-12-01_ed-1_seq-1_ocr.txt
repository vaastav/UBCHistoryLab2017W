We publiah to-day a coiumuuica tion from Mr. Wm. 15. Moore on the subject of earth closets, which will be read with interest. He makes the most out of a very utmttractivo theme and is very happy in J'acctiousnesa. We are inclined to agree with him that no earth closet system can be gen erally and permanently adopted. It would require more attention than the majority of mankind would bestow. It might answer for somo fam ilies of adults who understand the laws of nature and the im portance of sanitation, but in many instances the use of earth would be neglected and the neighborhood would beeme unendurable. A sewer system is within our means. Mr. Moore's suggestion is practical get the vaults cleaned out at night partly filled with earth and use as before until a connec tion can be made with the sowers. We take it for granted from the present indications of popular sentiment that a system of sewerage will be undertaken this winter which can be finished in from three to five years. If a reasonable tax bo levied for such a purpose, the people will pay it promptly in prefer ence to any other tax, because they know the money will be expended at onco in their midst ; that it will give employment to labor, improve the licalthlulness of the city and enhance the value of their property. If the legislature is convened in extra ses sion, we shall insist that the bill to be submitted shall contain a provision allowing tho sewerage tax to be paid separately, whether other taxes arc paid or not. Many people who cannot pay all their taxes would make an effort and pay a tax of this kind for the improvement of our sanitary con dition. MEMPHI8 AE3 HER HECESSITIE3. Under this caption the Nashville American of the 30th ult., contains a sensible and dispassionate editorial, from which we take the following paragraphs : '"The first consideration now for the public mind in Tennessee is the reflec tion that there is an evil and that it calls for some remedy. Is it purely local, or is it an evil which affects all the people of the state? In one sense it is local, in that the plague and di rect interruption of business and loss of life arc nt Motuphis. It docs not stop there. Tfinnessco feels the de struction of her citizens as a direct loss of energy. The commerce of the entire state fools the weight of the blow directly and indirectly. Tho af fected city becomes a plague center of distribution. Almost all of West Tenne6soo suffers in health, in stagna. tion of industry and commerce and in reputation. Indeed, it affects the reputation of the entire state. We know of a colony which was about to settle in a mountainous country which was deterred by this very cause, and, sillhougli theycamo eventually, it was in diminished numbers. Memphis is the largest commercial city in the -state, occupying an excellent position, from which it draws commerce from Arkansas and Mississippi, by reason of its position and the aggregation of capital and concentration of transpor tation on account of position. Her commerce, tho large taxes she pays, the development of the surrounding country by a large city are so much ilenr gain for Tennessee. Jliere is thus no ninglo interest af fected that docs not directly touch the pocke of all Tennessee. In commerce, agriculi.we.iinniigration, in tax-paying and sharing burdens, in all progress, Memphis, jlague-strickcn, becomes a burden instead of a benefit. Then it is plain that, wi;ilo it. is immediately local, the evil is Kenenl. It is one for sistance can be afforded, and we doubt not that those who are in close com munication with the subject can sug gest a policy at once feasible and ade date, and upon this point wo do not venture an opinion in the present state of knowledge as to precisely what is needed. As to tho general and vital interest of the State in the subject as to-the duty of those whose position tirings them ofEciilly in contact with the subject and with 11 tho means of information to auggest somo adequate and practicable remedy, there W P question. Mr, W. P. Dunavant, of this city and Mr, David Cullahan, of Pensacola, have taken a contract to build 70 miles of railroad from TcnsacoU Junction, which is 42 miles this side of Peuat coln, to l'ine Applo Station on tho Seliua and Gulf Railroad. This will give Selma a direct route to PcnMucola by 1M miles of railroad through a f ne cotton country. The work is being 3one by English capitalists. Th iron is broughtas ballast from England at 01) cents on tho ton. I'cusaculu Las a splendid harbor. Mr. Dtinavauf, just from there, saw two hundred and lifty sailing veswls faking on lumber at ono time. If !e only had the Memphis and Selma road through, this would give Memphis tbe elmrtcat liossiblc outlet to saltwater and to tho cotton mirkcts of Europe. With tlu return of prosperity and tho disap pearance of epidemics, which may reasonably be expected, we will soon be in a eonditiou to consider great enterprises and enter upon no era of prosperity little dreamed of in the jast ten years. the people ot jMcmplu to ueai wiui, but tlie people of Tennessee cannot af ford to allow, that tho evil go forever unremedied. tVoneration ana as l i . l T) VOL XXIX. Ji st as wo expected, Currie, the assasin' of Ititcr. the inoffensive actor, at Marshail, Texas, was granted j another continuance the other day, j and the case cannot bo called until j April. This time it was the State's witnesses who were absent. They were there the first time, some of them having traveled over fifteon hundred miles to give their testimony. They were enabled to bear the expenses of such a trip by the aid of their professional brethren in the East. The State refused to allow the ease to go to trial on somo slight tech nical grounds, and the witnesses as well as the outside public felt . that it was all a farce and a mockery, and that Currie would never bo brought to justice. There was some mild talk about hanging him some time or other, but it is more likely to be done for some future murder, 'after he gets out of jail, than for . the mur der of Porter. It was hard ly to be expected that Mr. Harrymore would break a good en gagement at Philadelphia and lose his place to face the chances of another continuance, or that Miss Cummins, who was so unnerved by the terrible scene she was forced to witness, would feci like going back to have the horror recalled. Another witness, named Harvey, who was present at tho mur der, lately visited Shreveport, where Currie lias a brother a man of influ ence, and, if we mistake not, the Mayor of that place. Harvey was not present when the case was last called. We still predict that Currio will go scott free. His release has only been a matter of time ever since the first continuance was granted. The public is waiting, but not very patiently, to hear from the committee of fifteen, appointed at a mass meeting of citizen:), over two weeks ago. This jury has been out 16ng enough. We want a report without further delay. Time is precious and it is burning up. If these gentlemen with all tho lights before them cannot agree upon some thing lot them sny so, and the peoplo will look in somo othe'r direction for advice. The re port of the sanitarians and ex perts was submitted last Friday, it contained practical suggestions worthy if consideration, but the coninittce Jiouldnot cogitate all winter and then inform u that it is too late to do any thing this year. The fever has been over a month, and what has Memphis within herself done toward imnrovinir the sanitary condition of the place? W e answer, held a mass-meeting and proposed in the legislative council an ordinance requiring an earth closet system to be established. The world outside says we are doing nothing, and the proposition is not hard to prove. Indifference on the part of property holders and business men to tho pro per administration of municipal eov- erunient years ago, brought about our deplorable condition. Every other man has a theory or a plan, and each ono is opposed to all other plans, except his own. We have never seen the people of Memphis agree upon any thing except getting out of town when an epidemic is announced. This committeo is composed of as good and intelligent men as we have, and if they cannot agree upon a plan of action and that speedily, we may as well give up doing anything this winter. A l.L the lawlessness and sin of the country is not confined to the South. Tho Cincinnati Commercial of yester day contains the following startling head-lines over its columns of local and tolcgraphic news: "Sins found out. Horrible story from Springfield, Ohio.

BLIC MEMPHIS, TENN.: MONDAY EVENING, DECEMBER i, 1879. The President's annual message, presumably delivered to congress to day, is quite a voluminous document and ono that comparatively few per sons will read. He congratulates con gress on the success of resumption, and tho prosperity of the country. Polygamy in Utah receives more than a passing notice, with tho suggestion that those who violate the -law be punished. The late elections seem to have bad a pleasing effect on the ex ecutive mind. John Sherman's barrel in Ohio was not in vain. As to civil service reform, which the President preaches but don't practice always, he says his former views aro strengthened by enlarged experience. Much space is devoted to this subject. Uur relations with for eign powers are as lovely as usual. The reports of the departments are alluded to in as dry a manner as possihft. Eads jetties are a success so far. Peace reigns like a lamb on a southern hill side on the Mexican frontier. The secretary of the navy has saved up and turned over nearly a million and a halt dollars which is more than can be said of his predecessors. The business of the supremo court is in arrears; ad ditional circuit judges are recom mended. Recommendations are made to still further civilize the Indians. Agriculture, we are informed, is a leading industry. Education should be iostered, and national literature, whatever that is, should be perpetu ated. This, doubtless, includes presi dential messages sent out ahead of time.. The streets of Washington arc out of repair and some of them should be repaved. The people there also want more new school houses. No allusion is made to the south. This is the sum and substance ot a message, which fills more than one side of a big newspaper. We could not afford to publish it for less thau twenty cents a line, and then would have to apologize to our readers for the infliction. Since the stalwarts have discovered what they imagined to be a Grant movement among the Democrats of the South, they have cooled off won derfully and begin now to reason that tho country can take care of herself without the aid of any particular man. They aro lato finding it out. We can assure the unreconstructed Republi cans that there is a kiuJly feeling to ward Grant personally iu the South, and that if he ever comes this way we will treat him with proper respect and give him as cordial a welcome as he ever received in his life. This however, has no po litical significance whatever. We think Grant would make a great mis take to accept the presidency from any party or from all parties combined. He has outlived the prejudices that grew up against his administration. although not tho memory of it. He is recognized as the most prominent private citizen of thd country, honored at homo and abroad, and need not want for useful em ployment in a lucrative position congenial to his tastes and habits. There are private corporations which could well afford to give him fifty thousand dollars a year for his ser vices aud tho use of his name. The question seems to be who will capture him; the Republican party or the Nicaraugua canal. There is no danger that the Democrats will nominate him for president. Indication.
