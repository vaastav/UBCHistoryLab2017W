In this way be would have the voting to gitean evict representation of the per sonal force and worth of the voter, and of his poiti'r to influence society in other ways than by voting. Prof. Ijorinicr quotes in U half or his scheme saing of Emerson: "If jou rcpicscnt numlnrs only, money will repiesent ilselt by brilnry. if you repre sent money only, numliers will represent themselves by violence and exlcrruinaliou." I r is announced that the litter attributed to Weaver and seeming to indicate that be was conspiring with the KcpubHcan Nation al Committee, was written apparently by tbe same rsTsi.ii -who wrote the "dorey letter. A comparison of the two by cvperts shows such strong and frespicut resemblances that Iheei.ncliision seems inetitable that they were written by tbe same band. Other for-ge-ries of l.-s importance, but having al) a political motive, arc also said to be the work or the same ingenious rascal, ir the internal n i.li nee is good for anj thing.

President llajes urgeslhat Congress make a thorough inicstigaliou of every case coming In fore it of tiolation of the Constilu tinnal anu nduienls, and loses this branch of tbe message with a leis.niincnilation thai, as popular education gives the assurance and guarautyof popular friedoin.

He strongly condeninslhe "spoils" system, by whiili the appointing iwwerlias lieen so largely en croached uion by Congress. a to polygani-, the President considers promntnd dtiided measures necessary. Oue of Ki recommendations is that a (Sovern.ir of the territory of Utah and judges or commis sioner be appointed by the Federal Govern ment thus placing the territory un Jer a gov ernment analogous to that or Ihe North-vest, in the early days of the lte public. An alter native recommendation is that polygannsts bedenrived or the right to vote, holdothi-c and sit on juries. A very large portion of the message is oc cupied with a statement e.f our foreign re lations. The Fortune Bay aftai r is, the Presi dent says, in a fair way to be silisfaclordy scttlcd. In relation lo the proposed Isthmian canal he repeats his previous opinion that the United States ought to assert and main tain such supervision and authority over it as to protect our National interests. A num ber of other matters in relation to our foreign affairs are touched tiion, but Ihe two men. tioncd are of the chicfest general iuteiesl. As to our foreign commerce1, tbe Pre-side-nt is strongly in favor of lilral subsidies. In relation to the finances, the following figures arc given: The National revenues to the year ended June 30, 18), were jTi!, SiG.r.lO; expenditures, $2ti,MJ,9S7 leatiiig a balance of surplus revenue e.f :rij,bN",boI, whieli, wilh light millions cash from Ihe Treasury, was applied to the sinking fund. The estimates for the curre-iit te'arshow a probable surplus of 11111013- millions of dullars. After reciting the recent operations of the Treasury Department, President Hayes dis. cusses tbe legal lender ipiesliou. strongly fa voring the immediate retirement of Ihe entire issue of legal lender notes. Their issue-, be says, was a war nee-essity and tiny are uow simply a long-ote-r-duc debt, which the N 1- lion should reileem at once. While not op posing the issue of silvercurrency, he rcconi- lnends that the elollar Is; made ccpial in value- to gold, instead of, as for Ihe last year. Is ing worth only fcSJ vnts. In his remarks upou the nrnry, Prcsld. ul Hayes recommends the passage of a law, with suitable protiaions as to couiensalion, retirement and other details, creating Crneral Grant Caplain General a measure, he sajs. allogelhel fitting and proper and one that would 1-e warmly approved by theeimntri.

Inonhr to help refunding, and tn bring the oitorlunity for investment iu (tovtin incnt securities within reach of the gnat middle class, the Secntary recommends that authority be given him tn issue $4 0l),000, 000 of trta-mry notes, in sums not less lhau rl0, bearing not over 4 ptr cent interest, and tn run from one to ten jears. Tlie proceeds would le usinl to pay off 5 aud G per cent bonds. Secretary Shi mum thinks that Ihcne notes w t ml.
