Tho special reductions in finished product prices by the brass interests are ex pected to stimulate demand. Drnss manufacturers held up quotations as long as they could to protect their high prices contracts, but are now meeting the situation squarely. Cop per metal has gono through a sub stantial price readjustment and when the finished goods end of the copper business is readjusted a basis wilt have been laid for recovery.
