CONORESS MEETS-PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE The first regular session of tlie Fifty-fifth Congress mot at noon Monday. Seventy-seven Senators nnd 805. 'Representatives were present at the opening session and answered to their names on roll call. A large number of specta tors were in the galleries to wit ness the opening ceremonies. The business was all of a routine char jicter and without special incident. The message of President Mc- Kinley was read to both houses, nnd was listened to with close at tention. It is a long document nnd cannot be given in the Robe poxia.v. The following editorial review of it is taken from yester day's Charlotte Observer: Tho mossage of President Mc Xinley, delivered to Congress yes terday, consisted of 12,000 words. Instead of printing it in full in "which case nobody would have read it we print a carefully ed ited abstract of it of 7,150 words. There is nothing very remarkable iibout it and yet it is rather enter tainingmore so- than President Cleveland's last message, which was not only too long but was lumbered up with the dullest of statistics made up from the re ports of the heads of departments nnd of the tedious discussion of uninteresting foreign affairs. The President treats the tariff question as settled, as indeed it is during his term of office. lie is not bragging much, however, on ' the results it has thus far pro duced. He gives the assurance that during his administration all the money of the country will be kept of equal value with gold, but wisely suggests that a cheaper method of doing this, in case of trcss, shall be provided. The government, he points out, is the only institution that is called upon to Tedeem in gold, and he shows the necessity of doing some thing about the demand notes "wliich will not stay redeemed after being redeemed. His suggestion that notes which are redeemed in gold should not bo paid out agpin except in exchange for gold is a good one, ns also the other sug gestion that banks be required to redeem tbeir notes in gold. The only recommendation he makes looking to the expansion of the currency is that national banks be allowed to issue notes at the par aluo of the bonds they deposit to secure their circulation and that the tax upon their cireulation be reduced this obviously for the purpose of inducing them to take out. more. In his treatment of the Cuban question, the President is consorva- uve and sensible. He perhaps nets more store by Spain's good imenuons wan. the facts but he planta himself against any jjiypuftition which would involve mis country in a needless war with epam. While opposing the an luxation of Cuba, he favors annex ing the carpet-baggers, heathen self to uphold and extend it. Thin he sends the iron to the souls of the Norih Carolina Republicans who'are out of jobs. They ask him for fish and he gives Ihenfa ser pent. - All in nil the message is rather readable mid will repay one for thotimo spent in going through it. A Card From Rev. J. A Smith. J.niTDR Rouksoxiax: In last J. . n . uuk a iiom.HOMAN some one re porting the proceedings of the Robeson Association says : "Rev. J.J. Scott, of Alfordsville, spoke briefly. He corrected the mat ters of history in dispute by Mos- sers Ducket t and Smith." The statement of your reporter is mis leading, for there was nothing of importance between 'Prof. Duckett and myself for any one to settle hen Prof. Duckett read his admirable report on foreign mis sjons I simply suggested a change m a portion of his phraseology on the ground that as the report read it would convey the idea that no missionary enterprise ever start eel Irom Asia. I said that Asia did send out the GosneL and the trouble was this. The churches of Asia lost the missionary zeal and spirit. Neither Prof. Duckett, nor any one else, disputed this state ment, for every one knows that ong before Paul was beheaded at Rome he planted the renowned church of Ephesus, which was in Asia.. Paul lived at Ephesus, and achieved there some of his most brilliant missionarv sucpfi?sp Iere he debated all the great doc trines of the faith till all Asia had tidings of the truth as it is in Jesus. Ephesus was . also the home of the beloved John. Here he preach ed and here he died. In the weeds and amid the rubbish of old Eph esus can be seen the marble bap tistry he used for the baptism of ns candidates. It was at Ephe sus that Apollus was converted to Christ and first exercised his gifts m tne interest of thr a Here, too, the beloved Timothv ischarged the duties of the sacred ministry and died of mob violence. hese facts support the very brief statement I made that Asia sent out the Gospel but the trou ble with the churches was this : They did not retain the true mis sionary spirit. mi j mereiore your reporter does is admitted by Mr. Smith in his letter above, and additional facts are given by him in support of his contention. Prof. Duckett replied and stated what he intended to convey by the report. As we ; un derstood them one gentleman ar-s-ucd that the Gospel came to Eu rope from Asia and the other that it camo from Koine. When Mr Scott began his speech he stated that both were wrong as tho Gospc was first brought 'to Europe by the Greeks, who carried it to the Scot tish Highlanders. This claim was not contested, and not knowing the facts, we took it for granted that Mr. Scott was correct. llio discussion was not in the least acrimonious, that we could see, it was carried on in the best of spirit seemingly, and the large congregation enjoyed it very much It was remarked upon by several intelligent people as very interest ing. .1 We took no notes of the Associa j A uou mm wrote irom memory, therefore could not give a full re port even, had we had the space The impression conveyed to - pur mind Tay the aiscussion was tlie same as that conveyed to others with whom we talked Wednesday niglit and lhursday.. Mr. Scott took the sama view of it as his re remarks showed. ITT ... u e regret that Mr. Smith has seen cause for offense in it. Noth ing was further from our thoughts and we hope this disclaimer and explanation will be satisfactory 

MAXTOR. HAPPENINGS. LOCAL AND PERSONAL NEWS OF O'JR SISTER TOWN. M.G. MCKENZIE, Reporter. an TVlbUUUta Or H n u-n . . for no other reason than that the imuonai "honor" demands it We are at a loss to know what this means unless it be that this-country, having, aided in the theft of lUB "awauan government from tho Pople to whom it belonged, is uuiio io stand by its pals, agreea bly to tho proverb which tells us that there is honor among thieves The country is informed official ly by the President of the falling down of tho errand of the bi-mel-allio commission. He breathes upon the dry bones of inter-nation- Mi-uiouuiism, out it will le wnnout result. His real for reciprocity is arc tesqne. Reciprocity is free trade. jne declaration that "we should do our full share of the carrying "uue u ino world" and that our snips snould be "familiar visitors at every commercial port of the world" sounds like irony in the mouth of a purblind protectionist whose policy tends to shut cur ports against all the world and to Bhutan the world's ports against us. &On inter-nationar arbitration ud quarantine laws tho President takes good ground. Ho re-affirms hi devotion to the cause of civil service reform and pledges him-- both myself and Prof. Duckett injustice, for there was in reality no mistake or serious dispute on our part. Mr. Scott corrected no matter of history between us. H got off on something else and too Jl j . . advantage ot the occasion to tel the old Scotch about Red Springs wnere tliey came from and how sister Effy got her name from Greece via Scotland These are the facts in the case and we hope that your reporter will next time give the facts just as tney occurred. If Prof. Duckett and myself had ior even a few minutes each mo nopolized the floor of the Associa tion the fact would have been de veloped that there was" no dispute or ainerence of opinion between ns. ,1 would have paid no atten tion whatever to the report of the Association were it not for the fact that some people are placing the wrong construction on the article and seem to think that Pmf Duckett and myself got into some niunder in the matter of church History, which 13 not true.

He is an enthusiastic ad vocate of the farmers diversifyin 1 1 tneir crops that each farmer plant at least enough tobacco to justify the erection of one barn on his farm. We are wil Hnr tr. 1 the farming interests in the hands of the farmers, who are ever learn ing irom experience, and we al ways think it a little impotent for a newspaper man who has never ploughed a furrow in his life to be calling the farmers fools because they don't farm according to his ideas- but we submit for the far mers' consideration, would it not be wise, under stances, to make the experiment, of raising tobacco? Some have already done so and are the better for so doing. If fifty farmers around Maxton will plant an av erage of two acres each in tobacco it will justify the erection of a warehouse at this place and we be lieve will be of great financial ben efit both to merchant and farmer.
