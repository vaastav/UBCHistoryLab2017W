HOW IT IS HANDLED Important Ceremony of Preparation in President's Message. IlVOLVING ALL GOVERNIENT FORCES One Man Responsible for Secrecy Until Copies Go to Congress. INTERESTING DETAILS (Copyriht, 1901. by Waldon Faweett.) Written for The Evening Star. The message which the President of the United States transmits to Congress at the beginning of each session, In which he re Views the work of the various executive departments for the preceding year and 2nakes recommendations for the future. gasily ranks as the most important state decument in the republic, and from the time the chief magistrate commences work upon it until it is made public the contents are S matter of paramoun: interest to the na tional lawmakers and to the country at large. The mrthod of preparing a presidential Upssage is far-raching in its scope. As a first st.p the chi-f executive, some weeks b f-re Le is rt:t'v to begin the actual work -Ff writire th. d-urnent. asks each member of his ,abinet to prepare a report covering Ahe workings of his branch of the govern I _7 3nent and fmbodying his recommendations for the enczuing year. including an estimate of the amount .,f mnoney which will be re QuIredI for the miaintena!nce of the depart 2nent under his dirs-t!on. When a Presi dent has been in offiee fojr several years he is usually so, closely in touch with gov irnmental affairs ge~nerally that he needs this data prin. ipally as mo-moranda, but when. as In th ecase of President Roose Veit, a man ;s une xpctedIly called upon to as;s-ime the resp nsibilits of the highest offiep in the land arnd is re~quired to present A congressional mnessage almost Immediate 1y, the task -,f familiarizing himself with all the inte-rests involved is a herculean One.

The work is also so distributed among hun dreds of typesetters that it is impractici ble for any group of men to "compare notes" with a view to ascertaining the im port of any particular part of the docu ment. The assembling of all these various masses of type Is entrusted to a man of known reliability, and the same care is ex ercised with regard to the employes who print the documents and bind them. Much the same system Is followed that prevails In the bureau of printing and engraving. where currency Is printed. Each sheet of paper which Is Issued for use in printing a presidential message must be accounted for ere the workman to whom it has been in trusted is allowed to leave the building at night. The Distribution Time. The printed copies of the message are de livered at the White House, and from there distributed to the various newspaper of fices throughout the country, a Courtesy extended in order that the newspapers may not be put to the inconvenience of hur riedly placing in type this enormous doc ement in the few hours intervening be tween Its presentation to Congress and the hour at which a majority of the daily pa pers go to press. Each newspaper agrees, of course, not to divulge any of the con tents of the message In advance. In some Instances the "advance copies" of the mes sage have been issued to the newspapers six days In advance of the date of delivery, thus allowing time for the document to he transmitted by mail to publications on the Pacific coast, but on the other occasions, owing to tardiness in the completion of the document, less than forty-eight hours has Intervened. It has been necessary at such times for the press associations to tele graph the full text of the message to all the prominent daily papers in the more re mote sections of the country. This has en tailed an expense of thousands of dollars for telegraph tolls alone. Each member of Congress. when he takes his seat to listen to the reading of the pres idential message on the morning of a ses sign of the national le-gislature, finds be fore him a printed copy of the document similar to that furnished to the newspa pers. Yet this Is not the form In which it reaches the presiding officers of the two houses of Congress. The copy of the dot! ument which is formally presented for the consideration of each body Is In manu script, and the preparation and delivery of these copies are among the Important du ties of 'Maj. 0.

With thl announcement he hands the pac g w ch Is held by the official seal, to adg clerk, and proceeds to the house of Representatives, where the cere mony is repeated. Clerks in the two houses of Congress read the document aloud simultaneously, and modern newspaper en terprise enables the general publio in all parts of the country to become cognizant of the contents of the message by means of special editions of the great daily jour nals quite as promptly as the lawmakers seated In the halls of Congress. High Speed on Railroads. From the Baltimore American. Step by step the present engine has been raised from 500-horsepower to 1,500-horse power and more In some cases, but not by means of startling novelties of any 1ind. The chief Improvement has been secured through Increasing the boiler-power from 150. pounds per square inch, -which was a maximum fifteen years ago, to 20W pounds as a rule and 225 pounds per square Inch in some engines; but the - steam distributing details remain just where they were fif teen years ago, 'with some modifications in dimenstoris-none whatever In applica 

OMPOS I NGI tion. That the cylindrical, corrugmted fire box recently introduced by Corncdius Van derbilt has great possibilities in the diree tion of still higher pressures, and In that direction is an advance; but higher press ures alone will not Increase average rail way speed 20 per cent, and at least that is demanded. Tlie greatest stumbling block Is the line Itself. There Is no object in buildong high powered locomotives to drag trains up steep hIlls and around short curves, or upon gradients more or less heavry, by brute force. That is merely burning the candle at both ends, for it Increases the expense of maintenance without correspondingly improving the service. I F Inartistic Paper Money. From the New York Tribune. Whatever Its merits may be in some di rections, there can be little doubt that the national currency is, from an artistic point of view, the most revoltingly ugly paper money ever produced. Is It necessary, one is tempted to ask, In contemplating the 10 bill just Issued, to make before the civilized world so conspicuous, not to may offensive, an admission of our Indifference to the ap plication of artic taste In things govern mental? Surely we have outgrown that condition of things which at one time per mitted a Mullet to strew the country wth architectural monstrosities from one end to the other, and It might not unreasonably be supposed. therefore, that the Treasury Department iould have found time before this to reorganize the bureau of engraving and printing on lines a little more artistic than those on which It is now suffered to proceed. Some years ago, we believe, the government did Invite artists to submit de signs for a new currency Issue, following In this regard the example set by France, Italy, Germany and other countries, where the first artists are not averse to seeing the paper money of their country made in some measure to reflect the national tastes.

MANY II4STA;NCES CITED Special Carrespondenae pf The Evening Star. NNW YORK, December 11, 1901. The man who for many years was the chief New York agent of a famous-or as it was frequently branded in its day, in famous-lottery which attained octopus pro portions, kept the southernstate in which it was .carried on in an evil ferment for a long period and w,s finally wiped out by the ban of the federal government on Its mailing business, talked to the writer the other afternoon about some of the New York folks who profited by their winnings out of the demoralizing institution. This one-time agent of the, Gargantuan gambling scheme is now engaged in a reputable busi ness, so that, naturally enough, he is will ing that his friends should forget that he was ever connected with so shady and gen erally condemned an outfit as the brazen lottery that John Wanamaker squelched. "There's no do4bt," said this ex-agent of the big gambling . organization, "that a great many individuals throughout the country who got the right numbers and found themselves, for the first time in their lives, on velvet when the results of the drawings were announced went up in the air, so to speak, over their good luck. There were plenty of them who couldn't stand prosperity, and who went to the bad pretty swiftly upoa getting possession of the rolls of money their tickets called for. That end of it, you'll recall, was pretty well exploited in the rewspapers even wherr the old game was at the apex of its prosperity, and it was dwelt upon with great insistence and a wealth of detail when the lottery began to be rapped all along the line. Bred Many.Coal Oil Johnnies. "This fellow or that, a winner of one of the big prizes, would be portrayed as mak ing a sort of Coal Oil Johnny of himself while his money lasted, and then, after his big whizz and the inevitable giving out of his winnings, he would be pictured as re turning to his little old job, gloomy, mo rose and out of tune with himself and his humble station for the remainder of his life. Some of these stories were true, and a good many of then were not true. I am willing to admit that perhaps in a majority of cases the money won out of the old lot tery was a source of more harm than good to the winners, but this wasn't the rule, by a long shot. "Take New York city alone. I distrib uted tens of thousands of the tickets here. Even in proportion to its great population, New York was the biggest buyer of tick ets in the Uhttedt States with the single exception of Me*5 Orleans, where every body, black And 'White, took a monthly hack at the d~atrinjs. A good many of the capital prizes kfrifted this way. Hundreds of the larger prizes were taken down by New York investhrs in the tickets, and thousands of 'the 'minor numbers, calling each for a ftw hundred dollars, were cashed here. -Out'bf curiosity I have kept pretty close track of the persons who got goodly sums pf nieney out of the lottery, and while there were many conspicuous exceptions, mlost of the big New York win ners used th4ir winnings with common sense and add'ed torthe money. One of the exceptions, as you'll perhaps remember, was that sixty-year-old deacon of a 5th avenue churh, WAo pulled out $25,000 on his ticket and then promptly proceeded to incarnadin Ne* York after his peace ful, conservatiVe life. He kept them busy up around the Tenderloin for six months, when, awakening one morning to find him self broke, he promptly became good again. Case of Seventh Avenue Haberdasher. "Another case was that of the 7th ave nue haberdasher on a small scale who won $10,000, and who spent the entire amount inside of two months riding around the country on special trains, which he char tered for his exclusive use. I could multi ply instances like these, but they were all humorously dwelt upon at the time. The cases, however, in which the New York winners used their winnings to advantage and with as much caution as if they'd worked for and saved the money all their lives, have scarcely been told about at all. I'll just run over a few of them. "Every once in a while I see, reclining in a beautiful victoria hauled by a pair of blooded horses and driving through the park or up on the Harlem avenues with her handsome married daughter at her side and an overfed, blinking pug dog in her lap, an old Irish woman who did my washing and ironing more than twenty years ago. She lived down Cherry Hill way then, a hard-working widow with nu merous mouths to feed. She won a $50,000 prize. I sold her the ticket-rataher, by her particular desire I let her have it, instead of the money, in payment of a bill for washing that I owed her. I did this re luctantly, for I didn't believe that a wo man who had to work so hard for a living had any right to be fooling around with lottery tickets. "She insisted, however, and she won the $50,000. She knew what money meant, you'd better believe. She moved her little tribe into a small frame house up in Har lem, pinched out $1,000 wherewith to take it easy for a while, and handed over the remaining $49,000 to the man who was then corporation counsel of New York, whose washing and ironing she did. He was a wise investor, and he slapped every nickel of the $49,000 into Harlem real estate that he knew was going to begin booming pretty soon. It happened as he had figured it out. The boom came, and inside of three years the ex-washerwoman's Harlem -property was worth $250,000 spot cash any minute she asked for it. Sold Out at the Right Time. "She drew out at the psychological mo ment, as they say, cashed in and reinvested her money in first mortgages on gilt-edged real estate-and there you are. She is un der seventy today, healthy as a girl fresh from Vassar, has -married her daughter's off, to the right kind of men and put her boys in business for themselves, goes over seas to the ould sod for a visit every few years, and, altogether, has as good a time of it U.s any man; At woman on Manhattan Island. "There was Adolph Claus, who was driv ing a brewerysawagon about the streets of New York amil gulping down, after the manner of his kid,d about a hundred glasses of beer a day just to keep happy, when $20,000 pamne i way on a ticket that I purveyed to hifti' Adolph folded it into a neat little 1411 'with a couple of rubber bands aroundift, wet out to Chicago, picic ed out the spot Wbpre he wanted to start the restaur. che* been dreaming about all his life, g'sQ rich with the restaurant that he coul *t V% bothered with it any more and turnbd IS-over to his daughters husband, andi.he'ShAtiving in Berlin today with more f~ ies of contentment wreathing hi, 9ance than you've any idea of.

When the brewery man called on lKendig that morning he got a sound Wal loping for his abusiveness, and then Ken ewaQ ~e frce and roll of $1,000 bills, went out t ie c coast, and now's he's got restaurants all over the state of California, a grape ranch, a wife who looks just like Emma Calve did seven or eight years ago, a houseful of beautiful young ones and money to heave at the birds. He tol me the last time I whim out there that whenever I felt tht it was a case of the poor house for me, all I'd have to do 'ud be to wire him for the price of a ticket to California, and he'd 'tend to the rest. The. Chicago Milliner. "Out in Chicago there's a buxom, busi ness-like woman, not much above forty. and spry as ~twenty, who owns millinery stores in towns throughout Illinois, Wis consin. Iowa, Missouri, and all around that section. She runs them all from her big headquarters in Chicago. I remember the day I sold her the ticket that won her $5. 000. She was a pale, underfed-looking lit tle slip of a hat-trimmer employed In a 14th street millinery store, and working half the night as well as all day Sunday during the busy seasons. She took her $5, 000 to Milwaukee, where she had relatives, started a millinery establishment there, moved down to Chicago and went into busi ness there, and now, as I say, there are heaps of towns out that way where the women have to wear the hats she provides or go bareheaded. She goes to Paris for three months every year to attend to her buying, and when the foxy boys come around and Invite her to take a walk up the aisle to the altar with them she laughs merrily and asks 'em if they don't think there's going to be a change in the weather pretty soon. "A few months ago I spent more money than I felt like spending for a beautiful imitation antique brass hall lamp that my wife had got her eye upon and couldn't live without another minute, so she told me. I bought the lamp from a man who makes all kirds of gear of that sort, and the amount of money that he takes out of the bank on Saturdays to pay his gang of factory hands Is astonishing. This man was a huge lum mox of a blacksmith's helper on the day that he saw by the list In the paper that he was $10,000 richer by reason of a grimy ticket that he was carrying around with him. He took off his leather apron and asked his boss for his time, got his money in exchange for his numbered ticket, spent a few months looking around while he held on tight to the winning, and then decided that the career of a manufacturer of cop per, brass and wrought-iron articles was good enough for him. He went into it In a small way and now he grins easily when he gets a cablegram .from his wife -.nd daughters traveling In Europe demanding him to push some more money over their way. Theatrical Manager'u Luck. "There's a theatrical manager whose name you often used to see in the news papers-he's engaged in bigger enterprises than those connected with the stage now who made his first cut toward the top sawyer's perch out of a $2,000-winning ticket that I passed over to him a couple of decades ago. He needed the money right badly for hats and shoes and clothing and things like that, but he was too much on the gamble in the theatrical game to spend his money on the necessaries of life, and so he organized a 'Black Crook' outfit and started out west with it. He got the money from the beginning, Invested it in other fly-by-night one-night-standers, made good with those, too, drifted into legitimate man agement on a large scale, and got rich. Every time I met that man after he got to going right he'd drag me into a theater box and make me sit through one of his shows. "Tony Tasso, a bootblack who used to shine 'em up at the old Grand Central station, got $5,000 on a ticket that he pur chased from me one day while he was pol ishing my shoes, and with the money he went to Chicago and started a wholesale fruit business that made him so rich that he died of mere joy and Chianti years ago. "There was a little Alsatian dressmaker who used to make my wife's clothes back in the latter seventies. She had a little plant on 36th street and worked hard. She had got pretty well off during the war, selling drinkables and gimcracks to the soldiers of the pampered regiments en camped around Washington, but she had lost it all through the dishonesty of a countryman to whom she had given the money to invest for her, and so she started this little dressmaking establishment. Drew a Third of 25,oo. "She invested In the old numbered card boards for three years before anything came her way, and then she got hold of a number that entitled her to a third of a $25,000 prize. She knew how to do a good many money-making things, and so uthe went up to Boston, where she had kinsfolk, and started a tidy little plant for the man ufacture of swell pastryware for swell peo ple. From that she drifted into the cater ing business on a large scale, and when she retired from business and went back to Alsace a few years ago, rich as she ever wanted to be, she was mnore than missed by the society crowd of the hub, who had depended upon her for a iong time to pro vide them with daintily-served confections att receptions, luncheons and such. "One of the big cigar manufacturing es tablishments down in Key West has been owned for years by a Cuban who, while working at the cigar-making trade here, won $5,000 on one of the tickets. He bought an interest In the Key West outfit, worked his associates out by natural process of se lection in the course of time, and now he's a very rich man. "A silent partner In one of the big 6th avenue department stores got his start from the money that he won out of the lottery. A very 'prosperous trade paper published in New York is ownad by a man who bought It with a winning that he made In the same way. The trade pa per didn't amount to anything when he took hold of it, but he was a hustler and pushed it to the front right away. He not only derives a large income today from the trade paper Itself, but he has large holdings In the Interest which the jour nal represents. A string of horses com prising some of the best runners that ever looked through bridles on the Aimeri can turf was got together by a New York trainer who ran a $2 'shoestring' Into thousands through his Investment in one of the pasteboards. One of the New York harbor -pilots got hold of a sufliciently sizable bundle, through a similar invest mnent, to fit out a small schooner and go a-trading for coohineal, conk. and such stuff down in the South seas, and after a few immensely pronitable cruise. of that kind he leaned back, remarked that, being all to the good, terra firma was what he intended to enjoy for the balance of his years, and enjoyed It, The Luck of Kow Hoon. "Kow Hoon, a Chinamnan, who used to Iron them white down on Mott street, got out more than $8,000 on a one-third ticket that he bought from me, went back to China, and I suppose he's scattering bits of clored tissue paper over the graves of his forbears yet. "In spite of all of which," concluded the former agent of tho defunct lotery, 'now that I've ripened up some end have become what you may call a real good old man, I am convinced that the lottery was not a good thing. For every luck one upon whose fortunes the drawings ha beneficent effect there was at least one reckless winner to whom the pn==e==lon of the suden money was rather a curse than a blaeing.

Declara tion of ndependence. CRA HEGASFIRST IEUBET Served Until the Department Was Roorganized. SOM] INTERESTING DATA A recent Investigation of the question as to 'who Is entitled to the first place on the list of treasurers of the United States has demonstrated that some old traditions are at fault, and not the least interesting point brought out Is that the ofice is one of the rt established by the government. It formed the germ from which the Treas ury Department was evolved, and its early incumbents were fully as patriotic as the most sturdy of the revolutionary sires, de voting their "lives, fortunes and sacred honors" to this most important office, which antedates even the Declaration of Independence. Another point made plain i that the name which long stood at the head of the list of treasurers in the official register of the department should have been second. while the one popularly regarded by the old Washingtonians as the original treas urer was, in fact, the third. Incidentally much other data has been unearthed, and it is clearly apparent that the oMce, as well as the department, has kept pace with the other branches of the government. This bureau now employs a force of near ly four hundred persons and had when the government was established upon its per manent site in 1800 but four. Then it re quired but two rooms for the transaction of its business, and now has rooms suffi cient to have quartered all the branches of the government at that period. Before the revolutionary war the prov ince of Pennsylvania had for its treasurer Michael Hillegas, and he became the treas urer of the committee of safety. When the Continental Congress, July 29, 1775, deter mined to give the direct management of the finances to two treasurers. Mr. Hillegas and George Clymer, both of Pennsylvania. were appointed. The latter was soon afterward elected to Congress, and that body decided that thereafter there should be but one such officer. Mr. Hillegas became thereby the sole treasurer, and being well to do financially contributed of his means as well as his time to the cause of the patriots. In a few months after Mr. Hillegas took charge, February 17, 1776, Congress ap pointed a standing committee to superin tend the treasury, and to be known as the committee of finance, or "board of treas ury," and a month later established a treaury office of accounts. A treasurer of loans was added in July, 1876, and on a re port made to Congress In September fol lowing authority was given to "provide a house in the city or place when Congress should sit, wherein shall be held the several offices of the treasury." Under Articles of Confederation. Little change was made in the character of the treasury until the articles of con federation were signed. July 8, 1778, when other offices were added-a controller, au ditor and two "chambers of accounts." February 13, 1779, Congress resolved to ap point a Secretary of the Treasury, but It was not until the close of May following that Robert Troup was appointed. A some what similar system to the present practice of the department was then established. February 20, 1781, a superintendent of finance was chosen in the person of Robert Morris. It was he who conceived the Idea of the establishment of a national bank for the purpose of facilitating the financial operations of the government, and three months after, May 26, 1781, he laid before Congress a plan for such an institution. This was approved and an act incorporat ing the Bank of North America was pass ed December 31, following. Thus the pioneer national bank in this country was created one hundred and twenty years ago. Under the articles of confederation, which became effective by final ratification. March 1, 1781, and the Constitution framed in 1787 and ratified the year after, Mr. till legas continued in the office, about which the other treasury offices had been gath ered, till the latter instrument went into effect, and the department had been re organized by Alexander Hamilton, Mr. Hillegas vacating the office September 11, 1789. The name of samuel Meredith has been the one to head the list of treasurers in the offical register for years past, and he has been recognised as the first treasurer, from the fact that he was the first to be appointed to the office after the Constitu tion had gone into effect, and the depart ment was established under that instru ment. This document went into effect and Washington was inaugurated in April, 1789*. The Treasury Department was established under this instrument September 2, 1781*, and a treasurer was appointed in the per son of Gen. Meredith September 11 of that year. Mr. Hillegas was therefore the treasurer under the Constitution several months, and for a few days after the re establishment of the department under that instrument. In fact, he had been "treas urer of the United States" for fourteen years previously, for the term United States appears in the Declaration of 1776, and in the articles of confederation of 1778, as well as in the Constitution. This examination of the archives resulted in putting the name of Michael Hillegas at the head of the list of treasurers. Drops to Second Place. Though the name of Gen. Meredith drop ped down to the second place in the list it deserves to go down in history with that of his predecessor. He, like him, was a Philadelphian-a brother .n-law of Mr. Clymer, and besides his service. to the cause of the patriots in a pecuniary way he having contributed over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars-he made a rec ord in the continental army, rising to the position of brigadier general. Under Alex ander Hamilton and Oliver Wolcott, Gen. Meredith served through the administra tions of Washington and John Adams. The office of the treasurer was moved here with the government and the Treas ury Department, which had grown up around it, was fortunate in finding that the building intended for it, known as the "east executive building," was ready for occupancy. This wa~s an oblong brick structure covering but a small ortion of the present site, with two fulstories, basement and attic and containzing over thirty rooms. This fronted north, west of 15th street and the north wail was at about the south line of F street. In the northeast corner of the main floor of the building General Meredith was located, with but two or three clerks. During his incumbency, which ended October S1. 1801. a fire took place in the building, but through the exertions of the officers, em ployes and citisen. it was confined to two or three rooms, The conduct of the sec retary,(bliver Wolcott, in givn his atten tion to the -safety of some of isprivate property stored there was criticised, but a congressional investigation resulted in his vindication. The next incumbent of the office was not taken from Pennsylvania, as the preceding treasurers had been. Presidnt Jefferson appointed Thomas Tudor Tucker of South Carolina to that office December 1, 1801. He was well up in years at the time, and, serving till 1828, was looked upem locally as the original incumbent. He was a na tive of the st=Earma= of the earne stock as the Tuckers of Virginia; was born in 1748, educate for aa lica.and had long been a citimen represented hi. state In Congress. He was of suck genl disosi tion that he became quite as popular' in un D1ial circles as he was with the efnacis element, and long befor his death ho was regarded as a thorough W..tJangams.= It' was during his term as Ureasurer that the treasury building was, in Augug, burned by the British.

This was due to the change of the financial policy of the gov ernment and consequent increase of busi ness, as well as to the adoption to some extent at least of the principle "to the vic tors belong the spolls." One or two of the old employee were dropped and four or five new clerks were appointed. Among the latter were Andrew Smith, Henry Jackson and Samuel Forrest, and Col. Peter G. Washington was the chief clerk. The latter was afterward the chief clerk of the de partment, sixth uditor and assistant see retary. ardical change was also made this time re In Mr. Campbel's time, for the building wag 50 nearly destroyed. April 8O, I8A, that other quarters were necessary. It was alleged that the building was set allre by one of the clerks and he was ar rested and tried, but acquitted. Several buildings on the site now occu pled by the Hotel Regent, at the corner of Pennsylvania avenue and 15th street, were secured for the use of the department. These were three-storted brick dwellings, and in a day or two the department re sumed business, the treasurer's ottice being located about fire doors east of 16th street. This was on the ground floor, the two rooms In the main building being occupied by the clerks, while Mr. Campbell located In the back building. In the room used be fore as the kitchen. An octogenarian, who. before the civil war, spent the greater por tion of his life In the department and whose father was there before him, Is authority for the statement that the heads of de partments and bureaus and the employes took matters in those days in a free and easy manner; that few had duties which required continuous labor, and in some cases the clerks were so efficient that but little time was required to "keep their desks up." He states that he knew one clerk who had the reputation of being a lightning calculator, and who seldom spent more than a week in a month in keeping his work up-to-date. Another, who subse quently became a leading democratic editor and politician, was prompt In reporting at 9 o'clock in the morning, would read the morning papers. look over his desk and s. if there was not too much work in sight an.] if the weather was suitable he would take his gun, and, in a few hours, south of the President's house, viould bag a number of birds, and not Infrequently a few rabbits. During Mr. Campbell's term, in conse quence of the removal of the goverinment deposits from the banks. the treasurer be came the actual custodian of the public moneys and vaults, for its safe keeping were necessary, as were also the facilities usually found in banks. Consequently, when the new building authorized by the act of July 4, 1836, was constructed, these facilities tor handling and keeping the money were provided. That portion of sandstone fronting on 15th street was first erected and a small vault constructed in a room destined for the use of the treasurer. His suite comprised several rooms on the east side of the main hall of the south wing, but were only temporary, and were occupied for a year or two only. Col. Selden Becomes Treasurer. Succeeding Mr. Campbell was Col. Win. Selden, afterward United States marshai for the District and In the banking busi ness. He was appointed by President Van Buren July 22, 1839, and served under liar rison, Tyler, Polk and Taylor, vacating un d3r Mr. Fillmore November 2', 197.0. Under him the othec was moved to what was in tended to be its perman-nt quarters in the west wing of the building, th-n in course of construction. Here in the first room on tne north side of the hall was constructed a massive stone vault for the money, while the adjoining room on the west was lur nished for the counting room. The six rooms or. the south side of this hall accommodated the treasurer and his ertire official force. Col. William Beverly Randolph of Virginia, son-in-law of Gen. James M. Lingan, prominent In the early history of the country, who had been a clerk in the register's office since the twen ties, was the chief clerk, and filled that po sition for about a quarter of a century. William H. West, afterward chief clerk of the department; Samuel Bootes of George town, Dr. C. W. Handy, Hopkins Light ner of Lancaster, Pa.; Henry Brookes of Virginia, and Jonathan Guest were then at clerical work, while Maj. W. D. Nutt of Virginia and Anthony McLean of Alex andria had charge of the vault and money rocm, and James Moore, before mentioned, was still assistant clerk and messenger, and Messrs. Jackson and Smith were grow ing old in the service. Following Col. Selden was John Sloane, one of the pioneers of Ohio and an old gen tleman of the most genial, open-hearted disposition. His method of dealing with the clerks is illustrated by the recital of an incident. On one occasion a clerk ap peared promptly at 9 o'clock to ask for leave of absence for the day, according to the rules, and, waiting till he had barel time to keep his engagement, went o without seeing Mr. Sloane, who was a few minutes late. The following day he called on the treasurer and explained how he had taken holiday and asked for it. "That was right," said the good-natured old man; "youve had one day, and when you want another take it and ask for It afterward and you'll be sure of It, but do not 1et your work suffer." Advanced i. Yeas-. Mr. Sloane was well up in years when he entered the treasurership in November, 1850, and served till AprU 6, 1858. His signsa ture, well remembered by some, was a bold, heavy one, and was often referred to as in the class with those of John Hancock and Drake De Kay. He wrote with a goose quill laden with such copious supply of ink that the standing joke in the office was that the contractor for stationery was mak ing more profit on his ink than on blank books, paper, &c. Then came in. under Pierces administra tion, Colonel Samuel Casey of Kentucky A pil 4. 1853, and he serv-ed through that administration and into that of Mr. Bu chanan, till December 22, 1850, when Ge-n eral W. C. Price of Missouri was appoint ed, the last of the ante-bellum treasurers. The latter served until March 21, 1861, re signing under Mr. Lincoln. Though the business of the office was on the increase, the clerical force had not in number ex ceeded twenty annually in its sixty years of operation in this city. The growth of business had, however, worked a change, and the free and easy customs disappeared, as the necessity for keeping up the work grew. Indeed, keeping up the business of the office, both on the money and clerica sides, demanded constant attention, a less letter writing and reading of papers was engaged in, and leaves of absence were only obtained by arrangement to have the wcrk kqgt up to date. The treasurers who served prior to 196 are all dead, W. C. Price, who resigned a the, breaking out of the civil war, being the last. But two of the employee under them are living. These are Pay Direor 1'. 0. Crosby, U. S.
