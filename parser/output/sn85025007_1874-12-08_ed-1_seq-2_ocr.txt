ALEXANDRIA, VA. TUESDAY, UKCKMBfK The report of Attorney beoeril \\ illiatus states that iu the civil suits to which the I ? u 11 ed Stares was a party duiiog the pa>t year, the aggregate uwouut oi judgments iti favor ot the United States of these suiis was $>2,021, 724, and the amount actually realized iu these judgments during the last fiscal year was$S6?, fy2. The Attorney General says his total ex penditures were $2,669,730, beiog $301,13i less io the aggregate than the expenditures for these purposes last year. During the fiscal year there was $401,336 less advanced to mar shals for defraying the expenses of courts, their own fees and the fees to jurors anJ wit nesses than for the previous fiscal year, lie says that many of the confederate records and archives are dow io the possession of the gov ernment, and would furnish much valuable evidence to defeat excessive and unjust claims if they could be used. The heads of depart ments having their custody should have au thority to properly certify them, as the records of other departments are now certified; and they should be competent evidence, their cred ibility and conclusiveness to be determined by the judges from all the facts and proofs in the case. An American, now a resident of Paris writes to Washington that Minister Washburn is quite outspoken in discussing the causes which led to the Democratic successes at the recent elections and believes that the agitation of the third term was one of them. That President Grant expects another re-election Minister Washburne does not believe; but at the some time he is free to say that he would not support General Grant were he again acrndidate, believing that it was never intended by the framers of the Constitution that any man should occupy the Presidential chair three times in succession. Mr. Washburne further said that he thought President Grant had made a serious mistake in not promptly declaring before the election that he was not a candidate again for the position to which he has twice been called. Telegrams from Vicksburg report that yes terday several bodies of armed negroes attempt ed to take possession of the court house iD that city, where the sheriff was held under arrest. A conflict took place, and Gov. Ames' Adju tant General telegraphed Gen. Emory, at New Orleans, that the State militia was powerless to quell the disturbance. A later telegram says seven hundred negroes attacked the city that morning on three different roads leading to it. They were driven back wit'i a loss of twenty five killed and . wouoded and forty prisoners. The whites lost eleven killed and two wouoded. The attack was made for the purpose of rein stating Crosby, sheriff, who was requested to resign because' he had not given bond. Necroes in the country are reported as burning dwel lings and gin houses. That portion of the President's message, iu reference to affairs in Louisiana and Arkansas, which is published in full in to-day's Gazette, reads more like the emaoations from a "South ern Republican Convention" or a ''State or County Executive Committee" than the words of "truth aud soberness" from the "head of the nation" who at least, would be supposed to be^cogoizunt of all the facts, and not imposed upon by the stories of "outrage" and "'wrongs," made up io most cases for par tizan purposes. It is certainly not calculated to increase the "love and respect" which should be entertained for the chief magistrate, by the people, whose "love and respect" is worth hav ing, as far as the South is coucerned at least.

Congress.?io the Senate, yesterday, Mr. Morrill reported from the Special Committee an entirely new scheme of government for the District of Columbia, embracing a system of Municipal Boards, the chief of whom shall be three Regents, to be appointed by the Presi dent and confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Sher jnan submitted a bill for the revision of the Custom laws. Among other bills introduced was one for the relief of Ihe Western sufferers by the ravages of the grasshoppers, and anoth er to break up the importation of Ciiiuese into California under a system of slavery. In the House of Representatives a number of the new members who had been elected to fiil vacancies were sworn in. Six of the ap propriation bills were reported and days fixed for their consideration by the House. These,and the amounts named in them, were as follows: Legislative, Executive and Judicial, $19,653, 434; Army, $27,701,500; Iudian, $4.S65,Su7; Fortifications, $850,000; Naval, $16.976,7u6; Consular and Diplomatic, $1,336,035. The total of all these bills is nearly aeventy-one and a half millions of dollars. Mr. Phelps endeavor ed to introduce a bill for the repeal of the Po laud gag law of the last session, but he was cu; off by Mr. Butler. Mr. Cox reminded Mr. Butler that his (Cex's) side of the House would noon be io the majority. After this remark the House adjourned, Mr. Phelps giving notice that he would press bis bill for the repeal of the law. Louisiana and Arkansas*.

"I understand that the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution was made to prevent ibis aud like state of things, aud the act o! May 31, 1S70, with amendments, was passed to enforce it* provisions?the object of boih being to guarautee to all citizens the right to vote and to protect them io the free enjoyment ot that right. Enjoined by the Constitution "totake care that the laws be faithfully executed, ' and convinced by undoubted evidence that vio lations of said act had beeu committed, aud that a widespread and flagrant disrogaid of it was contemplatuU, the proper officers were in structed to prosecute the offenders, and troops were stationed at couveni'-n- points to aid t!ic-re officers, if necessary, in the pert''.nuance of their official duties.

Another trouble has arisen in Atkausas. Article 13 of the constitution of thaf Siaie (which was adopted in 1 SG.s, and upon the ap proval ot which by Congress the Stale was re stored to representation as one oi u.e Mates til the Union) provides in effect that hcMre any amendments proposed to this constitution >h.iii become a part thereof they shut' be passed 1>} two successive Asseuibiies, and then Hu.tuitteU to, and ratified by a majority of elector.* oi the State voting thereon. On the J lib ot May, 1>74. the Governor convened an extra session of the General Assembly of the S aie, which, on the 18th day of the same mouth, passed au act providing for a convention to frame a new constitution. Pursuant to this act, and at au election held on the 3<'.h ot June. I8i4, ihe convention was approved, and delegate- Were chosen thereto, who assembled on the 14 ii of last July and foimed a new constitutiuu, she schedule of which provided tor the election ot an entire new set ot fetate (-Inters in a muuue'r^ contrary to the then existing election Jaws ot the State. On the 13ih ol October, 18i4. this constitution, as therein provided, was submit ted to the people for their approval or rej c tion. and according to the election returns was approved by a large maj >ritv of those qiialiti d to vote thereon, and at the same election per sons were chosen to fill all the ^tate, c-.'uni\ and township offices. 1 lie Governor elected in 1S72 tor the term of four years tun ed over his office to the Governor chosen under the new constitution, whereupon the L-euieuant Governor,also elected iu 18 <2 for a term e>l four years, claimiug to act as Governor, and alleging that said proceedings by which the new con stitution was made and a new set ot officers elected, were unconstitutional, illegal and void, called upon uie, as provided iu scctiou 4, arti cle 4, of the Constitution, to protest tbe_State against domestic violence. As Congress is now investigating the political affairs of Arkansas, 1 have declined to interfere, i'lie whole subject of Executive interference with the affairs ot a State is repugnant to public o{ iniou, to the feeling of those who.from their official capacity, must be used in such interposition, and to liiai or those who must direct. Uuless most clear ly on the side of law, such interference became? a crime. With the law to support it. it is c >n demned without a heariug.^ 1 desire, there fore, that all necessity for Executive directi -n in local affairs may become unnecessary and obsolete. I invite the attention, not ol Congress, but of the people of the United States, to the causes ami effects of these un happy questions. Is there uot a disposition on one side to magnify wrongs and ou.rages and on the other ?ide to belittle them or justify them? If public opinion c.u.d be directed to a correct survey of what is, and to n-bilking wrong, and aiding the proper authorities in punishing it, a better state ot feeling would be inculcated, and the sooucr we would have that peace which would leave the States tree indeed to regulate their owu domestic af fairs. I believe on the part of our citizens ot tin; Southern S'.ates?thp better part of them? there is a disposition to be law abidiug, and to do no violeucc, either to individuals or to the laws existing. But do they do right in ignor ing the existence of violence aud bloodshed in re>MaDee to constituted authority? I sympa thize with their pro-trate condition, and would do all iu my power to relieve theuj?acknowl edging that iu some instances they have had uiu.-t trying government* to live under, and very oppressive ones iu the w ?y of taxation for nominal improvements, not giviug benefits <<|U il to (he hardships imposed? but can they pi'<cla m ihetiwlves entirely irresponsible tor tl:i- condition '{ i'hey cannot. \ iolence has been ramp.ui in some localities, and lias either been ju-;.tL.i or denied by those who could h:ive prevented it. The theory is even raised tti.it there to be no furl her intet Terence on tli. part ot the General Government to protect ci.iz -iis ui'lntj a .Statu where the State author ities fail to give protection. This is a great mistake. X\ hilt* I remain Executive ail the laws ol ('ougie>* and the provisions of the C>n s i u:!

I The Financial Question. We gave yesterday a summary of the Presi dent's Message to Congress, but as the i' ioaticial Question is oue iu which all are interested, we Klve the full text of the message on n.at sub jeci: "rfiuee the conveuiny ot Congress one year ago the ualioo has Undergone a piosirailou iu business and industiies ?uch as ha> uot been witnessed with us tor mauy years. A specula tion as to the causes fur this prostration migiu be indulged iu without profit, because as many theories would be advanced a? there would be independent writers?those who expressed their owu views without bom.wing-up.ju iho sun jvct.' Without indulging iu theories a> lu me cause of this prustrauuu, therefore, 1 will call yuur atieutiou oul> to the lact, and to aume plaiu qucstious, as to winch, it w-niid seem, lhere should be no disagreement. Uui'.ug this prostration two essential > 1 uienis ol prosperity have been most abundant- luboi and capital. Both have been largely employed. \> here security has beeu undoubted, capital has been attainable at very moderate rates. N here labor has beeu wanted it has beeu'luunu in abundance, at cheap rales compurcjl win. what of the necessaries and comforts ol hie coUiu be purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements ot prospemy. tnerefore, have not been denied us. A thud mi^nt uo added Our soil and climate are uucquih-d withiu the limits of any contiguous territory under one nationality tur its variety ot pro ducts to feed and clothe a people, and in the atnouut of surplus to *pure to teed ie*s javund peoples. Therefore, with these tacts in view, it seems to me that wise statesmanship at this session of Congress Would dictate legislation ignoring the past, uir.etiug iu proper channels these groat elements ol prosperity to any peo ple. Debt, debt abroad, is the only element that can, with always a souud currency, eutei into our affairs to cause any continued depres sion iu the industries and prosperity ol our people. A great conflict for national existence made necessary, for temporary purposes, the raising of large =uuis ot money, liom whatever source attainable. , . , ,,, . "It made necessary in the wisdom ot Longress -and 1 do not doubt their wisdom in the premises, regarding the uecessiiy ot the times ?to devise a system ot national currency, which it proved to be impossible to keep un a par with the recognized currency ol the civil ized world. This begot a .-pint ot specu.atiou involving ao extravagance and luxury not re quired lor the happiness or prosperity ol a peo ple, and iuvolviug, both directly aud indirectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency being ol fluctuating value, and, therefore, unsafe to hold for legitimate transactions, requiring money, became a subject ol speculation iu itseii. Ihese two causes, however, have involved us in a foreigu indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower aud leuder, which should be paid in coin and according to the bond agreed uood when the debt was cuutraete i?gold oi its equivalent. The good faith ot the ?j^veru went cauuot be violated towardscred.tois with out national disgrace, fcut our commerce should be encouraged; American ship building and carrying capacity increase.!; foreign mar kets sought fur products ot the soil and mauu factories, to the end that we may be able tu pay these debts. \Y here a new market can be created fur the sale ol our products, either u. the soil, the mine or the manufactory, a new means is discovered of utilizing our idle capital and labor to the advantage ot the whole peo ple But iu my judgment the tirst step towards accomplishing' this object is to secure a cur rency of fixed, Stable value; a currency good wherever civiiizuiun reign?; oue wbieti, li it becomes superabundant will) one people will tiud a market with some other; a currency which has as its basts the labor necessary to produce it, which will give to it its value. Uold uud silver are now the recounted medium? ot exchange the civilized world over, and to this we should return with the least practicable de lay. In view of the pledgts ot the American Congress, when our present legal tender sys tem was adopted, aud debt contracted, then, should be no delay-certainly no un?eoe>jar> delay?in Qxiug, by legislation, a method . which we will return to spfrie. Jo the ac complishment of this end I mvue your special attention. 1 believe firmly that there eau U no prosperous and permanent revival o busi ness aud industries until a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out, looking to a re turn to a specie ba.-is. ?'It is easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative classes may think it uf vaiue to them to make so-called money abundant until they can throw a purtiuu of their burdcus upon others. But even these, I believe, would be disappointed in the resuit if a course sh.-uld be pursued which will keep in doubt the vaiue of the legal tender medium ol exchange. A revival ol' productive industry is needed by ah classes ; by nune more than ihe holders of property, ol whatever sort, witii debts to liqui date frum realization upon us sale. l>ut ad mitting that these two classes ?>! citizens are to be benefited by expansion, wouid it tie hon est 10 give it? Wotiid uot the gfuerai lo^ be too jfreat to justify such rc.iel ? Would it n-'t be just as honest and prudent to authorize each debtor to issue his own legal tenders to the extent ot his liabilities? Thai) to do this* wuuld it uot be safer, lor lcar of ovei-n-sues i y unscrupulous creditors, to say that ail o. bi ob ligations are obliterated iu the United S.utes, and uow we commence an^w, each possessing all he has at the time, free ironi incumbrance? These propositions are too absurd to be en tertained lor a moment by thinking or honest people, let every delay iu preparation tor final resumption partakes of this dishonesty, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out chat a convenient reason will at last arrive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commence, it wili never come, in my optuion, except by positive action by Congress, or bv uatioual disasters which will destroy, for a time at least, the credit of the individual and the State at large. "A sound currency might be reached by total bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity ol the nation and of individuals. 4'I believe it is iu the power of Congress at this eession to devise such legislation as wi 1 renew confidence, revive all the industries, start us on a career of prosperity to last many years, and to save the credit of the nation and ol the people. i:teps towards the return to a specie basis are the great requisites to tins de voutly to be sought for end. There are others which I may touch upon hereafter. "A nation dealing in a currency below that if specie in value labors under tw ? great disadvan tages: First, having no use tor the w.-rld's ac knowledged medium of exchange?god and silver?these are driven out uf the eou itry b : cause there is oo demand lor their u-e. Second, the medium of exchange in use being ot atlue tuating value?tor, after all, it is on.}' worth just what it will purchase of goid and silver, metals having an intrinsic value just in propor tion to the honest labor it takes to produce them; a larger margin must be allowed tor pro fit by the manufacturer and producer. "It is months from the date of production tu the date of realization. Interest upon capital j must be charged and risk of fluctuation iu the i vaiue of that which is to be received in pay ment added. Hence high prices, acting as a protection to the foreign producer, who re- j ceives nothing iu exchange for the products of j his skill aud labor except a currency good, at a j stable value, the worid over. "It seems to me that uothing is clearer tiiau ; that the greater part of the burden ol existing : prostration, for the want of a sound financial ' system, falls upou the working man. who must, alter all, produce the wealth and the salaried man who superintends and conducts business. The burden faiis upon them in two ways?by the deprivation of employment and by the de creased purchasing power of ilieir salaries. It is the duty ul Congress to devise ihe method of correcting the evils which are acknowledged tu exist, and not mine. But I will venture to suggest two or three things whieh seem to me as absolutely neces.-ary to :t return to specie pay mem; the first great requisite in a return to prosperity. The legal tender clause to the law uuih rizin^.i he issue of currency by the (Jovern ment should be repealed, to take effect as to all contracts entered into after a day fixed in the repealing act; not to apply, however, to payments of salaries by Government, or for other expenditures now provided by law to be paid in currency in the interval pending be tween repeal and dual resumption. Provision should be made by which the Secretary of the Treasury may obtain gold as it may become ne cessary from time to time from the date when specie redemption commences, To this might aud should be added a reveuue sufficiently in ixce-s of expends to insure an accumulation ul Lr;?ld in the Treasury to susrain peimanent redemption. "1 commend this subject to your careful con* si J?ration, believing that a favorable solution is attainable, and tlmt if reached by this Congress that tiic present and future generations will ever gratelully remember it as their deliverer from a thraldom of evil aud disgrace. "With resumption, iree banking maybe au th'irlz J with safety, giving the same lull pro tection to bili-iioldenrwhich they have uoder existing laws. Indeed. I would regard free banking as essential. It wuuld give proper elasticity to the currency. As more currency should be roquirred for the transaction of legiti mate business new banks wuuld be started, and in turn banks would wind up iheir business wheu it was found that there was a superabun dance of currency. The experience and judg ment of the people can best decide just how much currency is required for the transaction of the business of the country. It is unsafe to leave the settlement of this question to Con gress, the secretary of the Treasury, or the Executive. Congress should make the regula tion under which banks may exist, but should not make banking a monopoly by limiting the amount of redeemable paper currency that shall be authorized. Such importance do I attach to this subject, aud so earnestly do 1 commend it to your attention that I tiive it promiuece by introducing it at the beginning of tbis mes sage." ____ llev.
