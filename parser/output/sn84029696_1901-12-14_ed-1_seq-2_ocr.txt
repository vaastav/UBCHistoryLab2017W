Especial ;ten tion was called to the provision In the preamble of the pending- treaty reserving article 8 of the Clayton-Bul-wer treaty from the repeal provision of the new treaty.

Banks Must Tell The Exact State Of Deposits. 

JUDGES HAD SIMILAR CASES. Topeka, Dec 10.- The supreme court has handed down a decision of interest to bankers. The decision was render ed in the case of the Bock Island Lum ber Company against the Fourth National bank of Wichita. The com pany gurnisheed the bank for a claim which a man named Joselyn pwed it. The bank replied that Joselyn had no money on deposit. It wa proven later that he did have, but that it was de posited in the name of Joselyn as president of the police board. The president of the police board had no right to the possession of police funds, and the lumber company contended that it was simply a way he had of elnding it: that the money really be longed to him and was subject to garnishment. Banks, as a rule, deny liability in order to protect their de positors. In this case the supreme court took special occasion to lay down a new rule for banks to follow. It is that, when a garnishment is run, the bank must make a full reply showing what the depositor has on deposit, whether it is deposited in his name or as trustee.' In fact, the bank must tell under oath the exact status of the de posit. The length to which the court went In this decision is due to some experi ence the judges themselves had in litigation of that kind when they were practicing- law. It developed in the discussion of the case that nearly all of the judges at some time or other had had trouble in finding out from the banks the status of the accounts of litigants, and in order to stop such practice the court went a step further than it really was called upon to do. Justice Pollock wrote the opinion. At Kansas City Next. Chicago, Dec 9.
