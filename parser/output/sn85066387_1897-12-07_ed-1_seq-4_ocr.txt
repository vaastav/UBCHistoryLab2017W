There are under construction five bat tleships, iir*t class, sixteen torpedo-boats and one submarine boat. No provision lias re I been made for the armor of three of the five bat tleships, as it has been impossible to obtain It at the price fixed by Congress. It is of great importance that Congri si provide this armor, as until then the ships are of no fighting value. The present naval fore, especially In riew of its Increase The People Approve the New Navy. by ships now under construction, while not iis large as that of a few other powers, is a formidable force; its vessels are tiie very best of each type; and with the Increase that should be made to it from time to time in the future, nnd careful attention to keeping it In n high state of efficiency and repair, it is well adapted to the necessities of the c< uniry. The groat increase of the navy which lias taken place in recent years was justified by iho requirements lor naval defense, mid has received public approbation. The lime has row arrived, however, when this increase, to which the country is committed, should for a time take the form of increesefi facilities com mensurate with the increase of our naval ves sels. It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dock on tiie Pacific coast capable of docking our largest ships, and only one on tne Atlantic coast, and that the latter has for the last six or seven months bsen under re pair, and therefore incapable ot use. Imme dißte steps should bo taken to provide three or four dock-t o; this capacity on the Atlantic coast, at least one on the Pacific coast, and a floating dock on the Gull. Ihis is the recom mendation ol a very competent board ap poin'ed to Investigate the subject. There should also be ample provision made for powder and projectiles and other muni tions of war and for an increased number ot ■ (fieers mi enlisted men. j-oiue additions are also necessary to our Davy-yards loathe re pair and cure of our largrr number of vessels.

The act of Congress extending to Alaska the mining laws of the United States contained the reservation that it should not ba construed to put in force the general land laws of the country. By an act approved March 3, 1891! authority was given for entry of lands for towosite purposes, and also for the purcnase of not exceeding 100 acres then or thereafter occupied for purposes of trade and manufacture. The purpose of Congress as thus fur expressed has been that only such rights should apttly to the Territory cs should be specifically name.!. lt will be seen how much remains to be done for that vast and remote and yet promising' portion of our country. Special authority was Riven to the President by the act of Con gress proved Jujv 24, 1897, to divide that Territory into two land districts and to desig nate the boundaries thereof and to appoint registers and surveyors of said "and offices, nd tbe President was also authorized to appoint a Surveyor-General for the entire district. Pursuant to this authority, a Surveyor-General and Receiver have been appointed, offices at Bitk •.. If In the ensuing year the condi tions justify it, the ad.litionul land district authorized by law will be established, with an office *t some point in the Yukon Valley. Mo appropriation, however, was made (or tills purpose, and that is now necessary to be done for the two land distr.cts into which the Ter ritory Is to te divided. 1 concur with tue Secretary of War in his suggestions i s lothe necessity for a military force in the Territory of Alaska ior the protec tion of persons and property. Already ajbrnall f'.rce, consisting of twenty-rive men with two officers, under command of Lieutenant- Colonel Ranuai: of the E.ghth Infantry, has teen sent to St Michael to establish c. mil; tary post. As it is to the interest of the Government to encourage the development and seti.ement of the country a::d its duty to Ullovv up its citi- Eens there with the benefits of legal machin ery, 1 earnestly ur^e upon Congress the establishment of a system of government of suf h flexibility as wil. enable it to iiclj-m it self to the iuiure areas oi yreaiest population. The startling, though possibly exaggerated reports irom ibe Yukon River country, of the probable shortage of food lor the large num ber of people who are wintering there without the means of leaving the country, are confirmed in such measure as to justily bringing the matter to the attention of Con gress, Access to that country this winter can be ha.l only by the pass's from Dye* and Vicinity, which is a most difficult and perhaps an impossible task. However, should these reports of the suffering oi our fellow-citizens be further verified, every effort at any cost 6hou.d be made to carry them relief. For a number of years past it has been apparent that .Take Citizens of the Civilized Indians. the conditions un der which the five civilized tribes were established in the Indian Territory un der treaty prov.sions with the United States, with the right of fclf-government nnd the exclusion of at. white person irom within their borders, have undergone so complete a change as to renaer the continuance of the system thus iuaug-iratea pracuouily impossi ble. The total number of the five c \ tribes, as shown by the last census, is 4r>,4',>4, and this, number has not materially increMi d, while U:e white population i* estimated at from 200.000 to 

ZSO.OOO, which, by permis sion of ihe Indian (lovernmen t, nas settled in the Terri ory. Tbe present area oi the Indian Territory contains 25,694,564 acres, much of which is very fertile .and. The U .itfd St.-ites citizens residing in the Territory, most of whom have gone there l>? invitatiou or will: the consent of the tribal authorities, have made permanent homes for themselves. Numerous towns have been built, in which from 500 to 5000 wnite reopie now reside. Valuable residence* and busirieis-h.>uses have been erected in many of them. Large busi ness enterprises are carried on, in which vast gums of mouey are employed, and yet these people wno have invested their capital la the development oi the productive resources of the country are Without the title to t:ie land they occupy aud have no voice whatever in the government cither of the nations or tribes. Thousands of their children, who were born in the Territory, are of scnool age, but the doors of the schools of the nations are shut p.gainst them and what education they get is by private contribution. No p.-ovision for the protection of the Ufa or property of these white citisens is made by the tribal govern ments and courts. The Secretary of the Interior reports that leading Indians huve absorbed great tracts oi land to the exclusion of the common people, a:id government by an Indian aristocracy hns been practically established, to the detriment of the people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keep its citizens out of tbe Territory, and the executory conditions contained in treaties with these nations have for the most part become impossible of execu tion had it been possible for the tribal govern ment to secure each individual Indian liis full enjoyment in common with other Indians of the common property of the nation*. Friends ot the Indians have long believed that the beat interests of the IndUns of the five civil ized tribes would be found in American citixenship, with ail the rights and privileges which belong to that condition. By section 16 of ihe act of March 3, 1893. the President was authorized to appoint three Commissioners to enter into negotiations with ne Cherofcee, Cboctaw, Oaickasaw, llustojoo (or CreeK) anil seminole nations, commonly known as (Iks live civilized tribes in the In; diau Territory. . Briefly, the purposes o; he negotiations were the extinguishment. of the tribal title to any lands' within lh»t Territory now held by nny and ail such nations or tribes, either by cession of the same or boom part thereof to the United States, or by allot ment or by the division of sum'; ia severally aiuonir the Indians of such nations or tribes respectively, as may be entitled to the same, or by such other method as may be agreed upon between the several nations and tribes a oresald, or each of them, with the United States, with a view to such an Adjustment, upon the basis of justice and equity, us may, with the consent of tbf; said nations of the Indians, si far as may be necessary, requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creation of a State or States of the Union, which snail embrace the lands within said Indian Terri .ory. Tlie commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indians were very »;o\v lo act, and those in control manifesto l a de cided dlsineliutftijn to meet with favorite proposition'- submitted to them. A little moro than three years this organization (the com mission) effected an agreement with tne Choc taw nation alone. Tne Chickasaws have re fused to agree to its terms, and, a* they have a common interest with the Choctawi in the lands of said nations, the agreement with the latter nation could not have been with the consent of the former. April 23, 1897, the commisiion effected an agreement with both tribal — the Choctaws and Cttickasaws. This agreement, it is understood, has been ratified by the constituted authorities of the re spective tribes or nations or parties thereto, and only requires ratification by Congreas to make it binding. On the 27th of September, 1897, an agree ment whs effected with the Creek nation, but it is understood that the National Council refused to ratify the same. Negotiation* are yet to be had with tne Cherokee*, the most populous of the live civilised tribes, and with the Seaiinoles, the smallest in point of numbers and territory. The provision in the Indian appropriation act, approved June 10, 1890, makes it the duty of the commission to investigate and ac- termine the r-.gh.is of applicants for citizen ship in the live civilized tnb*s. The commis sion la at present engaged in this work among the tribes, and has made appointments for taking the census ol these people up to aud including the 30:h of the present month. Should the agreement between tbe Choc taws and CliiCKasnw, be ratified by Congress and should the oilier trihes tail to make an agreement with them, then it will be neces sary that tome leui.-lat ion . shail be had by congress, which, while just and honorable to the Indians, snail Le eijuitab c to the white people who have settled upou these lands by invitation of, the tribal nations. Hon. lleury 1. Dawes, chairman of the commission, in a letur to the Secretary of the Interior, under date of October 11, 1897, says: ••Individual ownership is in their (the commission.-) cpmion absolutely essential to any permanent improvement in present conditions, and the lack of it is the root of nearly all the evils which have so grievously afflicted these people. Allotment by Agreement is the only possible method unless the United States court! rre clothed with the authority to apportion the lands among the c.tizen Indians for whoso u-e it was originally granted." I concur with the Secretary of the Interior that there can be no cure for the evils engen gendered by the operation of these great trusts excepting- their re.-umptlon by the Government which created them. Tne recent preva lence of the yellow fever ia the number | of cities and towns Urgent Need for Better National Quarantine. throughout the South has resulted In much disturbance of commerce ana demonstrated the necessity of such amendments to our quarantine laws as will mnke the regulations of the national quarantine authorities para, mount. The Secretary of the Treasury, in that portion of his report relating to the operation of the marine hospital service, calls attention to the defects in the present quarantine luws and recommends amendment-* thereto which j will give the Treasury Department the requi site uuinoritv to prevent the invasion of the epidemic diseases irom foreign countries and in times of emergency like that of the past summer will acid to the efficiency of the sani tary measures lor the protection of the people ai;d at the same time prevent unnecessary re strictions of commerce. I concur in his rec ommendation. In further effort to prevent the invasion of the United States by yellow fever the import ance of the discovery of the exact cause of the disease, which up to the present time has been undetermined, has been obvious, and to mis end • systematic Dac.eriogical Investiga tion should be made. I iheretore recommend that Congress authorize the appointment of j a commission by the President, to consist of four expert bacteriologists, one to be selected from the medical officers of the Marine Hos pital service, one to be appointed from civil life, one to be detailed from the medical offi cers of the army and one irom the medical officers of the navy. The Union Pacific Hallway, jntin line, was sold under the decree of the United States Court for the District of Nebraska on the Ist and ill of November, this year. The amount due the Government consisted of the prin cipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, and the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,711 75, making the total indebtedness 58,4.48,223 75. The bid at the sale covered the f:rst-mont;age lien and the entire mortgage claim of the. Government prlnclal and interest. The sole of the subsidized por tion of the Kan sas Pacific line, Governme nt Ready to Buy the Kansas Pacific. upon which the Governmejt ho;ds a second mortgege lien, has been postponed ai tne in stance of the Government to Decemi»«r 16, 1897. The debt of this division of the Union I'aciflc Railroad to the Government on .No vcmb r 31, 1897, was the principal of the i>ub >idy bonds, $6 303 000, and the unpaid and accrued interest. f8.626.6M 33, making a total of $12,9^9,090 33. The sale of this roaJ was originally adver. tised for November 4. but ior the purpofco of se curing the moil public not!reolthe event of the postponement unt:l D^cemb r 16, a«ec oud advertisement of the sale \\ as made. By the decree of 'lie rourt the upset price of the kansns Paclfie will yield to tbe Government the sum of $2,500,000 over ail prior liens, costs and charges. Ii no other or better bid is made this sum is all that the Government will receive on Us claim of nearly $13,000, --000. • The Government has no information as to whether there will be other bidders or another bid than the maximum amount herein stated. The question preen ted, there ore, is whether the Government shall under the authority given It b,-the net of March 13, 1889, pur chase or redeem the road in the event that a bid is not made by private parties covering, the entire Government claim. To qualify the Government to bid at the sales wi i require a deposit of $900,000, «is follows: In the Gov ernment cause' ssoo,ooo, and In each of the first mortgage causes $200,000, and in the Infer the deposit must be in cash. Payments at the rale are as follows: Upon the accept* ance of the bid a sum which with the amount already deposited (halt equal 15 percent of the bid. the balnece in Installments of 25 per cent, thirty, forty and fifty flays afier the con firmation of the sale. Tne Men on the Kansas Pacific prior to that of the Government on the 30th cf July, 1897, principal and Interest, amounted to $7,281,048 11. The Govern ment, therefore, should it become the highest bidder will hove to pay the amount of the fir-t mortcage lien. I believe that under the act of 1887 it lies the authority to do this and in the absence 'of .any action by Congress. I shall direct the Secretary of the Treasury to make the necessary deposit as required by the court's decree to qualify as a bidder and to b d at the sale a sum which will at least equal the principal of the debt due to tbe Government, but suggest in order to remove all controversy that en amendment of the law be immediately passed, explicitly giving such powers and appropriating in general terms whatever sum is sufficient therefor. ■ In so important a matter as the Government becoming the probable owner of railroad property, which it perforce must conduct and operate, 1 feel constrained to lay before Con gress these fuels for its consideration, and act before ita<: consummation of '.h« sale. It is clear to my mind that the Government should not permit the property to be sold at a price THE SAX

Th c important brmch of our Gov ernment known as the Civil Service, Civil Service Reform a lirowing Success. practical improvement of which has long been a subject of earnest d scn-siuii, has oi late years received increased legislative and execu tive > pproval. During the past few months the service has been placed on a still firmer b— ls oi bus in Ma methods and p-rsoual merit. While the right ol our veteran so. fliers to re instatement in deserving cases has been as serted, dismissa.s for merely political reasons have been carelully guarded against, the ex aminations for admittance to the service en larged and at the tame time rendered less technical and more practical; and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing beiore dismissal upon all cases where incom ■petency is charged or removal of official* demanded, in any of the departments. This order has beeD made to give to the accused li is right to be heard without in any way im pairing th« power ol removal, which should always be exercised in cases of inefficiency and incompetence', and which is one ol the vital safeguards of the civil service reform system, preventing stagnation aud dead wood and keeping every employe keenly aiive to the fact t tm t the security of his tenur.- depends not on favor but on iiis own tested and care tuny watched record of service.

I am forced by the length of this message to omit many important references lo affairs of the Government with which Congress will have to deal at the present session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all ol which I invite your earnest attention. The <s:imates of the expenses of the Gov ernment by the several departments will, 1 am sure, have your careful scrutiny. Whi c Congress may lind it an easy task to reduce the expenses of the Government, it should not encourage their increase. These expenses Will, in my judgment, admit of a decrease In many branches of the Government without injury to the public service. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the receipts of the Government and thus avoid a deficit, 

WILLIAM M( KINI.KV. EiF.rtTivE Mansion, December o, 1997 CONGRESSMEN TALK ON THE MESSAGE WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— Senators were r-enerally averse to expressing any opin ion upon the message. Senator Roach was an exception to tbe rule arming Democrts. He called especial attention to the President's deil irution that the Government i pledged to maintain cold redemption. ••This," he said, ''is a mere assumption. We have not a single obligation which is not explicitly redeemable in 'coin,' the word 'gold' being mentioned in none of tiiem." Senator White (D.) of California, mem ber of the Finance Committee, was dis posed to lake the message jocularly, lie said:. '•The message is very elaborate, though its conclusions are somewhat veiled. I regret that 1 cannot agree with the President's Hawaiian notions and that he has tailed to inform us what we ought to do concerning Secretary Gage's great currency reform i Lin. lam glad to observe that he adApts the views I have frequently urged regarding Cuba and ex ecutive jurisdiction upon the subject of j i belligerency." Views by Republican Senators were ex pressed as follows: Senator Allison — I do not take tne de spairing view concerning our currency which the President presents. While there are tome improvements which 1 would like to see made, 1 think we shall be able to get along if we do not get any currency legislation, and as the situation presents itself now, it looks as it it might be impracticable to secure legislation on the line- of the President* recommenda tions. The recommendations in regard to Cuba ara hum- ne and considerate. Senator Hale — The recommendation in regard to Cuba is in ail respects admirable, and one with which lam much pleased. On the subject of the finances the Presi dent does not press for immediate action, and. as for myself, I do not believe that such would be possible under ttie circum stances. Senator Hoar— lt struck me as a wise, compact and carefully considered docu ment. .; : "■ ; Senator Foraker As a whole the mes sage is an able document, but I do not agree with the President's conclusions on the subject of international law as applied to Cubb. Senator Chandler — I am especially pleased With the President's evident in tention to maintain a policy in the inter est of international bimetallism. Senator Harma — It is a statesmanlike and American paper; impressive and con vincing, and one which will confirm the confidence the country has in the Presi dent. Senator Smith (D.)— While some of the President's recommendations with regard to the currency may be well enough it must be e7ident to him that at the pres ent time they are impossible of enactment. His reference to bonds is painfully stigte - live of the inadequacy of the present tariff law, and while his policy in regard tv Cuba seems moderate I tiarctly think it is in line with the supposed policy of the Republican party. • Senator Allen (Pop.) — I do not care to enter upon a ciittcism of the President's utterances, but I will ivy that I fall to a?ree with him on his three principal sug gestions of policy. Senator Toller (Sil. R.)— l do not believe that any legislation will be enacted au thor zinc the retention of the greenbacks in the treasury until somebody is willing to pay cold for them. The ralical advo cates of the gold standard will not be* will ing to accept this suggestion, nor will the sliver men, so tar as I am informed, tavor "this disposition of the financial question. It may be that the administration may be willing to go on further to meet the de mand? of i be so-called currency reform ers. But, judging from the utterances of the Secretary of the Treasury, tie will be willing to make further concessions. . Ido not believe that the suggestion for the tying up of the greenbacks will meet the approval o: the people, as such a course would inevitably result in great contrac tion of the currency. Indeed, it looks to me as if the suggestions of the President Would not be satisfactory jto any great number of people of any party. Tti" President is certainly mistaken when he says the Government i« onliged to redeem Us obligations in gold. It Ims b*en the nolicy of the administration to so redeem, but there i* no coruj ■•u.siou on this ■ oint. Senator Pettitrrew (Sil. R.)— The Presi dent proposes to retire the greenbacks, an I in doing so tie tries to disguise the method by which It is to be accomplished. It is plain that if the President's pan is adopted, no more greenbacks can be in circulation than there is col I in the treas ury. Thus the greenbacks virtually be - \ come gold certificates arid will be immedi ately retired. Representative Doiliver (R.) of lowa said: "The President's message is a clear and conservative statement of the national situation. A* to -the currency question the President's omis-ion to ur:re in detail the most radical reforms pro posed by Secretary Gage indicates thru lie will exercise a good deal of charity to war I Congress if that body sr.ould fail to got tocether on the question." Representative hit (R ) of Illinois, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Aflairs — The message show* that the President has promptly and effectively acted on the Cuban question, i He has pressed upon the attention of the Spanish Government the nijiiri. s our bus ness in terests were suffering, toe ini ' nsonment of American citizens, the barbarous war fare under Weyler and nee.l of change in the mode of government in Cuba. The result has been the release of every im prisoned American; the removal and dis grace of Weyler; lie end of the concen tration and starvation policy and the presentation of a system of self-govern ment largely based* on that of Ci.nai'.a. When our suggestions have thus all been accepted and are being carried out in ap parent goo 1 laith, which is shown by the opposition in Spain, he wisely thinks that good faith on our part requires that we let the measure we ourselves suggested be tried at least until we can see whether the Cubans themselves will be satisfied. The situation is vastly different from that of a year ago. .- v ! . ' : Representative Walker (R.) of Massa chusetts, chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency, said, us to the financial features of the menage: "1 fear the message is not sufficiently specific and does not go far enough to relieve the situ ation. It does not recommend that any thing shall be done until the revenues ex ceed the expenditures of the Govern ment, winch may be many months in the future and is far from immediate action. Secondly, the recommendation that green backs be not paid out except for gold, when once redeemed in gill, if enacted into law, would enable one man with $1,000,000 of greenback* demanding gold of the treasury and then. depositing the gold in the bank for greenbacks, and, re peating th«» process 34b" times, to retire the whole $34G.000,000 in the time it would take him to oscillate between the sub treasury in New York and his confederate foreign brokers. The recommendation that banks be required to redeem their notes in i!O4d, with no other provision of Jaw, would cause every bank in the country to surren der its circulation, and then what agency would keep the country on a gold basis?" Representative Henderson (R.) of lowa — I an. pleased with the President's mes sage becau-e it meets clearly and squarely every vital and pressing question. On the money question lie is c.ear, stating our situation witn marked intelligence, point ing out our dangers and making certain recommendations that would cert&inly, if adopted, present, lor c lie present, atleast, disasters that we have experienced in the past. On the Cuban question his. course has been active, intelligent, patriotic and wise. • i v i Representative Hull (R.) of lowa, chair man of the touirniitee on Military Affaira — Tbe recommendations *s to currency reform are more mo ler.ite than 1 ex pects d. 1 cordially indorse the President's position as to the Ha* a. inn Islands, but cannot agaee to bis su^ges'jonaas to Cuba. Representative Bland (D ) of Mis souri, the recognized Free ti ver Detao cra.ic leader, s.ua : "The Presideni's pro position io retire the iireenb.icii by bokl tog tliein la the treasury rxcept for >;old deiiosit-, means a contruction oi the cur rency to the amount oi the greenbacks so impounded. His statement of the situa tion as to international bimetallism will n)t De accepted in earnest by anybody. Ti.ere are few serious International bi metallisia, but among them I -uppo-e the I'resident may ti- ela^Md as one. The message on a subjects sounds uj olovetic rdcl like an atlid v.t lo.'cotiiiniunce." Rep-vseii;auve Cox (D.) of i>nne see. trie ranking Demo ' member of the Coruruuiee on lianking and Currency — The message in regard to the currency in my judgment ii an' inter failure. If the policy advocate I was carried our inio law it could omy result me contraction of the currency. Under the arguments made by the President it would be the duty of the Government to redeem silver in gold on the application of the holder of silver as readily as it does the United Stasis notes*. So if ev*ry paper dollar of the Government was retired the raid eon id to mad* on the Treasury just as we.l with silver. In regard to the recom mendations as to banking they are ot such a character that no lju-,.ne¥s bant would do ousinesa under such law. THE

LONDON, Dec. 7.— The Daily Tela t;rapli, commenting e»Jiu>riallr on Presi dent McKinley's message this inorninj.-, •ays : It used to be America's proud boast that she had no foreign policy. Judging lrom Pres: lent MiKiuley's message the New World is no m< ru free from the burdens of diplomatic ne t;otintii>us than ".lie <> d. 1:: a document ot portentous length, mostly intended for Spanish consumption. President McKin. has devised a apcctoM pretext for valuing time. It contains passages that will certainly wound Spain's national susceptiblli> ;i«-8. The whole tone, though meant to be concil iatory, savors too much of the magistrate availing himself of the first offender's act 10 be very acceptable at Madrid.

Moreover, there are serious daggers of rev -0 ullon In Spain, and the lodi<creet adjectives President McKiniey applies to General Wey ler's policy will not lessen the latter* popu lariiy. Much depends upon the attitude of ( oner ss. It, as our correspondent thinks the jingoes acquiesce )u the decision of the executive and Rive the Spaniards a chance, all may yet be well, bat recent experience does not niMtce us over sanguine. The Diilv Mail mv» it is very patisfnetory that President MeKiuley comas out so strongly ■gains* ih- jingoes. The I) lily chronicle describes the message as "weak and colorless, compared wi:h he vigorous handling of public questions to which Mr. Cleveland accustomed us." Ii says: "The explanation of this is nun pie. Mr. Cleveland was in front 01 Congress: McKm ley is behind it. The President's comments on tho currency issue are positively c u.iilike in their simplicity. In, safe to prophesy that his treatment oi the Cuban question will be received with a storm. Tne. annexation of Cuba would be a deplorable mistake, -but th ■ reas ons (or refraining Ir 'in that cour»a are not the milk and water oues Mr. McKiniey ad vances." Tin- Morning Post, after paying a tribute to the President's fine sense of duty in the face of domestic trouble in >endiug »hu message at the appoluled hour, says: Tnu messaee adumbrates a sciieme ol legislative. effort lens short-sighted and less calculated to -etc.ays against cUss than the misguided policy oi the last session.

The editorial specifically praises President MrKinley's treatment of the currency ques tion. l >!- { r : ;'.\ Tho Times says: Its tone of patronizing to er ance will make the message nut wholly agree abln to Spain. I'roOubly the President cal culates tiiat if he can satisfy the jingoes for it time with eloquent denunciation.' and warn ings he will liv i it easier to pursue a moderate policy. Regarding his currency proposals,!; stems tco probable that Mr. McKlnley still clings to the noiiou that something may by done silvar.

QUIET AT HAVANA AS ONE RESULT. HAVANA, Dec. 6 —The summary of President McKiniey's message, published in the afternoon papers, exercised a dis tinctly caimitiK effect on the sentiment of vague unrest which han prevailed at Havana during the la->t few duys. Ex pressions o satisfaction because of the dignified, conservatve tone of the mes sage are heard on all sides.

Among the American colony apprehen sions of popular demonstration arising from the possibility of resentment at American interlerenoe were laid at rest. On the part of Cuban sympathizers some disappointment was expressed, on: in this c eiuent the action of the I'resi dent was generally foretold and dis counted. Secretary-General Congosto told me, speaking ior Captain-General Blanco, that the utterances of the President were in ganeral viewed with satisfuctiun ; their only objection to the message being that its rhrusing might possitKv leave many looph jles on which false hopes might be founded by the supi oners of the policy oi in'.er.erence. "In other respects," said Secretary Con jrosto, "we have notning bat praise for the attitude of Mr. McKinley."
