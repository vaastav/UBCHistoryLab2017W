HISREPORT TELLS IT ALL TheComptroller of the Currenov^Learnedly Advises the Govern^^ment and the Amerloan^People About Money. Washington,Dee. 2.^The report of the^Hon. James H. Eekels, comptroller of the^currency, aubinitted to-day. five* full in^^formation in regard to the organisation,^supervision and liquidation of the, national^bank* for the rear ended Oct. 81.1891. It^above that during this period but 60 banka^vera organised with e capital stock of^$6,285,030, the smallest number chartered,^ea wall as the minimum amount of capi^^tal. In any one year since 1879. Oftbeee new banks i7 ere in the north^^ern and eastern elates, 10 in the southern^states, and 18 in the western, or Trans-^missiseippt division. OnOct. 81, 1884, the total number of na^^tional banks in operation wee 3.786, with^an authorised capital stock of $072,671,385. Duringthe year 79 banka, with an ag^^gregate capital stock of $10,473,030 passed^out of the system by voluntary liquidation \^31, including two which failed in 1893 with^a capital stock of 83,770,000, became In^^solvent and were placed In charge of re^^ceivers. Thefeature of the comptroller's report^is bis discussion of the eurreney question^and the defects which are said to exist ia^the note issuing powers rested in the na^^tional banks. On this subject be saysi^^No section of the law should be disturbed^which cannot be matierially Improved^upon, and no amendment engrafted un-^is sueb amendmente will work eat^better results than follow from the Mist^^ing order of things. Fromthe present law It must be eon-^ceded it has been eucceeful in every ma^^terial feature except in the matter of the^bank note issue, and here the failure has^been but e partial one. The notes issued^by the banks undsr governmental super^^vision have been uniform in appearance^and under any and all circumstances good^for the full face value which they purport to^carry. They have possessed the first re^^quisite of a good bank note leese^imme^^diate convertibility Into coin upon pre^^sentation. ''Itia probable there could be no better^plan for simply insuring the note holder^against loss than the present require^^ment of a deposit of bonds to secure a^bank's circulation. Bet It is equally oer-^tain, however, that a method oould be de^^vised, not less safe in this respect, and in^addition thereto, possessing that which Is^essential and is now wholly wanting^^elasticity of issue. The complaint, there^^fore, made against the present system is^that, lacking in elasticity of issue, It fails^to meet ae fully as it ought the varying^waste of the country's trade and com^^merce. Butserious as Is tbla fault sad retard-^ful aa it ia to the business In this country,^any attempt to remedy it which should^lose eight of or In any wise make lose cer^^tain the present unqueationed credit and^convertibility of the bank iasuee of the^country, could net be justified. It Is a^duty of the government to see that the^eurreney wbieh circulates among the peo^^ple shall always be of the very highest^character, the soundness of which should^never be a subject of inquiry. For SO^years the Amencen people have bad each^a bank eurreneysaws' having seen iho value^of It both here and abroad, they will^not be content to have any innovation^made unless such new departure insures^not only equal but better results. Itis respectfully suggested that not^only as good but better results would be^attained if the present bsnk act were^amended by repealing the provision^thereof requiring eaeh bank ae a prere^^quisite to entering the system, and Issu^^ing bank note currency, to deposit gov-^ernment bonds. In lieu of such a pro^^vision, should be substituted one permit^^ting the banks to issue circulating notes^against their assets to an amount equal to^at least 60 per cent, of their unimpaired^capital. Thecomptroller follows the suggestion^with the further recommendation for the^maintenance of a safety fund to be pro^^vided by graduated tasation upon the out^^standing circulation of the banks, until^the same shall not be less than 5 per cent^of the total of aueh outstanding circula^^tion ; this fund to be betd by the govern^^ment as an agent only, and for the pur^^pose of immediately redeeming the notes^of insolvent banks. The comptroller^says: ^Whatever other changes, if any,^it would be necessary to make in the pres^^ent system relative to current redemption^of bank notes and the government's^position toward the eame and kindred^matters, it is uot necessary to set forth,^If the recommendations here made^together with that which follow should^receive con skiers lion at the hands of con^^gress, a bill drawn, after careful study^and investigation of tbe whole subject,^would necessarily embody all the details^incident to the change from tbe bond to^tbe safety fund, necessary as a basis of^bank circulation. Tbecomptroller then eitea such proof^and gives such statistics as seem to him^to make tho plan suggested a perfectly^safe one to enter upon. Continuing, tbe^compiroller says: ^Tho profit upon the^issue of circulation to tho banks by sucb^a change would be ^ ^ augmented thai it^is giving to them ^ franchiso for which it^is suggested they should he callod upon to^make- proper return to IBS gmeral gov^^ernment. Til.I return should no!, how^^ever, be of such a character a* to ilclcat^the ends eou.dit kg the privilege given.^The currency redemption of tho legal^; leader leeues ami treasury itittos tin ler the act of 1880, an l the resssuHsg instead^I ef eseeoiietieu of the asase, must always^create a distrust of the governments^rred.t abroi 1 and at home so long as the^law^ upon *!i^ statute books remain un-^change!. Hiegenera! government ought to be^wholly fre^ trom the direct issuing an I re-^deemmgof notes to pass aa money among thepeople. Me government has ever yet^successfully eugaged in so doing end the^experience of the government ef the^United States has proved no exception to^the rule. Tbe general cost and loss en-^toiled upon tbe government end the period^of uncertainty to the government's credit^and the stability of our raswstsrj system^have been ee great aa to mass the legal^tender and treasury issues or let; one of^tbe extraordinary burdens placed on the^people. Tbeee iseuea ought (^ he re^^deemed and cancelled end the fevers-^most thus enabled to retire from the^banking business, a business fee which it^Is so poorly equipped. Inthe light of iho present condition of^the government's finances.^ the comp^^troller continues, ^thai wbieh eoghi to^have been done when there wee a surplus^in tbe treasury cannot now be undertaken^end the same oondititiona must eontinue^to weaken tho country's orediVend plague^tbe lines of busines, unices means are de^^vised for removing t lie so iasuee from tbe^channel of current redemption jmmI such^timo as tbe government finds Itself in e^position to do that which at Orel was tbe^intent of all^gradually redeem sad ean-^oel them. Tbe ultimate redemption of^coin muat of course all be upon the gov^^ernment, but the embarrassment does not^arias from their ultimate, but from their^current redemption. Itis therefore, suggested that It con^^gress shall repeal the provisions of the^present act requiring national beaks to^make a deposit of government bonds^iu order to secure circulating notes, and^substitute therefor a provision giving^hem instead the right to issue the .earns^against their assets, it incorporate there-^is, and as a part thereof, that, aa a pre^^requisite to so doing, the banks be com^^pelled to deposit with the treasurer of the^United States legal tender leeues, or^issues under tho act of 1890, equal in^amount to the differenee between the^percentage of tbeir capital etook ef the^lesue granted against their assete sad tbe^total of sucb capital stock. Thedeposits thus made ought to re^^main with the treasurer until tbe bank^ceased eitbor through voluntary or invol^^untary liquidation, to do business) end in^that case the government ought to redeem^and cancel such treasury iasuee deposi^^ted. As againat tiiia deposit of legal ten^^der and treasury notes so made there^should be issued to the hanks, dollar for^dollar, national bank uotee, either ef the^same or different design, aa might be^deemed beet. Thegovernment should not undertake^or in any wise become responsible for tbe^current redemption of tbeee notes. Its^responsibility should end with the re^^demption of tbe notes deposited to secure^sueb circulation when tbe bsnk ceasei to^exist. At tbe present a current redemp^^tion fund of 5 per cent, of the outstand^^ing circulation is found sufficient and it ia^probable that in future no greater amount^would be required. Tbe elasticity- ef^lesue in tbe national bank circulation will^be found in tbe percentage ef tbe issue^against the aeaete subjeet to the necessary^rate of taxations and insured by an ade^^quate sefety fund to guarantee tbe note^holders against lose. Tbe government^will be aided, tbe bank given in exebenge^dollar for dollar deposited, and thus be^relieved of the lose incident to depositing^an amount ef ite capital stock In excess^of tbe return la notes granted it. No^violent contraction of tbe eurreney would^follow sueb a course, but whenever a con^^traction did occur it would be not lose^gradual than at other times. Suggestionsnave been received from^many eminent sources that tbs whole^question of tbe banking snd eurreney^eystem ought to be referred by congress^to a committee to be created by lav, ap^^pointed by the president, and clothed by^proper authority. Thiscommission, nonpartisan in its^character, composed of men of eminent^abilities, could unqestionably deviee a^currency system, sound in every part, and^one wbieh would commend itself to every^interest of the country. It could largely^take the question out of politics and have^it considered simply in iu business as^^pects and upon ite merits; but if the pres^^ent congress is to enact a lav upon the^subject, the appointment of tbe commis^^sion would avail nothing. If. however,^nothing more definite can be accom^^plished, tbe queetion of tbe creation of^eucb a commission ought to be considered^and acted upon.^

He says^that American enterprise is a century^ahead of tbe law, for the Americans own^more steamships,forbidden by tho registry^lew to wear the American colors, than^they own steamships in foreign trade un^^der tbe stars and stripes, and the Admis^^sion of such vessels to American registry^la desirable to advance our maretime^rank. In30 years only one American steam^^ship baa once visited Hamburg, the great-^eat continental port, and last year only^two sailing vessels entered there. Every^bushel of grain which left New York for^Europe lest year waa carried under a for^^eign Has. Of 11,000 vessels passing the^Hues easel In the last six years only six^have been American.

Wabhinoton,Dec. 3 ^ The senate will^be called to order Monday at 13 o'clock,^noon, when the last session of ^be 58J^congress will begin. The vice president^is in Ibis city and will preside Tbe ses^^sion will begin with a full calendar, tbe^result of committee action during the^long session, and it collects at leaat 300^Items, covering e wide range of matters. Muchinterest is felt etnung tbe sena^^tors of oil political beliefs in the presi^^dent's message and In its recommenda^^tions. It is necessary to discuss them^further before deciding upon a plan of ac^^tion. Tbe democratic majority of tbe^finance committee is on record in favor of^tbe passing of tbe bills and it is not im^^probable early action of the committee ia^sought to frustrate any attempt to pre-^treat legislation. These will have mush^teds la directing tbe course of tbe senate.^If there are recommendations for radical^departures on financial methods they are^sure to lead to much speebmaking early^in tbe session end later to form a basis of^eommlttee action. Significanceia also attached to Senator^Yoorbees' declaration that be will esk tbe^^anoe committee to sit on Tuesday.^Tuesday Is the day for the regular meet-^lag ef tbie committee but it doee not or^^dinarily meet ee promptly after the assem^^bling of tbe eenato. t bairman Voorhees^declines to Slate the object of tbe meet^^ing farther then to say It is held for tbe^purpose of permitting en exchange of^views among the members. If tbe presi^^dent's message is received Monday the^executive recommends! ions could, ef^course, be tsken up, but ss there baa been^no positive assurance as to when tbe mes^^sage would come in, when tbe meeting^waa decided on, it would appear tbe chair^^man bad other objects in view. It is pos^^sible hie purpose may be to arrange a^policy anon the supplemental tariff bills.^Tbeee bdle have ell been reported by tbe^committee, but it msy be considered^necessary to discuss thsm further^before deciding upon a plan of^action. Tbe democratic majority ef^the finance committee is on record In^favor of the passage of the bills and It is^not improbable that tbe early aotlon of^the committee Is sought to frustrate any^attempt to prevent legislation. Thia is not^altogether a surmise for it is known seme^ef the so-called conservative senators^have advised that a general party confer^^ence be held after the senateconvencs for^the consideration of this question. Tbe^experience of tbe last session showed^whenever caucusee were held tbe con^^servatives carried their points. Hence^there is reason for the prompt action of^the friends of the supplementary bills. Thereappears to lie nothing outside of^financial or tariff questions likely to ex^^cite a rippls during the woek. After tbe^receipt of tho president's message and^when it gets down to business tho sonate^may take up the calendar iu regular or^^der, or it may proceed to consider out of^order, some of the more important bills^which have been reported, such as those^for tbe admission of Am nu and New^Mexico, or tho bankruptcy, auti-option^and Nicaragua bills. Iu any event the^deily sessious of the week will b ^ short^with tbe probabilities strongly in favor of^adjournment from Thursday to Monday^the week following. thereAre Evidence- of It la the Civil^Service.

Aboutone-half of nil the employee ef^the clans fled service are in 610 classified^postofllres. Tbe law. It is said, Is now^better observed in the larger offices than^ever before.

Politics^Is said to have been practically eliminated^in making the apiwintments and remov^^als ia almost all large posiofBcea, aa well^as most branches of the departmental^eervice at Washington. There beve been^complaints from many sm tiler offices^snowing a barge number of removals made^for political reasons, although other of^^fenses, generally of a minor character, are^ullcged aa the ground of dismissal.

Aaia customary in such cases, this dis^^patch was promptly communicated to tbe^navy department and the marines were^orded to be transferred from the other^vessels of the American* fleet to the^Monocacy at Fien Tain, near Pekln. In^addition Admiral Carpenter was instruc^^ted to put himself In communication with^Minister Denby, and to use his discretion^in doing everything necessary to ensure^the safely of the American residents. All of^this took place some time ago and since^then Mr. Denby has made no further ap^^plication for protection. He is at liberty^at any time to transfer bis legation to^Tien Tsln. where It would be almost uuder^tbe guns of tbe Monscaey, and in fact he^waa authorised to do this at a very early^stage In tbe war when tbe Chinese showed^symptoms of disaffection at the first re^^verses sustained by their armies. Thelegation would certainly bo much^safer at Tien Tsln than at Pekin as It Is^impossible for even tbe light draft Mon-^eeacy to navigate tbe river up to tbe latter^city at this season of the year. Butthe fact that Mr. Denhy, although^the means of communication are open,^has not recently asked for aid from the^department le regarded as evidence that^he feele no apprehension at present, end^this view is supported by tbe cable advices^from Chee Foo to the offset that, encour^^aged by tbe prospect of a restoration of^peace, many foreign residents at Pskin,^wbo bad taken refuge st Tien Tela, were^returning to Pekin.
