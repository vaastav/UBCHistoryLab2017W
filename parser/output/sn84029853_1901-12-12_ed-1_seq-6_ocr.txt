10 flllSWERGHRHlSHMlIS. Banks Must Tell The Exact State Of Deposits. JUDGES HAD SIMILAR CASES. Topeka, lec. lO. The supreme court has handed down a decision of interest to bankers. The decision was render ed in the ease of the Eock Island Lum ber Company against the Fourth National bank of "Wichita. The com pany garnisheed the bank for a claim which a man named Joselyn owed it. The bank replied that Joselyn had no money on deposit. It was proven later that he did have, but that it was de posited in, the name of .Toselyn as president of the police board. The president of the police board had no right to the possession of police funds, and the lumber company contended that it was simply a way he had of eluding- it: that the money really be longed to him and was subject to (famishment. Banks, as a rale, deny liability in order to protect their de positors. In this case the supreme court took special occasion to lay down a new rule for banks to follow. It is that, when a garnishment is run, the bank must make a full reply showing what the depositor has on deposit, whether it is deposited in his name or as t-rustee. In fact, the bank must tell under oatli the exact status of the de posit. The lent-th to which the court went in this decision is due to some experi ence the judges themselves had in litigation of that kind when thev were practicing- law. It developed in the discussion of the case that nearly all of the judges at some time or other had had trouble in finding out from the banks the status of the accounts of litigants, and in order to stop such practice the court went a step further than it really was called upon to do. Justice Pollock wrote the opinion. A Kshsi City Nt. Chicago, Dec. !.

President Carnot, Prime Minister Canovas, the Empress of Austria, King- Humbert and President McKjnley having been foully assassinated bv Anarchists within the last seven years.

He argued that international comity called for action on our part to suppress the origin of plots In this country ag-ainst foreign rulers. , Mr. MeComas was accorded close attention throughout his remarks., Senator Hoar (Mass.) said the great difficulty in all these cases of assassina tion was that the assassin was willing and anxious to give up his life. Fear of consequences did not in any. way deter such an assassin. Every assassin of a foreign ruler had expected early and certain death. The Senator "be lieved that - a much more effective remedy could be secured if by common consent of all civilized nations some tract of land somewhere on the earth's surface, hemmed in from the outer world, could be set aside for the con finement of those who counseled the killing of rulers or the overthrow of govern men ts.
