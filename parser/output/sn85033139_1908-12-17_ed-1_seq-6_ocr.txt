Construing the de cision of the i "iirt in a dissenting opin ion. Justice Day expressed the opinion that tin- construction given the inter state commerce law takes from It all power of investigation. Cross Appeals Filed. The case came to the supreme court on cross appeals by Harriman and the government from a decision of the circuit c.uirt of the Dulled States for the south ern district of New A ork, holding that Mr. Harriman should be compelled to make response to most of the quest ions.

When Mr. Harriman was put on the stand, he ilcelined, in response to a ques ion, to say whether he had owned any of the Chicago A Alton stock which was purchased hy the Inion pacific and the price of whieli had been fixed by him self; wild her a portion of the stock ol the Illinois Central had been acquired by a pool of which he was a member with the view to selling it to the Union Dacibe; atnl whether the Inion Pacific lireciors wire interested in tint New A ork Central stock which was acquired by the Inion Pacitie. He also declined to state bow much of the stock of the .Atchison, Topeka A Saute Fe was owned by director of the Inion I ’aeitie. Answer Order by Appeal. The circuit court directed Mr. Harri man to reply to these questions, and be responded by appealing to the supreme court. The appeal "1 the government from the decision of the court was based upon the refusal of the lower court to compel Mr. Hurriman to answer a ques tion as to whether he hud purchased slock in the Union Pacific in aulieipa lion of an increased dividend.

FORAKER WANTS NEGROES’ CASE OPENED AGAIN ASKS SENATE TO PROVIDE TRIB UNAL TO HEAR DISCHARGED TROOPER’S TESTIMONY. TAS NEW EVIDENCE TO OFFER. Declares Detectives, “Not Secret Service Men,” Have Been Meddling with Brownsville Soldiers. AMENDS BILL FOR RE-ENLISTMENT. WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 14.- Senntnr Ft raker today introduced an amendment to the bill providing for the rc-cnlistment of the negro troops dis ■linrged without honor because of al leged participation in the affray at Brownsville, Tex., and addressed the Senate concerning the amendment. He proposes in his new measure to estab lish a tribunal consisting of retired army officers, naming these officers in (he bill, before w hom evidence may he submit- j led as to the guilt of defendant- and he- j lore whom the defendants themselves might appear to answer to charges. The measure is so drawn as practically to . lak ■ out of the hands of the c\ ■cutive and give to a tribunal appointed by Con gress full authority to consider the Brownsville question and by its findings provide for the rc-cnlistmeat ol the dis charged negroes. New Investigation Necessary. In addressing the Senate Air. Foraker mid it was an elementary proposition in American law that the accused may | have an opportunity to confront the ac- i ■user and to appear in person and an- j tnver with evidence. He said that he 1 md not expected it would he necessary ! (i enter upon anew investigation of the Brownsville question, hut that during 1 he summer letters had hcea coming to aim from these discharged negro sol liers declaring that detectives were con stantly engaging them in conversation. ‘These men.” said Senator Foraker, ’are not secret service detectives of curse, for they would have no right under (he law to engage i.i such service.” j President’s Message Read. “Dpon the conclusion of Mr. Forakcr’s remarks, Mr. Culberson asked that the President's message on the Brownsville I iff air be read and Vice President Fatr lanks directed that that be done, till the senators present remaining in their | -eats find listening attentively to the reading. After the reading of the President's message, which was brief, had been con cluded, the clerk read all of the state- , incuts and other evidence' submitted to i :he war department for which the I‘resi- { hail's message was merely a letter of transmittal. This is contrary to the tsital custom. Ordinarily the general rep uts are -■ nt to tic- propt r e mimic | tee without the formality of reading. In view of the fact that the report con tains what purports to he a partial con fession of guilt by one if the discharged negro soldiers much interest was shown in the reading.
