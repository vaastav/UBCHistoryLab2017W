F. I. ADDIS~ON ....... Publisher. PUBLISHED EVERY SATURDAY. SATURDAY, DECEMB1ER 9., 1899. Mark Hanna has not been heard from since the election. Evidently he lina taken those Cuyahoga 'county returns very much to heart. The I. & V. and Southern Pacific will have tickets on sale December 20, 21 and 22d to all points at one fare for the round trip, good for re turn 30 days from date. The burning of Crowley College last Friday iht is a severe blow to that town, as the institution was well patronized and helped in promoting the advantages of the place. The cane farmers who are selling to outside refineries have finished deliv ering and are now enjoying the fruits ,of their labor. Although the crop was short this year the season has been unusually fine. Mr. Bailey, of Texas, has declared that Mr. Bankhead is his choice for minority leader of the House of Rep resentatives. Mr. Bailey has been there himself and ought to know the kind of man needed to tackle the rampant majority. Senator Daniel has been advanced o4 Presidential proportions through the efforts of an energetic and able Richmond journal. The party might go farther and fare worse, but indi cations now point to the renomina tion and the election of Mr. Bryan. After wobbling on the cunency question for years, it is at last an nounced that McKinley has sufficient ly stiffened his dorsal vertebrae to urge that some step be taken toward enacting a gold standard. It would be well for\the majority to hurry up, as he may change his mind. No less a competent legal authority than a former Republican Senator of the United States, Hon. George F. BlE unds, of Vermont, declares that Re.sentative-elect ' Roberts sla d be protected in his constitutioa~1 rights, and if elected prorly, b m~orn in as a member of the House. Former Senator Call of Florida de clares that his defeat was brought about by the money of the Standard Oil Company. Trusts in Florida, he says, are fourishing finely. Why not name Mark Hansa as a committee of one to become acquainted with this latest form of Republican monopoly fostering. Ml c Lean is prominently Swntione k[r. Bryan's running nma. anit year. Mr. McLean's ex perience in the recent Ohio campaign has probably furnished him ow0t4nome large siaod ideas relative to the prae tical aid. d politics, and he would make a competent colleague for the silver advocate. Elihu Root for Vice-President seems to be the choice of the New York State publican boss, Tom Platt. Mr. ot, however, should be very wary. It would be well for him to keep in mind the fate that overtook Morton in 1896. Tom is a very sleek trickster. Woodruff is a man after his own heart and would have the nominatiod-if the wily Tom dared to urge him for the place. The President's essage. President McKinley sent his annual message to Congress whieh was read Tuesday in both Houses. After making a brief reference to the death of the Vice President, congratulates the Congress on the prosperous con dition of the country and the excel lent status of government funds and the retirement of bonds; calls atten tion to the growing scarcity of money and urges increased issue through national banks; urges redemption of greenbacks in gold and their retire ment; encouragement of merchant marine, presumaily by subsidy; calls attention to the trust evil, and hopes for relief through uniform State laws, supplemented by Federal enactments; says foreign relations are satisfactory; calls attention to the importance of an isthmian canal, and invites the at tention of Congress anew to the pro ject; recommends commission to, study Chinese trade; urges securing of more space at the Paris Exposi tion; devotes special mention to cor dial relations with Germany; relates progress of negotiation of disputes with Canada; has "avoided alliances not of direct concern" in South Afri ca; discusses at length the Tallulah lynchings, and says the contingency has arisen for giving Federal courts jurisdiction in such cases; recom menis laying of cable to Manila; re cites the partition of the Samoan I. lands. Concerning Cuba, the Prei dent is eloquent but vague, saying pledges of self-government must kept, but not mentioning indepen ence, but, on the contrary, asserti'v "the destinies of Cuba are * * £rrevocal4 linked with our own, 1t how and how far is for the future determine;" the American mini has been instructed to press for early settlement of claims against Turkey; the maintenance of the fu reau of American Republics for ten mere years is regarded with gratiflBs tion, and the Pan-American Exposi tion, he hopes, will tend more firmly to cement the friendship of nations on this continent; congratulates tij country on the outcome of The H conference and the volunteers on prompt enlistment and services a tBe late wat; felicitates the navy tthe fact that it has maintain e gal lantry that characterized i brilli at past, and urges necess~ ovison by Congress for armo e ll uphold American sov gntyin tie Philippines until Co pro -vernment for t ads, ap rges ,_ no step a be isken.;i iesprgmpt eniit:at of laws for tl goverament.of ~ Iaraii and Als ka,apnd for temp9rary ibrm of gov w~rment for Puerto Rico; delionuces Iehing as intolerable in a. civilized country,. The message concludes with reooihmendations as to'civil eer vice nad good government of "he District'of Columbia. Congressman Crumpacker's seir bill to cia down the vote'f the'Soath in the electoral college because large numbers of negroes are denied the right of suffrage in certain States is causing considerable comment. In noticing the matter the New ,Orleans Telegram very appropriately remarks: "One of the New England States has a property qualification for suffrage, but there has never been any suggesr tion of depriving , of rongressional representation an the sout. The theory is that non .- o s holders la that State have a right to .eps o in i Congress, even if they have no voice '/. le ion. his t eory is moreaP to oo tion in Misssi while not capab - 1 ligent vote, a in ests must be y la makers, State and national." Before Aguinaldo rebelled against us and ae, he was fighting Spain, he was a patriot in the eyes of th Administnration. Now he is a t ngan ' . It the clamor of the Republieans against the yating of Roberts were based upon the sincere conviction that he was an improper representa tive, 'it is safe to assume that the great body of thinking Democrats the country over would join heartily in th4 movement to deprive him of the ri.t to participate in the deliber ations'of the House. But the politi cal ph se of the question is so appa rent i1d 'the obvious advantage to accru to the Republicans through the b *ring of the House's door to a Mormoi so prominent, that the phar isaical professions of the majority Sdece've no one. All that'is ask ed for Roberts is justice, and the min will see that this is accorded him. I 'h4htrusts are an issue that the Re publi..;is do not care to have brought pomi'.ently to the front in the next yeer'sicampaign. To show the ex et1'ý't4 a hich these monopolies crea ted to enrich the stockholders at the espenb of the people at large, have .~en nourished under that great hum bug, the Protective tariff, should be th~ aini of every Democratic editor ssa speaker in next year's struggle. Mark Hunna to the contrary notwith standi , there are trusts and very big ton: at that. Mr. IBiran's marvelous work in Nebraska caused that State to remain in t P, .erocratic column. Now that the a. ipt der is about to visit the East] $here is a small sized panic among members of the G. O. P., and well ttley may be frightened. The ersonal magnetism of the man and undisputed sincerity have won dusaý-dq of votes for him in the May it not be possible that tbhsarIe elements of popularity will d91 agwell for him in the East? 4tr royly inclined President has b e so sensitive relative to his do ings that any *riticism on the part of a dloor government clerk brings down pe Administration wrath to the point f dismissal. Noble E. Dawson, a blerk in the War Department, has been removed for criticising the President. Evidently free speech is restrioted not only in Russia and in China, but in the United States as well. That is an unseemly controversy which hau c:'oen between the Navy and War Department relative to the removal of the wreck of the Maine from the harbor of Havana. It would sel that so long as it is known that raave sailors of the Maine are ly Iu"~ the bottom of that foul harbor, department friction for the time be ing, coald be subordinated to practi , patntism.
