New Tork, Pec. IB The World In tho course of Its answer to President Roosevelt's reference to that paper In his special message, to congress today, says: "Mr. Roosevelt Is mistaken. He can not muzzle .tue World. ' "While no amount of Billingsgate on his parr can alter our determination to treat him wltn Judicial Impartiality and scrupulous fairness, wo repeat what, we have Already said, that the congress of of the I 'nltcd States should make a thorough investigation of the whole Panama transaction, that the full truth j may be known to the American people. "The World fully appreciates the j compliment paid to It by Mr. Roose- j -pt in making It the subject of a spe-1 clal mesaag to the congress of the United States. "The World likewise appreciates the; Importance and significance of Mr. Roosevelt's statement when he declares to congress that the proprietor of the World should be prosecuted for libel by the governmental authorities, and that 'the attorney general has under con sideration the form tinder which the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought.' "This Is fh first time a President ever asserted the doctrine of lesr im- Jesh- or proposed. In thn absence of ' ' " , , , . .; , ! ernmenr or Tile conouei fo muni'UMn ivho may have hnd business dealings with the government. Neither the king peror would venture to nrrostate such power to himself. John Adams' attempt to enforce the sedition law destroyed tbp federalist party In America. Yet Mr Roosevelt In the absence of lew of. ficlslly proposes to use all the power of the greatest government on earth to: rrlppl" the freedom nf the pre.ss on the j pretpvt that the government llself has i been libelled and he Is the government. ! "Tit I.i true that the World printed Ihe ' puilic reports concerning the Panama ! raJna! efffilr which resulted from Wll-l lifym Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the d'f-trlct attorney's office during the re-i ,(-ent csmpijlgn to prevent Ihe publics "tlon of n story which wn said to be In the bands of the Hemo.-ratle national mmmltt'o. P was Mr. Cromwell s own P'-tlon which raised the Issue In the campaign. "It is true alo that when Mr. Roose velt, made his attack on Oelavan Pmlth tbe -yi-nrl.l called attention to certain statements which Mr Roosevelt must have known to be false nr misleading, and appealed to congress to end all pcandal by a full and Impartial Investi gation.

Taft or Douglas Robinson made nnv profits whatever. Mr. Tafi denied that bo was concerned In Hi" transaction In any w-ay, which denial the World published nnd accepted, II would bsve been equally glad to print Mr. Robinson's Menial could It have succeeded In obtaining one from him, as tt frequently attempted. The "World ban no evidence that lie va.i gnroelated with Mr. Cromwell, and would accept Ills wind to that effect; for Mr. Robinson Is an estimable gen tleman of high character whose repu tation for veracity Is Infinitely better than that, of his distinguished brother-in-law. "If the World has libelled nnyhody we hope It will be punished, hut we do not Intend to he Intimidated by Mr. Roosevelt's threats, or by Mr, Roosevelt's denunciation, or by Mr. Roosevelt's power. "No other living man ever so gross ly libelled the United States as does this president who besmirches con press, bulldozes judges, assails the In tegrity of courts, slanders private citi zens, and who has shown hlmsulf the most reckless, unscrupulous demag ogue whom the American people ever trusted with great, power and author ity. "We say this not In anger but In sincere sorrow, Tim World has Im measurably morn respect for the otlleo of president of 1 1 us United States than Theodore Hotmevclt has ever Bhown diiriig tho years In which ho has maintained a reign of terror and vlll llcd the honor and honesty of both public otticUls and private cUUmis who opposed his policies or thwarted him In his purposes. "So far ss the World Im concerned Us proprietor may go lo Jail, If Mr. Roosevelt succeeds, as h" I h rca I i ii.i ; but e 'en in Jail the World will put cease Id ho a fearless rhn m pii'ii of free speech, a frpo press and a free people." , Joseph Pulitzer, propvlot of th" World, to niKlit sold: "So far ns I am personally concerned, I was al spa during the whole of Octo ber, and, In furl, practically for two years 1 have been yachting "n account or my health. I never road a word or syllable of this Pa.uuma story, was not In connection with Hi" paper, nnd lm'1 nothing to do with It. Mr. Roosevelt knows all tlilR perfectly. He known 1 am a chronic Invalid and mostly abroad yachting on account of my Health. I think his anger Is simply due to the, sharp atlnoka innde by the World on him polltlcnlly. For that perhaps 1 am responsible; that Is, for .tho general political criticism of Mr. Roosevelt on puhHfl and political grounds solPly. I Bin rpally sorry he should be so very nngry, but the World will continue, to criticise him without a shadow of fear, If ha should succeed In compelling me, to edit tho paper from Jail." The. foregoing was called forth by a special message to congress yesterday llT'V1,0 rT"o ?.! .,"'KP'1 v!r; cutlon of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the.
