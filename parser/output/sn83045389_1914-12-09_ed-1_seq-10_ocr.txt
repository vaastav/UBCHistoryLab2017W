WALL STREET IS BUSY PREPARING ITS FORCES Broker* Getting Ready to Resume Business After Many Weeks of Idleness. SPECULATION IS ENCOURAGED Free Trading Will Re Permitted in All Stocks Selling at 915 or Under. Restricted Dealing in Semispccu lativc Issues. _ ! IJY BROADAN M ALI NEW' YOHK. Dfifmbor Wall Street n^nt a busy day connecting up telephones, rearranging clerical forces anil making other necessary preparations for the resumption ; of speculative activity on Saturday. Stock Exchange officials have arranged ] encourage speculation by permitting free tiding In the stocks that are selling: at I W'J or under, und perinlttlnK restricted trad- | lng In the semlspeculallve Issues and debar- 1 ring many of the high grade Investment stock*. such as Union Pacific. Canadian Pu- | olfic. Great Northern, pfd.. and Illinois Central. . Brokers are merchants, and their profits depend upon the rapid turnover of other people's holdings. For nineteen weeks they have practically been without means of J livelihood, and their capital In somo cases i has been endangered In financing the com- | niitments of their clients. They are. there- | fore, unusually keen to resume business and l encourage trading In stocks, for the bond j business !s but a small portion of the day's : work for the members of the Stock Ex- | change. Commissions on stock and specula- I tlve operations provide the bread and butter of the commission houses. Bonds were quiet to-day. Rock Island is- | sues were active and strong on buying, at- J trlbut"d to the copper Interests, which con- i trol tne property. The recent advance In i these securities will, it Is believed, bo fol- j lowed by an active speculation In the shares i of the Hock Island Company. A lively do- i mnnd was noted to-day. the common oliang- | ing hands at 1*4 and the preferreil was strongly bid at 2. KOC'K ISLAND WIL.I. St'KVIV E ITS PUNISHMENT Speaking of the Rock Island property, the head of a commission house, who lias had a practical experience In railroading, said: "I believe the Rock Island is- one of tho ' best located roads In the country. It wjll survive Its punishment. I lived In tho West for many years, and was prominently active In railroad management. Union Pacific, and Northern Pacific survived under clrcum stnnces In which the country could not so rapidly recuperate, and I further believe wo have passed the low period of this depres sion. It is easily conceivable 'that Rock Island stocks at current prices will prove an attractive speculative proposition." In the outside market notes were firm at the best prices yet established. Trading was quieter, with a disposition to watch the effect of renewal of stock market op erations. Copper exports from New York for the week ending November H were 12,400,000 pounds, the custom-house reported. It is believed In the trade that the business ex ceeded these figures. Heavy buying orders have been In the hands of exporters, al though every effort Is being made to hide this business. The activity of foreign agents in soliciting offers points to a continua tion of heavy shipments. Domestic man ufacturers are known to have taken on large amounts of the metal below 12 cents and. as many of the big producers have sold their production for months ahead, higher prices are anticipated. The administration evidently Is not going to kick the prostrato form of business." was Wall Street'^ Interpretation of President Wilson's message. NEW 

YORK. December S.?Sentiment In financial circles was heartened to-day by the decision of the Stock Exchange to re sume restricted trading in slocks on Sat urday. This feeling was accentuated by tho firmer tendency shown by nearly nil classes of securities. The day's list of stocks sub mitted for publication showed several ad ditions to that Issued yesterday, indicating steady extension of tho demand. While no apprehension was entertained re specting the wisdom of the move made by the exchange, it may be said that every pre caution to Inspire this success will bo taken. The fact that It has not been deemed nec essary to form n money pool to he used as a backstop against heavy liquidation was regarded as an Indication that offerings would find ready absorption. Another safe guard will be found in the level of prices at which all stocks over $11 may bo sold. Further demand for exchange on Berlin was the solid feature of the market for for eign remittance, cables to that-centro being quoted at, 92<>t. with sight drafts at 92. Private advices from Washington suggest ed un early decision by tho lnterstnte Com merce Commission In the Eastern freight rate caie. ? Continued ease mark? the local money situation, call and time loans being made lit the prevailing low rates. Interior hanks bought -nore freely of mercantile paper, these acceptances coinciding with encourag ing trade advices. Unofficial news respecting the steel indus try suggested a better inquiry for special products, with a continuance of the dead lock for equipment materials. November tonnage of the United Stales Steel Corpora tion. to be published on Thursday, was ex pected to disclose another decrease In un filled orders. NEW YORK.

The opening was steady at unchanged prices to an ad vnnci of t\? o points, and at first sight the census report Indicating 13.006.100 bales ginned to December 1. or the largest amount on record, appeared to Inspire some scattered selling. The market eased off three or four points right after the call under small local offerings, with active positions selling two or three points below last night's closing ?Igures. Prices soon steadied, however, sell 'ng some three to four points net hlglior luring the afternoon on covering and a Ittle trade buying.
