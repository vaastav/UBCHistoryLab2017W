THE RED STORM Or the Days of Daniel Boone - —— By JOEL ROBINSON CHAPTER 111. Allan Norwood, with a few hardy ad venturers, had floated down the Ohio and Kentucky in boats and reached, af ter encountering innumerable perils, the vicinity of the new settlements. Leav ing his comrades to refresh themselves after nights and days of toil and danger, our hero took his rifle and sallied forth to explore the country a little and learn how near they might bo to Boonesbor ough and Harrodsburg, when he acci dentally became a party to the scene between Rosalthe Alston and Le Bland, Allan was the son of a wealthy farm er and received a very liberal education. Naturally bold and adventurous, he felt a strong repugnance to any of the learn ed professions. He longed for a life of activity. Accounts were daily reaching Ohio, through various channels, of the sufferings and romantic adventures of Daniel Boone, Benjamin Logan, John Harrod and other pioneers; and those re markabte stories made Allan conceive ■he bold design of penetrating to that wild region, to share in the excitement nnd danger of a backwoodsman’s life. This resolution being formed and a plan of operation matured, the requisite material, in the shape of enterprising young men, was speedily fou'-d to co operate with him, and the perilc under taking was achieved. As Allan walked toward Boonesbor ough with its daring founder he could not refrain from observing him with deep interest; and he truly appeared to him the most remarkable man of the age; for he had explored alone the mighty for ests of Kentucky, braving singly the fury ot the exasperated savages, who follow ed his footsteps day and night to de stroy him and prevent him from carry ing back to his countrymen the history of the most delightful country under heaven. But thus far he had escaped the deadly hostility of the wily sav age. and the man of sleepless nights and weary days, ordained by God to carry life and civilization into the distant wil derness, now stood beside our hero with firm foot and lofty brow. When they reached Boonesborough Norwood paused to examine the manner in which it was constructed. It con sisted of a dozen cabins built of heavy logs, ingeniously interlaced at the ends, and separated from each other by por tions of the same material. These cab ins formed one side of the fort, being highest on the outside, the roofs inclin ing inward. Strong stockades were rais ed around these at suitable distance, and in the angles of the cabins block houses of the most substantial kind were erected. These projected about twenty inches beyond the outer walls of thn cabins and stockades, and were amply provided with loopholes. Allan, after making these observations, remarked “that the whole must have been the work of considerable labor.” “You are right, young man, and it was not only a work of much labor, but a work often interrupted by sudden at tacks of the savages. It reminded me of Nhemiah repairing the walls of Jeru salem, when his workmen wrought with one hand and held the spear with the other,” replied the pioneer; and then led the way to a large gate of slabs, upon which he struck a few blows with the butt of his rifle. Directly footsteps were heard and a voice asked: “Who dar?” “It is one of our colored fellows,” re marked Boone to Allan, and then re plied to the negro’s reasonable inquiry: “It is me, Andrew.” “I doesn’t know any sich white fel ler. was the immediate response. “Come, don’t keep us waiting; hurry,” rejoined Boone. “Dat you, Massa Bnone?” asked An drew, in more respeettu. tone. The forester replied that It was; the negro opened the door, and the parties entered the inclosure. Allan glancd at Andrew while he was closing the gate, and perceived that he was considerably advanced in life, his woolly hair being gray with age, though his figure was not bowed by the weight of years.' “A faithful, but rather eccentric fel low is Andrew,” observed Captain Boone. He then lifted the rude latch and ushered the young hunter into his cabin. A respectable looking female met him on the threshold, whom he intro duced to Allan ns Mrs. Boone. A young woman of eighteen or twenty he pre sented as his daughter Elizabeth. Nor wood had entertained a hope that the maiden whom he had seen in the morn ing might prove to be the daughter of the famous pioneer, but when his gaze rested upon Elizabeth Boone, although she was fair, he could not so far master his feelings as to realize no disappoint ment at the discovery. A lad of about fifteen years of age was cleaning the tube of a rifle, and was the forester’s son. Captain Boone informed his family that his guest, who was from the State of Ohio, had come to examine the coun try. and hoped he would receive such hospitality as their poor dwelling cou’d afford; to which Mrs. Boone respond! in an appropriate and kindly manner, and set about making preparations for dinner. While the meal was being prepared, Allan proceeded to relate the particu lars of the morning’s adventure, to which his host listened with earnest attention. “Did you hear any portion of the con versation that passed between the young woman and the Frenchman?” he asked. "I am quite certain that I heard the latter refer to some danger of an immi nent and pressing kind that menaced this settlement, or the neighboring one.” “And you say. moreover, that he wish ed to extort a promise of some kind from her?” continued Boone. “It was that which caused me to in terfere in her behalf; and the promise of secrecy I doubt not had reference to the danger which threatens you,” re joined Allan. “This matter may be of the greatest importance to us, Mr. Norwood. Were there any names mentioned, that you can .remember?” resumed the forester. “Yes. a name was mentioned which 1 now recollect. Du Quesne, 1 think it ,was.” Daniel Boone sprang from his seat (With a sudden and angry impulse. “Du Quesne, did you say, sir?” he Exclaimed. “Then there is indeed dan ger. for he is an instrument to do us harm. The Indians will rally around him to crush us. I have beard his name; he acts under the authority of the Brit ish posts, and has been active in dis tributing arms and ammunition among the savage tribes.” “Allow me to inquire who this Le Bland is who came so near sending a bullet through my body?” rejoined Allan. “That question is not easily answered, Joung man. I need information on the subject myself. He came among ns about four weeks ago. He has man aged to make himself peculiarly agree able to Esquire Alston, and that he loves his handsome daughter Rosalthe is no secret among us. The girl fears him. What the secret of his influence is, I have not been able to discover.” “Does Mr. Alston favor the preten sions of the Frenchman?” asked Allan, earnestly. “Most decidedly. Esquire Alston was formerly a man of wealth, and could indulge in the luxuries of refined life. He also has indubitable claims to a no ble ancestry. He married iuto a distin guished family, and his daughter receiv ed an education far superior to that which usually falls to the lot of young ladies. Having lost most of his wealth by an unfortunate investment, he turned his attention to this new country, and had the courage to dare a pioneer’s life, but if Squire Alston has any weak point, it is that his sweet daughter should mar ry a gentleman.” The conversation was interrupted at that moment by the entrance of Simon Kenton, a man whose name is honorably mentioned In the annals of Kentucky history. His face had a frank and hon est expression which served ns a pass port to the good opinion of Allan. The brief ceremony of introduction had scarcely been finished before another in dividual made his appearance in the cabin of the pioneer. This was Joel Logston, a man of extraordinary mus cular power, and of whose wonderful ex ploits tradition is yet eloquent. He was followed by one of the largest and ugli est dogs that ever aspired to the friend ship of a human being. On account of the explosive and fiery nature of his disposition his master had bestowed upon him the name of Vesu vius. Vesuvius was a snappish and fret ful cur, given to sudden, violent and dan gerous eruptions of the lava of wrath, when it became imperatively necessary for all within a certain area to with draw themselves speedily to escape in stant worriment with tooth and nail. This ungentle mastiff always walked about six inches behind Joel Logston, except when engaged in his favorite pur suit of hunting, for on these occasions he was invariably in advance of every thing in the shape of quadruped or bi ped. Joel Logston was quite as celebrated for his marvelous narrations and extrav agant style as for his physical strength. No man of the three settlements could tell with such incomparable self-posses sion and coolness such stories as he did. With this strong proclivity to exaggera tion was combined a rough drollery and good nature that made him at all times a very agreeable companion. If Joel had any malice in his heart it manifested it self in putting Andrew in mortal fear by causing Vesuvius to show his teeth and make several hostile demonstrations toward him. Nor was Andrew the only subject of these currish persecutions. Mr. Alston’s colored man, Exquisite Eb ony, was another martyr to Joel and his mastiff. While Allan was partaking of the substantial hospitality of the pioneer in the form of excellent venison and other wholesome and palatable viands, Log ston. amused all the parties by relating one of his recent adventures, in which he assorted, with much modesty of man ner. that he had no doubt slain four teen Indians with his own hand, besides doing to death a litter of bears of six months, with their sire and dam. For the truth of this reasonable statement he appealed to Vesuvius, who answered with a short, sharp and expressive yelp, and then fixed his fiery eyes upon An drew in such a threatening manner that the latter retreated to the farthest cor ner of the room, rolling his eyes in great alarm. Simon Kenton, though a braver man in the hour of danger never held a rifle, sat silent and reserved as a young maid en; but Allan observed that his eyes sought the neat figure of Lizzie Boone, as she moved lightly about the dwelling. CHAPTER IV. Rosalthe returned to the fort much perplexed and agitated by the singular conduct of Le Bland. Notwithstanding the high place which he occupied in the estimation of her father, she had never valued him as an acquaintance; on the contrary, she had never felt at ease in his society, Ihe cause of her aversion to the insinuating Frenchman, she could not herself understand fully; but it was not the less genuine for that reason. Encouraged by her father's good opin ion. he had made declarations at various times of the nature and tendency of which she could not affect to misappre hend. Rosalthe, on all such occasions, had given no word of hope, and with a careful regard to his feelings endeavor ed to make known her sentiments with out wounding his pride. ”1 he conversation which had transpor ed on the bank of the river appeared abundantly confirmatory of her fears and suspicions. To the young stranger wfio had so opportunely appeared to assist her she felt truly grateful; but the re flection that she had possibly involved him in a quarrel with a dangerous man added much to the anxiety of her mind. She was on the point of making known the state of her feelings to her father, in respect to Le Bland, when he com menced to speak highly in his praise, dwelling particularly upon his gentle manners and the frankness which char acterized him in every act in life, “I esteem him.” added Mr. Alston, "for his numerous good qualities—for the kindness of his heart, for the dignity and refinement of his manners and for all those noble traits which constitute true manhood.” Rosalthe felt her blood mounting tu multuously to her cheeks, and tears of regret filling her eyes. She was much pained that a man of her father’s dis crimination should be so egregiously de ceived in the Frenchman’s character. But she was misapprehended; for Alston, ob serving her confusion, attributed it whol ly to another cause and remarked, with a meaning smile, that ‘‘she need not be confused about the matter, for he fully appreciated her feelings and should not reproach her for anything that might have passed between Le Bland and her self, of whose honorable intentions he was entirely persuaded.” A.nd to make Rosalthe’s position more mortifying. Mrs. Alston observed in re lation to the subject of her husband’s eulogy: “That he was a very pleasant gentleman, and she hoped her daughter would be so fortunate as never to form any acquaintances less respectable: and she should not object to her preferences when they were so judiciously made, as in the present instance.” Mr. Alston then hinted that he was a man of wealth and was about to make a large purchase of land lying on the opposite bank of the Kentucky river. He stated that the idea was a gcod one, end would prove exceedingly profitable, as it would doubtless quadruple in a few years the capital invested. Rosalthe perceived at once that her father’s mind was filled with a splendid bubble, which would burst sooner or later and end in a cruel disappointment. Whether her fears magnified the danger and trial in reserve for her or himself, time only could prove; but it was plainly appar ent to her that the wily Frenchman ex ercised almost unbounded influence over her father’s movements. It appeared to her that the time had come to speak boldly and reveal all that her promise did not oblige her to lock within her own bosom. She could assure her father that he had completely mis taken her sentiments in regard to Le Bland, and that she disliked him with more real intensity than she was sup posed to love him. , While thoughts of this nature were passing rapidly through her mind, the door was opened by Ebony, the colored servant, and the subject of her thoughts entered the cabin. He glanced quickly from one to the other, greeting them with his accustomed suavity. He took a seat near Mr. Alston and conversed with him in that peculiar, agreeable, easy and confidential manner which had so won upon his esteem. Rosalthe could overhear but little of what was said, but she often caught such words as “land, loans, investment,” which induced her to believe that the land speculation was the one under dis cussion. Le Bland finally arose and approached our heroine and said to her in a low voice: “Pardon my earnestness this morning. My desire to save you from what ap peared a pressing danger made me, I fear, somewhat rude. I am happy to say now that I was not correctly inform ed in regard to Captain Du Quesne and his intentions. You may sleep in safety, fair Rosalthe. and rest assured that there is one who will shield you from Indian cruelty.” “Then you free me from my position?” returned Rosalthe. “No, gentle Rosalthe,” he answered, in his most engaging tones. “I cannot ab solve you from your promise; for speak ing of the subject might produce unnec essary alarm. Moreover, I design to make further investigation of the matter and learn the real extent of the dan ger. if any exists, your father shall be duly and properly informed of every thing. Take your accustomed walks as though nothing had happened, being careful not to go too far away from the fort, and I promise not to interrupt or you, or speak in relation to any subject not agreeable to you. Deal with me fair ly and truly, and you shall not have an occasion to regret it, I assure you.” (To be continued.) THE 

YANKEE SCHOOLMARM. Southern Tourist’s Tribute to Type of Woman in Xew England. “1 reckon New England will have its schoolmarm as long as it’s rock bound coast lasts,” said a Southern tourist. “I traveled miles in the first colonies during the last summer and I mot these women in towns, at the crossroads, and in the hamlets. I don’t mean the present-day schoolmarm, but the precise, colloquial and trim old lady whose active work is done. “I recall one, and she was a type of many. The trolley car had stopped at a crossroads right out In the country. An elderly woman, whose cheery face illuminated a Quaker bonnet, had hail ed the motorman. “She lifted a telescope case to my seat and I assisted her in boarding the car. She thanked me in such a sin cere way that I felt as if I were again in Dixie. “After she had paid her fare she no ticed that I was interested in an old cemetery which the car was passing. I had asked a fellow passenger the name of the place. He didn't know, but the old schoolmarm knew, and she told me. “She also mentioned the names of some of the dead —names with which the whole country is familiar. When I thanked her she asked in the most precise manner if I was a stranger in that part of the country. I told her it was my first visit. “Then she took the role of guide. Not a crossroads that did not have a bit of history. Every farmhouse was familiar. “ T have spent one or more nights in every farmhouse in this county,’ she said. T taught school hereabouts for thirty years. Every house contains a bit of history which to me is sa cred.’ “Just then another farmhouse was passed. It was about a mile from the road. Pointing it out, she said: “ T attended two funerals and two weddings in that house, and I expoct very soon to attend another wedding there. I boarded there when I was a teacher, a mile back, and the two chil dren. a boy and girl, were my pu pils.’ “ ‘First their mother died and a year later the father. Both are buried in the old graveyard we just passed. The daughter married in the old home stead and I was her bridesmaid. She would have it that way. “ Then her brother married and as a matter of sentiment his wedding oc curred in the same house. I was at that ceremony. His daughter, repre senting the third generation, is to wed beneath the roof a few weeks hence.’ “A little further on the car stopped in the woods. I noticed that the con ductor did not give the motorman the bell. The latter knew where to slow up. “The schoolmarm arose from her seat. I was up in an instant, lifted her telescope from the car and then assist ed her down. I wish I had a picture of the stately courtesy she made. And I wish I had a phonograph cylinder of her correct speech of thanks. “As I boarded the car I looked back. A girl with the most radiant face I ever saw, in a gown of summer lawn, with her hair plaited in rustic fashion and tied with blue ribbon, met the schoolmarm and relieved her of the telescope baggage. Then they disap peared on a winding path. “With this type of woman in the North I do not wonder that the Yan kees were good fighters.” Don’t tack a fancy name on a kid. It makes him a target for his com panions. PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE- Both Houses of Congress Hear Beading. FIRM ON RATE LAW. Corporations, Panama Canal and Many Other Important Topics Are Thor oughly Discussed. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. s.—Pres ident Roosevelt’s message was read to Congress today. It is in substance as follows; The Nation. The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow. Something can be done by legislation to help the general prosperity on a pol icy which shall insure to the advantage or all people who act decently. If the less fortunate man is moved to envy to strike at the conditions under which they both live, the result will be that while damage may come to tin me struck at, it will visit with an even heav ier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we must all go up and down together. Corporations, The corporation has come to stay just as the labor union has come to stay. Each should be favored as long as it does good. Experience has shown that it is use less to try to get an adequate regulation and supervision of great corporations by state action. I believe that ft can be ob tained by the enactment of law by the Congress. If necessary the constitution must be amended. It has been a misfortune that national laws on this subject have been of a pro hibitive rather than an affirmative kind. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another devise. What is needed is not sweeping prohibition but supervision and regulation. Of these abuses perhaps the chief is overcapitalization. Railway Rates Law. It must include putting a complete stop over rebates. The power should be affirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by the Con gress. The most important provision is conferring on some administrative body the power to decide whether a rate is just * * * if unjust, to prescribe the reasonable maximum rate, this to go into effect within a reasonable time, subject to review by the courts, A rebated rate should be made the maximum on all similar transportation. My proposal is not to give the commission power to in itiate or originate rates, but to regulate. The best possible regulation would be an agreement among the railroads to carry out the law. * * * It would put a stop to discriminations. A system of exam ination for railroad accounts similar to that now conducted in national banks should be provided. Present laws have been greatly destroyed by delay in the courts. The question of transoortation lies at the root of all industrial success. We must understand that the public servants who are to do this work must be of the highest type. They must be well paid. Safety Appliances. The Congress should provide for the introduction of block signals on all rail roads engaged in interstate commerce. If there are any reasons for laws limit ing the hours of labor they certainly ap ply to railroad workers with peculiar force. An employers* liability law applicable to all industries within the scope of the federal government should be enacted. Labor.. There has been a demand for depriv ing courts of the power to issue injunc tions in labor disputes. Such limitation would be unwise, * * * Some judges have misused this power, but it does not justify a denial any more than of the power to call a strike for improper exer cise of the power. In such a republic as ours the one thing that we cannot afford to neglect is | the problem of turning out decent citi- the children of today are those who will share the destiny of the land tomor row. , The introduction of wolnen into indus try is working change and disturbance in domestic and social life. The decrease in marriage and especially the birth rate is coincident with it. There is need for knowledge on which to base legislation for protection of working women. If the class spirit grows it will ulti mately prove fatal to us. This government is not and never shall be governed by mob. Each man, rich or l poor, shall be treated simply and solely on his worth as a man. The noblest of all forms of govern ment is self-government; but it also is the most difficult. There are selfish and brutal men in all ranks of life. Insurance. That state supervision is inadequate has already been generally conceded. The United States should follow the pol icy of other nations by providing ade quate federal supervision. The Revenues. Unless our . expenditures can be kept within the revenues, then our revenues must be readjusted. There is more need of stability than to attain ideal perfec tion. The shock and strain to the busi ness world certain to attend any serious | change render such change inadvisable unless for grave reasons. It is yet too ; early to attempt to outline what shape | the readjustment should take. Economy. To cut down on the navy would be a crime against the nation. * To fail to push forward all work on the Panama canal would be as great a folly. All un necessary offices should be abolished. In the public printing also a large saving can be made. Currency. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of elasticity to our j currency system. Business Methods. There is every reason why our execu ( tive government should be at least as well planned as the best machinery of the great business organizations. Federal Elections. Not only should both the national and state Legislatures forbid any officer and a corporation from using the money of I the corporation in any election, but they should forbid the use of such, money in I connection with any legislation except by employment of counsel for distinctly I legal services. Hague Conference. We can do nothing of permanent value i for peace unless we keep in mind our aim is righteousness. We have scant'sympathy with the sen timentalist who dreads oppression less than physical suffering, who would pre fer a shameful peace. As the world is i now, only that national is equipped for peace that knows how to fight if war is demanded. But it remains our clear duty to strive for peace. Monroe Doctrine. That our rights and interests are deep ly concerned in the maintenance of the ; doctrine is clear. This is especially true in view of the Panama canal. It must be understood that under no circum stances will the United States use the doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggres j siou. All this country desires is that the other republics on this continent shall be happy and prosperous. If a republic to the south of us commits a tort against a foreign nation, the doctrine does not force us to interfere to prevent puuish i ment. providing punishment does not as j sume the form of territorial occupation. Santo Domingo. Santo Domingo has made an appeal to ns to help her and not only principle and wisdom but every generous instinct binds us to respond to the appeal. Army and Navy. I do not believe there is any army in the world that has a better average than ours * * * but previous should be made for maneuvers. The number ot posts in time of peace should be dimin ished. Promotion by mere seniority can never result in a thoroughly efficient corps. There should be an increase in the coast artillery force, and increase and reorganization in the medical department. Our navy must always be of greater size than our army. It does not seem to me that the navy should be increased beyond the present number of units, but efficient should be substituted for In efficient units. Probably the resalt would be obtained by adding a single battleship each year. Naturalization Laws. No alien is to be naturalized until at least ninety days after filing his petitici^ Criminal Laws. The delays of the criminal law, no less than of the civil, now amount to a very great evil. Legislation should be enacted to cover breach of trust in the shape of prematurely divulging secrets by an em ploye or officer of the United States. A statute should be provided for punish ment of a United States attorney or oth er officer who corruptly agrees to do wrong, other than for money. Public Land. The iniquitous method of monopolizing public lands are becoming more generally known, but existing laws do not furnish effective remedies. We cannot afford to substitute tenants for freeholders on pub lic domain. All organized opposition to the forest reserves of the west has dis appeared. Merchant Marine. It cannot but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of com munication with our sister republics of South America should be chiefly under foreign control * * * through the lib eral aid bestowed by other governments on their own steam lines. Pensions. That Congress take action toward care for the graves of Confederate dead. The first need is to take charge of the graves of Confederate dead who died in the northern prisons. Immigration. We should have none of the wrong sort. We need more immigration for the south. No emigrants should be allowe<J to come from Canada and Mexico, safe natives of the two countries themselves. Keep immigrants away from the con gested tenement house districts of the great cities.. In the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese laborers grave wrong has been done to the people of China. Chinese students, business and profes sional men should be encouraged to come. We cannot expect to receir* equity (from China) unless we do equity. Civil Service. Written competitive examinations do not make the ideal method, but they rep resent an immeasureably advance upon the “spoils” system. Copyright Laws. Our copyright laws urgently need re vision. Adulteration of Foods. Interstate traffic in foodstuffs which have been debased or adulterated so aa to injure health or deceive purchase* should be forbidden. National Parks. The grand canon of Colorado should be made into a national park. Nothing should be allowed to interfere with the preservation of Niagara Falls. The boundaries of Yellowstone park should be extended to include forest preserve* on the south. Lifesaving Service. Give members of the service pension* such as are given to firemen and police men in all our great cities. Indians. Some amendment of the internal rev enue laws to prosecute “boot'eggerw.” The acts of Congress prohibiting the uhie or gift to L’m (the Indian) of intoxicants has substantially become inoperative. 1 The Philippines. If there has been error as regards giv ing self-government to the Philippines It has been U too quickly. I earnestly rec ommend that the tariff now imposed upon the products of the Philippines be entirely removed except on sugar and td ► Bacco, that thess be reduced, 25 per ceht and removed after July 1, 1909. od primitive are the methods in the island* that it wiU be many years before thg products of these islands will have any effect whatever upon the markets of the United States. The only solution (of labor on the islands) is the training dr the Filipino. Hawaii. Immediate steps should be taken to fortify the island. Hawaii is too heavily taxed. Seventy-five per cent, of the rev enue receipts should be set aside for, say twenty years, for education and improve ments. Hawaii shall never be a territory in which a governing class of rich plant ers exists by means of coolie labor. Porto Rico. Legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rico. Insular Affairs in General. We have been paying all heed to the political and educational interests qt these islands, but it is uot less important that we should favor their industrial development. Alaska. Alaska be given an elective delegate. Admission to Statehood. Indian territory and Oklahoma be ad mitted as cue state and that New Mex ico and Arizona be admitted as one state. Panama Canal, What is needed without delay is an appropriation by Congress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission. Neither at homo or abroad is there a sufficient working force to do the busi ness properly. The salary list should be adjusted. Game Butchers. Earl De Grey, the heir to the Marquis of Ripon. has probably accounted for more game than any other living sports man. Four years ago the German Emperor had in the course of nearly thirty years bagged about 40,000 head of game. But so far back as 1805 Lord De Grey had eclipsed this record eight times over, says the Yorkshire Post, having in twen ty-nine years bagged 316,690 head. Of this enormous total the chief items comprised 111,190 pheasants, 89,400 partridges, 45,500 grouse. 26,500 hares and about the same number of rabbits. In Ireland a few years ago he brought down sixteen geese with one gun (two barrels) In 1893 alone he accounted for 19,135 head, including 8732 partridges, 5760 pheasants. 2611 grouse, 837 hares, 914 rabbits and 300 beasts of the field. The record for grouse shooting is, however, held by Lord Walsiugham. During one day’s shoot on the Blubber house moors, in Yorkshire, in August, 1872, with the expenditure of 1100 car tridges, he brought down 421 brace of grouse. On August 30, 

ISSB, he was shooting for 14 hours 18 minutes, and by firing an average of 108 shots an hour he succeeded in bringing down 1058 birds. The Unflattering Barher. John Drew, as he lunched, talked about barbers. “They are so uncomplimentary,” he said. “They tell you such unflattering things. “A friend of mine went to be shaved at the Dark Harbor hotel one day last summer, and the barber said to him: “ ‘Your hair is getting thin, sir.’ “ ‘Yes,’ ray friend answered, tartly. ‘I have been treating it with antifat. 1 never did like stout hair.’ ” —New York Tribune. Thomas B. Reed was supposed to wear a larger collar than any other man In New Ev gland. NEW CARDINALS FOREIGN MEN. POPE FOR EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ITALLA.NS AND OTHERS IN SACRED COLLEGE. Pontiff Declares That While Faith Is Spreading in Distant Lands There Is Some Concern. ROME. Dec. 11.—The Pete today held a secret consistory, which was the second of his pontificate, in which he created new cardinals and apparently showed a tendency to have a better equi librium between the foreign and Italian elements in the sacred college. Three of the four now cardinals are foreign ers. The ceremony was performed with the usual pomp, and nearly thirty cardinals were present. The pontiff appeared walking and preceded by, surrounded and followed by the gorgeous pontifical court. Then all withdrew except the members of the sacred college and the Pope read his allocution. News Not All Consoling. In it he said he wished he could give the cardinals such pleasant and consol ing news, but the conditions at the pres ent time do not permit of consolation. Although, he continued, the Roman Catholic faith is spreading more and more throughout the world, especially in distant countries, on turning toward Catholic nations one feels sadness and fear lest the prediction of the Scriptures is being verified, that the kingdom of the Lord would be moved to other peo ple, where it will produce good fruit. Especial care and anxiety may be felt for the country heretofore called the eldest daughter of the church, but con cerning the anti-Catholic laws passed there against the laws of justice the Pope said he would speak in accord ance with his apostolic office more grave ly and more fully at an opportune time. He exhorted the cardinals to prayer, re calling that the Lord will cause tranquil lity and peace to shine forth at the prop er time. New Cardinals Named. The pontiff ended with saying that he intends to honor the whole Latin Ameri can race by creating for the first time a cardinal belonging to that part of the world. Immediately after reading his allocution he created the following car dinals: Most Rev. Joseph Semasse, archbish op of Erlau, Hungary; Mgr. Spinole, archbishop of Seville; Mgr. J. A. De Arcoverde De Alburquerque Cavalcanti, archbishop of Rio Janeiro; Mgr. Cagaino De Azevedo. major domo of the Vati can. The cardinals asserted that contrary tc the popular impression the Pope did not create a fifth cardnal, but reserved the appointment in pectore. Announces Bishop Schinner. Later the Pope appointed a number of bishops, including the following: Rev. G. Barin, bishop of Nureva Ca ceres, Philippine Islands; Rev. T. Mcer schaert, bishop of Oklahoma; Rev. T. Brennan, formerly bishop of Dallas, Tex., titular bishop of Cassarea, and Rev. A. Schinner, vicar general of Mil waukee, bishop of Superior. Mgr. Nozaleda, formerly archbishop of Manila, afterwards archbishop of Valen cia. which post he resigned, was nomi nated titular archbishop of Petra. WINTER GRAINS REPORTED Wheat Condition on December i Wr.s 94. x and Rye 95.4—Averages Higher Than Last Year, WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. il.— The crop reporting board of the bureau of statistics of the department of agri culture finds from the reports of the correspondents and agents of the bureau as follows: The newly seeded area of winter wheat Is estimated at 31,341,000 acres, an Increase of 0.6 per cent, over the area sown In the fall of 1904.
