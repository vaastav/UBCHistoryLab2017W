Chicago tribune. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 18. 1863. BEFORE FREDERICKSBURG. Our army is again on the north hank of the Rappahannock, The crossing was gal lant. the attack was brave, the recall was necessary and the whole reflects no stain of dishonor upon our arms. The brave men who sadly turned their backs upon the enemy, burned to press once more in the path strewn by their fallen comrades. These troops, gathered from thirteen States, might Lave beca hurled again and again upon the serried batteries of the foe, and their blood wasted like water on the fatal plateau; they would have won or perished, hut Gcn.Bumflclehas called them back. In this he has shown himself truly brave, for it is bravery to resist the temptation that presses upon a commander, so circum stanced, logo forward. And now he will be brave enough for anything that the situation demands, and this will probably be winter riuarters. The murderous folly of pretend ing to held a winter .campaign in Virginia Should not be again committed. That pre tence last year meant only an army win tering without suitable quarters. Let the army be put into comfortable huts, if it be Mot proposed to move thpm against the enemy, and no senseless clamors will come if]) from the people. There will he enough transpiring further south to attract rebel » attention, and encourage loyal hearts, Burnside, take good care of your men now, unless you are going to use them. The first is nec essary, if the last is impossible. AND WHEBS IS BANKS ? The exciting and ‘ unsuccessful events that have ended with the re-crossing of the Rappahannock, are on eveiy tongue. Our army went forward bravely, fought gal lantly, suffered sevciely, and under cover of night again resumed their old positions t north of the river. Reviewing all this, loyal men bite their lips in chagrin and dis appointment, and scan the dim hints of the » telegrams to find some consolation in the promise that Gen. Banks is soon to burst in upon flic scene in Virginia. Evidently it is not to he. The last hope of the kind has faded out. Gen. Banks has' sailed, se cure from questioning or surmise, out of possibility of participation in the fall of Richmond, save by indirect and remote in fluence. . To say that a Tote of the loyal men of the couutiy, -were the elective franchise to regulate military movements, would have i sent Gen. Banks into Southern Virginia, is to say what our readers, will readily be lieve. In that be did)not go thither is a cause of disappointment lending a present darker shade to the gloom of Fredericks burg. But let ns look at the matter. "We must refer elsewhere to the view we are able to present ot the operations at Fred ericksburg. They may be summed up in the fact that our army in splendid fighting trim has abandoned its. first intention on account of difficulties deemed iusurmount s* able. It is ready for a new essay, before V .vliich however, winter quarters may, and probably will intervene, in which event it js located where it can be well and easily cared for until the period for activity re turns. In a word, the disaster means only delay. We have an array in Virginia that jnean to bike Richmond. And who shall say because Gen. Banks has not gone to the approaches of Rich mond from the Southward tliat that field 3s neglected? The rebel journals are full * *of the idea that there is a large recent ac cession of Federal troops in that direction, and their evident uneasiness'may re-assure us. We hate doubtless sent large rein forcements to strengthen the commands . that the rebels believe, and we believe, are \o move northward from Suffolk and Wel don. So let us hope the programme is going forward, if without Gen. Banks. But where is Banks? Wcarcnot in the pccrets of the War Department. If we knew, we could not tell. As we do not know, there is no law against guessing. •31c has gone to Hew Orleans, where by this time Jus fleet Is probably arriving. He left Hew York on the 4th. It was the president's own remark that u the expedi tion would not be heard from before ten days at leash” This could not be were it to fall short of doubling the capes of Flori- He has not been heard from yet though the rumors have come back noting the putting in of vessels from his fleet into points on the Horth Carolina coast, and 1 Port Royal, strengthening our forces at those places. But what will Gen. Banks do at Hew Orleans; We are prepared to helievethat great and exceeding dread is about to fell upon the rebels from this cause. He has tome down to take possession of the rich est portion of tlie rebel South. He will be t'u the ground when the 'mailed hand of * Vne President as Commaadcr-in-Chief lets 5n the light of Liberty upon the million -V a ves of that fairest region of Secessla. He to scizc and enforce the great miliary necessity - 6f destroying Slavery Hat the Union may See. Take your map and a pair of compasses. Place one point • on Hew Orleans as a centre, and the other on Apalachicola Bay in Florida. How gweep the circuit north ward and westward jmd extend the arc until iftouches the golf coast of Texas. This is to be the field of operations of Gen. Banks. When ice and ' pnow thicken around the winter huts of Burnside’s army, the forces of Banks will £nd no impediments in the season, to sweep ■ their entire field. It is full of the great staples of the South. Jt is full of blacks, sent thither for security from more perturbed regions northward. Jt is full of rebels in whose hearts is only malice and hatred to the Union, and from Muong whom loyal’men have been crushed out with an iron hand. It is*the innermost seat of the rebellion, the cherished centre of which the Rappahannock line is but an outpost. Into this centre has sailed Gen. ' Banks. r He has arrived in season for the first of January. He will be to the South and to civilization, the almoner of the President’s great Hew Tear s gift to Humanity, a gift bom of the necessities of this war. Gen. Bank’s is there ready to commence at the very point of progress where Gen. Hunter was stopped on the 19th of Hay last The work of seizure and confiscation, and liberation will go on apace.,. The Presi dent will open flood gates with a full head • on, Gen. Banks has gone to idke possession of the South, and in two weeks the Presi ' .Sent will say, in words of more import - titan were ever before accorded to mere human utterance, “It is Tara.” For this undertaking Gen. Banks’ expe dition is expressly made up. His heavy . mailed craft will thunder at the fortressed entrances of gulf harbors; his light draft i s war vessels will sweep the bays and cstu- that indent the gulf coast. He vpll, 1- by virtue of military possession, make use ship loader more, of coarse uni forms, about which the seccah organs have ■ ; been irdnUy grumbling, every jacket jr ail d. trowsers of which will encase V. a stout negro, aimed with a fed «r #*ral musket, and, under the promise of ■ Liberty, a soldier for the Union.' He | wifi confiscate plantations and blacks, and \ all of the latter not called to bear arms : willbeget-nt work upon the problem of Free Labor, the experiment o the holy 

VOLUME XV. institutions of Home and Marriage secured to their humble cabins by the same instru ment that punishes the rebel master. In nil this, the torch of insurrection and servile war will not be lighted. Held firmly by the hand of the commander of the Department the civilization of the freedmen will find scope enough for pro cess in other directions than in acts of savagery. The Government has felt its way carcflilly along to the fact that the black makes a good soldier, will fight in the field, and is not a tailless monkey. But will Gen. Banks supersede Gen. Butler? Ko, unless the Government has need for the quick, firm, practical traits of Gen. Butler nearer the centre of our power. The two Generals will harmo niously work together until but one is needed, unless a greater necessity inter venes to call one elsewhere. The mission of Gen. Banks is a noble one and fitly en trusted to a commander who quietly has grown from an oppointee from the civil list into an officer upon whom even "West Point looks with respect. He will, reopen the Mississippi and hold it open* will tame Mobile, and shake hands with Grant and Bosecrnns ere spring puts on her first early garb. This is the mission of General Banks. TEE H.IRP OF A THOUSAND STRINGS. The 2scw York Commercial Advertiser's "Washington young man is succeeded by the ancient of the concern in playing upon the harp of a thousand strings, the head t hereof resemhieth the late head of the Potomac arm}'. And what the ancient discovered is reported hy the Associated Press elsewhere under head ot personal intelligence. Gen. McClellan ha* been ordered to Washington .and is now in coupullation with the President and Cabinet. Anything definite relative to this re port we have failed to loam. Ila, sayest thou so? "Well we and the public must imagine the rest. Forinstance is it not likely that the opportunity was chosen for pointing out to little Mac, the evils his stick-in-the-mud policy has visited upon the country by wasting all the good fall weather, and thrusting Burnside and Lis atmy afoul of the snows and ice of De cember. The President and Cabinet would undoubtedly take occasion to give Mc- Clellan a sound rating for all this. But the good old newspaper has found some thing in this connection fully ns remarka ble as the confession that it don’t know anything about McClellan s being called to ■Washington for consultation. A ucntlcman intimately acquainted with all *hc doings of Government eald this morning that he would not l*c surprised to hear that MVcldlau i» now at the Capital on important business. A gentleman intimately acquainted with all the doings of government is a personage it will pay to know,-especially ibout a newspaper office. We desire to ask of the Advertise) 1 “Who is your friend?” “He would not he surprised” wouldn't he ? Imperturbable fellow, perhaps he is principled against it, ns any one so largely in the confi dence of the Government ought to he. But seriously, Sir. Craig of the Associated Press, were there' no fires in Brooklyn, no runaways in Broadway, no robberies, thefts, rapes, arsons, no police court intelli gence in Gotham yesterday, that you must a second time afflict the Western press with the incohcrencics of McClellan’s asphyxiated admirers? No answer ex pected. 

WEST VIRGINIA. As far as Congress can accomplish it, West "Virginia is already in the Union. Wc give elsewhere the admirable argu ment of Hon. Schuyler Colfax for its ad mission. Old conservatism is eager to hold the President back from signing the bill. The new State consists of forty-eight coun ties as follows: Barbour, Boone. Braston. Brooke. Cabell. Cal houn. Clay. Doddridge. Fayette, fUlmer. Green brier. Hampshire, Hancock. Hardy, Harrison. Jackson. Kanawha, Lewis, Logan, Marion, Mar shall. Mason, KcDowell, Mercer. Monongalia. Monroe. Morgan. Nicholas? Ohio, Pendleton, Pleasants. Pocahonta®, Preston. Pntnam. Raleigh. Randolph. Ritchie, Roane, Taylor. Tucker. Tyler. Tpshur. Wayne, Webster, Wetzel, Wirt, Wood, Wyoming. These counties contain a third of a mil lion of white people, (45,000 more than there are in South Carolina, and nearly as many as in Mississippi or Louisiana.) and only 13,271 slaves, or less than four to each hundred whites. The white population has increased 81,233 or 32 per cent, in ten years; the slaves have decreased nearly a thousand, or six and a-half per cent, in the same period. The whole of old Virginia in the same ten years gained 17 per cent only on her white population, and seven per cent, on her slaves; the entire increase being only twelve and a-half per cent. GEN. 

BUTLER. The secesh organs arc filled with wrath and bitterness against Gen. Butler and have been working diligently-to displace him. It will he the grimmest of jokes to accom modate Fernando Wood and his friends, whose mouth-piece is the Kew York Wo)id, by substituting Banks for Butler. The lit tle finger of Banks will he thicker tlian Butler’s loins,when the President’s Procla mation is given the latter wherewith to fin ish up the rebellion. The Lai o Kcv. Artliu r B. Fuller. Among those who fell in the attack on Fredericksburg, last Friday, in the passage across the river to disperse the rebel sharp shooters, was the Rev. Arthur B. Fuller, chnphiin of the 16th Massachusetts regiment. He was shot through the right side, above the hip. Mr. Fuller was an esteemed preacher in Boston, and a brother of the late Margaret Fuller (Countess D'Ossoli.) He was married only a short time previous to the breaking out of the rebellion, and leaves a wife and child. His remains were embalmed, and have been forwarded to Boston. Deceased had many friends and admirers in our own city, I upon whom the intelligence will fall sadly. THE WAR IN 

ARKANSAS. Fayetteville. Ark-, Dec. 15, via Elk Horn 17.—The following additional particu lars of the battle of Prairie Grove have been received; The official reports places theloss of killed and wounded in Qcn. Herron's com mand at 843; in Geu. Blunts 152. Total U95. The latest accounts increase the rebel loss to 2,700 killed and wounded, and nearly 6,000 by desertion. * ‘ - Thirty-five commissioned officers of Gen. Herron’s command arc killed or wounded. Latest information by spies say Hindman is on the south side of the Arkansas River with all his infantry and artillery, and Marmaduke on the north side with a heavy cavalry force. Our outposts are within twenty miles of Van Burcn. The forage south of the Boston Mountains is said to be entirely consumed. - Great activity prevails in the Federal army. A campaign of much interest is on the tapis Gen. Herron had only 3,500 men in the bat tle, the remainder of his force filling to come np on account of .excessive fatigue. Major Hubbard, of the Ist Missouri cavalry, who was a prisoner in the bands of the enemy on the day of battle, counted twenty-lwo regiments of infantry, ten regiments of cav alry, and twenty-two pieces of artillery, on the retreat. , .. .. Hindman yesterday had the impudence, by Hag of truce, to request the privilege to send topographical engineers to make.a drawing of the battle-field of Prairie Grove and its ap proaches. Gen. Blunt replied that he would grant the request when he was allowed an en gineer to make a survey of Van Buren and Surroundings. Morcoftbe Alabama. 2?ew Tobk, Nov. 17.—The schooner J. -W.

FEDERAL LOSS KILLED 750- WOUHDED 4,OOO—MISSING 500—TOTAL 5,250. v4&7ra|y|. FREDERICKSBURG AND VICINITY. Our map will give a very clear idea of the new theatre of war, of which Fredericksburg is the centre. The scale on which it is drawn gives a tcrritoiy of about forty miles from north to south. To give an adequate idea of the difllculties before .which the army of Burnside is temporarily withdrawn, it must be understood that our force did not impinge upon a position freshly chosen and hurriedly fortified by the enemy; so fiir from this, it was a line of defense chosen early in the war. This line may bo traced on a larger map, cx- tending along Ibc precipitous bank of theßap j-abannock Elver, from Port Royal up to Fredericksburg, tlicncc along the Soutli bank of Ibc river up as far as Ibe junction of tbe Rapidan with the north, lork of the Rappa hannock, a distance of about seventy miles, was carried tlicncc along tbe Rapidan as far as the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Thus Pope’s array struck this line of de fense on tbe Rapidan and recoiled before its strength. At tbe breaking out of tbe rebellion it this a matter of serious discussion by Beauregard, Lee and Johns! ».u whether Ibis should not be tbe line of fouliieatiou instead of Bull Run and Manassas. Tbe Manassas railroad bring- ing provisions from tbe valley, caused tbemto select Bull Run, the Rapidan and Rappahan nock being made strong by extensive military engineering in the meantime. There cannot be less than 180,000 rebels along this line of fortification, between Port Royal and the base of ibe mountains. Upwards of 20,000 have been at Fredericksburg since the 10th of May, XSGI, and laboring men have been at work on various fortifications all along the river bank for months past. Tills line of defense was be gan anterior to the fortifications along Bull Run, and was destined as a sort of a cover in case of defeat at Bull Run. This understanding of the situation is nec essary for a full conception of tbe nature of recent operations, and tbe cheek our arms tbe Ny, is indicated by a line reaching from have received. Tbe river is deep and narrow below Fredericksburg—l6o yards wide and fifteen feet deep. Above Fredericksburg and at Falmouth the great falls of the Rappahan nock begin, and extend all the way to the £.ourcc. The banks arc rugged, broken, and precipitous, and covered with tbe original growth of timber. Tbe river here is deep and rapid, rising at limes—in the spring and early summer —as much as thirty feet, sweeping the bridges away at Falmouth and Fredericks burg, as has been tlic ease twice during the last twelve months. Tilt? country immediately south of the north course just marked out is strikingly like that on the south sidS of the Potomac above Georgetown, very hilly—both wild, deep ra vines ; particularly is this the case for some eight miles helow Fredericksburg, all the way up to the base of the mountain ridge. There is a wooden bridge at Fredericksburg leading over the Rappahannock and the county of Stafford, and one at the village of Falmouth, which is in Stafford county, leading over the river in the county of Spottsylvania. Fal mouth is a mile above Fredericksburg, aud Hare arc but three fords in the river between Fredericksburg and the mountains.. By the map we give the general’position of onr forces is given the rebel line reaching from Port Koyal in a broad arc whose left rested on the river npon Fredericksburg. The lines of the opposing armies were op posed thus; Hooeeh, Longstreety SniNEB, The Federal army crossed on the morning of Thursday, 11th, fought the battle 'which raged along the whole line on Saturday, and under the cover of darkness and. storm of Sunday night rccrosscd, cutting off all con nections by removing the pontoons. On Monday the enemy's pickets were again con fronting onr own on the South bank of the Rappahannock. . [Special Dispatchto the Chicago Tribune.] Baltxhoue, Dec. IT. 1862. The condition of afihirs on the Rappahan nock now is that Burnside andhis entire army with the Federal wounded arc all safely and successfully on this side the Rappahannock, and the pontoon bridges taken up. There has been some cannonading across the river. The rebels arc entrenched as they were before the battle. Burnside alleges there vras a military neces sity to fight or retire across tiic river. The enemy's fortifications proved too strong to be taken without an unprecedented expenditure of life. -The Federal troops continue in good spirits and Burnside* is preparing for a rigorous movement. His army has been largely rein- forced. There Is no diminution of hope at Wash- legion. A fill ire towards Suffolk and throughout that region axo working encouragingly. . [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] WASnm'QTOJf, Dec. IT, 1863. The proportion of the killed and wounded in the late tattle Is about one-third more than in any other battle of the •war. Some 3,000 wounded, from Fredericksburg, were brought up to Washington to-night. The statements that the army is discouraged or demoralized by recent events, are contra dicted on the best authority. The government is to-night sending down tents aud hospital comforts. A flag of truce was sent over to-day to bury the dead. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washington, Dec. 17,1662. This morning’s Republican, which of late lias enjoyed the reputation, to some extent, of reflecting Secretary Chase’s views Ms ahighly significant editorial on the recent battle ofi* which the following is au extract: For ourselves we hope that as a few weeks will terminate the ordinary winter of this lat itude, the army designed-for the defense of Washington wiU go at once into winter quar ters. It may seem an unnecessary aud too obvious a suggestion that it is the season to go into winter quarters. It is very easy for people in comfortable bouses with warm fires and warm Tsbdsto object to soldiers going into winter quarters. That sort of clamor kept our army all last winter sickening and dying under tents, when they onght to have been hutted, as was done by the more sensible rebels. It is in the south ;md southwest, and not in Virginia, that win ter campaigns cm be conducted with advan tage. At any rate it docs not become those who sustained the inaction of our army da ring the pleasant months of fall, to now make outcry if it waits for weeks until winter breaks, before undertaking active operations. This morning's Chronicle, the guusi organ of the administration, has the following on the same subject: If war should be successfully prosecuted in the Gulf States, it would make but little dif ference whether the. army of the Potomac should do anything or not. The rebel army at Richmond would’be cooped up, and would starve in two weeks, or else have to fight at disadvantages. The progress of Grant down in Mississippi has frightened the rebel leaders. They Rave sent Gcu. Johnston out there to insure suc cess. Headquarters Abut op the Potomac. )_ Dec. 17, ISU2. ) “Weather cold with a northeast wind. Last night the enemy increased their in trenchments on the terrace, in the rear of Fredericksburg, and threw up rifle pits near the river on the left of the city. To-day their battalion drills were visible to the naked eye on the plain. No movement of importance has taken place to-day. Our troops arc In excellent condition, and as enthusiastic as they were previous to the late engagement. ' [SpecialDispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] WAsuixoto*. Dec. 17, IS&i. Col.

Dennis gives the following estimate of losses, which looks more rational than any wc have been having lately: Killed, 750; : wounded, 4,000; missing, 500; in all, 5,250. Some sensation has been produced in Por ter’s court martial, by the production of Por ter’s private dispatches to McClellan and Burnside. These, Porter thought, ofso much consequence, that on learning that Pope would prefer charges against him, he went to the telegraph office, and forced the operator to give them up. The original copies hap pened to have been taken at the telegraph office in the War Department, as they were passing over the lines, and these put in as evidence. In one dispatch, speaking of one of Pope’s movements of troops, Porter says: “Pope himself has gone to Centreville to-day with two corps for a body guard.” In another, he says: “I hope that Me. is at work to get ns out of this.*' The whole tone of the dis patches shows hostility to Pope and contempt for his plans and movements. New Tore, Dec. 17. —The Philadelphia ims publishes a dispatch from Burnside to Halleck, received at 9 o’clock Tuesday night. Burnside says: Peeling fully-convinced that the position in front conld not be carried, it was a militaiy necessity either to attack or retreat. Are pulse would have been disastrous under the circumstances. The army was withdrawn without the loss of a man or of property. Falmouth, Dec. 17-—Yesterday morning the enemy seemed astounded to find us on this side of the river. About 9 o'clock in the evening they ad vanced skirmishers along the entire line, es tablishing pickets near the river bank. Wc had a large number of dead on what was regarded on ncutralground. The rebels were plainly seen robbing the bodies. At 11 o'clock ladies were seen walking in the streets of Predericksbnrg. On Monday General Franklin sent a Hag of truce for an exchange of dead, which was done. Fillkklik, Jackson. ‘ Yesterday Lee sent a flag to Burnside, ask-' ing him to detail men to bury his dead in* front of Sumner's division. During the flag of truce the rebel General Stuart, in answer to a question, said Banks had gone Sonth, but did not know where. Our entire army is now encamped on the ground previously occupied. The army has been considerably reinforced. The opinion of military men is that if we had taken the first ridge of works, their opportunity for slaugh tering us would have.beengreater thanpre* viously. No troops in the world could with stand such concentrated fire of ordnance and musketry. New Yoke, Dec. 17.—The morning papers are filled with detailed accounts of Saturday’s fighting, of too extended a nature for tele graphing. They contain no real news, but comprise mainly the incidents relating to the affair. The New- York Tima gives the following, account of the withdrawal of our. troops from Fredericksburg. It says: “ The move ment commenced at darken Monday'night. AH the sick and wounded were removed during the day lo hospital tents on this side. Gen. Burnside inspected, the position of CHICAGO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1862. the troops in the afternoon, and general ac tivity indicated lhat another battle was immi nent. Surgeons were ordered to be in readi ness to care for a large number of additional wounded. The withdrawal of our forces,how ever, was determined on at a council of all corps commanders during the day. The un dertaking was regarded as perilous, but, if successful, would rescue the army from another battle, which would accomplish little except the destruction of valuable lives. The troops bad received no intimation .of a retreat, and had laid down on their aims for the night. When the order was given to hill in, the troops supposed it was for a night assault on the enemy's works, and were not-undeceived until they found themselves on the pontoons crossing the ttseam. The bridges were covered .with earth to deaden the sound of artillery. A high wind and the darkness prevented the rebels from hearing or seeing the movement. Franklin’s division moved as soon as it was dark, also Sumner’s.and.Hooker’s. from under the verv guns of the ‘ enemy, Many officers and sol diers expressed great regret, saying they pre ferred dying in front of. the rebel batteries. Very few of the wounded were left on the field. Two brigades occupy the town as advanced pickets, and our artillery on the higher bank will co-operate in keeping possession of the town. Our heavy guns opened on the rebel batteries on Tuesday morning, eliciting little response. The New York Timas’ correspondent thus describes the rebel position our forces were expected to jtorm and take: There is a?bare plateau of a third of a mile which the storming parly will have to cross. In doing this they wlJl be exposed to the fire of the enemy’s sharpshooters posted behind a stone wall running along the base of the ridge, double rifle juts on tfie rise of the crest, heavy batteries behind strong picket works that stud the tox> of the lull, a powerful in fantry force now lying concealed behind these, of a plunging fire from the batteries on the lower range," and of a double enfilading fire from the cannon to the left of them. Sebastopol •was wot ball’ so strong. The New Tork Time .>’ account of Saturday's battle shows that Hooker’s grand division was on this side of tJie river until 4 o’clock. Al 4, Hooker, who had not yet been across the river, proceeded over,remarking to afriend that he was goingto u put this tliingthrongh.” In half an hourprodigious volleys of musketry announced that Hooker, with* the reserves, was engaged. The last assaulting column con sisted of a division of Humphrey’s, Monk’s, Howard's, Getty's and Sykes'. They had, however, hardly got fairly engaged before the sun went down, and night closed around the combatants. Philadelphia. Dee.fi. —The "Washington Slvr has au article pointing out the misman agement in regard to the pontoon bridges and repairs to the Aquia Creek railroad, and asks for an investigation by Congress, to ascerfedn who is to blame for the delay that has ren dered abortive the plans of Burnside’s com mand’ Gen. Meagher’s wound was slight. Ho was struck by a spent ball in the thigh. It is reported that Brig. Gen. Lyle, 90th Pennsylvania, was killed.

Times.] On Friday four companies of the Eighth Illinois cavalry, under Major Beveridge, made a reconnoisance toward the rebel earthworks. They went sufficiently near io count the guns —eight in number —in one battery. The reb els did not offer to fire upon them, probably from the fact of- their being unable to depress their guns to the proper degree. THE REGIMENTS ENGAGED. RUMORED MOVE3IEST FROM NEWDERN. Nbw York, Dec. 16,1562. The United States steam transport Ge6rgc C. Collins arrived at this port on Saturday night from Newbem, N. C. Newbem was the scene of active military preparative, for a march into the interior of the State. Nearly all the available force was ordered to join in the movement. The indi cations were that there would be a combined attack of naval and laud forces at a point not far distant from Newbem. ' The soldiers seemed in excellent spirits at a prospect for changing the monotonous duties of camp life for active and immediate service. The expedition will be large, aud at the time the steamer sailed there was a prospect that it would soon move on its way. Large detach ments of soldiers to fill up the regiments had arrived. rqm mm km mm Latest from Grant's Army. Trade ou tlie Louver Mississippi [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] "Washington, Dec. 17,18G2. The Treasury Department has advices from the Lower Mississippi showing that unarmed steamboats are going down the Mississippi much further than the gunboats do—clear into acknowledged rebel territory, and trad ing supplies for cotton. The Department has no power to prevent this without military force. A distinguished United States Senator said, to-day, he had reasons for making the pre diction that • the Mississippi River would be open from Cairo to the gulf within ten days. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, December 17,15G2. Passengers from Oxford, as late as Thurs day night, report that all was quiet in that vicinity when they left. The army will prob ably not all move from there for some time, Gen. Grant having to await needed supplies and a better condition of the roads. At Jackson, Tcnn., on Thursday, there were fears of a visit from rebels said to have concentrated in force a short distance outside the town. The streets were barricaded with cotton and cannon placed, and during the * whole day the troops, notwithstanding the rain, kept under arms vainly awaiting the j arrival of the rebels. They did not come, (however. Some cotton left exposed had been burned near Jackson, and other things occur red to create an impression that the enemy were coming. The steamer Graham arrived to-day and brought Memphis papers of the 12th, but they contain nothing important. Gen. Prank Blair and staff were in Memphis on Monday, cn route for Helena. T. H. Tcatman, special agent of the Trcasu iy Department, has issued an order allowing steamers to land at any point between Helena and Cairo to receive on board cotton or other freight, which they are. to report to the Col lector of Customs at the first port of entry, but not to be allowed to discharge freight of any kind unless the same is set forth in the permit, and the ‘place of landing designated on the boat’s clearance. All violations of this order will be promptly reported by aids. Cairo, Dec. 17.— Another expedition, con sisting of the 81st Ohio, Oth Illinois, and a section of the Ist Missonri artillery, has left Corinth to give chase to the rebels. It is re ported on what seems good authority that a considerable force of rebel cavalry, supposed to be Morgan's, has been threatening Jackson . for several days. Ample-preparations have been made to repulse them. The sSth Illinois is here on its way to Springfield, where it goes for the purpose of recruiting. This regiment is_ reduced to less than 800, including paroled prisoners. Personal* New Yobs, Dec. 17.—The Commercial Ad i’&rtiser of this city states that there is a rumor afloat that McClellan has been ordered to Washington, and that he is.nowin consulta tion with the President and Cabinet. Any thing definite relative to the truth of this report wc have failed to learn, but a gentle man, intimately acquainted with all the doings of the Government, said this morning that fie would not be surprised if McClellan was now at the Capital on Important business.

Another of Secretary Jacob Thompson’s captured letters has been published, dated in 1859. It refers to the acquisition of Cuba, by fillibustcrs, and says emphatically that Bu chanan’s administration is favorable to its scheme. It enclosed §IO,OOO, to be used in buying up Southern editors lu behalf of the filllbusters. . Sigel is summoned to appear before the McDowell Court of Inquiry. It is slated that Senator Saulsbury, of Dela ware, was arrested last night as a political prisoner, by an officer with authority from the War Department, as he was walking along on the pavement in front of the President’s house. He drew a sword cane and demanded by what authority it was attempted, but the officer forced him to submit quietly, and he took the advice. Such is the story. lam not able yet lo fully verify it. The Deficiency bill reported in the House to-day amounts to $107,000,000. The Invalid Pension Appropriation bill is also reported of $7,000,000. Mr. Gurley of Ohio, offered a resolution re cently calling for all the correspon dence between McClellan and the President and heads of departments during or concerning the Peninsula campaign. Ir is probable it will soon be furnished. Some highly interesting revelations are expected, which are said by those who ought to know, to sfford’a perfect vindication of Mr. Lincoln. 

SECOND DISPATCH. • [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] * WASBiKGTOif, Dec. 17,1562. A caucus of border State Senators and Rep resentatives was held last night, but nothing very definite agreed upon. The story of Saulsbury’s arrest has rather a farcial termination. It turns out that he was slightly hilarious, got Into some difficulty in the street, and was required to be taken lii charge by a police officer. That’s all. Another Republican Senatorial caucus was held to-day. The quest ion of arrests was sup posed to be the subject of consideration, but the conclusions arc unknown. The Cabinet appointments will undoubtedly * be made In a few days. All agree that it now lies between Holt and Usher. Holt has been approved on the ground of not being a Re publican, and Usher has been urgedas coming from the same State with the present incum bent, and is already familiar with the duties of the Department. The President is believed to desire the appointment of Holt, but the heaviest pressure has been for Usher aud the chaneft are now decidedly in his favor. Some heads of Bureaus in the Department say that Usher is already appointed. James E. Murdock, the eminent tragedian of Cincinnati, is here. The Indiana delegation have recommended Gens. Kimball and Milroy for Major General ship, and Cols. McGinnis of the Hth, Given of the 7th, Graham of the 53d, aud Lieut. Goh Dunn of the 29th for Brigadier Generals. Gen. Hallcck has recommended Gen. Rey nolds, also of Indiana, for a Major General siap. -- - Gov. Robinson and Adjt. Gen. Finnellof Kentucky are here. It is understood that the Kentucky delegation are going to make a dead set on the President to procure the with drawal of the emancipation proclamation. It is believed that their efforts will be fruitless. Washington, Dec. 17. —To-day a highly in fluential delegation of . members of both Houses of Congress, With Vice President Hamlin at their head, waited on the President with a request numerously signed by loyal men of Florida, asking for the appointment of Hon. Eli Thayer as Military Governor of that State, with authority to raise 20,000 loyal emigrants. They also presented to the Presi dent a paper signed by thirty-four members of the Senate and House, earnestly concur ring in the request of the loyal men of Florida, and a paper from Maj. Gen. Hunter, in command or the Department of the South, to the same effect. The Committee was well satisfied with the interview. .

FBOSK t\»LLAA. Tire Secesh Assault on Got* Hlorton. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribane.] Michigan Cm, IntL, Dec. 17,1863. The attack upon Gov. Morton in the Indi anapolis correspondence of the Chicago seccsh organ, is simply infamous. There is not a shadow of evidence to mitigate the atrocious libel. So far from any participation in the al leged frauds in certain contracts, he invited and prosecuted the identical investigation in which they were developed. He will ask at the hands of the next legisla ntre a full investigation of all his official acts. The report made by the Committee of Inves tigation exonerated him In every particular. Xlic Destination of Gen. Banks, New Tore, Dec. 17.—The bark Ann from New Orleans, reports that on the 9th, off St. Augustine, Florida, she saw six steamers bound South—probably a part of Banks’ Ex pedition.

Mr. BINGHAM of Ohio, introduced a bill amendatory to the confiscation acts, so that in all cases pending or which may hereafter arise, ■wherein any ship, vessel, or any other property may be' condemned, the court ren dering judgment, shall, before making the award, first provide for the payment of any bona fide cialma filed by any loyal citizen or friendly foreigner, where proof of claim can be established. Deferred to the Committee on Judiciary. The House then passed the Senate joint res olution instructing the Committee on the Conduct of the War to report thereon with with all convenient epeed- Mr. STEVENS of Pa., from the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a ,bill making appropriations for invalid and other pen sions. Its consideration is postponed until Monday nest. * Mr. STEVENS also reported a bill to sup ply the deficiency in appropriations, for 1563, which was made the special orderfbr Tuesday next.*-, - The House then-wcht-into Committee of ■the Whole on the President’s Message.- - Mr. 

KOELL of Mo. argued that the present organized Democratic party didn’t render an unaißiUiicd support to the war,-but was coc.- tinually throwing obstacles in the way of its prosecution. He undertook to say that it was a delusion to think that this war might have been prevented by the adoption of the Crit tenden compromise. It was true that some of the leaders of the rebellion had voted for that compromise, but the history of subse quent events show that if ten or twelve votes had -been necessary to defeat that measure, they could have been procured. He would go further, and say that there was nothing in the Crittenden compromise that would have prevented the rebellion. The ene mies of the administration held out the idea that the war was not for the restor ation of peace, but for the abolition of slavery, but this was untrue although such might be then-suit. They assert that the Administra tion tramples on the Constitution, and all the rights and privileges under that instrument are to be swept by the board, and that the Uniou is to be contended for without the Con stitution. He had witnessed £bme of these. so called, violations of the Constitution. When war broke out the enemies of the country were not confined to rebel States, but were scattered all over the land- Never was a conspiracy so well concerted- Notwith standing the opinions of Judges Taney aud Story as to the President being guilty of a violation of the Constitution in suspending the privileges of the habeas corpus Mr. Noell justified President Lincoln in doing so. It was his duty to use all means to suppress the rebellion. ” Confiscsitiug rebel property is anotherpretext for making waron the Admin istration. None of the Border Stales who have been trampled in the dust take it as un kind that the enemies of the war expend their sympathies only upon the wives and, children of men engaged In rebellion. * The border States wislUto see retaliation visited on the rebels for their crimes. Again the enemies of this war exhibited a frightful picture of the financial condition of the coun try, but those who got up the rebellion are responsible for every drop of blood, every dollar of extraordinary expenditure, and for all irregularities committed. Mr. Noell pro ceeded to contrast the course of the anti-war party of 1812 with that of the present day, insisting that the parallel was perfect- In this connection he quoted the position of the Federalists of Massachusetts at that time. Jlr. 

THOMAS, of Mass., interrupting, said that if the gentleman from Missouri desired iu any way to give character to the class of men whom both of them condemned, namely, peace Democrats, be could not have pursued a more effectual course, for the old Federal ists of New England were the most honest and patriotic party that- ever lived beneath the throne of God. •> Mr. NOELL resuming, said he started with The proposition that the present or ganized Democratic party was inconsis tent.. "When slavery comes in as an element of Rebel ‘strength and the question is presented between its perpetua tion and the preservation of the Union, then let the former die. He would so act in the suppression of the rebellion that slavery should never produce results similar to those now witnessed- He was against compromise with men who were ‘how endeavoring to -break up the Government. He would agree to nothing but absolute submis sion on their part. He spoke the opinions of the straight out loyal men of the Border States. In conclusion* he advocated emancipation in the border slave States. He stood by the government—by such men as Andrew Johnson. There were but two par ties—one for war, the other for compromise. He wouldn’t lend himself to any scheme to produce strife among the people, to divide the national councils, and weaken and unnerve the arm of the government and strengthen the cause of the enemy. The committee rose, when the resolutions under consideration were reported and agreed to. "They refer various branches of the Presi dent’s annual messagetoappropriate commit tees. The House then adjourned.
