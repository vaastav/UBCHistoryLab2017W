PKEalUOT'li 1CMAGE. The third annual message of President Grant was read in Congress at noon yester day, and is presented to the readers of The Times in fnll this morning. The message basins with the usual and formal vote of thank to Providence for whatever there may be in the history of the past year to be thank ful for. The President then refer to the aeveral reports of the various beads of de partment, and commends thi suggestions therein contained. He review the results Of the labors of the Joi.it High Commission, and recommend that the necessary appro priations be made for carrying out the pro visions of the treaty. On the financial que tion he takes the position foresliadowed a few days ago: Recommends a reduction of ths public expenses to the lowest point, and advises tat the revenue then be reduced to a sum merely sufficient to meet current ex penses and pay the interest on the public debt. His plan of doing this is to abolish all internal taxes except those upon liquor and tobacco, and that derived from iitamps, and to revise and reduce the tariff upon im ports. As predicted a few days ago, he takes a positive position against the policy heretofore pursued by Secretary Boutwell, and protects against any further payment of the piincipal of the public debt for the pres ent. He calls the attention of Congress to fie system of postal telegraphy, now in practice in Great Britain, and very earnestly recommends the adoption of the system in the United States. In his treatment of the currency question he borders upon the nibernisn, and says our paper money should htvenjtrci talue, which should steadily ad mice. One of the uiot impoitant meas ure rtcommerded in the inesi-age, and one that will take the country somewhat by sur prise, is that for a general amnesty. It has been currently reported that the President would not advise an act for the general re moval of disabilities, because, it was said,be considered the legislation already had upon that Fubjvct entirely sufficient But herein rumor was at fault The Executive ex Dresses the conviction that the time has come when all disabilities imposed by the XlVlbsj Amendment fhouM be removed, and says in support of this position, "I do not see the ad vantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely becau-e thty were, before the rebellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elevated to positions requiring them to take an oath to support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining exactly the same views, but ot less standing." This is sound reasoning, is a liberal, humane position, and will meet the approbation of the better class of men of all parties. Another commendable feature is the recommendation of liberal appropriations for the re-building of the Government offices at Chicago. The Civil Service reform is cordially en dorsed, and the President expresses the hope that the committee appointed by him under the act of last .March, will succeed in perfect ing a plan which will reach the desired end The document, as a whole, is comparatively brief. It is a plain and simple statemenfof the condition and relations of the United Sta es, in as few words as possible; its sug gestion are sornd and wholesome, and will be heartily endorsed by the people of the eountrr. Woman SaBrace. Miss fcusan B. Anthony, the renowned advocate of universal mrJrage, lectured in 01mpia Hall, on Tuesday evening, upon the une great ot ject of her life the.enfran cnieuHnt of women. We had found a high opinion of the abiliiy of the lady and her remarkab e talent as a publ.c speaker, and out exiiectalion. have been more than real ized. She presents her arguments in grace ful and elegant language, her illustrations are ample and well chosen, rnd the bearer is irresisiably drawn to the conclusions which cbe seeks to inculcate. Sbe cited the in adequacy of the wages and aaltriea paid to women, as a result of her disfranchise meut, and illustrated by the history of the Trades Unions, ard the "strikes" which result when capital bears with too remorse less a tread upon labor. Those inaugu rate! by men had generally been sue ceaeful, for men with their votes were enabled to control the politicians, and the politicians, by the same means, could ron trol the capitalists. With women, however, the cae was different. When they required an increase of the niierab!e pittance v hi. h constitutes "woman's wages," or a reduction of the number of hours constituting a day's labor, they were met with a prompt relusal; and experience had proven that "strikes" were of no avail, for without the potent charm of the lallot, the employers found but little opposition to their plan of starving the employees into a compliance wun me old rale; or probably, a further reduction, or Hill more onerous burden' ere imposed, to poni-h mkIi prKiiuipti"n. In the higher branches of labor, requiring siiecial know. ec'ge or t-Uill, the salaries paid to men was alwavs iiiglier than those paid to women, for the same services, performed with equal precison and fidelity. She cited a casein which the authorities in one of our metropolitan cities advertised for principals for the common echools, in response to which 'several annlications were made br women, who were refused the positions al though amply qualified to discharge the du ties itupiy because tney were women; and another instance wherein the salaries of a number of lady teachers were reduced. though already lower than those of the male iiut it excited no comment, for the authori ty was held by a nun. even if he did avail himself of a woman's brains to extricate himself from a dilemma. He could vote and exercise influence at ward meetinrs. and tkis covered all the defects of intellect or education. She referred to the condition of be negro before the ballot was eiven to him. as the most universally condemned and de spised of all raws and. conditjowof Men. and note how p'.iint had become the hinges of the knee of the rolitidans now, whenever he asserted his "rights."- It"c6uld"have oat this eaect if riven to woman. There is no denting the sound logic of these arguments.- They appeal to a sense of right and justice which cannot be longer denied. In expressing this opinion ana it is do new. position for ns-we are aware we invite critictm,' bst we haveriesatved to meet and answer all arguments against the proposition with candor and cant-stnesi, to' tbebestofcurabihty. It must be understood this is as an individual, and not a a party journalist. It is' a question' upon which Democrats aa well as Republicana may hon ejtly differ. We do not depart in-the least from the principles we chcish and have so long advocated, aotufo jwa. intend to 4o so.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Tutht Srnai' and Iiciuc I2e,rreTaitaUcaz In addressing my third annual uirrhigr to the Isw-makii g branch of Government, it l gratifying lube able to state that during the past vearucociw has generally attended ibe ifTart to exetute the law found ujon the statute books. Tne policy ha been not to enquire into the wisdom of thehws already enacted, oatto learn 'their spirit and intent and entorce tbem accordingly. A 

YEAS OF PROSPERITY The past year has, under a wi-e Provi dence, been one of prost erity to the nation. Il ha, however, been attended with more than usual chastisements in the lo of life and property, by storm anJ fire. Tho? dis asters have served to call forth the be-t ele ments of human nature in our country, and to develop a friend-hip for us, on the part of foreign nations, which re far towards alleviating the distress cccasioned by the calamities. The benevolent who have o generously shared their means with the victims of these misfor tunes will reap their reward in the conscious ness of having performed a noble act, iyi'1 in receivinz the grateful thanks of men, women and children whose sufferings they have re lieved. The year has been an eventful ore in wit nessing two great nation, ppeakins one lan guage, and having one lintage, etllius, by arbitration, disputes of long standing, and liable, at any lime, to brin tha-e nation into bloody and hostile conflicts. An example lias thus been set which, if r-uccfs-slul in its i-ssue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final mean of returning to productive industry million of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nitions by the baonet and broad-.ord. I trans mit herewith, a copy of the treaty alluded to, which ha been concluded since the ad journment eif Congress with Her Dritannic Majty, and a copy of the protocol of the conferences of the Commissioner, by whom it was negotiated. TltE TREATY WTTII GREAT BRITAIN". This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending tetweer the two na tion9. Various questions a re to bp ailjus'ed by arbitration. I recommend Congress, at an early day, to make the necessaiy provision for the Tribunal at Geneva, and for the sev eral commissions on the part of the United State", c lied for by the treaty. vIIis Msje-ly, the King of Italy, the President of the Swix Confederation, and Hi Majesty, the Em perorof Brazil, have each consented on the loint, or the joint request of the two Poei to name an arbitrator for the Tribunal at Ge neva. I have caused my thanks in be suit ably expressed for thereidine&s with which the joint request has been complied with, by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to thene important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint reque-t of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the arbitrtor of the disputed water boundarv between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard, as be tween tl.'eairelve", certain principles of pub lic law for which the United States has con tended 'rom the commencement of their his tory. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge ot the other maritime powers, and to invite them to accede to them. Xtgotialions are now going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be extended to the powers. 1 recommend the legislation neces sary to bring into operation articles of the treaty relating to the fi-hcrie", and to the other matters touching the relations of the United Suites toaard the British North American Possession", to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall be held on the partof Great Britain and her Posses sions. It is mucti to be desired mat inn iea islation may become operative beiore the fishermen of the United Slates beginto make their arrangements for the coming season. I have" addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wis conin, urging uprn'the govcromentsof these States respectively, the necosary action ou their part to carry into effect theolject of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the canals on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary, in terms of equity, liy the inhabiL-ints of both countries. It is h"oed that the importance of the ol ject and the benefit to flow therefrom, will secure the sieedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. 1 renew the recommendation for an appro priation fordelerminins the true position ot the49 h parallel of latitude, where it firms theboundary between the United States and the British Xorth American Possession between the Lake of the Wood. and the summit of the Kocky Mountains The early action of congress in this recom mendation named, would put iu the power of the"War Department to place a force in the field durinir the next summer. The re- sump ion of diplomatic relations lietween trance and Uermany have enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the pro lection extended to Germans in Franre by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add, that the delicate duty ot this pro tection has been performed by the Minister and the Consul General, at Paris, and the various consuls in Irtnce, under the super vision of the latter, with great kiudi.es", a well as with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German government, and has wound ed no susceptibility of the French. The government of the Empire of Ger many continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United Stales, ai d a desire to harmonize with the moderate andjut policy which thi Government main tains in its relations with Asiatic jniwers as well as with the South American Kepulir. I have given assurance that the frieudly feeling of that government are lully shauti by the United State. The ra'ification of TUE COXSl'UB AND 

XA1UBAL1ZATI0S CON JJICTI0N8. with the Austrian-Hungary Empire have been exchanged. I have Uen ofhciaily in formed of the annexation o: the State of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy and the te- moval of the Calal of that Kinilcm to Home. In uniformity with the established iolicy of the United States I have recognized this chance. The ratification of the new Treaty of Commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged lhe two powers have agreed in their treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two powers; the United States have spared no opKrtiimiv of incorporating thi rule into the obligations of nations. The Forty-first Congress in it third se siun, made an appropriation for the organization of a mixed Commis sion lor adjudicating upon claims of the citizens ot the United Mate rgiin-t Spain growing out of the in-urrection in Cuba. Thai Commission has sin.c been organized. I transmit, herewith-, the cor respondence in relation to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this Commission will afford the claimants a com plete remedy for their injuries. COJJFEREXC AT WASHISCTOK. Il has been made the agreeab'e du'y of the United Slates to preside over a conference at Washington between the Plenipotentiary of Spain and the allied South American Republics, which has resulted in an ariui-tice with the reasonable assurance of a perma nent peace. OUR REUOTOXS tVTnt BC5SIA. The intimate, friendly relations which have o lonjt existed between the United States and Russia centime unintcrrup.ed. The visit of the son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his government to diminish the cordiality of ueaa reunions, ane ..ospitaoie reception given to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that govern- menu -The inexcusable coarse taken by the- Kasian Miniterat Washirgton, rendered it necessary to ask his recall and to decline to accept that functionary as a diplomatic representative. iLwas impossible with self-1 rasped, or wuh just regard to the dignity ot the country to permit Mr. Catscary to continue to hold intercourse with this Government after his at ue of government "officials, and during his per sisttw interference through various means with the relations between the United States and other Powers.- In accordance with my wishes -this Government has been relieved of .fcujhwAiiifeamswwkh Mr. CaUcazy, anr the management oltheafiaira of thejmiierial Legation has pasted into the hand of a cm- tlemaa eatirtly irnnhjwilnsuhli aviTnjAPAS i V.V rrntinue to maintain intima'e relations. ,The Cabinet of the Mikido has, since the la-t t--ion of Consress, -elecl citizens of the bniteil filaie to rve in ouices 01 imior lance in several depaitmen's of their Gov ernment. 1 iimerei-On to UiinK that tins selection Is due to an appreciation of the dis interestedness of the policy whicli the United States have pursued towards Japsn. It is our desire to continue this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition ou the part of the Government to swerve from its established coure, prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our ship wrecked sailors on the 

COREAX COAST. I instructed our Minister, at Pekin, to en deavor to conclude a convention with Corea for Et-curing the safety and humane reat menf of such mariners. Admiral Rogers wa instructed to accompany him, with i sufficient force to protect him in case of n' ed. A small surveying party, sent out, on reach ing the coa't, was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity wa civen for explanation and awlogy for the insult. Neither came A force was then landed, and, after an arduous march over a rilled and difficult country, the forts, from which the outrage had been committed, were gallantly assaulted and were destroyed. II iving thu punished the criminals, and having vindicated the bnnot o( the flis, the expedition returned. Finding it impractic able, under the circumstances, to conclude the de-ired convention, I re-pectfully refer to the earrespandence r htin-thereto, here with Hibmitted, and leave the subject for such action a C mgres.-. may see fit to take. THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO ha not yet repealed the very oljectionable law esta dishing what is known as the free z jne en the frontier of the United States. It I- hoped that this may yet be done, and also that uiote stringent measures miy be taken by that republic for restraining lawless per--ons on iu frontiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve this government of the difficulties experienced from the-e caues. CENTRA. ASD SOUTH AMERICA. Ojr relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue, with one exception, to be c.rdial and-friendly. I recommend some action by Congress regard ing the over-due installments underline aw ird of the Venezuela Claims G.mmission, of lfeG'S. The internal dissensions of the government present no justification for the absence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obli ation. The ratification of an extradi l on treaty with Nicaragua has been ex changed. BtllZII. AND THE 

ABOLITION OP SLAVERY. It is a sul ject for congratulation that the artat Empire of Brazil has taken the initia tory stei toward the abolition of slavery. Our relation with this Empire Is always cor dial, and will naturally be made more so by th:s act. It is not too much to hope that the got eminent of Brazil may hereafter find it lorito intiiest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance more rapidly toward entire emancipation than the present contemplates. The tr.ie pro-perity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the elevation and education of its laborer-. It Isja subject of regret that ru'orui in this direction which were volun tarily promised by the statesmen of Spain h ive not been carr ed out in its West Indian colot.ie. Tiie laws and regulations for the abolition of slavery in Cula and Porto Rico, leave most of the laborers in bondag", with! no hope or release until their lives become a burden to their etnplovers. I de-ire to call your attention to the fact that the citizens of the United states are 

LARGE IIOLDFR3 IN FOREIGN LANDS Of this species of property, forbidden by the fundamental law ot their adopted country. I recommend to Congress tojiro vide, by a stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, or owning, or dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave propei ty in foreign land, either as owners, hirers or mortgagers by persons of the Uni ted Stales. THE DISTURBANCES IN CUBA. It is to be regretted that the disturbed con dition tif the Island of Cuba continues to be a soiirccof annoyance and of anxiety, lhe exi-tci ce of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, with out apirarent prospect of an early termina tion, cannot be other than an object of con cern to a people, who, while abstaining from the a Hairs of other jwiwers, naturally desire to 8M every country in the undisturbed en joyment ol peace, liberty, and the blessings ot free institutions. Our nival commanders in Cuban wa ers have been instructed, in esse it should becme necessary, to spare no eflort to protect the live and property of boni-fide American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain, growing out of the affairs of Cuba, may be adjusted to the spirit of iasa and consolation which has hitherto guided the two powers in the treat mt nt of such que-tions. To give importance and add to the efficien cy of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, ami to further in retaining the good opinions of those people, and to secure to the United ta'e2it share of the commerce des tined to flow between these nations and the balanreot the commercial world, I earnestly recommend an appropriation to be made to s'lppott at least tour American youths in ech of those countries'o a rve as a part of the official family of our .Mini-ters. Then our representatives would not even be placed upon un equality with the representatives ol Great Britain and smaller Powers. As now situated cur representatives in Japan and China have to", depend for interpreters and translation upon the natives of these coun ting, who know our language imperfectly, or procure fur the occasion the services of employee in foreign bus nes houses, or the interpretations to other foreign Min ister. 1 would al-o recommend lib eral measures for the purpose of parting the American lines of steamers now plying between San Francico and Japan and the Australian lines, almost our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. TIIE NATIONAL DEBT has been reduced to the extent of SS0.057, lti.SO during the year, -nd by the negotia tion of national bonds at a lower rate of in ter st, the interest of the national debt has been so far diminised that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly 517, OOO.OCO less than the 1st of March, 1B&J. It was highly desirable that this great dimunition should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country -and convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bank rupting them. But in view of the accomp lis,nicM of these desirable ends of the rapid development of the resources of the country, its increasing ability to meet large demands and the amount already paid, it is net desirable that the present re sources ot tue country snouia continue to be taxed in order to continue thi rapid pay ment. I therefore recommend a modification of botn taxifl add internal tax laws. 

INTERNAL REVENUE. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those of spirit uous, vinous and malt liquors and tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps. TUE TARIFF. In reafius ing the tariff, I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the present laws, after providing the current expenses of the. Government, the interest account and assign ing lund. and that the surplus be reduced in such a manner as to aflord the greatest relief to the greatest number. '1 here are many articles not produced at home, such as medi- cir.e, compounded essences, from which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recom mend to be placed on the fiee list; and should a farther reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made in those articles .which it can be done. without disturbing home production or reducing the wages' of American labor. I have not entered into figures, because to do so, would -be-to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws fur collecting revenue, par collectors crt customs small salaries, out provMe-ler Nsares in all seizures, which, at principal porta of ent'y, particularly raise the compensation of the tfficials to large sums. It has always seemed to me that this system must at times work pereniciouslr.

If the ques t ion can Le met so as to get a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uni formly approaching par with specie, a very desirable ol ject will be gained. THI ARMY. .For the operations of the army during the past year, and for continuing sea coast and other improvements, continued under the supervision of the War Department, 1 refer you toj accompanying report of the Secretary cf War. I call your attention to the provis ion of the act of" Congress, approved March 3. 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the army, until provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in each grade of lhe staff corps be nxed, and that wherever the number in any one grade falls below tbe number so sfixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the offi.e of the chief ot a corps be comes vacant, ibe place mn-t be re-filled by selection from the corin in which the vacancy ex.sts. THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Savy show n improvement in the number and efficiency of the nival force, without mate rial increase iif the expense of supporting it. Praise is due to the olicy which has been adopted and universally used. Our material will admit of using smaller ve-c-ls as cruisers on the smaller station. By these mean we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit mure Irtutitntlv the itort where the prcence of our Hag is desirable, and geneially to dis charge officially the appropriate duties of the navy in' lime of peice without exceeding the number of torn or the expenditures author ized by law. Durini: the past year this navy ha, in addition to Us regul-ir servire, sup plied men and officers lor the vessel of the coa-t survey, and ha1! completed the surveys. a authorized by Congress-, of the Isthmus of Danen and Isthmus ! lebaiintepec, and under this authority, has sent an expedition completely furnished and equipped, to ex plore tbe unknown ocean of the North. i he suggestion of the report an to the ne cessity for increasing and improving the ma terial of the navy, and the plan recommend ed for reducing lhe personnel of the servitv to a uetre standard bv the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine are well considered, and dterve the thoughtful oper ation of Co greys. I al o recommend that all promotion in the navy alove captain should le by selection intead of seniority. This course'will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency, ami hold out incentives to young officer to improve them elves in the knowledge of their profession. THE PBISENT COsT OF MAINTAINING THE NAVY, its cost copartd with that of the proceeding year, and the estimate for the ensuing year, are contained in the secomtranying report of the Secretary of the Navy. rOSTAL AFFAIRS. The enlarged receip's of tne Ptoffice De partment, assbown by the accompanying re port ol the Postmaster General, exhibits a eratifyini; increase in that branch of the pub lic service. It is the index of the growth of educition and the prosperity o! the people, two elements highly conducive to tbe vinor and stability of a Republic. With a vat terri tory like our, much of it sparsely popula ted, but II requiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this Deturtmeiit can be made self-sustaining, but a gradual approach to this end, fiom year to year, is confidently relied on, and the a ay is not far d slant when the Postoffice De pigment of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it H now. 

TOSTAL TELIGRAPII. The suggestions of the Po.mas!t,r-General for improvements in the Department presi ded over by him, are earnestly recommended to your special attention, especially the doc uments favorable to a consideration of a plan for uniting thetelegraphsy-tcm of lhe United States with (he o-ial s)stein. It is believed that by ruth a course the cost of telegraph ing would be nn:ch reduced, and the service as well, it nit better, rendered. It would secure the further advantage, by extending the telegraph through portions ol the country where private enterprise will n it construct it. Commerce and trade, and above all, the eflorts to bring a people, widely separated, into a community ol interests, are always benefited by a rapid inter-communication. Education, the ground-work of Republican institutions, is encouraged by increasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of tbe count ry. Thettesire to reap the bene fits of Mich improvements will stimulate edu cation. I refer you to the report of the Postuiaster-Genend for full details of the operation of last year and for comparative statementsof the re-ult with former years. t THE KC1U.UX. Tiierehas'beeii imposed ujkju the Execu tive branch of the Government the execution oflheactol Congress approved April 20th, 1S71, and commonly known as the "Ku-klux Law", in a portion of IheStateof Sjuth Car olina. , The necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the Comiuittcft to investigate Southern outrages. Under the, provisions of tbe above act, I issued a proclamation cillingthe attention of the people of tt-.e United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case of imperative neces sity, but making known my purpose to en force such powers wherever it should become necessary to do so, for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States, the peace fid enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the, Constitution and the laws. After the passage of this law, information was received from time to time that cui. fili ations of the character referred to in this law existed and were powerful in many p-rl of the Southern States, particularly in certain counties of lhe State of South Carolina. Careful investigation was made, and it was .ascertained that in nine counties of that State such combinations were acive and powerfrl, embracing sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authntitiis, and having among other things the object of de priving tl e cmanciiated class of the substan tial benefits of freedom, and of preventing the free, political action of those citizen who did not sympathize with their own views Among their operation, were frequent sc urgingsanddaionalassassinations,gene- rally perpetrated at night by disguised per sons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different political sentiment from their own, or ersons who had shown a dis position to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of ir offensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless violence. hereupon, on the 13th ofOetobrr, 1871, a proclamation was issued irYnhe terms of the- law, calling upon the members ol the combinations to disperse within five days, and to deliver to the mar shal or military officers of the United States, all arms and ammunition, uniforms, dis guise and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlaw ul purposes. This warning, not having been heeded, on the 17th of October, another proclamation was issued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that State. Direction was given that witlrin the counties designated per sons supposed, upon creditable information to be numbers of such unlawful combina tion, nboold be arrested -by the-militarv au thorities of the United States and delivered to the Marshal, to be dealt with according to law. In two of the Slid counties. York and Spartansburg, many arrets have been made, and at lastaccoucts the number of persona thus arrested was 163. .Several hundred whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree were released for tbe present, Tsms have generally made coufessiomof their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no inno cent person, is-now in cusiady. . The prison ers will be held for trial, in July, at tiibu ah ot the Uaixd JStates.'i.As soon a it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures no trrorelaw Marry perwra'hrttaBled, and there is good grounds lor supposing that all such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this raw-on!! be submitted lo Congress by the At- LtanmOnir .

It maybe advisable for Congress to cocsider what, in the execut'on of the laws against Polygamy, is to be the status of plural wive and their offspring. The propriety of Congress passing an en abling ct authorizing the Territorial Legis lature of Utah to legitimatize all born prior to a time fixed in the act, might be justified by its humanity to these innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recom mendation. INDIAN AFFAIRS. The policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably, so far as can be judged from the limited time in which it ha been in operation. Through the exertions ol the various societies of christians 'who have been entrusted with the execution of this policy, and the Board of Commissioners authorized by the law of April 10, 1SC9, many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservation, to cultivate the soil and perform productive labor of various kind, and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared lor in such a way, it is hoped, as t" induce thoe still pursuing their old habits of life lo embrace the only oppor tunity which is left them to avoid extermina tion. I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy, not only because it is humane, christian like and eco nomical; but because it is right. I recom mend to your favorable consideration, also, the policy of granting a territorial govern ment to the Indian of the Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In doing so, every right guaranteed to the Indians by treaty should be secured. Such a course might be tin mean of collecting most of the Indians between the Missouri and the Pacific and south of the British Possessions into one Territory or one St-d. Tiie Secretary of the Interior has treated on this sut ject at Iei.glh," and I renew my recnmruendalionn that the public land be regarded a a heritage to our children, to he disosed of only a required for occupation and to actual settlers; those already granted have been in great part dis posed of in sikIi a way as lo secure access to ibe balance by lhe hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them, but caution should he exercised in attaining so desirable an object. EDUCATIONAL INTERESTS may well b served by the grant of proceed of sale of public lauds to settlers. I do nut wish to le under-tood a recnmmendirg in the least degree a curtailment of what is being d -tie by the general uovernment for the encouragement of educition. The re on of the Secretary of the Interior, submitted with this, will give you information collected and prepare ' or publication in regard to the census taken during the year 1871, the oiier ationsofthe Bureau of Education for the year, the Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land Office, and the Indian Bureau. THE REPORT OF TIIE COMMISSIONER OF AGRICULTURE gives the oH-raticn ot his Department for the year. As agriculture is the ground work of our prnserily, too much imiortance can not be attached to the labor of this Depart ment. It i in the bands of an able heul with able assistants, all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural production of the n ition all ueful products adapted to any of the various climates of our vast ter ritory, and to giving all uselul information as to the uiode of cultivating the plants, cerials, and other products adapted lo par ticular localities. Quietly, but stireh, the Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good, and liberally supported the more widely its influence will lie extended, and the less dependent we shall 1 e upon ibe the products of foreign countries. SMALL COMPENSATIONS. The subject nt compensation to the head oftursaus and official hoMin osiiionB ot responsibility and requiring ability ami character to fill property, is on lo which our attention is invited. Biit few of lhe officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family; while their duties are sjrh as to involve millions of in terest. In private life, services demand composition equ il to tin- services lei dired A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the government service. I h ive not given the estimates for the support if government for the ensuing yearnor the compilative statement Lelween the expenditures for the year just passed and the one just pr. ceding, because all the-e figuirs are contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly t Congress, i'hese- estimates have my approval. TUE FOUTEENTU AMENDMENT. More than six years having elapsed siht-e the last hostile gun was fired brtwseu the armies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpetuation, the other for the des truction of the Union, it may well be consid ered whether it is not now time that the lis abilitiis imposed by tbe Fourteehth Amend ment should be removed. That amendment dors nut exclude the ballot, but only requires the disability to hold office of certain class?, and when the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to select officeis reflnting the views of the majority. I do not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were, before the rebellion, of standing and character suffi cient to be elected to positions r.qnir ing them to lake an oatb to support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining exactly the same view but of less standing. In their communica tion it may lie said the former violated an oatn, while the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their power to do so. It they had taken this oath, it cannot be doubted but they would have broken it as did the former clans. Il there are any great criminals, distinguished above all others dtsignated, for the part tbey took in op position to ihe Government, they might, in the judgement of Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty. This subject is sub mitted foryourcareful consideration. The condition of the Southern States is, unhap pily, not such a all true patriotic eitizens would like lo see. Social ostracism, for opinion's sake, personal violence or threats towards person entertaining tiolitical views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizen, prevents immigration and the flow of much needed capital into the States lately in rebellion. Il will be a hap py condition ol the country when theold citizens of these States will take an interest in public affairs, promulgate ideas, honestly entertainei, vote for men representing their views, and permit tbe same freedom of expression and tbe ballot inthoe entertain ing different political convictions under the provisions of the act of Congress, sppro.ed February rlst, 1871. A TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT was organized in the District o' Columbia. Its results have thus far fully realized the expecta ions of its 'advocates. Under the direction of tbe Territorial officers a system of improvements has' been inaugurated by means ofwhich Washington is rapidly be comiug a city worthy of the nation's capital, the citizens of the District having voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of contributing to the advancement of the seat of government. AaSISTAVCC FOR CHICAGO. I recommend liberal appmpriations on the part of Congress, in order that the Govern ment may bear its jut shaieof tbe exte-as of carrying outa judicious system of improve ments. By tbe great fire in Chicago tbe most imtortsnt ol tue uove-nuunt tuild- ings in thst city were consumed. Those burned had alieady become in idequate lo the wants of the Government in that growing city, and, looking to the near future, were "totally inadequate. 1 recommend, therefore, that an appropriation! made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square on which tbe burned buildings stood, provided it can be puicHased at a lair valuatica, and provided the Legislature of Illinois will pass a law authorizing it condemnatian tor Gov ernment purposes, and also for the appro priation ot as much money as can properly be expended towards the erection of new buildings. rMTOSTTltKfS CM EOCGRAXTS.

DtSlloMST OFFICIALS It ha been the aim of il,e Administration lo entorce honesty and efficiency in all public offices. Every public servant who has vio lated the trust placed in him has been pro ceed, d gaint with all the vigor of tbe law. ii Dad men nave secured places, it has been the fault of tbe system established by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of those who recommended for govern ment positions persons not sufficiently well known to them personally, or who give let ters endorsing Ihr character of office, seeker without proper sense of the grave responsibil ity which such a couise devolves upon them. A CIVIL SERVICE REFORN, Which can correct this abuse, is much de sired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter ot recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger is renamed as morally reponsi- oieiorine integrity nt hi mend and hi' ability to mee t ii ol I x-i oa? A re'brma tory law which would enfoice this principle again! an treuentiau ot person for p jlic place, would insure great caution in making recommendation'. A saluury le-wn has bee., taught the careless and the dishonest servant in the great num ber o' -osecutions and convictions of thsj last t ears. It is gratitVing lo notice tbe fivorab. change whic . is takii g place throughout the country, in bringing lo puni-h -ent those who have proved recreant to the st confided to them, and in elevat ing to t alic offic: none but tboae who pos sess the infiJence of the honest and virtuous, who, it ill always be found, comprise the insjoritt of the community in which they live. In my message to Congress, one year ao, I urgently recommended a reform in the civil set vicaof tbe country; in eorUbr tally, with that n commendation. CoDttres. in the 9:h section of an act making appropriation for undry civil expenses of lhe Govern ment, and for other pdrpo,- approved March 3d, 1871, gave the neoesary autho rity lo the executive to inaugurate civil service reform, and plared upon him the re sponsibility of doing so. Under thesuthority ot said law I convened a .board of gentle; men eminently qualified for the work, lode-i-e rules and regulation' lo effect the needed reform. Their labors aie not yet complete, but it i believed Ihey will succeed in devja ina plan which can adapted to the t se of lhe executives, lhe heads of departments and members of Congress, and which will re-ound to the true interest of the public ser vice; at all event the experiment shall have a fair trial. I have thus hastily ummed up the oper ations of the government durini: lhe past yrar, and ma e such suggestions a occur to me to be proter lor your consideration, and I submit them with u confidence that your action will be wi-e, statesmanlike, and in tbe best interests ot the whole county.
