I couldn't straighten up on account of the sharp pains that caught me in tlip small of my back and I didn't rest well «t night. 1 often got up in the morn ing tired and lanquid. I couldn't get. relief no matter what I did. I began taking Doan's Kidney pills and the pain in my back eased up and I could rest much better at night. Pretty soon could get around all right and it only took one box ol Doan s Kid ney Pills to tlx me up. J haven'tj had « return of the trouble. Price bOc, at all dealers.
