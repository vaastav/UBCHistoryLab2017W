WASHINGTON, Deeomber 9. Mrs. Carollnu Bllekle of Allegheny, Pa., has written to President Roosevelt asking Ills assistance in securing what she alleges Is due liar from a fortune of 4100,000 or more left by an uncle, Charlos Brenlg, who wont to Hawaii In 1S60 under the name of Simeon Welbort. She alienee that the will under which Samuel M. Damon, formerly a member of President Dole's cabinet, Is made hlef beneficiary waB forged. The above dispatch tells of a new move by a relative of a man whose es tate wus contested heie, and has been the subject of correspondence at various Intervals for many years. The estate consisted of real estate valued at $35, S00 and oersnnul nronerty worth $10,700. All but $1,000 was left by the deceased to S. M. Damon. rjrenlc died In San Francisco. In Sep tember, lb88. He had lived in Honolulu, for a number or years anu nau pros pered In business, making a comfort uble fortune. He went to San Fran cisco for the benellt of his health. The will was filed on October C, 1S88. It had been drawn for the deceased by Shnford IS. Dole, the present governor, when he was a practicing attorney. Dole was named as executor and the will left $1,000 to E. I'. Adams and all the rest to Damon, expressly excluding all relatives, except Brenlg's wife, who could not be wholly disinherited under the Hawaiian law. The will had been signed on April 23, 1877. with Arthur W. Itlcharduon and Yung Atung as wit nesses. The widow, a Hawaiian woman, and one S. Mukui, son of a relative, filed contests of the will, claiming that the deceased had been of unsound mind when It was made. Evidence was taken and the contest was overruled. The contestants asked for an appeal to a Jury which was denied, and the Supre me court, by Chief Justice Judd and Justices McCully, I'roston and Blcker ton, sustained the lower court. S. B. Dole did not sit in the case on account of his having been named as executor of the will. Eastern relatives were next heard from with objections to the will. The woman who has now appealed to Presi dent Roosevelt wrote to Governor Dole In July, 1891, asking him to help her to get what she claimed was her share of the estate. She declared tat she Had been writing to Damon and could nt get any answers. She wns needy and wanted to know if the governor could not get her enough to build a home for herself and nhlldren. The reply to the letter was by Henry Smith, clerk of the courts. It Informed the woman of what had taken place, and of the unquestion able genuineness of the will that hud been probated. The records show clear proor tliat Brenlg made tne will and that he was sane when he did so. The charge that the will was a for gery was made on a copy of a letter al leged to have been written by Brenlg to Jannatta Wlebert, In August, 1880. In this letter were complaints that the writer's letters had not been answered and the statement that he had made a will leaving half his fortune to two nieces, the woman who Is still after the estate being one of them, und the rest to his brother anu his native wife. On tho bottom of this copy.of a letter was u statement that the will filed was a forgery. The case has long since passed Into history as far us the Hawaiian courts are concerned. The Supreme courts decision Is contained In the Hawaiian reports, and the papers are on file among the court records of over 15 years ago.

December 16 A dUpatch to the Minneapolis Times from Washington says: The President lc using foot Hall methods In advancing the Cuban Interests In Congress. The Im pact of the Executive rush line hoc been so strong that Congress is yield ing more ground. Governor Bliss of Michigan, who came here mainly to look after the sugar beet Interests of the people of his State, was Informed by a member of the Senate Committee on Cuban Relations that It probably would be better to seek a compromise rather than to Insist uikhi the high Dlngley rate on Cuban sugars. He was advised that probably the beet-sugar men would not be materially affected if the Cuban sugar was admitted at SO per cent, reduction from the present tariff. This was an intimation of a decided change of front on the irt of Jhe leaders in congress. The suggestion or the itepubllcan Senator to the Michigan Governor may be accented ns reflecting the majority of sentiment on tne Cuban Relations Committee. and Indicating what Is going on in the minus or the small group of the Ken ate which does things. This Is the first dent the President has made on the Senate. Unquestionably the early disposition of the Republican leaders' was to permit the "handmaiden of prospeilty" lay no violent hands on Cuba. The cry was to leave well enough alone. 

WASHINGTON December iv. The beet-sugar men in their annual meeet Ing today discussed the question of reciprocity with Cuba and general matters concerning the tariff, and ar rived at the conclusion that a general campaign of education would have to be entered upon to show Congress that the tariff on beet sugar must not be reduced. Henry T. Oxnard of Cali fornia was elected president of the association, W. L. Churchill of Michi gan vice-president, and Julius Strogh of Michigan treasurer. The fact that the Ways and Means Committee in the House today re ported a bill imposing the Dlngley tariff on goods from the Philippines encoura ges the beet-sugar men, as they argue that If the Philippines, which are do mestic territory, cannot get a tariff re duction, Cuba cannot.

A spe cial to the Sun from Washington says; The Schley court will probably submit Its findings and opinion to the Secre tary of the Navy tomorrow. Jt Is un derstood that at the meeting today the court approved the written drafts of Its conclusions on all except one point In the precept, .which had not been defi nitely determined. Additional informa tion relating to this point was regarded as necessary. This was secured, and it Is believed the court not only dis posed of the matter, but drafted its conclusions Into a report before ad journing. From all accounts the court's findings and conclusions were put Into writing by Ramsay, the Junior member. The greatest care hus been taken to pre vent the substance or any Information whatever about them from leaking out. It Is even said thut the members of the court agreed not to discuss the case with the members of their own fam ilies. From the little that has leaked out about the methods of the court's procedure, it Is the understanding that the report will not be submitted to a stenographer for copying, but will be laid before the Secretary of the Navy In the handwriting of the member de puted to draft It. thephISTtariff A BILL IS ALREADY UNDER CON SIDERATION.

Sea Was so Rough This Morning That Olllcers Had Greatest Dllllculty in Boarding Nippon Maru. The sea was exceptionally rough out side the harbor this morning. In fact," It loo".: id for a while us if the Nippon Maru could not be brought Inside for the simple reason that the pilot could not board her for a long time. Pilot Lorensen went out In the pilot boat, early this morning to the Nippon Maru as she lay south of the mouth of the channel. So rough was the water however that It was actually danger ous for even the whale boat to venture close to the side df the big vessel. The waves came rolling along the vessel in rapid succession. She was pointing di rectly to the southward. There was no break for the waves as they had prac tically a full sweep and in consequence, tlip small boat was tossed about. . Time und time again did the boat boys bring the boat alongside the big steumshlp, only to have to veer off again to avoid being smashed by the waves against the vessel's side. The pilot got up a number of times to try and seize the Jacob's ladder and climb aboard tho vessel but each time he failed. Finally, he succeeded in ggttlng aboard. Those In the quarantine boat fared little better. In udditlon to Dr. Moore the boarding ollicer. there were Customs Inspectors Jacobsen and Neal. They were taken out In the row boat as tho regular launch wus not sent out. Tho Inspectors In this boat watched the ef forts of the pilot to get aboard and trembled us they regarded their own prospects. Dr. Moore had been used to pretty rough weather at his Alaskan post, so he did not lose much time In getting aboard but he took big chances In doing It. When the quarantine boat was with in a few feet of the ladder and rose on the crest of a ? wave, he took a fly ing leap, caught the ladder and climb ed aboard. Jacobsen and Neal had ul most as dllllcult a time getting uboard us had the pilot. In fact, they thought several times that they could not make It. A short lull In tho seas came how ever, und they succeeded In getting hold of the ladder und climbing aboard the steamship. WASHINGTON. December 9.
