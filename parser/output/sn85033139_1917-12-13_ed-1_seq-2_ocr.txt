'urge raising more wheat j Many Dealers Co-operate to Save White Flour By Inducing Custom ers to Use More Substitutes. Madison The State Council of De fense feels that a good deal is being accomplished in the campaign it is making under the direction of Food Administrator Macnus Swenson, to re duce the amount of wheat which will ho consumed by residents of Wiscon sin. Letters from interior cities of the state and also from Milwaukee indi cate that dealers in flour are pledging themselves to do all they can to get their tusloniers to use substitutes for wheat (lour, it is said that the deal ers in several northern Wisconsin cit ies have practically promised to limit their sales of wheat flour and have stated that if customers attempt to buy large amounts they will tell such customers that a portion of their or der must be filled with some substi tute for wheat. The slate council expects to have figures before January 1 as to the amount ot winter wheat which has been gown in Wisconsin during the fall and these figures will to some ex tent influence the campaign which will be carried on during the winter to secure pledges from farmers to plant a portion of their land to spring wheat next year. The hope is that at least twice the acreage which was planted this year to wheat will be used for wheat next year. It is believed, also that by a careful canvass this object can be ac complished.

SUBSTITUTE FOR FUEL Superior Man Says He Has Perfected Method of Making Fuel Out of Clay Mixed With Sawdust. Superior- A Superior man with an inventive mind, who has already in vented or improved several chemical processes and who la responsible for several devices, says he has perfected a method of manufacturing a fuel out of clay. He is Gustaf Engelbrekt. With eight pounds of the new fuel, two or three pounds of wood and a mutch, Engelbrekt has several times kindled a fire in the presence of local businessmen that developed sleam in a small boiler iti seventeen minuteo. The new fuel depends for its heat producing qualities on the aluminum which is a constituent of all clays. The clay is treated by a chemical pro cess, which is said to be simple, and it is mixed with sawdust, then mold ed. Engelbrekt says that the new fuel can be produced commercially at $6 a ton. Specimens of the ash looked much like coke. RESOURCES MAKE BIG GAIN An Increase of Over $41,000,000 Is Shown By Wisconsin State Banks During Past Year.

Madison —Action to put an end to the killing of doe and fawns in Wis consin may be expected before an other deer hunting season, it was an nounced at the office of the state con servation commission. Commissioner W. K. Barber, head of the game de partment, who has just returned from an extended visit to the northern part of the state, said the killing of deer this season is by far beyond any in the history of the stale. “Conditions have been ideal, with snow just right for tracking and the leaves gone from the trees and underbrush,” he de clared. Out of the immense killing, from sixty to seventy per cent are doe and fawns. This would practically ex terminate deer in Wisconsin. It is ex pected that a hearing of petitions filed, will be held soon and either a closed season announced or a reversion to the "one buck law" will be decided upon.

The commission will establish two new game refuges in the slate, one in Douglas county and another in Barron county, each to consist ot a 5.000-acre tract of wooded land.

ADDS AUSTRIA TO OUR FOES Progress of Russia's Effort* for Ar mistice—Gormans Sacrifice Msn Recklessly in Furious Attacks in France and Italy— American Troops to Be Rushed Across. By EDWARD W. PICKARD. The United States is in the war to the finish—and that finish must he the overthrow of the Prussian military despotism, the liberation and restora tion of the peoples it has enslaved and reparation for the material dam age its armies have done. When this Is assured, the United States will in sist on a peace that Is based on gen erosity and Justice to all alike, ex cluding all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of tlie victors. Mean while Austria-Hungary must tie form ally declared our foe in tlie war. and “our present and Immediate task” is to win that war. Such in a few words Is the message of President Wilson to congress, to America, and especially to tlie world. He leaves no doubt of the govern ment's and tlie nation’s humanitarian alms, and he makes equally plain the determination never to make peace with the present rulers of Germany who have done su< h “deep and abom inable wrong.” The president ex pressly disavows any intention to Im pair or rearrange the Austro-Hunga rian empire, hut says that to tlie Austro Hungarians should he restored independent control of their own af fairs, and avers that the Balkan states and Turkey should be secured against foreign oppression or Injustice. Mr, Wilson's polished diction does not con ceal Ids contempt for the pacifists, the traitors and others who seek to ham per the nation In the prosecution of the war. When everyone else within sound of his voice arose and cheered the president's Impassioned statements, Senator La Follette, Representative Mason and one or two more sulked si lent In (heir seats. They are easily Classified. Message Warmly Approved. Instant approval of Hie message was general throughout tlie United States, and It received the hearty endorse ment of the British and South Ameri can press, though some of Fie London papers, notably tlie Times, are skep tical about the distinction the presi dent still makes between the German rulers and the German people. It must he confessed a great many Americans also feel the German people are not so guiltless ns Mr. Wilson represents them, Gongress lost little time In starting proceedings for formal declaration of war against Austro-Tliingary, and gov ernment agents throughout the coun try at once began preparing to handle the million and a half enemy aliens which It adds to the list. As tens of thousands of Austro-Hungarians have been employed In tlie mines of Amer ica, there is danger of a serious short age of mine labor. It Is likely a good deal of discrimination will be used In dealing with such subjects of the dual monarchy, as (lie Bohemians and vari ous Slavic races, who have no sym pathy with tlie autocracy of their rulers. Bolshevlki Pesc# Efforts. The efforts of the Russian holshe vikl to bring about a general cessation of fighting was not markedly success ful Inst week. Large numbers of Rus sian troops were withdrawn from the front lines, and Austro-Hungary for mnlly approved of the armistice plan: hut when the representatives of the Russians begun discussion of de tails with the Germans they met with a quirk check. Their first two stipu lations were that the enemy should not undertake to send forces from tlie Russian front to the front of Rum sill s allies, and that the German de tuohments should he withdrawn from 

ALLEGE EXCESS WAR PROFITS Worker* in New York State Are Re sentful Because of Condition* Alleged to Exist. Unrest among workers on war con tracts because of the belief that the firms are taking excess profits Is re ported by a federal survey of labor con ditions In New York State. The sur vey finds large numbers of women re placing men, and workers being laid off In nonesseutlal Industrial. the islands of Moon sound. To this the German delegates replied evasive ly, merely promising to consult their government. On Thursday Berlin announced that a suspension of hostilities along the entire Russian front for ten days be ginning Friday noon had been arrang ed. The same dyy Trotzky declared the Russian government want a separate peace. There were reports, which, however, were emphatically denied, that Rou manla desired to open negotiations for an armistice. If their flank on the north were left unprotected by the quitting of the Russians, the Rouman an forces between the Dniester and the Black sea would be in extreme peril. Members of the Red Gross mis sion of Roumanla have just brought to President Wilson a message from King Ferdinand declaring his country would never make a separate peace. Ensign Krylenko is now in control of much of the Russian army, his men having captured the headquarters at Mohilev and murdered General Duk houin. commander in chief. At last reports General Kaledines' Cossacks were marching on Vitebsk and a battle with Krylenko’s forces was Impending. Most of the Russian diplomatic representatives In allied countries and the Russian troops in France have disowned the doings of the bolshevikl leaders and refuse to recognize their authority. Germans Try Hard for Big Victory. It is evident that the German high command is trying desperately to ob tain a decisive military victory In France or Italy, or both, before the American army gets across in suffi cient force to he effective. So far the result achieved by the enemy has been tlie gain of a few rods of ground at an appalll ’ cost in loss of life. The fighting in the Gnmbrai sector devel oped into (he bloodiest and fiercest battle of the war. and despite the bringing up of great numbers of Ger many’s best troops, the British in the main repulsed the repeated mass at tacks and held most of the ground gained the previous week. If Byng can continue to hang on to his posi tions. the battle will prove tbe best thing the British could ask. for It has brought the Germans “out of their holes” and not only shown them tip as inferior In open fighting, but cost (hem an enormous number of their most valuable men. The reckless sac rifices made by Grown Prince Rup precht contrast strangely with the In formation that Germany is training hoys of fifteen and sixteen to take their places soon in the fighting lines. America has cause for pride and satisfaction in the reports that come of the part in the Garabrai fighting taken by American engineers. Gaught by a sudden advance of the Germans, these men took shelter until the Brit ish came up to them, and then, borrow ing guns, went Into the fray with a gallantry and coolness that won high praise from the commanding officers of the British. A few of them were killed and wounded, hut the others went right on with their fighting, pa trolling and railroad building. Fierce Fighting in Italy. Along the Italian front the fighting has been little less fierce than at Gum brul, and as (lie week closed the Aus tro-Oermnns were making their sec ond great offensive there. In the in itial attack by largely increased forces tlie enemy compelled the Italians to withdraw from some advanced posi tions between Monte Tonderecar and Monte Badenecche. but elsewhere the violent assaults were repulsed. If the invaders succeed In that sector In flanking (lie Plnve and Brenta lines, they might force General Diaz hack as far as the Adige. However, tlie Italian commander seemed quite confident he could prevent this, and his forces were gallantly guarding the entire line while Increasing numbers of British and French re enforcements continued to arrive. Among the allies In action on this front are a number of Ameri can aviators, and the declaration of war against Austria-Hungary seems to rnske sure tlie speedy dispatching of a considerable force of American sid dlers to reenforce the Italians. At any rate that is what Italy expects, and the entire country celebrated Joy ously tlie news that Its chief foe was to lie included in the enemies of Hie United States. U. 8. Troops to Be Hurried Over. One of the main subjects discussed in tlie Interallied conference In Paris was tlie best means of getting Ameri can troops to France as rapidly as pos- The survey, which is being made through tile employment agencies of the Department of Labor, bus covered 37 rltles to (lute. It has been found that war order firms employing 168.44 C persons want 23,048 additional work ers. Approximately 57 per cent of the de mand for more laborers came from air plane and seaplane factories. Addi tional workers also are needed by tankers of ordnance and ammunition. Iron and steel eastings, machinery, sci entific Instrument, and optical tmp- slble and supplying them with muni tions and food. To release as much tonnage ns may be for the purpose of carrying the American soldiers an international organization was created that will co-ordinate the utilization of transport facilities, somewhat restrict ing the Imports of the various nations. It may be that ft considerable part of the supplies for the American army will be obtained from England and France In order to save time. The allies intend to bring out their full man power, and the troops of the United States are to be taken to the front os quickly as It can be done. There is no doubt that this Is the plan of the government, despite the opinion of Von Hlndenhnrg and Von Luden dorff that America was raising a great army only to protect Itself against Ja pan and would not be so “foolish" as to send it to Europe. If those gen tlemen read the president’s meesage some glimmer of truth as to the real determination of the United State# may penetrate their skulls. China May Send an Army. Before very long yet another na tional army may be fighting beside the allies in France against Germany. It Is reported that a large force from Chinn is to be brought to the west ern front, probably under the com mand of General Yeng-Chang, chief general adjutant to the Chinese presi dent. For a long lime many thou sands of Chinese have been working behind the lines in France, and doubt less the well-trained and equipped armed forces of the Oriental republic also will be welcome there. From Palestine General Allenby sent word that he was in a position to en ter Jerusalem at any time he saw fit, but was continuing an enveloping movement to the north of- the Holy City. Equally satisfactory Is the news from East Africa, the British com mander there reporting that the last Germans had baen cleared from that vast region. All who were not killed or captured bad fled to Portuguese territory, where they would soon be attended to, he said. Thus Germany has been stripped of the last of her colonies. Interallied Naval Council. An important decision of the coun cil In Paris was to create an Inter allied naval council in order to close contact and complete co-operation be tween the navies of the allies. The council will be composed of the min isters of marine and admiralty chiefs of the nations represented. The war fare on the submarines is proceeding satisfactorily, but the last British ad miralty report shows the toll of the U-Boats is still high. 10 British ves sels of more than 1,600 tons and five others having been sunk In the week. Among the boats torpedoed was the steamer Apnpn, 80 passengers and the crew perishing. The submarine shell ed the vessel's open boats that were filled with women and children. Early Thursday morning a fleet of hlg German airplanes made a raid on England and several of them succeed ed in reaching London. Their bombs killed seven persons. At least two of the raiding machines were brought down by gun fire and their crews cap tured. War Stamps on Sale. The sale of war saving* stamps and certificates, America’s newest plan for raising war funds and encour aging thrift, began on Monday, and was taken up by the entire country with an enthusiasm that presages Its complete success. The campaign will continue for one year, and It Is be lieved the maximum sum authorized — $'j.000,()00,000—will he obtained with out trouble. The interstate commerce commission having recommended the nationaliza tion of the railroads during the contin uation of the war, the president and his aids took up the matter last week, and Mr. Wilson was expected soon to send to congress a special message on the subject. The administration con ceded that the roads must be given liberal financial aid and a plan may ba evolved for their operation under a government dlree*r of transportat’on. The most terrible of the many dis asters Incident to the war befell Hali fax, N S„ on Thursday, when the French munition ship Mont Blanc ex ploded In the harbor after being ram med by a Belgian relief vessel. Some 5.000 persons were killed, many thou sands injured and a considerable part of the city and its suburbs wrecked by the awful blast. plies, knit goods, eleetrlcul apparatus and supplies, chemicals and trucks and motor vehicles. It was round that firms expanding their operating forces and firms laying off employees frequently were In the same industry. Other Industries which are alleged to be curtailing their forces because the public Is buying less of their prod ucts Include factories making fine kid gloves, fancy sweaters, brooms and brushes, typewriters and high-grade woodwork. i:
