THE DICKINSON PRESS BVKBY SATURDAY AT DICKINSON, N. D, -BY L. AYBBS. PMTMr 7Be.for ilz months •trietly la sdvaooe. 1 ttDieldiiaon Fostoaea MMCoadrtu* matter. OFFICIAL PAPBB FOK STARK COUNTY. PRESS TELEPHONES E torial Office ... 148.J Job Room .... 148J Rooseveltisms The wageworkers, the working men, the laboring men of the 'Country, by the way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class hatred have em phasized their sound patriotism •and Americanism. It is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations, as is 'done by the Sherman anti-trust •law, because such a law can be en forced only imperfectly and un equally, and its enforcement works as much hardship as good. Instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all combinations there should be substituted a law whicli shall expressly permit combina tions which are in the interstate commerce commission. It is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear, from wrongdo ers of great wealth. There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor and shortening of hours of mechanical labor. Stock gambling should be pro hibited. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of tak ing care of the wageworkers who, under our present system, become -killed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The generosity of the United States toward its employes com pares most unfavorably with that of every country in Europe—even the poorest. Beginning with the supreme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled. The courts are jeopardized prim arily by the action of those feder al and state judges who show in ability or unwillingness to put a stop to the wrongdoings of very rich men under modern industrial conditions. There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly detrimental to the rights of the wage workers. I again renew my recommenda tion for postal savings banks. The establishment of a local parcels post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and country storekeeper. I advocate the immediate admis sion of New Mexico and Arizona as states. American citizenship should be conferred upon the people of Por to Rico. In Cuba our occupancy will cease in about two months' time. I approve the recommendations of the general board for the in crease of the navy. From President Roosevelt's valedictory message to congress Tuesday. Welcome The Elks and their friends hold undisputed sway in Dickinson.

The Elks are a jdlly bunch of good fellows and Dickinson is proud to wel come them and determined to give them the time of their lives which will cause them to long re member The

GOOD COUGH MEDIC1NEBFOR CHILDREN. The season for coughs and colds is now at hand and toe much care cannot be used to protect the children. A child is much more likely to contract diphther ia or scarlet fever when he has a cold. The quicker you cure his cold the less the risk. Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is the sole reliance of many mothers, and few of those who have tried it are willing to use any other. Mrs. F. FV Starcher, of Ripley, W. Va.. says, "I have never used anything other than Chamberlain's Cough Remedy for my children and it has always given good satisfaction." This remedy contains no opium or other narcotic and may be given as confidently to an adult. For sale by all druggists.

NORTH DAKOTA BAKING POWDER The only baking powder made from Royal Grape Cream of Tartar Made from Crapes 6 Food is more tasteful, healthful and nutri tious when raised with Absolutely PURE At a meeting of the Dickinson school board held Monday evening it was de cided to make the holiday vacation from December 18 to January 4. The teachers will be paid their three weeks' salary next Friday evening. The board also considered the recent meeting of the state board regarding the introduction of domestic science and manual training in 1909. The Dickinson director concur in the opinion that it is a good thing, but will ask the state board to modify its ruling so as to give more time for inaugurating this important work. It will be expensive and very difficult to arrange on short notice. At least two years are needed for the preparatory work such as suitable quarters and com petent instructors.
