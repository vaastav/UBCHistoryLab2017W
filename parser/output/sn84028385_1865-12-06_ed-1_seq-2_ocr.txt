C, emphatically denies that there is any truth in the reports of negro insur rections, or attempts at insurrection, in Barnwell District. It appears that in the Tennessee Leg islature the resolutions remonstrating agsinst the pardon of Jeff Davis and oth ers was amended by adding the names of James Buchannan and John C. Breck inridge to the list declared infamous and worthy of death, on motion of Dr. Keith," who stated that he had been a Democrat and had been deceived by them.

South Carolina, there seems to be no lim it to the outrages committed upon Union soldiers and freedmen in South Carolina. In one month live citizens have iieen ur rested tor killing freedmen iu one district alone, tine officer anil three soUliers were biutally lauidereU, and although a con&iuoral.le number ot citizens were en paced in these assassinations, no clue has been obtained to then- names. Society stems united to protect such characters. In addition to the cases given above one biack buy was found whipped to death, one dead iu a public square, one shot through the head, one with his throat cut, and one came in to the authorities nearly dead from the effects of a brutal whipping. The following is au extract from a pri vate letter, written from Gov. Terry's district ; 

GREENVILLE C. H, Oct. 26, 1865. 1 write to inform you somewhat of the state of affairs in this district. There is a bund ot men oiganized in the lower part of the district, whose purpose seems to be to take the law in their own hands with regard to freedmen. One of them, a desperado, formerly in the tonlederate service, openly boasts that he h;is killed 3S negroes recently. On Monday night last a negro was kill ed S miles below this place, and it seems iinjnissible through tne civil authorities even to obtain u "jury of inquest." The iollowing is an extraol trout the letter of a General now on duly in South Carolina detailing additional cases: S. C, Nov. 9, 1865 In regard to minders and outrages committed on freedmen, 1 have to state the following as having been repotted to me, ami of the truth of which ample ev idence is presented : In the vicinitv ot Columbia, there nave been three cases of murder reported since Nov. 1. and numerous outrages have been perpetrated by whipping and tying up by tha thumbs. In the tipper districts, particularly in Greenville and Union, trustworthy re ports in regard to murders committed have come to my knowledge. There have been ut least three cases of murder of fieedmen within the last month with in twelve or fifteen miles of Greenville. In one as the man was found hanging by the neck, and hiui probably been hang ing there two weeks, the buards having eaten him partly ui. A brother of this ireedrnau was found dead by the 6ide ot the road. There is one pase reported of tifieen hundred lashes havine been g:ren a freedman. Iu Union District there are regularly organized bands who go about the pount ry committing outrages Uon poor tr bites and freedmen. Several other cases have been reported in Newlieiry and Edsefield districts. There have been innumerable instances of whipping mid tying up by the thumb practised uixjn the f'retdmen. It has not been deemed advisable to give names and define localities, as in sev eral cases the outrages are undergoing in vestigation, and theendsof justice might thereby be delayed or hindered.
