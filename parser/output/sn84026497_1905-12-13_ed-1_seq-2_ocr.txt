THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. I. WINK, - COITOII 4 MOPRItTOR. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1905. Tammany election ofllcials stand s good chance of securing state jobs at Sing Sing. What need we care for railroad passes anyway, with automobiles gotting thick er and cheaper every year. Why did the President neglect to com ment on the one great question of the day, the Christmas present question? "At the bottom, the great, mass of the American people are honest," says Mr. Jas. H. Eckels. The demand Is for hon esty at the top. Tiik passage in the President's message onod adulteration vigorously touches on a matter that legislators in this coun try have neglected. President's messages since 1897 have been an unbroken story of national pros perity. On that Horn everybody should bo willing to stand pat. In Korea they pay high honors to pub lic men who commit suicide. In this country we do even better. High honors are paid to men who ought to commit suicide. Secretary Root's recommendation for the removal of eighty-nine American consuls who have been loaling on their Join, Is a blow to political traditions. The man who is "willing to work" for a liv ing seldom seeks a consulship, Thb opposition to the Roosevelt plan for dealing with the transportation ques tion is fast disappearing. Senators are falling into line, the railroad presidents are becoming convinced and the people are getting busy. The anti-free pass order will strike the Chester mem bets of the Legislature with particular severity. They bad already Riven notice that they would not take any pay for the extra session, and now to have to pay railroad fare will put reform to a pretty bard test. "It is greatly lo be wished," says the President's message, "that the state of New York should copy as regards Nia gara what the state of California has done as regards the Yoeemite." California has made the national government the owner of the Yosemite valley. There seems to be no other way to save Niagara Falls. And tbey say that railroad passes will actually be a thing of the past alter the first of the yeir. Ginger blue! How can a poor Congressman or legislator be ex pected to walk clear to Washington or Harrisburg in the dead of winter when chilblains and corns are just at their very worst? Pay fare? That would be hades with the lid off. It is time for the Congress of the Unit ed States to arrange to pay the traveling expenses of future Presidents. The Pennsylvania Railroad has abolished the pass system, so it says, and if the rest of the pollticianare to pay, the President should not be made an exception. And the present salary of the President Is not enough to meet bis expenses while trav eling, if he goes really first-class, accord ing to bis rank. Franklin News. Senator Fox, of Harrisburg, thinks the railroads ought to be required to give passes to Congressmen and members of the Legislature. Why to them any more than to other nlUcials? Are we to under stand that they are in a better position to do something valuable for the railroads in return? The Constitution of Pennsyl vania, which forbids all free passes ex cept to employees of the roads, makes no discrimination in favor of members of the Legislature unless they can be rated as ojnployees. Philadelphia Press. At a recent editorial convention a min ister who, it is not unlikely, was at one time engaged in the newspaper business himself, ottered the following toast: "To save an editor from starvation, take his paper and pay him for it promptly. To save him from bankruptcy, advertise in bis paper liberally. To save him fiorn despair, send him every item of news of which you can get hold. To save him from profanity, write yonr correspond ence plainly on one side of the sheet, and send it in as early as possible. To save him from mistakes, bury him. Dead people are the only ones that never make mistakes. Newspaper readers would do well to remember that there are no per fect people editors or readers." Tim New York Evening Mail thinks it high time to have an effective pure food law. It says: "When hayseed and su gar, colored red witli aniline dyes, are sold for raspberry jam togreaterquantity than the real stuff, when old felt cloth is chopped up, rotted with acids, and sold for mushrooms; when rotten eggs are deodorized with chemicals and sold to bakers to be used in making cake; when spoiled fish, having gone beyond borax, is treated with salts of zinc, aluminum and other metals, and the gills colored with coal tar dyes to give them a fresh look; when boracicacid is sqnirted over chopped beef to "sweeten it" by the butcher under the customer's very eyes when these and countless other unsani tary enormities are daily perpe'rated up on a people who have no defense, the time for drastic legislation on the sub ject of pure food would seem to have arrived." On the day whon Theodore Rooseyelt will retire from the presidency Thomas C. Piatt will retire from the United States senate, and there are present indications that the empire stale will for the succeed ing term thereafter bo honored by the services of Mr. Roosevelt iu the upper house of congress, Among the journals winch have thus early suggested this course In political events is Leslie's Weekly, which says: "If President Roosevelt insists on taking himself out of the presidential field in 1908 and there is no doubt as to the sincerity of his purpose at this time-it will be a Rreat public loss. His remarkable aptitude for meeting the most perplexing national problems justifies the hops that ho will not retire from public life lour yours hence. There is no reason why he should wait till 1912, as has been suggested, and then once more permit his name to be used as a presidential candidate. Let New York send Mr. Roosevelt to the senate as soon as his term ends. When be steps down and out of the presidency on March 4, 1909, Mr. Piatt's term lu the senate will close, aud as be will be 76 years of age at that time he will refuse another election. He already saya this is bis last term. Let President Roosevelt be chosen to succeed Senator Piatt." ANOTHErt 

BANK SCANDAL. President of a New York Securltlet Company Charged With Fraud In Philadelphia. Philadelphia, Dec. 11. Charge with obtaining money under false pre tenses, Merrick E. Vinton, president of the Middlesex Banking and Securl ties company of New York, was held In J2.000 bail for court. He gave cast ball. The charge wag preferred bj John S. Stevens, former president ol the National Builders' association, and a prominent builder and financier ol this city. At the magistrate's hearing, Mr Stevens testified that two years age he was Induced to purchase a gold In stalment bond issued by the company which he yas informed would pay an Interest of 4ft per cent annually. H( paid the first instalment of $1,000, bul when notified that the second Instal ment was due he became eusplcloui and made Inquiries as to the regular Ity of the bond. Vinton, he said, ml represented the facts concerning the bond. Vinton told him the bond was one of an old issue on which $30,000, 000 in interest had been paid. Mr. Stevens said he learned, on the con trary, that the bond Issue was of re cent date and he stated the company defaulted on its payment of Interest. His Information regarding the bond, however, was secured after he had paid the second Instalment of $1,000. 

PENITENTIARY FOR BANKER. Federal Court Sentences Ohio Man Found Guilty of Violating Na tional Banking Laws. Cleveland, O., Dec. 11. Judge Tay lor of the United States district court overruled a motion for a new trial fot O. L. Hayes, president of the Gallon O., National bank, recently found guilty on the charge of violating the national banking laws, and sentenced him to serve 7 years In the Ohio penitentiary, and to pay the cost ol prosecution. The court also overruled a motion for a new trial in the case of Edward Flicklnger, president of the Fllckln ger Wheel company of Gallon, con victed on the charge of aiding and abetting In the misapplication of the funds of the Gallon National bank. Judge Taylor sentenced Flicklnger to serve 7 years In the penitentiary and to pay the cost of prosecution. Notice was served by both defend ants that appeals would be made to the circuit court of appeals. The failure of the Gallon National bank occurred In February of last year.

It was found that the bank carried about $315,000 worth of the paper of the Flicklnger Wneel company, the Wagon and Gear conv pany and the Decatur Buggy company, of which concerns Hayes was a direc tor. Bill Against Capital Punishment Cleveland, Dec. 11. Influenced by the Rogers execution, a bill to discon tinue capital punishment In Ohio will be Introduced In the next legislature by Representative Sawkl. He said that the theory of "an eye for an eye" was obsolete and a relic of barbarism. "The taking of a life by a state is coldblooded," he said, "and sometimes worse than murder, for murder Is of ten committed In a passion when the assailant does not realize the enorm ity of. his action. The population in the state of Ohio ought to take the lead In setting a good example In this mat ter. A life sentence In the peniten tiary Is severe enough punishment for any crime." Murdered by Masked Men. Cleveland, Dec. 11. Patrick Hogan, an employe of a fruit commission merchant, was murdered here Satur day night In a mysterious manner. With a basket of fruit on his arm he was walking along Seneca street, In a factory section of the city known as the "Flats," when two men with masks over their faces suddenly Jumped from behind a building and with lit tle ceremony shot him In the head, killing him Instantly. The police think It was a case of revenge and mistaken Identity. Three Msn Died From Coal Gas. Elizabeth, N. J., Dec. 11. Two men are dead, one Is dying and two others are in a serious condition as the re sult of being overcome by the fumes of coal gas in the tar paper mill of W. H. Rankin. All would probably have perished had It not been for the heroic efforts of a fellow employe of the mill. The dead are: Paul Szyslak and Andrew Chlap. Robert Dowllng Is dying In a hospital.

New Castle, Dcs. 11. An Increase of 5 per cent In wages will be made this month by the Pennsylvania Engineer ing WorkB company, to become effec tive after Dec. 16. Self-esteem is all right, in its way, but it should not be allowed to become so ap parent as to render it obnoxious. 

PUNISHED BY PROMOTION. Carton Lnir Tbnt Prrvallpil In the Florentine Republic. The Florentine republic hail n unique method of denlltig with Its too imlont democrats. In J213 the state passed the famous ".Magna ( harta of Flor ence," to curb the cruelty and rapacity of the lawless nobles, who, In dotlanco of the law courts, wore nccustoined to flog and torture their dependents at will. The act practically disfranchised these titled harpies by a clause which excluded them from the slgnory a body In the state corresponding to the British cabinet unless they renounced their nobility. This curious provision prepared the way for a still more extraordinary clause, which enacted that atiy member of the democratic party who made himself obnoxious to the government and was by tlni declared to bo "guilty of treason to the commonwealth" should be given a patent of nobility aud thus at the same moment be raised In the social scale and reduced to n political nobody nt the will of the state. Lon don Telegraph. The NoorUUInn Chestnut. The London Lancet finds that the chestnut is the most digestible nut nnd cannot only take the place of the pota to, as lu France, where chestnuts, boil ed aud mashed like potatoes, make a delicious dish, but In reality they are a more perfeet form of food. According to the Lancet's analysis of the potato and the chestnut, the latter contains less water, more proteld, more fat and starch, but less mineral matter, than the potato and Is more digestible than the latter. Like the potato, also. Its nutritive and digestive qualities are greatest when baked or roasted. 100 REWARD, 9IOO.
