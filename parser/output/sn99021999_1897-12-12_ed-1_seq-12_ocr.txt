1IAKKH. j Xo lniortnnt | measure linn over been 1 I enaeted by confess without meeting | with frivolous objections. The proposed l > . stal savins * system la.no exception to this rule. The free delivery of letters nnd tht ? postal money order were In augurated In spite of tlie protests of the mossbaek element of the country nnd even the establishment of national hanks was opposed by bankers who now re gard them as the bulwark of our ilnan- clal system. The main objections to postal savings hanks usually focus In two questions : How shall the money deposited be safely Invested ? What will be the effect of establishing postal savings banks on tin ; existing savings bank system ? The llrst question suggests another question , Why has the government never been tioubled with the Inveatment of Ihe money wb'eh ' It borrowed from bankers on interest bearing bonds ? If the government has managed to kocp safe the hundred ) ? of millions ot mom-y borrowed from -capitalists at home nnd abroad on securities drawing from II to 0 per cent Interest without providing for Its * Investment why , should the government bar Itself from borrow ing ; money from the common people who would be Kind to offer their savlnsiit to Its keeping for I/ ! , or even - per cent because there Is no place to Invest the money ? The government has now mini ; than .f. > ( K,000.0X ) ( ) lylnj ; Idle In the treas ury and yet nobody In or out of congress has yet proixwed to Invest any part of it at Interest. The most liberal estimate of the iniixliinnn amount of deposits which would accumulate at any time hi a lim ited postal savings bank Is $1100.000.01 )0 ) , or about 15 per cent of tile apn-0ate deposits of existing private savings hanks. If these Institutions can not bear the strain of losing from 10 to 15 per cent of their deposits they must bo wc.tk Indeed. The apprehension that government competition with Its limitations on tlu > amounts receivable from depositors and Its low rate of Interest will be fatal to tlie continuance of the existing savings banks Is groundless. If It were well founded it would bo the strongest argu ment In favor of the postal savings bank system. That system is advocated chiefly for the protection of the wage- workers whose industry and thrift ena ble them to lay by a part of their earn ings to acquire a homo or for the emer gencies of sickness or enforced idleness. 1'liis class of people have been tlie prin cipal sufferers from bank failures and are always least able to bear the losses intlicted by bank mismanagement or dishonesty. If the government can protect - tect these people fully at an expense of from ? "i,0X,000 ( ) to ? 0,000,000 , per annum paid out as Interest for strengthening its financial system , tlie money will be profitably Invested. It Is safe to assert that postal savings banks will in no way come Into competi tion with existing banks In the money loaning business or In the purchase of mortgages and other securities. That function should never be exercised by the government cither through the po&r- olllce or the treasury. On Ilici contrary , postal savings banks can be made a ma terial help to tlie hanking system by using tlie postotllces as a repository of the greenbacks. Instead .of retiring the greenbacks , as advocated In some quar ters , or Imprisoning them in the treasury as proposed by others , the greenbacks can be absorbed as the reserve for the repayment of postal savings deposits. Instead of being concentrated In th > > great money centers , the greenbacks would thus be distributed over fae en tire country through from 7,000 to 10,000 postctilces , preventing the repetition of the endless chain by which the treaHiiiy could lc ) drained of Its gold In a fuw days. While being absorbed by tin- postal savings banks the greenbacks would remain available for circulation among the masses. This feature would In itself make the postal savings bank system invaluable as an adjunct to the treasury. NA Tl Off A I , QUA IIA X T1A B. Senator Caff cry of Louisiana , who had tin annoying experience with state quarantine regulations during the yel low fever outbreak , has Introduced a 1)111 ) In the senate for placing quarantine reg ulations exclusively In the hands of the federal authorities. President McKinley deemed this matter of sulliclent Impor tance to give it a place In Ills message ami it is also referred to In the report of the secretary of the treasury. The latter refers with approval to the opinion of the surgeon general of the marine hospi tal service that national quarantine reg ulations should bo made paramount to those of the states and that there should bo legislation that will prevent Interfer ence with national regulations by state or local authorities. The secretary of the treasury says that the necessity for Interstate quarantine has been forcibly revealed during the recent epidemic of yellow fever In the south and ho sug gests that the law should bo so framed that it will bo within the province of the secretary of the treasury promptly to es tablish a qui.nintlne station without re gard to the state or local quarantine at whatever points and at any time that ho may deem It nccr&mry for the public safety to take such action. It Is saltl that the yellow fever visita tion was more costly than a financial panic to the people immediately af fected by It , because of the commercial paralysis It entailed. This was duo to the unueccHsarily rigid state and local quarantine regulations , which operated gem-inlly to put a stop to trade , while at the same time causing a vast amount of Individual annoyance , hardship and 

IOHS. Dr. Drake , the chief Burgeon of the Southern railway , says the most unrea sonable quarantine regulations were Im posed. One slate quarantines against another state and one town against an other town. Quo or two small villages In Alabama and Mississippi quarantined even against the world. Travel was In terfered with or wholly suspended ; com merce AVIIS paralyzed throughout Ala- liainn , SIIsslsslppI , Umlslana and Texas and greatly hampered In all contiguous states. The mails were stopped nnd moro than once destroyed by local authorities. It has been estimated that the loss from business stagnation In New Orleans nlono amounted to n.000,000. Such fucta certainly seem to conclu * uhotv tho. nccesulty fr | n. clinngo ami a * Dr Drake says they form n tell * Ing object lesson which must convince the stnnnchcftt supporter of state auton omy that the federal government should take ontlro nnd complete control of quar antine. Homo opposition to Jills IS 4' > bo expected , but the sentiment Uinf" has been developed In favor ot * a national system oC quarantine , under the nbsoluto control of the government , Is so strong and nowhere stronger than In the south , where opposition would ordinarily bo looked for thnt It appears safe to say that the proposal to place In control of the federal authorities all quarantine regulations against certain diseases will be adopted by congress. TJ\K \ jir The Carter bill providing for the twelfth census , which will bo tiikon In 1000lll come up for consideration in the senate this week. It Is expected that there will be a very sharp contest over the question whether the merit sys- iem shall bo applied In nuking appoint ments' for coustit work or the large army of employes In this service shall bo se lected by senators mid representative"- " In other words , whether the census bu reau In 1SKX ) shall be given over to the spoilsmen or subjected to civil service regulations , as are other branches of tlie public son-Ice. The Carter bill contem- pinion the former condition and the friends of civil service reform In congress - gross will undoubtedly make a very earnest effort to amend the measure lu this particular. The lice has already expressed the opinion that the merit system should be applied In the appointment of clerks for census work and it is pleasing to find this view supported by so competent an authority as Mr. Robert I * . Porter , who was superintendent of tlie clovenui cen sus. In an article In the current number of the North American Review Mr. Porter ter points out the faults of the present census system , which lie thus enumer ates : Inadequate time for preparation : a hard and fast law rushed through the day before the adjournment of congress , calling for innumerable statistical in vestigations and inquiries , many of which are useless and Impracticable and .some of which are Impossible ; sup plemental questions for the twenty mil lion or moro schedules , called for by con gress ninety days prior to the actual enumeration ; placing upon the shoulders of the superintendent , whose mind should bo fully occupied with his experts In planning the work , the responsibility of the appointment of an otllce force of several thousand clerks. Mr. Porter says that congress can lemedy these de fects by making the census n permanent olllce of the government and applying to it precisely the same rules and regula tions as to the employment of clerical help as are in vogue In other depart ments. There is no doubt as to tlie soundness of these suggestions. They iiro In harmony with the opinion of tlie iblest statisticians in the country. "It will be better iu my opinion , " says Mr. Porter , "to draw the clerks for the twelfth census from the classified serv ice , but chiefly because by so doing It will strengthen the faith of the public in tlie census. " It is not to be expected that this testi mony of experience will have any ueight with the spoilsmen in congress , but it ought to have Influence with the friends of civil service reform and stim ulate them to make a determined effort to prevent control by the spoilsmen of clerical appointments for tlie nest de cennial census. Unless this Is done there may bo dlfllculty In securing an entirely capable man 10 superintend the work. TllK
