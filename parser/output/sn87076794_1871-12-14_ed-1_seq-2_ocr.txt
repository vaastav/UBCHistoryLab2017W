Foster has been put up on the Claims Committee of Conjrress. It is a very important position. A. C. Van Tine, of Sandusky city wu confirmed as postmaster of chat city on Monday last. A good ap pointment. "With or without the 'new depar ture' no well-informed or candid man would now nay that the Democratic party is likely to carry the election in 1S72." These are the words of Mont gomery Blair, one of the chief of the party. The income tax law expired by it own limitation on the .'Kith of next month, and memlx-rs of the Commit tee of Ways and Means express the opinion that no attempt will be made to revive it. The collection of the two and a half per cent, on income" above $2,000 in 1871 will be collected n March next, and with that, it is probable the last of the lax will be seen. We could not apeak of the Presi dent's Message last week editorially, owing to lack of pace, and now it is one of the things of the past, so it is hardly worth while to comment. The message was generally well received, and contained more elements to make it popular than any state paper for years. It was brief, plain and terse in it recommendations and sugges tions, and wise in Its general policy. CAUGHT AT LAST. Our readers will doubtless remem ber one "Col." J. W. Howard, who stumped this district in the interests of the liemocracy in 1SCS, the campaign in which fraudulent naturlization pafpers were so free ly distributed. The "Col." deser ted a very esttimable wife and pretty child in this place. She subsequently learned that her faithless husband tiad been twice married before he se cured her affections and that it was not certain that ne nal procured a divorce from either of them. We now see it stated that said Howard has been arrested in Peoria county III., for bigamy. He is a most grace less scamp and we trust that thej law may be made to lash him as he rk-h-ij deserves. Toff fin Commrr'-int. This is the fellow, if we are net mis taken, that spoke in the Court House in behalf of Democracy during the last campaign. At the time we sta ted that he was here and "had a wo man with him." He wrote us a let ter about it stating that the woman was not a "woman," but "his wife,'' and seemed to feel bad. CONGRESSIONAL. DEC. 3. Both Houses of Con gresn met and organized. In the Senate several resolutions were introduced, among them one directing an inquiry into the expediency of immediately rebuilding the public buildings in Chi cago. The President's Message was read and ordered printed, as also the reports of the several heads of Departments.- Mr. Blair offered a resolution asking the President ti show cause for the suspension of the writ of ho. tea rorput in certain sections of South Carolina. It Is not supposed that if Mr. Blair's resolution were passed, the President would have a difficult task to perform. Mr. Logan introduced a bill to provide for the re lief of the sufferers by the Chicago fire, providing for the free tran-porta- j tion of goods and merchandise con tdbuted in foreign countries fur their relief, and also suspending the collec tion of internal revenue duties till the close of the next regular session of Congress, in favor of such persons owning property in the First Collec tion District of Illinois as have suffer ed material loss by the fire. The Sen ate then adjourned.. In the House, the roll was responded to by 201 members. The speaker an nounced the Standing Committees. After some unimportant business the House listened to the reading of the President's Message, and at 2:40 ad journed. Dec. 6. In the Senate, various bills were introduced. A resolution was adopted calling for the correspondence on the Catacazy matter. Mr. Blair tried to get up his resolution on the s uspension of the writ of habeas cor pus in South Carolina, but failed. Mr. Kellogg introduced his steamship bill and had it tabled. In the House, several bills were in troduced and referred. A bill was re ported from the Postoffice Committee consolidating the postal laws. The House went into Committee of the Whole on the President's Message and debated the President's recommenda tion for the absorption of the telegraph in the postal system. The question was on its reference, the friends of the scheme wanting a special committee, and the opponents wanting a refer ence to one of the regularcommittees. It was finally referred to tiie Appro priation Committee by a vote oflOl to 98. Adjourned. Dec. . In the Senate, fr. Antho ny introduced a bill to enforce the right of citizens of the Tinted Slates to vote In the several States; als, a bill to punish bribery and corrupt practices in the election of Presiden tial electors and members of Congress. Ineffectual effort! were m U t take up the general amnesty bill. A mes sage was received from the President, transmitting the correspondence in the Caticazy case. After a short executive session, the Senate adjourn ed. Iu the House, the select committee, on the reorganization of the civil ser vice was announced. The morning hour arrived, pending the bill consoli dating the postal laws. Tlie balance of tne day was spent in Committee of the Whole on the apportionment bill. EC- ".In the Senate, a resolution from the soldiers at "the Dayton Asy lum, for a modification of the pension sion laws, was presented. Bills were introduced regulating the pay of offi cers in the Xavy and Executive de partments, and to incorporate a pos tal telegraph. Thelist of Committees was read. The resolution to arrest re cusant witnesses in the Carolines, was debated. After an executive session, the Senate adjourned till Monday. After introducing various bills, and partially reading the bill codifying the postal laws, the House adjourned till Monday. Dec. 11. In the Senate, the House general amnesty bill was favorably reported. Mr. Sumner introduced his bill abolishing the Internal Revenue Bureau. Mr. Conkling introduced a resolution requiring the Military Com mittee to inquire into the defalcation of Paymaster Hodge. Mr. Trumbull moved, as a substitute, his resolution reviving the Joint Committee on Re trenchment, and spoke in advocacy of t his motion. In the House, the usual Monday batch of bills were introduced on the call of States. Mr. Lynch' motion that the Committee on Expenditures in the Treasury Department inquire into the accounts of that department was adopted. A concurrent resolution to adjourn from December 21 to Janu ary 8, was adopted. Mr. Wood tried, but failed, to get in a resolution say ing, that as the Republican party was in power, it should perform a number of deeds, such as revive American commerce, restore specie payments and soon. A bill appropriating $480, 000 to supply the deficiencies in the census fund was passed. ' j to to Its as in ; ; j ful ! : In a as a to in the for

AGRKLLTLRAL woiiKs. The Tiffin Agricultural Works com- , menced operations in 18-8, under the . firm of Smith, Barnes & Co. After career ofseven years, in iw5 j it was changed from an individual j partnership to a joint stock company, being the lirst established company of i the kind that organized under the present law regulating joint stock ; companies. These works make a ' speciality of the Tiffin Pake "; Parnes' Hevolving Horse Pake, of) which they sold, during the past year, 8,000. Horsepowers, threshing ; machines, &c., are also made, rrom ; business enterprise and financial success her people stand squarely in ; therontrank. ; As I have before intimated, the at- tention of Tiffin enterprise has been ; largely directed to manufacturing pur-1 if.it.. and it is to this source that she, I must chiefly look for her future im- ! thirty to fifty hands find constant employment here, and there are few manufacturing etab!ihhments which pay a lietter dividend to stockholders than the Tiflin Agricultual Works. 

OHIO STOVE WOKKS. In lSti4, r. J. .S. Yerk enira?ed in the manufacture of stoves. Few had faith in this enterprise at its com-Jducing mencement, but Mr. . belongs to that class of men who know no such word as "fail." and now the Ohio Stove Works are known throughout a scope of country and the business has grown to a most astonishing mag nitude. They are now manufacturing over forty different kinds of stoves, from two to five sizes each. The moulding department requires over i ... .u j ..11: 4nW.. ,1 over SlOO.iKlO ner vear.

THE TIFFIN CARRIAGE WORKS. There are few persons in this sec tion of country who do not know Pete Van Xest, and the carriages, buggies, etc, bearing his trade mark are al ways in demand. Perhaps it is not so well known that those desirable vehicles are manufactured in Tiffin. He commenced the manufacturing business here in 1848, and, outside of Cleveland, his is the oldest carriage manufacturing establishment in North ern Ohio. The walls of his office here are literally covered with first prem ium cards obtained at State and Coun ty Fairs. He is now manufacturing about 12-5 carriages and buggies per year. Some, of his carriages are of princely elegance, while his buggies will compare favorably with the best makes in the country. He finds a ready sale in Eastern and W'estern markets for all the vehicles turned out by the Tiflin Carriage Works. BENT WORK. hounds for wagons, is doing a good fiZSZZSt ZSZSZ. l F. Smith, the Inventor of bent those who have once tried the bent hound will not be satisfied with the old-fashioned rickety aifairs which have been used for that purpose. It seems that two patents have been is sued for the same invention, and just as sion as the difficulty growing out of this make can be adjusted, Mr. Smith will make arrangements for the general introduction of his valua ble invention. BENT WORK. KUDER & FREY. have just cleverly started in the manufacture of carriages, buggies, &c. They now have facilities for making from 50 to 100 vehicles per year, but propose to enlarge their buildings and their business in the spring. H. S. WENNER. also manufactures buggies, carriages! wagons, 4c, and his work is quite popular with the people of Seneca county, who want strength and beau ty combined. He sold 54 carriages and buggies last year and expects to ex tend his business the coming year. SASH, DOORS, BLINDS, &c. Messrs. Adams & Letterhos hnve just erected a fine three story brick building OOi.100 feet, for their exten sive business, on the river bank, on Market street. They have the best grades of machinery and employ a number of hands. I have only glanced at some of the more prominent manufacturing in terests uere, but the reader will readi ly discover that Tiffin has already ob tained a good start on the road to fu ture Importance as a manufacturing center. I would scarcely do justice did I not mention the fact that Mr. Zahm has opened a news depot here which is meeting with great favor. to It The Message The President's Message is before our readers. It is an unpretending, practical matter-of-fact State paper, which challenges the general appro bation of the country, both in respect the acts of the auministration.dur ing the eventful year that is drawing a close and in the measures of leg islation recommended to Congress. distinguishing merit is that it is not encumbered with constitutional chop logic. Compared with the an nual Messages of his "illustrious pre decessors," from General Jackson down to Mr. Johnson, the great Scu' western expounder of the constitu tion, this Message of Gen. Grant is a model of brevity, though full cf meat an egg. Even a brief review of half the numerous important subjects it touched upon would occupy a much larger space than the document itself, and so for the present our re marks upon it will be mainly address ed to a few of the leading topics pre sented. 5 7 To sum up this Message : asan expor sition of the doings of the administra- tion iu the management of all the vast concerns of the several depart- ments of the government, on the land and the water, at home and abroad, during the year which is now closing, it is a good exhibit of a faith ' execution of the laws, an honest disposition of the public money and a rigid punishment of public defaulters. the next place, the Message in its recommendations to Congress covers budget of legislative measures and reforms necessary or wholesome in their character. In a word, whether considered as ambitious only to pro mote the material prosperity and moral advancement of his couutry, or a political campaign document from candidate for another Presidential term, this Message is well calculated strengthen General Grant and to weaken his adversaries throughout the to all a by not To bor to and N.

It is said that several prominent men of Ohio have written to Judge; The taking of the ktst census of the United States cost 2,807,600, much less in proportion to the work done than any previous census. A Democratic Representative, of an inquiring turn of mind, intends intro- a resolrition in the House to find out the amount that has been sto len and embezzled during the present Administration. We are glad of it. One Democratic paper says the President's Message is too short ; in other that it Is too long. One says it is evident that the President wrote it, because it is ungrammatical and a not fa it, be cause it is a brief, terse,scholarly docu ment, carefully written. So the dis cussion runs. The opponents of Gen. Grant had their "last legs" knocked out from un der them by the Message. It is a pop ular document and leaves them with out a foothold for opposition.

YORK TRIBUNE. For 1872. Tlie consolidation of Italy, so long fragmentary and impotent, into one powerful State, with Rome as its capital: the humiliation of France through a series of crushing defeats, ending with the siege and capitula tion of her proud and gay metropolis ; the expulsion of the Bourbons from the Spanish throne, and the substitu tion for them of a scion of the most liberal among royal houses ; the vir tual absorption of the kingdoms of Saxony, Wurtem burg, Bavaria, with Baden, Hesse, the Hanse Towns, &c., under the headship of Prussia, into the triumphant and powerful empire of Germany ; and the arming of Rus sia to reassert her preponderance in the councils of Europe, or to prosecute her often postponed but never relin quished designs on the great city founded by Constantine and the vast but decaying and anarchical domin ion of the Sultan, all combine to in vest with profound interest the ever changing phases of our tidings from the Old World. The Tribune, through trusted correspondents sta tioned at all points in Europe where great movements are in progress or imminent, aims to present a complete and instructive panorama of events on that continent, and to mirror the prolonged struggle between middle age Feudalism and Ecclesiasticism on one hand; and the Nineteenth Century skepticism on the other. Recognizing a Divine Providence in that proceeds and is, it looks hope fully on the great conflicts as destin ed (like our own recent convulsion) evolve from strife, disaster, and seeming chaos, a fairer and happier future for the masses of mankind. In our own country, a war upon corruption and rascality in office lias been inaugerated in our City, where by the government of our State has been revolutionized through an ini tial triumph of Reform which surpas ses the 'most sanguine anticipations. is morally certain that the move ment thus inangerated cannot, in its progress, be circumscribed to any lo cality or any party, but that its puri- influence is destined to be felt every part of the Union, rebuking venality, exposing robbery, wresting from politicians by trade, and conn- ding it in those worthiest and fittest wield it. To this beneficent and vitally needed Reform, The Tribune will devote its best energies regard less of personal interests or party pre dilections, esteeming the chotc of honest and faithful men to office as of Xew Depatures the most essential and auspicious. The virtual surrender of the Demo cratic party of its hostilities to Equal Rights regardless of Color has divest ed our current politics of half their bygone intensity. However parties may henceforth rise or fall, it is clear that the fundamental principles which have hitherto honorably dis tinguished the Republicans are hence forth to be regarded as practically ac cepted by the whole country. The right of every man to his own limbs sinews the equality of all citi zens before the law the inability of State to enslave any portion of its people the duty of the Union to guar antee to every citizen the full enjoy ment of his liberty until he forfeits it crime such are the broad and firm foundations of our National edi fice ; and palsied be the hand which shall seek to displace them ! Though yet twenty years old, the Repub lican party has completed the noble fabric of Emancipation, and may fairly invoke thereon the sternest judgment of Man and the benignant smile of (iod.

FAIIRXEY'S Celebrated Blood Cleanser or Panacea, As a medicine for children, the Panacea is. every way, calculated to take the place of the endless vnriety of drugs which are an nually sold for that purpose, and which are oflen verp injurious. A medicine which tiossesses the qualities of a cathartic as well a mild alterative, anil which is capable of arresting disease without ine ic.it injury to the child, is of incalculable value to every mother. As a cathartic. It is very effective, yet it does not, if given in proper quantities, cause nausea or distress to tlie stomach or bowels. It is very pleasant to the taste, which Is a ver Important feature as a medi cine for children. As n prrvrnthe of disease Is unprecedented, as it acts directly u)on the digestive organs and the blood. In all scrofulous discuses, it is the most effective medicine ever offered to the pnblld; and given regular and perseveringly tbove eruptive disease so common to children may entirely eradicated.
