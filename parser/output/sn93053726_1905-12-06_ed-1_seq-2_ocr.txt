The president's message is the all absorbing topic at present, and the opinions and criticisms run from high to low and back again. The views of the Connecticut men who heard it read yesterday will be of more than or dinary Interest just at present. The lawmakers from this state were inter viewed soon after the reading of the message in the. two houses and ex pressed themselves briefly with re spect to its various phases as follows: Senator Bulkeley said: "The message is a thoughtful discussion of many of the important questions that are up permost in the public mind, and con tains wise recommendations for the consideration of congress." Senator Brandegee spoke as follows: "The tone of the message is excellent. It Is well considered, judicial and temper ate. It again makes it plain that Mr Roosevelt is president of the wTiole people and is Interested In and famil iar with the affairs-of all classes and every section. The message Is an able state paper and a valuable contribution to the literature of the many great questions which are at present promi nently before the public." Mr Henry said: "The presi dent's message Is character istically Rooseveltlan, and con sequently forcible, thoroughly log ical, notably philosophical. Most of the suggestions and recommendations made will meet with popular approval; naturally some will encounter criti cism and probably opposition. The most prominent feature, the lengthy discussion of proposed railroad rate legislation, . is comprehensive and ex- haustive, aud will undoubtedly receive careful and, I believV1talS8 JtShm fa-aft farms stand it wiffiSUCSaRHsttug vorable consideratIOBSJ5dpVss."ijan5ving margin. The bank, ifceufcib- Mr Sperry said. "The message Is a very fair presentation of what the pres ident would like congress to do. It will undoubtedly command general at tention and respect. Its language is vigorous and leaves no doubt as to the president's meaning." Mr Hill said: "I am much pleased with the message as a whole, hut the treatment of the railroad, revenue, cur rency and Philippine questions Is espe cially gratifying. The difference be tween the fair propositions of the mes sage concerning the. railroads and the one-sided, arbitrary and unjust provis ions of the Esch-Townsend bill of last year, is very pronounced. A year's discussion of this great subject has had fortunate results, where hasty ac tion might have proved disastrous." Mr Lilley expressed himself as fol lows: "A characteristic and very com prehensive document covering a wide scope. The matters not touched upon are of very little Interest to the great body of the American people. Person ally I favor a'l the president's sugges tions, and I might add, any others he chooses to make. No other man more nearlv voices the sentiments of hit." countrymen." Mr Hlggins said: "One cannot but be impressed with tne magnlture of the questions before this longrtss and how vital their correct solution Is to the welfare of this whole country. If ! doubt ever existed in the mind of a single citizen that President Roosevelt was not close to the people and alive to their needs a carefnl reading of his message must forever dispel that doubt." Apparently we are running into a period of blind optimism, where men are ready to act against their own best reason, says Banker Clews. How long this will last cannot at present be de termined, but no settled change seems probable so long as general business conditions 1 remain satisfactory, and quite possibly this will continue until speculation breaks down through its own sheer excess. Reports from farm, mine and mill continue most flattering. Nearly all are finding a profitable mar ket for everything they can produce. There Is no overproduction yet . In eight and were it not to the disturb ing influence of undue speculation present current prosperity might run smoothly for an indefinite period with out any obstruction. In consequence of these condition! values on the stork exchange are expo d to sharp fluctu ations. Much activity Jus been shown, particularly by few clique, some of which are still heavily loaded with se curities showing a large profit and which necessarily will be unloaded at the first good oip Tiroity, It is evl- iV-jt Jhst there has beea a good of -,-,M-aled liquidation, and In the a . ..t wi uim f thai . . It i st -ii.it: whirh hav r t!y arrested titin may Cnd a Donaal level J Another. feature' of significance was the decision of the St Paul manage ment to begin building operations to the Pacific coast at once. During the next" few months the supply of -new railroad securities will be considerably increased. The past decade has wit nessed comparatively little new rail road mileage, the result being that west of the Mississippi the country has fully grown up to and in some cases exceeded transportation facili ties. It is quite within the natural order of things, therefore to see a re vival of Tailroad enterprise in the far west There is not the slightest prospect of free trade or anything like' it with the Philippines, says our Washington correspondent, but Colonel Clarence Edwards, chief of the bureau of In sular affairs, has recommended it in his report just issued as one of the crying needs of the islands. Colonel Edwards! who knows the islands and their needs thoroughly, says there are three things needed for their mnterial prosperity, namely, a market, a bank from which they can borrow on rea sonable terms, and transporatioh lines. The government has already author ized the construction of a thousand miles of railways in the islands, so the latter, part of the triple recommenda tion will not be urged just now. But Colonel Edwards "says there Is great need for the market and the bank. To secure the first, he asks to have the duties removed from all articles except sugar and tobacco, which are to be subject to 25 per cent of the Dingley rates. This is practically the recom mendation of the so called Curtis bill, which passed the house last session and will be re-introduced with about the same chance of running the gaunt let of the senate as it had before. The beet sugar and the tobacco interests are said to be the only ones seriously opposing the measure. They will be further incensed at Colonel Edwards's additional recommendation that at the end of the ten year period conversed by the treaty of Faris which ended the war with Spain, the islands should be given absolutely free trade. This measure for the relief of the islanders does not stand much show. But there will be more friends of the proposal to establish an agricultural bank. It is stated that now the farmers who want to borrow money on their growing crops, a practice that formerly was general in the south, but which now fortunately is dying out, have to pay from 2 per cent to 10 per cent a month for the money. It has to be a pretty remunerative farm that will stand this sort of uRiiry and leave a living mar gin to the farmer. Some of the Philip- 11 shed, will be made under the control of the Philippine commission, though it will be a private undertaking. The concession will be granted and the dividends guaranteed for a ternt of say twenty-five years and the commis sion will have the right to define the nature of securities and limit the amount of interest charged. The bank promises to be a paying institution from the start aud it is hoped will en able the farmers to Improve their hold ings and to buy the necessary fertiliz ers, animals and agricultural Imple ments. The report also recommends the extensions of the homestead law with a view to further encouraging set tlement

The railroad, by all the laws of the nation, is quite as much a highway as is a wagon road. But instead of levrlnr diret-t taxes for keeping ot the rail-highways (as- do the people v Prussia. Austria, Switzerland a. id other countries we Americans "farm out" the power of taxation to private indivklnals organized as a rallrwid corporation. The old kimr fanned out the power of ordnarry taxation to their favorite baron In the same way The instrument that conveys this power nnn a railroad cmnsny is a "charter." It give the railroad rnr.i rnr the right to op ate the rail- hiirbway and to charge a freigh rate fa tax) for doinr. it Railroad presidents and directors are thus by appointment made the tax-cnUerting rnTisiitjrtive of the two.
