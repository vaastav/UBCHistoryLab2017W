Following is a brief synop sis including some direct excerpts of the more important features of the the of the hill 113 message; TO THE 

SENATE AND HOUSE OF RHFHKSENATl VKS: Nothwlthstandlng th« add« burde WÊÊÊÊÊBÊ the war, our w-ople rejoice In a very Ifc/actory and «tcadlly-lncreasing at of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded.

CONTROVERSY WITH SPAIN RE VIEWED. In rovU wing the controversy which led up to the war with Spain, the president takes up the thread or narrative where it terminated In hi« Inst annual «age. He concluded: "It wan honestly due to our friendly relation» with Spain that »ho should be given a reasonable chancö to realize her expectation» of re form to which who had become irrevoca bly committed.'' H became evident, however, that, the proposed plans were barren of good re sults, No tangible relief was afforded the ^■■■tntra'ioN, among whom theHÜH of mortality frightfully increased; the proffered expedient of zone» of cultiva tion proved illusory, and it was apparent that nothing »ave the physical exhaus tion of Spain or the Cuban» and the prac tical ruin of the Island of Cuba could re »ult from the struggle then in progress, DBSTRUt 

TION OF THE MAI NE. At this critical Juncture tho destruc tion of the battleship "Maine" occurred. Concerning it the president says: "It Is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good set,so u.sdnguisft!f% our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, al ready deeply touched uy preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an in stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition ot dangov and disorder at our doors that made possible »uch a deed, by whomso ever wrought." Resuming the wgr narrative, the presi dent direct« »ittyhtlon to tho measures, ln&nliviK lKfi,(l6p)0,.fllX) appropriation for natfotuil o«cuf% taken to place tho country on. à Äaf footing, and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war, when it. did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the feonfUct."

Ne gotiations w'lth the Madrid government, proved futile, so far uh practical results were concerned, and then it was the president presented the question to con gress, saying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf or endangered American interest», which give us thp right and duty to speak and «.«SI* tn Uuba must stop."

As lo the authorized loan of $200,000.000. which was taken entirely by small l»ld ders, the president says: "This was a most encouiaging and significant result, showing the vent resources of the nation and tho •btermlnnUon of the people to uohold their country's honor," v Taking up chronologically the event :inJ'"^'K ll ''.. l .' r r* k,en( ■'■'Vlawa I hum enre iully. rho first encounter was the nhell Ing of Mçtanaa» on Atirll 'J7.
