Dalton was not the first to propose the theory which makes all matter con sist of atoms. The Greek and Roman philosophers, wise men of the east in Egypt and India, and such eminent moderns as Sir Isaac Newton and Leibnitz had advocated the theory in gome form. Democritus (E. B., Vol. VII. 59) had advanced a form of the theory, not only the earliest, but the most remarkable in the history of sci ence. Among the moderns, Newton had insisted on the existence in all bodies of unbreakable, unwearable, im penetrable particles, each kind of which remains always the same in size, weight, figure and force, so that how ever compounded, the nature and tex ture of the compounds are always the same.

The Upper House of Congress Convenes on the Stroke of Twelve. Washington, Dec. 2. The United States senate was called to order at noon today by Vice President Stevenson. The decorum of the upper branch of congress is seldom disturbed even by the opening of congress, and today, with crowded galleries and a general air of expectancy, there was tbe same even and unruffled proceedure which characterizes the senate. All the galleries, public and private, except that reserved for the diplomatic corps, weje filled to overflowing by 11 o'clock and the outer corridors were crowded with those unable to gain ad mission. The senators began to gather early in the day exchanging greetings and renewing acquaintances. Air. Jones of Arkansas and Mr. leller of Colorado were among the first ar rivals. They were soon joined by the venerable Senator Hoar, of Mass, and his colleague, Mr. Lodge. Mr. Peffer and Mr. Allen showed special attention to the acquisitions to the Populist senatorial ranks. There was a special interest in the many new faces. Mr. Martin, of Virginia, was in troduced to his associates by Mr. Daniel.

In impressive tones, the blind chap lain of the senate invoked divine bless ing on the chamber, referring eloquent ly to the affliction in tbe family of ex Senator Wilson of Indiana and to the absence of Isaac Basset the veteran door keeper, who is now dangerously ill. The first business transacted was the swearing in of new senators and of those re-elected. They proceeded to the clerk's desk in groups of three and four, accompanied by their state colleagues, and with up lifted right hands, look the oath as it was read by the vice-president. The usual f6rmal resolutions were quickly adopted.'
