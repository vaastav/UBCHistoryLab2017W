The Sulser resolution, already adopted by the house directing that termination of the treaty after a year's notice was brought u today In the senate. The result of a running tie bate on the question of w halh. r to re fer it to the committee on foreign relations or to act immediately was an assurance from the comn-.'t'ee that it would report Monday.

CALMLY VIF.WS 1'AS.spOliT CONTKOV FltSY St. Petersburg, Dec. 14. The Jew ish passport ouestlon has awakened only slight public interest here. The j prospect of tlie abrogation of tho treaty of D32 does not seem to dis turb any one. Good relations with the I'nlted Slate are duly appreciat ed and especially as they affect the Far East, but It Is pointed out that lliisslu and Gctiiuiny waged u tariff war In the nineties during which they remained on good terms politically. The abrogationor the treaty woulO. affect Hussian trade to the extent of about $X, IKiO.oflo annually, whereas American trade to four time that amount would be affected. Abroga tion of the treaty, It Is realised, would strike a more vital blow If by reason of this Hussian subjects were shut out of America. From the standpoint of the Hussian govern ment the cessation of Jewish emigra tion would be disagreeob'e, but the government does out believe the mat ter would lie pressed so tar. On the oilier hand the government sees a graver peril In tin indiscrim inate admission of Jews to Russia a many of these. It Is asserted by gov ernment officials are revolutionists, socialists and anarchists. Their com ing, armed with American passports ami with the right to claim consular sill, It Is said, would endanger pub lic ieute und cause diplomatic fric tion and a serious aggravation of Itiisso-Amerlcaii relations. The Jewish question loom so large in llussla proper that the (iip tion of Husso. American relation takes secotidury place and finally, it Is declared, Russia cannot sur render control over the admission ot foreigners within her borders. These are tlie representative views In gov ernment and business circles, M. Sasuinoff, the foreign minister, litis classified till the Jews who coubl possibly come to Russia In two di visions, it Is said. First come busi ness men and second revolutionist und anarchists. Hut ordinary citi zens who are neither business men nor revolutionists, seem lo liuva been overlooked or forgotten. I'nlesS positive objection can be taldished against this or that partic ular person all must be admlttcil without distinction of race. STEAMSHIPS SHORT OF CREWS AND LIFE BOATS Washington, Dec. I I.
