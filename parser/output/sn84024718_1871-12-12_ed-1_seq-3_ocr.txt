A spirit always ready to take hold oi an enterprise, and push it along, so as to insure its success. People of a passive or negative disposition never do anything towards helping on a place; if it grows, it is without any assistance from them ; they are mere drones in a hive, and while they may never do any harm, they never do much good. It is your bold, active, persistent, self-reliant man who always succeeds, and it is this class of peo ple, above all others, that builds up and sustains every great public enterprise. While others are planning and getting ready to work, they have gone ahead and reaped all the Tewards of suc cess." The columns of the Spectator show where bar gain? are to be had.

Miss Jeanie Patterson. — We take pleasure in stating to tbe Staunton public that this gifted young lady will give an entertainment of Read ing and Recitation in this city, one evening this week—time and place to be given hereafter. — The following notice, taken from a Southern ex change, will acquaint our readers with her his tory and the object of her reading— "Miss Patterson is a very young lady, but she has already won no inconsiderable fane thro'- out tbe South by her talents as a reader and elo cutionist. Her history is a peculiar one, and mournful as it is peculiar. The young lady is a native of Mississippi, her place of nativity be ing, we believe, "the famous old town of Port Gibson in that State. Reared in affluence and tenderly nurtured, she found herself at the close of terrible years of war, like most people in our unhappy country, poor and compelled to person al industry for the support of her aged adopted mother, to whom this young girl, untried as she was in the ways of the world, was all that was left capable of practical exertion. After reflec ting gravely over her capacities for profitable industry in some especial channel. Miss Patter son determined to go upon the stage, and by the exercise of her talents as a reader, cultivated when no forewarning voice whispered that their future application would be for bread, earn for herself and thoso dependent upon her that sup port of which the accident of war had cruelly deprived them. And the selection, prompted by sharp necessi ty and filial devotion, has proved entirely suc cessful. Wherever the young reader bas ap peared, enthusiastic audiences have greeted her, and golden words of praise and encouragement have made bright her arduous way." Editorial criticisms from a large number of journals all over the South bear flattering testi mony to her histrionic talent. In addition, she carries with her testimonials from prominent cit izens of the South and of our own State. We trust she will be received here, as at other places, with a crowded house. —=* .

CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS XLIInd CONGRESS, 2nd SESSION. " Senate—Monday, Dec. 4th.—Mr. Blair of fered a resolution of enquiry respecting the ex ecutijn of the Ku Klux law, wbich went over under object ions. The message was read and the Senate ad journed. House—The various committees were ap pointed. The calling of the roil showed that 201 mem bers were present. Mr. Beck offered a resolution asking the President certain questions regarding the exe cution ol the Ku Klux law, which meeting with a ptorm of objections, was referred to the Committee on Insurrectionary State?. Messrs. Conner and Hancock, of Texas, were sworn in, and the other Texas credentials were referred. The President's message was read, after which the House adjourned. Senate. —Tuesday, Dec. sth.—Mr. Blair's resolution of enquiry, covering a detailed report of the Executive action under the Ku Klux bill, was defeated. The vote was a strict party one, except Mr. Tipton. Mr. Kellogg introducted a bill to reorganize the I listrict courts in Louisiana; also, a bill providing for mail service between New Orleans and several Mexican ports. A resolution calling for tho Catacazy corres pondence was adopted, Mr. Cameron opposing it. House—There was a sharp discussion be tween Messrs. Wood and Davis regarding the continuance of the Committee on Insurrection ary States, which Mr. Wood maintained was a trick to continue the Reconstruction Commit tee. The Administration sustained its first defeat of the session on the subject of the postal tele graph. Mr. Dawes moved to refer to a select com mil tee so much of the President's message as re commended the absorption of the telegraph system in the postal Berviee of the country. This was opposed by Messrs. Randall, Farns worth, Niblack, Beck and Burks, who contend ed that the subjeci should not be taken from a standing committee and referred to a select one, which would necessarily, under the parliamen tary rule, have a majority in favor of the pro ject. After an animated discussion, in which the scheme was denounced as one that would bleed the Treasury to the ainouat of $70,000,000, and add 25 000 employees to the civil service of the government, the motion for a select committee was defeated, and the whole subject referred to the Committee on Appropriations, which is considered tantamount to a rejection of the pro ject. Senate—Wednesday, Dec. 6th.—ln the Senate to-day, concurrent resolutions calling Colonel Saunders, of North Carolina, and Messrs Camp and Gist, of South Carolina, to the bar of the Senate for contempt, went over un der the rules. The House resolutions calling for information regarding Cuba, and the paper in General Buell's military commission, were adopted. Mr. Anthony introducted a bill amending the election act, making it criminal to use any wri ting, deybc, token, word or gesture with intent to intimidate voters, or counseling or indirectly procuring the use of such means of intimida tion. Mr. Robertson endeavored to introduce an amnesty bill, but was declared out of" order. A caucus of the Senate appointed a commit tee of five to nominate committees. It seems probable that Mr. Morton wili succeed Mr. Cameron as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affair?. House.—The House considered the appor tionment bill, but reached no conclusion. Mr. Stevenson, from the Ku Klux Commit tee, offered a resolution ior the removal of po litical disabilities; extending the time within which the writ of habeas corpus may be sus pended, and making every member of the Ku Klux and other treasonable conspiracies respon sible, civilly and criminally, for the acts of their feliow-members Senate. —Thursday, Dec. 7th. —Mr. Sumner presented a memorial asking the abolition of the duty on coal. He thought that his supplemen tary civil rights bill should be taken up and passed as a Christmas gift to the colored people of the country. He also gave notice of a bill to reduce taxation and abolish the office of com missioner of internal revenue. Bills were intro duced increasing the pay of the principal de partment officials and of commanding officers in the navy. Also an important bill incorporat ing "The Postal Telegraph Company," design ed to do government and private business, and for the latter to charge not. exceeding 25 cents for the first twenty words over each circuit of 250 miles. The Senate elected its standing committees, with Mr. Sumner as chairman of the comuiiitce on privileges and elections—Mr. Cameron remaining at the bead of the commit tee on foreign relations—and the other commit tees composed substantially as at the last ses sion, the chairmen being the same throughout the list. After an executive session the Senate adjourned over to Monday, the 11th. House.—ln the House a resolution was a dopted calling upon the Interior Department for the necessary information a-certained, from the census, upon which to base the apportion ment of congressional representation among the States. The House adjourned until Monday, the 11th. _ : The Speakership. The nomination ol Major Marshall Hanger, of Augusta, by the Conservative caucus for the position of Speaker of the Boose of Delegatzs is, we presume, equivalent to an election. Major Hanger was frequently in the Speak er's chair during the sessions of the last legis lature, and it was the subject of general remark that he presided with great ability. His high character, good sense, and experience are an ample assurance that he will discharge the du ties of his high office to the satisfaction of the House and the public. His competitor in tbe caucus was General James A. Walker, of Pulaski, who would have made an excellent Speaker, and of whom it is praise enough tc say that he was chosen to suc ceed Genera! T. J. Jackson in the command of the Stonewall Brigade, and in the political campaign of 1868 was placed on the Withers, ticket for the position of Lieutenant-Governor of the State. The vote was very close—4l to 38. — Rich. Enquirer. ~«p. Attempted Murder and Robbery. Special tele-rani to the Dispatch. Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs December 9. —A daring attempt at murder was made here last night on the person of Mr. Sprowl, bar-keeper at this place. The attack was made by two negroes, who fired two shots, each of which took effect in the head of their victim. He was seriously though it is hoped not dangereusly wounded. It is supposed that the intenti n of the assaulters was first to mur der and then to rob Mr. Sprowl. The perpetra tors of the outrage are still at large, though the officers are on their track. Mr. Sprowl is now confined to his bed. .—, ,+-. I IST OF
