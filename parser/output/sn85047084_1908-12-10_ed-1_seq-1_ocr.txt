After a spirited debate in which the Flag and Constitution, the principles of Protection, the Organic Act, Patriot ism, Promotion and Pride were discuss ed at length, the Chamber of Commerce yesterday in a close vote decided to re new their request to Congress for a suspension of the Coastwise Laws as applied to passenger traffic between Ha waiian and other American ports. The debate was one of the best ever held in the Chamber, the speakers for and against the suspension of the laws al ternating in the presentation of facts, figures and arguments. E. D. Tenney led the minority and W. R. Castle the majority in the discussion. It was evi dent from the thoroughness with which the various speakers dealt with the question that a great deal of thought had been given to it during the past few days. a The meeting was a large one, quite as well attended and as representative as that which dealt recently with the site exchange proposal.'

The debate on the proposal to recall the lack of support to the bill before Congress suspending the operation of the Coastwise Law and to reaffirm that support was opened by the statement of the chair as to the special object of the meeting, which had been called at the request of a large number 1 of the members to reopen the discussion of the matter. In his remarks the chair referred to the President's message and to the cablegrams received relative to the recent actions of the commercial lodies from Governor Frear and Dele gate Kalanianaole. F. XI. Swanzy asked to be enlighten- The . question of tariff revision had been taken up in connection with the Chamber of Commerce and a plea for the maintenance of the present tariff protection ureed.

London ap peared in the Sydney Morning Herald of a current date: 'We looked forward to this trip for five years," said XIrs. Jack London. 'Mr. London had been reading Mr. Slocum's account of his trip, and was fired with the desire to take a similar one; so he asked me how I should like iVand when I said, 'It would be just he&venly,' the thing was settled. 'That was before we were married, and we decided that as soon as we had made our home we slrould set off. But you know homes aren't made in a day especially when they 're ranches, as ours is so one day I said to my hus band, 'We're getting no younger, and no- stronger. Let ua set off on our travels at once.' "So we made up our minds to leave the finishing of the ranch for a while and have the boat built at once and start. on our way. But 'the best-laid plans,' you know. The very day that the boat was to be .commenced was the day of the great earthquake. 'Of course, that meant scarcity of labor and raised prices, so our little bojat cost us just three times what it should have, and was six months later than we had expected. "However, we didn't take that as a batd omen, and, indeed, it wasn 't, for we've had the very loveliest time all through. At least, ever since we got rid of our original crew, for we began with the idea that friends would be the nicest people to have on board an, idea which we soon changed with the. crew; and now we have only one of the original members. "No, there was no other woman on board, and I never felt the need of one. If there had been more room I might have had one, but as it was I was quite happy without. I never had time to miss them, for my hus band and I have so many interests in common, and I help him with his work I do all his typing. And I had my own work, too, for I've been keeping a journal of the voyage. That's the first volume there, in those four boxes, all ready to be sent off. "No, I've never done very mueb. writing before just a few stories and magazine articles but I've always been in a HteTary atmosphere, and it comes naturally. Besides, there was so much to say about that trip that one couldn't help writing it down. My husband is doine a Solomon Islands novel now, unnamed at present. "But we didn't spend all our time writing, you know. There was lots to do on board, especially tfs there was often somebody ill. Whenever we were short-handed I took my turn at the wheel, but not very often. ' "I was just as much at home on board as any of the men. I discarded skirts altogether they were only in the way in such a small placa and had suits of serge and pongee, which were very much more suitable and comfortable. Of course, I carried' a wardrobe for ports; indeed, I was able to bring nearly all my clothes with me, so well is my cabin supplied with chests and lockers. There isn't much standing room, but I had plenty of lockers. I had no place for cabin trunks, though, and I've just had to buy those, for we are going to leave the Snark now for a few months and travel to Tasmania and New Zealand by steamer. t "We didn't mean to come to aus tralia ' this trip, but changed our minds at the last. That is one of the iovs of traveling as we are; we go inst where we like and when we like. We make no very definite plans, but inst An what, we want to When tne time comes. "At present I'm feeling rather tired and lazv. We stayed too long in the Solomon Islands, for they are very enervating; but when XIr. .Lon don is better I shall be rested, and 1 4 ..nt.nlln we mean to see as mucn 01 ausiw"" at vre ean.
