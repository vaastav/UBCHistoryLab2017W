Be it resolved by the Senate, (the House of Representatives concurring) That the Legislature of the State of Mis sissippi expresses it- coiitidence in the administration of Andrew Johnson, TreBident of the United States, so far as his public course has been developed in endeavoring to restore the people of .the Southern States, to their constitutional relations to, and equal rights in, the Union ; to the benefit which may flow from their participation in the councils of a re union of States. . It acknowledges his honesty of. pur pose, his firmness and determination, which thus far has marked his official career; and it extends to him the as Burance that his patriotic and noble efforts to heal the wounds of the country and to restore the Southern States to equality.epresentation and prosperity, meets its sanction and approval. Resolved further. That the Legislature of this State thank President Johnson for the various acts of official clemency and kindness he ha3 shown the people; and that they look forward with an.abid ing hope, but an equally anxious solici tude, for that happy day, when a general amnestv to one and all, shall crown bis name with unlading honor, and enable the people of a common country to hold a common rejoicing. Resolved further, That copy of these resolutions be transmitted, through bis Excellency the Governor of Mississippi, to the President of the United States.
