The business manager of The Morning Poit left for New York today to get the Mergenthaler machines, to be deliverttd January 1st.

Weyler's Mysterious Language Madrid, December 4. The newspapers of this city are excited over the myste rious words attributed to General "Wey ler after he had proposed a toast at the military banquet in his honor, at Palma, Island of Majorca.

Street K!lwyi in Hrlilnn Municipal ownership of street railway properties is making- such strides in Oreat Britain that it seems only a ques tion of time when ownership by private corporations will be a thing of the past. In Blackpool. Huddersfield, Hull, Leds, Blymouth, Sheffield, and Glasgow all rh street car lines are operated by the city authorities. In thirty other cities, including Birmingham, Liverpool, Man chester. Rdin'burgh, and London, the municipalities own or operate a part of the lines within their limits. In Car diff and Southampton the change to municipal ownership will probably be completed, before the end of the present year. In various other cities the street railway tracks belong to the munici pality and are leased for so much per mile, with a. percentage on gross earn ings.

STREET C AR ACCIDENT Three Persons Killed and Many Wounded by the Colllaon of Two Kl- ctrlc Cars Detroit, Mich., December 4. Two suburban cars carrying about twenty passengers and both running at a speed cf twenty-five miles an hour, collided on the Detroit and Oakland electric railroad this afternoon. Three men were instantly killed and a score of persons injured, ten of them seriously. The dead: John Savage, superintend ent of the road; Charles M. Whitehead, motorman; Jo'hn Kelly, of Detroit, book agent. The exact cause of the accident is as yet in doubt. According to the sched ule, a car leaves each end, Detroit and Pontiac, every hour and there are three sidings along the road. Today the cars were behind time. The one bound southward for Detroit had pass ed an otrtbound car at the swith two miles from Pontiac, the crew apparent ly being ignorant of the fact that another outbound car was approach ing them less than two miles distant, although it 13 claimed that they should have known it from orders sent from Birmingham. The weather was foggy and the rails slippery from the sleet which had 'been falling. The collision occurred near a gravel pit about mid way between Pontiac and Birming ham, at the foot of two steep grades, down which the cars ran at full speed. The car3 were driven half through each other and crushed to pieces. Superintendent Savage was in the motorman's vestibule operating the outbound car. Both his, legs were cut off and his body was frig'htfullly mangled. Motofman McHugh. who stood behind Savage, narrowly escap ed a similar fate. John Kelly was evi dently the only passenger -who saw the northbound car approaching. He rushed for the vestibule door and he and Motorman Whitehead were strug gling together to get out of the door when the crash came. Both were kill ed. Kelly's head and shoulders were jammed out of the vestibule window and his neck was broken. Whitehead's head was cut open and his chest crushed.

AUSTRIA'S DISMEMBERIIEUT A POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF THE PRESENT SITUATION. Hungary Likely to Assume Independence of the Empire The Contention Over Re newal of the Compact Between the Two Portions of the Dual State The War la India More Labor Troubles in .England . Another Strike Ordered. (Copyright by Associated Press.) London, December 4. International questions havo been temporarily over shadowed by the gravity of the situa tion in Austria, where things are as gloomy as imaginable. In addition to the imminence of a civil war, the next few hours may possibly witness a historic revolution In the relations between Aus tria and Hungary which might mean the reconstitution of the map of Europe. The question of the provisional aus gleich bill, (or agreement to prolong for a year, instead of ten years, the com pact between Austria and Hungary, pending the completion of arrangements for a longer compact, Is, if possible, a question even more grave than the threatened civil war. The Hungarian diet has given Baron von Gautsch von Frankenfhurn. tlhe Austrian premier, until Monday next in which to state whether he can reasonably expect the ausgleich bill to pass, and failing a de cisive answer, Baron Banffick, the Hun garian premier, will introduce, on Mon day, a bill whereby Hungary will act In dependently as regards the duties to be levied, continuance of commercial rela tions with Austria, and the renewal of the charter of the Austro-Hungarian bank. The compact between the two portions of the dual state thus lapses and, though the status quo may be main tained temporarily, Hungary will estab lish her claim to the right of independ ently disposing of these questions. It is easy to see that victory will only whet the Hungarians' appetite and that it will be but a short step to the dissolution of Austria, which in turn will hurl Europe into a funace of terrible possibilities. Apparently the only hope of escape Is that the personal ascendency of the old emperor will once again enable him to solve an apparently impossible situation. Failing in this, the reichsrath will - be dissolved and a reign of absolutism will begin in Austria and, technically, Hun gary will have resumed her independ ence. The Indian war continues on the old lines. The Britlslh advances and subse quent retirements leave but a small im pression on the tribesmen who will not submit. The whole warfare Is discourag ing as it promises to be inconclusive and looks as though the results might be summed up in a nut iihell bloody wax, weakened frontier, angered neighbors, thumping bill. The fact that the engineers' conference has ended in a fiasco is no surprise, though much regretted. The extreme gravity of the situation cannot be over estimated. The whole aspect of the in dustrial world is most depressing. In addition to the engineering troubles, the amalgamated society of railway servants . has issued strike notices to 120.000 of Its members and the cotton industry ia also threatened with paralysis. The con tending factions are adamant; the men utterly refuse to arbitrage. News From the Orient San Francisco, 4. The steamer City of Peking has arrived today from Yokoha ma and Hong Kong, bringing the fol lowing oriental advices: A serious riot occurred in Yokohama on the nig'ht or November 14Zh between about fifty inmates of the seamen's boarding house and a number of the workmen from the Yokohama dock yards. Sticks, stones, clubs and swords were freely used and many of the par ticipants were injured. At the request of the imperial univer sity the Japanese foreign office has in structed Minister Kato in London to en gage a professor on the science of ship building, in England. Fire destroyed over 400 dwellings at Omadhi, Awomari, on tho afternoon of November lltlh. On November 12th an attempt was made to blow up the railwray station at Riugashima, on the Hakuyetsu line, with dynamite. The station buildings, Iron bridge and other property were complete ly wrecked. No one was injured. Ten arrests have been made upon suspi cion. The recent ministerial crisis in Japan resulted in Count Okuma being relieved of his post of minister of foreign affairs and the appointment of Baron Nishi Tokubaro, a member of the" privy coun cil and formerly minister to Russia. It is reported in the Chinese press that Yank, secretary of the Tsung-Li-Yamen, 'has presented a striking memorial to the throne In connection with the advisabil ity of establishing gold coinage in China, It . Is asserted in all seriousness that the emperor has given his sanction to the propositiSfi, but The China Gazette, com menting upon the subject say9 that, see ing how little gold there is in China, the prospects of its being carried out are very slight. The Mobile Postofflce Fight Washington, December 4. Postmaster Rapier, of Mo'bile, Ala,, who refuses to vacate 'his office In favor of the man appointed to succeed him. will continue to hold office until a legal opinion on his rights can be pronounced. Postoffice In spector Tate has been instructed to re main at Mobile to await the action of the department, which has referred the mat ter to the law branch of the govern ment. A decision is expected early next week. The issue the postmaster has rais ed as to the power of the president to remove him until his term of office ex pires or until his successor is confirmed by the senate, department officials say is covered by the recent decision of the United States supreme court in Parsons vs. the United States. On the strength of this decision, they hold that Rapier's contention is unsound. There was a long conference over the case in Postmaster General Gary's office this afternoon between the postmaster general, fourth Assistant Postmaster Bristow, Assistant Attorney General Ty ner and Chief Postoffice Inspector Ham let. The conference, however, was with out Important result. Several ways of getting rid of the defying postmaster were discussed by civil process, by ar rest for obstructing the United States mail or for interfering with the United States marshal, by having the new ap pointee act as postmaster regardless of the other, or other means. It was be lieved, however, that Postmaster Rapier would yield possession by Monday and until then action has been suspended. Mnrders His lf TTIthont Cane Greensboro. N. C. December 4.

PARTING. The President Forced by Official Duties to Leave the Bed Side of Ills Dying; Mother. To Keturu as So.n as Possible. Canton, O., Decemoer 4. Sadder scenes were never witnessed than the leave taking of President McKinley from his dying "mother this afternoon. The carriage was early announced to convey him to the special car at the Pennsylvania depot, awaiting the ar rival of the regular eastbound train. But to the very last possible moment the president remained at the old homestead. Before leaving the house, he and other members of the family went to the bedside of the dying mother. He looked at her long, spoke to her lov ingly and stooped and tenderly kissed her. There was no response, no move ment to indicate that she recognized her son. He remained in a stooping posture for some time, hoping that he might receive some sign that she knew or felt his presence. It did not come. With feeling of deepest emotion he at last left the room. It was a strange coincidence that al most immediately following the de parture of the president the mother should suffer a relapse. Within half an hour after he left the city the ill ness of the mother took a turn for the worse. The attending physician declared it was a relapse which for a time threatened to extinguish the faintly flickering flame of life. Once more, however, the rugged constitution of. the aged woman withstood the as sault. She rallied slightly and ere long was gack to the condition in which she had been for nearly twenty hours, a condition of quiet and seemingly rest ful sleep, but which, it was fully re alised, was slowly burning out the vital spfixk of life. In that condition she was tonight. How long it might con tinue no one could tell. ."The president left Canton at 2:05 cffclock this afternoon. Judge Day, as sistant secretary of state, accompany ing him in a special car. Shortly before the departure he held a conference with the doctor, who advised that Mr. iMcKinley carry out the original plan of leaving for Washington. .He as sured the president that no act of a loving son or any other mortal could do anything for the aged mother, and that she would never again be able to Recognizer him or to realize his pres ence or ; absence. His 'last words to .the family were that he be telegraphed at every station along the route as to he moher's condition. The president has definitely arranged to return to Canton Tuesday morning, leaving Washington Monday as soon as he has completed his duties in con nection with the opening of congress. Mrs. McKinley will accompany him, as will also Mrs. Abner 'McKinley and rer daughter. Miss Mabel, of New York. .iThe near friends of the family are nearly, all at the homestead, " in cluding the surviving children, several grand children and Mrs. Abigail Os born, Mrs. McKInley's sister, and mother of William McKinley Osborn, consul general to London. She arriv ed last night too late to receive a sign of recognition. The North Carolina fonf-rence Raleigh, N. C, December 4. The morning session of the North Carolina Methodist conference today accepted an invitation to meet next year at Elizabeth City. The reports from the preachers was concluded. Rev. J. L. Bruce, a returned mis sionary from Brazil, spoke on the mis sion work of Methodism in that count ry. iln the afternoon the report on tem perance, favoring using every effort to have the injurious effects of alcoholic drinks taught in public schools was adopted. The Epworth League report recom mended an Epworth League and Sun day school conference. In the evening the report was read of the board of missions which was grati fying. 'An address followed by Rev. Dr. Atkinson, of Nashville, secretary of the Sunday school board of the M. E. church, south. The address was strong, emphasizing the fact that fhe Gospel of missions should be preached in contradistinction to the Gospel of collections. "Preach missions first," he said, "and let collections follow." The conference will make appoint ments Monday and then adjourn to meet at Elizabeth City next year. "So Immediate Chance to be Made in the Cabinet Washington, December 4. From the best obtainable information it appears that no change is to be made in the composition of the cabinet during the remainder of the current year. There are two good reasons for this. Attorney General McKenna has charged him self with the prosecution of the Pacific railroad cases and it is not to be sup posed that he will relinquish his pres ent office until the Kansas Pacific sale has passed into history. It is generally understood that Governor Griggs, of New Jersey, has been offered the place ia the cabinet to be vacated by At torney General McKenna, 'but it will not be possible for him to take the office before the 'beginning of next year. The New Jersey constitution fails to make provision for a lieutenant-governor and the successor to the gover norship would be the president of the state senate, who is limited In the as sumption of the office to the time when the lesrislaure is in actual session. which will not occur until January 1st. Should Governor Griggs relinquish his place now there, consequently, cculd be no head to the state government during the period of time between now and January 1st. and the governor is un willing to leave matters in such con dition.

FRANCE AROUSED OVER THE ATTEMPT TO REOPEN THE DREYFUS CASE The Press Fall of the Matter Everybody Mlxrd Up In the Affair from the I'ope tm Km perer William The Court-Martlal of Mjor Katerbaiy Ex pre ted to Turuw Light on the Ir-fue Caa Contention of the Opposing raciloae One Challeng the Result (Copyright by Associated Press.) Paris, December 4. All political and so cial interests continue to be merged in the case of Alfred Dreyfus, the former captain of French artillery, who is alleg ed to have been unjustly sentenced to im prisonment for life on the charge of hav ing sold important plans of the French war department to agents of a foreign power. Everything else Is neglected. The journals still devote endless columns in the biggest type to the affairs of Drey fus, his friends and enemies and every body in any way connected with the case. Everybody seems to be mixed up in the case, from the pope to Emperor William, of Germany, and syndicates and secret societies are said to be hard at work 6pending million on one side or the oth er and all France Is in the throes of an agitation which is unparalleled since the days of Danton and Robespierre. According to The Daily Telegraph, of London, of Thursday last, copies of which paper have been parsed around 1here by those interested in the subject, a "person who Is really behind the scene-." says: "Undoubtedly some per son or persons did get important facts regarding our (the French) military plans and communicated them to the German war office within a fortnight after the de cisions In question had been taken. If the extent -to w"nich this odius treason was committed and the results it has pro duced in a neighboring country where fully made known, I doubt whether, knowing my countrymen as I do, that they would remain satisfied with the punishment of one man. They would call for a radical change in the entire system and, possibly, for more. This guilt may be brought home to another, or to others, without necessarily establishing the innocence of Dreyfus, Who is lost be yond help and hope." The military governor of Paris, Gen eral Saussler, has ordered the formation of a court-martial to examine into the charges brought against Count Ferdi nand Walsin Ksterhazey (the retired ma jor of the French army who is accused of writing the letter which brought about the sentencing of Dreyfus to im prisonment for life), who Is alleged to have admitted the authorship of letters published by The Figaro recently, bit terly rellecting upon France and the French army. The Journal says that the decision of General Saussier is based on the report of General Pellleux, who wa. appointed by the minister of war to examine into the charges brought against Count Esterha zey, and w'hich is as follows: "So far as Dreyfus is concerned, the case has been tried, no new fact has been brought to light and no new document has been submitted during the course of the In quiry to justify a revision of the trial. In consequence, there is no ground for proceeding against Count Ksterhazey, so far as regards the crime of high treason, of which Alfred Dreyfus was con demned." Both sides profess to be pleased with the announcement. The antl-Dreyfu-sians contend that the order or Ucneiai Saussier cannot be construed as inj ply ing doubt as to the validity of the sen tence Imposed upon Dreyfus and that the Esterhazey Inquiry was not concerned with the Dreyfus case, but was merely a sequel of General Pelliuex. On the other hands the Dreyfusians assert that the inquiry will necessitate the introduction of expert evidence con cerning the 'hand-writing of the memo randum which convicted Dreyfus, priv ing it to be in Ksterhazey's handwriting a.nd they also proiose to introduce evi dence that documents, which were not submitted for the inspection of Dreyfus or 'his counsel at the time of his trial by court-martial were communicated to the officers composing the court. There seems to be no doubt that this was done, and lawyers who have been questioned on the subject say it invalidates the court-martial. The case of Dreyfus was discussed in the chamber of deputies today and oc casionally gave rise to heated utter ances. A good majority of the deputies, however, sustained the stand in the mat ter taken by the government. As a result of some hot words ex changed during the Dreyfus debate in the chamber of deputies today, Joseph Reinach, republican member represent ing the district of Digne, a well known newspaper man and author and editor of Republique Francaise, sent his sec onds to M. Millexand, . the well known socialist republican and editor of The Petite Republique Francaise. A duel with pistols has been arranged to take place between the men. To Make Gold and Greenbacks Inter changeable Washington, December 4. President McKirley in his forthcoming message to congress will not discuss in a sig nificant way the recent monetary ne gotiations of the Wolcott bimetallic commission, but will casually refer to it. The chief interest in the flnanc al part o his message will attach to a recommendation that gold ahali be paid only for. greenbacks and that greenbacks shall be paid only for golj. The president does not believe that, congress will retire the notes and It i his opinion that where there is a con stant surplus of receipts over expend itures and an exchange of gold and notes there is no longer any menace to the country. He does not contem plate the retirement of treasury notee, but only a change of classification, for the reason that, if retired, there would always be a talk of contraction of the currency, and he does not believe that if gold and greenbacks are made interchangeable and kept in a class by themselves, no danger need be appre hended from that source..

That may be safely prdictl. Talks w'hich the corespondent of the As sociated lre2it has had with tho lead ers of a majority of fhe parties make It evident that the opposition to the gov ernment's bills will not I overcome.

The Boersien Courier and other mod erate papers also condemn the tncasuro and predict Its failure. Home of the pa? pers, however, especially the conserva tive organs, uphold the naval bill. One of the government's arguments In the memorial accompanying the bill, b emigration. Reviewing the past flow to the I'nited States, It expnwises tho hopn that with a larger navy and a consequent larger sea trade this emigration may be? more largely diverted to tho German colonies.
