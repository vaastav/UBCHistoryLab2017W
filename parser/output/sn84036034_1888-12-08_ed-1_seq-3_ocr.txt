Every Alderman who desires to see order prevail in Butte, will be at his post of duty to-night. There should be no absentees. War on the New York sugar trusts was actively begun in New York, yesterday, by Gen. Roger A. Pryor on behalf of the people. It is to be hoped these combina tions against the people will be com pelled to go out of existence. What is Senator Frye's great anxiety to have the government settle this little financial difficulty with the Union Pacific road ? It is suspicious, to say the least. This stoppage of traffic on the Montana Union is a serious affair for Butte. It is likely to involve other Hues, also, and thus complicate difficulties. The ques tion is, should one or more men stand in the way of an immediate adjustment of the trouble? Should all our business interests be paralyzed through differ ences between employes of a concern like the Montana Union? There are enough honest, conscien tious Aldermen in the City Council to put their feet down on the sure-thing games. Stamp out the dives. The question this evening will ie: Shall the »ure-thing men flourish iu this city or not? The people say No. What do . the Aldermen say? Cleveland "PJaindealer": The mort gages on farms in Ohio, it is said, amount to more than $700,000,000, and are grad ually increasing, and this, too, in an old, well-developed, rich farming country. This condition of affairs has not been brought about by any natural but by an artificial cause—the present unequal and oppressive tariff. Cleveland has nearly 100,000 more votes than Harrison. And yet the lattei* is elected ! What a farce ! Whether the Republican party be lieves in civil service reform or the doc trine, "to the victors belong the spoils," is a point which a few months will be gin to develop. The Republicans have had much to say on this subject, during the past four years, and their loud pre tensions will now be put to a test. 

SHOULD BE SETTLED AT ONCE. The circumstances are to be regretted which brought about Tuesday's con flict between the officials and the em ployes of the Montana Union Railroad The difference is a most unfortunate one, however trivial it may seem to some. This morning The Miner publishes statements from the officials and from the employes, giving the version of each side in the controversy. It will be seen that the men do not blame Superintend ent Dickinson so much for what he does, as they do the influences which keep an objectionable man in a place where he is onabled to tyranizo over them and weed them out one by one. The management of the line has not properly supplied the officials with rolling material, the effect being that Superintendent Dickinson lias been compelled to do tho best he could with the stock at his command. This stoppage of traffic will be a seri ous blow at the industries iu this local ity. The great works at Anaconda de pend, from day to day, upon the trains from Butte for their ores, and nearly all the mines, mills and works hereabout depend upon the daily movements of the trains for their supplies of wood and coal. These points represent only one phase of the injury that must follow even a temporary stoppage of railroad traffic. All the industries of Butte are similarly inconvenienced. This trouble ought to be settled at ouce Not another hour's delay should be per mitted. The only time that any of the sure thing men were ever known to have lost was when, a few days ago, a bogus check for $200 was passed on some of them by a party who represented that he was a ranchman from Deer Lodge, and who, after "bucking" at their game, got his change in greenbacks and departed. The police force have enough to do to keep out of the city sneak tliieves and burglars, besides the ordinary run of police business without looking after the sure thing men. "Close them up." Outside cities and towns are driving their sneak thieves and sure-thing men out. Let our authorities "keep them on the move," too. The people of Butte look to the Coun cil for protection from the sure-thing men. The Council should not disap point them to-night. No half-way terms should be given any one who runs any sure-thing game or bunko joint. No license should be given for these robbing schemes. Sure-thing games create sneak thieves and burglars. Out with them. They must go. Let the Butte aldermen to-night do their duty. Let the Council give the order to our efficient police force, to close the sure thing dives, and tlie public need have no fear tor the result. Let the order be given. « a THE COUNCIL AND THE SURE-THING GAMES. The members of the Butte City Coun cil owe it to themselves, to their families, to their constituents and to the good name of the city to act firmly and justly to-night, in their dealing with the sure thing games. The people want to rid the city of this vice. It is the disgrace of the city. The ropers-in are on the alert to rob every miner, every ranchman, every woodman, and every individual who comes to town with a few dollars in his pocket. It is not creditable that the Aldermen of this city have not already given the long ago. The sore-thing gambling dens police authority to oust these prowlers are the breeding places of sneak-thieves, burglars, highwaymen and murderers. When the games are not paying well, the operators, or at least hangers-on of the games, sneak around the city daily as well as nightly, robbing all whom they can catch unawares, or openly assault people on the streets. It is high time the city authorities stepped iu and asserted their powers—if they possess any—and not only refuse to license new games, but direct the police to close up those now existing. 'Public opinion was so strong against the sure-thing men that the Council revoked the license of Tommy Rausch mann, last evening, for which that body has the thanks of the community. GILBERT, no doubt, Will have his gam- I bling license revoked, now that the Council haB its hand in. Alderman Lynch, at last evening's meeting, was evidently the daring fighter J of the meeting, not caring for the wrath | of the sure-thing gang. Every good Citizen Will honor Mr. Lynch in his action. Whether the adjustment yesterday made for the resumption of business over the Montana Union was for the purpose j of "letting ROSS out easy" or not, does I not so much concern the pablic as does tile fact that businees is likely to be re sumed over this line at once.

The Arrangements Proposed By the A naconda Company. I Tk® ®"srine*™' Case«« Represented- state I | | ment« by Superintendent Dickinson and the Men—The Anaconda Company Proposition Made in a Meeting at Miners' Union Hall—Its Tendency and Effect—Notes and Incidents of the Lay-off About 2 o'clock Tuesday afternoon blow ing of whistles in South Butte an nounced the fact that something unusual had transpired there, and the news quickly spread that the engineers and firemen of the Montana Union had struck. Numbers of people went down there at once to learn the cause of the strike and view the situa' tion. The yards at South Butte presented nothing unusual for observation. The only thing at all out of the way was the unusual stillness in place of activity. Only one switch engine was at work and it was en' gaged in hauling "dead" engines to the round house. None of the men on .strike were willing to talk about the affair then, but it was learned that they had a griev ance against Master Mechanic Ross on ac count of his arbitrary action in discharg ing some engineers without, as they re garded it, sufficient cause, About 1 p. m. Sheriff Lloyd went down to South Butte with about fifty special deputy sheriffs sworn in for the occasion {or the purpo8e °* s uardi!, s Uie company'« property ^" ^ruction. The deputies were stationed at various parts of the y ur( j i but apparently their services were not needed, as there was no interference w ' tb tbe road or its property by any one. The last train to go out from the South Butte depot was the 1:40 train for Garri SOD, which left on time. After that no othe / t . rai , a8 w , cnt ou 1 fc la8t f ven , inR -. or® tram for Anaconda was standing in the yard, but was not moved. The switch engine taking Ihedead engines into the round house was manned by Master Mechanic Ross himself and helper In the course of the afternoon the men on strike assembled in their hall at South Butte, where they were in session about two hours, but no result of public import came of their confereace - to I to ; tee at he I came of their confereace - superintendent Dickinson's statement. A visit was paid to the office of Superin tendent Dickinson on West Granite street [ in the afternoon and be was asked what was the cause of the strike. He said : 'It is confined to the engineers and fire J men of ^he Montana Union of whom there are about twenty-seven of each. The men -1 sent a committee to see me yesterday after I noon and handed me this list of grievances." He took a paper out of the drawer and banded ! fc ,*°. * he 1 ?Ç? rt S* B»«* from I the local division of the Brotherhood of Engineers at South Butte, and was ad J dressed to Master Mechanic Rose. It set forth the cases of John Meeks, Charles Be J Camp and Tom McLaughlin as requiring instant remedy. Attached to this was a resolution which set forth that the said I g rie .

He has made himself gen erally dieliked by all the engineers, and has acted inau CT b V trar 7 raannerwifcb tbemen ever since. He has been discharging men all along without cause.

His en gine climbed a ,r °g at Mill Creek, which is a comm ° n occurrence, and not his fault. It wae a fault in the track, or the engine up his itself, and he was in no way to blame. Ross discharged him next day when he re ported for duty without any cause being assigned. He didn't want to make any protest over it, so tool: his discharge and left. "Another engineer named Hite was dis cha.rged for running into a car left on a Y, anti being on the wrong side of the curve he couldn't Bee it, and the fireman didn't happen to notice it. He was dis charged without trial. ' "An engineer named Fitzgerald laid off when he was sick. He was called to go ont, but wan unable to go, and was dis charged. "Haslitt, one of the oldest and beBt en gineers in the service, was discharged' for knocking oat a cylinder head, a case oc curring every day. The piston head work ing loose on the piston knocked it out. He couldn't see that a piece of machinery in an enclosed box was out of order. "Then Bentley was discharged for refus ing to do another man's work in turning his engine on the Y at Anaconda. It was the work of a hostler and not his duty. "Landers, Fisher and Johnson bad to quit because their places were made so dis agreeable for them that they could not work under Ross. "John Meeks had been working steadily for three nights and two days with only four hours' sleep. He was played out,asked for a lay-off and got it. The agreement we have with the company says that the men ahull be the judges of their fitness for going to work, but a man who can't work thirty-six hours on a stretch without stopping is no account. A caller was sent for Meeks next morning to run a switch engine when his own engine waein the round house ready to go out. He agreed to go out on his own engine but re fused to go out on the switch engine and for that he was discharged. You under stand that when a man has an engine he be comes accustomed to it just as a man does with a team of horses, and he comes to understand its workings and takes liking to it. But Ross discharged him as I tell you. McLaughlin's case was this: He wae the engineer on tho switch engine, which caused the death of a switchman in the South Butte yard a few nights ago. His feelings were so unstrung by the occurrence that he didn't feel safe to run an engine, and asked Roes to get another man to run his engine. He did-so, and then discharged McLaughlin "I wae refused the rights I was entitled to under the agreement with the company. I asked for a rest after thirty-six hours work, and Ross said that would set me back on the line of promotion. I appealed to Superintendent DickinsoD, and the lat ter decided that I should get my passenger engine. These are only a few of th e in stances of Ross' arbitrary action." "When did you decide or your recent action?" "On Sunday night we had a meeting at which it was decided to draw up a. set of grievances ou tho cases of Meeks, McLaugh ; in and myself. That was the first paper you saw at Superinlendent Dickinson's office. A committee waited on Ross Mon day morning and he refused point blank to make any concession. Then the commit tee consisting of \V. F. Bieunan, chairman; myself, secretary; R. O. B. Stoddard, John Meeks. G. A. Cross and Pat Meeks went up at 10 o'clock to Mr. Dickinson's office and waited until uooh without seeing him. We left word we wanted to see him, and went back at 2 o'clock and presented the paper we gave Roes, together with the resolution passed at a meeting after Ross had refused to do us justice, asking his re moval. Mr. Dickinson granted all our re quests except that McLaughlin be rein stated unless he would retract something he had said. We then asked him to discharge Ross. We laid before him three times ns many cases ol Ress' action I have Ress' arbitrary action as I have given you and put the matter very plainly before him. Mr. Dickinson said that if we could prove that Ross had been arbitrary and unjust toward the men he would remove him. We thought we had doneso by citing him these instances. We gave Mr. Dickin son until 10 o'clock this morning for an answer. He said he cou'd answer there and then and would not consider that last article as to dismissing R-ss. "A union meeting was held on Monday evening, at which the committee reported their action and asked to be discharged. The meeting refused to do so, and we were further instructed to go to Mr. Dickinson this morning and tell him that unless Ross was remov^ from the office of M™r chanic the men would quit the service of the company. It was the sense of the meeting that matteiB, so far as Ross was concerned, had come 1o a crisis. They were simply being discharged piecemeal for no offence, one at a time, and they felt they might as well go in a body altogether at a time when work was good." "What do you suppose was Ross' object in his arbitrary action?" Rosa'object has all along been to discharge Brotherhood men. He has threatened time and again to make all the oid men go some time or other. He wants to get scabs un der him, men whom he can handle as he pleases, and whom he would not have to treat according to Brotherhood rules That's the whole secret of his action as it appears to me." "Now, that you have struck, what are you going to do?" "This is not a strike," answered Mr. De Camp, positively. "T»e engineers and fire men have simply quit the service of the company as long as that man Ross is office. The company is perfectly welcome to get any one to run their engines they can, but ws won't. We calculate to be orderly and intend to keep away from the yards of the company. There is no occa sion, so far as we are concerned, for all these men as deputy sheriffs down there, They may as well go home. We have closed up with the company, have severed our connection with it and expect to re ceive in good time what is coming to us." "Did Mr. Dickinson not state to you his intention of removing Ross before you asked him to?" "Mr. Dickinson did state this morning privately to us that Ross' removal had been under contemplation, but would give us no definite assurance that he would eventually do so." "So that your grievance is only ön ac count of Ross?" "Just as I have told you. He has been removing men one by one, and we con eluded to go altogether, while we can get work elsewhere. Work is good everywhere at this season, but if we waited until Ross discharged us oue by one we might get thrown out when work is dull. We have only the kindliest feelings toward Mr. Dickinson. He has always tried to it v Dickinson. He has always tried to do what is right by the men from the first day he came to the rotjd. But what use was it to have our grievances righted by Mr, Dickinson to have them overriden by Ross? That's our position, and I hope you will do us the justice to place us in our true light before the public." THE SITUATION. The public have what facts before them that could be collected on tho subject from the side of the road and of the men who quit. The fact remains that the Montana Union is tied up on account of the con tinuance in its service of one man who has rendered himself obnoxious to tbe em ployes under him. In speaking to other railroad employes about it, their general reply was that if they were Ross' shoes and their employes made it a point that they should go out if he remained, they would step up to Mr. Dickinson's office and haud in their resignation. "And if he hasn't got enough money to go out of town on he could go to any of the mine men and put his case before them and they would give him ?500 rather than have this occur." The stoppage of the Montana Union means the stoppage of the trains that take the coal and other supplies to the mines and mills of the camp. This means the shut down of these mines and mills until the Montana Union can bring tiiem supplies and take away their ore. The Alice has enough of salt to get along with, but no supply of coal on hand, and willshutdowD. The Mountain Consolidated laid oS its men last night, and so it will be with all the others on the hill. Their ore bins will not contain more than a day's work, and. unless relieved by the railroad taking itjaway all the time, have no place to put it. Thus, all the miners iu tbe camp, it may be said, are stopped in their work on account of one man who persists in remaining in a posi tion that entails this loss upon others, outside of his business. The engineers and firemen who have refused to continue at work under him have the right inherent in every man to quit work whenever he pleases, and there are few men among them but is able to lay off at present and go elsewhere seeking work. 

TO-DAY'S PROGRAMME. A Montana Union official stated to a reporter last evening that the 8 o'clock train for Garrison will leave this morning asusua). Master Mechanic Ross telegraphed up to inquire if there was any objection to his taking out the train himself and was answered that there was none. The train from Garrison last night was in charge ol Engineer Maynard who is anon-union man OD U B way to Anaconda Tuesday night at and who is expected to side with the road in the present emergency. The Northern Pacific east-bound last night waa two hoars late which delayed the train in its arrival here. Should he refuse, however, to go out this morning, Master Mechanic Ross will take the train out. This, however, is the only train that I be official thought would leavo to-day from South Butte over the Montana Union. As to the Union Pacific und Northern Pacific trains, railroad men seem to have no doubt of their right to send their trains into Butte, so that all uppreheusions o! being cut off from outside communication is groundless. One cause of the trouble on the Mon taua Union has been the lack of rolling stock, which has kept the road back all alon^ and forced the men to handle engines that were really unserviceable. 

WEDNESDAY. The tie-up on the Montana Union continues unchanged. The yards at South Butte are at a standstill with freight ac cumulating in them. The Sheriff had twenty-four men on duty as Deputy Sheriffs and has been on duty there Inins If irom 1 o'clock Tuesday', only coming up to town for his meals. The yards are kept clear of stragglers and every precaution is taken to protect the property there as much in the interest of the engineers and firemen who have quit work, as of the company. The only act of violence, so far, was the DITCHING OF A TRAIN a place called Thompson's Spur, about a Stole this side of Anaconda. The train had come down from Garrison in charge of En gineer Maynard and was run up to Ana conda, about half-past 10 p. m. after arriving at Stuart. It contained the North ern Pacific eastbonnd mail of Tuesday and wae then two hours late. On arriving at Thompson's Spur three men were seen by the light of the headlight to jump into a wagon and ride off. A second later the train was ditched by the misplacement of a switch. The men who got away in the wagon were undoubtedly the miscreants. WHAT THE ENGINEERS SAY. Speaking to some of the engineers in Butte about this last night they said they could not see any cause for it as Maynard is a Brotherhood man and had taken his engine out before the order to quit had been given; besides, being on a mail train, be bad to take it through, and as he was just completing his run it was no one in sympathy with the engineers who did this us it was mere wanton malice. The engin eers at Anaconda would do all they could to discover the perpetrators of the out rage. It was not done by any of them, the men here said, and they could account for the whereabouts of every engineer and fire man on the road at the time the occurrence happened. Several of thosespoken to said thas the viliains who would ditch a passen ger train ought to be hung as soon as caught. They claimed that they had noth ing whatever to do with it, although they heard it set down to the strikers the first thing yesterday morning. THE LABOR UNIONS TAKE A UAND. In the course of the day an effort was made by the labor unions of the city to en deavor to adjust tho matter. A public meeting was held at South Butte at 3 p m. at which were present a number of the members of the Miners' Union, Knights of Labor, railroad men and others. The meeting was very orderly and there was no expited language used or permitted. The, result of this meeting was the appointment of a committee of labor union and railroad men to visit Mr. Dickinson and present the case to him of the community in general consequence of the tie-up and to ask him to discharge Master Me chanic Ross or give some assurance that lie would be discharged. The committee were in session for nearly two hours with Mr. Dickinson, without any satisfactory re sult. Mr. Dickinsou told them that the matter was out of hie hands, as he had telegraphed to the authorities at St. Paul and Omaha, asking to be relieved, and to have s ,me one sent; on immediately to take hold of matters. The committee retired ^ Witb ° Ut a " y 

SUPERINTENDENT DICKINSON RESIGNS. Mr. Dickinson was seen at the conclusion of the conference an! asked what the present situation was. He said: "The sit uation is practically unchanged. I have just had a conference with a delegation of railroad and labor union men who asked mo to discharge Ross. I told them the matter was out of my hands and I have telegraphed to the authorities at St. Paul amt Omaha, asking to be relieved and to have some one sent here to succeed me. saw this trouble coming all along anti have done my best to avert it but unsuccessfully We have some of the best engineers on this road that I ever had working under me, but there are some of them who no amount of concession or conciliation can manage. As Mr. Potter said when he sent me here, I was sent to organize a dis organized road. I have tried my utmost to do so, but must confess I have failed and consequently I have tendered rnÿ res ignation. Nearly every case the men cited to- you yesterday as instances of Ross' injustice I ordered myself, and Ross was simply carrying out my orders, as he was hired to do. Iu consequence of the [ires ence of those factious spirits anioDg the engineers to whom I have referred, it is im possible to adjust the present difficulty. With them removed, I venture to eay the opposition to Ross would d>e out, and everything. would be workiug smoothly again. I regard Ross as a faithful etn ploje, and I cannot remove him on such demand as that made to me." ' tet you said you regarded him as too high tempered for the position and intended to replace him. Did you tell tho men so? "J told them just as I have told you that it was in contemplation to have him re placed as soon as I could make arrange meats to do But meats to do so. But I could not comply with a demand to have him removed at an hour's notice " 'If the men who have now quit were to offer to go back to work on that under standing, would their services be accepted?" "All but a few of them. If the gentle men who come here cannot adjust the mat ter I intend to ask for the chiefs of the Brotherhood to come here and investigate the matter. Thj men say, as you reported that they have no grievance against me, and yet every act which they specified as complaints against. Ross is mine. "Do you suppose they are aware of this?" "I think they are." "If you were to replace these men with other engineers do you apprehend there would be any trouble?" I am sure there would be. It is a Brotherhood matter and I don't, suppose any Brotherhooit men would take their places. But I don't thinktheBrotherhood will sustain them. I feel confident that every one who is unprejudiced will sustain my position. Ross has carried out my in ructions and I can't discharge him for that. But, as I said, the matter is out of my hands now and I am simply waiting for the arrival of the men who will come here in answer to my telegrams to head quarters." "When will these parties arrive?" "I expect them here by Friday," "And until then there will be no change in the situation." "Not that I can see at present." 

MEETING AT MINEH8' UNION HALL. At 8 o'clock Wednesday night a public meeting was held at Miners' Union Hall. meeting was held at Miners' Union Hall. hich was filled with representatives from all the labor unions, railroad men and. busin ss men in general. President Norris called the meeting to or der and stated the object for which they were assembled which was to hear from the representatives of ibe railroad men who had quit their side of the case and also to receive the report of the committee who had visited Superintendent Dickinson in the afternoon. He introduced Secretary Do Camp of the Firemen's Brotherhood. Mr. DeCamp entered into a statement of their troubles with the master mechanic of the Montana Union, going into details more extensively than those he gave to the re porter of The Miner on Tuesday, and ex plained the reasons why the engineers and firemen quit the employment of the road. Treasurer Deeney of the Butte Miners' Union followed, giving an account of the committee's interview with Superintendent Dickinson and the unsatisfactory result of it. On motion of W. J. Penrose a commit tee was appointed to invite Mr. Dickinson to attend the meeting to explain his posi tion and see if some arrangement could not be made with him, with which under standing an adjournment of half an hour was taken. When the committee returned President Norris announced that they had been una Me to find Mr. Dickinson, but that henn derstood Mr. Carrol! of the Anaconda was pany had an important communication to '"Mu Carroll announced that the Anaconda Company proposed to man ten engin« ol the Montana Union to take supplies to the mines of the company and run the ora cars to the smelter provided there would be no obstruction. They would put Chief Engi neer Cole of the Anaconda in charge of their engines at the depot with the understand ing that they had nothing to do with any thing else except their own freight and sup plies. The Anaconda Company had no intention of interfering with the passenger or general freight business, but would simply confine themselves to supplying their own mines and tbe smelter. Master Mechanic Ross was to have nothing to do with this arrangement. President Norris called on tbe representa tives of the engineers and firemen preseut to state whether, in the interest of the peo ple of Butte, they would offer any obstruc tion to such an arrangement. Engineer Sweeney, on behalf of the engi neers, asserted that no engineer would in terferewith the arrangement. They went out because Master Mechanic Ross wss not removed, Dad quit the service of the road and would put a hand to nothing as long as he was in the employment of the road. Secretary De Camp, on behalf of the Brotherhood of Firemen, said they had no objection to the Anaconda Company oper ating the entire Montana Union. The fire men did not own a bolt or u nut on the road and had nothing to say as to who should operate the road. They hoped the company would be successful and would jjlace no obstruction in their way, but so long as they were free agents they would not work and* r Ross. His remarks and those of his., predecess ors evoked loud cheers and the general feeling was one of exultation that the way to a compromise had been found at last The meeting then adjourned. 

INFERENCES AND CONJECTURES. Superintendent Carroll was approached after the meeting and asked what kind of engineers the company proposed to man the Montana Union engines with. "We have in our employ several old Union Pacific engineers who are still mem bers of the Brotherhood of Locomotive En gineers.. We will use ten engines and these men at work on them to bring supplies of fuel and timber to our mines and to carry ore and other supplies to the smelter at Anaconda. But these men are to be exclu sively under the direction of Chief Kngineer W. G. Cole, and Master Mechanic Ross will have nothing to do with them." "Then you don't intend to operate the Montana Union?" "No, no," said Mr. Carroll emphatically, "nothing of the sort. All we incend to.do is to keep our mines and smelter running. We shall have nothing to do with the freight or passenger traffic of the Montana Union." "But under the promise of noninterfer ence made by the representatives of the engineers and firemen who have quit, you could operate the road if you wanted to?" "Yes, they sail as much." "And under the new condition you are at liberty to employ any of those engineers and firemen who have quit the service of the Montana Union?" "I suppose we can. There is nothing to prevent us doing so." It will thus be seen that there is nothing to interfere with a complete resumption of work on-the road, Master Mechanic Ross be.ng practically retired into the back ground. There is no reason why the Alice, the Parrot and all the other companies here cannot follow the example of the Ana conda and engage engineers to run engines of the Montana Union and furnish them selves with supplies. Talking the matter over with a railroad agent, the latter said: "Daly is going to run the Montana Union for them and that will end the matter. Under the statements made by lh-.- men there is nothing to pre vent him. He can engage all these en gineers and firemen that have quit and put Cole down at the yards as master mechanic and that ends it. All the men want is to have Ross removed and this offer of Daly includes that provision. It is simply an easy way out of a very ticklish position, and for my part lam glad to see it, although I don't think the men really had any grievance against Ross. He is a good mechanic and understands his business, and was faithful to the road, but it will never do to allow one man to shut up the business of Butte, and he has got to go. This simply lets him down quietly, and you will see the road running all right in a day or so." Eliot Held for the Grand Jury. Missoula, Mont., December 3. —[Special to the Miner.—Thomas Eliot, charged with butchering cattle not his own, waived ex amination to day, and was held in bail to await the action of the grand jury.

Washington, December 3.— Both houses of Congress re-assembled this noon. The galleries were filled with spectators. At 12:30 the house took a recess for an hour, and at 12:47 the Senate adjourned for half an hour. The President's message was read in both branches in tbe afternoon, eliciting rounds of applause from the Dem ocrats and derisive laughter from tbe Re publicans. Where Women Are Barred. Denver Tribune: While talking on this I subject it may be interesting to say that I' there is a mine near Leadville into which women are never admitted. If a woman H were permitted to enter this mine I believe I B every last man on the premises would quit * work. The mine had an accident for every woman who has visited it. Immediately woman who has visited it. Immediately after a woman has been admitted some mishap, with damage to property or life, has followed. Hence the superstition of the miners. Sensation in Masonic Circles. London special: A sensation has been created iu Masonic circles by the develop ment of the fact that in a Scottish lodge two ladies were recently secreted by the acting Past Master in a place where they could secure a full view of the ceremony of 'tyling" the lodge in the third degree. In some manner the affair leaked out and the grand lodge of Scotland, which has just been sitting as a. court of investiga tion, has decided to ignominiously expel the offender.
