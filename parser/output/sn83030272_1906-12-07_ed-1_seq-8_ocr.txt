CLEMENCEAU hasjust just given the strongest possible assurances ances of pacific intentions The onlyother 4 other European country with which itIs L Is concelvablo that Germany shouldbecome become embroiled is Great Britain Inthe the event of a contest however betweenthe the British and German empires thoattempt attempt to safeguard tho German mercantile cantile marine by placing It under theAmerican American flag would ho looked upon inLondon London ns an unfriendly act on ourpart 1 part and our relations with Great Britainmight might he seriously affectedWe We attach no credit to the suggestionthnt that President 

ROOSEVELT may haveentered entered into such an agreement with theGerman German Emperor The former knowsthat that our commerce with Great Britainis is of far more importnnco than il ourtrade trade with Germany and that it wouldbo bo an act of folly to imperil tho formerfor l for tho sake of preserving intact tholatter latter Our own belief is that tho willingness evinced WILLIAMto ingness by Emperor WILItMt to strain to tho utmost his executiveauthority t exeutveauthority the Germantariff authority by suspending Gerantrlt tariff in our favor in duo to no definitebargain 1 bargain but to his general desire whichof of lat has been exemplified in manyways ways io win the good will and confidence fidence of the American peoplo He hascertainly certainly succeeded in bringing abouta a notable change of sentiment on thisBide 5 Bide of the Atlantic I cannot indeedbe be said that even yet we regard Germanywith with O much sympathy as we do England i I land but we now exhibit scarcely a traceof of the apprehension and suspicion withwhich which we used to watch the foreign andcolonial use ant colonial policy of tho Berlin Government meat Wo have become pretty wellconvinced It I convinced thnt tho German Emperor hasrenounced renounced if he ever entrtine thev Â± a I hope of gaining a foothold in the Caribbean bean or on the coast of Brazil Eventho the design which at one time he 8suppo supposed to cherish of extending hissphere sphere of influence in China from Kiaochou chou over tho whole of the great province ince of Shantung seems now t havobeen been abandonedWo Wo are convinced that Emperor WILLIAM TAM will not allow the work of conciliation tion which ho has prosecuted so ton ha proMcut 1 patiently tiently and successfully to be broughtto to naught by a tariff war He must seethnt that Mr ROOSEVELT whatever may bohis his personal wish i powerless at thistime time to obtain the assent of our FederalSenate Senate to the changes in the Dingloytariff tariff which German exporters desireHe He must recognize that the utmostpossible possible concession which lies withinthe the power of our Executive is confinedto modifications of existingcustoms to some moifctons our exsthlcustomsre customs regulations Evidently all theEmperor Emperor asks of us i that we should dowhnt what we can to afford him a show ofjustification justification for employing his influenceand and authority to secure a further extension sion of the present provisional arrangement ment under which only the minimumrates rates of the German tariff are imposedon on imports from the United StatesMr Mr Roosevelt on CubaThe The President covers the Cuban situation tion admirably He reviews the experience ence of the last four month showing thocauses and the of interventionHe causes process IntrventionHe He leaves tho time and the conditions ofthe the restoration for determination by theconduct conduct of the Cuban peopleThis This is as it should b Any specificpledges pledges at this time would be a seriousmistake mistake Wo must understand and mustgive givo our Cuban wards clearly to understand stand that M tho United States has assumedthe I the sponsorship before tho civilized worldfor for Cubas career oa a nation We havounderwritten underwritten any Government which mayhereafter hereafter b established in the islandIn In our own interest in the interest ofalien alien residents and investors and in theinterest interest of tho Cubans themselves wo arebound bound whatever tho time required tohold I hold the control of tho island until thereis is n reasonable assurance that whentheir their new Government is started it shallnm nm smoothly and with freedom fromflagrant flagrant denial of right on the one handand and from insurrectionary disturbanceson on the otherThe The President states that his proclamation tion of a provisional Government was anact act Mln accordance with the socalledPlatt Platt Amendment The point i not ofvital vital importance but a similar error hasalready already been made the basis of sharpcriticism criticism of the Administration for itsconduct conduct in the Cuban affair The Amendment ment declares that Cuba consents thattho tho United States may exercise the rightto to intervene Ac The point has beenraised raised that tho use of the term UnitedStates States would call for action by Congress gross and leave no right of action to thePresident President or any other individualTho The Presidents authority to act doesnot not come from tho Amendment itselfbut but from the treaty of July 1904 forwhich which provision was made in Article VIIIof of the Amendment By that conventionthe the right Oof intervention was made apartomaninternational part of an international treaty and therefore fore subject to Executive actionAn An Echo From the YellowIn In one part of his vigorous and eloquent quent message to Congress the President dent has kindled what promises to flameinto I into a very lively and instructive

a constanttheatregoer theatregoer in New York city I have seenscores scores of plays where the villain was a villainfor for fair and where the usual moral 8 setup up for the guidance and protection of womencomely comely and of all ages below 80 but I havenever never seen a play where the plot looked tothn the protection and guidance of men fromthe Ithe the wiles of women In this town there aramany many adventuresses I am told who posittheir their days nnd nights planning blackmailcitizens citizens good bad and Indifferent Manyof of these women am Ingenuity personifiedMany Many of them are beautiful and Insinuatingclever clever and with charming manners Mereman man stupid man blunder headed man butwithal withal good sometimes becomes the victimof of these dangerous womenWhy Why not advocate a play pointing out tomen men comely and of all ages below 80 theconsequences consequences of being entrapped by thesesirens sirens In other words why should therenot not be a play written pointing out morals formen men as well 8 for women H J TNEW NEW YORK December 8Tollman Tollman Berth FittingsTo To TUB EDITOR or Tin scNvSlr Having hadoccasion occasion at various times recently t
