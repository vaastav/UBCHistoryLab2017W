Japanese farmers are said to be pourio into this country from Mexico. Japan ia Bald to be colonizing Hawaii with men of military experience. The president urges improvement of tbe army and navy but falls to mention river improvement, or, In fact, any form of Internal Improvement. Tbe very first recommendation of tbe president's message,, to make it unlawful for corporations to con tribute to political campaign funds, appears to be a joke In tbe light ot the promotion of Corte'.ycu to tbe secretaryship of the treasury. Jeff Davis of Arkansas has caused to be introduced In coneress a bill mn kint; it a felony to deal In futures.

Straus Tbe declsiou of tbe Missouri Su preme Court in regnrd to the race track law need not afford comfort to the friends of race track: (rambling This thing Is dead to Missouri. Two years or the old 1 i was enough to persuade the people of the corrupting character of the race tracks main tained by the aid of the law. Tbe people tried it in good faith and found it bad. And now tbey are not going to have it. People, of course, can bet on races just as much as they ever could. Cut ser'es of million dollar race tracks built and owned by professional gamblers and operated nearly the whole year for a criminal profit which the state enabled them to collect are things of tbe past. - One of tbe hardest political problems in tbe state today is how Mr. Herbert Hadley is to retard the progress of the maximum freight rate bearing and the Standard Oil prosecu tion so as to serve the interests of hit gubernatorial boom. It is proposed in Oklahoma to determine the exact geographical center of the new state and locate tbe capltol there tbe state to own and lay out tbe town site and to raise the revenue for the capltol building by tbe sale of lots. Kansas City is agitating the question of requiring the saloons to close their doors at midnight. Most of the more reputable saloons close their doors about this time, and tbe others are said to be places of refuge for the crooks wan give the police tbe most trouble. Ibe Christmas number of the Century magazine contains a short article by James J. Hill, president of the Great Northern railway, in advocacy of tbe establish aient in every agricultural county in the United States of a model farm of forty acres, a local experiment station, under the superintendeocy of the highest scientific skill obtain able. Mr. Hill says that this could be done at the cost of a siDgle battle Bbip and that it must result in greater good than a whole navy. Mr. Hill approves of the work of the depart meot of agriculture but be believes that tbe location of small stations in every agricultural community would briu niucrureauits and bring these results more quickly. He believes that the prejudice among farmers atrainst agricultural experimentation would be obviated by having these demonstrations made locally Instead of being roported in bulletins Issued from distant stations. One of the first bills introduced in congress this we k was a graduated income tax bill. The very first thing Senator Penrose resolution requesting the president to give congress full information as to the discharge of three negro companies of infantry. The president unbosomed himself to congress on tbe subjects of indus trial education, dl voro, child bearing, lynching and several other matters of much interest wholly out of the province of the federal government under the constitution. The next legislature promises to be a reform legislature, and no more important reform could engage tbe attentions of that body tban such modification of tbe rules of criminal practice as would insure speedy trials, especially in the case of the graver classes of felonies. There Is no greater Bhame on civilization in America tban the law's delay. A resolution has been Introduced in tbe Oklahoma constitutional con vention favoring state ownership ot mineral lands No state in this country has adopted this theory But the Roman government derived a large part of its revenue from mines and tbe present governments of Southern Europe treat mineral property as Btate monopolies. The State Board of Charities and Corrections at a meeting in Jefferson City this week reelected Its present officers.

Nearly all of it appears to be addressed to the public rather tban to congress. The admirers of the president will find leasoa for this in the alleged fact that Mr. j Roosevelt feels himself to be thej leader and champion ot tbe people battling for their cause against a reluctant congress. He speaks to his constituents over congress' head, with what purpose, in some instances, it Is bard to understand, since no legislation is either recommended or coniempiatea. uis remarks on lynching, on capital and labor, on corporations, on divorce, and on several other subjects are to be taken as lay oci Uiuiio. He bad some Ideas which he wanted to get before the country and he to k this occasion to reach the people But not all of the message is of this character. The president makes some very specific and very important recommendations to the legislators. One of these Is to give the government the right of appeal in criminal cases. Another Is shorter hours for railroad employees. Another is the with drawal of government coal lands from homestead entry. Another is in egard to inheritance and incotre tax. The president is not very specific upon this last subject, but he leaves no room for doubt about his belief in the desirableness of legislation upon these mutters and be reinforces a statement of his position by the best specimen of argumentation in the whole message. lie Is brief but positive in his recommendation of ship subsidy, of conferring citizen ship upon tbe Porto Rlcans, and of tree trade with tbe Philippines. On the paclfio coast Japanese qnestion the president does his very worst, ne Is exceedingly overbearing aod offensive in his ODinions upon this subject. He writes like a man who had lost his temper and did not know what be was saying. In impassioned declamation he says in effect that when a president makes a promise which he has no authority to make in tbe name of the nation, that the rights of the states, the constitution nor anything should avail to stand in tbe way of tbe keeping of the nation's faith, that 1, the president's unauthorized promise. The message closes with words of praise for the army and navy And In spite ot the president's extraordinary actions In the Scbley, Funston and Pershing cases it u Just to say that great credit Is due to him for the improved spirit In both of these branches of the service. be n incorporated in platforms ot party principles It Is quite certaiu that delegates to state conventions whlcb have adopted such platforms have not had tbe information which would jostify such an action rn the part of t he legislature, and It is doubt ful whether the legislators who contemplate Introducing such bills have such Information, Undoubtedly, if the transportation of passengers can be profitably done and in proper comfort and decency on a rate of two cents per mile, then the fare ought to be changed. Anrl It is extremely probable that on most of tbe best trunk lines a fare of two cents per mile would be found remunerative. But the law would have to be uni form, and it it is not at all probable that the branch lines would break even In the matter of passenger trans portatlon on a two cent basis It requires more expert knowledge tban Missouri legislators are usually credited with having determine the justice of this proposed legislation. The matter at least ought to be re ferred to a commission for careful Investigation. The tact tbat rail mar's are high-banded to their treatment of the public has nothing to do with tbe proposition. A state cannot aff rd ever to be vindictive. Unless V should prove tbat the present rates are unnecessarily high. The red op tion of rates would necessarily result Id diminishing the number of traiu- and reducing the quality of the ser vlci. There are railroad abuses in abundance which can be corrected and which require no expert know ledge on the part of legislators The maintenance of passenger stations of a character comporting favorably with tbe ticket sale is one of them Tbe wbole pass bus1 cess ought to be done away with. The railroad bus iness is Dot a private business and railroads no more than postoffices can show favor without doing injustice. There are many ample propositions like these oo which the legislators could not possibly go astray and which would prove more certain relief to the public v it iidiitl)
