Representative from the Seventh dis trict had been notified that they might as I well draw up stakes and quit trying to get the nomination because Mr Crokcr had decided that he would have Perry Belmont nominated The election Is to be held on January 7 The voters down on Staten Island say that they do not like the idea of having Mr Croker select their candidate for them and that they want a chance to say some thing about it themselves Police Commissioner Murphy said today that the nomination had been offered him I thought a young and active man should get It said Colonel Murphy and 1 posi tively refused to accept It What do ou think of Perry Beltaont I dont know Mr Belmont was the reply I think and hope tho nomination will go to some young man In the dis trict FRENCH FIGHTING

penditure Boliovos 87500000 Enough Commissioner Macfar land Surprised The Secretary or the Treasury has offi cially frowned upon the estimates sub mitted by the Commissioners for the ex penses of tho District during the next fiscal year It will be recalled that the Commission ers after a careful canvass of the mat ter and after full consideration of the needs of the departments individually and severally forwarded to the Secretary of the Treasury for transmission to Con gress a schedule of estimates aggregat ing 104t8197 llnlf Million Alio c Lnt Year This sum is about 550000 in excess of the amount asked for a year ago Con gress after going over last years esti mates in committee and on the floors of the House and Senate finally appropri ated for the curent fiscal year Including the expenses of tho Water Department S10760S97 It has been customary for the Secretary of the Treasury to pass the estimates of the Commissioners on to Congress with out amendment or comment though it Is within the purvey of his authority to ex press his views relative to them Secre tary Gage therefore has assumed a new role and in recommending that the esti mates be cut down to the figure of 7 500000 has invited the wrath of the citi zens associations of the District for all time to come The thunders of eloquence which may be expected to follow thi3 attempt at re trenchment will probably reverberate through the corridors of the Treasury Building before the showers of April bless the flowers of spring Secretary Gago offers the following ex planation for his unexpected recom mendation Secretnrj Snu es Mnfement In view of the considerable actual in debtedness of the District of Columbia amounting on June JO 1001 to J71C15o27 and Its probable further Increase under laws already enacted to 1300000 on June 30 1S02 exclusive of items chargeable to the District of Columbia for extension of streets for highway bridge across Po tomac River and for Baltimore and Ohio Railroad terminals the Secretary of the Treasury withholds his approval of the estimates as submitted by the Commis sioners for the fiscal year 1003 and rec ommends that they be reduced to J7 500000 one half of which Is equal to the estimated revenues of the District for the same period The reduction thus proposed will op erate to bring appropriations for support of the District within the restrictions pro vided by existing law The revenues raised by the District during the last fiscal year exclusive of water taxes amounted to 338466290 the amount estimated for the current fiscal year Is placed at J3500C00 and there Is no apparent Indication that the rev enues for the next fiscal year will ex ceed the estimate of 3750000 Commissioner Mncfnrlitnd urprlned Commissioner Macfarland was consid erably surprised yesterday when inform- eu oi me uuuuu ui Ltiuiarj uue uu admitted that the Secretary had acted wholly within his prerogative in offering his suggestions to Congress Mr Macfar land said he hoped that the Commission ers would be able to so present the case that the Dlntrict would secure such ap propriations as it needs The Commisslonercalled attention to the statement of the Board which prefaces the estimates submitted by them to the Sec retary a part of which reads The Commissioners followed this vcar as last In making up the estimates for Congress cf the appropriations Heeded for the next fiscal year the policy of asking for what is really necessary regardless of the possible deficit due to be diversion of District funds by Congress to street extension purchases Tho growth of the District means an increase In Its needs All Its services require larger appropria tions naturally from jear to year Be sides this we must complete projects and begin new ones for

Conference opened this morning Senor Brez made a long speech which was a sort of a general discussion of the conferences duties and opportuni ties including some exposition of Para guays idea of

by providing that the location of the bank bo not necessarily In New York Senor Augusto Matte of Chile said ho was glad the conference was tackling something practical Something nai ex pected from it besides glittering generali ties Everybody favored the proposition to establish such a bank but an Institu tion so established was liable to cause trouble unless specific regulations were laid down In view of these facts Senor Matte pro posed that Instead of the committees plan a bank be established with a branch in the capital or principal city of each na tion the bank having a subsidy of 100000 gold annually Senor Mattes proposition was referred to the committee When the report of the committee on the practice of the learned professions was taken upSenorBermeJo tookoccaslon to criticise Senor Matte He Implied that Senor Mattes reference to the conference getting down to practical things was a slur on Senor Baeis speech However he said Senor Haeis proposition was the most important before the conference If the confercnca now failed to handle the subject of arbitration it would fall to respond to the call which brought the delegates there Senor Bacz thanked Senor Bermejo for his position with reference to Bae zs first speech Senor Bermejo honored his coun try by that position He himself came to the conference with uo preconceived ideas to force unon it That stirred Senor Martinez of Chile to a speech whlclialthough he declared it to be without passion simulated It suf ficiently to arrest absorbed attenti in He commented sharply on the foregoing In cidents referring to

Be a Part oi the United States RULING BY THE SUPREME COURT Ono Decision In tho Long Standing Insular Oases Adverse to tho Government Tho Dooloy Oaso Justice Browns Opinion The Philippine Islands are part of the United States therefore no duties can be collected on goods passing be tween those islands and the United States Decision In the fourteen diamond rings case Porto Rico is not in the United States therefore the clause of the Constitution that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State cannot be Invoked and the validity of the Foraker act is reaf firmed Decision In the Dooley case The United States Supreme Court yes terday handed down two of the most far reaching opinions rendered in tho recent history of that great tribunal In the first case the decision was against the Governments contention and was approved by Chief Justice Fuller and Justices Harlan Brewer Brown and Peckham Justices White Shlras Gray and McKcnna dissenting In the second case eight of the Justices were arrayed as jn the other case but Justice Brown Joined those who dissented In the diamond rings case and swung the decision In favor of the Government The position of Justice Brown In tho several cases Involving trade with tho newly acquired insular possessions has been a unique one While each of tho other Justices has been a dissenter to the opinion of the court in one or more of the cases he has always baen with tfco majority as his change of position ha3 carried with it the victory the remaining members of the court having been evenly divided Justice Ilrowit Ij iItIon In announcing his concurrence yester day Justice Brown said he did so for tho reasons given in the Porto Rico cases Congress he held could provide by leg islation what duties could be collected In those possessions not an integral pan of the United States Congress in regard to Porto Rico had so provided The status of the Philippines differed he held bc causo Congress had not If the Senate had adopted the so called McEncry resolution by a unanimous vote that might have affected tho situation But that resolution had passed by a vote of 26 to 22 not the necessary two thirds and It had failed to receive the concur rence of the House and the President Therefore the declaration contained In that resolution Is to be retarded as part of the treaty or a3 a modification of its provisions Justice Gray in announcing the dissent of himself and Justices White Shlras and McKenna said they based their opinion on tho Porto Rican cases already decided The Cn es Siimninrled In the fourteen diamond rings case Involving the status of the Philippine Isl ands the decision follows that rendered last spring in the Porto Rican and Hawaiian cases and as In those cases by a divided court fivo to four It was to tho effect that under the conditions obtaining in September 1S99 the Philippines were not foreign territory and articles of merchan dlsecomlnglntothiscountryfrom those Isl ands were no subject to the payment of duties under the Dlnglcy tariff law Brief ly the facts of th case are these Emil Pepke a North Dakota volunteer upon his return to the United States Sep tember 23 1M9 trought with him four teen diamond rings which he had pur chased in the island of Luzon -These were seized In Chicago in May 1900 and held for the payment of tariff duties Pcpke protesting that the property was not thus liable The district court held that they were liable declared them forfeited to the United States and ordered sale Thence a writ of error was prosecuted to the Su preme Courl Announcing the opinion of the court Chief Justice Fuller said Were these rings acquired by this rol dicr after the ratification -of tho treaty was proclaimed when brought by him from Luon to California on hl3 re turn with his regiment to lie discharged imported from a foreign country This question has already been answer ed in the negative in the respect cf Porto Rico and unless the cases can be distin guished which we are of opinion they cany not be in this particular that decision is controlling ITlMtorienl IrereilenlH Itevleived Historical precedents are reviewed In relation to territory conquered or ceded by way of Indemnity and tho decision then states- The Philippines thereby ceased in the language of tho treaty to be Spanish Ceasing to be Spanish they ceased to be foreign country They came under the complete and absolute sovereignty and dominion of the United States and so be came territory of the United States over which civil government could bo estab lished The result was the same al though there was no stipulation that tho native inhabitants should bo incorporated fnto the body politic nnd none securing to them the right to chooso their na tionality Their allegiance became due to the United States and they became en titled to Its protection Attention is given to the claims ad vanced that the case of the Philippines is to bo distinguished from that of Por to Rico because on February 14 1S99 after the ratification of tho treaty the Senate resolved by tho McEn cry resolution that it wa3 not in tended to incorporate tlie Inhabitants of the Philippines Into
