President. Wilson, in his presiden tial message to congress last week discusses: Mexico, farming credits, the amend ment of the Sherman law, the selec tion of nominees for the presidency, the Philippines. Alaska, conservation and the interest of labor. On none of these subjects does he give forth an uncertain voice. Huerta is explicitly characterized as a dictator and usurper.

GREAT REDUCTIONS jed that "such pretended government ' I will not be contenanced or dealt with !by the government of the United | States." This country is described t as being the champion of constitu- j tional government in the Americas, j j "because in no other way can our j neighbors work out their own devel opment in peace and liberty." The president sees the near collapse of! ! the Huerta regime and believes that ! "we shall not be obliged to alter our 'policy of watchful waiting." Thi means that he stands pat on his pres ' ent policy. The pending currency bill is re garded as doing the farmers great I service and congress is urged to en act "legislation which will make their abundant and substantial credit resources available as a foundation for joint, concerted local action in their own behalf in getting the cap ital they must use." Attention is called to the work of the commission that has studied European systems of rural credit. It is affirmed that "its report ought to make it easier for us to determine what method-! will be best suited to our own farmers." The president thinks that "the im j mediate service we owe the business j communities of the country is to pre | vent private monopoly more effectual i Iv than ft has yet been prevented. We, 'should let the Sherman law stand un ; altered, but as much as possible re- i , duce the debatable ground by further (and more explicit legislation, and j ! supplement that great act by legisla- j tion which will not only clarify it, 1 but faciliate administration and make it fairer." The president's policy is I to try to maintain private competition in business through governmental i I control over big business and through, 'further attempts to prevent mo j nopoly. | President Wilson.

His suggestion that these conventions consist of the presiden ! tial nominees the national commit tees, the federal senators and the nominees both for congress and for vacancies in the senate may not be acceptable to the judgment of th" public, but the country is ripe for congressional legislation to reform the present method cf choosing pres idential nominees. The reference to the Philippines is a defense of his policy of moving to ward their independence. Mr. Wi'- son believes that "by their (the Fili pino people's) counsel and experience rather than by our own we shall learn how best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision." Alaska should be given full terri torial government and be unlocked to development. The national gov ernment should build and adminisfc a system of Alaskan railways and control the terminals and the ports. Conservation of natural resources consists in using them without wast - and for the adding interests of com munities. These resources are con- j sidered by the president the heritage j of the nation and the government at ; large, but he has no doubt that c i policy of using them can be worked out that will release them without, jeopardizing them and regtjlate de- - velopment acceptably to the people and states immediately concerned a• j well as to the national public and tho. j national government. | Shop Early Only 13 shopping days remain be fore Christmas.

Mexico in the Party Platform It would be interesting to know i those who framed the platform adopt ed by the democratic convention at Baltimore a year and a half ago had Mexico in mind when they wrot* this plank: The constitutional rights of American citizens should protect them on our borders and go with them throughout the world and every American citizen residing or having property in any foreign country is entitled to and must be given the full protection of the United States government, torn Aberdeen's Greatest and Best Store RIBBON SPECIALS Fancy Flowered Ribbons, also some "plain colors, values up to 50c a yard; on sale, yard 19c Plain Silk Taffeta Ribbons in colors, 20c and 25c ones, on sale, yard lEc Plain Silk Taffeta Ribbons in colors. and SM>c ones, on sale for, yard 5c Shadow Laces up to 6 inches wide, also some Cluny Laces, on sale for. yard 15c Trunks, Bags, Cases--20 per ct.
