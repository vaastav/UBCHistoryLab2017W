MEXICO MISSOURI MESSAGE, MEXICO, MISSOURI. 1 'I Better Understanding Between Business Mennd Educators Very Greatly Needed By H MANNING I would suggest that business men, as occasion may arise, should become better acquainted with educators. These people have been too 'jridely separated, due, probably, to the fact that their work keeps them on opposite sides of a fence. It will be noticed, though, that the educa tional system is quite as complete as that of business, and getting a little insight into an educator's work is worth while. A business man concerns himself with material fact, grasps it quickly, and acts upon it. An educator has little interest in details, but studies out the principles that underlie thought and action. If each will keep this in mind, there should grow mutual understanding, appreciation, and vital co-operation from a better acquaintanceship. A necessary feature of education must be the presentation to fitu denta of a principle upon which they may ultimately act. It is training of this sort that inspires the young college graduate to discuss the prin ciples of window manufacture when he is only asked to close one. Such an attitude toward work tries the patience of a business man, but it must be remembered that the boy is on the right track, and after a little famil iarity with business systems devised for thoughtless help, uses something else besides expensive experience to help him. lie has been taught to look for underlying principles. Furthermore, educators instill in their pupils the highest ideals of life, so that when they take their place in the business world they are eager to secure positions of honor and respect, and their ideals form the backbone of the country's integrity. Their experience with business life, 'tiowever, destroys the ideals that have been developed so laboriously, and it is due the boys and the country 'correct the evil. At the present time we have no honor system that cultivates respect and toward which we can guide our sons. They can get the satisfaction that comes from accomplishment, as we all do, but it is impossible to point to any action that has at heart the betterment of the community without being met with the remark, seek high position is possible only for hide of a rhinoceros." Schools of Rural Districts Suffer by Being Made Football of Petty Politics By 

PROF. W. K. TATE Of George Peabody College for Teacher Nwhrille, Tenn. The first goal which we must reach before the rural school becomes dnore than a temporary makeshift is stability in administration and super vision. Up to this moment in most of the states the country school has (been the football of petty politics from the state department of education down to the local school district. Under the guise of democracy we have too often insisted that the country people shall not have the power to select in a sensible way the anen who are to administer their schools but that they must be allowed only the poor privilege of accepting every two or four years one of the candidates who scramble for the office on the tariff question or some other issue not related in the remotest degree to the welfare of the school system. Our zeal for democracy has, strangely enough, not extended to the 'Other educational institutions of the state. Our universities, colleges or .normal schools are administered by stable boards of trustees with rotating terms of office. These trustees have the privilege of looking the earth over to find the man who possesses in largest measure the qualities and abilities needed in the important office of college or university executive. The president and administrative board work out together the larger prob lems of the institution and, looking many years into the future, they enter on a definite program of service to the commonwealth. The presi dent of the university is the servant of the state and will be secure in this position as long as he serves the state faithfully. I " The city school system is administered by a stable board of trustees, who in like manner, acting' as a committee of , the people, select the city 'Superintendent of schools. The people should have the same right to use best judgment in the -selection of a state department of education that they now have in the selection of a president of the state university. They should be as free in the choice of a county superintendent as they now are in the election of their city superintendent. United States Needs Merchant Marine if It Is to Get South American Trade Bjr DR. 

WALTER WEBB American manufacturers and exporters apparently have the idea that whenever they are ready to go after it they can get the bulk of the trade in South America, . - v This is a very erroneous idea. No one should think that the Argen tine trade is easy to get, for instance, or that there is an immense volume of it. The population of the country is comparatively 6mall, and Euro pean manufacturers control the great bulk of trade. But the United States can get a large part of it if we go to work with energy. Eventu Jally we must have foreign trade, and we must have it soon. To get our share, we must go after it seriously; we must spend money and persever ance. And we, simply must have a merchant marine. Persons who think that after the war in Europe is ended. England, Germany, France and the other great commercial nations on that conti nent' will be so much occupied at trade in South America are making "will be Bharp competition, but the United States is well liked in Argen tina and other South American republics, and the people of those countries will buy American goods in preference to European articles, even when prices are higher, if we go at it in the right way. The people of Argentina are like the people of the United States in ' -a way. They have the same western ideas and push and are always branch ing out and seeking to grow and prosper. They have come to recognize that the United States is not only a country of great wealth and power, tout that it has high ideals, and this appeals to them very much, for thoj, too, axe a people of ideals. CARPENTER itself that we should get together and "What is there in it for you?" Tc him who, as Mr. Taf t says, "has the i home that they will not go out after the mistake of their lives. There WILSON'S MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS Senate and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of the President. HE 

MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS Further Legislation for Settlement and - Regulation of Railway Labor Dis putes Held Imperatively Neces sary by the chief Magistrate. Washington, Dec. 5. The senate and house met In joint session today and heard President Wilson's message, which was as follows: Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures as may be Judged necessary and expedient I shall continue the prnetlce, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub' 11c policy with which It seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pros' ent session of the congress. I renllze the limitations of time tin der which you will necessarily act lit this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible ; but there were some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete nnd which It seems necessnry In the Interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration nnd action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I hnd ocea slon to recommend to you at the close of your last session In view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, nnd which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country nnd their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended : First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently pnssed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate ; In order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great nnd various duties now devolving upon It with a prompt ness nnd thoroughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically Impossible. Second, the establishment of nn eight-hour day as the legnl basis alike of work nnd of wages In the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged In the work of oper nting trains in interstate transportn tlon. Third, the authorization of the np polntment by the president of a smnll body of men to observe the actual re sults In experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day In railway trans- portatlon alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of nn increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essnry by the adoption of the eight- hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should -the facts dis closed Justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, nnd arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to It a provision thnt, in case Ifte methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full publl Investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be Instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in the hands of the executive of the power, In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military .use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress Immediate ly acted on: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and It au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures moat Immediately needed; Unusual Experience. "Man," remarked Sandy, "I did a thing last nicht what I've no dune this twenty year. I went to in a bed pnlrr fectly sober, but I'm richt thankful to tay I got up this inornln' none, the waurl" " Few Beggars In Panama. Although the city of Panama is a most cosmopolltuu place, practically every ruce being represented In its 60, 000 inhabitants, there are no beggars, exceut a few bllud men. but It postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It neces sary to renew. The power of the in terstate commerce commission to grant an Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is lndlsputnhly clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission's authority or its inclination to do Justice when there is. no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the Increase in the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and In Its facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control nnd operate the rail- Ways when necessary in time of wnr or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest nnd pressing. Those who hnve intrusted us witn tne responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding Uiein in such matters would find It hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or nny unnecessary postponement of action upon thein. Not only docs the Interstate com merce commission now find It practi cally impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but It is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected ns nn administrative Instru ment. The country cannot nnd should not consent to remain nny longer exposed to profound Industrial disturbances for lnck of ndditlonul menns of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress enn ensily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt ns to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they nre needed nnd whenever they nre needed. This Is a program of regulation, pre vention nnd administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its Items, the increase in the effi ciency of the Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, nnd I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man In any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue In an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the Individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our Jurisprudence vvjilch I take It for granted we nre not prepared to Introduce. But the proposal thnt the operation of the railways of the country shull not be stopped or Inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public Investigation shall have Been Instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the In dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall hnve had an opportunity to re-quaint Itself with the merits of the ease as between em ployee and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in thnt proposition but the Justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessnry processes of its very life. There Is nothing nrbl trary or unjust in It unless It be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full nnd scrupu lous regard for the Interests and liber ties of all concerned ns well us for the permanent interests of society Itself, Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital Importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country thun Is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of I'orto Hlco ; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money In elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I r.eed not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the munlfest circum stances which reuder their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delay would seriously Jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg- Most Fishermen Have Done It, "Simple Simon went a-fishlng In his mot her '8 pall." "Not so simple, at that." declared the amateur sportsman. "I've spent time and money getting to a place where the likelihood of oatchlug fish was no whit greater." Nothing New. "I see some scientific sharp has dis covered a substitute for bread." "He needn't think he's so much. Our cook bus been turning 'that out for years." u'ate the expenditure of money In ele j tlons may seem to bo less necessary than the immediate enactment of tb other measunM to which I refer; be cause at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices nre to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind If this Important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campulgn funds stand clear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In the light of present experience ; and a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and Bonis gpcalnl object connected wltjj it might be thought to be In the mind of those who urged It Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand In the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will Immediately assume, has Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented In our experience. We have not the necessary Instrumen talities for its prosecution; It is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon nn adequate scale under our present laws. We should clenr away all legal obstacles i - "On.. the other hand, Premier Aa and create a basis of undoubted law' u!th insfsfk there will be no neac for It which, will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity Is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico Is brief and conclusive. The present lnws governing the lslnnd and regulating the rights nnd privileges of Its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There nre other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be- tween the two houses of which It is j nlal possessions now held by the Brit not necessary that I should speak, j lsn- Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occnslon I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you in the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It hns been a privilege to labor In such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servlcenbleness and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of un ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that nre to be used as masts In logging operations, dyna mite is used to shoot off the tops.

The rigger ties a string vt dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around the trunk at this point, inserts a blasting cap with about 'JO feet of fuse in one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, und de scends before the explosion takes place.

CLARK ADVISES THE PRESIDENT TO ACT SPEAKER 8AY3 TIME IS RIPE FOR U. 8.

Speaker Champ Clark, In patriotic outburst, urges President Wilson to make some effort to stop the conflict in Europe. Ho says in part: "Once more the German chancellor Indicates that Germany is willing to negotiate as to peace, stating plainly that Germany will do so, not from fear, but from an earnest and hu mane deBire to prevent further ' effu sion of blood. untll the allies are victorious-i-whicb finally they may or may not be. Allies Scouted Idea. "It will be remembered that some thing like a year ago Germany was ready to consider peace on the basis of 'the maps.' "The spokesman for the allies said that that proposition was preposter ous that It gave the central powers a vast advantage. "The allies are in worse condition now, or will be in a few days, when, the central powers completely over run Rumania, to settle by 'the maps' than they were when the tentative proposition was first made by the German chancellor a year ago. "At present, no doubt, the portions of Europe which the central powers now hold of other nations' lands are more valuable than the kaiser's colo- "ur course, an numane persons everywhere are exceedingly desir ous of seeing the stupendous war ended. Wishes Wilson Would Act. "Whether President Wilson has any idea of tendering his kind offices to the warring nations, I have not sufficient Information to form a be lief, but such tender on his part would compel the attention of the? civilized world. "Should his tender be declined, it would do no harm. Should he suc ceed, his rtnown would be everlast ing and he would be acclaimed the master peacemaker in the entire his tory of the human race."
