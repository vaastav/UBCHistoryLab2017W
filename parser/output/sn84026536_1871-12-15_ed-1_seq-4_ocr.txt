Kicipav, Dec. s, 1S71. , of l.'ow an. from the connnit- 31 1 - I e dibilr- tee on eon litntional reform, presented the following report, wilh a hill on the suhject, whifh was ordered to he printed : i:i;eoi:T. The ioiul s-iect eojumitte on const it u- lioii.il amendment heg leave to report that lln v h ive caiefully considered all the hills j on (his snhjeri which have heen referred to j I hem in either House. These hills are mi- . iii.-roiis. hut though they d.ijl'el' to some- ex- j lent in sni.stanee as well as phraseology, I llieyagree in several main features. The! eommiilcc have therefore culled Irom them , lli.se provisions in whieh the various hills j nee.! gcneraliy coincide in suhstance, and wlii'ii appear most important, and these j I hey have incorporated ii:!o a I'iJl which i the" hriew ith present as a suhstitute for all j i In- hill, referred to them, and recommend ( i ii - -as -av.e. ! il -u ill he seen that this hill emhraees hut ; a l-'v dishnct ideas. A single sit I Meet, such f .i instance as the aholishment of the tow n ship syslriiu can only he accomplished hy aliering the i 'oust it ut ion in the several par lieul.'.rs w hich relate to that system; and ihe case is the same with regard to other suhjecls. 'l'herefoie, although tlieproiosed allei-alions an- in fact hut few, the commit tee could not condense them into a, shorter or simpler hill. The suhstaive of the lull concisely staled emhraees the following points: The striking out of the provisions relating to the (State debt, the township sys (iii, (he .State census, the code commission, and the .superintendent of public w orks, the reduction ofihe number or judges, and re quiring the Superior Court judges to hold coin Is in i ' -tat ion, biennial sessions of the h uei al Assembly, and biennial terms of executive olHeers, the prohibit "on of persons holding t '.vii ollices at one. ;h provision that deaf and dumb and insane persons having adequate means shall defray the ex iienr as of (lie State in taking care of them. impov. ering the Legislature, if they deem i it bes I. to change the form vt' county gov- ; eminent and Ihe ollicers having the control : of probate business, l distribute the juris-; diction of all courts except the Supreme, to , establish .Superior Courts if needful, and to ,' p";u!a!e and perfect the school system. i It is believed that the adoption of these ; amendments will give the people of the ! ."stale a much better and cheaper system of ; internal administration and more in bar- j niony with their taste an 1 character. 1! will be seen that the bill contains no i provision changing or contra-. en ing any' feat ure of the present constitution which; guarantees the equal rights, privileges and immunities of all citizen,-;. This being the j ease, i lie ci iinnultee indulge the hope that Ihe (o ii' ial Assembly "will pass it without s.

The President's Message. , To war-worn aholitionists it must be re freshening to read this message, wherein aversion to slavery at home and abroad, with recommendations that our citizens be forbidden to hold slaves in countries where human bondage is still legal, congrat ulations on the initiation of enfrancliise ment in Brazil, hopes that the process may he hastened, complaints that Spain's sem blance of emancipation in Cuba and Porto Kico is a mockery, &c, are so prominent. We judge that our relations with Spain are more crittical than the President's guarded language would indicate ; otherwise, we should strenuously ol ject to his endorsement of Secretary Robeson's "suggestion as to the necessity for increasing and improving the material of the navy." We protest against such any increase. The President 's recommendations that the internal taxes be swept away, ex cept those known as stahips, and ihose levied on liquors and tobacco, will meet with general approval. May we not hope that Congress will act promptly and decid idly oii this recommendation '.' As to tariff revision, Ihe President reflects very nearly the average sentiment of the eopie. Put v. e guess his true friends in Congress w ill make haste slowly iu reducing the revenue from this source. With regard to the Ku- Klux outrages, we wish the Presi- dent had seen fit, moreover, to indicate his abhorrence of the earjiel-bag villainies whereby several Southern States have been imitoverished and their credit broken down villainies which partially explain but in no manner excuse the crimes of the Ku Klux prowlers. As to "uniting the telegraphic system of the United States with the postal system," can the President be unaware that this means buying out the present stockholders in tele graphs at treble the cost of constructing the existing. lines, and thus enriching a small number at the expense of the great hotly of their fellow-citizens'.' lie ought to know this, for we warned him of it personally a year ago, and then advised him that the people would not stand it. We have some plain strictures to oiler on civil sen ice reform, but these can wait. k'lAMk Here l'Hii TIiim I'ieiure n:cl on Could the inhabitant of another sphere be transKrtetl to this our planet, ami made to alight in either of the Carolinas, he would doubtless infer, if ignorant of the true rea sons, that the 'ruler' of this happy ('.') land was actuated by the most laudable ambi tion to do justice and suppress crime. On all hands he would find the jails crowded, ami fresh ei imhudu constantly arriving: the oflicers of the constabulary continually on the alert, arresting men ami even women upon the slightest taint of suspicion ; the old set foims of law set aside or ignored as too dilatory for the occasion, and superseded by new forms swift", sure and Draconian in their results.
