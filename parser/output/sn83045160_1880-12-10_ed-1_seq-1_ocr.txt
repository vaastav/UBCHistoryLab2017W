Re ferred. The Vice-l'resMent laid before the senate a communication from the secretary of war, t-ansmitting copisa oi the correspondence had with the legal rciireseiilatives of the ( 'on re leratc Generals BraggTind Polk, with a view to the purchase of their private papers, relating to the late war, as per act of June 16, 1830. The Pdk papers have been placed in the hands of the government, with permis sion to use such is are deemed important to the publication now authorized bv law. The price asked for the entire collection is $10, 000. The Bragg papers have been submitted for the purpose of lieing catalogued. ?o present price is stipulated for, but they, as well as the Polk collection", were appraised in 1878 at $10,000, Itnd could, doubtless, now be purchased at that sum. The m crctary says that heretofore no purchases for archivis have been made from Federal officers, and only the trans-Mississippi, Sidney Johnston and Sneed papers from Confederate officers. The great bulk of the acquisitions haVi? been g f a. So far a' the secretary knows, the o ily important collections as yet unobtaiiud a-e those under consideration.

I Lord wan taken up. It grants her ?21( 0 as i arrears of in nsiou for her dead husband. It was opposed on technical grounds by mem bers of the pemion committee, as the require- 1 mcnts of law had not been observed as to the j time of tiling the application for pension. After a debate the Eenate, by a vote of 1") to Xi, refused tj have the bill read a third j time. It thus drops. On motion of Senator Paddock, the senate bill providing for the sale cf the remainder of the reservation of the confederated Otoe and Missouri tribes of Indians in NcLrjska ad Kansas, and for other purposts, was taken up.

On motion of Seuator Garland, the senate bill to secure .he safe keeping of money paid iuto court wot taken up and passed. On motion of Senator Plumb the senate not conceive of anything more detestable than rejecting the vote of a State, except vot ing a State against its will; that was the crime of the Republican party. It had accepted perjury and forgery as a means of certifying votes. In the face of this fact gentlemen of the other side stood here and endeavored to give the Vice-President power to count the votes. It was an attempt at usurpation that looked to the future, and there was no legislative ac tion that was not justifiable to defeat that purpose. A disjointed, running debate then ensued, participated in by Messrs. McLane, Calkins, Hunter, Cox N. Y. and Mills, during the course of which Mr. Mills intimated his opposition to the (tending resolutions on the ground that under its provisions the senate might declare who was President. Mr. Lapham said that at the last session he had looked upon the pending measure as an attempt to debauch the electoral count. Why were the wheels of legislation now blocked to consider a question, when it was admitted that there was no necessity what ever for the operation f the extraordinary provisions of this resolution? That there was lying behind it some purpose he was bound to assume from the tenacity with which this matter was pressed. Under its provisions, questioning a return would jus tify a majority in rejecting the vote of a State. It provided that if more than one list of electoral votes, or "papers purporting to be such list," were received from a State, ei'.her house msy receive the vote. What was this paper? An official paper? Not at all; but a paper certified by the chairman of a Democratic State committee would answer the requirements of that provision. The Re publicans were willing to justify themselves in resorting to every expedient known to par liamentary usage to resist the purpose of this resolution. Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to the theory that the Vice-President had the right to count the vote. He denied that there was any political motive which induced the Dem ocrats to press the matter, unless a de sire to prevent the theory that the Vice President had the power to declare who was his successor from passing into a precedent was a political motive. Mr. Newberry made an elaborate argument in support of the proposition that the power to count the votes was vested in the Vice President. The proposed rule was unconsti tutional, in that it attempted to take from the president of the senate certain powers and rights and vest them in the two houses. Pending further debate the house ad j urued. f A

Representative Kelley, Pa., has pre pared a substitute for the refunding bill now pending before congress. It provides that the secretary of the treasury .-hall be authorized to issue notes to the amount of $400,000,000, denominations not to be less than ten dollars, bearing interest at the rate of not exceeding three per cent, per annum, redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after one year, and payable in ten years from date of issue; but not more of said notes shall lie redeemed in any one fiscal year than the amount of the sinking fund for that year, and the particular notes to be re deemed from time to time shall be deter mined by lot under such rules as the secre tary of the treasury shall prescribe. This will lie offered by Representative Kelley as "a substitute whenever the Wood refunding bill is called up.

Between eighty or ninety were in attendance, and the debate, whii-b occupied two hours anil a half, was quite general. Among those who took part were Senators Blaine, Anthony, Ferry and Teller, and Representatives Lapham, Hawler, Conger, Keiler, Haskell, Batter worth, Hiscock and Robeson. The only que: lion upon which any differenev of opinion was expressed was as to the extent to which it should be considered pecessari or advisa ble to oppose the adoption of the pending rule.

Mr. MeUiiie then took the floor, and pro ceeded to s)eak on the senate resolution, re plvinir especially to the speech made vester- day by Mr. Rubeson. That ge'ntlnnau laid! down the proposition that no judicial power could be cxcrcisce! by congress except by ex press gran'. The 1'ib, article of the con stitution wis th- express grant to congress to count the cte through all times. The idea that the Vice-President could count the votes; that he who might have a place on the ticket should decide what votes should be received and what rejected, had never been accepted in the history of the country. Over and over again had this subject been debate'd. Unhappilv, once :.. e i 11' i v i i u h:lil lieen tiou, or that any dHiiger at the present junc ture need be anticipated from the adoption of the proposed rule, the majority held that a great principle was at stake which might at some time effect the stability of our institutions, and that the policy of j the party should be to meet the bsue now, and to resist, by every known parliamentary method, the adoption of a proposition alike unwarranted by the constitution and at variance with the prece dents of the past. At the conclusion of the debate a vote was taken upon Judge Lap ham's resolution, eleclaring it to lie ''the sense of the caucus (ha( the Republican minority should resist the adoption of this joint rule by all the means authorized by par liamentary law," and without dissent it was adopted.
