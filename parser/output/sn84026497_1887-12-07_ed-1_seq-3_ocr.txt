ft THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. J. C. WINK, CCITO 4 SoeSltTOS. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER?, 1887. M. Saw Carnot is the new Presi dent of the French Republic. Ho is looked upoo as ft man of much ability, but has little record as a statesman. Ax least ono Deniocralio paper op prcciates its cold-water allies. In an exuberant burst of enthusiasm the Kansas City Time ejaculates: "G d bless the noble Prohibitionists of New York. We need 'em in our business." The Postmaster Oenoral'i report shows that one cent letter postage is about three years off". The revenues of the department are moro nearly ready for the change tban they were three years before two-cent postage was adopted. A late dispatch from Minneapolis says: "Nearly complete returns of the Q. A. R, vote on the proposed depend ent pension bill have been received at the national (J. A. R. headquarters iu this city, and it is practically unani mous in favor of the hill. The gen eral pension .commission Geueral Murrell, of Lawrence, Mass , chair man will complete the returns and present them to congress." Thk fiftieth Congress met and open ed its session Monday. Speaker Carlisle, the free trader, was re elected by the Democrats, the Republicans voting for Mr. Reed of Maine. The President's Message was not presented until yesterday, and as it covers much more space than his last year's volum inous effort, it is not likely that more than one out of a hundred will ever have the courage to wade through it. The British holders of Confederate bonds will have a strong lobby at Washington this Winter to boom scheme to make the Government re deem those securities. The confidence of these misguided investors is pathet ic, and yet not surprising. A man who was fool enough to buy those bonds in the first place may easily be excused for the milder folly of expect ing thia Government to redeem them. rhila. Press. W. C. T. TJ.

Qld Ilinglatid is well pleased with President Cleveland's message. Two of the principal papers of London comment as follows: The Morning Post says: "The messsge will pro duce a profound sensation in Europe as well ss in America, and will strengthen the free traders' cause throughout tbe world. The Daily Jveww says: "Seldom has an American President had a more important lesson to teach. The fact is that although President Cleveland -Ves a pretense of shutting hisgjeg' ,. .m policy oi pT'iioIiTias beeu reduced to a practical and theoretical absurdity. Tbe stone now rolling will not stop until the idol of protection is broken in pieces." What tbe people of this country want is a message that will please Americans more aud Eugland less.
