Sends His First Annual Message to the Senate and House of RECOMQEEDATIONS Eutorizes the Late President McKinley and Advocates Stern Measures . . - . lor Anarchists Proposes 1 rust licity Favors Government Construction of Irrigation "Works Urges Construction of Isthmian Canal and Laying of Pa cific Cable Asks Legislation for the Colonies and Reciprocity for Cuba Would Exclude Chinese. The following Is a comprehensive sum tnary of President Roosevelt's message to congress: The president begins his first annual communication with an official announce ment of the death of the late President McKinley, and a eulogy of his former chief in which he savs: "It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKJnley's deatn ne was the most widely-loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the hitter- am mosities Incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which are all important In the makeup of national character. A gallant sold.er in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him. for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer- cised for political ends inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. "The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends and of unfaltering trust in the will of the Most High. Such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with infinite sorrow, but with such gride in what he had accomplished and in is own personal character that we feel the blow not as struck at him. but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who is dead, but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his deatn. "When we turn from the man to the na tion, the harm done is so great as to ex cite our gravest apprehensions and to de mand our wisest and most resolute ac tion. This criminal was a professed an archist, inflamed by the teachings of pro fessed anarchists and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who on the stump and In the public press appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy ana sullen natrea. me wina is sowed by the men who preach such loctrines, and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaied. This applies alike to the deliberate demagogue, to - the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish -visionary who for whatever rea son apologizes for crime or excites aim less discontent. "The blow was aimed not at this presi dent, but at all presidents, at every sym bol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the embodiment of the popular will of the nation expressed through the forms of law as a New Eng land town meeting is in similar fashion the embodiment of the law abiding pur pose and practice of the people of the town. On no conceivable theory could the murder of the president be accepted as due to protest against "inequalities in the social order" save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meet ing could be accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a male factor In Jail. Anarchy is no more an ex pression of "social discontent" than pick ing pockets or wife beating." In the same connection he makes strong recommendations as to how the nation should deal with anarchy. He urges that the preaching or teaching of anarchy be not permitted, and requests congress to enact legislation that will prevent anarchists from foreign countries landing upon our shores. He would also have the federal courts given Jurisdiction over any man who kills, or attempts to kill, the president of the country, or any person who is in line for succession to the presidency. He has no fear, however, that the country will ever fall into an archy. "The federal courts should be given Jur isdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law Is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade, for it Is of far blacker Infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among ail civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with tha crime." The Trasts. The president sees cause for congratu lation for the nation in the business condl- mendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever ac celerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century" a serious social does not believe that the old laws and old customs are sufficient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution of wealth of the present time. He does not attribute the creation of great corporate fortunes to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, op erating In other countries as they operate In our own." In this connection ha says: "The process has aroused much antago nism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never be fore has the average man, the wage worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as In this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet it remains true that a for tune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the person spe cially benefited only on condition of con ferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise of the type which benefits all mankind can only ex ist if the conditions are such as to offer great prises as the rewards of success " But while he realises existing condi tions, he emphasises the fact that congress in providing remedies must act with cau tion, as the men and corporations "who have built up our commerce and driven our railroads across the continent have done great rood to our people, and without them the material development of which we are so Justly proud could never have taken place. Moreover, we should rtcor- nise the Immense Importance to this ma terial development of leaving as unham pered as is compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the success of business operations Inevitably rests The slightest study f business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a Judgment that the personal equation is the most Important factor in a business operation: that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern, big or little. Is usual ly the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure." Another reason for caution in trust legis- lnternational commercial conditions of to day. The same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and Individual wealth have made them very potent factors in inter national commercial competition. Busi ness concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead In the strife for com aaercisi supremacy among the nations of Representatives OH 

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. . .Legislation Along1 the Lines ox Pub the world. America has only lust begun to assume that commanding position In the international business world which we believe will more and more be hers. It smon oe not jeoparded, especially at a time when the overflowing himrianr of mi ... . . . ... . - when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the skill, bus! ness energy and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign markets essen tial, under sucn conditions it woma be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our nation. "Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the Interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national life, the rule which underlies all others, is that on the whole and in the long run we shall go up or down together. There are excep tions, and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more and in times or adversi ty some will suffer far more than others; but, speaking generally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in them, and in a period of hard times all reel the stress to a greater or less degree. He points to the fact that in the past me ignorant or reckless agitator nas been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally oppos ing In dealing with business interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far-reaching na tional disaster that it would be prefer able to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the Impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those wno wouia endeavor to find out in rational lasmon what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is prac ticable to apply remedies. Remedies for the Trust Evil. But while he says the above is true, he yet sees many evils for which there should be remedies provided. Of these evils the chief is over capitalization, "because o Its many baleful consequences.'' He says: The conviction or the American people that the great corporations, known as trusts, are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. is based upon sincere conviction that com Dination and concentration snouid do not prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled, and In my Judgment this conviction is right. As a remedy ror tnese evils ne says "The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the interest of the public the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings or the great corporations engaged in inter state business, publicity is tne omy sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after ..publicity nas been obtained by process or law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete knowledge which may be made public to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to nroner governmental supervision, and full and accurate information as to their operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states. often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them, and as no state has any exclusive Interest in or power over their acts it has in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore in the interest of the whole people the nation should, without interfering witn tne pow er of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an inter state business. This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to it. and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed it is probable that supervision of corpora tions by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts in order to produce excellent results. When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no hu man wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political conditions, wnicn were to taae place djt the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were tne proper authorities to regulate so far as was then necessary the comparatively in significant and strictly localized corporate bodies oi the day. The conditions are now wholly different, and wholly different ac tion is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the na tional government to exercise control along the lines above Indicated, profiting by the experience gained through, the pas sage and administration of the interstate commerce act. If. however, the judgment of the congress is that it lacks the consti tutional power to pass such an act. then constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power." In connection with the trusts he rec ommends legislation creating a cabinet of ficer, to bo loon ss secsetary of :iru- ne.ee, whose tli t es woul-1 be to deal with all qu uons concern g commerce, later and tha merchant marine. Woold Exelnde the Chinese. The message oriiains a strong recom mendation for U e reenactment at .m:e of the present Chinese exclusion act, in wnicn connection ne says: "Wages are higher to-day in the united States than ever before' in our history and rar rugner man in any otner coun try. The standard of living is also higher than ever before, isvery errort or ictns- lator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition ot things and its improvement wherever possible. rsot only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be Drotected so far as it is possible from tne presence in tnis country oi any la borers nrougnt over Dy contract or or those who. coming freely, yet represent standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag mem to a lower level. rec-ard it as necessary, with this end in view, to reenact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in or der to make its enforcement entirely ef fective." "The national government should de mand the highest quality of service from its employes and In return It should be a good employer, if possible, legislation should be passed in connection with the interstate commerce law wnicn win ren der effective the efforts of different states to do away with the competition of convict contract labor In the open la bor market. So far as practicable un der the conditions of government work provision should be made to render the enforcement of the eight-hour law easy and certain. In all Industries carried on directly or indirectly for the United States government women and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor, from night work and from work under unsanitary conditions. The gov ernment should provide in Its contracts that all work should be done under "fair" conditions and. in addition to setting a high standard, should uphold It by prop er Inspection, extending If necessary to the subcontractors. The government should forbid all night work for women and children as well as excessive over time. For the District of Columbia, a good factory law should be passed, and. as a powerful indirect aid te such laws. Srovision should be made te turn the ln ablted alleys, the existence of which is a reproach to our capital eity, 1st minor streets, where the Inhabitants can live under conditions favorable to health and morals. ia ilia labor unions of the present he sees much that Is good, in which connection he says: "Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions or wageworkers waen managed with foretnougnt ana when they combine in sistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. Finally there must also in many cases b action by the government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our constitution there is much more scope for such action by the state aid the municipality than by the nation. But on points such as those touched on above the national government can act. "When all is said and done, ihe rule of brotherhood remains as the indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of na tional life for which we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unlesG he so works no outsids help can avail him. But each man must rsmernber also and that whiieeno man who refuses to that he is indeed his brother s keeper. I walk can be carried with .idvantnire to himself or anyone else, yt that each at times stumbles or halts, that each at times needs to have the helping hand out- stretohftd in him. To be nrm;inently ef fective aid must always tks the form of helping a man to help himselt, ana we can all best help ourselves by joining 10- K-ether in the work that is or common in terest to all." The Immigration Laws. He pronounces our present immigration laws unsatisfactory. In which connection ht says "we need every honest and ei- i'.cient immigrant fitted to become an American citizen, every immigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a stronjr bedy. a good head and a resolute purpose to dc his duty well m every way I n rt ri K.i . im nic n li . 1. 1 Ti.Tl a a I O nr. St PHrt 1T1 ST. I y -i' 7 r J God-fearing members of the community. But he says: "There should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of workinir threefold Improvement over our present system First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarcuistic prin ciples or members of anarchistic socie- ties, but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory repu tarion. This means that we should re Quire a more thorough system or lnspec t'en abroad and a more rigid system -or exam.rr.tion at our immigrition ports. the former being especially necessary. "The second object of a proper immi gration law ought to be to se-jnre by a careful and not merely perfunctory eau ca tional test some intelligent capacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American citizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them belong to the Intelligent criminal class, but it would do what is alsj in point tnat is, tend to decrease tne sum oi ig norance so Dotent in Droducinsr the envy suspicion, malignant passion ard natreo of order out of which anarchistic senti ment inevitably springs. Finall-r all per sons should te excluded who are below a certalr standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors witn American labor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an American llvir.s and enoueh money to insure a decent start under American con ditions. This would step the Influx of cheap labor and the resultlrg competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness In American industrial life, and it would dry up tne springs of the pestilent ial social conditions in our crest cities where an archistic organisations have their great est possibility or rrowtn. rSoth the educational and wnnnmlctufi in a wise immigration law should he n signed to protect and elevate the general uoay, political and social, a very close su pervlsion should be exercised over the steamship companies which mainly brine over the immigrants, and they should be neia to a strict accountability for any In fraction of the law." The Tariff. The president does not desire anv chance In the present tariff schedule except where sucn may oe made in reciprocity treaties. ana recommends tne adoption oi reclproc ity treaties and the general doIicv of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of foreign nations to our commerce, in which connection ne says: Every application of our tariff nollcv ta meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point tnat win cover the difference between the labor rust here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economic legislation. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hearty sup Dort. ine Phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of tne need ror wider markets ana for a lib eral policy in dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex atious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products In the long run directly or Indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as pos sible be secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can t se without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. It Is most important that we should' maintain the high level or our present prosperity. we nave now xeacneo tne point in tne development oi our interests where we are not only abl to supply our own markets, but to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any case where they are no ior.ger neeoed ror tne purpose of protection, or in any case where the article is rot produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask. The cor dial relations with other nations which are so desirable will naturally be pro moted by the course thus required by our own interests. "The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those or our productions wnicn no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. "I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor." The Merchant Marine. The president pronounces our merchant marine "discreditable to us as a nation and insignificant to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business," and savs we "should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling por tion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships, or this ne says: To remedy this state ot tnir.irs would not merely serve to build us our shinning in terests, but It wou'ii elo result In benefit to all who are irterested In the perma nent establishment of n wider market foi American products ar.d would provide an auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work for their own ccur tries lust as railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping lines. If established to the principal coun tries with which we have dealings, would be of political as well as commercial ben efit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the United State.- to continue to rely upon the ships of competing m tions for the distribution of on. goods. It Ehould be made advantageous to carry American goods in American built ships." His recommendation on this subject is only that "our government should take such action as will remedy these inequali ties, lne American mercnant marine should be restored to the ocean." Finances. Under this heading the president recom mends such legislation as wil. better safe guard against the .ieriinging influences of commercial crises and financial panics and such as will make the currency of the country more responsive io the demands of domestic trade and commerce. He points out the leet that the recvfnfi from duties on imports ard internal taxes exceed tne exptnc tun-s or the govern ment, but counsels acair.st reduclnr the revenues so that there mli! 'os the possi bility of a deficit. But after providing acair.st anv snrh contingency .T.esnj should be ednntod which will brirg the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs." He urges the necessity for strict hmarit In expenditures, but that "our national needs forbid us to be niacrardlv in th mat ter of providing whatever Is actually nec essary iu our weii-Deing. later-State Commerce. He points to defects In the fntrtat commerce law, and recommends amend ments te correct them, in which connection be says: 'Those who complain of the muiimnmt of the railways allege that established rates are net maintained, that re bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to, that these preferences are usually In faver of the large shipper, that they drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates are too low many others are excessive and that gross preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the oth er nana, tne railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many or tnese mega practices oy depriving car riers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to estab lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates. Tne act snouia do amended. The rail way to & public servant, its rates should be Just te and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it - that within Its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are tne arteries tnrougn wnicn the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies." Agrrlcnltaral Interests. The president cites the forest legislation of the nast and the great good of forest preserves to the people, and says they will inevitably oe or sun greater vaiue. vou- tinuine. he says: "At nresent the protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the united states geological sur vey and the preparation of plans for their conservative use witn tne oureau ot ior estrv. which is also charged with the gen eral advancement of practical forestry in the United States. These various func tions Ehould be united in the bureau of forestry, to which they properly beiorg. The present diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective cooperation between the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves, without which the interests of both must suffer. The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the department of agriculture. The president should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest re serves to the department of agriculture. He already has "such'power in the ease of lands needed by the departments of war ano tne navy. Irrigation. Irrigation in connection with the waste lands or the west is a question to whicn the president gives considerable attention. and makes strong recommendations tor government assistance in reclaiming the waste lands bv assisting in their irriga tion and the control of water rights wher ever mat is possible, and ot tms ne says: "In the arid region it is water, not land, which measures Droduction. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to-aay If the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for irriga tion. The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. "In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are coming back, and hundreds of persons, especially rrom the immediate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camninsr. Some at least of the forest reserves should afford per petual protection to tne native fauna and nora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger tunas ano tree camping grounds for the ever-increasing numbers of men and wom en wno have learned to find rest, health ano recreation in the splendid forests and iiower-ciao meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of nur rwn- ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few." "The forests alone cannot, however, fullv regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are nec essary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construc tion has been conclusively shown to be an unaertaKlner too vast for nrivate effort. Nor can it be best accomplished bv the in dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are involved, and the resources of single states would often be inadequate, it Is properly a national function, at least in some of its features. It is as right for the national government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works ror water storage as to make userui tne Amf,rican Ehip canal, is abrogated. It spe rivers and harbors of the humid region by ciany provides that the United States engineering works of another kind. The I ione shall do the work of building and storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an en largement of our present policy of river control under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams. 'The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the Cow of streams the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as tne natural now "The reclamation and settlement or the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and MississiDDl valleys brought pros perity to the Atlantic states, 'lne in creased demand for manufactured arti cles will stimulate industrial production. while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larjer rood sup- nlies and effectually Drevent western competition with eastern agriculture. In deed, the oroducts of irrigation will be consumed rhieflv in UDbuilding local cen ters of mining and other industries wnicn would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole win pront. for successful homemaking is dui anomer nnm for tha unbulldinK" of the nation. He counsels ae-ainst attemnting too much at the beginning, but advises that we let experience on a small plan teach the pos sibilities of areater undertakings. He also fit t-t th conditions under which the set tiers of the west are attempting to ouiia homes on these and lands, and says: The security and value of the homes created depend largely on tne stability oi titles to water, but the majorlty.-of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rende.ed in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditaole exceptions. the arid states have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water in excess or actual uses or ne cessities, and many streams have already passed into private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership. "Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water anart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownership, wnicn nas been per mitted to erow ud in the arid regions snouid give way to a more enngntened and larger recognition of the rights of the pub lic in the control and disposal of the pub lic water supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid' regions, where water is too abundant to justiry hoarding it, have no proper application in a cry counrry "In the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that or use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and oe inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual- water rights to other than users without compensation to the public is open to all the objections wnicn apply to giving away nernetual franchises to the public utlu ties of the cities. A few of the western states have already recognized this and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual state ownership or water. The Colonies. Considerable attention Is given the col onies, and especially the Philippines. This section of tha message begins by citing the needs of Hawaii and Porto Rico, of which he says: In Hawaii our aim must be to develon the territory on tne traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of Iars;e estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthv American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view. The well being of the average homemaker must afford the true test of the healthy devel opment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled nn mir homestead system. Of Porto itico ne says tne island is tnriv- Inar as never before, ana is being adminis tered efficiently ana nonesiiy. xie ueems no legislation necessary except that con cerning the public lands oi tne isiana. He calls attention to tne iact tnat in Cuba the independent government of the island' will soon be in control, and in tne same connection urges strongly the need of reciprocal trade relations with the new nation, upon which subject he says: "In the case of Cuba there are weighty reasons of morality ano or national inter est why the policy should be held to have a beculiar application, and 1 most earnest ly ask vour attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of providing for a sub stantial reduction in tne tariff duties en Cuban imports into the United States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired that she should stand in Inter national matters in closer and more friend ly relations with us than with any other power, and we are bound by every consid eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial r measures In the interest of her material well being." For the Philippines he recommends much In the way of legislation, but again coun sels caution that we go neither too far nor with too great haste. He says: "We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves, and as an earnest of what we intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained In the Philippines than ever before in their his- He says we do not desire to do for the Islanders "merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics to make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really free nations." But the Idea of the president Is that we cannot leave the islands at this time, of which he says: 'To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall Into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such a desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity." But ha believes sufficient progress hag been made along the lines under which we have been working in the islands to war rant us in passing new legislation, but in mis connection ne urges the need of eau tion. He believes the time has come when the industries of which the islands are capable should be encouraged by granting irancnises- tor ineir development, and ef this he says: "Nothing better can be done for the Is lands than to introduce industrial enter prises. Nothing would benefit them so mucn as throwing them open to industrial development. 'lne connection between idleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to oo remunerative work is one of the surest preventives of war. Of course no business man wilt go into the Philippines unless it is to his interest to co so, and it is immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go in. It is therefore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed, so that franchises (lor limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing business in them and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every kind "Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only untrer regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper ex ploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop It must be given tne opportunity. The neidmust be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor in the development of every region over which our nag nas nown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will give free play to industrial enterprise, and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people or the islands tne best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them The construction of a Pacific cable is also urged, either that the government lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines, or that an arrangement be made by which the advantages ac cruing from a government cable may be secured to tne government oy contract with a private cable company. This he deems necessary for both commercial, political and military considerations. The Isthmian Canal. He calls attention to the need of Isthmian- canal, and says: "Its importance to the nation is by no means limited merely to its material ef fects upon our business prosperity, and yet with a view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacinc coast and tne gulf and south Atlantic states. It would also greatly benefit other sections. It is emphatically a work which it is lor the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with pros pects of success and which when done are not only permanent assets in the na tion's material interests, but standing monuments to its constructive ability. Of the new treaty recently concluded with England he says: "I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotia tions on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit or friendliness and mutual good will and re spect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the senate a treaty wnicn it ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time and which guarantees to this nation every right that it has ever asked in connection' with the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in adequate to supply the base for the con struction and maintenance of a necessarily assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and snail regulate us neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without tne guarantee or interference of any outside nation from any quar ter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the senate, and if ap proved the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the canal." The Monroe Doctrine. The president sets forth the objects of the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit in which it has been received by other countries, and in connection with it says this nation has not the slightest desire to acquire any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors, and cites our atti tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our good faith. He says also that "this doctrine has nothing to do with the com mercial relations of any American power save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it aesires." That "we do not ask for any exclusive commercial treaty with any other American state." He says of this: "The Monroe doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas as it is of the United States. Just 7S years have passed since President Monroe in his annual message announced that 'the American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power." In other words, the Monroe doctrine is a declaration that there must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any Ameri can power on American soil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation In the old world. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at tne expense or any otner. It is simdv a steD. and a long step, to ward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing tne possibility or per manent peace on this hemisphere." The Ifavy. The president urges the continued up building of the navy as a means of per forming our international duties as well as a protection and safeguard for our inter national rights. He urges that our place as a first-class power necessitates the building and maintenance of a navy in keeping witn our place among tne nations of the world, and says: So far from being in any way a provo cation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guarantee against war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building and main taining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for Insurirg peace which una uobtuu uwwuij fj' He recommends both the construction of more ships and the addition of mora officers and men as absolutely necessary, and says: There should oe no cessation in tne work of completing our navy. So far in genuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery or the high seas, it is unsare ana unwise not to provide this year for several add! tional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion. For the exact number and character I refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy. But there is some thing we need even more than additional ships, and this is additional officers and men. To provide battleships and cruis ers and then lay tnem up, witn tne ex pectation of leaving them unmanned un til they are needed In actual war, would be worse than folly. It would be a crime against the nation. "To send any warship against a compe tent enemy unless those aboard It have been trained by years of actual sea serv ice, including incessant gunnery prac tice, would be to invite not merely dis aster, but the bitterest shame and humil iation, f our thousand additional sea men and a thousand add:onal marines should be provided, and an increase in the officers snouid be provided by making a large addition to tne classes at Annap olis. There is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious ar.d unmean ing title of "naval cadet' should be abol ished: the title of "midshipman, full of historic association, should be restored. Every detail ashore which can be per formed by a civilian should be so per formed, the officer being kept for his spe cial duty in tne sea service. Above all. gunnery practice snouid oe unceasing. It is important to nave our navy or ade quate size, but it is even more impor tant that, ship for ship, it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers, and this in turn im peratively demands continuous and re gressive Instruction in target practice. ship banding, squacron tactics and gen eral discipline. Our ships must be assem bled in squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at anchor. Th resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured. A battleship worn out in long training or omcers and men is well naid for by the results, while.' on the other hand, no matter in how excellent condition, it is useless 11 tne crew oe rot expert.' -we now nave 11 oatuesmps appropn ted for. of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are com missioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best vnnona are useless save in the hands of men -who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled un der a thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the re cruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be made to exact tne main iuncuon or tne omcer the command of men. The leading grad uates of the naval academy should be as. signed to the combatant branches, tha Una and marines." The -Army. No Increase In the regular army Is deemed necessary at this time, but there are several changes in that branch of the government service which the president recommends to congress. Chief of these is the establishment of a staff department, and of this he says: - ' "A general staff should be created. As for the general stalf and suppiy depart ments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men so detailed return ing after awhile to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed of men who have come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority. A system should be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade. Justice to ty r.t. e - ih. civil war who are still in th army would "ul LU require tnat m tne matter or re tirements they be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the navy."

His rec ommendation for this is as follows: vf J co"nend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to urn i-ismci ui vommDia or will at least enable the president thus to extend it.

The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth of the postal system and to the fact that the an. nuai aencii in this department of the gov- crnrafli service nas Den reaucea to the small sum of S3.923.7Z7. This, he savs. miiM further be increased and nossiblv a lurnhn shown but for the fact that many publi- vawuus arc nu w securing me pouna rate as secona-ciass mail matter which are not entitled to tne same under the law. Of this he says: "The full measure of postal progress whieh might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched, and well-understood abuses which have grown In con nection witn secona-ciass mall matter. The extent of this burden appears when It is stated mat, wnue tne secona-ciass mat- ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the maU, It paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,45 of the aggregate postal revenue of $111,631.11(3.. If the pound rate or postage, wnicn produces tne large loss thus entailed and which was fixed by the congress with the purpose of encouraging tne dissemination or public inrormation, were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law. no Just exception could be taken. That expense would b the recognized and accepted cost or a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for a Justifiable end. But much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law and has secured admis sion only through an evasion of its re quirements or through lax. construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of second class mail. If it be only one-third or one quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The post office department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and it should be sustained in its effort," Tne Chinese Dlfflealtles. ' He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese difficulties of last year, and this nation's part in the settlement, and says provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign representatives. Of the promises made by China he says: rne umnese government nas agreed to participate financially in the work of bet- tering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the centers of foreign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy board, in which the Chinese government is largely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the Shanghai river ' and the control of its navigation. In the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose ot substitut ing specific for ad valorem duties, and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain free ot duty, including Hour, cereals and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement."
