WM iVImj Sent by tlic War Departmeat Attn liut That Is Denied Aa "II" May Stop the Expedition. Washington, "December 8. Action has been taken by Secretary. Whitney which leaves no doubt of the policy of the govern ment with regard to the case of the Ameri can steamer Haytien Republic, recently seized at Port an Prince, Hayti. The release of the vessel has been demanded through the proper diplomatic channels, and if the demand is not complied with within a rea sonable period of time, step3 will be taken to enforce it With this end in view Secre tary Whitney sent telegraphic instructions to Rear Admiral Ghardi, commandant of the New York navy yard, to have the ships Richmond, Galena and Yantic prepared for sea as rapidly as possible. It was expected- that these vessels would be completed in about two weeks. The idea now is to have them ready so they can Bail direct for Hayti early next week. Orders have also been is sued for Rear Admiral Luce, commanding the North Atlantic steamer to transfer his flag from the Gelena to the Richmond and use that vessel as tho flag ship of . tho expe dition. Officials of the state department ara as usual reticent on the subject, nnd will not admit even, that the release of the Haytien Republic has been demanded. Secretary Whitney is more outspoken. When asked by an Associated Press reporter about the affair he admitted frankly that he had or dered the three naval vessels at New York to be gotten ready as soon as possible to start for Hayti. He added: "There is a local disturbance there, you know, and it is always a good plan to have naval vessels near at hand on such occa sions. You remember that the Haytien au thorities referred the case ot the soized st amer to this government. Well, we have rendered a decision, and that, in short, 13 that they have got to give her up. It is un fortunate that the yellow fever broke out on the Boston while sue was at Port-au-Prince and compelled her to leave that climate. Otherwise, the matter might have been set tled now. If it was not considered some what unsafe, we would send the Boston back to Hayti to aid the other vessels in case of necessity. That's all there is to it. We do not think the seizure of the vessel justi fied, and are therefore determined that she must ba delivered up to us." Orders were issued to the commander of the Norfolk navy yard to prepare the United States Ossipie for service as soon as possi ble. . It will take a little longer to do this than will be necessary with the three vessels at New York, but it is thought she can be fully prepared to follow them to Hayti with in a few days. She will be sent to Port an Prince unless something happens in the meantime to render it unnecessary. Secretary Endicott had an interview with Secretary Whitney and a rumor started that it had been decided to send a number of troops to Hayti to assist the naval forces, but it was subsequently ascertained that there was no foundation for the report. DIIiATOEY TACTICS. 1 Later It is learned that the action of Secretary Whitney in ordering a fleet of vessels to prepar9 for a trip to Hayti is due not so much to hostility to the request for the release of the American vessel Haytien Republic as to the dilatory tactics adopted by the Haytien authorities in dealing with the question. The position taken by this government is understood to be that as the Haytien authorities deferred the arbitration of the case to this government, they are vir tually bound by its decision and that then they were informed by this eovernment that they had no legal right to seize and de tain the Haytien Republic, they Bhould have aocepted the situation and released the ves sel. While they have not refused to do this, they are, it is said, acting in such a procras tinating way as to indicate a strong disin clination to accept the judgment against them. OBDEBED TO NEW TOEK. Boston, December 8. Orders havingbeen received from Washington for all the naval recruits at the Charleston navy yard to pro- csed at once to New York, 142 have gone there. Dun's Trade Review. New Yobk, December 7. R. G. Dun & Co., in their weekly review of trade say: Re ports of the condition of business note a confident feeling as to the future but many causes in different sections produce a slack ening for the present. Much uneasiness is felt in portions of the south, and collec tions are not above par, while failures in some southern districts are many. Memphis reports 0 per cent more than last year. Open and mild weather in the northwest causes uneasiness in some trades, particu larly in clothing and boots and shoes, at Kansas City and Milwaukee, and a lack of snow delays logging in Wisconsin. The money markets are nowhere dis turbed, but 7 and 8 per cent is paid at many western and southern centers, and 1 per cent per month at Salt Lake. The treasury report 6hows that the currency in circula tion,. though $51,700,000 less than November 1, was about $37,300,000 larger on December 1, than a year ago. During the past week the treasury has taken in $34,000,000 more than it has paid out. Imports for five weeks at New York have been only 3.6 per cent smaller, and exports from New York only 2.o per cent smaller tnan last year; yet ex ports of wheat from Atlantic ports were only 299,882 bushels, against 3,170i763 bush els in the same week last year; and of flour 598,297 barrels, against 187,669, with an in crease of 1,345,000 bushels in corn. Wheat closes higher than a week ago; com X cent lower; pork is 50 cents lower and hogs 20 cents per hundred pounds. Oil has'risen 2 cents; coffee cents and bids have declined 4 cent. The coal market reported active, prices 25 to 50 cents below the schedule. Wool ha advanced, the finer grades more than a cent since the middle of November. The average of 106 qualities is 24.8 cants, ageinst 24 cents November 15; 23 cents Oc tober 15; 24.1 cents December 1,1886. The belief that the crop and the stock on band have been below the estimates, grows preva lent. The iron market is cn-1 and waiting, with nrices a shade weaker at Pittsbaw. It is now reported that steel rails have bean sold for $25 at the null, but $25 at x-ittsomrgis said to be the bottom at Dresent Nails are dull at S1.90. bat bar iron is firmer.

A special from juacon, Mo., says all is quiet at .Bevier, Mo. where the riot occurred Wednesday night Sheriff Lyda and posse ordered the repre sentatives of the contending forces to keep off the street nt night under pain of arrest, and the sheriff's orders have thus- far been obeyed. Sheriff Lyda remained in Bevier lor the purpose of seeing that peace was maintained. a The sheriff is firmly convinced that there is now no remedy save the pres ence of the militia, until some adjustment of differences between mine owners and operatives can be reached. He expresses the opinion that unless the government acts promptly the disgraceful scenes of Wednes day night will be repeated. The Dudley Matter. Indianapolis, December 8. The federal building was again crowded with whisper ing witnesses, summoned to test fy before the grand jury. Tho jury reached the Dud ley case and several witnesses were before it. They remained in the roem an unusual ly longtime. Editor Morse, of the Senti nel, who is believed to be an important wit ness in the Dudley case, as the alleged Dud ley letter passed from his custody into the keeping of the federal authorities, was con spicuous about the ante-room of tho federal court. It is understood that he has been summoned as a witness, and will probably be called before the jury the first witness. The Evening News says of the Dudley case: "A telegram from Washington shows Col onel Dudley to be in a frame of mind over the 'block of five' business, and the antici pated investigation by the federal grand jury in this city, and he is quoted as saying with reference to the famous letter: 'When that letter first came out I said it was a for gery, as published, and I don't propose to make any further statements out of court.' Colonel Dudley also said that if he had any business in Indiana he should not hesitate to come to this state, and he intimated that Marshal Hawkins would be given an oppor tunity to place him under arrest within 3 few days. A Railroad Case. Washington, D. C, December 8. The secretary of the interior, sitting with the attorney general, heard the argument of the counsel on the part of the railroad company, in the case of the United States against the St Louis and San Francisco Railway com pany. The case came up upon the citation of the railroad company to show cause why patents to about 90,000 acres of land on the line of this road between Springfield, Mo., and the western boundary of the state, al leged to have been erroneously issued about twenty years ago, should not be canceled. The government claims that these lands were reserved to the United States by the. t act of June 10, 1852, and consequently did not pass to the Atlantic and Pacific Rail road company (of which the St. Louis and San Francisco is the successor) nnder its grant of July 27, 1866. Vice president John O'Day, of the St. Louis & San Fran cisco road, appeared as counsel for his com pany. It is stated that the lands in contro versy have long since passed out of the hands of the railroad company to settlers, who have, in many cases, sold them to oth ers. Mr. O'Day maintained that the origi nal grant, and the latter . the patents from the government, constituted an absolute and lncontestible title and that a recent decis ion of a United States court in a similar case established his position. The Threatened Resistance from tho Set tler. Fobt Dodoej'Io., December 8. The re maining writs of ejectment on Snell's lands will be placed in the hands of United States Marshal Holbrook at once for immediate execution. The pledge to resist further ejections at the point of death, made by the members of the settlers' union at a secret meeting held Sunday, will now be fully tes ted. This pledge was the result of indig nation at the fate of Nathan Barber, a member of the settlers' union, whose death was occasioned by exposure attendant upon ejectment from his home. This feeling of resistance was augmented by the news of congressional aotion, and any immediate eviction, it is feared, will precipitate a oil' max. Too Siek to Attend to Business. New York, December 8. The evidence 'was closed in the trial in the United States court of the suit of the trustees af the Paci fic Car trust againet the Iron Mountain rail way. Judge Wheeler received his decision, Amos Wheeler secretary of the roads of th9 southwestern system, was one of the wit nesses for the defendant He was asked concerning the health of Jay Gould. In response he said, Mr. Gould was too si ok to attend to business. He had been down only once in six or seven weeks, had not been in his office more than four times in six months, and had attended to no business in that time. Big Suits Commenced. 'Cabson Crrr, Nev.," December 8. The United States government, through the dis trict attorney, has entered suit against var ious corporations and individuals of Eureka of this state, aggregating about $13,000,000, for cutting wood and lumber off of nnsur veyed government land.
