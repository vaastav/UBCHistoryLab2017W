Apart from this our relations with the powers have been happy. Tile recent trouble© in China spring from -the anti-foreign agitation which for the past three years has gained strength Irii the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in. the character of the Chinese races -and- in the tradi tions of their govern-mejit. TJie Talping rebellion and the opening of .-Chinese ports to foreign trade wild settlement disturbed alike the iiomogenlty and the seclusion of China. Meojvwhlle foreign aclvity made itself felt all quarters, not alone on the coast, but along the gireat river arteries and In t'he remoter districts, carrying neiw 'ideas anxS introducing ne-.v asso ciations among a primitive people, twhlch had pursued for oonturies a na tional poWey of isolation. The telegraph and the railway spreading over t'heir land, the stc-a/mers plying their waterways, the merchant and .the missionary penetrating year by yoar farther to the Intterlor, became to the Ch1ne«e mind -types of an alien in vasion, changing the'course of their national life and fraught, -with vague forebodings of disaster -to their beliefs and -their self control. V«r several year* before tbr present' tercoursc, The diplomatic representatives of the powers in ivkii: strove in vuiti to check this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewed pro st, to be met with perfunctory edicts from til'? palace and evasive and• futile assurances from the tsung-li-yamen. The circle..or the Boxer influence nar rowed about I'ekin, and while nominally ^(,1,^ Our declared stigmati/.ed as seditious, it was feit that its spirit pervaded the capital it self, that* the imperial forces wore im bued with its doctrines, and that the immediate counselors of the empress dowagerwere in full sympathy with the anti-foreign movement. The increasing gfavity of the condi tions in'China- and the imminence of peril to our own diversi!i'-d interests The Chlrw.«e government proved, how ever, unable to check the rising strength of the Boxers and appeared to be a prey to' internal 'dtssenstohu. In the unequal contest the anti-foreign .influences soon gained the ascendancy under the lead ership of Price Tuan. Organized armies of Boxers, with which the imperial forces affiliated, held the* country be tween Pekin and the coast, penetrated into Manchuria up to the Kussian bor der, and thru their emissaries threat ened a like rising thruout northern Chi na. Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of their propc-rty and slaughter of native converts Were reported •1'rdm all fides. The Tsung-li-Yamen, already permeat ed with hostile pympathnes, could make no effective response to the appeals of the legations. At this critical juncture, In the early spring of this year, a pro posal way made by the other powers that a combined fleet should be assem bled ii: Chinese waters aa .a moral dem ons* ration. under cover of which to ex act of the Chines government'.respect for foreign treaty rights and the sup pression of the Boxers. The United State?, while not partici pating in the joint demonstration, promptly ser.t from the Philippines all ships that could be spared fbr service on the Chinese coast. Two days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict. Severance of communication with Pekin followed, and a combined force of addi tional guards, which was advancing to Pekin by the Pei-Ho, was chocked at Lang Fang. The isolation of the lega tions was complete. Relief of Legations. The siege and the relief of the lega tions have passed into history. In all the stirring chapter which records the heroism of the devoted band, clinging to hope in the face of despair, and the un daunted spirit that led their relievers thru buttle ar.d suffering to the goal, it la a memory of which my countrymen may be justly proud that the honor of our flag was maintained alike In the siege and tho rescue, and that stout American hearts have again set high, in fervent emulation with true men of other race and language, the indomita ble courage that ever rtrlves for the cause of right and Justice. 111 the empire, as well as to those of all other treaty governments, werir soon ap preciated by this government, causing it profound solicitude. The -United States cauao never so strongly intivm-hed In from the earliest days of foreign inter •the hearts of tiie people as n«w. The course, with China had followed a policy constitution, with few .amendment?, jof ieace, omitting no occasions to testi «xiKts as it left the 'hands of its au^jfy good-will, to further, the extension thors.

Chinese Question. the benefits of equality of treatment.of all foreign tr.-Vde thruout China. With gratifying unanimity the re sponses coincided in this common policy, enabling me to see in the successful ter mination of these negotiations proof of thi- friendly .spirit which animates the various powers interested in the un tramnteled development of commerce ard Industry in the Chinese empire as a "puree of vast benefit to the whole com mercial* world. In this conclusion, which I had the gratification to announce as a complet ed engagement to tiie Interested powers on March 20. I hop? fully discerned a po tential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policy of the imperial government, and for the effective exertion by it of power and authority to quel! the critical anti forelgn movement In the northern prov inces most immediately influenced by the Manchu santiment. Trusted Chinesi Government. fc-ceking to testify confidence in the willlngnesa and ability of the imperial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils w© suffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Pekin in the autumn of 1899 for the protection of the legation, was withdrawn at the earliest practicable moment, and all pending questlons.were remitted, as far as we were concerned, to the ordinary reports of diplomatic in- Then follows an account of that siege. United States Policy. The policy of the United States thru all this trying period was clearly an nounced a.nd scrupulously carried out.

The legations forward a .$ug®esJiofi. reported the development of the setli tious movement in Pekin and'.the need of increased provision for defense against it. While preparations were in proses**- for a larger expedition, to strengthen the legation guards and keep the railway open, an attempt of'th« for eign ships to '."make- a landing at Taku was met by afire from the Chinese forts. Thv forts were thereupon shelled by the foreign vessels, the American admiral taking no. part, in the attack, on the ground that wo were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration miuht consolidate the anti-foreign ele ments and s-trengthen the Boxers to op pose the relieving column. inces of the south and southeast had no .„• share, we regarded the local authoritips in the latter- quarters as representing the Chinese peoile with whom we: sought to remain in peace and frienfi aims involved no war against the Chinese nation. We adhered to the legitimate ofliee of res cuing the Imperiled legation, obtaining redress for wrongs already 'suffered, se curing wherever pos" ble tli-- satVty of •American life and property in China and preventing a.spread of the disorders or their recurrence. As was tir-n said, "the policy-of the government of the Cnifed States is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and admin istrative entity. protect'all rights guar anteed to friendly power* by treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the principle of equal-arid impar tial trade'with all parts of the Chinese empire." Faithful to those professions which, as il proved, reflected the views and pur poses of the other co-operating govern ments. all our efforts have been directed toward ending the anomalous situation in China by negotiations for a settle ment at the earliest possible moment.: As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our k-gnt/on and its dependents was ac complished we withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Pekin as a chan nel of negotiation and settlement—a course adopted by others of the Inter ested powers. Overtures of the empow ered representatives of the Chinese em peror have been considerately enter tained. The Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the imperial power in Pe kin has b°en accepted as in full conso nance with our own desires, for we have held and hold that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an enduring settlement that will make their recur rence impossible can best be brought about under an authority which the Chi nese nation reverences and obeys. While so doing we forego 110 jot of our un doubted right to exact exemplary ar.d detfi-rent punishment of the responsible nuthoi-B and abettors- of the criminal actswhereby we and other nations have suffered grievous injury. I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as we and the other offended gov ernments shall be effectively satisfied of your majesty's ability and power to tieat with just sternness the principal offenders, who are doubly culpable, not alone toward the foreigners, but toward your majesty, under whose rule the pur pose of China to dwell in concord with the world had hitherto found expression In the welcome and protection assured to strangers. French Ideas the Basis. General bases of negotiation formu lated by the government ot the French republic have been accepted with cer tain reservations as to details, made necessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations by other powers, open to discussion In the prog ress of the negotiations. The disposi tion of the emperor's government to ad mit liability for wrongs done to foreign governments and their nationals, and to act upon such additional designation of the guilty persons as th* foreign min ister* at Pekin may be is a soaltiop to 4w- §§f in
