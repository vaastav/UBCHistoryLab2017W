YOLFME 96.-NO. 110. MONEY FOR THE ARMY AND NAVY. The Urgent Deficiency Bill Passed by the House. Provides for the Support of the Military and Naval Establishments. Hot a Word of Criticism of the War During tke Debate, tke Democratic Leaders Deciding Tkat Suck Discussion Would Properly Come Later Wken Regular Appropriations and Army Reorganization Bills Are Taken Up. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The urgent deficiency bill to provide for the support of the military and naval establish ments was passed by the House to-day, practically without opposition. A fear had been expressed that the measure might open up a prolonged debate upon the* conduct of the war, but the Demo cratic leaders decided that such a de bate would properly come later upon the regular appropriation bills, or upon the bill for the reorganization of the army. There was not a word of criti cism of the war during the debate. The only point upon which an issue was raised to-day was as to whether the bill, providing as it did, for the pay of the volunteers until July 1, 1899, might not be construed as a modification of the law under which the volunteers were mustered into service. Mcßae (Ark.) offered an amendment providing that it should not be so con strued, and upon it there was a general discussion as to the advisability of mus tering the volunteers out before the reg ular army was increased. Mr. Cannon finally accepted the Mcßae amendment, and that removed the only shadow of opposition to the bill. A number of amendments were adopt ed upon the recommendations of the Appropriations Committee, which re ceived some supplemental estimates after the bill was prepared. The larg est of these was an item of $3,000,000 fof an emergency fund for the War De partment, $578,000 for the Ordnance Department, increasing the amount by the bill to $09,859,892. The conference report upon the bill to render the sureties ofConsuls, Vice Consuls and Consular agents liable for damages in suit at law, was adopted Sir. Wilfred Laurier, Premier of Canada: Lord Herschell, Sir Louis Da vis and James Winter, Premier of New* | foundland, members of the High Com-; mission, occupied seats in the gallery of the House to-day, being the guests of Dingley, the floor leader of the ma jority, who is a member of the commis sion. They seemed greatly interested in the proceedings and procedure. Dingley pointed out to them the cele brities of the House. On motion of Chairman Cannon of the Appropriations Committee, the House went into committee of the whole im mediately after the reading of the jour nal, to read the urgent deficiency bill for the support of the military and na val establishments during the six months beginning January 1, 1899. Underwood (D.) of Alabama interro gated Cannon, with a view to receiving a statement of the disposition to be made of the volunteer army. Cannon said the treaty of peace might be ratified in January; it might not be ratified for months. No one could ten what was in front of us. We must deal with a situation. The volunteer army might be mustered out and its place taken by the regular army. That was a matter for the future to decide, but he felt confident»that the Treasury would be rich enough, and Congress wise enough, to meet any emergency. Sayers (D.) of Texas, the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee, gave his unqualified in dorsement of the bill, which, he said, did not affect in any way the legisla tion regarding the volunteer or regular armies. It simply made appropriations to support the present naval and mili tary establishment. The bill was based on the theory that the volunteers would continue in the service until July 1, 1899. If they were mustered out, the appropriation would be covered back into the Treasury. Livingston (D.) of Georgia expressed the opinion that the law under which the volunteers were mustered into serv ice was subject to double construction as to the time when they should be mustered out, and he believed, if the President was disposed to keep the volunteers in the service until the reg ular army had been reorganized, this bill appropriating money for their pay ment would strengthen his hand. Mcßae (D.) of Arkansas gave notice that at the proper time he would offer an amendment declaring that nothing in the pending bill should construe, ex tend or modify section 4 of the Act of April 22d. creating the volunteer army. He said he would not have pressed the amendment had it not been for the President's declaration in his message that he would muster out the .volunteer army as soon as the regular establish ment was increased. It was unjust to the volunteers to hold them in the service, when Congress had given a, sol emn pledge that they should be mus tered out as soon as the war ended. He believed it' was the purpose of the Pres ident to hold the volunteers until a large standing army was provided. •The army on a peace footing num bers but 20,000," interposed Cannon. "Does the gentleman and his side of the House stand ready to support a bill to increase that army to meet the ne cessities of the Government in its pres ent emergency and those which con front it?" "We will meet that question when it arises," replied Mcßae. "We are op posed td a large standing army, and we are opposed to holding the volun teers to perform the duty of regulars., and be used as a club to force us to create a large standing army." Cox (D.) of Tennessee contended that, under the law. the volunteers were en titled to their discharge the moment THE 

RECORD-UNION. hostilities ceased. He supported the Mcßae amendment, as did Bland. Dockery (D.) of Missouri, a member of the Appropriations Committee, dif fered from his colleague, Livingston. He did not believe that the pending bill could possibly be construed to mod ify the Volunteer Act. Fleming declared that the volunteers had enlisted under the promise that they would be discharged when the war was over. He could not understand why the Chairman of the Appropria tions Committee should oppose the Mc- Rae amendment, which simply provid ed that nothing in the pending bill should construe or modify the Act of April 22d. Cannon said he saw no good purpose that would be subserved by its incor poration. It would simply give some gentlemen on the other side an oppor tunity to flap their wings and proclaim with sound and fury their friendship for the volunteers. (Laughter.) De Armond (D.) of Missouri advocat ed the adoption of the Mcßae amend ment. The President, he said, could not transform the volunteers into uni formed policemen, if Congress in its -wisdom decided otherwise. The whole question was a mere quibble as to whether the universal understanding of the 100,000 men who had enlisted that they should be discharged when hos tilities ceased was now to be abandon ed and the volunteers held to do police duty in different parts of the world. General debate upon the bill was then closed upon Cannon's motion, and the bill was read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Cannon offered a committee amend ment for an emergency fund of $3,000, --000 for the War Department. He said it was impossible to see what contin gencies might and probably would arise in the next six months. An emer gency fund of $1,000,000 was provided for the Navy Department. The amendment was adopted. King (D.) of Utah offered an amend ment to limit the appropriation for the payment of the volunteers for the per iod prior to March 31, 1899. He thought it the imperative duty of the President to muster out the volunteers as soon as peace was declared. The amendment was lost without di vision. Allen (D.) of Mississippi offered an amendment providing that the money appropriated in the bill for the pay of' volunteers should not be available lon ger than three months after ratifica tion of a treaty of peace. It was de feated —51 to 71. On motion of Cannon, several com mittee amendments were adopted. The appropriation of the current ex penses of the ordnance service was in creased from $50,000 to $100,000; for the manufacture of metallic ammuni tion, marksmen's medals, insignia, etc from $200,000 to $400,000; for the pur chase and manufacture of ordnance stores, from $62,000 to $250,000; for in fantry, cavalry and artillery equipment from $00,000 to $150,000, and for the manufacture of arms at national arm ories, etc., from $275,000 to $325,000. These increases, Cannon explained, had been recommended by the Chief of Ordnance. Cannon then accepted the Mcßae amendment. Without further amendment the bill was reported to the House and passed without division. Cannon moved that when the House adjourn to-day it be until Monday next, explaining that the adjournment would give the committee an opportu nity to work. The motion was agreed to. Shafroth of Colorado asked unani mous consent for the consideration of the bill for the reclamation of arid lands. Hepburn of lowa objected. A conference report on the bill re lating to the bonds of Consuls, Vice Consuls and Consular Agents was adopted. At 4:20 p. m. the House adjourned until Monday. IN THE 

SENATE WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The Senate held a short session to-day, and ad journed until Monday, after making the Nicaraguan Canal bill the unfinished business before that body. Morgan called up the measure, whereupon Pet tigrew moved to adjourn. This motion failed, thirteen ayes to forty-two nays, and the bill was brought forward. Ad journment was immediately taken. During the session Vest stated his opposition to the hurried manner of passing pension bills in the Senate, and gave notice that he would insist upon a quorum being present when pension bills were being acted' upon. In connection with the consideration of bills on the pension calendar. Vest said: "I do not want to be captious about this pension business, and do not ! want to set myself up as a reformer, but this thing of passing a lot of pen sion bills simply by the reading of the titles and when a quorum of the Sen ate is not present has go{ to be stopped." After further referring to the methods by which pension bills are passed by the j Senate, Vest said: "Men of the South have permitted these bills to be passed, having some delicacy about entering ] objections to the course of procedure. Recent events have obliterated section alism, and we are united. We can, therefore, come here and object to this spoliation, and I use the word advisedly, without fear of having our motives im pugned or our words misconstrued. We are paying out in round figures $141, --000,000 annually for pensions and it is our duty to find out why it is that thirty-three years after the close ct the i civil war this thing of pension claims j shows so enormous a sum. I have been ■ criticised by some of my, people because 1 have not taken a more determined stand on this pension question. I want, however,.to pay munificently and liberally in pensions. I regard such payment as a sacred duty, but I do ob ject to the passage of these bills with out proper consideration, and with the same restrictions that are hedged abrjut other measures." Gallinger of New Hampshire, as Chairman of the Pension Committee, agreed with Vest In his desires to h£ve the pension bills carefully considered. He thought a quorum of the Senate ought to be in attendance when the pension calendar was considered. During the consideration of bills on the pension calendar Caffery of Lou isiana introduced this resolution: "That it is the sense of the Senate of the United States that the President enter into negotiations with the Gov ernment of Great Britain for the pur pose of modifying the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so far and to the extent the same may be deemed to prevent the United States from owning, constructing, con (Continued on Sixth Page.) 

SACRAMENTO, FRIDAY MORIS ESG, UfcCEMBER 9, 1898.-EIGHT PAGES. CUBANS IN STATE OF GREAT EXCITEMENT. Result of Disturbances at Santiago on Wednesday During a Celebration in Commemoration of the Death of Antonio Maceo. A Captain in the Cnban Army, Who Led Two Negro Compan ions Into a Spanish Club and Proceeded to Wreck tke Prem ises, Placed Under Arrest by a Colonel of tke American Forces. SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. B.—The Cubans here are greatly excited over yesterday's proceedings resulting from the commemoration of the death of Antonio Maceo, particularly at the fact that bullets reached the camp of the Fifth Immunes, which proves that the shots were not fired by the Cubans who fired volleys in the air from the public square here. It now seems that the bullets which struck the tents of the immunes came from a different par ty of insurgents, near the trocha, who were also celebrating. Regarding the action of the three drunken Cubans who entered the Span ish Club and smashed chandeliers and furniture, the Cubans say they deeply deplore the outrage, and do not think it fair to look upon it as a race act. The San Carlos Club intends to hold a meet ing, and to tender an apology to the Spanish Club. The police are blamed for*' not making any arrests. Colonel Beacom, the American act ing military commander here, accom panied by the Chief of Police, person ally arrested Juan Costillo this morn ing. He is a Captain in the Cuban army, and was the man who led his two negro companions into the club. Colonel Costillo, who is well connected, objected to going to jail, and offered his card instead. Colonel Beacom, how ever, was obdurate. There has been great rejoicing to-day in connection with the fete Purisimma Concepcion. Yesterday's mourning em blems were exchanged for glorious dec orations in the Cathedral and sorrow ful music gave way to joyous. Abbe Bernardo preached an eloquent sermon to a congregation that crowded the Cathedral. In inspiring words he call ed upon all Cubans to rejoice upon the the termination of the 400 years of cruelty, extortion and misery-, and show their gratitude to the United States for the happy consummation. He eulogized General Governor of the Mili tary Department of Santiago, saying that he rejoiced to hear that General Wood's name had been sent to the United States Senate with a recom mendation that he be raised to the rank of Major General. "And I can only hope," said the priest, "that General Wood's name will be sent a week later with a recommendation that he be ap pointed a Lieutenant General, and be made Governor General of the island of Cuba during the American military occupation." The "Independencia," an enterprising local sheet, published 500 words of tele graphic resume of President McKin ley's message to Congress, which was the topic of conversation at all clubs and other centers of interest. With the exception of the extremists—the party advocating the immediate freedom of Cuba and the establishment forthwith of a Cuban government—all factions are, apparently, well satisfied with the promises of the message regarding the island. 

AFFAIRS AT HAVANA. HAVANA, Dec. 7 (via Key West, Dec. B).—The statue of Isabel La Catholica, w-hich stands in the middle of Central Park, this city, was found this morning holding a valise in one hand and a steamer rug in the other. An immense placard was slung across the back of the statue with the words "Bon voyage" inscribed on it. Serious problems confront the last days of Spain's sovereignty in Cuba. One of the most delicate and most dif ficult of solution is the question of re turn bonds given by civil officials and employes upon ceasing to hold office. Many of these are cash bonds furnished years ago, the refunding of which now becomes imperative. All such moneys having been appropriated and spent, the Government is unable to meet these obligations or to fulfill the guarantees. The settlement of the arrears of pay due the mobilized and irregular iroops showed masterly financiering on the part of the military intendant. With money in hand for full settlement of all pay due the troops, the Quartermaster Gen eral devised an ingenious plan. Pay ing the men off in notes payable in Madrid, he offered through trusted agents to discount such notes at 20 or 30 per cent, for cash. As practically every one of the irregular and mobilized troops will remain on the island, the men eagerly embraced this opportunity to have their notes cashed, and a hand some profit therefore accrued co the astute originator of the scheme. The first mortgages held by the Span ish Bank on municipal property here amounted to $0,000,000. Proposi tions for the acquisition of these mort gages have been made by London, New York and Berlin bankers. Although the mortgaged property represents a most solid investment, the Spanish Bank appears ready to transfer the title to the foreign corporations through a lack of confidence in the stability of the future government. Several disturbances occurred here yesterday afternoon between a number of Spaniards and Cubans, and luckily there was no serious consequence. At § o'clock in the afternoon of the day mentioned several Cuban officers, who were walking down Obispo street, asked each other in tones rather louder than necessary when the Spaniards were finally to leave Cuba and commented on what they termed* the letter's want of shame in parading the streets attired in their uniforms. A couple of Spanish officers who chanced to pass overheard the conversation of the Cubans and one of the Spaniards approached and slap ped the face, of a member of the Cuban party. Blows were exchanged, but the fighters were soon arrested and taken to the Military Governor's palace, where they were subsequently dis charged. A repetition of this incident occurred in the evening, when a Spanish officer in Central Park tore a bandana off a Cuban's head and cut it into pieces with his sword. The offender was arrested, and General Arolas, fearing further trouble, distributed a force of soldiers in the park and its vicinity. No other disturbances occurred, however. GENERAL WADE MAY BE MILI TARY GOVERNOR. HAVANA, Dec. 8— (8:25 p. m.)— M ajor General James F. Wade, President of the United States Evacuation Com mission, has received certain instruc tions from President McKinley which indicate that he will be appointed Mili tary Governor of Western Cuba. A for mal announcement is daily expected from Wshington, though it may be de layed until the time comes for the change of the flags. General Greene will be Governor of the city of Havana. He has already virtually taken hold, as he is having some of the streets cleaned and is de vising measures for the sanitation and policing of the city. The preparation for a change of flags is thus being brought about by degrees, and the transition will not be abrupt. Already the evacuation of the province of Havana is complete, except for the troops stationed in the city. Of these there are 12,000. General Castellanos does not fix a date for their withdrawal earlier than January Ist, but they will probably retire to Gienfuegos before Christmas. Admiral Sampson's departure waits upon the arrival of General Butler from the United States next week, as it is thought best to have two Commission ers here. Secretary Long has instruct ed Admiral Sampson to leave whenever it suits his convenience. General Castellanos received a cable order yesterday to draw on Paris for $1,500,000 with which to pay his troops. To-day being the "Feast of the Im maculate Conception," the American war vessels in the harbor dressed ship, displaying Spanish flags. 

HAWAIIAN ISLANDS BILL. Before tke Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held a meeting to-day to consider the bill reported by the Hawaiian Commission for the government of the Hawaiian Islands. - The bill was only considered in a very general way, the committee de ciding to postpone the detail work up on it for a week. This decision was reached because the full report of the committee had not been printed. At the meeting next Wednesday the meas ure will be taken up, section by sec tion, and the whole matter will be very carefully considered, with the view of presenting it in as perfect shape as possible to the Senate. Senators Cullom arid Morgan, who are members of the commission and also members of the committee, were present at to-day's meeting, and ex plained many of the* general features of the bill. No opposition developed at to-day's meeting. The committee authorized a favor able report on the joint resolution for the extension of the Mexican boundary treaty for a year. While no disposition was manifested to make any opposition to. the Hawaiian bill as a whole, J some of -the members of the committee indicated a desire to amend it in some particulars. Senator Turpie was among those who showed such a disposition. His objection to the bill, as reported, was on account of the provision for a Congressional delegate. The supporters of the bill indicated a willingness to strike out this provision, and it looks as if this will be done. 

EPIDEMIC OF SMALLPOX. Two Hundred Cases at Bedford, Pennsylvania, HUNTINGDON (Pa.), Dec. B.— Among Bedford's population of 2,800 there are about 200 cases of what is said to be genuine smallpox. This alarming condition of affairs was dis covered yesterday, and up to that time there continued an uninterrupted com mingling of the citizens of the town. The disease prevails from one end of the town to the other. The Bedford physicians disagree, some pronouncing it to be chlckenpox and others a harmless skin disease. Dr. Atkinson, State Health Inspector, says it is gen uine smallpox. Men, women and chil dren, he declares, with smallpox crusts on their bodies and faces, have been traveling the streets day and night, and visiting from house to house, un conscious of the true nature of their affliction. The whole town is now closely quarantined, policed and guard ed, and vigorous measures will be prosecuted to check the plague. The danger to the whole central part of the State is manifest, as people of Bedford, while infected with the dis ease, have been traveling far and near. George Martin, a member of Com pany A, Fifth Regiment of Hunting don, who is afflicted with smallpox, contracted the disease while playing football in Bedford from an opposing Bedford player, who at the time showed the crusts of smallpox on his face. CONTRACT SCHOOL SYSTEM. Cardinal Gibbons Asks That tke Question be Reopened. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. — Cardinal Gibbons, in behalf of himself and the Archbishops of the Catholic Church in America, has submitted a petition to Congress asking that the question of the contract school system be re opened, and that Congress again go over the whole subject of Indian edu cation. The petition asks that a Congres sional inquiry be made in place of the departmental inquiries, in order that the merits and defects of contract schools and Government schools may be shown, and "not kept as a secret of State concealed in the files of any department or bureau.". Representative Sherman, Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Af fairs, is in favor of granting the prayer that an investigation be made. National Farmers* Congress. FORT WORTH (Texas), Dec. B.—Hon. D. C. Purse of Savannah, Ga., addressed the Farmers' National Congress to-day. His subject was "Railway Discrimina tion." TERMS OF PEACE FINALLY SETTLED. Work of the American and Spanish Commissioners Completed. Only Remains for Signatures to Be At tached to the Document. The Treaty Will he Formally Signed as Soon as Engrossed Under the Supervision of the Two Secretaries, To-Morrow or Monday Next—The Spaniards Exceedingly Bitter Over the Result of the Negotiations. PARIS, Dec. B.—The United States and Spanish Peace Commissioners con cluded their work to-day, and finally settled the terms of the treaty of peace. They will meet once more in formal session on Saturday or Monday next, when the Spanish Commissioners, sor rowfully, and the Americans, with feel ings of relief, will write their signa tures upon the document which embod ies the results of the war, and the pre paration of which has consumed eleven weeks, a longer time than the war it self. In the meantime the treaty will be engrossed, under the supervision of Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda, the Secre taries of the respective commissions. The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter over the result, though observing the forms of friendliness and courtesy. Montero Rios, whose strong and per sistent struggle to save for his country every possible asset from the wreck of her colonial empire, has commanded the respect and admiration of his oppo nents, went from the council chamber to-day to his bed in a state of complete collapse, as the result of the long strain and his chagrin over the small fruits of his efforts. Senor Ojeda has been prostrated since yesterday, and was unable to attend the joint session to day. The Spaniards charge equal blame upon the European Powers and the United States for their downfall. One of the Spanish Commissioners said this evening: "The European nations have made a great mistake in deserting Spain and leaving her to spoliation by the brute force of a conscienceless giant. They all know that in the Philippines Amer ica has taken more than she can di gest. She will ultimately sell the isl ands to England or Germany, and when the transfer is made they will precipi tate a general European strife. We have refused to sell any island in the Carolines. We never thought of con sidering an offer. Nor have we con sented to negotiate upon any questions except those directly involved in the protocol signed at Washington." The members of the commission say the treaty will contain little outside I the scope of the Washington protocol and the matters directly based thereon, like the provisions for the evacuation of the ceded territories, the transfer of public property therein, and guarantees of the safety of the property and rights of the Spanish citizens remaining there. The details of the last class of ques tions covered by the statement which the Americans handed to Senor Rios at the last meeting, were considered to day, but all the Commissioners refuse to divulge the details of the conference. Several points upon which they were unable to agree were left open for diplo matic negotiations. The Spaniards refuse to admit that they had failed to respect former treat ies guaranteeing religious freedom in the Caroline Islands, or that there was a necessity for new guarantees. The conclusion of the work was, ac cording to the Commissioners, marked by politeness and all outward evidences of good feeling and relief at the fact that the task was accomplished. When all the propositions had been : discussed Judge Day, President of the American Commission, remarked: "There seems to be nothing more to do but to engross and sign the treaty." Senor Montero Rios, President of the Spanish Commission, acquiesced to this, i and the Americans bowed themselves out before the Spaniards, according to their custom. The American Peace Commissioners entered the joint conference to-day in a nervous frame of mind. They evidently had reasons to believe that a possibil ity existed, even at this late hour, that there might be a rupture. This feeling of apprehension was based on the tem per the Spaniards have displayed lately. This week the Commissioners of Spain did not conceal the fact that, having failed to gain all the important points, they were indifferent as to whether or not the conferences resulted in a settle ment of peace by the signing of a treaty by which! Spain loses all her colonies. A miscarriage of the negotiations would leave their political prestige at home no worse, if not in a better posi tion than if they signed the treaty. The Americans were anxious not to give the Spaniards any pretext to break off the negotiations, or take offense, so far as the exercise of patience and diplomacy could steer clear of protests. The Madrid papers are disposed to re vive the question of the Maine, and to excite public opinion against the United States, on account of the" refer ence to this by the President. They re port that Senor Montero Rios, President of the Spanish Commission, made an impassioned denunciation of President McKinley at the last joint meeting. But these reports are practically without foundation. Senor Rios did refer to the Maine, but oniy In calmly worded, sentences, expressing regret that the President had spoken, as the Spaniards thought, unjustly of them. The Span iards had already proposed at this con ference to have the responsibility of the destruction of the Maine reported upon by a joint commission of the Eu ropean Powers. The American Com missioners refused to listen to this, and permitted Senor Rios' references to the President's message to pass unchal lenged, as a discussion would have pro voked debate and bad blood. Diplomatic circles in Paris predict, as one of the results of the treaty, a diplo matic contest between France and the United States, which will have an im portant chapter in history. The French Government is reported to have re solved to take up the case of the French holders of Cuban bonds, and it is believed France will declare that the repudiation of the bonds is the result of the treaty which the victorious na tion imposed upon Spain. They argue that through the treaty responsibility has been shifted upon America, and therefore the French Government will endeavor to exact some pledge for the payment or guarantee of the bonds. 

SPANISH ARE INDIGNANT. MADRID, Dec, B.— The "Imparcial" to-day says the Spanish Government yesterday decided to telegraph Senor Montero Rios, President of the Spanish Peace Commission at Paris, instruct ing him to again protest against Pres ident McKinley's reference to the Maine in his recent message to Con gress. Continuing, the "Imparcial" says there is great indignation at the Amer ican Commissioners' rejection of Senor Rios' request for a neutral investiga tion into the cause of the loss of the Maine. A semi-official note just issued says: "Spain has been treated by the con queror with unexampled cruelty, and is resigned to her fate; but she cannot tolerate President McKinley's accusa tion, for she is conscious of her com plete innocence. It is understood that the Government has decided to end the Paris conference, on the ground that the decision of secondary ques tions is impossible." 

INSULAR WIRE SERVICE. The Government Owns Telegraph Lines in Porto Rico. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The situa tion in Porto Rico promises to force on this Government, for a time at least, the experiment of Federal ownership of telegraph and telephone lines. The War Department now controls all lines in Porto Rico and in the evacuated sec tions of Cuba. The latter, however, is looked upon as merely transient. In both places the lines are being repaired, and this Government is handling com mercial messages after Government matter. The signal service in charge of this work says it is too soon to draw con clusions as to the expense of the ser vice, as the costs for maintenance and long delayed repairs is just now more than the income from the lines. But in six months from the Ist of January the signal service expects to be able to furnish some interesting data as to the profit in the insular wire service. The military occupation of the lines will naturally continue until the estab lishment of a civil government, and considerable interest is expressed as to how the management of the lines will be disposed of eventually, or whether it will be permanently retained by the Government. This enforced object lesson in Federal management is naturally expected to have considerable influence pro or con in the agitation for like control in this country. The signal office reports the commercial business on the island wires light at present, owing to dis turbed business conditions, but what there is is expeditiously and satisfac torily handled by the Government. Tel ephone lines are being substituted for telegraph instruments on most of the purely military lines, but the work of reconstruction in Cuba is very slow, as it is at least ten years behind in repairs. The latest military line under construction is from Nuevitas to Santa Cruz, fifty miles. FAILED TO AGREE. The Jury in the Cody Blackmailing Case Discharged. ALBANY (N. V.), Dec. B.—The jury in the Cody blackmailing case, after being out twenty-five hours, has failed to reach an agreement and has been discharged. To the question put by the court when the jury came into court at (5:20 p. m., as to whether there was any possibility of reaching an agreement, Foreman Van Berger said that it was beyond all reasonable consideration. Mrs. Cody was remanded to jail. The jury took twelve ballots. On the first ballot it stood eight to four for conviction. Those who held out for acquittal were Charles Radick and Abram Jansen, farmers of Preston Hollow, and Charles Schade, a roofer of Albany. Immigration Bill. WASHINGTON. Dec. B.—Chairman Danforth of the Immigration Commit teee, after talking with House leaders, says he will not urge the immigration bill until more members arrive, as it is felt the passage of the measure bo endangered by having it go to a vote with a small attendance. |dr. Dan forth anticipates a sharp contest, for in addition to the uprising when the bill was in the Senate, the acquisition of the Philippines, Porto Rico and other out lying territories promise to develop new phases of the immigration subject. Bank Robbery in Illinois. ST. LOUIS, Dec. B.—A special to the "Post-Dispatch" from Arrowsmith, 111., says that the private bank of Taylor & McClure was last night entered by rob bers, who secured $4,000 worth of ne gotiable paper and escaped. They used dynamite on the safe, which was wrecked. Bloodhounds are being used to track the robbers. Stay of Proceedings. PARIS, Dec. B.—The Court of Cas sation this afternoon ordered a stay of proceedings in the Plcquart court-mar tial. Several of the newspapers here assert that the Court of Cassation has examined the secret documents in the Dreyfus case. Mexican Boundary Question. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. — The Sen ate in executive session to-day ratified the treaty for the extension of the time for the completion of the Mexican boundary one year. There was no op position and no debate. Cost of Propagation of Food Fish. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—A report submitted to Congress by the Commis sioner of Fish and Fisheries shows an expenditure of $187,800 for the propa gation of food fish during the fiscal year ended June 30th last. Score in tke Bicycle Race. NEW YORK, Dec. 9.—ln the six-day bicycle race the score of the five lead ers at 2 a m. were: Miller 1,473, Wal ler 1,470, Pierce 1,401, Albert 1,420*, Stevens 1.356* WHOLE NO. 17,952. INQUIRY INTO WAR METHODS. Conduct of the Medical Service of the Army Taken Up. Surgeon General Sternberg Rigidly Ques tioned by the Commission. The Medical Department Hampered at the Beginning of the War by the Action of Congress From Year to Year Reducing Esti mates He Had Submitted, in a Policy of Economy in Appro priations. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—The con duct of the medical service of the army was taken up to-day by the War In vestigation Commission, and Surgeon General Sternberg war rigidly ques tioned about his administration. The medical depart'nent, he said, was equipped only for an army of 25, --000 men when the war broke out, and from year ,to year the estimates he had submitted had been materially re duced by Congress in a policy of economy of appropriation. As soon as there was a prospect of war he had begun preparations, though not mak ing any expense. He had models of chests made, he said, and equipment developed, but when he suggested to Secretary Alger'the propriety of mak ing purchases for his service the policy; was to "wait." He said at ene time there were as many as 050 contract surgeons em -1 ployed. The appointees were mostly from 30 to 40 years old, with hospital or active professional experience, but when permanent camps were estab lished in this country he did not know they were to be permanent. He con ceded it was a mistake not to have appointed more contract surgeons from those who had experience in the Civil War, for their experience would have been valuable, but he was ignorant at the outset of the permanency of the camps. The regimental surgeons, he said, were good, bad and indifferent, but he recollected no instance of dis missal for incompetence. Threshing over the controversy be tween regimental and division hospi tals, he credited the establishment of the latter to their success in two years' experience of the Civil War. At the outset the maximum capacity of division hospital was 260 beds, but this capacity was quickly found far inadequate. He could not recollect whether the chief surgeon at Camp Thomas had .reported that the sanitation was bad. '"The department now, he said, has ample evidence that typhoid cases dur ing the war were largely mistaken for malarial fever until the cases reached the division hospital, and that malaria also had been diagnosed as typhoid. General Sternberg's recollection was* that prior to the inspection tour of the camps by Secretary Alger, Quarter master General Ludington and him self, the information in his hands of unsanitary conditions of Camp Thomas was unofficial. He acknowledged the services of volunteer aid associations, and said the trained female nurses were satisfactory, though he had re ceived some reports to the contrary. He admitted a real deficiency in med ical supplies at times. He contended, however, that there had been very lit tle lack of medical supplies during the war, the great difficulty being that surgeons frequently preferred other than the "field supplies," and an un anticipated typhoid fever outbreak had also considerably taxed the field re sources. Coming to the history of the Santi ago movement, General Sternberg ex plained that there had been an abun dance of medical officers and supplies sent to Santiago, and that the trouble, so far as he could judge, arose in, their landing and distribution. General Beaver —Were you at any time hampered in the discharge of the duties of your office by your su periors in the department? General Sternberg hesitated consid | erably, and said: "No; certainly not to any appreciable extent." There was a pause, and General Sternberg hastened to add: "You will understand that one man cannot do everything at once, and there were oc casional delays in getting the car of the Secretary, but nothing beyond this." "Then," said General Beaver, "we are to understand you had at all times the hearty support and good will of those over you in forwarding the work of your department?" "Yes," was the reply; "most undoubt edly." As to the general condition of troops in mobilization camps, he said the trouble could nearly all be summed in the two phrases: "Neglect of sanitary measures," and "letting the troops re main too long in one camp." Touching the subject of female nurses. General Sternberg said, seri ously but sadly, that "they were ex pensive luxuries." He said the War Department was getting requisitions now for bureaus, rocking-chairs and other things which were unknown under the male nurse regime. Appointments by the President.
