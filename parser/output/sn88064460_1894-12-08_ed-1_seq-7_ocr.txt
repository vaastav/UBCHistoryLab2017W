A man who did not know how to read c` and write, convicted of a slight of fense, was sentenced to imprisonment until he bad learned to read. Another offender, who had a good education, C was sentenced to keep him company ir until he had taught him to read. P After three weeks they were dis- i1 charged, as they had fulfilled their tl task to the full satisfaction of the fi magistrate. d Most Honorable Death. The most honorable death in China s is by strangulation, and high officials r condemned to death receive their sen- t tences from the emperor in the shape t of a silken cord with which they hang 1 themselves.

Still Preserved, There is preserved by a private family in Baltimore Major Robert Kirkwood's certificate as a member of the Society of the Cincinnati.
