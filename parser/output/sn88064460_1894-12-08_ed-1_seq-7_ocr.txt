A man who did not know how to read c` and write, convicted of a slight of fense, was sentenced to imprisonment until he bad learned to read.

P After three weeks they were dis- i1 charged, as they had fulfilled their tl task to the full satisfaction of the fi magistrate. d Most Honorable Death. The most honorable death in China s is by strangulation, and high officials r condemned to death receive their sen- t tences from the emperor in the shape t of a silken cord with which they hang 1 themselves.
