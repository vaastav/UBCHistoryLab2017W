I'KOIfiniTIOX PROHIBITS. A Kansas Case Decided b,v tl»e I : ni teil States Supreme Court. A important decision made, and one like- j ly to be far reaching in its consequences, j in the U. S. Supreme Court, on Monday, * in the so-called Kansas prohibition cases, 1 of Mugler, vs. the State of Kansas, and the State of Kansas vs. Ziebold and others. The judgment of the court was pronounced in a long and elaborate opinion bv Justice Harlan. Justice Harlin concluded the decision sustaining the Kansas State prohibitory law as follows : "It is a fundamental prin ciple In our institutions, indispensable to the preservation of public liberty, that one of the separate departments of Govern ment shall not usurp the powers commit ted by the Constitution. As to the allega tion that prohibition of the manufacture and sale of liquor deprives liquor dealers of their property without due process of law, the court says al! property under our form of government is ieot to the obli gation that it shall not used so as to injuriously altect the rights of the com munity, rind thereby become u nuisance, lire State ot Kansas bad the right to pro hibit the liquor traffic. It did nut thereby takeaway the property of brewers. It simply abated a nuisance. The property is not taken away from its owners. They are only prohibited from using it lor the specific purposes which the Legislature de clared to be injurious to community. For reasons stated, says Justice Harlan, we are of opinion that Mugler plaintiff in error, has not been denied by judgments of the Supreme Court of Kansas any right, priv ilege or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United^ States, and its judgment in each case is accordingly af firmed. We are also of opinion that the Circuit Court of the United States erred in dismissing the bill ot the State in the suit against Ziebold and Hogelin, the de cree in that case is reversed and the cause remanded with the direction that it enter a decree granting to the State such relief as the act of March 7, 1S85, authorizes." GERMANY AND RUSSIA. Tlie Trouble with Kussiti not, Ended Yet. ! A Berlin dispatch says on the side of Russia the situation still continues grave. Tlte Czar ha« failed to gain control of the anti-Teutonie party, and if he himself is convinced of the friendly intentions of the German Government, he has been unable to persuade the majority in the Imperial Council, Some practical measures are nec essary to restore an entente. In the mean time the anti Germans parennial in the Ministry remains in power, and an order of De Geirs, instructing the press to cease at tacking Germany, is defied. The severest contest during the session of the Reichstag will be that over the hill making the legislative period five instead of three years. The bill is practically a j Government affair. The official organs j support the proposal strongly, on the ! ground that it will relieve the people of the j disturbing influences of often recurring j elections» while giving greater independ i ence to Parliament. There will be a fierce * and envenomed fight before the measure can pass, but it will pus- with a solid ma jority, equalling the septennate vote. No combination can defeat any bill having the support of the Government groups. The project to organize the Landwehr and j Landstrum is still before the Bimdcsratli, hut some of its provisions were made known. No official estimates h-.ve vet | been issued a- to what result the project I will have in strengthening the reserve, but i it is reported it will ir.erea-e the defensive force of the Empire by 400,000 men.
