Notice of $100,000 Legacy Follows Denver Man Around the World. A man at Denver. Col., named George F. MacCreary, assistant man ager of the St. James Hotel, has just received a letter that was mailed at Angola, Ind., Jan. 14, 1903. It follow ed him to different cities and towns in both hemispheres, and daring its travels actually went around the world, a little matter of 23,000 miles, ami covered, on the sidet separate and apart from the trip around the world, something like 27,500 miles, a total of 53,100 miles. The letter was from Charles May er, an attorney in Angola, and con tained the news that ten days before mailing Mr. MacCreary's uncle, George Franklin MacCreary, after whom he was named, had died, leav ing him sole hear to 620 acres of land in the most fertile part of Indi ana adjoining the village of Angola thret independent farmers tele phone lines, stock in the Dugdale Can company of Indianapolis, with a valuation of $10,000, and $11,000 in actual cash.- One hundred and forty dollars an acre is a most conservative estimate of land values in Steuben county, so that, giving the indepen dent telephone systems a valuation of $1,000 each, young Mr. MacCreary is considerably over $100,000 richer today than he was before his uncle's death. A few days ago young MacCreary received a note from Attorney May er,, who is now practicing in St. Jo seph, Mo., telling him that by prov ing his identity he may come into his fortune at any time. Mr. Mayer also asked Mr. MacCreary to meet him in St. Joseph, and both will go from there to Indiana. The saying that truth is stranger than fiction was never more conclu sively proved than in the relation of Mr. MacCreary's experiences since July 18, 1838, when, a lad of 10, he ran away from Angola, going to In dianapolis with the intention to sec and join Barnum's circus. But freights are slow and seldom onitime, so the boy concluded to come West and reduce the Indian supply. A mis understanding of information given him by a switchman in the Pennsyl vania Railroad yards in the Hoosier capital put him on a stock train for Philadelphia instead of a train for St. Louis and the Wet. To facilitate his riding the conductor put his name on rone of the stock bills as "man in charge.' The destination of this par ticular consignment happened to be Liverpool, which explains how young MacCreary made his first trip across the Atlantic. Rolling' stones not only do not gather moss, but as well they do not write letters and not until his arrival in San Francisco thjee years ago, after four years of deep sea travel as an American blue jacket, did the runaway communicate with his .par ents, who are now in Albert Lea, Minn. He celebrated the event by going to sea, spending the next two years before the mast, and, remem bering now to mail his parents a not; or souvenir postal card from nearly every port he touched. This explains how the globe-trojtting letter follow ed him to Frisco, Liverpool, New York, Wellington, New Zealand; Ho bart, in Tasmania; Biseria, Algeria; Boo Azar, Morocco; Accra and Lib reville, on the slave coast of Africa: Mahanora, Madagascar; Sofia. Portu guese East Africa; Port Jackson Australia; Succadana. Bornoe; Ben coolen, Sumatra; Takanabe, Japan, and scores of other ports. As the Chinese See Us. The following from a paper pub lished in India gives this description of . American customs by a Chinese gentleman: "You cannot civilize these foreign devils. They are beyond redemption They will live for weeks and months without touching a mouthfr.l of rice, but they eat the flesh of bullocks anj sheep in enormous quantities. That is why they smell so badly; the smell like sheep themselves. Every day they - take a bath to rid them selves of their disargeeable odors, but they do not succeed. Nor do they cat their meat cooked in small pieces .It is carried into the room in large chunks, often half raw, and they cut and slash and tear.it apart. They eat whh knives and prongs It makes a civilized being perfectly nervous. One fancies himself in the presence of sword swallowers. They even sit at the same tablt with wom en, and the latter are served first, reversing the order of nature. Yet These American women are to be pit ied too. On festive occasions they are dragged around the room to the accon -oaniment of the most hellish music. India Witness. Hanged to Satisfy Hegroes. At A!xandria, Louisiana, last Fri day, Thomas C. Braden, a white man 55 years of age, was legally hanged for an assault upon Miss Laura War ren at Lecompte, La., on September 15 last Braden formerly resided in Indiana and was a paroled prisoner from tne Illinois penitentiary. Braden recently wrote to relative in Ter.e Haute. Ind., claiming he was to be sacrificed to show the negroes that the hanging of blacks was not due to racial feeling. He admitted he was guilty of the crime, but declared many Southern ers also were and that he was forced to pay his life because he was a stranger. ROOT BEHIND PROCEEDINGS. Secretary of State Inspired Judicial Inquiry Into Japanese Matter. The fact that the entire question of the exclusion of Japanese students from the regular schools in San Fran cisco is to be settled in the courts is due to Secretary of State Root, who saw in this method a means to clear up the problem which has developed into many complex phases. The secretary expressed the opinion that it would be the only way of effectu ally disposing of the controversy be tween the .state and federal author ities ". That the president's views on the subject meet with the hearty approv al of the Japanese government was made evident when Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassador, said that he had personally thanked the pres ident for what he had said. A rumor that a new treatv between the United States and Japan was to be negotiated, designed to remedy any defects in one now in force, was set at rest Wednesday when both Viscount Aoki and Secretary Root unequivocally denied that 'such a thing even was in contemplation. The California delegation in con gress has received what it considers satisfactory assurat ce that the pres ident did not desire to be understood as saying in the Japanese section of his message that he would use the military force of the United States in forcing Japanese into the California schools in which whit children are taught , k A is said to have been his purpose to coney the idea that he would use the military to protect Japanese against mob violence. Californians take no offense at this interpretation of the message and agree that the chief executive should do everything in his power to protect Japanese as well as all otter foreigners against violence. "This whole San Francisco affair is proving to be a tempest in a tea pot," Representative Julius Kahn said Wednesday: "It will die out as soon as there is a general under standing as to iwhy California takes the position it does. "The courts and not the public must settle all the legal questions in volved in the San Francisco school situation. We are glad to know thai the administration is taking steps to institute action which will give the courts a chance to pass on the valid ity of the San Francisco school board's . action. The Japanese question -was practi cally the oaly topic-- discussed - by members of the house Wednesday and strong opposition to the presi dent's policy is manifest. Senators are avoiding discussion because they do not deem it wise to aggravate a situation which they know to be ex tremely critical. Several senators who called on the president were in formed that the real cause of trouble lies in the wording of the ordinance or law of San Francisco under which Mongolians are excluded from the public schools of that city. It appears that the law reads in ef fect that "persons afflicted rith con tagious diseases, Mongolians, etc, must attend separate schools. The Japanese government objects to the wording of the law more than to the segregation of Japanese in such schools. The president is very confident that when the California authorities un derstand, the cause Of tne Japanese protest the law will be amended so a to give no particular offense to the Japanese government. Senators are of the same opinion. All of the facts will be brought out clearly and comprehensively in the procedings which are to be insti tuted in 'the federal courts of Cali fornia by the department of justice for the purpose of testing the right of the federal government to enforce ment of its treaty obligations. Two Cent Fares. The legislature will without doubt take up the question of two-cent fares on railroads, says the Elkhart Review.' It seems not at all unlikely from the temper manifested by the people that laws will be passed fix ing a two-cent rate per mile for pas senger travel. While this may be in conformity with the general desire, the general assembly should act on its best judgment as to whether all railroads should be included in the operation of the law. It seems to a common man that there should be some discrimination. Trunk lines perhaps are able to bear it, but there may be some short lines of railroad wthin the sUte that could not stand such a rate arid live. The railroad commission has found that there are some lines in Indiana that do not aggregate $3,000 net per mile, the minimum amount recognized by the law of Michigan in fixing its basis of a two-cent rate. Indiana certainly should not discount Michigan in the matter, for there has been in many quarters a feeling that ur neighbor ing state was oppressive rather than just in some of its railroad legisla tion. Railroad "Accidents. Do the public realize the enormous number of persons killed annually in railroad accidents In the United States? Do they know that in the careless, happy-go-lucky manner in which our railroads are operated 9,703 persons lost, their lives and 85, 008 were injured during the last fis cal year? This is not guess work. Those r.re official figures. THE MAN IN THE 

MOON Is Composed of the Moon's Moun tains and Depressions. The first of a series of six lectures to be given by Prof. Moulton, of Chi cago University, was given at the Washington school auditorium Fri day evening, on "Our Nearest Neigh bor The Moon," and notwithstand ing that the evening was disagree able and the walking bad, there was a large attendance. ' Prof. Moulton is an entertaining speaker and presents astronomical facts in a way that does not tire his audience. His lecture was interesting and instructive from start to finish. He opened with an illustration showing how the distance to the moon was measured and how easy it is to calculate these distances, the same method being used as is used in measuring the distance across a stream. By illustrations he showed the earth to be 8,000 miles in diam eter and the moon 2,160 miles in di ameter. The distance of the moon from the earth is 240,000 miles and it would require the sounds of a dis turbance in the moon fourteen days and nights, traveling at the rate of a mile every five seconds, to reach us. And it : would be possible for sound to reach us from the moon were the atmospheric conditions the same all the way, but instead the atmosphere reaches only about 100 miles about the earth. , The . saying of a dry and a wet moon, etc., terms of weather prog nostications frequently used, especi ally by the older people, are, accord ing to the lecturer, mere guesswork, as the conditions are about the same year. in and year out, differing only as the moon varies in its orbit, which is very slight, and the difference in its shape is the result of the sun rays and its' revolutions. The, moon is uninhabited, or at least if it is inhabited the people there live without moisture or atmosphere. According to the judgment of astron omers, backed by the results of pho tography as procured through the best instruments that human ingenu ity can devise, there is neither mois ture nor atmosphere on the moon, and in fact it, in great part, consists of great mountains so high that the highest mountains on this earth arc mere hills in comparison. There .are great craters, miles in width, the ex act space being easily computed by the measurements by which the di ameter of the moon was secured These are named and are known to astronomers as readily as are the Rockies and Pike's Peak to. the gen eral public. The reason for the moon being so rough is because there is no mois ture to level it down. According to his theory the earth was at one time equally as rough as the moon. Its roughness consisted of great moun tains and craters, like the moon of today, but there was moisture, and the rain descending for the many, many years melted the rocks and washed them down into the valleys, beating down the peaks and leveling the country into the great plains of today as we see them. Pictures were shown in which these mountains were plainly set out and the moon shown in its different quarter and when full. The pictures were good and the lecture one of the most interesting that has been given in Plymouth. In addition to the astronomy pict ures there were shown pictures of the great Ycrkes telescope at Lake Geneva, Wis., and also of the Lick telescope in California. The lecturer explained how these great Instru ments are easily handled' and can be so focused that any particular spot on the moon, or any of t!ie planets can be minutely examined. It was a great lecture and the five that are to follow it will, no doubt, be well at tended. The Japanese Question. Representative Jenkins of Wiscon sin, chairman of the House commit tee on judiciary, said Wednesday: "Primarily, it might be said the en tire school question is under the ab solute control of the state by virtue of the police power, unless interfered with by the treaty making power. Unquestionably a treaty can be made covering and including the question, but it is not for me to say whether the treaty does or does mot cover and include it. That is for the adminis tration to determine until the courts decide. "There is no ßense of justification in talking war. It is worse than silly. "If the question is not covered by treaty Japan has no cause for com plaint, for in a case of this kind, if not covered by treaty, the nation con not be held responsible for the aclbn of the state, acting witnin its sover eign power. If the question is cover ed by treaty this natron must abide by treaty stipulations or violate them at the risk of war." Rockefeller is Subpenaed, Jo'm D. Rockefeller and his six associates, who control the Siandard Oil company, have been served with subpeneas to appear before the Unit el States circuit court in St. Louis on Monday, January 7th next. Be sides Mr. Rockefeller, subpenea were served on Henry H. Rogers, Henry M. Flagler, Charles M. Pratt, Oliver H. Payne, William Rockefel ler and John D. Archbold. These men are named in the federal govern ment's charge with being leaders in the Standard Oil company. E. SHIRAR'S SUDDEN DEATH. He Dies Instantly While Digging Mrs. Hannah Riley's Grave. The Tribune Friday evening gave a short notice of the death of Eman uel Shirar but had no particulars. Mr. Shirar and Sylvester Lovell went to the Jacoby cemetery at the Jacoby church Friday. The grave was almost finished and both men were in it fixing some boards to keep it from caving, when Mr. Shirar suddenly straightened himself up and without uttering a word dropped dead. Mr. Lovell thought ne had fainted and used every effort possible to re store him to consciousness, but find ing he was dead assistance was sum moned. Undertaker Bunnell was sent for and brought the remains to Mr. Shirar's home in this citv. Deceased was born in Carroll coun ty, Ind., and had lived in this state most of his life. He came to this county eighteen years ago and had lived in this city and vicinity since then. He was the sexton of Oak Hill cemetery at the time of his death and was conceded the best man for the position ever employed there. His ae was 52 years, 10 months and 2 days. He was honest, industrious, tem perate and in every respect a model citizen. His death cast a gloom over the entire city and the family have the sympathy of everybody in Ply mouth. He leaves a wife, four sons and one daughter. The daughter, Lil lian, is the oldest child, she is twenty one. The youngest is a son, six years old. He leaves also a sister and a brother in Dakota, and a sister at Rushville, Ind.

There are certain old, old stories that are ever new and that never lose their charm for human beings, and chief among these is the love of the sexes, varied wth inconstancy, be trayal and death. Other stories hav only local interest, bi:t a love story in one end of this country excites ä profound interest all the way to the other end. On this principle the trial of Gil lette in Herkimer, N. for the murder of the poor girl whom he had ruined under promise of marriage has been followed in comrnunitits thous ands of miles away and produced deep impressions in regard to Gil lette's guilt or innocence. People who form their opinio.i from the mere -smattering of the evi dence which has appeared in the press reports would not, of course, affect the verdict if they could, but they can not help entertaining these opinions, particularly if now they find them confirmed by the verdict of the jury. The impression is almost universal that Gillette is guilty. Bad arguments are always dangerous, and the verdict of the jury must have been largely due vto the absurdities of the defense. The claim that the poor girl was drowned is absurd because her Kings contained no water and because Gil lette could have saved her from drowning. The claim that her skull was fractured by striking her head against the bottom of the boat when she rose after sinking Was absurd be cause bodjes rise through the water with little or no force. The jury saw, too, that this was a typical cse. A comparative anato mist can from a singje fossil bone reconstruct the whole skeleton of the animal to which it belonged, and the same is true of some crimes. Given a man who ruins a woman under promise of marriage and co habits with her until he js tired of her and wishes to escape from her and then her sudden death while in his company, and everybody knows the rest. The inference is safe and irresistible that he murdered her. In such cases there is never any hazard in Inflicting the death penalty because the man ought to be execut ed on . general principles. Gillette richly deserves the electric chair whether he murdered Grace Brown or not. If he had murdered her In the first place instead of disgracing her he would have been a tetter man Chicago Chronicle. Facts and Lies. The Chicago Record-Herald de clares that there are some lies that have a glanour of truth that it se?ms impossible t oput an end to their cir culation. Probably for years to come we shall hear from all parts of the country that in Chicago in November 1906, a negro judge was dishonestly 'counted out" by the election com missioners, and this degpite the fact that the commissioners did merely clerical work, under the eye of the candidate's attorney, and that this attorney himself, over his own sig nature, pointed out the impossibility of fraud In the counting. Another such lie is the statement that President Roosevelt denied, prior to the election two years ago, that corporation money had been contributed to the Republican cam paign fund, although by reference to the documents in the - case any one can see that the President admitted the contributions and denied only tha threats or promises went with them. 

FORTUNE TELLERS.' They Grow Rich From Silly People's Superstitions. The advertising columns of an In dianapolis newspaper recently con tained the names and addresses of fifteen clairvoyants and "fortune tell ers," all of whom.by their own state- ments are able not only to reveal the past, but foretell the future, tell how to regain health, how to succeed in business, etc. Each claimed to be the greatest priestess of occult science and physic force the world has ever known. How these pretenders in this the twentieth century, and in a coun try where for forty years, the public school has flourished, and among other things, it is to be presumed has taught common sens, can find pat rons by the score is indeed strange. It wou'.d require but little thought on, the part of these who patronize clairvoyants and "fortune tellers" to convince them that the future can not le foretold by any one and that mon ey spent in the effort for information in this direction will bring no bet ter results than if thrown at the wind. If these priestesses of occult and psychic force are able to read the futuTe with any degree of accur acy a six months' stay on the Chi cago Board of Trade would make them millionaires. If you can tell an other how best to succeed in busi ness, restore lost lovers to loVe-sick maidens, and cause bad. husbands to become good, why waste valuable time 'reading the future for silly women at $1 a sitting. History of Smallpox. Few diseases have been so destruc tive of human life as smallpox, and it has ever been regarded with hor ror alike from its fatality, its loath someness, its disfiguring effects, and the fact that no age or condition is exempt from its attacks. It is both contagious and infectious; that is, it is communicated from the presence of the patient and is also carried in clothing or other articles that have been exposed to its effluvia. There is evidence that it is communicable from the beginning of the attack, though its contagion is more virulent after the eruption begins. A mill form in one patient may cause a se vere case in the person contracting the disease from him. The virus maintains its vitality for years. ; Smallpox is a tropical disease.' As the cholera can be traced to its origin in India and the grip to the river valleys of China, so the habitat of smallpox seems to be the jungles of Africa. The vJUeas was often brought to the United States with cargoes of slaves, and one of the risks of the slave trader was the loss of his merchandise enroute from smallpox. The earliest historical mention of smallpox is in the Sixth century, when it was raging in Arabia and Egypt and penetrated to Southern Europe. That a person exposed to small pox, though himself immune, ,may convey the disease to another through infection carried in his hair or clothing, and that a mild case may produce a virulent one have been demonstrated by many examples, as has also the fact that the infection may remain dormant for years and still set in its deadly work. To il lustrate: A farm hand died in Central New York of smallpox. His clothes were all burned except an overcoat, which he had not worn after the attack and which had been removed from the room and thoroughly aired as soon as the disease was recognized. It was, moreover, hung away in an airy loft; but ten years later the thrifty farmer's wife cut it into carpet rags caught the infection and died of the disease. A lady over eighty years of age, on the way to visit her son, was in a car when a case of smallpox was discovered. She had been vaccinated in childhood and, assuming she was immune, had her clothing disinfected and made her visit. While at the son'. residence she had a slight chill and fever with a scarcely perceptible eruption, was not sick enough to call a doctor or even s'tay In bed. Her son was her principal attendant. Thi son, within two weeks, had a vlruient attack of smallpox and died, as did his son and ten out of twelve neigh bors who contracted the disease. A physician having a smallpox patient, though lie carefully aired but did no disinfect his clothing, conveyed the disease to his little child with fatal results. Smallpox hs been called a cold weather disease, because It usually rages worse In winter. It has also been termed a filth disease, because it breeds more read'dy In crowded, un sanitary quarters. Undoubtedly the closer confinement and lack of ven tilation make the disease worae in winter, and cleanliness is a prophy lactic for any disease especially of contagious or infective character. But smallpox-utilizes all seasons and is no respector of rank or wealth. No Reason for Getting Hot. And so the Californians, and es peclally those at San Francisco, are said to be at fever heat over the president's emphatic declaration, in his message to congress, that th treaty rights of the Japanese within our borders shall be duly respected. They will probably cool off after calmly thinking the matter over. There really seem to be no occasion for getting hot ovr'a matter like that. South Bend Times. 

PRESIDENT DENIES REPORT, Says New Treaty With Japan Is Not Contemplated. i icsmcni Kooseveu nas issued r :j i . through Assistant Secretary of State Bacon an authorized denial of the current reports that a new Japanese treaty is or had been about to bene- ! gotiated. These reports gained wide J circulation in view of Senat kins remarks a day or two ago to the effect that public sentiment would eventually force the negotiation of a treaty. Senator Cullom denied that there was anything in the talk about a new treaty. Other emphatic denials were made by Secretary Root, Assistant Secretary of State Adee and Viscount Aoki, the Japanese ambassador. Final steps were taken Friday for the settlement of the entire Japanese j question in the courts. City Attorney William G. Burke, acting for the San Francisco school board, submitted to United States District Attorney Dev lin a statement of facts bearing on the school controversy, which will be made the basis of action to test the validity of the law under which the board acted. ine statement as submitted was telegraphed to Washington for re view by the department of justice be fore the 'matter is taken into court The statement recites the fact of the passage of the ordinance by the school board ordering all Japanese and Koreans to attend the oriental public school in the Chinese quarter It says that this action was based on a. state law, which is quoted, and that no attempt was made to deprive the Japanese of any of the advantages granted children of other nations but that in all respects this oriental school was equal to the other schools of the city. , It says that the points of law to be settled are whether the order of the school board and the state law on which it was based are in violation of the treaty with Japan; whether child ren of Japanese and Korean parent age are denied any rights by this or der and lawt and whether the treaty with Japan so far 'as it relates to this question is valid. It is claimed that the so-called or iental school is inferior in building, equipment and staff to other schools of the city and that the facilities af- forded for the education of the child ren of the orientals are inadequate. This is one of the matters of fact that will need to be amended accord ing to the views of the Japanese con sular authorities. Btfore the earthquake and until the president agitation the Oriental was called the Chinese school. It was lo cated in the heart of Chinatown and the attendance was about 120. After the fire a small shack was built on the same site and the present attend ance is about twenty, but there is not a single Japanese among the pupils. Not more than five Japanese have at tended any one of the schools of the city. The Case of Bailey. To one who recalls Senator Bail ey's virtuous indignation over the President's attitude on railway rate legislation last spring it will come as an unpleasant shock to read his feeb le defense of his financial dealings with the Standard Oil Company's dummy branch, the Waters-Pierce Company. Labored as is Bailey's at tempt to make It out that his deal ings were strictly proper, one cannot help feeling that his labor is all in vain and that his own words convict him. , " . " A few months ago he gave out a ringing defense of the right of a law yer member of Congress to practice his profession and earn thereby his daily bread. Now we find him driven to a corner by the documents m the possession of Attorney General Dav idson and denying that he would do so dishonorable a thing as to accept a retainer from the Waters-Pierce company in its dealings with the State of Texas. That is a painful inconsistency. But it is not the worst. The books and documents show that many thousands f dollars passed into Senator Bail ey's hands from the treasury of the company just at this period when he was offering it his services. Some of the money, he tells us, he borrowed and paid buck. Since the books do not show that he repaid these loans, he is reduced to the suggestion that probably the employe of the company to whom he repaid the money stole it and never gave him the proper credit. As for other moneys the books of the company show he re ceived, he says that if he ever receiv ed such sums it was not for work done for the oil company but for work for H. Clay Pierce personally. Senator Bailey has been indorsed by his party for re-election to the Senate, but it is scarcely conceivable that the legislature will retain him in public life after such a showing as this. Record Herald. Award Big Ditch Contract. Ananias Ipe, of Nappanee, was awarded the contract for the dredge work on the David Hygema ditch. His bid was for 5.98 cents per cubic yard, which will make the total cost of the dredge work about $11,000. The ditch will start at the county line of Elkhart and St. Joseph counties, extend through the latter county in to Marshall county, where it will ter minate at the Yellow river. It will be 9 1-2 mlies in length and will drain 20,000 acres. ' j OUR 

MERCHANT MARINE. Indiana Delegation. Will Present a Modified Bill. A conference of. Indiana Republi can members of congress was held last Thursday to consider the ship subsidy bill. The conference was at tended by all of the Republican mem bers from Indiana except Represen tative Elias S. Holliday. Those pres ent were Representatives Watson. Foster, Chaney, Brick, Cromer, Fred Landis, Charles B. Landis, Crum packer, Overstrect and Gilhams. Mr. Watson presided. All phases of the ship-subsidy question were discussed and the Hoosier congressman were in substantial accord in their views during the conference. They unan imously chose Mr. Watson as their spokesman and instructed him to say to the press representatives that they were a unit in opposition to the pres ent ship-subsidy bill that is pending before the House Commhee on Mer chant Marine and Fisheries and in their belief that it can not possibly pass the House. This was the only formal, an nouncement that was made, but the informal pre'eeedngs of the confer ence were of more significance than the formal action. The trend of sen timent among the Indiana Republican members, as developed at the con ference,' was in favor of a modified bill that will build up trade between the United States and the South American countries and between the United States and the Orient. Repre sentative Crumpacker submitted plan which he had blocked out on paper. It contains provisions authorizing the Government to contract on the best terms for regular mail service between the principal ports of the United States and the principal ports of South America, fixing a maximum cost of carrying the mails. It also provides for a similar service on not to exceed two lines to the Orient, It arranges for the voluntary enlist ment of the crews of, the several boats into the navy and specifies that those who volunteer for naval service shall be paid the scale of retainers mentioned in the pending bill as it passed the Senate. The subsidfzed boats are tq be subject to impress ment as auxiliaries to the navy in times of war. In explaining his plan. Judge Crumpacker said that it is just such a bill as was advocated by Benjamin Harrison in one of his messages to congress. He declared that it would serve to bring the United States into closer political and commercial rela tions with the South American coun tries, and that the difference between it and the pending measure is that it eliminates all bomises and bounties as well as all subsidies to "Morganii- ed" interests which are already mak nig large profits. What he advocated, he said, is not a subsidy, but is simply adequate compensation for carrying of the mails which, of course, means also the carrying of passengers and ex press and possibly some high-class freight, will develop avenues of trade, and that tramp steamers will follow in the wake of the- mail boats and soon there wilt be regular and exten sive intercourse between the United States and the countries to the south ward. He pointed to the fact that pas sengers and mail from the United States xo South American countries go first to Liverpool and thence to South America, and said that such a condition should not be. Cattle too Big to Sell Well. What is said to the heaviest car load of cattle ever seen in the Indi anapolis yards was offered Wednes day, says the Indianapolis Star. There were ten head in the consign ment and the average weight was 1, 861 pounds. These shorthorn steers belonged to F. M. Bilby, a Rush county farmer. Three.of the, number weighed over 2,400 pounds each. The really big fellow weighed 2,680 pounds. This specimen is six feet tall and measures thirty-eight inches across the back. Bidding on these cattle was very slow. The buyers stood around and marveled at their size, declaring that they were too big for their trade. Finally the whole ot was disposed of to the United Dressed Beef company of New York at $5.75 per hundred pounds: Some of them were six years old. Should Be Severely Punished. There are indications that the rail roads are systematically attempting to evade the anti-rebate law by de- iberately failing to furnish cars alike to all shippers. Charges of this kind have been made and the inter-state commerce commission is now inves tigating them. The Indiana railroad commission has found so many idle cars in this state that it suspects a definite purpose on the part bf the railroads to embarrass certain ship pers and injure certain communities or the advantage of others. Action of this kind should be severely pun- shed. Red .Man's Signature. Indian chiefs, treating with the governmeit now have to append their thumb-prints to the documents, in stead of cross-marks, as hitherto. The reason is that chiefs have fre quently repudiated the cross-marks and the obligations involved. The first document has just been signed by thumb-print. It was a treaty be tween the government and the Uma tilla Indians, of Washington, to al low cattle to cross the Indian reser vation unharmed. 

ELECTION OF SENATORS. Convention at Des Moines Appeals to the Country. A determined campaign to force Congress to call a constitutional con-' vention was launched Thursday by the interstate senatorial amendment conference. The movement for the popular election of United States sen ators now is well under way, and the fight will be carried on in evtry part of the country. The convention made known its attitude in a manner which left no doubt that the delegates were con vinced the support of the Senate could not be enlisted. The resolu tbns adopted say that while, in the opinion of the delegates, there is a well-grounded demand for the popu lar election of senators the Senate has refused persistently to assent to the proposition to submit the matter to the states to pa-;s upon. Little hope is seen of any change of heart on the part of the upper branch of Congress, and the conven tion accordingly adopted the alterna tive of carrying the battle into each statet in the attempt to induce the re quired proportion of spates to join in a call for a constitutional convention. That the latter course is less pref erable and not altogether without its dangers is recognized by the con ference. If Congress should submit the proposition to the states no other change to the Constitution could be considered. Once a constitutional convention is called, however, the delegates hold, thero is no telling what efforts might be made to tinker with the Constitution, as the conven tion would have it in its power to make other changes. Thomas A. Cheshire of Des Moines Iowa, was named chairman of an ex ecutive committee of five to Uke charge of the movement. His asso ciates are Thomas J. Kernan of Lou isiana, Frank C.

The work of the committee and the new orgnization will be directed to ward securing from the thirt -seven state legislatures that meet this win ter demands upon congress for a con stitutional convention to which the conference unanimously, commuted itself. The organization chose for it self the name of "the interstate sena torial convention," and Congressman Strode of N bntska is its first presi dent. Ceck to Protect Dxsa. "The next General Assembly," says E. E. - Earle, deputy State fish and game commissioner, "will be ask ed to enact some legislation looking to the further protection of bass in the iikes acd streams of northern Indiana. Under the present game law the closed season for hook and line fishing in northern Indiana ends on the 15th day of May of each year. Recently this department has been receiving many letters from fisher men, in the northern part of the state, recommending that the closed season be extended thirty days, or from May 15 to June 15. The fishermen say that the bass in the laeks are not off their beds by May 15 and when, at the end of the closed season, the fishermen rush to the lakes the T)ig ones are caught and the eggs are not hatched. As a result the number of bass in the lakes is gradually being reduced. Mr; Eark says that he will take no action himself in xecomnending such legislation, for it' is understood that representatives- from some of the northern counties where the lakes are situated will be asked by their constituents to introduce a bill of this kind Banians Bill Passed. The house has passed, the bill per mitting national banking associations to make loans on, real estate as secur ity and limiting the amount of such loan. The vote was 111 to 51. The bankers in the hou.:e urged the pas sage of the bill, uvhile the opponents of the measure insisted that real es tate was not a proper security for na tional banks. They contended that the system had proved a failure wherever tried. The banking bill has been one of the west's favorite measures and the leaders in the house from that sec tion lined up generally in favor of the legislation, which, it was asserted, would go far toward popularizing the national banks. Fifteen Thousand Deer Shot. Statistics just compiled show that during the hunting season of 190G ,400 carcasses of deer were ship-ped to lower Michigan by way of the Sarahs of Mackinac. In addition 2, 500 were transported by express to upper peninsula points, and hundreds of others were shipped out cf the dis trict over the Chicago line. This is a total of more than 9,000 deer, but does net sum up the full slaughter. Several thousand carcasses were tak en into northern Michigan towns by team. The total kill was probably not less than 15,000. Lost Both Hands. Miss Cora Selby of Columbia City married Walter B runn of BluiTton at Fort Wayne, after he had lost both hands in an accident.
