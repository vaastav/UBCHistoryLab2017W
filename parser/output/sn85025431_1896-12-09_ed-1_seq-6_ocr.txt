PRESIDENTIAL VIEW MUCH OP MR. CLEVELAND'S ME8* SAGE pEVOTED TO CUBA. Spain's Inability to End the Contest Will Be the Signal For Aetlon—When That Time Arrives tho Method of Procedure May Be Plain—Country Congratulated on the Result of the Election. "WASHINGTON, Deo. 7.—Both house* of congress assembled at noon. Almost immediately the president's message was read. It proved to be a very vol uminous document, about 17,000 words. The opening sentences refer to the late election. "As representatives of the people in the legislative branch of their govern ment," the president says, "you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating ag gressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suf frage, without disturbance to our tran quility or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. "When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have suc ceeded a heated clash of political opin ions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic dis position which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serius apprecia tion of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites." The Cuban Question. The most interesting as well as most important portion of the message is that which deals with foreign affairs. The Venezuelan boundary question, the president says, has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States. The insurrection in Cuba, however, still continues, with all its perplexities. It is difficult to per ceive that any progress has thus far been made towards the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the sea ports and all the considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland coun try. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, character and resource, and are none the less in flexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the object for which they took up arms. Mean time the country is being ruined indus trially and commercially. Spain, the president says, should grant real auton omy which, he believes would be satis factory to the majority of the insur gents. In concluding the subject he says A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the con gress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests as well as a regard for the interests of nations and their citizens joined by considerations of humanity and a de sire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our government to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved, and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace. In regard to the Union and Central Pacific railroad defaults the president says that unless something is done prior to Jan. 1, he deems it to the best inter est of the country to begin foreclosure proceedings. The retirement of greenbacks is again urged because of the danger to the gold reserve. "v The various departmental reports are given brief mention and recommenda tion. Civil service is commended' and the good work of the interstate com merce commission noticed. The message closes with an appeal for economy in expenditure. E8TI

OLNEY IN CUBA. Supplementary Report to Congress by the Secretary of State. WASHINGTON, Deo. 8.—For the first time within the memory tit old officials, the secretary of state has made a regu lar report to the president, for trans mission to congress, like the reports of other officers bf the cabinet. This re port was laid before congress as an ap pendix to the president's message. It treats of many details of our relations during the past year with foreign gov ernments that either were not touohed upon in the message or were more briefly treated. Under the head of Spain, Secretary Olney has much to say in regard to Cuba, and in his report h& sets out in great detail the history of the growth of the rebellion, the present evil state of affairs on the island and other facts upon which the president bases his broad statements and conclusion. No reference is made to a report from Con sul General Lee, but the secretary in timates that this information comes principally from the United States con suls, and so must be regarded as con fidential as to its source. The secre tary's estimate of the present situation, is disclosed in the following paragraph, made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the industrial re sources of Cuba: "From whatever point of view we regard the matter, it is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at our doors alike dangerous to good re lations, destructive of legitimate com merce, fatal to the internal resources of Cuba, and most vexatious and trying because entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its domestic ad ministration, and in its outward rela tions. This situation cannot indefin itely continue without growing still worse, and the time may not be far dis tant when the United States must se riously consider whether its rights and interests, as well as its international duties in view of its peculiar relations to the island do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." 

INVITED THE BOLTERS. Republican Silver Senators May Attend the Party Caucus. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—When the de termination was reached to hold a Re publican caucus an interesting situa tion at once presented itself. The sil ver Republican senators who bolted the St. Louis platform and ticket were an unknown quantity in their political affiliations, and whether or not to in vite them to attend the Republican caucus was an undecided matter. Many conferences were held. Senator Chandler of New Hampshire was par ticularly active in recommending that the bolters be notified of the caucus, which is practically an invitation to at tend. Senator Chandler took the posi tion that the votes of these men would be needed in passing a tariff bill. Sen ator Quay, it is understood, took the same view. It was finally concluded that notices should be sent them as be fore. This result Placed the Burden of Action on the silver Republicans. They con ferred until late to settle upon a line of policy. Senator Dubois of Idaho is, or was, secretary of the caucus. He will resign this place, as he has been more active than many of the others in the recent campaign and was one of the most urgent in advocacy of a bolt at St. Louis. There has been a ten dency among sogae Republicans to pursue a conciliatory course toward the silver Republicans and especially as a number of them have declared in favor-of protection, and Senator Man tle's paper has been quite positive in this direction. It is not believed that either Senator Pettigrew, Senator Man tle or Senator Cannon will attend the caucus, although they would not be re quired to indicate their views. The purpose of the caucus is to outline programme for the session. Pension Bill Reported. WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The first appro priation bill of the session has been finished by tho house committee on appropriations, and reported to the house, so that it may be passed this week. It is the pension bill, which carries a total of $14.1,263,680,a decrease of about $65,000 from the estimates of the commissioner of pensions. STRIKE IS SPREADING. Quay Laborers, Engineers and Bargemen Out at Hamburg. HAMBURG, Dec. 5.—At a meeting of the central strike committee here, it was decided to declare a general strike and a pamphlet was issued calling upon all quay laborers, engineers, bargemen, lumpers and car men to quit work in order to bring the business of the port to a complete standstill.

WEYLEB HEMMED IN CAID TO BE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS. Maceo's Ariny on Either Side and Forces Have Daily Skirmishes—Movement on Foot to Capture Weyler If He Attempts to Escape. JACKSONVILLE, Fl&J Deo. 7.—A spe cial to The Citizen ^from Key West says: The steamer Whfjsney brought Havana news in relation to Maoeo and Weyler. Passengers state that Weyler himself is now encamped within 10 miles from Artemisa and his army is scattered along the trocha and through Pinar del Rio district. When Maceo retreated from Weyler in his first campaign his plan was to surprise Weyler at the first opportun ity, and how Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler, and they are having daily skirmishes. Weyler is Completely Hemmed in, and if he shall attempt to move he will be compelled to go to Artemisa. Small bands have crossed the trocha into Havana district and are attacking the outposts and villages of that province. Insurgents numbering 7,000 are en camped in Havana province, 20 miles from Havana, and will go to Maceo's assistance when needed. Spies in Havana are keeping the insurgents posted as to the movements of the Spanish posts. A movement is on foot to capture Weyler if he shall attempt to go to-Havana by rail. Firemen and volunteers in Havana are Being Sent to Weyler1* Relief. Heretofore these troops were used in the defense of the city. Since Tuesday's raid on Guanabacoa the city has been attacked almost every night and Thursday night 250 Cuban cavalry rode for two hours through the city. The damage done amounts to 86 houses burned and a large quantity of supplies and ammu nition seized also a large number of mules loaded and ready to leave the city were taken. HAVANA IS EXCITED. Insurgents Very Industrious' In the Vicin ity of That City. JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 7.—The day's Havana advices report an excit ed conflict of opinion there as to whether the forcing of the trocha by the Cubans Saturday was by guerilla bands or by the vanguard of Maceo's army in a movement to unite with Go mez. Spaniards have given no definite news from the front for a week, and at the same time have redoubled their censorship of the press. Sharp firing has been heard again in Havana from the neighborhood of Guanabacos and other suburbs of that section, and all Havana is excited over the occurrence. Over 500 refugees have passed into the city during the past five days from that section, fearing for their lives dur ing the fights between the soldiers and the insurgents. Nearly all the Havana volunteers have gone to the front, but as fast as they rout the guerrillas in one place they encounter them in another, mak ing a succession of running fights, all within 5 or 10 miles of the city. About 100 soldiers have been killed or wound ed so far in these engagements. Probably Only a Wish.
