_srBF*T)ERICK8BTJBQ, YA._ THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10,1908. ??-- ??? ? ? THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE The President's message to the Congress contains nothing new or striking. In brief it is practically a wpetition of what he has heretofore recomniended. He refers to the usual ?objects touched upon In such docu? ments, in his usual style. The only fftAtures of hla message worthy of special comment are bis reference to railroad control by the natianaj government, and his fling at the Democratic attitude on injunctlous aftVting labor organixatione. In reference to the first proposition Mr. Roosevelt would direst the state? of ail control over railroads doing an Interstate business, and in this con? nection he says: "The opposition to government control of these great corporations makes Its most effec? tive effort in the shape of an ap? peal to the old doctrine of States' rights. The proposal to make the national government supreme over, prefore to give it complete \over, the railroad? is merely rt*aJ to carry out to the letter e prime purposes, if not the rpoae.for which the conntitu onnded.Itdoes not represent Mr. Roosevelt hoe iposed to States' rights his reference to the -c==2ftof States' rights" is no ,t if he imagine? that the f t Cots doctrine is so old that loot, he is woefully ia\e states are never going - any of their rights at ?f anyone.
