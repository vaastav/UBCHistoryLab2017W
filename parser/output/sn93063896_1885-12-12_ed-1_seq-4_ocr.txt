PECULIAR AILMENT. Eighteen Gallons of a Milky Fluid Drhwn From a Man's Stomach. Chicago, December 4. Dr. James M. Hutchinson, one of the surgeons of the Cook County Hospital, last Tuesday pen formed a peculiar surgical operation, which he thus describes: "A young man of thirty- live years was taken to his mother's home sick In a peculiar way. I was called to see him. He had led the rapid life of a bache lor who seldom goes borne, and ne bad a fat, pouchy stomach on him. 1 made an incision and drew off three quarts of milky white fluid. I could not account for it I could find no light in medical litera ture. I kept tapping him, and in twenty ' seven days drew off eighteen gallons of the strange fluid. He was dropsical, but why the fluid was milky white I could not tell. I decided upon an investigation, and on Tuesday I made an incision in the abdo men. I drained him out and made an nneninir six inches in lentrth. la vine the in testines bare. They looked natural, but I reached in after bis liver and found a ma lignant sore, cancerous I should say. Then I went for his spleen and found it adhering to the abdominal walls. But this did not account for the milky color of the secretions, and I traced up the lacteal duct, which empties into left sub-clavical vein. and found a rupture. The fluid, instead of going to nourish the body, had been going to color the matter in the abdominal cavi ty. I was satisfied. I closed up the open ing in the duct, washed the man out, car- boiized him, stitched up the opening, but left a vent tube, and the man will got well. BLOODY BALLOTS.

Mr. Hendricks' Old l'liyslclan Gives the Cause of His Death. Bridorport, 111., December 3. A promi 1 neht physician, who was Mr. Hendricks' friend and attendant for a longer period than any other, states that Mr. Hendricks did not die of heart paralysis, as stated bv Indianapolis reports. He states that several years ago mr. uendncKs was stricken with paralysis. From this he never fully recovered. His father having died from degonerated blood vessels, the most rational explanation of the paralysis is that an artery of the brain burst. In a couple of years he was attacked with senile gangrene of the toes, a disease caused by degenerated blood vessels. After his toe sloughed off he recovered. Later ho dies KUddenly; the cause supposed by one physi cian to be heart failure and another to be brain clot. Enormous Bank Robbery. Pittsburgh, December 4.

TERRIFIC EXPLOSION. A Tag Boat Blown to Atoms In the East River With All Hand on Board. New York, Pecember 3. At about six o'clock this evening, while the tugboat Dora Emory was towing a stons barge up the East River, her boiler exploded oppo site Sixtieth street. The report of the ex plosion was heard at least two miles, and a number of boats put off to render assist ance, but no trace of the tug could be found, and it is believed that she sank im mediately with all hands. Tbe barge was taken in tow and made fast to a pier on Bluckwell's Island. The search for the tug and its crew was continued for some time, but no trace of either was found. Persons near the scene of the ex plosion say the tug was blown to pieces and all on board were lost, rontons living along the river front describe the explo sion as terrific. The windows of many houses in the neighborhood were com pletely shattered. Several buildings were badly shaken, and for a time great excite ment prevailed. Horace A. Green, a deck- no nd employed on tne steamer Franklin Edson, which was about 250 yards distant, savs that immediately after the explosion he put off in a boat to render assistance, but could find no trace of the tug or of any of the crew. As far as can be learned, tne crew numbered six men, and there seems little doubt that all perished. ibo killed are: Lewis Uapperatta, en gineer and half ownor of the tugboat; t-liarles Davis, cook; Gerrett Morns, cap tain; Gerrett Morris, jr., deck hand and son of the captain ; Thomas Van Housen, fireman. OUR ARMY. . General SchoHeld Argue That 80,000 Is a Number None Too Large to Use. Washington, December 8. Major-Gen- eral Schofield, commanding the Division of the Missouri, says in his annual report that his force in round numbers consists of 9,500 infantry, 5,600 cavalry, and 2S0 artillery, ag gregating 15,000 men. They occupy sixty- five different stations, giving an average of 231 men at each. He has the following to say about the means necessary to pre vent great destruction of life and property by eavatro Indians: "lne number oi In dians in this division, as reported by the Interior Department, is about 170.000. Of these about 53.000 are rated as peaceable, the remaining 123,000 being more or jess uncivilized and warlike. Tbeir warriors number at least 25,000 equal to the entire strength of the United States army, or two-thirds more than the whole number of troops serving in this division. The question to be now con sidered is whether the vast increase of the interests of life and property involv ed does not demand that such military measures be adopted as will prevent in the future any wholesale" destruction of life and property by the uncivilized tribes of the country. I beg leave to submit that in a country of 50.000.000 of people. 50,000 men would be a small army to be maintained with some reference to possible ioreign wars; but when the country has constant daily use for nine-tenths of that force to protect its people and their property against destruction by savage tribes in their midst, it is extremely unwise to limit the army to its present strengtn."
