That utterly depraved body, the elec tion board of Kentucky, has, wonderful i to relate, awarded a certificate of elec- ! tlon to the Republican contestant for j the office of governor of that state. To understand how extraordinary and ! entirely unreasonable this action is one | needs to recall the amount of abuse heaped by the Republican press on that ! body and on all those Democrats, in- 1 eluding Mr. Goebel, who aided or abetted | In any way in its creation. Was not this ' election board called into existence for | the express purpose of counting out all | Republican candidates for office, no mat- j ter what their majorities might be? | Could any such unconstitutional and au- i tocratlc body have been called into ex- j Istence, as a matter of fact, for any j other purpose than the perpetration of electoral frauds, which all good citizens ! must under all circumstances identify j with Democracy? Was it not one of the \ most urgent points made against the pos sibility of Goebel's election, that to elect < any man capable of devising such a piece ! of crooked political machinery as this ' would be to set a very high premium on fraud and force in elections? Of course it must not be lost sight of ' that there was a minority of one mem- ''' ber of the board who was not willing to ! award Taylor his certificate. But that I does not count. Besides everything else, ; that unreasonable mortal saw fit to state ■ his conviction that the certificate could i only be giver by the board after i~nor- j Ing frauds plainly committed and armed I force illegally invoked by good, God- i fearing Republican politicians. No of- i ficial capable of predicating his action j on any such allegations can be regarded 33 fit even to sit on a Kentucky Demo cratic returning board. But. while this minority of one is be- \ yond all question a totally depraved po- I lltical entity, what Is to be said regard- ' ing a canvass conducted on high moral ' precepts which results in success to the j moral agents only through the use of j tissue ballots, the presence of the mill- ■ tary under arms in the vicinity of the ; polling places on election day and the ; issuance of injunctions through a par- I tisan judiciary the very terms of which \ suffice to make the most violent partisan I that ever existed outside of Kentucky to snicker consumedly? The end, however, is not yet. There ' Is happily a body somewhere In Ken- | tucky politics with jurisdiction to throw ! out returns rendered through fraud and ! duress and which represent no honest expression of the popular will. Until such a body is finally heard from It i might be well for the moral Republican ] brother to be chary of throwing too many posies in the path of Kentucky election officials. m ILL-TKNPERED AXD ILL-NAN KERED. It is not, we apprehend, to be taken as a matter of overwhelming importance whether Comptroller McCardy should have charged his initial payment of school certificates of indebtedness to the school fund or to the certificate of In debtedness fund. He charged them to that fund which suited his purpose best at the time, and, as he is officially quite a law unto himself, there is little of practical good to come from the discus sion of the subject. It may not be plain to the ordinary understanding how a bookkeeper can find it consistent with the correctness of his books to charge pay ments of the same nature, made at dif ferent times, to. different accounts; but there Is nothing in Mr. McCardy's official methods which should lead to the ex pectation that they might come within the compass of the ordinary understand ing. It is the chicane and boorishness which underlie the comptroller's answer to a polite inquiry on the part of th« stat« j public examiner which should receive public attention. The official is quite an expert in working the columnß of the newspapers of his party for the accom plishment of his own ends. He has rare ly shown this faculty more impressively than in the mode adopted by him of answering the public examiner's cour teous Inquiry. He refuses to offer any explanation of the transaction, but, rush- Ing off to his newspaper organs with the complaint that his brusque letter of re fusal—for that is the effect of his letter to the examiner—has not been published, proceeds to indulge himself In an ex planatory Interview, which makes noth ing so plain as his own bad manners ami his ill temper. If McCardy is willing to let that so called explanation stand, every other per son Interested should be. Aside from its bad taste, it Is little more than a plea which involves a confession of his act and an avoidance of the inevitable con sequences of it. We hope, however, that the state examiner's office will not be de terred by McCardy's Insolent hectoring from making the amplest examination which its resources will admit of con cerning the operations of the city comp troller's office. ——-^»- A CASE TO BE LOOKED INTO. It is altogether a remarkable case which is prevented by the arrest and conviction in Minneapolis of a young woman of good attainments and standing as a profession al singer, on the charge of petit larceny. Te girl was evidently in want at the time the charge was made against her. But the facts of the alleged larceny, so far as they can be judged from reports, were not quite consistent with any crim inal intent. Indeed, the facts of the en tire transaction, out of which grew her possession of the jacket which was made the subject of the charge, and this charge itself, are not easily comprehen sible. It is more than doubtful whether the young woman couid have been convicted of larceny on the mere possession of the jacket, together with the evidence of the owner, as against the explanation offered by the young woman. But, at tended by the statements of the police that she was a woman of disreputable character, there was hardly any recourse left open to the court, if it believed the policeman's testimony, but to commit her to the workhouse on the non-payment of the fine Imposed. Except among known conscientious members of the police force the imputa tion of dishonor cast upon a woman un der arrest by a police officer is of no more value than the dicer's oath. Expe rience shows that not all officers who are daily called on to lift their hands in the taking of an oath in .a police court have any rational sense of the sanctity of the oath they take. Was tnls young woman's liberty sacrificed and her char acter blasted by such testimony? Unless the officer or officers testifying as to the girl's character were known to the court to be under all circumstances worthy of absolute credence, or unless the evi dence as to the character was given with such circumstantial fullness as to carry conviction with it, there was a cruel wrong done in accepting it at all, or in allowing It to influence the action of the court. This is more especially the case if the original testimony as to the com mission of the offense was itself at all open to question. The fact that the young woman has been released on the payment of the fine ] by her friends adds to rather than takes j away from the possible injury done her. It confirms the chaige against her, and I fastens the imnutation of guilt more se curely even than if she had served her sentence. If. as is intimated will be the case, Mayor Gray takes the'matter un- ! der consideration, it will be in his power I to undo what may involve a grievous i wrong. He can make an independent ex amination into the facts, we presume, by virtue of hi.s authority over the police department. If he should find that there is any substantial doubt as to the credibility of the testimony as to the larceny itself, his official declaration that the mere testimony of a police officer as j to character, whether well or ill founded, i does not constitute corroboration in any true sense will help materially to relieve tha young woman of the Imputation of being j a thief. If, on the other hand, he finds ! that the testimony of the officer or of- i fleers in the case assailing the woman's ! character *3 not well founded, he has it In his power to do the woman a much needed act of justice. In any event it is to be hoped that the mayor will make the whole matter a subject of independent Investigation. ABOUT THE PEOPLE'S WISHES. Mr. Ambrose Tighe is entitled to the thanks of the community for directing the attention of his associates on the charter commission to the fact that their duty is to prepare a new chx-.rter, and that the disposition which the people may make of their work is entirely outside their sphere to consider. There seems somehow to be a superabundance of posi tive knowledge among certain members of the charter commission concerning what the people will accept and what they will reject in the way of change^ in the present instrument. Yet no one has pointed out the source of this special knowledge; and it is very doubtful, in deed, If any such knowledge exists. In this behalf it Is to be said that if the members of the comnvssion will ex amine the work of their predecessors they can very readily find wherein that work was effective In securing the dis approval of the voters of St. Paul. The knowledge which they will come by in this way will assist them, if not to the all-embracing knowledge of the pec.ple's preferences which certain of them claim to possess, at least to an understanding of what changes are reasonably certain to secure the defeat of any charter which they may offer to the public. If they will look up the contemporary expres sions of opinion as to the fate of the proposed charter, they will find that no one seriously thought when it was pre sented that there was any possibility of its being accepted. The Globe believes that the people are willing to go much further in in dorsing changes in the present charter than the commission is likely to go in THE ST. 

PAUL GLOBE, MONDAY DECEMBER 11, 1899. formulating such changes; and it has quite as much to sustain it in the con tention as have these charter commis sioners, like Mr. F. B. Doran, who would have the old charter re-enacted with the provision for the adjustment of school finances. If the commission confines itself to of fering a provision as to the school funds it will simply ignore the purpose for which it was treated. Its first duty is to present such a provision as will with stand the test of the courts, an under taking itsdf not the easiest in the world. It would not bo a bad Idea if, after hav ing this, it would give a little thought to the facility with which valuable public franchises may be given away, and see whether they cannot devise something of a check on the common council in this re gard. It would be safe to assure the commission that any reasonable provision along that lin9 which it may choose to adopt is not likely to suffer defeat by the popular vote. We have heard a good deal in the recent past as to what the officeholders will and will not countenance. We do not believe that the charter commission is disposed to pay any attention whatever to this sort of talk. Yet, if the commission feels itself at liberty to refrain from doing anything in the direction of simplifying or cheapening our present involved and expensive local government machine, it will bo fulfilling the wishes of the office holders and ignoring the needs of the city, as well as the wishes of its people. THE 

TRAXS-SIBEIUAX RAILWAY. The statement has been made in some newspapers that the Russian Trans-Si berian railroad will be completed and opened for traffic next spring. This is not so. The Trans-Siberian railroad is yet far from being completed. It is stated that this month is will be completed to Stretinsk, and Stretinsk is 2,733 versts, or about 1,748 miles, from Vladivostock, the Pacific terminus of the line. But the completion of the road to this point con nects the railroad with river navigation to the Pacific ocean by the Shika and Amoor rivers, and establishes rail and river connections during the rummer months, when the streams are open to navigation, between St. Petersburg and Vladivostock. At least two years must c.apse before Russia, under the most fa vorable conditions, can complete its great railroad, and the government, as a mat ter of fact, does not contemplate the completion of the line before 1903. By that time, so swiftly do events succeed each other in these days, Vladivostock n-.ay be In possession of Japan cr some other nation possessing greater naval strength than Russia on the Pacific ocean, and the present states in the far East may be completely changed, and in any case many years must elapse before Russia can be regarded as a strong com mercial competitor of the United States in China and for the far Asiatic trade. A Montana "divine healer," when threatened with assault by a man whom j he had insulted, called upon God to pro- j tect him, and his assailant dropped dead. One unfortunate feat/ure of this sad affair is that the "divine, healer" will for the rest of his natural life labor under the delusion that there was a direct interpo sition of Providence in his favor, and many simple persons will share his belief.

So Aguinaldo turns up in the province of Cavite, his old stamping ground, and the weary work of rounding him up be gins all over again.

The Caliph of Bagdad will soon be able to visit Berlin in a Pullman coach, trav eling over the new German railway. This is enough to make Haroun Al Raschid turn somersaults in his grave. Paderewski and Mrs. Paderewski have arrived in New York and there will now be a chance to satisfy the curiosity of American women as to whether or not his wife makes him wear hair-ribbons. The rules of the French chamber of deputies should be amended so as to have the revised Queensberry rules apply to debates. It would be much easier for the members. They would last longer. An Illinois man has been detected put ting poison in baked beans. In Boston he would have been promptly strung up. Strange to say there has been no ap parent disposition to put Mr. Roberts through the Hobson process. A man named Meek was arrested in Chicago for beating his fiancee with a poker. What's in a name?

MUSIC AND THE STAGE. METROPOLITAN. There was a flavor of old English com edy in "The Royal Box," an adaptation by the late Charles Coghlan, presented last evening at the Metropolitan. The philosophy is the philosophy of Dryden, Farquhar and Wycherly, with the gross ness of these old-time playwrights wiped ay. ay, and the piece left clean and whole some. Then, too, there was a modern innova tion to prove its Americanism, and the roya) box, draped in crimson and bearing the English coronet, was a real box in the theater, and the Drury Lane audience, addressed by the Drury Lane manager in the way of apology for the supposed in disposition of Clarence, was the Sunday night audience of the Metropolitan theater. There Is every element of success in "The Royal Box" In the hands of such stars as Andrew Robson and Miss Cogh lan. Seldom is pathos mingled with comedy so consistently as in the part of Celia Pryce, as portrayed by Miss Cogh lan. "She is not acting," one could almost believe, "she Is the winsome stage-struck beauty of real life: the matinee girl of the modern theater." A^d it is saich deft touches as this that link the old English comedy element of the piece with fin-du- siecle dramatization. As truly as Shelly was a poet for poets, so is "The Royal Box" a play for players. - The plot is not deep, but breezy. From the Prince of Wales' set Into the Bohemia of an actor's life the audience Is swiftly carried, and as swiftly brought back again. The prince is as cynical and chivalrous as history makes him, and not nearly so gross. Indeed, in the hands of James W. Bankson, there is a Mephls tophelian touch imparted to the character which, on the whole, is rather winning and catchy. He plays the part as a man who knows the world and is bound to get the mo.«t he can out of it. The plot? Simtaly k love complication between a popujbt English actor of the old school, Mr. (Jlbrence, and the wife of Count Felsen, Swedish ambassador to England. From a compromising situation, in the rooms of Actor Clarence, the coun tess Is rescued by the Prince of Wales, who also adds {an explanatory letter which fully frees the sorely harassed countess from the implication of having left her fan In the apartments of Clar ence. And It is^Celfa Pryce who really loves the popular'actor, and the curtain falls on a most enjoyable play, with Clar ence Introducing Miss Pryce to the Prince of Wales, both on the eve of sailing for America, with the stage-struck beauty as Clarence's leading lady. It must have been evident, even to the most critical in the audience, that for the winsome Miss Coghlan there is a brilliant future. As Clarence, Mr. Hobson carries a dif ficult part to successful conclusion. The i breaking up of the balcony scene in "Romeo and Juliet," and his denunciation of the Prince of Wales, evoked enthusias tic applause, and in the third act, "The Cat and the Fiddle Inn," numerous cur tain calls were responded to by Mr. Rob son and Miss Coghlan. Thomas Mc- Larney might have spoiled his part with a dialect, but he has the excellent judg ment to refrain from the temptation. Charles Chappelle, as Tipp, the Bow street officer, carried the comedy part successfully, sharing this spice of all dramas with P. M. Austey, as Mont morency. and Edward Davis, as Marma duke, actors of Drury Lane. Countess Helen, the flirting, yet heart less wife of the Swedish ambassador, was well played by Lotta Linthicum. The Juliet of Louise Grey, not being the stock Juliet of modern times, is, of course be yond praise or cavil.

Walter Fe^s lers clever drama, opened a week's en gagement last evening to a crowded au dience at the Grand. As the title implies it Is a story of New York Jife, and the-e is an abundance of realistic stage effects The plot, which is replete with action and incident, deals with the adventures of Tom Saunders, a New York boy who believing his sweetheart is to marry George Leighton, a society man, waylays Leighton and tries to murder him at Grant's tomb. Afterwards, believing that he had succeeded. Saunders flies to Mon tana and becomes an engineer. Leighton, who recovers, turns train robber, and the two meet. Of course, Saunders tri umphs over the villain, and there is a railroad wreck, most realistically deplet ed, that adds to the general Interest. The company is remarkably well bal anced. Walter Fessler, as Jack Morgan, a gambler, is- a thost realistic "knight of the cards." Henry Bagge is a typical 1 New York boy as "Tom Saunders." George Hope does good work as the con ductor of the train- that is wrecked,. James Devlin does a clever newsboy turn and Henry Buckley: makes a most ac ceptable engineer. On the women in the cast, Annie Ward Tiffany, one of the most artistic Irish character artists in the profession, gives an admirable representation of Emily i Saunders, Tom's mother. Miss Louise j Jeffries does a Bowery act that is fin- | ished and artistic, aqd Nellie Montrose, i the broker's daughter;- is characterized with effect by Miss Nellie McEwen. Miss Nettie McGuire does good work as I Daisy McGuire, the flower girl. "The City of New York" all the week, with matinees Wednesday and Saturday. SMART SHORT STORIES. Judge Martin Grover, of Troy, N. V., was at one time approached by a young citizen who wished to be nominated to the state assembly. The shrewd old judge had certain doubts about him, which he expressed somewhat freely, and yet he was willing to afford him a trial. He therefore addressed the aspirant in this way: "Young man, if you will give me your word that you won't steal when you get to Albany I'll see what kin he done about pendin' you there." "Judge Grover," replied the young man, drawing himself up with great dignity, "I'll go to Albany unpledged or I don't go at all." • • ♦ The New York Herald was represented at the Dreyfus trial at R.ennes by Marcel Provost.

Ji WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—(Special.)— Members of the Minnesota house delega tion have not been unanimous In en deavoring to seeura the chairmanships which they would like and which, if they could -have agreed, would have been bene ficial to the whole state. The trouble seems to have been that in considering these questions separately and in a body there were too many ambitious men con testing for these places, and the outcome foreshadows the defeat of a good many who desire various places. It may be stated that the ones anxious to beat their own colleagues will probably be left out in the cold. Frequent consultations were held last spring and during the summer and this fall between the different Minne sota members regarding committee as signments during the Fifty-sixth con gress, and with one or two exceptions there was an agreement. There was at least one man, however, who attempted to secure good assignments for himself with out informing his colleagues of his pur pose, thus preventing the delegation from presenting the proper support to secure due consideration from the new speaker. The man who has held out, evidently with the desire to dodge and to gain some advantage, is. it is now predicted, the one man in the delegation who will receive less consideration from Gen. Henderson than any other man. The committee an nouncements, soon to be made, will prove the truth of this assertion, and at that time the member of the delegation who sought certain positions without consult ing his colleagues will receive no more consideration from the speaker than would a new member coming to the house to represent his district. The majority of the Minnesota delegation therefore is not in an amiable frame of mind, and the difficulty growing out of this may widen the breach between the Republican mem bers. Something may be gained or lost because of this contest, but the people of Minnesota will soon be aware of all the details, and therefore be able to pick out the man who Is giving the delegation more trouble than any other member of it, and who has probably prevented the advancement of other members because of his efforts to get the better of his colleagues on important committees. • ♦ • The flood of bills in both houses of congress during the first week of the ses sion foreshadows some time in the future a reform necessary to prevent a waste of money upon the part of both houses. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mem bers of both the senate and house shower ed bills upon the heads of unsuspecting clerks and burled them deeply under printed paper. There is no reason why any such course should be taken by the representatives of the people of the Unit ed States, for the reason that the result will not be beneficial and the expense of taking care of these measures will be great. In the senate last Wednesday 856 bills were introduced, something over 300 reso lutions and petitions going into the thou sands. This is the greatest day that the senate has ever experienced. It exceed ed all former great days for bills and resolutions, an increase so large that the clerks looking after them worked day and night in order to get them to the government printing office. • • • I have interviewed some of the brightest > men in the capitol who deal with mat ters of this kind, the principal of whom has been a bill - clerk for more than twenty years. He had an interesting story to tell, and it rray be well for the people of the country to know how their money is expended, and how their rep resentatives expect to get advertising without using any effort to benefit them. Reprinted bills form the principal part of the flood during the first week of this session. Many of these measures, I have been told, have repeatedly been reintro duced for a period anywhere from two to twenty years. They come in every year, and the clerks if they had their hats on would take them off to the various measures they receive, for many are to them very old friends. It seems to be a hcbby on the part of many congressmen to reintroduce bills. They simply scratch out the name of the man who previously Introduced them, insert their own, and they go into the Congressional Record, and in many -ases throughout the coun try, as original measures. As a matter of fact these representa tives and senators are perfectly aware that not more than five out of the hun dred bills they may push in to the clerks in either branch will ever see daylight. However, the government is forced to pay for all the extra work growing out of the introduction of these bills and resolutions, and the expense is enormous. Even Den who have knowledge of the exact situation regarding this course on the part of members are unable to tell just what it costs the government. It is only necessary to spend an hour or two in the government printing office to dis cover what the real situation is, and about what the government is forced to pay to advertise members who introduce and reintroduce bills which they have no expectation whatever wfU become laws I at this or any other session. Dead men are frequently placed before congress for consideration and referred to committees, which pigeonhole the bills without, in many instances, even glancing at them. The moral in all this is that if the mem bers of congress who seek advertising in this way would devote their time to look ing out for the interests of their con stituents the increase in measures of various kinds introduced and frequently would be cut down. At the present time both wings of the capitol are submerged by fool measures, and the members who introduced them are per fectly well aware of the fact that they will never become laws, and that a ma jority of them will never be considered by the committees to which they will be referred. • • • There is an interesting fact which has probably been overlooked by the presi dent and other financiers in relation to the message which he delivered to con gress last Tuesday.

WORLD GOLD OUTPUT DIRECTOR ROBERTS SAYS IT WILL. SOON BE $-100,000,000 PER ANNUM REPORT FROM THE MINTS Figures for the Year Presented to Congrna Show That the Coinage In the United States Was Heavier Last Year Than Ever Before—De crease In the Visible Gold Supply of European Countries. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.— Mr. Roberts, the director of the mint, In his annual re port, says: The mints and assay offices operated upon more bullion in the aggregate, and a greater coinage was executed during the last fiscal year than in any previous year. Original deposits of gold were slightly less than during the previous year, amounting in value to $143,497,190, against $147,693,194 in the fiscal year end ed June 30, 1898. Domestic deposits were the largest In our history, amounting to $76,25£,357, against $69,881,120 In the preced ing year, but there was a falling off in foreign coin and bars. The coinage of gold was the greatest in our history, amounting to $108,177,180, against $64,634,865 in the preceding year, and might have been considerably larger if the capacity of the mints had been greater. The stock of gold bullion on hand increased from $96,688,582 on July 1, 1898, to $119,882,772 on July 1, 1899. The coinage of silver dollars from bul lion purchased under the act of July 14, 1890, was $18,254,709, against $10,002,750 in the preceding year, and the coinage of subsidiary silver was $9,466,877, against $6, --482,804. The mints have been hard pressed throughout the year to meet the demands upon them, the institutions at New Or leans and Philadelphia running over time for the greater part of the year. The mint facilities of the country will be taxed to their utmost until the new buildings under construction at Philadel phia and Denver are completed and equip ped. The stock of gold bullion is ac cumulating and with the present pressure for subsidiary coinage cannot be reduced. Fortunately the large cash balance in the treasury permits at this time an unusual stock of bullion without embarrassment, but congress should at the approaching session make an appropriation for the equipment of the new Philadelphia mint. The building is well advanced towards completion, and, as the power plant and much of the machinery will require con siderable time for construction, the con tracts for the same should be let during the coming year. 

CHARGE ON BARS. When the present charges for refining silver were adopted they were applicable to the conditions then existing, and the government refineries received a share of the business. But the cost of treatment ha.s declined and the charges of private concerns have been reduced, while' the government charges have remained fixed The effect has naturally been to send the silver bullion to private refineries. While there is no good reason why the govern ment should enter into unnecessary com petition with some concerns it is desirable so long as it conducts refineries it should do so in economical and businesslike manner. The total amount of sliver bul lion refined in the United States last year was in round numbers 94,000,000 ounces The superintendent of the New York assay office, the report says, has called ™™™ \° V^ faCt that> althou&h about $30,000,000 in United States coin was ex ported last year, no bars were taken for export and suggests that the "export charge of one-tenth of 1 per cent, which is exacted, is operating to our disadvan tage. Ihere is no object, says Director Roberts in forcing the public to take our coin out of the country by making it more expensive to take bar silver. We had better furnish the raw material than the manufactured article. These bars will i^Y? *° *c sshe*i ™ c*e * from New York to Snw^ 1^ meUed and worked inS coin with some waste and considerable whHe Th X reP'aCe the COln «Ported! while the bars would have served every purpose for export. y 

GOLD IMPORTS. The total gold imports -of the year S^T^VVff 8 '882' and "ports W?.- S?'?s'-? he total silver imports were $31,120,0/8, commercial.value, and silver exports $56,655,335. The atock of bullion in the mints and assay offices on July 1, 1899, was as fol lows: Gold, $119,882,772; silver (cost) $85- D 0.898. During the year $1,168,851 in'worn and uncurrent gold coins were received with a loss of $10,543, and $8,558,076 of worn and unsubsidiary silver was recoined with a loss of $485,797, the seigniorage on the coinage of silver dollars during the year amounted to $5,520,145; on subsidiary silver, $86,838; on nickels and pennies $698,729. The coinage of all nations, ml ; chiding recoinages. in 189S was: Gold ! $385,477,905; silver, $149,282,f>35. The government has now practically no bullion available for the coinage of sub | sidiary currency. It has bullion pur- I chased for the coinage of silver dollars, | but thi3 cannot be used without authori ty from congress. The needs of the coun try for fractional currency are increas ing, and legislative authority for new | coinage j s imperatively demanded. Stocks of gold In sight in Europe in creased by about 50 per cent from Decem ber, 1892. to Dec. 31, 1597. From the latter date to Dec. 31. 1898, the stocks instead of continuing to increase showed a diminution. The Bank of England and the Imperial | Bank of Germany both show a loss of ! gold during the year, but the record of i the exports and imports of Great Britain and Germany show that each of those countries received about $30,000,000 more gold than it parted with. Trade was very active in both countries, and apparently drew on the reserve stocks of the two leading banking institutions. ELASTIC CURRENCY. It is of special Interest that the stock of uncovered bank notes In Germany was j $24,000,000 greater on Dec. 31, 189$. than ! on Dec. 31, 1897, and was $36,000,000 greater ; in France-. That illustrates the elasticity \ which enables the monetary system of ] those countries to ease off such an ex traordinary demand for gold as the Unit ed States made on the world last year. The Austro-Hungarian bank had $17,000, --000 more of uncovered paper out at the end of the year than at the beginning. Three countries had o\it about $78,000,000 more of srold bank notes than the year before, a fact that doubtless contributed much to ease the financial situation. The ability to thus enlarge the stock of paper currency is favorable to a country in the event of any sudden call upon It for heavy payments In gold. The most notable change in gold stocks during the year was in the United States. The stock of coin in the country, includ ing bullion in the mints, on Jan. 1. IS9B. was estimated at $745,245,953, and on Jan. 1. IS)9, at $945,798,758, a gain of $200,002,835. The gain appears in the following items: Stock, Jan. 1, 1898. $745,245,953; net im ports of United States coin. $33,082,718; coinage during the year, $77,985,758; gain in bullion in mints, $94,770,430; total, $951. --084,859; United States coin remelted at mints, $1,330,741; taken by paymasters to Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philippines. $2, --455,330; used in manufactures, $1,500,000; total. $5,286,071; stock, Jan. 1, 1899. $945, --798.788. Of the Increased stock shown by the above statement, $159,632,840 appears in the reports of national banks and the government treasury. The holdings of the former must be taken for Dec. 15, 1597, and Dec. 1, IS9B. their nearest statements to Jan. 1 being on those dates. They show holdings as below: Treasury, Jan. 1, 1898, $197,767,142; national banks Dec 15 1897, $187,608,644; total. $385,375,786; treasury' Jan. 1, 1899, $281,119,881; national banks' Dec. 1, 1898, $263,888,745. Total, $.145,008,626! Gain in treasury and national banks $159,632,840. The difference between this and the aggregate gain estimated for the country, $40,919,995, is considered to have gone into state and private banks and general circulation. GOLD PRODUCTION. The production of gold in all the im portant gold fields of the world is in creasing rapidly and with prospects of continued gains for years to come. The yield in the world in the calendar year 189S was $387,000,000, against $33,000,000 in 1897. The production in Australia to date in 1599 has shown a gain of 25 per cent over the corresponding months of 1898, which Indicates a probable gain for the full year of $16,000,000. The United States, Canada and Mexico will doubtless in crease the product $18,000,000. In South Africa the production in the first half of the year was 35 per cent above the yield of the same months in 1898 and If the industry had been undisturbed the gain for the year would probably have been above $20,000,000. It is not improb able that when operations are fully re sumed in South Africa the world's output will quickly pass $400,000,000 per annum The effect of this new flood of standard money upon the markets, the industries, the earnings of those who work for wages and all of the varied relations of the people In our present highly organized society will be a most interesting study. It will inevitably be a potent factor in af iciirs 

BERLIN MOXEV STATUS. Condition of the Market (ontii.uea to Be a Matter of Concern. BERLIN, Dec. 10,-The money market situation continues to be the chief con cern of the German business world. Lon don exchange continued to rise all last week. Gold exports are now possible, and therefore an increase in the bank rate is considered virtually certain. The officials of the Reichsbank were in consultation yesterday on the subject, and there was a general sentiment in favor of an ad vance to 7 per cent. A definite decision is likely to be taken Tuesday. The Reichsbank statement yesterday showed much less improvement than la usual at this time of the year. Private accounts, after rising to a point near the official rate, eased off some yesterday, but the rise In the London private rate causes an expectation here that the Bank of England will yet make another raise Thus far, however, money market condi tions do not inspire a feeling of per manent trouble in Berlin, a feeling of as surance arisii g from the fact that Ger man circulation is so thoroughly saturat ed with gold that any considerable de rangement is impossible. Today a high financial authority gave the correspondent of the Associated Press an estimate of the gold in circulation in Germany, placing this at 2,500.000 000 marks, and predicted that the industrial situation would continue very strong. ALASKAN MINING LAWS. Complaint Made A*aln«t Abases Which Are Said to Exist. To the Editor of the Globe- President McKinley, in bis recent mes sage to congress, very ably touches on the urgent needs of Alaska, which is un doubtedly very gratifying to those who have any interests there, and especially so to those who have lived there during the last year, but to my mind the point which is of th<? most vital importance to. the welfare of the people and the future | development of Alaska has not been touched upon, and that is our present mining laws. True, we have United States mining laws which are supposed to govern in Alaska, but I am convinced that they are inadequate, primitive and too much out of date to be effective The foundation of the law I refer to was established in 1572, and with a few amendments it has done service ever since. At that time, and I am sorry to ?ay up to the present, there has existed a primitive idea among our statesmen and mining men that laws could not be established that would be practical in all localities and under all conditions. As a result, some of tho most vital points have been left open to be disposed of by the miners to suit themselves, under an ; act enabling them to call a miners' meet j ing and enact laws to any extent, so ; long as they do not conflict with the ■ United States mining laws, and so far as | placer mining laws are concerned there ; Is but little with which to conflict. I am convinced beyond the .shadow of a doubt that laws can be enacted by con gress that are applicable to the govern ment of miners and mining under any and all circumstances. Why miners should not be governed by a ! regular code of laws as are citizens in ; any other walk of life involves a ques tion too ridiculous to admit of discus sion. This open condition of our United : States mining laws leaves far too many 1 opportunities for the practice of abuses , which have at no previous time since the i earliest history of mining in this or any ! other country run so rampant as at pres ■ ent at Cape Nome, Cape York and other j Alaska districts. Under our present laws a miner is allowed to locate twenty acres ■ of placer mining ground, and while it | establishes the exact number of acres he i can hold it makes no mention whether I this shall be all he can hold in the dis • trict or on a creek or gulch, and as a j result the first men on the ground at ■ Cape Nome and surrounding camps in '■ terpreted the law to suit themselves and located claims on every creek, gulch and bench they could find, twenty acres to ' the claim in every district, with the ex ! ception of Cape York, where the local j laws have set the limit to five hundred j feet up and down the creek. In this way : any one can readily see how easy it is for : a small number of men to locate and monopolize an entire district, or the ■whole country for that matter, as many j men in Alaska now hold claims in every district within a radius of three hundred miles, covering no less than six regularly organized districts. This is. however, not the only abuse practiced. I refer to the power of at torney, as it i<» indiscriminately used in locating Alaskan claims. By this means j one man may locate, and men have lo cated, over two thousand acres instead j of twenty. As a remedy I would sug- I gest that congress enact a law limiting • miners to one claim in a district, and let ' the size of the claim be fixed and un alterable: abolish the power of the enact i ment of local laws by miners or any oth er organization, and as a means of pre venting abuses of the law affix a penalty on trying to hold land illegally. It would also be well to establish same definite area which a distiict should con tain. Should it be legal to locate by power of attorney the right should be abolished, as it is not only the rankest of iniustice, but a positive detriment to the development of the mining interests of our country. Our government has never tolerated tho use of the power .of attorney by its citizens in locating horn '- steads, or any other form of claiming portions of the public domain, and I ran see no valid reason why it should ba recognized in locating mining ground. There was an attempt made on the part of some of the later arrivals at Cape Nome to reorganize the district in order to abolish the abuses practiced, and a meeting was called. A resolution waa drawn up to be read and discussed, and then voted on, but before action could be taken on the matter a company of armed soldiers was marched into the hill and the miners were given two minutes to leave the hall, and were marched out at the point of the bayonet. This c im pany of roldlers was stationed at Capa Nome early in the season, and the camp placed under martial law, the soldiers do ing police duty, even making arrests in civil cases, and this is another abuse our government should be ashamed of, as there was at no time any occasion for military Interference. —P.
