THE DAILY APPEAL -. R. fuHCiMEL-S:::: WXDHTIDAT HORHIXG. DEC. 5. 1866 rSEPAKIRO TO AVOID BSEAHM AHEAD roHGRE3SIOAL CAUCUS. YankreUtn is what Andy Johnson asl William II. Seward are impatient of io their opposition to the radicals in Congress. The growing political con sequence of Xew England notions is what pesters the Secretary of State. Sewjr ! b'.nks Yankeeiom vulgar and presumptuous ; and A. Johnson, in bis ' nmble" way, hates il and they both hare set their hearts spainst it because it U irrepressible r.nd utignllibie. But it is a tough and aggressive bramble, is Yaokeeism, and neither vulgar Andy nor sneering William can root it out J nor cbokt it down, nor scare it into nn- obstrnsiveness, any more than those other hater of it, the alive holders and secessionists did. And it will lire and spread in spite of its unpopularity with those shabby genteel seedling!, the "Knickerbockers" whose musty gen tility make Seward, like them, more European than American in their favor ite ideas ; and in spite of the blackguard crusade which floundering Andy has sought to inangurate against it. Ttioe horribly ungenel fellows, " the radical " hare commenced work again ; and ther seem to disregard the delicacies of social amenities altogether. They hare berun slashing away at the IIumMe Individual's appointments ; and they have actually proposed a law which is designed to neutralize my policy" altogether. They r .t only ad vise the Senate to reject all the Presi dent's political appointment?, but thev have actually gone so far as to propose a law changing the time for the conven ing of Congress so as to make it p js aible for the 40th Congress to meet on the 4tb of March next, thereby prevent ing a recess in which Andy might play aome vextitiously high pranks to the in dignation, if not the discomfiture, of '.he radicals in and out of Congress. Those lymphatic gentlemen with whom the g iut is nn anxioii.ly hoped lor attainment and whose affected ele gance of breeding is diluted into a pro per Consistency by virtue of a "con erratum which conserves nothing better than its own profitless conceits, will no doubt feel sadly shocked at the renewal by Congress of their measures 'or bringing our dpluded Sonthern m iheren to an open understanding of '.he sturJy determination of the Yan sees to reconstruct this Xation after their own severe model. It so happens that the rebels have mad" it a matter of history that '- the Yankees " is th same of the foes who whipped them ; and thry may rest assnred that trios v . i. ... i anke.-s mean WDat tnrr Lave said at their elections just held. TIXLDI5S TO THE LOGIC OF EVE3TT3 t is a sulky dignity that possesses the old, nionldr, bad sm-llir;r aristocrats of the South. When that troublesome ami eapensire faculty once g'ts np, it is mighty hard for it to come dnwn When it sulks, it is chronic and inrnrahle But it has been pretty mnrb of a laugh ing stuck ever since Jeff Davis was caught in an aqua trula and an old hood Bat laughter only makes this ponderous. wooien dignity all ttie mire puflv.

Kut something or other is grn dually but very surely takme that vain boasting, eiopt conceit aat of tbe( SoulbsTners. A people cannot live npon air, and this chivalry business, now that slavery is dead, is as utterly want ing in substance as the vapors that fan the top of Mount Shasta. Already is the question of impartial suffrage being seriously discussed in States that were among the first to pass ordinances of secession. The proposition to erect the negro to a full citizen, with the right of suffrage entrusted to bim, is being moot ed, without danger to its advocates, in communities, where, five years ago, a scheme of even gradual emancipation would have secured its agitator a coat of tar and feathers. ' Reconstruction" is progressing, marvellously, grievously hindered as it is ; and it is a pretty safe conclusion that the whole ' Confedera cy " will slip away from Johnson and throw itself upon the clemency of Con gress, begging to go ta the furthest ex tremes of the requirements of radical ism, long before the 40lb Congress shall ave ended its term. Practical sense nd an appreciation of the logic of events are being rapidly developed at the South ; and when they once get the better of that sodden dignity that we ave alluded to, and of that savage passion wbich is simply rumanism. Southerners will be fitted for a partici pation in, aud a wholesome enjoyment f the form of National government which tbey struggled so long, so bitter ly and so vainly to destroy. BT TATE TELEGHAPH- From the Gold Hill News of yesterday. Jfiw York, December 3. The Her- Id's Washingtou special dispatch says: Mr. Botitwell, of Massachusetts, at the Republican Caucns last night, said that a Special Committee should be appoiut- d, whose duty it would be to inquire nto the subject of the impeachment of he President; and the suggestion met n-ith the hearty co-operation of a!!, lie will introduce a resolution at the earliest opportunity after the assembling of ,'ongress, for the appointment of a Joint Committee to investigate the conduct and course of the President, and report what action it will he necessary for Cong'ess to take. It is lo stated in Washington, that Mr. Sctienck, of thio. will introduce a bill soon, to assemble he Fortieth Congress on the 5th of March. The World's Washington special says: The President, iu his message to Con gress, adheres firmly to his restoration olicy, and argues at length in favor of he immediate admission to Congress i f luly qualified local representatives from the South. Of Foreign Affairs, he says with great effort the progress toward the adjust ment of the Alabama question has be n slow, owing, in some deeree. to the arge in the I'.ritish Minstry. But matters in that regard look f ivorable. He states that France has not yet complied with her agreement to ta-ke iirr troops out of Mexico, but has in timated a postpunmeot until Snrine- fliis the Government has remonstrated eainst, but the President says no reply has been received from the Emperor as (o what he will do. A satisfactory adjustment is hoped far. General Sherman has merely pone to Mexico in an advisory capacity for Min- s:er Campbell. The message is silent on the questions of the Mexican protectorate and treaties. tad makes no allusion to Maximilian whatever. The Hetald's Milledgeville (Georgia) corrrspondent Slates tliat the reasons lor trie rejection of the Constitutional mcnimnt by the Georgia Legislature were, that there were fiO guarantiee iliven that a restoration of the State to tae Union would f.dlow its adoption. and that the people consider it the bigl t of ingratitude to disfranchise tho.-e vtho were lately their sol. tiers. They have begun to look calmly at the possibility of i tZTn suffrage as a means of re ad mission: but it is still reioltug to them. A biil is under consideration in the Georgia Legislature lookirg to the es tablishment of common schools for whites and blacks throughout the State, and it is I r ibah it w.li be passed. Emigration from the North is encour aged, and much capital bus already flowed in from that section. Naw Yoai, December 3 Tbs Times Washington Special dispatck says of the arrest of John n . Surratt s It appears, at we learn from official sources, that Surratt. was arrested in Italy, as heretofore reported, whilst in the Papal Zouaves, and afterwards es caped. The Pope promptly gave the necessary orders for his arrest npon the request of our Minister," Mr. King, not withstanding there was no treaty be tween the United States and the Papal Governments binding the latter to grant the request. Sarrati "as traced after bis escape to Egypt and arrested as stated." As incidental to the above, it may be stated that Mr. Rcutwell, of Massachu setts, in the caucus, on Saturday even ing, made the statement that the Gov ernment had known of the whereabouts of Surratt for six months. Wasrmgto, December 3. The fol lowing has been received at the State Department by the Cable : I have arrested John H. Surratt, one of President Lincolu s assassins. No doubt of bis identity.

The Reese River Reveille of November 30th has the following late nutters of interest relating to Puliranagnt : The prospeets of this remote and hitherto inacccsMble district, are just now very en couraging. Late explorations have opened a shoit and direct route from Austin to the very core of that ditriut, so easy and so free from the ordinary natural obstacles, that it is said loaded wagons will experience no diffi culty in making the trip in a short time. Instead of lay his; "the other iile of Jordan," ith a yanuilll; "death valKy" between it and the minim; communities of the central aiidwtstern portions of the State, it is found to be e.isilv accessible, over a better natural road than conuectg Austin and irginia Citv. and la consequence it splendid property and surroundings will soon become known and appreciated. " e have lust had a brief conversation with Mr. T. L. Lane, who ar rivrd in this city over the new route a few dat s asto, after a number of mouths residence in Pahranagat, in the course of which we learned that the five stamp mill of the Pioneer Company, erected under the superintendence of Mr. Raymond, was completed and would tie put in luotion the day af er his party left, that is, on the 19th inst. It is designed to roast the ore, and reverberatorv furnaees of the usual model were in the course of erection. Among hundieds of fine locations, the Illi nois ledoe at present stands foremost, mainly perhaps because it is more fully developed, and has been cotiipelh d to reveal glimpses of ts vast snd lonjr hidden treasure. Seventy five to one hundred tons of its rieh mineral have been extracted readv for the null. Mr. Lane bioii"lit with him a number of tine specimens of the ores of the district, which are more various and as rici as c.n he obtained in any section of the region. In his unique collcciion tin re is a large and beautiful crystal of salt procured from a mountain eighty miles south of the district of Pahranavat. Apparently the whole mountain is salt siiiiieient to preserve Mor- motidoni, it to sweeten the " filthy pool" of polities amen they oiast and breiik upnuh powder, as grauite is broken up. The specimen in tiie hands of Mr. Line is about half an inch thick and nearly two inches bro, .1, and is beautifully translucent. We U arn that Mr. Lane iroes westward for the puriMise of procuring a portable saw mill to lake into the district for general use, and to facilitate his plan for supplwuu tuc tirinciiial minim? camp of Silver Canyon with water, the natural supply of nhich is scarce. The prospects are brighter than ever, and it is to be hoped its patient prospectors will jet re ceive their reward. " Eboai-ino bt the Skin op the Teeth.
