PRESIDENT'S LAST MESSAGE ANNUAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS ARE MADE BY , ROOSEVELT. Sherman Law Should Be Amended. Favors Postal Savings Banks and Parcel Post. Washington, Dec. follow ing is a brief synopsis of the Presi dent's message, read to the two Houses today: The financial standing of the na tion at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the nation's Interests by the government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our currency system is imperfect and it is earnestly to be'hoped that the currency commission will b».- able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the exist ing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to Sept. SO, 1908, there has been a net surplus of hundred millions of receipts over ex penditures, a reduction the inter est bearing debt by ninety millions, In spite of the extraordinary expense of the Panama canal and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual Interest charge. Corporations—l believe that un der the interstate clause of the con stitution the United States has com plete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and I believe that the national gov ernment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from and to do justice to the great corpora tions which are the most important factors in modern business. I be lieve that it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman anti-tru3t law, because such a law can be en forced only imperfectly and unequal ly, and Its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. The railways of the country should be put completely under the inter state commerce commission and re moved from the domain of the anti trust law. Telegraph and telephone com panies engaged in interstate business should be pat under the jurisdiction of the Interstate commerce commis sion. Labor—As far as possible I hope to see a frank recognition of the advantages conferred by machinery, organisation and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger share in the owner ship by wageworker of railway, mill and factory. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of tak ing care of the wageworkers who, under our present Industrial system, become killed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular incidents'of a given business. The object sought could be achieved by proper employ ers' liability laws. I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should be as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the en tire work being carried on by the government. The Courts—l most earnestly urge upon congress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our judges. Beginning with the supreme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled. It"is discreditable to us as a peo ple that there should be difficulty in convicting murderers or in bringing to justice men who as public ser vants have been guilty of corruption or who have profited by the corrup tion of public servants. Forests—lf there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our children and our children's children to perform at once it is to save the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most im portant element of the natural re sources of the country. Pure Food—The pure food legis lation has already worked a benefit difficult of estimation. Postal Savings Banks—l again re new my recomemndatlon for postal savings banks, for depositing sav ings with the security of the govern ment behind them. Parcel Post —The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and country storekeeper. Public Health—The dangers to public health from food adulteration ind from many other sources, such as the menace to the physical, men tal and moral development of chil dren from child labor, should be met itnd overcome. Statehood —I advocate the imme diate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of con gress. Porto Rico —1 again recommend that American citizenship be con ferred upon the people of Porto Rico. The Navy—l approve the recom mendations of the general board for the increase of the navy, calling es pecial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers and. above all. of the four battleships. It u desirable to complete as soon as U*£T wr s'T' ihi ps of the best existing type. HOB HMD 

BANK FIVE MEN HOLD UP PRESIDES* AND CASHIER AT DESK*J AND SECURE $14,743. Robbers Pnl Loot in Sacks and Mai 8 Their Escape in Two Minutes. No Clew Is Found. Portland, Or., Dec. 8. —Five un masked men held up and robbed the East Side Bank at 5:45 o'clock last night. Fourteen thousand dollars in gold, silver and currency was the plunder claimed by the robbers. This they gathered in two big sacks and ran out of the bank, staggering un der the weight of the loot. Just two minutes were required to complete a robbery that has few precedents for desperation and dar ing. Entering the bank, in the heart ol the East Side business district, at an hour when hundreds of people were on the streets, the leader and most determined of the five men, at pistol's point forced President New hall and his son, who is the cashier, to retire, their hands up, into Mr. Newhall's private office. This done two men who were waiting outside jumped inside the swinging door, and while one stood with a cocked revolver watching the entrance, the other held sacks into which the lead er dumped the money from the coun ter and cash till. The other two re mained as "look-outs" on the out side. and were prepared to throw the authorities off the scent in case they were driven to cover or discovered before making their get-away. Deputy Sheriff Frank Beatty found a package of the stolen money—- $200 In $5 gold piece—which the robbers had dropped in their flight. The leading spirit in the robbery, a man of 38, smooth shaved and wearing seedy clothes, took all the desperate chances and did the actual work of taking the money. Detectives and police are on tha case, but as yet have no clews. 

ROOT DENIES CHARGE Washington Bar Association to Sift Scandal to Bottom. Seattle, Wash., Dec. 7.—Breaking his silence for the first time since his resignation from the supreme court bench of the state of Wash ington, former Justice Milo A. Hoot stated that the troubles with which he has become involved and which led to his resignation, were brought about through trusting a friend whom he had known for 20 years or more. "But let me say first," said Mr. Root, "I am not corrupt. I d"d not receive a single penny. I did not aßk for a cent and. what has been done has been done honestly and above-board. I do not care to say that Judge Gordon took my letters to the Great Northern railway and capitalized them for any amount. All I know about that is what friends of mine have told me. "It is untrue that Judge Gordon wrote the decision in the Harris vs. Great Northern decision, which has been attributed to him," declared Judge Root. Members of the special bar com mittee are determined to report fully on the exact facts on every charge they can hear. There is no chance of a whitewash report, and the bar committee's findings may be even more drastic than have been inti mated thus far.
