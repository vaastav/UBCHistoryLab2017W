He stated that the rooms had been rearranged and that a number of new improvements were under way. A full report later. He gave it as his opin ion that a good deal might be saved by buying new books in preference to hav ing oid ones rebound in a good many cases. It was then moved that a number of books that were at the present time in bad condition should be sent to the dif ferent schools which are maintaining li braries at the present time. The mo tion carried. The committee on finance then reported the bills that they had O. K"d. and they were accepted by the board and ordered paid. The total amount of expenditures or the month were $3,7(2.81. Principal Knight then made his report which vf as accepted. He said in part: The total enrollment of boys was 2,161; of girls 2,402: total, 4.862. making a total gain over last year at the same period of 226. The average attendance of the boys is 1.891 ; of the girls. 2.1S7.3. The Fairmount school takes the first place in the rank of promptness, Washington second. In the matter of attendance Fairmount and Washington stand first with a record of 97. High school, Franklin and Lincoln? second with a record of 95. Principal Knight stated that he had visited all of the schools four times during the month and had found the work satisfactory. It was then moved that steps be taken to have the children subscribe to the fund to erect a monument at McKlnley's home in Canton. Messrs, Rice, Jackman and Dr. Horner were appointed as members of the visiting board for the next three months, after which quite a discussion was started by Mr. Bell, who remarked that steps ought to be taken to prevent the display of goods that are being displayed daily on the sidewalks of the city. He cited the fact that a great many children when passing along the streets see these things and are tempted to take an apple or some other little thing that pleases them ano from this they are very apt to go to larger things of a more valuable nature. The last taing discussed was the ap pointment of a truant officer. By motion, however, it was agreed to ask the mayor to have the entire police force on the lookout for the children who are not in school and o see why they are not in school. There are some parents in this city who ought to be prosecuted on the ground that they do not send their chil dren to school and it Would be a good thing to do so was the sentiment of the board. After some further discussion on the matter the meeting adjourned. Purify the sewers of the body and stim ulate the digestive organs to maintain health, strength and energy. Prickly Ash Bitters is a tonic for the kidneys, liver, stomach and bowels. 

WICHITA PET STOCK SHOW. Annual Exhibition to Be Held Here next Week. The third annual exhibition of fancy pet stock is to be held In this city the second week in December and it promises to be the largest exhibition of its kind held this year west of Chicago and the biggest show ever held In Wichita. Last year's show was a big success and was visited by thousands of people who were more than pleased with the highly enter taining exhibit. The show Is given under the auspices of the Arkansas valley Pigeon Fanciers' Association, composed of Wichita and Kansas pet stock fanciers. The management will be under the per sonal supervision of Mr. Charles Payne, who has made the show business a study and It is not necessary to say that lie will put the enthusiasm in this to make it a howling success. The secretary has ' already leceived entries of pets from ' some of the largest cities in the west, j Oit Society of Chicago has taken a deep interest In this exhibition and some ' of? the .finest cats from the ast are fix' I iMx-tedihere. Sultdre.'Y.the great Persian ' cat from New Jersey is to be here and he is considered one of the swellest cats in cat society. He is a large black cat with white points. Golden eyes and a wry large bushy tail. This cat has won laurels wherever shown. Among the swellest soei-ty in the east "Augora cats" are very fashionable and at all the pet j .stock shews the society people take their cats to the show, and it is expected that i ono Udy from Chicago will send more than a dozen different varieties to mis exhibition. Small dogs, that aro termed by the fanciers "Toy Specimens" will also be here and one man has said that he would send a tine specimen imported from Eng land that is valued at a $L0a. 'Ament in Bgle" the carrier pigeon that brought the first message to Ameri can soil, of the victory won at Santiago, during the Spanish-American war, is also expecte d to bo here. The managers have asked the owners to shew him and they have consented to do so. There will also be an exhibition of over ion different varieties of birds from Cuba, Germany. China. England and America, taking in all size's from the Cuban v ren to the African Parrot. Mr. Carl Franz, ' of Milwaukee. Wis., win De nere mm j forty Parlor Tumbler pigeons and give an exhibition every afternoon in the show room. These tumblers possess wings the same as any other bird, but are consti ! tuted bv careful breeding so that they have no use of them. They perform by jumping up in the air about two or three feet and turn over and over like an acro bat. Mr. Franz thoroughly understands the nature of this variety of pigeon and will explain why they cannot fly. Mr. Lane, foimeny o hi Collection Of England, win exniou fancy rats and mice. harnessed ana nueneu uj w m I waeon which they araw iiKe a spjui oi horses, fms will be a great curiosity that is worth going miles to see. There will be an exhibit of taxidermy and curies that have never been seen in th west before. Mr. Walter Jones will have on exhl tion his collection of bird's eggs which number over W and there are among them some very rare specimens. Here is a chance for every Wichita person who has a pet to show them and it should be done, as it is almost entirely gotten up by Wichita fanciers. Mr. !. E. Ward, the superintendent of the show, will gladly give any information to those who would like to show their pets. He can be seen at HO North Emporia avenue any day during the week.

FOB ROUS REEHTS Mr. Howard Teiis of Fight for Better Rates, HMP FROM ROOSEVELT Power for Interstate Com merce Commission, Mr. J. E. Howard of the Union Mills company has returned from Washington, where he attended "The Reciprocity Con vention" held there. He is not greatly impressed with the work done at at convention, as the high tariff element in vaded it in great numbers, and hence prevented an open and positive declara tion for reciprocal trade relations with other countries. But he is feeling good over the prospects of congress passing amendments to the inter-state commerce law which will give the inter-state com mission the power to enforce any order they may choose to make. Mr. Howard is enthusiasticlly in favor of the measure, and is using his utmost influence -to have its passage accom plished. He thinks the Santa Fe favors an amendment such as is proposed, but It Is possible that it does so only on the condition that a bill shall also be passed legalizing pooling among common carri ers. It is said that the railroads contend that if pooling is made legitimate there will be no necessity for discrimination. The Millers association is divided on this question, many of tbe members being un compromisingly opposed to "pooling," regardless of its effects. Mr. Howard is secretary of the commit tee having in charge the campaign in fa vor of giving the inter-Etate commerce commission power commensurate with its responsibility, and he believes that it is important that all shippers, regardless of their business, should become Interested in the matter, and make their will felt in Washington. The millers want something that is to the benefit of every citizen and of every industry except, possibly, the railroads. They are opposed to the discrimination of the railways in favor of wheat against flour. In other words, they want Ameri can wheat made into American flour and the manufactured product sent to Europe for sale. As conditions now exist the railroads, with their steamboat connec tions, want the raw material taken from the wheat fields to Europe that .they may get that much more tonnage, Mr. How ard,, and others, think that the American railways are mistaken in their policy in this respect; that it would be eventually better for the railroads to have food products made at home, by American millers American machinery and Ameri can coal. He cannot see how it can profit the railroads to have Sedgwick county wheat made Into flour in France and shipped to England. They do not haul the coal that makes that flour, as they could do if it was made here In Wichita. If the manufacture of Kansas wheat builds up a town in France, with in creased population and Increased pros perity, the railroads do not benefit by It; whereas they would, by encouraging the manufacture of flour at home, build up Wichita, giving it more population and prosperity, they would benefit their own business permanently. The bill proposed by the millers Is to give a friendly inter-state commission the right to order, if they deem proper, that the railroads should at once cease dis criminating in favor of wheat and against flour, and to give them the power to enforce that or any other order when it is made. Mr. Howard, while ho had not then read Fresldent Roosevelt's message, felt confi dent that ho would prove friendly to the proposition to clothe the commission with more authority, and his coiJdenco has been justified by the president's message. A coated tongue, foul breath and clogged condition in the bowels suggests tho use of Prickly Ash Bitters. It is just suited for such ailments. 

WICHITA COURSING MEET All About the Great Sport Lately In troduced. Many peoplo havo been waiting for the announcement of the coursing meet to be held at Wichita, soon. -Tew people know what a coursing meet really is. Some think it is a Jack-rabbit race: others suppose that all tho dogs run at once. To begin with a coursing meet is one .of the most refined kind of sport known to exist, and is followed by the most refined ladies and gentlemen of the decade or two ago, with what had scarely present day. Starting for the first but a more than a local interest, and with no perstige in this country to appeal to. there were to be faced the doubts and scoffs of the skeptical who predicted that the attempt to Introduce the sport would be entirely futile. Others suspicious and arrayed against a new thing also pessi mists and sore-heads, forever seeing only shadows and gloom, while at the same time even advance carried with it the difficulty of being on new and untried territory and with a large amount of failure sttra to be realised. Overcoming all these things, pushing steadily to the froat the development has been without parallel, taking on a national and even mtematioaal importance. For surpass ing tbe horse cr tho circus in the clean and manly way It is conduc ted, what can be more exciting, mors exbilirattng than a cloeely contested race between two hounds, bred, raised, and conditioned until erary muscle and curve is the very picture of grace. Each exerting every particle Of strength asd cunning to out wit his opponent to capture the little monarch of the prairie, known as the jackrabbit. In coursing, there is no delay no scoring or waiting. The dogs run tw o at n time anfi very means of escape is afforded to the rabbit, the race course being entirely surrounded by a high fenc of a burlap, inside of which the rabbits are kept and trained to lind the t stupes which the dogs know nothing about. The grounds are usually a quarter of a mile in diameter from every point. A ltirge anipl theatre being built to accommodate the spectators affords a fine view of every race, which axe ran one after another the entirs day, and usually taking about three days t each mctt. All this taks money to carry it on suc cessfully, which must le raised in ad vance, returning again with the entrance fee of ths dogs an the gate receipts, which in a town like Wichita, ought and would be . a day a twenty-rive cents apiece. Tb does aJoce are worth twice tbe smontt of admission to see. being the best from every stats in the Union, also England and Ireland. How many have seen a dog whose actual value was from $2.eJ to S.Wt Is not a dog like th.t worth seeing? Every other t" l ;n t". state is holding cvursdrtg me. : io three times a year. Even Nebraska ran a coat wing meet, giving a purse of K . and are rP ri for another.
