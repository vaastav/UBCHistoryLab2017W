ISews from Washington on the best authority says: "When the President formally in vited his cabinet to remain with him another term, he meant something more. Office holders, great and small, who are giving satisfaction in the dis charge of their duties, are practically included in the invitation to stay. There are to be no removals except for good cause. The only changes and appointments which will occur will be those due to vacancies on ac count of death or voluntary resigna tion. Authority for this statement comes from the White House. The President's policy regarding patron age was announced explicitly and definitely in response to an inquiry made respecting it. Efficient officials holding commissions for stated terms will be reappointed. Those who are serving without fixed tenure will con tinue without interruption by the transition of the administration from first to second term. This statement applies not alone to government officials in Washington. It will be the policy to continue postmasters, col lectors, district attorneys, marshals and other federal officers through the next term." This insures the reappointment of Collector Z. 3F. Mansur in the Mem phremagog District, Olin Merrill in the Vermont district, District Attor ney, J. L. Martin, and Marsnall, F. A. Field, and is just as it should be. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinley sent his annual message to congress last Monday. The message opens with a brief survey of the growing strength and increasing power for good of republican institutions and Amer ican liberty at the outgoing of the old and the incoming of the new century. The Chinese problem is made the dominant question in our foreign intercourse and an elaborate review is made of the details of military operations and diplomatic steps j taken in the progress of the settlement up to the present time, and which have been made known to the public by official announcements m the past. As then said, "The policy of the govern ment of the United States.is to seek a solu tion which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, pro tect all rights guaranteed to friendly pow ers by treaty and international law and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire." Faithful to those professions which, as it proved, reflected the views and purposes of the other co-operating governments, all our efforts have been directed toward end ing the anomalous situation in China by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our legation and its de pendents was accomplished we withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in Peking as a channel of negotiation and settlement, a course adopted by others of the interested powers. Overtures of the empowered rep resentatives of the Chinese emperor have been considerately entertained. Touching upon the possible inability of China to pay a sufficient money indemnity the president says : "I am disposed to think that due com pensation may be made in part by increas ed guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities, and, most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerce of all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our representatives." In the event of protracted divergency of views in the negotiations the president favorably inclines to Russia's suggestion that the matter of indemnities be relegated to the court of arbitration at The Hague. In touching upon the Paris Exposition the message devotes a congratulatory par agraph to the United States exhibits, in being not only the largest foreign display, but among the earliest in place and best arranged and more completely covering the entire classifications than that of any other nation, ranking next in total number after those of France itself. The awarding of a larger number of prizes to American exhibitors than those of any other nation is accepted as a striking recognition of the merits of the exhibits. Uncertainty is Jexpressed as to the pros- j pect of our well nigh extinguished German ' trade under the new burden of'the meat inspection law and the confident hope is expressed that further regulations will be free from past discriminations. The speedy and complete establishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the Russo-American treaty for the cession of Alaska is recommended in view of the possibility of friction in the work ing of the modus xivendi. Taking the lynching of Italians at Tallu lah as as a text, the president renews rec ommendations that federal courts have jurisdiction in international cases where the ultimate responsibilsty of the federal government may be involved. The presi dent advises in conclusion that congress make gracious provisions for indemnity to these Italian sufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore. Satisfaction is expressed at formal noti fication of the ratification of The Hague treaty by the United States, Austria, Bel gium, Denmark, England, France, Ger many, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden and Norway, and The Netherlands. Japan is added to the list. Regarding the Nicaraguan Canal, the information is given that the Nicaraguan government shows a disposition to take measures to promote the water way, after having declared the so-styled Eyro-Cragian option void. The report of the commis sion, it is recommended, may be awaited. The convention with Great Britain to re move any objections which might arise out of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty to the con struction of the canal is commended to the early attention of the senate. Turkish relations are dismissed with the assertion that "We await the fulfillment of the promise of the Sultan to make repar ation for the injuries suffered by the American citizens in Armenia and else where in the Turkish empire." The recommendation is made that the senate take action on the commercial con ventions submitted at the last session looking to the operation of a policy of reciprocity. The exposition of the resources and products of the western hemisphere to be held at Buffalo next year promises impor tant results not only for the United States, but for the other participating countries. It i3 gratifying that the Latin-American states have evinced the liveliest interest, and the fact that an international Ameri can congress will be held in the city of Mexico while the'exposition is in progress encourages the hope of a larger display at Buffalo than might otherwise be practica ble. The work of preparing an exhibit of our national resources is making satisfac tory progress under the direction of differ ent officials of the federal government, and the various states of the Union have shown a disposition toward the most liberal par ticipation in the enterprize. It is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1900, were ?79,527,060.1S. For the six preceding years we had only deficits, the aggregate of which from 1894 to 1899, inclusive, amounted to 283,022,991. It is gratifying also to note that during the year a considerable reduction is shown in the expenditures of the government. It will be the duty, as I am sure it will be the jisp0sition of the congress," says the president, "to provide whatever further legislation is needed to insure the contin ued parity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money, silver and geld." Touching the disposition of the surplus the president recommends a reduction of internal revenue war taxes in the sum of 539,000,000. "This reduction should be secured by the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the most burdensome to the industries of the people." The inclusion in the reduc tion is specially urged of the legacy tax bequests for public uses of a literary, edu cational or charitable character. The beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900, so far as it relates to a modification of the national banking act, is already apparent. The provision for the incorpo ration of national banks with a capital of not less than 25,0002in places not exceed ing 3,000 inhabitants, has resulted in the extension of banking facilities to many small communities hitherto unable to pro vide themselves with banking institutions under the. national system. There were organized from the enactment of the law up to and including Nov. 30, 369 national banks, of which 266 were with capital less than 50,000 and 103 with capital of $50,000 or more. Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and .industrial prog ress. The total of imports and exports for the first time in the history of the country exceeded 2,000,000,000. Immediate action is urged on measures to promote American shipping and foreign trade. American vessels during the past three years have carried about 9 per cent, of our exports and imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, not the greatest part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steel industries, the progress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade and our steadily maintained expenditures for the navy have created an opportunity to place the United States in the first rank of commercial maratime powers. The president calls attention to the passage in his last annual message for early action to remedy such evils as might be found in to exist in connection with com binations of capital organized into trusts, and he repeats the language of the previous message, adding: "Restraint upon such combinations as are injurious, and which are within federal jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the congress."
