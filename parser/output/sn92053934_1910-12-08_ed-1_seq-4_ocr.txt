That Ballinger whitewash was rubbed on too thick to be healthy or comfortable. The undertone of President Taft's message seemed to indicate a hope less submission to the inevitable the failure of his administration and a purpose to make the best of it by a do-nothing policy that would make things' no worse than they are, from the president's viewpoint. Now comes word from Washington to the effect that the president's own party is on the brink of destruction with the old guard determined to stand pat and the insurgents equally bent i on forcing action. The first clash is ! prcm.sea wnea tne supreme court : appointments are presented. Sympathy for Congressman McKin ncy. From all over the Fourteenth ccn gressional district expressions of grief and sympathy will pour in upon ; Congressman McKinney in the Jess j of his beloved wife. If there is any I consolation that can come in such : a dark hour, the tributes that are ; paid by those who knew Mrs. Mc-i Kinney for so many years and the ! memory which must be dear to her husband's heart, will be as a light in the shadow of the valley through which he is passing.

An cnormotin sum of money is be- j ing expended by the national gov - i ernment in pushing to successful ' completion that dream of a century . the Panama esnal. and two of our greatest, itifs are struggling for the honor c? folebrat ir.g that achiov.- ment with a great world's exposition, to which all nations may be invited rnd th? products of the earth exhib ited. Each of these ctties has pledged millions of mont; for the r-uccessful i roduction of a celebration in which a!! nations are to be invited to par ticipate, yet when we come to ex hibit, the greatest fundamental ne cessity of any sire or n;;t:on the public highways, we make the poor est showing, tho most ridiculously wretched exhibition of any civilized country in the world, a condition that is viewed with nraszemeTH by all foreigners and endured by our own people with a patience which is a serious reflection upon their good sense. It is surely a matter of tremendous import that in thi Unit ed States bad road3 are responsible for the loss of a billion dollars a year, and -the saving of this stupen dous sum surely constitutes an econ omic question of vast importance. In a communication just sent out to the press, Arthur C. Jackson, president of the National Good ; 1 1 Roads association, says: I "Soon both New Orleans and Sanl Francisco will appear before con-j press in vigorous if not bitter rivalry j for the privilege of holding the Pan- ana exposition, and each will pre- j Bent a multttuae oi attractions, ana advantages which no one can ques tion.

German Boys' Work Problem-When- an American boy leaves schooj he does not always know what sort of work he wants or which he is fit for. Or even when he knows exactly what kind of a job he desires, he often does not know at all how to find it. Such a job as he aims for may not exist within his oppor tunities of place and time. So the boy. leaving school, may drifc into an un suitable occupation, or worse, into no occupation at all. in spite of an honest wish, originally, to work. In Germany they order these things better, the Detroit 'Free Press says. That admirable study of "The German Workman," the work of the Munich labor bureau for boys leaving school is recorded. Munich teachers became interested in finding suitable work for their boys in 1906, and now the bureau, with their help, for its construction, and while the - ' "y - V exposition would last but for a sea- Increasing initiative referendum son. the highway would endure asjan(1 recall powers, restricting legis long as the canal itself, and whati""6 f of emersency proviso, pro more splendid contribution could our V1 for proportional representa- has grappled with the- question more successfully. Every year printed schedules of comprehensive questions are sent to every head teacher of the Munich schools to be distributed among the pupils who are going to leave the schools that year. The pupils are asked to put them selves in communication with the municipal labor bureau, which will advise them as to the choice of a vocation and give them the best chance possible to secure work. Yearly circulars are also sent to all the trade guilds and other labor societies, to enlist their coopera tion. The children respond readily to the aid given them. Boys come by dozens to the office of the bureau In search of positions as appren tice or beginner. Each 'brings a form of application, filled up by him self but signed by his teacher. When the bureau finds a place for him he is notified by a post card and he presents himself foe examination by the employer wherever and when ever the latter may appoint. Whether the boy takes the job or not, he must report to the bureau the result of the Interview; and this goes on until work is procured which suits him and which he is able to do. For the direction of the boys the labor bureau is prepared, with the aid of expert employers and medi cal men, a handsome book of indus tries open to the boy. This hand book describes the different kinds of work, the qualifications necesr. sary to each, the prospects of pro motion or steady employment, the health conditions, the dangers and difficulties, the cost and time of mining nnri ovrvthln eis which the boy and his parents ought to know before choosing his career. ! Initiative anil Referendum in Oregon. Thirty two questions involving matters of public policy were sub imitts.l to a referendum voted in Ore- j gon at the recent election. It was ; objected in advance of their submis- J i sion, by the foes of popular govern-i rnent. that it was folly to expect the voters to pass intelligently on all the ; ! questions submitted, but the result j I justifies the faith of those who be- j , lieve that the people are fully as j well qualified to pass on matters af fecting their own affairs as their del- : egated representatives would be, and ranch better. j To assist the voter to ajudgement i of the questions there was furnished j him a pamphlet containing each of j the nronosif ions, and an arcument bv tho ablest opponent of each prop- ,' OS5;tjon. The proposal before him. i qnd arguments for and against it tnfre for nis perusal, the voter en-' ab!od to SP& 5t in all .? phases and: ,icci(ie whether he was for or against; its incorporation into law.
