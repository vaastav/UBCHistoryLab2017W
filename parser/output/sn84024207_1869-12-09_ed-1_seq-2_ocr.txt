Although your efforts have not met with tho success in oil particulars that might lis to been desired, yet, on tlio wholo, tbey have been mora successful than could havo been reasonably ' anticipated.- Sewn fstatea which pussed ordinatcos iA soeetsjon have been fully restored to .tlneir places In the Union. ; The eighth, Georgia, held an election, at which she ratified her , Constitution, Rcpnblicnn in form, 'elected a Governor,- members of -Congress, a Stato Legislature, and all othor officers jequirod.

The okctions have taken" tlat; but the reWft is not known. It is to be hoped that the acta of tho Legislatures of these States, when tbey meet, will be such as to receive your approval and thus close the work of recon struction. ... . . f r , Abjong tbo evils growing out of the rebellion, and not yet roforrod to; is that of an irredeemable cur rency . It is an evil wbicb I hope will receive your most earnest at tention It is a ' duty, ' and one of the highest. duties of , Government,, to securo to its citizens a medium of exchange of fixed, unvarying value. ' This implies a return to a specio'basis, and no substituto for it can be devised. It should be commenced now, and reached at tbo earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interest of 'tho debtor cIurs. Im mediate resumption, if practicable, would not ue desirable It would compel the debtor class to pay be yond their contracts the premium on gold at the dato of thoir pur chase and would brins bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. , Fluctua tions, however, in the paper value of the rdcasaro of all values gold is detrimental, to the inter est of trade. ' It makes tho .man of business an involuntary gamblor., for in . all sales whore future pay mcnt is to bo made, both parties sriecuiatdos to what will be the val uq of the curroncy to be paid and received. I I ourncsily recommend to yoq, then; such legislation as1 will in sure a gradual return to specie payments, and put an immediate stop to fluctuations in thoevnlne of currency. Tho methods to secure these results are as numerous as are tbo speculations on political ccon omy, ,To secure tho former 1 see but ono way. apd that is to author i?rtho Treasury to redeem its own paper at it' fixed prico whonevcr presented; to withhold from circu iaiioii all such currency redeemed until sold again for gold. The vast rosourccs otlhe nation, both devel oped and undeveloped, ought to muko cur credit tbu best on earth. With less burden of taxation than the citizon has-endured for six years past, tbo entire public debt could bo paid in ton years; but it is not dosirablo that tbo poo plo Bhould bo tuxod to pay it in that timo. Year by year, tho abil ity to pay inoroasos in a rapid ra tio; but tho bunion of interest ought to bo reduocd as rapidly ns can bo dono without tho violation oi contract, i uo puono uudi is represented, in great part, by bonds, having from five lo twenty and irom ton to loriy years to run, ouiinntf interest at me rato ot six per cunt, and five per cent, respec ively, It is optional with the Gov ernment to pay its bonds at any period alter tbo expiration of tho last timo mentioned npon . their futo. Tho time hts already cx pii?U whon a groat) part of them nny be Iskon up; aod the timo is rapidly upprouching when ull mny bo. . : i ., It fa holit-ved (list all which are now duo may bo rep.'ncod by bonds bonring a rate of interest not ex ceeding four and a half per cent, and as rapidly- as tho retnufodor becomes duo that they may be i'l placed in tho same way. . To ac complish this it may be neoossary to authorize tho interest to bo paid ut either of the tbrco or four of the mouoy centors of Europe, or by any Assistant Treasurer of tho United States, at tho option of the holder of tho bond. -1 suggest this subject for tho consideration of Congress; alno, simultaneously with this, tho propriuty of redoeming our curronay ns butoro suggested, at its market valae, at the time tho law goes into effect, increasing tho rato at which currency will be bought and sold from day to day or week to wtek, at tho sumo rato of intorest as tho Govornmcnt pays upon bonds; j Thoruhjoct of tariff and internal taxation will neooHsnrily receive your attention. The rovouues of the country aro greater than the requirements, nnd may with safety be reduced; but as tbe funding of tho debt in a fouror n four and a half per cent, loan would reduco tho an nuul current oxpenso largely, thus, ullcr funding, justifying a greater reduction of taxation than would ho now expedient. I sugstost tho postponement of this question un til tho next mooting ut Congress. It may be Advisable to modify tax ation and tho tariff in instances whero unjust or burdunsomo dis criminations are mado by tho pro- sent laws; but a general rovision of the laws regulat ng thisiuhjoct I recommend the postponomont of fur tho present. I also suggest thfe renewal of tho tax on incoinos, but at a roduuod rate say thrco per cent., and this tax lo oxpiro in three years. With tho funding of tho nation al (tabt, as suggested, I feel salo in saying that tbo taxes and rovenuo from imports mny reduced sixty to eighty millions por annum at once, and sUll further roduood from year to year as the resources of tho country aro dovelopod. Tho report of tho Secretary of the 'Ireasury shows tho receipts of tho Oovorfiment for the fUcal vear 490,597. Vive estimates for tho on suing year are moro favorable to the Govornmoat,nd will, doubt, how S largo decrease efjHiblic debt. The receipts in tho Treasury be yond expenditures, havo exceoded the amount necessary to place to the credit 01 tno sinking (und, as provided by law. To lock np tho surplus in tho Treasury and with hold it from circulation, would lead lo such contraction of eurroney as to cripple trade aid seriously affeot the prosperity of ouroonntry. Ua der these oirenmetances tho Secre tary and myself .heartily concur red In tbe propriety oft nting. all the sarplas Currency in the Treses ury in ths purchaso of Govorn mcnt bonds, thus reducing tho in- terest-bearing debt of the" 'coun ter, an d of submitting to Congiess kbquetit of y the. disposition to bo mode ot me oonao ou puruaBu, The bonds now" bold by tbe Trea sury ABOunt U ftbont 573.00000, including tboso belonging to the Sinking Fond. I recommend that tho whole be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund. Your attention is respocttuiiy lu rked to tbe recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury for (tbe creation of Commissioner of'cusv tome revenuo, for tbo Increase ol salarv to certain classes of ofBoials, and the substitution of art increas ed .National bank circulation to ro- Dlaca the outstanding 3 por. cont. certificates; and most especially to his recommendation lor tne repoai of laws allowing shares of fines, ponalties, forfeitures, etc., to offi cers of the Government or to in formers. , The i office of Commissioner or Internal .Revenue is ono of the most arduous and resnonsiblo on- Hr th Government. It falls but littlo, if any, short ol a Cabinet po s t on in its importance ana re sponsibilities. 1 would ask for it. tlmrnfore. such legislation as in your judgment will place the office on a footing of dignity' common- surote with "its importance, . anu wilb a character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it rronorlv.

I ... -Iif " crnment; dui wnno bo ivrnunmii. ing, it Is duo to our honor that wo should abstain from enforcing our vinwA ftnnn nnwilliDff cations, and from tikinc an Interested part without invitation in the quarrels between different nations or be twoon irovcrnmonts or their sub jeets. Our courso should always be in conformity with strict justice and law, international .and local. Such has been tho policy of tho ad ministration in doaling with these questions. For moro than a year u valuablo provinco of Spain, and a near neighbor of onrs. in whom ull onr poople cannot but fool s dcop interest, has boon struggling for inienor.aenco nnu nuuuuiu. Tho poople nnd government ot tne United States entertain tno same warm feelings and sympathies lor tho people of tuba in tneir strug ulo that thev manifested through out the previous struggles between Spain and her former colonies in behair ol tno latter, dui iuu eon test ot no timo assnmod tho condi lions which amount to a war in thesonsoof International law, or which would show tho existence of a de facto political organization of tho insurgontssufflclsnt to justify a reoocnitron of belligerency. The Drinciplo Is maintained, 'however, that this nation is its own judge when to accord tho rights of belligordn cy, either to a pooplo Straggling to froo themselves from a govern. mont they believo to bo oppressive, or to independent nations nt war with oaoh other. Tho . United Statos havo Bo disposition to inter fere with tho existing relations of Spain to ber colonial possessions on this tontinont; they boliovo that in duo time Spain, and other European powers, will find thoir interest in terminating thoBe rela tions and establishing their pres ent dependencies as independent powors mombors of tbe family of of nations. Tbcso oeponaonoies aro Jo longer regarded as subjoct to transfur from ono Europoan power to another. Whon the present rotations of thoso colonies coaso they uro to becomo Indepen dent powers, exercising thought ofchoioonnd sblfcontrol In the determination ofth.Tir fntnro con dition and relations with othor powors, Tbo Unitod Stales. Jn order to put a stop to bloodshed Cuba und in the interest of n neighbor ing pooplo iroposed their good of fices to bring tho oxistinc contest to a torrainalion. Tho ofTor not being acqeptud by Spain on a basis which we boliovod oould bo recoiv. od by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped that tho good offices ol tho Unitod Stales may yet prove ad- vantogoous for tho sottlumont of this unhappy strifu. Mcanwhiloa number ot illegal expodiiions a gainst Cuba havo boon b rot on up U has been tlio cnaoavor of the Ad ministration to oxueuto tho neu trality laws in good faith, no mat tor how unplousunl tho task, made so by tho suffering wo havo endur ed from luck of liko good faith to- ward i:s by other nations, lho Unitod Statos schooner Lizzie Ma jor was arrostod on lho high sons by a Spanish trigute, ana two pas sengers tan on irom iter anu car ried as prisoners to Cuba, llepre sontations of those fucts wcro mado to tbo Spanish Government as soon as olllclal iniorinutioa 01 loom reachod Washington. The two paisongors were set at liberty, nnd lho Spanish Govornmont assured the Unitod States that tho Captain of tho frigalo. in making the cap ture, had noted without law; that ho had boon reprimanded for tho irregularity of bis conduct, and that lho Spanish authorities in Cu ba wjuld not sanotion any not that could violnto the rights or treat with disrespect tho sovoroignly of this nation. Tho quostlon of tho scizuro of tho brig Mary Lowell nt ono of tho Bahama Islands, by tho Spanish authorities, is now tho subject of oorrospondonco botweon this Gov ornmont and tboso of Spain and Great Britain. Tho Captain Gen oral ot Cuba, about May last, is sued a proclamation authorizing searob to bo made of vossols on lho high sons. Immediate roiuonstranco was mado against this, whereupon lho Cantoin Gonoral issuod a now proclamation limiting the right of soarch of vessels ot tno unitcu Stales so far as authorized nndor tho troatv of 1795. This procla mation, however, was iramodiatoly withdrawn. I have alwavs felt that tbo most intimate relations should be culti vated betwoon lho Ropublio of the IJiiitoa Mates and all independ ent nations on this continent. ' It may bo woli worth considering whether new treaties between the United States and them may not be profitably enterea into to seoare more intimate relations; friendly. commercial and otherwise. The subject of a canal; to connect tbo A t lani!a anI P11 rrfirt ' Otaa nai " V the Isthmus of Darien. is one in which commerce is greatly inter ested. Instructions have boen giv en to our Minister to the Republic of the United States of Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority for a urvey by this. Government in ordor to determine tho practicabil ity of such an undertaking, and a charter tor the right of way to build, by private enterprise, such a work, il the survey proves it to be prac ticable. f ' " 1.. In order to ' comply with the agreement bf the United States as to a mixed commission at Lima for the adjustment of claims, It be- came necessary to send a Commis sioner and Secretary to Lima in August last Ho appropriation having been made by Congress for this purpose it is now asked mat one bo made covering tbe past aod futnre expenses of tbe Commission.

A erant Las beon given to Euro peans of an exclusive right of tran sit over tho Territory of 'Nicara gua, to which Costa Rica has giv en its assent, which, it is allegod, conflicts with vested rights of citi zens of tbe United Statos. Tbo Department ot State has now this Subject undor consideration. Tho Minister of Pern, having made representations that there was a Btato of war botwoon Peru and Spain, amd that Spain was con structing In and near Now York thirty gunboats, which might bo used by Spain in sucb a way as to rolicvo lho naval force at Cuba, so as lo oporato against Peru, orders woro given to prtfvent thoir depar ture No further steps having boon takon by the representative of tho Peruvian Government to provent tho departure of these vessels, nnd I not feeling authoriz ed to rotain tho property of a na tion with which we aro at peace, on a mere Executive order, tho mat ter has been roforred to tbo courts to decide. Tho conduct of tho war betwoon tho Allies nnd Republic of Para guay has mado the intorcoorBO with that country so difficult that it has boon doomed advisablo to with draw our representative frcm thoro. Toward tbe closo of the last ad ministration a convention was signed nt London for the close of all outstanding claims between Great Britain and tho United States, which failed to receive tho advice and consent of tho Sonato to its ' ratification. Tbo timo and circumstances attending tho nego tiation of tho treaty woro favora ble to Its acceptanco by tho people of tho United States, but its pro visions wore wholly Inadequate for 'ho sottlemont of the grave wrongs that had boon sustained by the govornmcnt as Well as by Its citi zoos. ' The Injuries rosulling to tho Unitod States by roason of the courso adopted by Groat Britain daring our lato civil war, in the increased rates of insurnnco, in tbe diminution of exports and imports, and other obstructions to domestic Industry and production, in its el fed upon the foreign c6ramorco of tho country, in tho docroaso and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marino, in the pro longation of tho war, and increased cost both in treasure and in lifo, of its suppression, could not bo ad justed and satisfied ns ordinary commercial claims which continu ally ariso botwoon commercial na tions; and yet tho convention treated them simply as such ordi nary claims, from which ihoy dif fer more widely in tbe gravity of their charactor than in tho mugni tudo of thoir amount, great ovon as is that difference. JNot a word was found in that ticaly, and not an inforonco could bo drawn from it lo reruovo lho senso of the un friendliness of thi courso of Great Britain in our strugglo for exist ence' which had bo clocply and ir rosistibly improsscd itself upon tho pooplo of this country. Bolieving thai a convor.tion thus misconceived In its scopo and inad equate in its provisions, would not huvo produced tho hoarty, cordial sol'.lemcnt ol ponding questions which alone is consistent with the rotations which I desiro to havo established between tho Unitod States and Groat Britain, I regard ed tho action of the Sonnto in re jecting tho treaty to have been wisely trtKon in 100 interest 01 pence, nnd ns a nooossary step in lho direction ot a perfect and cor dial friendship between lho two countries. A sonsitlvo pooplo, con scions ot thoir powor, are more nt easo nndcr a grent wrong wnony unntonod; than undor tho restraint of a settlement which satisfies neith er thoir ideas of justice nor thoir grave sonse of tho grievances they havo sustainod.. lho rejoction ot tho treaty was followed by a state of publio fooling on both sidos, which I thought not favorable to an immodiato attempt nt renewal of negotiations, and I accordingly so instructed tbe Minister of tbe United Statos to Groat Britain, and found that my views in this regard wore shnrod by hor Majosty's Min isters. I hopo that tho timo may soon nrrivo when tho two govern ments can approach lho solution of this momentous quoslion with nn assurance oi what is duo to tho rights, dignity and honor of each, and with tho determination not only to romovo the causes of com- iilaint in tho past, but to lay the oundation of a broad principle of pnblio law which will prevent fn tnro differences and tend to firm and continued peace and friend ship.' This Is now tho only grave question which the United Slates have with any foreign nation. Tho qucstiou of a treaty for reci procity between tbe United States and tbe British provinces on this continent has not been favorably considered by the admlnistrationr Tbe advantage or each treaty would be wolly; in lavor of the British prod users' exeent eoseibly a few engaged in the trado between the two sections. No citizen of tbo United States would bo bepefitted by reciprocity. 1 Our ' internal tax ation would provo a protection to tbe British, producer almost equal to ther protection from tbo tariff. Somo arrangement, however," for tbe regulation ot commercial inter course between tbe United States and the dominioaof Canada may be desirable.! . . The commission for adjusting the claims of tho Hudson Bay & Pu- got a Sound Agricultural Co.. npon tho United States, has terminated its labors. The award of 8050,000 has been made, and all rights and titles Of the Company on the terri tory of the United Statos have been extinguished, and deeds for tbe property of the Company have boen received. An appropriation by Congress to meet this sum is asked. Tbe , Commuisioners for determining the North , Western land boundary, between tho Uni ted States and tbe British Posses sions, under tbo treaty of' 1856, have completed their lubors and the commission bas dissolved.-, In conformity with tho recom mendation of Congress, a proposi tion was recently made to' the British Government, to abolish the mixed courts creatod under tbe troaty of April 7th, 18C2, for the suppression ot the slave trade. The subject is still under negotia tion. It having como to my k no win edgo that a corporato company, organizod nnder British law, pro posed to land upon tbe shores of the United States, and to operate there a submarine cablo under a concession Irom bis Majesty, tno Emperor of tbo French, of nn ox. clusivo right for twenty yeuis ol tolegraphio . communication be tween tho shores of France and the United States, with lho very objoctionablo feature of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby to tho sovereignty and tho control of tho French Government, I caused the Kronen nnd British Legations at Washington to bo mado ac quainted with the probable policy of Congress on tho subject as foro shadowed by tho bill which pass ed tho Sonato in March last. This drew from tbe representatives of the Company an agreement to ac cept as tho basis of their opera tions tho provisions of tho bill, or of such other enactment on tho subjuc' as might be passed during the approaching scssi.in of Con gress; also to uso thoir influence to socure from the French Govern ment a modification ot thoir con cession so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cable be longing to any company incorpor ated by tho authority of tho Uni ted Stales, or of any State in tho Union, and on their part, not to opposo tho establishment of any suoh cablo. In consideration of this agroomontl dirocted lho with drnwul ot all opposition by the United Statos authorities to tho landing of lho cablo, and to the working of it until tho meeting of Congress. I rogrot to say that tboro has beon no modification made in tho company's concession, nor, so far as I can learn, have thoy nttompted to sooure ono. Thoir concession excludes tho cap ital and tbo citizens of the United States from competition upon the shoro of Franco. I rccommond legislation to protect tho rights of citizens of tho Unitod States, as woll ns tbo dignity and sovereign ty of the nation against such an assumption. I shall also endeavor to securo by negotiation nn nhnn. donmont of tho principlo of mon opolies in ocean telegraphing ca bles. Copies of this correspon dence aro horowith furnished. Tho unsottlcd political condition of. other countries, less fortunate than our own, sometimes in duces thoir citizens to como to tho Unitod Slates for tho solo pnrposo of becoming naturalized. Having socurod this, they return to thoir nntivo country und rcsido there without disclosing their charge of allegiance; thoy accept ofilcinl po sitions of trust or honor which can only bo held by citizens of thoir nntivo land; they journoy undor passports describing them ns such citizons, and it is only when civil discord, after a poriod of quiet, throatons thorn or their positions' or thoir property, or when their native Slates draft lb em into ill military service, that tho fact of their change ol atlcgimco is mndo known, 'ihoy resido pormanont ly from tho United Statos; they oontributo nothing lo its resources; thoy avoid tho duties of citizen ship, and they only mnko thorn, selves known by a claim of pro tection. . I havo directed diplomat io nnd consular officers of tho Uuit ed Stntcs lo scrutinize carefully all such claims ot protection. Tbe oitizon of lho United Stntcs, whoth or nativo or adopted, who dis charges his duty to bis country, is entitled to its oomploto protection. While 1 have a voice in lho direc tion of affairs, I shall not consent to impair tbo saorod right by con ferring it upon fictitious or fraudu lent claimants. On the accossion of lho prosont administration, it was found that tho Minjstor for North Germany had made preparations for lho negotiation ol a Convention for tho protection of emigrant passongors, to which no response had been given. It was conoludod that to be effootaal all tho maritime pow ers ongagod in tho . trade should join in ench a measure. Invita tions have been extended to tho Cabinet ol London, Paris, Florence Borlin, Brussels, tho Hague, Co penhagen and Stockholm, to em- nower their leprosontatives at Washington to simultaneously en ter into negotiations and to con clude with tbe United Statos, con ventions identioal in form, making uniiorm regulations as to the con struction ot tbo parts of vessols to be devoted to tbo uso of emigrant passengers; as to the quality and 1 quantity fiood; as to the medical tToatmenLof the sick, and as to tbe rules to be. observed during,. the voyage; in order to secure- ventUs- tion, to promote health, tq prevent fntrwaioa 'bd to protectxhe fe.-, males, ana providing tor tbo estab lishment of tribunals in tho spver al countries for enforcing such regulations by summary process. Your attontion is respectfully callod to the law regulating the tariff on Russian hemp, and to the question whothcr to fix the charges 00. Russian hemp higher than they are fixed .upon Manilla;'" is not a violation ot our troaty with Russia pfn3ing"J ber productions upon tbe same footing with thoso of tho most favored nations.)! 'iV'i Our raanofqeturos are increasing with wondortuf rapidity nndcr tho encouragomont which they now receive. With tho improvements in machinery already effected and still increasing, causing machinery, to take the place of skilled labor to a largo extont, our imports of many articles must fall off largely within a fo years. Fortunately, loo many manufactures are not con fined toll few localities as former ly, and it is to be hoped, they will become moro and moro diffused, making the intorest in thorn equal in' all sections.' Thoy givo omploy-t ment and support to hundreds of inousanus oi peopio at nome( bbu retain 'with ns tbo means wblch otherwise would bo shipped abroad. Tbo oxlension of railroads in Eu ropo and lho East is bringing into competition with our agricultural products like products . ef. other countries. . belt intorest, if not sell preservation, tbereforo, .dictates caution against disturbing any in dustrial iiitorcsts of tbe country. it teaches us, also, tbo ncnossity ol looking to 'Other markets for the sale of our surplus Our neighbors south of the United States, and China and J span should recoive our special, attention, it will be tbu endeavor of tbo administration to continue Buch relations with all these nations as to entitle tho Unit: ed Slates to their confidence and make it thoir interests us well as ours to establish better commercial relations. Through tho agoncy of a more enlightened policy than that heroloforo pursued toward China, largely due to tho sagacity and efforts of one of our own dis tinguishod citizens, tho world is about to commenco largely increas ed relations wilh that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As lho United States havo had tho in itiatory in tho now policy, so thoy should be tho most oarnest in show ing their good faith in making it a sueaess. In this connection I d- viso such legislation ns will forever prceludo tbo enslavement of lho Chincso upon our soil, undor tbe namo of Coolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in tbo transportation ol Coolies to any country tolornting tho system, and rocommend that the mission to China be raisod to one of the first class. . On my assuming the responsi bilities of Chief Mngistralo of tho United Statos, it wus with tbo con viction that throe things woro es sential to its poaco, prosperity and fullest development. First among thoso is striot integrity in fulfilling all our obligations, bocond, to so euro protection to tbe person and property of tho citizons ot our com mon country wherovor they may choose to move, without rolorcnoo to their original nativity, religion, color or politics, demanding ot them only obodionco to the laws and proper respect for the rights of others. Third, tho anion of nil the Slates with equal rights, inde struotiblo by any unconstitutional means. To socuro tho first of thoso, Con gress has taken twoessontiul stops. First, declaring by joint resolution that the public debt should bo paid, principal and interost, in coin. -Second, by providing moans for paying. Providing the means for paying, however, could not sooure tho nbjeel desired without a proper artmiiiixli-ution of the laws for Ihe collection of tho rovonuos aud an economical disbursement of them. To this subject tbo admin istration has most earnestly ad dressed itself, with results, I bo liovc, satisfactory. There has bton no hesitation in changing officials in order to secure tho execution ol tho Inws, somolimos, too, where, io a mero party viow, undesirable po litical results wcro likoly to fol low, nor any hesitation in sustain ing efficient oflioials against re monstrances wholly political. It mny bo woll to montion bore embarrassments possible to nrsio from leaving on the statuto books tbo so-callod Tonuro of Office Acts, and I earnestly rocommend their total repeal. It could not huvo been the intention of lho framers of tho Constitution, when provid ing that appointments mado by tho President should roceive the consont of lho Sonato, that tho lat ter should have tbo powor to ro tain in offleo persons placed there by federal appointments, against Hi 9 will of the President. The law is Inconsistent wilh a faithful and efficient administration of tho Government. Whet faith can tho Exocutlvo put in officials forced upon him? and thoso, too, whom he has suspended for roason. How will such officials be likoly tosorvo an administration whioh thoj know dares not trust them? For the second requisite to our growth and prosperity, timo and a firm but humane administration of existing laws, nmonded from timo to timo, ns they may provo ineffeo Vivo, or prove harsh and unneces sary, are probably all that are re quired. lho third cannot bo nttainod by epecial legislation, but must be re garded as fixed by tho Constitution itsolf, and gradually acquiesced in by forco of publio opinion from the foundation of tho Government to the presont. ' Tho mnnniromcnt of the original inhabitants of this continent the Indiana has been a subjoct of em harrassment and exponso, and has boen Attended wilb continuous robboriee, murders aod wars. From my own expoTionce npon the TrOn-j tiorandt Indian -countries, I uo not hold either; logiklalion or the oeoductof tee whites who come most in contact with the Indians blameless lor those hostilities. Tbe casW however." cannot be undone, and the question must bo met as we now find it. 1 have attempted a new policy toward these wards of the nation tbey cannot do regard ed in any othor light than as wards with fair rosults as far as tried, aod which, I hope will.be atlpRded, ultimately.. wltAicrjl BufcMss. Tbo sect of Frionds is well known ns baring" eoweeded living 4 poace with the Indians in tho ear ly settlement of Pennsylvania, while thoir while neighbors of oth er aocts, in other sections, wore conetantjy.. QmVU;dt ftyity are also known for their opposition to all etrifo, violonco and war, and aro gcnorwly HOted for thsi; strict in tegrity arid fair1 'dealings! Those considerations induced mo to give tho management of a low reservations of Indians to them and to throw tho burden of the, election of those ageintsnpon tho society i tef. Tifc result has proved most satisfacto ry. It will bo found more. fully set forth in tho report of tbe Com missioner of Indian Affairs. For Superintendents und Indian Agents, not on reservations, officers Lot;.Uio aptny. wcro selected,. Tbp reasons tor tuls. are joumerpuf When Indian Agents are sent thore,'1 or near there, troops must be sent also,!,. Tho' Agent sod Com mander of troops are independent of each other, and are subject to order from different departments of the Government.,, The army of ficer bolds a position for life, the agents aro at lho will of tho Presi dent. The former is personalty in terested in living in harmony with the Indians and in the establish ment of a permanent poaco, to tbe end that some portion of his life may bo spent within tho limits of a civilized soction.,, Tho latter Las no such personal interest. 'Anoth er reason is nn . ccohomio ono, and still another tho hold which thegov crnment has upon a life officer to securo a faithful discharge of du ties in carrying out its policy. The building of railroads and lho ac cess thereby given to all agricul tural and minora! regions of tbeir country is rapidly bringing civiliz od settlements into contnet with all tribes ot Indians. No matter what ought to be tho relations between such settlements nnd tbe aborig ines, tho fact Is they do not har monizo woll and ono or the other has to give way in tho end.
