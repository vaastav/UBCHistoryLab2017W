The Tom Reed has drifted into toe ore oooy on tne u o or twelfth level of that great mine and finds it as rich as on any of the other levels. The drift has been continued for several days in the ore. being carried six feet wide. How much wider the ore is has not been ascertained, but it is thought to be just as wide as in the level above, where about sixteen feet of ore was cut. Sheriff Wheeler and his bonds men, the United States Fidelity & Guarantee - company, have been made defendants in an ac tion in the superior court for damages in the sum of $1,000. The suit is entitled, Carmen Qui jada vs H. C. Wheeler as Sheriff etal, and was filed by S. K. Wil liams as attorney for the plain tiff. Search of premises without warrant or order of court, is alleged. Bisbee Review. A trunk full of booze arrived at the Arizona & Eastern depot last Friday morning and almost instantly the minions of the law were on the trail of the suspect ed owner of the trunk. Soon thereafter Dick Troxel was found and a search brought forth the realroad baggage check for the booze laden trunk. Dick waived preliminary examination and was released on $500 bonds to await trial in the superior court. Florence Blade. J. F. Miller came to Kingman yesterday from his camp, twelve miles east of Yucca, where he and others have been at work on a new find of tungsten ores. The big dike in which the tung sten is found traverses the country for a long distance and wherever opened shows good values in the metal. A vein twelve feet wide paraleling the dike also runs high in tungsten. Work has been done on the vein and a good showing of ore has been made. Warden B. Sims of the stale prison at Florence was not in contempt of the supreme court of Arizona when on November 26, he refused to execute Wm. Faltin, the condemned murderer as had been ordered by that tribunal. While the court finds that Mr. Sims overstepped some what his provinces in his failure to see that the man was hanged on the date set for execution, yet the court is inclined to be lieve that he was acting in good faith and not with the intention of going against the order of the court. A shorter hunting season, a re duction of the bag limit and an increase in tne license lees ate among the provisions of a new game law for which initiation petitions will shortly be placed in circulation. The new meas ure which is being drafted by state game warden Willard will reduce the limit on deer to one male each season and will short en the season on deer, turkey, doves, whitewings and quail. An increase in the resident license fee to $1.00 is contem plated as is also a reduction of the foreign license fee. Bisbee Review. OLD AJO 

MINING DISTRICT. Great Future in Store for B!g Cop per Camp. Ajo, located about forty-five miles south of Gila Bend, Ariz , and approximately southwest of Tucson, is one of the oldest min ing districts of North America and has been the scene of more or less mining activity since the time of the Spanish conquest. Within the past two years the Calumet and Arizona company, one of the largest mining oper ators in the state, acquired the Ajo properties, thoroughly ex jierimented with the ore and proved- beyond doubt the great commercial value of the deposit. This resulted in the plans for a 4000-ton daily capacity mill be ing designed, the construction of which is alone awaiting the completion of the branch from the Southern Pacific from Gila Bend, Ariz., to Ajo, and which is under contract to be finished by January 10, 1916. Opportunity never presented a more open nem to tne aggres sive than will be presented here in the next few years where up on untouched ground there will spring up a populace estimated to reach 5.000 people and with possibilities of many other pro mising prospects and undevelop ed resources being brought to a point of commercial advantage Sun. Striking Points in President Wilson's Message. The department of war con templates an increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers and 102,985 en listed men to 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, and sup plementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens. It will be to the advantage of the country for congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and effi ciency. The gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. It is necessary for mafny weighty reasons of national effi ciency and development that we should have a great merchant marine. It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now to undertake we should Day as we go. We should be following an almost universal example of modern government if we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the in come taxes. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefitted Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the independence and prosperity of the states of Centra) and South America is not altered. J
