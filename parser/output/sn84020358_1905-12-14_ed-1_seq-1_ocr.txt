FRUITLESS MEETING. Striking Flnmbers Fall to Reach Agreement in Hartford. Hartford, Dec. 13. Another fruitless meeting of the committees representing the Master Plumbers' association and the striking plumbers was held this afternoon. The meeting was called as the result of the efforts of Mayor Hen- ney to end the strike, and was held In his office, but the mayor was not present, only the two committees. At the conclusion of the conference, which lasted until late in the afternoon, it was announced that no settlement had been reached, although nearly all the points over which the two bodies dif fered previously had been agreed upon. These, however, were minor points, the issue being whether or not the supply plumbers as well as to the masters. This point, it is understood, is the one which prevents a settlement of the long drawn out strike. The masters stoutly hold that the supply houses shall not sell to the "independents,1 while the union, which has the sup port of the independent plumbers holds out for an open supply house. There can be no compromise on that dssue, it is stated, and as both sides announce their intention of toeing firm in the stand taken there seems little likelihood of an immediate termination of the trouble. William Mahl was chairman of the masters' committee, while William Haspey acted in that capacity for the journeymen. Mayor Henney was somewhat put out by the failure of the men to reach an .agree. ment, .but has hopes that the matter will be satisfactorily adjusted in the near future 1XDICT31EXT AGAISST C. & tt.

DEMOCRATIC LINEN WASHING OCCUPIES ATTENTION OF HOUSE FOR FOUR HOURS. Representative Lamar Throws Down Deft to Minority Leader Williams Bitterness Over Failure to be Ap- . pointed on Committees Mr. Will lams' Defense Mr. Shaekleford De nounces All Bosses. , - Washington, Dec. 13 The "wash Of democratic linen for the amusement of republicans," as Mr'. Williams, the mi nority leader, put it Monday, occupied the attention of the house for more "than four hours to-day. The result ac complished was a defl thrown at the minority leader by Representative La mar, of Florida, and another by Rep resentative ShackJeford, of Missouri. The complaint of both resulted from the failure of Mr. Williams to recom mend their reappointment as members of the committee on interstate and for eign commerce. Both made long speeches in which Mr. Williams' lead ership was assailed from many points. Mr. Williams replied to Mr. Lamar at some .length and briefly to Mr. Shackle ford. His defense was that last session the democrats on this committee were divided and he deemed it necessary for the good of the party and the country that a united minority report should be made on the subject of railroad rate legislation. At times there was high tension in the debate. Mr. Lamar was particularly bitter in his criticism and openly declared that his heretofore per sonal friendship for Mr. Williams was forever at an end unless the criticism of himself were retracted- He, how ever, would recognize Mr. Williams as the party leader. , ' Mr. Shaekleford denounced all bosses and placed himself entirely independent of party leadership in the house.. The subject under discussion tfas the committee distribution of the annual message of President Roosevelt. At the conclusion of the democratic debate this had not been accomplished and the house adjourned. Mr. Lamar concluded his remarks with the statement that he considered his removal from the commerce com mittee an act absolutely untenable and an aspersion upon his private charac ter. Mr. Lamar 'said it had gone to the country through the press that the mi nority leader would not tolerate fol lowers of Mr. Hearst. He charge! Mr. (Continued on Eighth Page.)

Peabody Succeeds McCurdy as President of Mutual at a Reduction of 1 00,000 in Salary. New York, Dec. 13. Two Incidents af fecting the life Insurance situation in New York to-day overshadowed tho legislative committee investigation. While :he committee was Inquiring into the conduct of the Prudential Life In surance company and the Metropolitan Life Insurance company, George W. Perkins resigned as first vice president and chairman of the finance committee of the New York Life Insurance com pany. He was succeeded as vie-i pres ident by Alexander E. Orr, president of the New York City Rapid Transit com mission and' as chairman of the finance committee. John Clatlin, head of t.-e H. B- Claflin company. Mr. Perkins is a number of the firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. Another important move in the situa tion was the election by the trustees of the Mutual Life Insurance company to day of Charles A. Peabody to succeed Richard A. McCurdy as president of that company at $50,000 a yoar. Mr Peabody is a lawyer, the American rep resentative of William Waldorf Astor, and a director in several banks and o.her corporations, of which, one is the Illinois Central Railroad company. Mr. Peabody was also nominated as trusted of the Mutual Life Insurance company to succeed Justice Rufus W. Peckham, and Emory McCHhtock was nominated to succeed Ellhu Root. They cannot be elected as trustees until the next meeting of the board. U. S. Senator John F. Dryden of New Jersey, president of the Prudential Life Insurance company, again testified before the investigating committee and made a statement to the committee of his reasons for favoring federal super. vision of life insurance companies through a national Insurance depart ment which he said should have high authority over them. - This, he said, would benefit both the companies and the insured. The tendency of the holders of indus trial policies in the Prudential and Metropolitan Life Insurance compan ies to lapse was examined in great de tail by Charles E- Hughes, counsel of the committee, who quoted a statement of the Prudential company that 72 per cent, of Its Industrial policies lapse within flv-9 years from the date of issue. Senator Dryden declared that this Is much to be regretted from the stand point of the company as well as from that of the insured and thai the ten dency now is toward a greater persist ency on the part of the industrial hold' ers than formerly. The senator assert ed that industrial Insurance, even with high rates and tendency to lapse, is the great economic force now In operation in this country. Just before adjournment to-ady Haley Fiske, vice president of the Met ropolitan company, told of an incident in which that company commissioned William A. Read to buy 3,333 shares of railroad stock for the company. Mr, Fiske said that Mr. Read the same day sold the stock to a company of brokers at $10 a share less than the brokers sold It to the Metropolitan. Mr. Fiske said he had tried to get the money back but Mr. Read refused to surreiv der it. Harrlmnn to Reply. New York, Dec. 13 Edward H. Har rlman to-day wrote to the legislative investigating committee, asking that he be given an opportunity to go on the stand and testify regarding his attempt, as described by Thomas F.

SECRETARY SBAW CN THE ELASTICITY OF CURRENCY SOMETH1XG OTHER THAX BOXD SECURED CIRCULATION M.UST BE PROVIDED. Present Currency Does Jiot Respond to the Varying; Needs of Seasons and Localities Against Any New Form of Money Recognizes That Popular Impression That Sew York Banks Are Solely Responsible for the Pre-' vailing IIJsb Kates of Interest. Buffalo, N. Y.. Dec. 13. Leslie M Shaw, secretary of thetreasury, and George Tate Blackstock of Toronto, Ont-,ohe of the leading lawyers In Can ada, were the principal speakers at the annual banquet of the Buffalo Cham ber of Commerce here to-night. In urging the importance of adding the element of elasticity to the cur rency system, the secretary said: "While our currency is the most con venient and as safe and stable as any In thet world, It does not respond to the varying n:eds of seasons and localities. "If this element of elasticity is to be added somethng other than bond se cured circulation must be provided. "I deem it very imsortant that no new form of money bs authorized Is no Imposition on the public to It be offered a government-guaranteed note ; in lieu of a note secured by a govern ment bond, but It might alarm the cus- tomers of a bank to know that condl- j tions Justified It in resorting to cur rency taxed at six per cent. Some of our worst panics have been sentiment al. The element of elasticity must work automatically and unobserved, otherwise more harm than good will ensue- "Existing conditions at New York emphasize the need of gome provision for supplying the elementsof elasticity. i recognize the popular Impression that New York banks are solely responsible for prevailing high raujs of interest. I will not attempt to apologize for the banking fraternity, but a willingness to loan every available dollar has not been confined to New York, nor has the disposition to borrow every dollar obtainable been confined to Btock spec ulators. "The western banker who sent his money to New York la midsummer to be loaned on call, regardless of rate, has a legitimate right to call It home; He must not be criticised for so do ing, nor must he be surprised at the naturally, and . Inevitably follows t Us withdrawal. "The spirit of, speculation, rife dur ing the summer, was fed and intensi fied toy the unusual . influx of money from the interior and the west. Who is to be censured? I. answer, all or none. The. man who loans to stock speculators on satisfactory security Is no better and no worse than he who loan's to the real estate speculator on Satisfactory terms. It was well known In July that money would be scarce In the fall. If the treasury department had not foreseen what was coming, and called In a few millions from the deposits then held by the banks to be used to relieve .this, stringency, .should It extend to the prejudice of legitimate business, there might be some slight reason for distrust. I think, however, the business interests of t the country understood that the treasury can easi ly spare $20,000,000 and more If nec essary for the relief of legitimate bus iness, and I think It generall under stood that It will not be released un less business conditions demand it. The responsibility Is not a thing to be coveted, and I therefore plead, not for Inflation, but for such modification of our present currency system as will cause it automatically to expand to meet the increased needs of varying seasons and as promptly contract to the legitimate surbng of unwarranted spedulaton." 

AFTER HARVARD PITCHER. Athletic Committee Criticised for Granting Cobtirn Permission to Pitch. Cambridge, Mass., Dec. 13. The Har vard Bulletin, a weekly graduate pub lication, will publish an editorial to morrow crltlsizlng the action of the Harvard Athletic committee In grant ing permission to Paul N. Coburn to pitch for the university nine In Inter college games. Coburn has pitched three years and part of afourthr for Harvard. The edutorlal says: "We believe that the Harvard athlet ic committee has made another mistake in deciding that Coburn may play on the university baseball team next spring. It Is said In behalf of Coburn that he has a legal right to play. No No one has a right to represent Har vard In intercollegiate sport; to do so should b eregarded as a special priv ilege. The action of the athletic com mute had caused a good deal of un favorable comment from some of our rivals and from the public. In our pinion, that is one of the things to be avoided, even if to do so we lose a man who is valuable to the nine. "We believe, however, that it would be better for the team In the long run to give some of the younger and less i experienced men a chance to pitch on tv vniversity nine."

Presdent Henry S. Prtchett, who has been executve head of the (Massachusetts 'Insttute of Technology to-day handed his resigna tion to the corporation of that Institu tion.

The statement which accompanies President Frltchett's resignation 1 fol lows: "In taking up this new work Presi dent Prltchett expressed to the trustees of the institute his keen regret at sep arating from the institute, Its officers and faculty and students. He exvress es no less regret at ; leaving Boston and Massachusetts, for both fit which he has formed the strongest ties, i "The work of the Foundation, while primarily that of a pension system-for teachers, involves educational work of a most important nature, and a most interesting relation with a large num ber of institutions. It was this con sideration which led him to accept the new duties in the place of older ones.'' The resignation is to take effect at such time as may be deolded upon by the trustees of the ' institute. Presi dent Prltchett has been at the head of the institute for over five years. He strongly advocated an alliance of the Institute with Harvard university, but the proposition, which had been for mally considered by the officials ot both Institutions, called forth a protest from "Tech." graduates, and was later voted down by the trustees of the in stitute. , As soon as he is relieved from . his present duties President Prltchett will go to New York where he will make his headuarters in the direction of the Carnegie fund. This endowment has for its object the pensioning of old and needy professors of American educa tional Institutions. New Britain Police Start Crusade. New Britain, Dec. 13.
