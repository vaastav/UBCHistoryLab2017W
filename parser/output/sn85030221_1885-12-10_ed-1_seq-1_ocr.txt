In the eecond paper of thla acrica Tub Nawe gave aom valuable add reliable detain the matter of prospecting for coal where to look for it, and indicat ing where it would bo worao than o leea lo .attempt tu find lv. Thia information waa based upon the known aeological formation ol the alat, and from actual obedrvatioae in the field.- Stated In brief, it waa to dig west of the cropping, inefiad of eaat. becanae of tbe dip of tbe strata to west and. northwest speaking generally. It was ali alaUid. that paying coal would n 't 1 found weet of an irregular line drawn from Leaven worth to tbu wist lino of Chau tauqua county, but that anywhare eaat of that linn, It would be profitable to eek.for 1L The question of pure water and plenty ot It, is a very important one to tbe peo ple of Kansas, particularly upn the up lands, and it la in the interest of these that we desire more particularly to apeakT There ia no fact more generally under stood tbau the simple oue that water will aeak lie lowest lewl. No man of intelligence would place bis spouting along the rldguboarda of hit roof to catch the water falling npon that roof, but aa a matter ol , course be would place It at the loweat part, and he would be rewarded by securing all the water that ahould fail. The geology f Kan. aaa teachea us that the varloua strata lope to Tkt northwest, some of which, like the abates or the car boniferous period, are impervious to water hence, water fulling npon them, would naturally paa down ward oyer Iheae aurracea in a north westerly direction. Por instance: It there ahould be a body ol high land be tween two parallel ravlna, the ravines rnnnln? northeast and southwest, ac- eocorJIng to lha theory here laid down the water lalllna up'jo Ibis high laud would pass through the soil and drill in northwesterly direction, aud appear in the form of SDrloM, perhaps, on the eaat aide of tbe west ravine indicated la such a body of land, therefore, the place to look for water would be at the . loweet point of the strata, or on the eaat aide of the west ravine. In all ravines, therefore, according to thla rule.tt would be beat to open wells on the eaat aide, rather than on the west. There is an old aud truu eaying, that "the proof or the pudding is iu the en' In it:" and tbe !roo( in this case cu be ascertained by ad answorto the question Where are our springs tonnd f Are they on the east or west aides or ravines t The cortocl answer to tuat question es tablishes, n a ruin, the truth ot error ol the position we take. If it is true, there fore, that springs aro lound whero indl catad, that la lha place to put down wells that will not fall.

ENGLISH ELECTIONS. Tho English nation U America's only competitor, as a l"-e or In tbe world's civilization, au-7 her policy is of prime Importance and Interest. Being arepie- sematlvo government, tha people large ly determine the governmental policy in the character of the intn they select to seats in parliaraeut. Of the iesuca now before tho English, for aetilement, there are few whoe Jouiliuca are sharply drawnTor which involve- great Interests, whether affecting the moral or mate rial interests of her people, saye par haps the Irish question. This much- lalkcd of difficulty has now settled down to an independent parliament for Ireland for the administration of her purely lo cal affairs. The Nationalist party of both Ireland and England are making thla a clear cut question in the pending elections The Liberal party, at whose bead ia Mr. Gladstone, perhapa repreaenta the beat element of the English people her "shopkeepers" aod human itarians. Gladstone is a safe man. He would rather haye a aa tiou at peace tbau ut war, and ia truly loyal to the beat Interests of bis govern ment, and promoted by bumano instincts in hla foreign policy. Tbe Tories and Conservatives represent varying ahadea ot politics! questions, but have no ag gressive policy. Tti'-y are rather on tbe defensive ol old lnsutulioua from the Imaginary attacks or the Liberal parly. The ttuta of the matter is that the present elec'ion In England ia tnrnin? upon the personal qualifications of Mr, Gladstone, rather than upon any well, di'flabd issues Whin the Irish ques tion comes up f r definite solution, it is our judgment that Mr. Parnell will find a nulled tront of all the other oariies against him, because his policy threat ens (he integrity ut Ihe empire.

Bait Lakb, Dec. 9 Of the report of tbe city council the Tribune say a: The best answer is a brief statement of the facts. As tbe Edmunds law has been executed tbe rage and hatred of tbe Mormon people has Increased, and their fury has been daily - intensified by the tbe Mormon press, which pictured tbe federal officers as the scum of the earth, and the execution of the law as a perse cution. Tbe affair of July 4, the open threats cf tbe Mormon press and the preachers' assaults on tbe houses of the federal officers, and tbe beating of dep. uty marshals, are but the steps leading to one certain point. The attempted assassination of Marshal Collins brought about a climax, and tbe threat ened violence waa so imminent that many believed it would come.- The Deseret Tievct cried out asking how much longer before the people would be aroused to tury, and two days later the Herald declared the public mind wrought to a high pitch that would be dangerous In any community. It then proceeded lo describe .Deputy Marshal Collins ss a murderer, aod ss far aa pos sible to further inflame the populace. Outside, the Mormon people were quite as violent. - Soma KfTects.

When tbe believ- ea s ripht to interpret the sacred books is acknowledged, a place is left open for exegesis, but that exegesis still remains -the slave of particular tests or dogmas that limit and conseauentlv trammel it. Let us take a single story" from the Di me that or J on all, and examine the dif ferent acceptations it has received. We could hardly find a richer stock of inter pretations vitiated by what I call the re ligious prejudice. According to the ra tionalist mode of interpretation that nourished in Germany at the beginning of this century, Jonah was an envoy from Israel to Kineveh, who waa picked up after having been shipwrecked, throe days from the shore," by a ship carrying tho imaga of a whale as its figure-head! Another interpretation is that of Grimm, that tho whole lustory passed off in a dream. This is to save tne letter, but at the expense of the ppirit. The important matter in the critical study of a text is to find what its authors intended to put in it, and not what it ought to contain in order to conform to our ideas of truth or of justice. "There have been nnd still are," sa-d Denn Stanley, relative to these points, m his funeral address on Sir Chaxles Lyell at Westminster Abbev. "two methods of interpretation which have" wholly and justly failed: the one that attempts to distort the real sense of the words of tho Bible, to make them speak the language of science; and the one which tries to falsifv science, in or der to satisfy the supposed exigencies of the Bible."

Twenty-five vears ago the buttons used on dresses and cloaks were made mostly of metal, some in imitation of silver and some of gold. They were of great size, in fact quite as large as a modern indi vidual butter-plate. Calicoes and chint zes were adorned in those davs with agate buttons in all colors, purples and reds predominating. After these, there came in smaller buttons of various kinds, among others the variety known as horn, which had a long run and was very popular. At this time, too, there were worn immense buttons of solid pearl, through which the prismatic colors were always shifting, in changing lights. There were nickel buttons, decorated with designs of stars; there were queer. brass buttons, and glass ones, wonder fully ana fearfully made, lnere - were conical, white porcelain buttons the more pointed the more fashionable; there were brass buttons in designs of acorns; there were buttons made of brass open-work, over red lining; these and a myriad of others made up tlio quaint sum of button worn a -scora or so ol years ago. After this small pearl buttons, or shut buttons, as they were then called, came into use. . They were were set very thickly together on dress fronts, and for a time were so small as to be scarcely visible. The metal buttons, too, depre ciated perceptibly in the matter of size, the glass ones and porcelain ones as well, until tbe rage for small buttons was as great as the rage for largo ones had been. About this time there came in a craze for buttons in designs of gooseberries, currants, raspberries, blackberries, and grapes. Masses of bright little enrwnts uacu ias uu iu liii; uuub ui a nvui.iu 0 dress, and great blackberries worn on ..II ,n . r. MAn- n -.-...V-.. n 1 suk attire used to hall tempt the unwary into takm? a bite of the luscious fruit. Solid jet balls, too. were used at this time, and formed a trimming for dresses not unlike the jets used nowadays. There were also used long Jet buttons, very similar in shape to a fat darK color ed worm. These were used largely on dress fronts with braided plastrons and various other designs, and were consid ered very reenercne, as they were always expensive and required incalculable time ana panence to keep them sewed on m place. There was a time when buttons were not considered an essential part of a dress, so far as harmony of shade and colloring was concerned, but that day is long 6ince past The buttons nowadays are selected with more care perhaps than is any other element which enters into tho make-up of a costume. The colors in them must harmonize with the body of the dress, down to the finest shadings, and the size must be proportioned ac cording to the style of goods used, and tne design ol toilet followed, street suits, made of rough imported cloths, are now adorned with buttons of enor mous size, mostly in bronze, and deco rated "with a various designs. Some are made in medallion heads, some in land scapes, some m wheat sncaves; others are made of shell and are many-colored and brilliant; still others are imitations of cameo, and others are a enrioua mix ture of gilt and silver. These buttons would never do for house-wear, but worn in the street on bcaw clothes thev are quite appropriate and very stylish. They are decidedly expensive and their only rivals are the novel bronze buckles, some of which come in beautiful designs of locust leaves, and are made to serve the same purpose as buttons- The old-fash ioned button-molds, once so fashionable, have been revived of late in crochet but tons, and will be used this season on black cloth and silk suits. . Small crochet buttons and flat silk-covered are always preferred by modest women, and so are alwavs used to a treat extent. Tbe gaudiest buttons used are the big gilt ones, which are usually affected by school-girls and very young ladies. Handsome bronze buttons are toe rage so far this season, and will probably con tinue to be so, judging from present ap pearance. Denver-1 riuune ucfiioacan.

The really mysterious element of life in St. Petersburg is one that transcends Western experiences. - Below the out ward forms of things you enter an at mosphere in which thought seems limit ed by new laws. Out of novel habits, strange - customs, hereditary legacies of the intellect in which you nave had no share, the fancy makes a stair for its as cent into another planet. The differen ces you encounter everywhere are un likeneases not between Aryan and Aryan, but between Europe and Asia on the one hand, between a new and an old civili zation on the other. Readily would the native help you in your bewilderments, were it within his power, bat the abnor mal to you ' is the normal to him. ion call upon him to look, and he sees noth ing. Your spectres aro his thin air, tbe novelties yon italicize his dtffiy common place. So that in time your surprise be comes less demonstrative, if not less acute. In time your diary is content to hold the mirror up to nature. "The mu nicipal council," for example, "haa just fixed tho price of bread for the next twelve months." "The Golos punished for "improper tendencies' by an order de priving it for six months of the right to publish advertisements." "Tho authori ties about to raise money by imposing a tax on all foreigners resident in St, Petersburg." "Newspapers contain ap peals on behalf of poor families in the capital." "A well-known police official purchases the wife of a subordinate for ten thousand roubles." "Newspaper proprietor exiled to a northern province for having published a cartoon repre senting, in a scries of nine views, the torments of a dog attacked by a wasp, and finally forced to retire into kennel: the whole without head-line, but believed in official circles to be an allusion to the Tsar's enforced retirement to Gatchina." "Honseholders warned that the morrow is tho 'name-day' of the empress, and that they must celebrate on the occasion that is to say, hang out banners and burn lamps or to pay a heavy penalty." And thus it runs on, the record of events, a mere story of familiar experience to the native Russian, but to the foreigner a tale of doings in a world all other than his own. It may be well here to remind the Toi dr, tlinf. th it u Ki f rt 1 Wrin ct in trufy- ings is general in St Petersburg. sV far as Russian life is a bivouac, the term "lodgings" is aptly used; etvmolog ically, it corresponds with the English "house" or "home," ana is therefore without the sense usually associated with it in the west In the capital a man who lives in his own house occupies lit tle more than a corner of it, or sleeps in a palace, borne of the richest families are content with lodgings, and but few of them need all the apartments which constitute a St Petersburg flat This is in itself suggestive of the scale upon which houses are built in the great Rus sian cities. But it is all too inadequate as preparation for the statement that a St Petersburg lodging-house frequently contains as many as a thousand rooms, witn a population ol trom two to three thousand persons. The finest apartment are on the ground uoor; the poorest are reached by ascent of from ten to twelve stones. A suit of six rooms suttices lor the wealthiest lodgers who have no pal ace of their own. Two or three supply all the needs of the well-to-do trades man and his family; tho maiority of pro fessional men who are bachelors, and a large class of officials find themselves amply accommoaatea Dy a single apart meat The cost of lodgings depends, of course, upon such elements as situation. number and furnishing of rooms, height ol fiat, ana service, as a rule, it may be said that, taking into consideration the rreneral nurchasinz rower of the monev exnended a nrecaution consist ently neglected in international compari sons of this land bouse rent is some what higher in St Petersburg than it is in Jt'ana or jjonaon. 1 oner these aet&us simply in order that the reader may be better prepared for a singular custom to which I here invite his attention. Rent charges in Russia are invariably exacted "in advance," even when a lodger sur . . - - - rounds tumseii witn iuggage valuable enough to yield the amount of a whole year's arrears. Upon personal property of this kind there can be legally no lien. The same Russian law which hampers foreigner and native alike with the po lice surveillance of passport regulations. seizing every opportunity to throw ob stacles in the way of free movement. gives to a lodger the fullest right to car ry off bis luggage in the teeth of an irate landlord clamoring for the settlement of his unpaid bilL Any forcible detention of property in such cases is treated by the courts as-a quasj-crlnnrial onense. How easy it is, under such circumstan ces, to attach to a whole class an un deserved stigma of sordid caution, or of siisniciotrs distrust of their fellow-beings. will be at onoe seen. The law itself is an interesting survival; Hs origin, as a defense of personal rie-hts in the country where the modern nkaz so frequently ig nores them, must lie as deeply in histori cal causes as the democratic period it tell.

Vaccination statistics are being taken in the Americus schools preparatory to enforcing the order ot Ibe State Board of Health regarding compulsory yaccin atlon. We find in talking with a num ber of the prominent citizens of the place a decided opposition to Its enforce ment Although, perhaps, we will not be as bad aa tbe Canadians were and re Bert to mob violence, yet every effort will be made against the enforcement of the act, which will result In legal suits, if not In mob violence. So strong is the feeling against contaminating innocent children with the virus of the bovine in this vicinity that many have already gone so far as to declare their intention to override law and order and take matters Into their own hand to fight the matter to the last extremity, and to win if it ia within the power ot mortals to do so. We would like to ask, for the sake of information, if the State Board of Health have and what power they pos sess to enforce so arbitrary an enactment t Do we know aoy law that does not ap pear between tbe two lids of the statute except common law T And is it a uni versal and common law that our persons must be violated against our will t Must we suffer the psins and ills of we know not what to escape the ills that do not threaten ust Must we be punctured, lacerated and contaminated, for the pur pose ot getting sick, when wa are feeling well, only to replenish the purses of a class of physicians t Whence our rights endowed to as by the constitution, which guarantees our persons shall be Inviolate, except in cases of felonies and misdemeanors t Is it a telony not to submit to the knife of the physician f Or, In other words, is it the people or the state board or health tbat is running the great commonwealth of Kansas t Tbe ladies of the U. P. chcrch will serve fresh oysters and supper on Christ mas night at tbe church. A cordial in vitation is extended to everybody. Our Americus correspondent is more hasty than wise in his denunciation of compulsory vaccination. It is sate to assert that ior one injury resulting from vaccination, ten thousand lives have beea saved. We speak advisedly. His tory records tbe time when whole coun tries were decimated by this dread scourge, and the aggregate of deaths will never be known. Any reasonable system or preventive measure like vac cination should be warmly approved by all. It is easy to raise a prejudice, but In this case history and the Judgment of tbe members of all reputable schools of medicine approve it Farms are pro- I vided on which cattle are raised for the j purpose of providing vinu, all under tbe control of competent boards of physi cians, and there need be little fear for injurious res a He.
