Some montns pgo the papers began to say that prices would go down, that they had begun to go down. -and that they would go still further. What was the result? If a man needed a coat he would naturally wait until the prices came down. He would wait just as long as, he could. And then another would wait and another and another until pretty soon there was no buying. The tailor and the retailer could not sell any coats. Then, of course, they could not buy from the wholesaler, nor the wholesaler from the manufacturer, and so the whole course of business from the con sumer up or down, if you prefer to the manufacturer, was at a stands still.

Washington Dec 7 Calling attention to the fact that the United States is the "sample Democracy of the World," and as such is constantly under world scrutiny, President Woodrow Wilson in hia last congressional message today urged upon Congress the duty of making this nation the champion of right and justice i)n world affairs. " Only by rectifying wrongs within our own borders and championing the right wherever it is in danger, the President pointed out, can the United States fulfill its destiny and keep faith with the fathers of the Republic. The Presidents message made no mention of the League of Nations, nor any international aspect in parti cular. It was a short, message and more than half of it was devoted to domestic affairs. At the last moment. President Wil son yielded to the wishes of his phy sician and did not attempt to go to the Capitol and deliver the message in person before a joint session of the two houses. Instead, a few min utes before the message was trans mitted to each house separately and there was read to the members. The first half of the presidential message was devoted to expressions of this faith and the - urging upon Congress its duty to make America indeed the. triumphal force for right and justice. ; . : "' ""'-' Then, turning to domestic affairs, the President recommended to Con gress the following: The passage of . a Budget ' bill to stabilize the governments finances. Stricter economy in governmental expenditures in order that the burden of taxation be lighted and the na tional debt decreased. . Revision and simplification of the' taxation system which he declared has become "an immediate . neces sity." Granting to the Philippines their independence, "as they have succeed ed in maintaining - a stable govern ment." The President himself summed, up his message in its final paragraph: "I have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations," he said, "as I have sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred, and which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I 'believe this to he the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in days to come, whether in America or else where." ' The text of President Wilson's mess age to Congress today, was as fol lows : "Gentlemen of the Congress: "When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the Presi dent by the constitution to present to you an annual report of the state of the Union, I found my thought dom inated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's: "Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we under stand it.' "A sentence immortal because it embodies in a form of utter simplic ity and purity the essential faith of the nation, the faith in which it was conceived and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With that faith and the birth of a nation founded upon it," came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of man kind, an order in which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and force, and I . believe Foes of Broad Street See Hard Fight Ahead Mayor's Position Stronger After Clever Separation of Issues. Mayor Wilson's clever evasion of the effort to consolidate the issues for the $2,700,000 school bond pro ject and the Broad street extension before the Board of Aldermen today strengthened the growing belief that opponents of the Broad street plan will know that they have been in a fight before the Mayor is counted out. Many spectators last night attended the meeting of the new Board of Al dermen and were all set for a show down between the school and the Broad street projects. But the clever est kind of management by the' May or succeeded in keeping these issues apart, for the night at least. This action on the part of the city execu tive was exclusively forecast in yes terday's "Times." V In his message to the board, which presented an all-Republican, flavor for the first time in Bridgeport's his tory, the Mayor made his best argu ment yet presented for the street ex tension, and his confident manner throughout- the evening gave foes of the scheme some concern. . .(Continued on Page 16.) D eaimg airs that I express the wish and purpdse of every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our ex ercise of influence upon the affairs of the world. "By this faith, and bv this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its present confusion and despair. If was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the war came when the German people fouira themselves face to face with the conscience of the world and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was at tempting to perpetrate. I .tt'nk, therefore, that it is true to say that this was he faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. "This is the mission upon which democracy came into the world. "Democracy is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to be treated justly as against any at tempt on the part of any combination of individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of right or privilege, and I think we all realize that the day ha3 (come when democracy is being put upon its final test. The old world is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democ racy and a substitution of the prin ciple of autooracy as asserted in the name, b,ut without the authority and sanction of Jhe multitude. This is the time, of all others when democracy should prove its purity and its spirit ual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail. "There are two ways in which the United States can assist to accom plish this great object: First, by of fering the example within her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionably just and which are equal in their administra tion laws which secure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the integrity of prop erty, and particularly of that property which I devoted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world. Sec ond, by standing for right and justice as towards individual nations. The law of democracy is for the protection of the weak, and the in fluence of every democracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nation, the. nation which is struggling towards its right and to wards its proper recognition and priv ilege in the family of nations. The United States cannot refuse this role of champion without . putting the (Continued on Page Seven.)
