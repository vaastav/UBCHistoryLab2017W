These are tho live chief cities of New Jcrsoy, and if to them ho added Hoboken, famed In romanco nnd pictorial narratlro, with a population of Jifi.OOO. nnd Hllzabolb, with one of 45,000. a total of 075,0i'0 city population will be given, or nearly 40 per cent, of tho total population of tho Stato. It Is south Jersey, sparsely populated and containing no larger city than Camden, hlch deprives Now Jersey of what would oth erwise) be Its distinction of being tbo State having tho densest population. The big coun ties of Southern Jersey represent very little In respect of tbo number of Inhabitants. Hurling tnn county, for Instance, tho largest In New Jorsey, hprends ner HUD square miles.

New Jersey Is, Indeed, a Stato of man contrasts. Large manufacturing cities and primitive rural settlements aro both nu merous, the former chiefly In the north, nnd tho latter nutly in tho south.

BBOOKLTX PRIMARIES XO.SIOllT. Factional Spirit IHch-Mr. Woodratr'n Fallnre aa u llarmonlcer. The Republican primaries In Brooklyn to night are to bo held In each of tho 020 election district associations and will be for tbe choice of officers of the associations and of delegates to the ward associations, which will In turn send delegates to the County Committee, the govern ing body of tho organization. The caoture of the County Committee is of course the special aim of the bitterly contend ing factions under the lead of County Clerk Jacob Worth and City Works Commissioner Theodore B. Willis, respectively. Lleut-Gor.-elect Timothy L. Woodruff has been working hard for several dayB to harmonize the factions, bnt yesterday had to give up tho Job as hope less. It was reported by a Willis man that Mr. Woodruff had proposed that ex-Senator Thomas C. Piatt be allowed to namo tho Chair man of thenow committee, and that tho proposi tion was rejected. Last night the lines were closely drawn on each side, and there wAs every indication that the primaries would be hotly contested. The battle may be so close that the result will not be posi tively determined until the organization of tho new County Committee, next week. Should the Worth faction win, Mr. Silas B. Dutcher.a mem ber of the Greater NewJYork Commission, will Srobably be elected Chairman of tbe committee. Ir. Dutcher Is a veteran Republican, bnt for f ome time has not been active in politics. Nearly twenty years ago be was one of tho Kings county Republican triumvirate, which wj known aa ''The Three Graces," his associates being Gen. Benjamin F. Tracy and Gen. James Jourdan. Tbe Indications all point to tbe slaughter of the Willis forces and to another victory for the Piatt element In the organization. For the first time In several years Mr." Worth has succeeded In naming the regular ticket In his own district In the Nineteenth ward. Hitherto the silk stockings, headed by Mayor Wurster, have been able to hold the district against him. Whatever tho result of the primaries may be. there Is sure to be a rumpus tn the new commit tee over a resolution which is to be presented endorsing Mr. Choate for the Senatorship. RIOTS IS HAMBURG.

It win considered nt tho palace Impolitic to talk about tho sub ject, nnd It ns hoped the report would soon be forgolton.

Tho editors of theso newspapers havo called at the Polaco before malting their statements, receiv ing hints for their articles from tho Marquis of Ahumndaaud the Marquis of Pnlmorola, secre tary of the Captain-General of tho Island, The origin of tho news Is attributed by these Spanish editors to the Cuban Junta In New York, which they nbuso In tbo grossest terms. Till; Sun nnd other New York news papers aro called "ofllclal organs of tho Junta.' The Dfnrfo ilr tit .Varfrni has a letter from Us correspondent in New York, Seflor A. Cuyas, to tbo effect tbat tho Junta has bought tho Ameri can press nnd tho prominent men who defend the Cuban causo In America, giving them mil lions In bonds payable when Cuba shall bo free. This infamous calumny was first printed when tbo meeting of Nov. 27 In Checkering Hall took place, and now Is repeated In respect to tbe assassination of Macco. Among tho Cubans In Ilavnna thero Is great Indignation over these insulting chnrges against tho American friends of Cuba, because the Spanish newsiutpeis do not spare any name. The responsibility for the Insults rests upon the Spanish Government, for not n Blngle line la published in tho Havana press without tho pre vious consent and endorsement on the proofs of tho Government censor. The Spaniards declare that Senators Mills, Morgan, Call, nnd every other member of the American Senate known as a friend of Cab Is bribed by tho Junta of New York. They say with regard to tbo assassination of Gen. Maceo that tho story published In New York was con cocted betneen Sefior Estrada Palma and the American newspapers. Gen. Weylor hns received a long despatch from Minister Dupuy do Lome In which the General is urged to stoutly deny that Maceo was murdered. Soilor Dupuy do Lome considers It of the greatest Importance to the Spanish cause to efface as toon as possible the Indignation pro duced in the United States by the treacherons act of Spain. From Madrid also Wcyler has received a long despatch which is supposed by some to be from tbe Duke of Tetuan and by others from Canovaa del Catltto himself. What Is positively known H that the despatch related to the death of Ma ceo. and that Weyler had a privnte consultation la-.t night with the Marquis of Ahumada. In the opinion of the Spanish press nt Havana, the muln proof that .Maceo was not assassinated or lured Into nn ambush by a traitor In his own ranks Ir tho text of tho diary of Francisco Go mez, published In full In Havana, in the part which rends us fotlovvb: !cr.Mtrn, 1600. 2d.

"It Is clear, therefore." says the ninrfn. "that tho body nt Maceo as nbanduned by tho Cu bans, who all lied uway except Gomez." But nothing In these arguments convinces public opinion, as all these arguments nppearto bo flugiant contradictions of other Spanish offi cial report. The diary ofGomez proves. If am thing, that the report uf Dr. Zerlucha that Muceo went around the trortia tn boats is false, or that If the report 1 ttue tbe diary is faUe. The, marine authorities, interested In proving thnt Maceo did not pass from I'iuar del Rio to Havana in boats, say that tho diary is true. This really aggravates the riuirge against Abumnda. Weyler. nnd Zerlucha that in order tn nssnnslnato Maceo In the province of Havana no ro?istunco was offered to him in crossing the trnebn. With regard to the alleged letter of tlio son of Gomez, it does not say that the Cubans aban doned the body of Muceo in a tight. Major Clrujeda's first report was thai he retired to Puma Bruva without knowing thnt his forces killed Maceo, but that after examining tbe pa pcrs nnd articles found by his soldiers nn the bodies he returned tn the field In bring the bodies buck, and then found that they had dis appeared.

Sen nlor Yoorhees was appointed United States Dis trict Attorney In Indiana by rrcsldent Duchanan In 1858, and his ofllclal labors therefore date, back to antebellum days. Senator Voorhees entered tho rfouse uf Representatives In 1801 and took his seat a. Senator lav 1877. IIo Is, undeniably, o Demo cratic veteran In Congressional service, though, of course, he cuts llttlo figure as a veteran when compared with tho Hon. Isham Harris of Memphis, who arrived In Congress from Tennesseo In 1810 ana Is there yet, his term not expiring until 11101. The so-called sliver States, In whleh very little was expected for the Republican electoral ticket this year, did better for McKIntey and Itobart than some of tho Southern States, in which the col ored vote Is considerable. Major MeKinley polled more votes tn Idaho than ha did In Mississippi, more In Colorado than he did In Ixiulslana, and more tn Wyoming than ho did In South Carolmv. Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina are the three States In whleh tbe number of colored eltltcns Is In excess of the number of white cltliecs. Oar ret A. nobart'a majority for Vice-President was 130,000 more than Major McKlnloy'a majority ror President, and the Watson electoral ticket polled 1B0.000 votes more than either the Palmer or Lev. erfng electors. Ten thousand votes were cast at the late Presidential election for the Pentley and Southgate broad-gaugo Prohibition ticket, one of the principles of which was woman suffrage. This tlukct did best In Indiana. The leaders of the German organisation orlg nauy called the Oerman Reform Union have wisely dropped tbe word "reform" and are now organizing for this year's light. Their severance from tho former State mocracy Is complete, and without them the Stoto Democracy, or National Democracy, as It has now eomo to be called, tbe title changing each yir, la without any popular support whatever tn many of the districts, though some men prominent as leaders In Democratlo movements tn the past have much "confidence tn a future ror It as a State organization. The German-American Democrats are working hard to effect an organization In all the districts, and they are encouraged by their suc cess so far. While the'Stato of New Yark under the practical operation of the Raines liquor tax law seems likely to have a considerable balance, unused. In the State treasury on Jan. 1. tho Stato of Iowa, which has long eujovet' tho distinction of being well man aged financially. Is confronted with a probable def icit or 300,00C, and as biennial sessions of tho Legislature are the rule In tho Hawkeyo State, It Is thought probable tbat the deficit will reach a mil lion dollars beforo legislative a:tlon can bo taken concerning It, the shortage being met meanwhile by tho Issuance of bonds. Iowa la a Stato which enjoys splendid financial credit. In IKOn, tho time of tbo last census, Iowa was practically without debt, tho total amount of the bonds outstanding being at that time 12(3,000, the principal nf which has not matured. Tbo other States practically without debt at that time were Vermont. Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Nebraska. Virginia owed nearly 133.000.000. Louisiana

Though the population of Illinois Is very much larger than tho population of Indiana, nnd though territorially tt Is 30 per cent, larger, Illinois, with many needful expenses, has scarcely any State debt, whereas Indiana owes a larger sum than any of tho states of the North nearly 8,000,O0O. Long Island City will celebrate on May 8 Its twenty-sixth anniversary as an Incorporated city. It was established as a village tn 1830. and has supplied the courts of New York with more sensa. tional litigation than any other city tn thr State. It was tbe only New York city at the recent elec tion w hlch was carried hy Drynn. The controversy between the advocates and op. ponents of civil service la not likely to he carried on very vigorously so far as It relates to Federal offices, for there are now onlv 781 of these, ex. elusive of the chief Presidential appointments, not Included In tbe list. An effort Is to be mado by tho Republican oppocents of civil service this year to secure tbe adoption of a regulation by the Legislature doing away with some of the "auto, matto" teats. Dut labor In this dlreotlon Is, to a great extent,: stalled by the civil service provision of tho Stale Constitution, which the Legislature has no power to Interfere with. There were nearly 3,000 Prohibition votes cast In Kentucky at the recent election. The New Eng land States havo become, as the returns shjw, tho best recruiting ground for tbe Socialists, They polled 2,lUvoteatn Massachusetts, 1,223 In Con. noctlcut, and 338 In Rhode Island. In the presont IIouso of Representatives, accord ing to tho classification of tho Clerk, there are 12 ropulists, 15 Fusionlsts, and 8 Blborltos, a total of 80 representatives of orgnnliations supporting Rryan at the ro:ent election, against 124 straight Democrats, as they are rallod. The straight Demo, crntlo vote, so called, at tho recent election was about 0,000,000, aud the outside organizations polled collectively about one-lwelfm as many, though they bar one-fifth of tho representation In Congress. Tho reduction In tnejnumber of election districts In town next year wtll further deersaso tho ex penses of the city for election purposes, and, moreover, will have tho effect of ettalllng addi tional labor upon tbe election dtstrlit workers of the two parties In town. At present the average number of voters In a city election dlitrlct Is about 200, but In next year's contest It Is to bo raised to 400, and a thorough canvass of an election district having 400 voters, which Is equlvilent lo about 2,(00 Inhabitants, Is not a task to lie underrated. There aro many counties lu the United Slates which have less than 2,300 pupubtlon, nnd In some rontons of New York tho cinvass of such large districts will email tho emilojment of an assistant or deputy captain.

BATTLE SHIP TEXAS. ABrEBSD CRITICISMS AXSTTBRBD ill' BECRETARr HERBERT, Charles Crans Defends the Vessel, and Hny Thnt Criticism or Our rJhlps Ilnvo Ileen JDnmiiElns to American Ship Ilnllders MeeklnK Farelitn Contracts. Wasiiinoton, Dec. 10. Tho Naty Depart ment Issued nn ofllclal statement this morning to demonstrate that tbo battle ship Texas, In stead of being In any degreo n failure, ranks with the finest warships In tho world, nnd la not surpassed by any American naval vessel. Tho occasion for this announcement Is Secretary Herbert's approt al of a Court of Inquiry record, which found no one responsible for the unfortu nnto foundering of tho vessel recently nt the Now York Navy Yard. Secretary Herbert's statement Is ns follows: "In giving out tho action of tbe department on the findings of the recent Court of Inquiry, as to tho accident which resulted tn tho sluklng of tho Texns nt tbo Navy Yard. Now York, I hnve concluded to depnrt from my usual cus tom, nnd mako a gcncrnl statement about this ship. Of courso tho publto knows thnt the accl tlor.t about which this Court of Inquiry was hold could not havo occurred nt sen. that It hap pened because apart of an Injection plpo had been tnkon out for repairs, and tbat tho ship was promptly ralsod without having suffered any material damage. So many criticisms of this vessel have been mado that the public, ora part of It at least, may bo dlepoaod to regard her as valueless. "The Texas was laid down by Mr. Whitney. A board of emlnont naval officers awarded to a promlnont English designer, Mr. John, the prlzo that had been offered by the department for tho best plans of a batllo ship of given di mensions. At that tlmo, and for somo years afterward, tho Navy Department, through tho Bureaus of Construction and Repair and of Steam Knglnecring, wns expending considerable money annually In tbe procurement of draw ings, plans. &c from nbtoad; wo wcro avail ing ourselves of tho experience of foreign nn tluns. " Considerable objection wns made by somo of tho officers of tho department to tho building of n ship on tho plans qt tho Texas, and tho ques tion wns beforo ruoro tban ami board during the administration of Secretary Whitney, and uf tcr wuid during tho administration of Secretary Tracy. Tho plans having been again brought In question, were submitted lo otbor boards, nna they wcro again and again approved, and so the coubtructlon of tho ship proceeded nt the Norfolk Navy Yard until, during this ndmlnla trntlon, sho was completed and sent to sea. "Thero have been several accidents to the ship since she was commissioned. Different pnrts of her machinery havo from tlmo to tlmo de veloped defects, and It at ono time become up parent that her bottom needed stiffening. Mie was sent to tho Nuvy Yard nt Norfolk and her bottom was stiffened, ana her defects have, it Is bcllovcd. speaking generally, all been rcaedled, except thoso relutlng to her turret and tho system of water-tight compartments developed by tbe recent flooding of the es--el, ns shown by tho finding of tbo Court of In quiry given out herewith. Tho department has given orders that theso deficiencies bo com pletely remedied, which can and will bo done in nfew weeks nt the New York Navy Ynrd, and at comparatively small cost. "It would, or course, bo very desirable if all our ships, when first completed, could bo turned over to the Government by contractor und by nny jnrds in absolutely perfoct condition, but this bus neter yet been done, cither in our own or niiy other nary. A modern war vessel is an aggregation of complicated machines, and no expert expects a ship to bo at its best until it hns been shaken down by a cruise of months and tried thoroughly In all Its parts. "It Is belloved that wo hao mado fewer than any nation, and certainly less costly mislnkes than tuostothers In the building of n modern navy, yet there wore two of our shlp. the Cos tine and tho Machlus, tbat had to be cut In two and lengthened. Thero were three others, the Detroit, the Montgomery, and tho Marhlehead. In which it was found essential to make far more fundamental changes thnn have eer been found necessary In tho 'lexus, anil jet the latter ship, probably because theque-tlon of her avail ability ns n nanl war esscl was inooml In the navy irotn tlio tery inception nf tlio shin, has been subject to nn unusual amount of harsh criticism. "Ills snmetimesstnted that there am naval officers who are stealthily and surreptitiously nidiug. through the preri, to Innu tno public condemn a w-sscl of the 1'nited Mates navy. Jf tnU wire true there would he no condemnation too strung and no punishment too severe for such conduct. "The Toxns ban bien cruising ns a part of tho North Atlantic squadron for the past four months, hlnce her bottom w a-. Mitfeneii at tho Norfolk Navy Yard. Copt. Gluts, one uf tlio most efficient nnd reliublo officers of thenaw, who has been in command of her declares that she is liht- stifiest, uiOht enMly managed nnd entirely seaworthy ship in the service, dipt. Robley D. Kvhiis. cotuuianding tho Indiana, holds the earn opinion. He mi) s thut whun the fleet, on the l"th of October, wa-. on its way tn New York, in a hurricane, in the worst tea he nod ever encountered, tho Icxhs showed that she was the most seaworthy ship In the fleet. Tho Indiana was Just ahead of thn Texas and just behind tho Maine, which Is the rivnl ship of the Texus. sho having been hullt npon tho plans uf tho latter alt.. red in the department. Tho Texns rolled only !1 degrees, while both tho Maine nnd Indiana wern rollli g very much more. Cnpt. Kwinseuis ttie rleasall tbe lime was a perfec gun platform, and he was Inn fair position to Judge of thn relative merits of tlio different ships. In that licet were, at that time, the New York', tho Indiana, the Columbia, tho Raleigh, tho Texas, tlio .Montgomery, and tho Maine, representing nil tho different classes of ships above L-uuhonts. now in tho navy of the I'nlted htntes. und ('apt. Kwins says that the Texas, in her seaworthy quutitles, wns fur supe rior to them nil. Admiral Bunco corroborates this statement. "This controversy nbout tho Texas bus brought out, naturally, from mining thu naval officers who uro ucqiininti-ii witli tho ehlpsome ery stout defenders, among others Admiral Brown, commandant at thu Nm folk Navy Yard, who knows more nbout her ttiun .iu one else except her Cuptnfn. Some slate mcfits by Ad miral Brown, which It appears from an inter view with him woromisunderntnod byreporlers, bnvecallid forth tho follow inglleltc- from Mr. Charles II.

Thu substance of these state ments isthat tho troubles of tho Texas arc hot duo to any defect in tho ship, but tun coiu piracy nuiung ptlvutu shipbuilders to discredit und de fninu her because sbu was hullt lu u uuvy yard.

Such was iny opinion of tho plans of the Texas then, and 1 hate never seen any reason to niter It. " 'Returning now to the alleged "conspiracy" against navy yards, 1 state emphatically that I hnvo never handled thn stibiect uf navyjard methods, except In public hearings beforo com mittees nnd once In the Washington 1'mt, mak ing no secret of my responsibility for tho publi cation. In this I did not attack tho quality of work done n navy yards, but produced areport which had been mndo by tho Navy Department for the House Commltlco on Appropriations showing that on tho basis of my bids to build the Raleigh and Cincinnati I would havo built three such ships for what those, tiro cost In thn navy yards, and I did this to meet and overthrow a combination I will not say "conspiracy" between tho New York. Norfolk, and Maro Island navy sards against tho contract svstom. At tho namo time I admitted this hlch cost was duo to the necessary red tnponnd mllltnrymeth ods Inseparable from nny nnd all attempts of tho Government to operate as a manufacturer. Apart from and be) ond thu foregoing con siderations I hnvo always and most strenuously deprecated public criticism nnd discussion of such matters, for tho reason that they are used oiiruad to handicap our industries In competi tion for foreign work. For example. LI Hung Chung nskod mo " Why iln thn South American leuubllcsgntnKngland for tholr ships?" nnd I learned that he was prompted to this inquiry b) tho (.hlnoso (Jovemmcnt In ennsequonce of the fact that both tho British nnd Uormun Mm isters to China hart called attention to the mat ter nnd had mid tho Chinese authorities thot it w?.!i.,,c,iuse Kno11 hM coul1 nnt uo built bore, ihuarmor-plnlo Investigation, the allega tions of defective stability, and many other puiilished criticisms on our ships hnvo been paraded by tho English nnd Germans In Japan, cmna, and Russia, nnd their substunco trans ""l and printed in nenspnpors thero to our prejiidico. 1'iirmoro serious faults prctnll in other navies, but they nro never known to tho public, because It Is policy t:prvent Ill-judged or misconceived criticism nf such affairs. This policy Is sound, because whatever mny bo tbo faults or defects they certainly cannot bo made good by printers' Ink, a conviction which I nm sure you shnro with me. ' 'In conclusion I remark that while I havo long deprecated this tendency without snylng much about It. I havo been provoked to this somewhat emphatic protest by the fact that Admiral Hrown, as quoted, seems to hnvo renched tho cllmnx of mistake and mischief. ' ?.'? "''Bectfully. Ciiaui.ks H. Champ.' I call particular nttentlnn to what Mr. Cramp says about the plans of tliu Texns. Tho very remarkable qualities, as a seagoing vcscl. she lias demonstrated certainly vindicate his Judg ment. I do not mean to assert thnt the Texas Is n model ship. Sho was laid down ten years ago. Many improvements have been made since that time in turret and watertight bulk head s) stems nnd also in the distribution of batteries. S bat I do mean to t-ay Is that tho I exas will prove hcrelft be a valuable naval ve.,V,As to B"' controversy between Ad mlral Blown and tho ship yards. I have di rected him not to talk for publication hereafter In relation to tho Texns. nnd it Is my earnest desire that ull naval officers shall pursue a sim ilar courso. "I especially desire to call attention to what Mr. Crump sa In bis letter about the effect In foreign countries of tho very frequi nt criticism upon American ships by a portion of the Ameri can press. I havo direct information from sources other than Mr. Cramp's levter which bears out his statements. Both Chlnn and Japnn are building navies. Our shiubuildurs naturally desire the custom of theso two coun Tv'".: ,, am ."edibly informed that certain shipbuilders of oilier countries, who were com petlng last spring with American shipbuilders for contracts with the Japanese (iovernmer.t. bad collected n large number of very sharp criticisms of American ships nnd put them all In array beforo the Japanese authorities for the purpose of showing that we do not know how to build ships in tills country. "Theprossnf the country has loen generally loyal to the navy, and has liccn largely Instru mental In Its successful shipbuilding and devel opment: its services in this direction cannot bo too heartily acknowledged. I submit Mr. Cramps letter, however, for tho purposo of pointing out to smut of our newspaper friends the unintentional injuries to American interests that aro liable to result from enlarging upon minor mistakes that may have been committed, oven though ut other times full credit be given for the great und substantial successes that have been attained. "As to the ml9tnt.es nf rival nations they enn as a rule only ho learned through strictly pro fessional channels. So thnt utir shipbuilders, when going abroad for custom, aro at a disad vantage when confronted by criticisms which certainly never were written w th the thought that tbev would be used for oil) such purpose. 1 am sure that those nhnrouluct aud control ?.r , ".'.,' "'"' '"'rci wit), mo that American shipbuilders I avo no superiors. "In making this statement lot me say that I do not Intend to be drawn into n controversy utout the Texas. I only wish to put tho public in possession of the most important facts about this ship, nnd 1 certnlnlydo not deny tho right nr duty of the press to crlticlce naval methods. The department has sometimes even bod its at tention profitably directed lo points In naval administration that might otherwise. In tho routine of business, have escajed attention, and whether it adopts them or not, it always wel comes suggestions which lire meant to be. as most of them arc. in tho Interests of the navy." .t ; .

Ono of the results of such a combination In case the sound-money Democrats capture the Legls- ' m laturo will be the election of a representative of ' , ,, tt that faction to tho United States Senate to sec- . ceud Mr. Daniel, whose terra expires two years & hence. im Tbo Republicans aro convinced by the result Is of the election In November that they can never I'M secure a fair vote and an honest count In Vlr- 'Is glnlu until tbe present election law Is repealed.

Tho color line Is H drawn only on local issues, howover, and thero would bo no objection to supporting a colored t man for Congress If be could secure a nomina- 9 tion in Virginia, which Is doubtful. Tbo Re. ; J publican lenders are anxious to conclude th.
