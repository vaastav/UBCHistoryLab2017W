I also call attention to tbe remarks soon the impro cement of the south Tass of the "Mississippi river ; the pro. posed free Driage over tne x-oiomaa river at Georgetown ; the importance of completing at an early day the north wins of the de partment building, and other recommenda tions of the Secretary of War, Which appear his report. The actual expenditures or the department for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1881. were S42.122.201.3S. The appropriations for the year 1882 were $44,- B8Sr,7zo.42. roe estimates ior 1000 bid qpti, 641,296.91. 7 HAVAT. AFFAIRS. The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the condition of that branch of the service, and presents valuable suggestions for its improvement I call your especial at tention, also, to the appendix of the report of the advisory board, which he convened to develop suitable measures for increasing the efficiency or tne navy ana particularly iuo mi as to the character and number of ves sels necessary to place it upon a footing com mensurate with the necessities or me govern ment. I cannot too strongly uree upon you my conviction - that every consideration of national safety, economy and honor impera- tivalir riAtnanri a thorouen renaDiuiauoii oi our navy. 'With a lull appreciation of the fact that compliance with the suggestions of the head of that department and of the ad visory board must involve a large expencu- tnrn of xrablio moneys. 1 earnestly recom mend such appropriations as will aceompnau an and which seems to me so desirable. Nothing can be more inconsistent with true public economy than withholding means nec essary to accompusn tne oojectB outrun, uj tha onnstitution to tne national leKimntuxo. One of those objects, and one which is of parttUlUUllb uiiWiwuiM'I " j fundamental law to oe a piuvmioix mi nnmmon defense." Surely nothing is more essential to the defense of the United States and of all our people than the efficiency of our navy. We have for many years maintained with Torsion governments the relations of honor able peace, and that such relations may be permanent is aesirea d.v every pwariunu om zen of the republic, but if we read the teachings of history we shall not forget that in the life of every nation emergencies may arise when a resort to arms can alone save it from dishonor. No danger from abroad now threatens this people, nor have we cause to distrust the friendly professions of other governments, but for avoiding as well as re pelling danger that may threaten us in the future we must be prepared to enforce any means which we think wise to adopt. We must be ready to defend our harbors against aggression ; to protect, by distribution of our Rhinn of war over the highways of com merce, the varied interests or our ioreign trade, and the persons and property of our citizens abroad ; to maintain everywhere the honor of our flag and the distinguished position which we may rightfully claim among the nations of the world. THK POSTAL 8EJ1VICE. The report of the Postmaster General is a Gratifying exhibit of the growtn ana emci- ency of the postal service. The receipts from postage and other ordinary sources dur ing the past fiscal year were $36,489,816.58 ; the receipts from the money order business were $295,581.39, making a total of $336,- 85.397.97. The expenditure for the fiscal year was ijioszoi, .. xno ueueit sup plied out of the general treasury was 2,401, 129.35. or 03 per cent, of the amount. The receipts $3,469,918.63 in excess of the pre vious year, and $4,878,397.97 in excess of the estimate made two years ago before the present period of business prosperity had fairlv beeun. The whole number or letters mailed m this country in the last fiscal year exceeded one thousand millions. ine registry system is reported to be in excellent condition, having been remodelled during the past four years with good results. The amount of registra tion fees collected during the last fiscal year was $712,882.20 an increase over the fiscal year ending June so, is8, of $345, 445.40. The entire number of letters and packages registered during the year was 8, 338,419, of which only 2,061 were loBt or de stroyed in transit. The operations of the money order system are multiplying yearly. Under the impulse of the rapid development of the newer Statesjand Territories, and the consequent demand for additional means of intercommunication and exohange during the past year, three hundred and thirty-eight additional money - order offices have been established, making a total of 5,499 in operation at the date - of this re port. During the year the domestic money orders aggregated in value S10i,075, 769.35. A modification of the system is suggested, reducing the fees for money orders not ex ceeding five dollars" from ten cents to five cents, and making the maximum limit $100 in place of $50. Legislation for the disposition of unclaimed money orders in tne possession of the Postoffice department is recommend ed, in view of the fact that their total value now exceeds one million dollars. The atten tion of Congress is again invited to the sub- iect of establishing a system of savings de positaries in connection with the Postoffice department. The statistics of mail transpor tation show that during the past year rail road routes have been increased in length 6, 249 miles, and in cost $1,114,382, while steamboat routes have decreased in length 2,182 miles, and in cost $134,054. The so called Star routes have been decreased in length 3,949 miles, and in cost $304,144. Nearly all the more expensive routes have been suspended by the railroad service. The cost of the Star service must therefore rap idly decrease in the western States and Terri tories. The Postmaster General, however. calls at tention to the continually increasing cost of the railway mail service as a serious difficulty in the way Of making tne department self sustaining. Our postal intercourse with for eign countries has kept pace with the growth of the domestic service. Within the past year several countries and color-as have de ciared their adnesion to the Jrostal union. It now includes all those which have an or ganized postal service, except Bolivia, Cos tanco. New Zealand and the British colonies in Australia. THE 

STAB EOUTES. As has been stated, great reductions have been made in the expense of the Star route service. The investigations of the Depart ment oi justice ana tne I'ostolhce depart ment have resulted in the presentation of in dictments against persons formerly connect ed with that service accusing them of of fenses against the United States. I have en joined the officials who are charged with the conduct ot tne cases on tne part of the gov ernment, and upon the eminent counsel who. before my accession to the Presidency, were called to their assistance' the duty of prose cuting with the utmost rigor of the law all persons who may be found chargeable with frauds upon tne postal service. - THB DEPARTMENT OP JUSTICE. The acting Attorney General calls atten tion to the necessity of modifying the pres ent system of courts of the United States, a necessity due to the large increase of busi ness, especially in the Supreme Court. Lit igation in our federal tribunal became great ly expanded after the close of the late war. So long as expansion might be attributed to the abnormal condition in. which the commu nity found itself immediately after the re turn of peace, prudence required that no change be made in the constitution of our judioial tribunals. But it has now become apparent that an immense increase of litiga tion has directly resulted from the wonderful growth, increase and development of the country. There is no ground for belief that the business of the United States courts will be less in volume than at present Indeed. that it is likely to be much greater is gener ally recognized by the bench and bar. In view of the fact that Congress has already given much consideration to this subfect. I make no suggestion as to detail, but express nope mat your deliberations may result in such legislation as will give early relief to our over-burdened courts. The acting At torney General also calls attention to the dis turbance of the public tranquillity during the past year in the Territory of Arizona, where a Dana or armea aesperaaoes Known as "cow boys," probably numbering from 60 to 100. have been engaged for months in committing acts of lawlessness and brutality which- the local authorities have been tumble to repress. The depredations of these "cowboys" have : also extended into Mexico, to which marauders escape from the Arizona frontier. With every disposition to meet the, exigencies of the case I am embar rassed by lack of authority to deal with them effectually. The punishment of crimes com mitted within Arizona should ordinarily, of course, be left to the territorial authorities, but it is worthy of consideration whether acts which necessarily tend to. embroil the United States with neighboring governments should not be declared crimes against the. United States. . Some of the- incursions al luded to may perhaps be within the scope of the law (section 5,zsb, .Revised (Statutes) for bidding military expeditions or enterprises against friendly states, but in view of the speedy assembling of your body I have pre ferred to await such legislation as in your wisdom the occasion may seem to requires It may, pernapa, do tnougnt proper to pro vide that the setting on foot within our own ; territory - of , . brigandage and armed marauding expeditions against friendly nations and their citizens shall be punishable as .an offense against the United States. I will add that in the event of a re- quest from the territorial government for pro ! taction by the United States against domestio violence this government would be powerless , to render assistance. The Act of 1 795, chap- : ter 36, passed at a time when Territorial gov- , ernments received little attention from Con- ; gress, enforced this dutj of the United States only as to state government, dot tne act oi 1807, chapter 89, applied also to territories. This law seemed to have remained in force until the revision of the statute when the provisions' for the territories was dropped. I am not advised whether this alteration was intentional or accidental, but, as it seems to me that the territories should be offered the protection which is accorded to States by the Constitation,I suggest legislation to that end. It seems to me, too, that whatever-, views may prevail as to the policy of recent legisla tion, by which the army has ceased to be a part of tbe posse oomitatus. an exception might well be made for permitting the mili tary to assist the civil authorities in enforcing the laws of the United States. This use of the army would not seem to be within the al leged evil against which that legislation was aimed. From the sparseness of the popula tion and other circumstances it is often quite impracticable to summon a civil posse in places where tne othcers of justioe require as sistance and where a military force is within easy reach. THE XOTEXtrOB 

DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, . with accompanying documents, . presents an elaborate account of the business of that de partment. - A summary of it would be too extended for this place. I ask your careful attention to the report itself. Prominent among the matters which challenge the atten tion of Congress at its present session is the management of our Indian affairs. "While this question has been a cause of trouble and embarrassment from the formation ' of the government, it is but recently that any effort has been made for its solution at once serious ly determined, consistent and promising suc- lt has been easier to resort to con venient make-shifts for the tiding of tem porary difficulties than to grapple with the great permanent problem, and accordingly the easier course has almost invariably been pursued. It was natural at a time when the national territory seemed almost illimitable, and containedmany millions of acres far out side the bounds of civilized settlements, that a policy should have been initiated " which, more than aught else has been the source or our Indian complications. I refer "of course to the policy of dealing with the various In dian tribes as separate nationalities, of rele gating them by treaty stipulations to the oc cupancy of immense reservations in the West, and of encouraging them to live a savage life undisturbed by any earn est and well directed efforts to bring them under the influences of civilization. The unsatisfactory results which have sprung from this policy are becoming apparent to alL As the white settlements have crowded the borders of the reservations, the Indians, sometimes contentedly and sometimes against their wills, have been transferred to other hunting grounds from . which they have again been dislodged, whenever their new found homes nave Deen descried by the ad venturous settlers. These removals, and tbe frontier collisions by which they have often been preceded, have led to frequent and dis astrous conflicts between the races. It is . profitless to discuss here which of them has been chiefly responsible for- the disturbances whose recital occupies so large a space upon the pages of our history. We have -to deal with the appalling fact that though thousands of lives have been sacrificed and hundreds' of millions of dollars expended in the attempt to solve the Indian problem, it has, until within the past ten years, seemed scarcely nearer a solution "than it was half a century ago ; but the government has been, cau tiously but steadily, feeling its way to the adoption of a policy which has already pro duced gratifying results, and which in my judgment is likely, if Congress and the Ex ecutive accord in its support, to relieve us ere long from the difficulties which have hitherto beset us. For the success of the efforts now making to introduce among the Indians the customs and pursuits of civilized life, and gradually to absorb them into the mass of our citizens, sharing their rights and holden to their re sponsibilities, there is imperative need for legislative action. My suggestions in that re gard will be chiefly such as have been already called to the attention of Congress and have received, to some extent, its consideration. First, I recommend the passage of an act making the laws of the various States and Territories applicable to the Indian reserva' tions within their borders, and extending the law's of the State of Arkansas to the portion of Indian Territory not occupied by the five civilized tribes. The Indian should receive the protection of the law ; he should be al lowed to maintain in court his rights of per son and property ; he has repeatedly begged for this privilege ; its exercise would be very valuable to him in his progress toward civili zation. Second, and of even greater impor tance, is a measure which has been frequently recommended by my predecessors in office, in furtherance of which several bills have been, from time to time, introduced in both houses of Congress the enactment of a general law permitting tbe allotment in seve ralty, to such Indians at least as desire it, of a reasonable quantity of land, secured to them by patent, and for their own protection made inalienable for twenty or twenty-five years. This is demanded for their present welfare and their permanent advancement. In return for such considerate action on the part of the government, there is reason to believe that the Indians in large numbers would be persuaded to engage at once in in dustrial pursuits, knowing that their tribal days are over and that it is now for their best interests to conform their manner of life to the new order of things. By no greater in ducement than the assurance of a permanent title to the soil can they be led to engage in the occupation of tilling it. The well-attested reports of their increasing interest in hus bandry justify the hope and belief that the enactment of such a statute as I recommend would be at once attended with gratifying re sults. A resort to" the allotment system would have a direct and powerful influence in dissolving the tribal band which is so prominent a feature of savage life, and tends so strongly to perpetuate it. Third, I advise a liberal appropriation for the support of Indian schools, because of my confidence and belief that that course is consistent with useful economy. Among the most uncultivated Indian tribes there is reported to be a general and urgent desire on the part of the chiefs and older members for the education of their children. It is an unfortunate instance of this fact that during the past year the means which have been at the command of the Interior department for the purpose of Indian instruction have proved to be utterly inadequate. The success of the schoolswhich are in operation at Hampton, Carlisleand Forest Grove should not only encourage a more generous provision for the. support of those institutions, but should prompt the establishment of others of a similar character. They are doubtless much more potent for good than the day schools on the reservation, as the pupils are separat ed from the surroundings of savage life and brought into constant contact with civiliza tion. There are many other phases of this sub ject which are of great interest, but which cannot be included within the becoming limits of this communication. They are dis cussed ably in the reports .of the Secretary of the interior and the Commissioner of In dian Affairs. THB 

MOBMONB. For many years the Executive in his annu al message to Congress has urged the neces sity of stringent legislation for the suppres sion of polygamy in the territories, and especially in the Territory of Utah. The existing statute for the punishment ef this odious crime, so revolting to the moral and religious sense of Christendom, has been persistently and contemptuously violated ever since Us enactment. Indeed, in spite of th commendable efforts on the part of the authorities who represent the United States in that Territory, the law has in very rare instances been enforced, and for a cause to which reference will presently be made is practically a dead letter. The fact that the adherents of the Mormon church, which rests upon polygamy as its corner stone, have recently been peopling in large numbers in Idaho, Arizona and other of our 'Western Territories, is well calculated to excite the liveliest interest and apprehension. It imposes upon Congress and the Executive the duty of using against this barbarous system all the power which, under the Constitution and law, they can - wield for its destruction. . Beference has been already made to the obstacles which the United States officers, have encountered in their efforts to punish violations of law. Prominent among the ob stacles is tbe difficulty of procuring legal evi dence sufficient to warrant a conviction, even in the case of the most. notorious offenders. Your attention is called to a recent opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, explaining its judgment' of reversal in the case of Miles, who - had' been convicted of bigamy in Utah. The court refers to the fact that the secrecy attending the celebra tion of marriage in that Territory makes the proof of polygamy very difficult, and the propriety is suggested of a change in the law of evidence which now makes : a wife incompetent to testify against her husband. ; This suggestion is approved.' ; I recommend also the passage of an act providing that in the Territories of the United States the fact that a woman has been married to a person charged with bigamy shall not disqualify her as witness upon bis trial for that offense. I further recommend legislation by which any persons solemnizing marriage in any of the Territories shall be required, under stringent penalties for neg lect or refusal, to file a certificate of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Terri tory.. If Congress may devise other practi cable measures for obviating the difficulties which bare hitherto attended the efforts to suppress ims iniquity, a assure you or my determined purpose to co-operate with you in any lawful and discreet measures which may be proposed to that end. PUBLIC XDUOATION. Although our system of government does not contemplate that the nation should pro vide or support a system for the education of our people, no measures calculated to pro mote that general intelligence and virtue upon which the perpetuity of our institu tions so greatly depends have ever been re garded with indifference by Congress or the Executive. A large portion of the public do main has been-, from time to time, devoted to the promotion of education. There is now a , special reason why, by setting apart the pro- ceeds of its sales of public lands, or by some other course, the government should aid the work of education. . Slany who now exercise . the right of suffrage are unable to read the ballot which they cast. . Upon many who had I just emerged from a condition of slavery , were suddenly devolved the. responsibilities of citizenship in that portion of the country I most impoverished by war. I 'have been 1 pleased to learn from the report of the Com . missioner of Education that there has been : lately a commendable increase of interest and , effort for their instruction, but all that can i be done by local legislation and private gen- erosity should be supplemented by such aid l as can be constitutionally afforded by the national government. I would suggest that jf any funa be dedicated to this purppse it may be wisely distributed in the different States, according to the ratio of illiteracy, as , by those means those locations which are ' most in need of such assistance will reap its especial benents. AGBiCUX,TUBK. I , The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture exmoiia me xeauii. ox me experiment in waica uih department has been engaged daring the pest year. and makes important suggestions in reference to the agricultural development of the country. The steady increase of oar population, and the consequent ad dition to the number of those engaged in the pursuit of husbandry, are giving to this department a grow ing dignity and importance. The Commissioner's suggestions touching its capacity for greater useiul . neas. deserve attention, as it more and more com mends itself to the interest which it was created to promote. FUSIONS. it appears from the report of the CommlssioneB of Pensions that since 1860 789,063 original pension clainis have been filed ; 460,949 of these have been al lowed and inscribed on the pension rolls ; 72,639 have been reported and abandoned, being 13.6 plus per oent. of the whole number of claims settled. There are now pen din? for settlement 266.575 orisical pen sion claims. 237,040 of which were hied prior to July 1, 1880. These, when allowed, will Involve the pay ment of arrears from the date of discharge in case of an invalid, and from the date of death or termination of a prior right in all other oases. From all the data obtainable it is estimated that nlteen per cent, oz tne number of claims now pending will be rejected or abandoned. This would show the probable rejectl n of 34.040 cases and the probable admission of about 193,000 claims, all of which involve the payment of arrears of pensions With the present foroe em ployed, the number of adjudications remaining tbe same and no new business intervening, this number of claims (193,000) could be acted upon In a period of six years; and taking January 1st, 1884, as a near period from which the estimate ii based on the aver age amount of arrears, it is found that every case allowed ' would require fo the first paymettt the sum of $1,350. Multiplying this amount by the whole number of probable ad missions elves 250.000.00 as the sum required for first payments.. This represents the sum which must be paid upon claims which were filed before July 1, 1880, and are now pending and entitled to the benefits of the arrears act. From this amount $250,000,000 may be deducted, from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 for cases where the claimant dying there is no person who under the law would be entitled to succeed to the pension, leaving $235,000,000 as the probable amount to be paid, in these estimates no ao oount has been taken of the 38.500 cases filed. since June 30, 1880, and now pending, which must re ceive attention as current business, but which do not involve the payment of any arrears beyond the date of filing the clalmB. or this number it is esti mated that eiffhtv-six per cent, will be allowed. It has been stated that with the present force of the pension bnreau (625 clerks) it is estimated that it will take six years to aispose ox tne claims now penning. It is stated by tbe Commissioner of Pensions that by an addition of 250 clerks (increasing the adjudicating force rather than the mechaxtical) double the amount of work could be accomplished, so that these cases oould be acted upon within three years. Aside from the considerations of justice which may be urged for a speedy settlement of the claims now on the files of the pension office, it is not less important on the score of economy, inasmuch as fully one-third of the clerical force of the office is now wholly occupied in attention to correspondence with the thousands of claimants whose cases have been on the files for the last eighteen years. The fact that a sum so enor mous may be expended by the government to meet the demands for arrears of pensions is an admonition to Conaress and the Executive to crive cautious con sideration to any similar project in the future. 3 he great temptation to present fictitious claims afforded by the fact that the average sum obligated pon each application is $13,000 leads me to suggest the proprie ty of making some special appropriation for the pre vention of fraud. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. I ad vis e appropriations for such internal Improve ments as-the wisdom of Congress may deem to be necessary and of public importance. The necessity of imrrrovinc- the navigation of the Mississippi river Justifies a special allusion to that subjeet. I suggest the adoption of some measure for the removal of ob structions which now impede the na igition ox tnai. great channel ox commerce. THE CIVXI, SERVICE. In my letter accepting the nomination for the Vice Presidency I stated that in my judgment no man should be an incumbent of an office the duties of which he is for any cause unfit to perform, who is lackinct in the ability, fidelity or integrity which proper administration of such office demands. This sentiment would doubtless meet with general acqui escence but opinion has been widely divided upon the wisdom and the practicability of tae vari ous reformatory schemes which have been suraested and of certain proposed regulations governing appointments to public office. The effi ciency of such regulations has been distrusted main ly because they have seemed to exalt mere education and -'abstract tests above general business capacity and even special fitness for the particular worx in hand. It memi to me that the rulB which should be applied to the management of the public service may proporly conform in the main to such as regulate the conduct of successful private business. Original appointments should be based on ascertained fitness. Positions of responsibility should, so far as practica ble, be filled by the promotion of worthy and efficient officers. The investigation of all claimants and the punishment of all official misconduct should be prompt and thorough. The views expressed in the foregoing letter are those which will govern my ad ministration of the executive office. They are doubt less shared by all intelligent and patriotic citizens, however divergent in their opinions as to the best methods of putting them into practical operation For example, the assertion that oginal appoint ments should be based upon ascertained fitnsss is not open to dispute, but the question how in practice such fitness can be most effectually ascertained has for years excited interest and discussion. The measure which, wltn slight variations in its details. has lately been urged upon the attention of Congress and the Executive, has as its -principal feat ure a scheme of competitive examination. Save for certain exceptions which nee 3 not be - specified, this plan would . give admission to the service only in its lowest grade and would accordingly demand that all vacancies in higher osltions should be filled by promotion. In these particulars it is in conformity with the existing civil service system of Great Britain, snd indeed the success which has attended that system in the coun try of its birth is the strongest argument which has been urged for its adoption here. The fact should not, however, be overlooked that there are certain features of the English system which have not gene rally been received with favor in this country, eveu among the foremost advocates of civil service reform Among them are : First, a tenure of office which is substantially a life tenure ; second, a limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant can enter the service, whereby all men in middle life or older are. with some exceptions rigidly excluded ; third, a retiring allowance upon going out of office. These three elements are as important factors of the problem as any of the others. To elim inate them from the English system would effect a most radical cnange in its tneory and practice. Continuing his remarks upon the subject of the civ il service the President expresses doubt whether it would be for the best interests of the public to fix upon an expedient for immediate extensive applica tion which -embraces certain features of the English system but excludes or ignores others of equal im portance.' He calls attention to the defects of com petitive examinations, and also to the defects of rigid system of promotion. He points out that the work or correcting the evils complained ox must be gradual, ana says : "it may be tnac before we confine ourselves upon this important question with in the stringent bounds of a statutory enactment we may profitably await the result of further inquiry and experiment. He suggests that the submission of a portion of the nominations to a central board of ex aminers, selected solely for testing the qualifications of applicants, may perhaps, without resort to a com petitive teitjrot an end to the mischief which attends tne present system ox appointment, ana it may be forcible -to vest in such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the characteris tics and attainments of candidates. He thinks that a majority of the employes of the government do tneir duty in a manner deserving or high commenda tion. Concerning the deplorable condition of our mer chant marine, he thinks that if we had given to our navigation interests a portion of the aid and pro tec tin which have been so wisely bestowed upon our manufacturers the former would now be In better condition. He recommends legislation concerning ths super vision and transitory care of immigrants at the ports ox .ae oar jcation. He recommends giving Alaska such a form of gov ernment as will promote the education of the people and secure the administration of justice. He gives attention to the need of a building for the library of Congress, and to the need of doing some thing to make the Potomac marshes less unhealthy for the people of Washington. . Other District im provements, are also spoken of. He urges that something be done before another presidential election about tne electoral count. The concluding portion of the message is as follows : P 

RESIDENTIAL DISABILITY. Questions which concern the very existence of the government ana tne uoercies ox tne peopte were sug gested by the prolonged illness of the late President, and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions of his oflta. It to provided by the second article of the Constitu tion, in tne nrtn clause oi iw nrst section, tnat in case ef the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall de volve on the Vice President. What is the interpreta tion of the Constitution of its specification of "inabil ity to discharge the powers asd duties of said office as one of the contingencies which calls the Vice President to the exercise of the Presdential functions? Is the inability limited in its nature to long contin ued intellectual incapacity, or has it a broader im port T What must be its extent and duration T How must its existence be established ? Has the President whose -inability is the subject of inquiry any voice in determining whether or not it exists T Or is the de cision of that momentous and delicate question con fided to the Vice President? Or is it contemplated by the Constitution that Congress should provide by a law precisely what should constitute inabili ty and how and by " what tribunal or authority it should be ascertained ? If the inabil ity proves to be temporary in its nature, and during its continuance the Vice President lawfully exercises the functions of the Executive, by what tenure does he hold his office ? Does he continue as President for the remainder of the four years term ? Or would the elected President, if his inability should cease in' the interval, be empowered to resume his office, and if having s-ich lawful authority lie should exercise it would the Vice President be thereupon empowered to resume his powers and duties as usual ? I cannot doubt that these Important questions will receive your early and thoughtful consideration. Deeply impressed with the gravity of the responsi bilities which have so unexpectedly devolved upon me, it will be my constant purpose to co-operate with you In such measures as will promote the glory of the country and the prosperity of its people.
