Large "Permanent Annual Appropriations" SYSTEHI WHICH NEEDS REVISION. Many Financiers Doubt the Wisdom of the Pres ent Method, Which Is Misleading, From the Fact That Many of the Appropriations Set Aside Are Never Paid Out=-Reed in Favor of Annexation. Special to the Globe. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.— The "per manent annual appropriations" intro duce an element of some confusion into discussions of the expenditures of the United States government. It is a sin gular fact that this designation in cludes obligations of the government which are a preferred claim over ev erything else,' like the interest on the public debt, the disbursement of trust funds and the expenses of collecting the revenue, while, on the other hand, ; it regularly includes at least one very large item— that of the sinking fund— which has "not been paid for several years. Thus the "permanent annuals" j range from the obligations "first paid" I in order of preference to those "last j paid," or never paid. The "billion-dol lar congress" notion comes from in ' eluding all of the "permanent" with j the regular appropriations, and unless ! the "permanents" are fully paid there is an element of error in speaking of our expenditures as $500,000,000 a year. The sinking fund requirement is at the bottom of most of the misunderstand ings of this kind. The sum appropriat ed permanently for this purpose now amounts to $51,000,000 a year, and of course is paid only when there is a surplus. This amount is made up, by law, of 1 per cent of the debt out standing, including the non-interest bearing or greenback issue, and one year's Interest on the bonds that have already been redeemed for this fund. One per cent of the public debt is now about $10,000,000, while the annual in terest charge on the bonds redeemed under the operation of the law amounts to $41,000,000. As the 1 per cent of the debt goes down, the interest item in this calculation goes vp — the Intention of the framers of the law evidently be ing to provide that, the smaller the debt became the faster it should be paid. The permanent annual appropri ations also contain a $10,000,000 item known as the national bank redemption fund, which is not a legitimate expendi ture of the government, but merely a method of bookkeeping. There is some doubt as to whether the system of permanent annual ap propriations is wise. Many financiers believe that congress should each year go over the entire appropriations, and certainly, if this was done, the subject would be somewhat simplified for the ordinary student of government af fairs. As it is now, to get at the run ning expenses of the government, the regular appropriations must be added to the permanent annual, and from their sum must be subtracted those charges which the government does not pay except when there is a surplus revenue. Three permanent annual appropria tions are designated as "specific," and the rest as "indefinite." The former are (1) for the Smithsonian institution (interest derived from bequest of James Smithson and others); (2) for the expenses of collecting the revenue from customs, and (3) for arms, ord nance stores, etc., for issue to the mi litia. These will amount for this fiscal year to $5,954,720. The indefinite part of the "permanent annual" appropriations include: Allowance to consular officers, who are naid in whole or in part by fees for services neces sarily rendered to American vessels and sea men, as provided by act of June 26 18S4 Salaries for consular and diplomatic 'offi cers for periods occupied necessarily in re ceiving instructions, and in making "transits availabl " ™Bn\ar salary would not be The sinking fund, already described Interest on the public debt. Interest on Pacific Railway stock Salaries and contingent expenses of steam boat inspectors. Cost of transporting and assorting national bank notes. Sinking fund of Pacific railroads. National bank note redemption account. Expenses of treasury notes, under the act Coinage 'of silver bullion. Allowance or drawback on articles on which any internal revenue duty or tax shall have been paid when said articles are exported , refl !, nd any P** back taxes erroneously or Illegally assessed or collected under tho internal revenue laws. Redemption of spoiled stamps. Refund of direct tax levied under act of Aug. 5, 1861. Marine hospital establishment, from money collected from tonnage duties. Sums received from fines, etc, in revenue service, for collecting revenue from customs Expenses of regulating immigration. The list here has here been carried far enough for purposes of illustration. As a general rule, it will be observed that moneys which the government re ceives from fees or charges for an ex plicit purpose are thus appropriated under the act of congress determining such use. Also, those debts of the gov ernment which are in a high degree ob ligations of honor, and about which there should never be any question, are included. The instances where the government merely acts as a disburs ing agent or as the custodian of a trust fund also constitutes quite a part. For the present financial year, it Is the present financial year, It ent annual appropriations will re quire $120,078,220. The amount actually paid under these appropria tions in the last fiscal year for which the returns are fully made up, was $73,153,780. The sinking fund explains . the difference. There is some impropriety in speak ing of money paid to the sinking-fund as an expend iture.ln private life a man would not consider that part of his in come which he applied to the cancel'a tion of old debts as belonging to his current expenses, but rather as a form of savings. Thus the expenditures in a year when nothing goes to the. sink ing-fund give a more correct idea of what it costs to run the United States government, and for the last four years these sums have been as follows: IS9J $337,r.25.f<tt|189fi 352,179,000 1895 356.195.00 i) 1 1597 36*>,774.000 Another occasion of some confusion is the postoffice appropriations. In making up a "billion-dollar congress" record it is necessary to add the full amount appropriated for the conduct of the postal business, rather than the de- flake It Certain. ficit from its operations, which is the government's real expense. It has be come the practice of late to charge to the postoffice only its deficits, and that is the more straightforward way. 

REED WOULD ANNEX If the Hoane I» Called Upon to Act. Special to the Globe. WASHINGTON, Dec. B.— The pro posed annexation of Hawaii consti tutes the principal topic of conver sation in all gatherings of states men. It will soon be officially project ed upon the arena of the United States senate. Speaker Reed will heartily co operate with the friends of annexation, if action by the house of representa tives should become necessary. A prominent member of the senate committee on forign relations, who de clines to permit the use of his name, this evening said to ycur correspondent: "You have been here long enough to know that senators are practically pro hibited from talking about the affaiis of their committees, especially on topics which will receive consideration in executive session. But, I can give you some facts which you can use in your own way, with discretion, and without making use of my name. "The opponents of annexation will do a lot of talking. The people will be come restive and tired. Public senti mt nt will compel the senate to reach a vote on the subject. The friends of annexation will not do much talking. They will leave time-killing talk to the opponents of the project. A vote should be taken before the Christmas holidays; but it may not be taken until some time in January. "So far as I have been able to ascer tain, two-thirds of the senators are not in favor of annexation. You know it requires a two-thirds vote to ratify a treaty of that character. Thirty sena torial votes in the negative, would be sufficient to reject the treaty of annex ation. I believe that there are at lea--t thirty senators who wil vote in the negative. We who favor annexation realize the sincerity and patriotism of those who oppose the treaty. But when the treaty is rejected, as I now believe that it will be, the subject will still be open; and I am confident that annexation is simply a question of a little time." "But, if the senate rejects the treaty, what, can be done?" "A great many things can be done. In the first place, a bill providing for annexation of Hawaii can be pass ed by both houses of congress, by a majority. There is no doubt that a clear majority of both houses will fa vor annexation. Of course, such a bill might be long delayed in the sen ate, by the speeches of the opponents of annexation. Everybody realizes that. But, sooner or later, a vote will be had, and the annexation bill can be passed." "But suppose you cannot pass such a bill?" "Then something else would happen. You will remember that there was a disturbance in Hawaii three pears ago. and the flag of this country was run up at Honolulu, and a temporary pro tectorate was established, for the ben efit of citizens of the United States, residing in that country. The same thing might happen again." "Please explain your meaning." "Well, the president of the United States earnestly desires the annexa tion of Hawaii. The president of Ha waii earnestly desires to have this country annexed to the United States. In the event of failure by treaty or by legislation, to accomplish that ob ject, it would be very easy to have disturbances on the islands, which would result in an appeal by the pres ident of Hawaii, to the commander of one of our naval vessels, to run up the flag agaip, for the purpose of pro tecting the interests of our citizens there. If the flag ever goes up again on Hawaiian soil, public sentiment will compel action; and the flag would never be hauled down. Hawaii would thus come under the protectorate of this country. Our people would never allow the islands to go under the pro tectorate of any other country. You see there are many ways of accom plishing things in the world of diplo macy. The friends of annexation may be wrong, but they are In the major ity, and will accomplish their object, one way or another." —Smith D. Fry. -mm- , 

LEGALLY DEAD. Oild Claim by tlie Attorney of a Pennsylvania Murderer. PITTSBURG, Dec. B.— The execution of the negro, Phillip Hill, which was set for today, has been postponed in definitely. Failing to .hear favorably from Gov. Hastings upon the applica tion of Hill's mother for a respite, his attorneys took out a writ of error to the supreme court this morning and the execution was postponed. Hill was convicted of the murder of George Lawrence, a railroad labor boss. The postponement of the execution and the developments in the case have caused a sensation in legal circles. George H. Kane, one of the young \ members of the bar who acted as Hill's counsel, is supported by several | judges of the county' courts as well as by many of the leading attorneys. j Mr. Kane t,ays: Philip Hill is legally I dead; we shall ask for a writ of habeas | corpus to have his body turned over I to his friends, and if necessary will j take the case through the supreme i court of the United States. The writ I of error, as we notified Gov. Hastings, I should never have acted as a super- I cedas or stay of execution under the act of 1897. and he is regarded by tho I law as I see it as dead." The postponement of an execution ! by writ of error is something unheard of in the history of this state before. It Is almost exactly a parallel case to that of Theodore Durrant, the San Francisco murderer, whose execution was prevented by the same sort of an application, but according to the laws of California the sheriff can fix the date for the hanging himself after wards. THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1897. Spanish Press Demands That the Yankees Be Taught a Lesson. WADRID, Dec. B.— The premier, Senor Sagasta, in an inter view regarding President Mc • Kinley's message tp congress, is quoted as saying he thinks the mes sage satisfactory, "because the threat to intervene In Cuba was made mere ly to give satisfaction to a portion of American opinion, without the in tention of executing it." Continuing, the premier said the government would not make a de claration on the subject. He be • lleved the president's words would have influence with the insurgents, and added that the cortes would not be convened until the government had ascertained the effect of the message upon the United States con gress. The Imperial, commenting on the message, says: "It shows a certain cleverness and evil Intention when it refers to filibustering expeditious. McKinley speaks with what appears to be excessive cynicism to those who have not lost all notion of jus tice. This government must snow the Yankees that the Spanish flag floats over Cuba, and that they have yet to tear it down." La Correspondencia de Espana, the official organ, says that alter reflec tion, Spanish opinion on President McKinley's message to congress ls less optimistic than at first. It pro ceeds to impugn the sincerity of the president's protestation of friend ship for Spain and of respect for in ternational obligation, but it admits that the message was "addressed to congress principally and iv language which, though not Intended to please Spain will annoy jingoes and fili busters." 

LIVIJJG, BUT THAT IS ALL. CANTON, 0., Dec. 9 (1:30 a. m.)— A sinking spell near midnight left Mother McKinley in a much weaker condition. She is again unconscious. The presi dent is still by her bedside. CANTON, 0., Dec. B.— All day tho children of Mrs. Nancy Allison Mc- Kinley were near her bedside watch ing for indications of hopeful change. They were disappointed. There was no ray of light on the face which betok ened returning consciousness. She has been lying in lethargic repose as if in sleep most of the time. She is gradual ly, but surely, growing thinner. Abner McKinley says the family are hoping against hope that she may show a better condition, but her state during the day had been such th_.t the watch ers think the end is gradually drawing near. The doctor saw the patient early this evening. He said he could not see ma terial change, but the weakening pro cess continues steadily. He is prepared for dissolution at any moment, but at the time of this visit he had not aban doned hope that she would continue in life during the night, and possibly longer. Members of the family at the same hour did not seem to be so hope ful. They have been more constantly at the bedside during the illness, and to them the steadily increasing weak ness all day was more apparent than to the doctor. Charles R. Miller, who has been almost constantly at the house, said that he had not previous ly noted such continued weakness as was noted during today. This was also accompanied by a higher temperature, and he could scarcely hope that the patient would live beyond midnight. He further said the others of the rela tives felt fully as apprehensive. The president is almost constantly at the bedside, refusing to be relieved by others and to take the rest and ex ercise he should. While it has been a matter the president has declined to discuss or to give any Information about to his friends and impossible for the reporters to secure any informa tion upon it, it is believed from the in dications at the postoffice and the tele graph office that he is receiving numer ous congratulations from the people of the country on his message to congress.

Japanese Views Regarding Hawaiian Annexation Unchanged, OMAHA, Neb., Dec. B— Toru Hoshi, Japanese minister to the United States, passed through Omaha this evening en route to Washington, accompanied by his private secretary. In an in terview with a reporter of the As sociated Press, Mr. Hoshl admitted that the object of his mission to Japan was to ascertain the views of his government on the proposed annexation of Hawaii, and to pro cure Instructions from the mikado relative to the course he was ex pected to pursue in case the treaty shall be ratified by congress. "The impression has gone out to the American press," said Mr. Hoshi, "that we propose to recall the protest entered by Japan against the acquisition of the Sandwich Islands by the United States government. This is misleading and untrue. Japan has always maintained amicable re lations with the United States, and it is not our purpose now to take any steps that would lead to a breach of mutual good will, but at the same time Japan will stand firm ly in the maintenance of Its rights and privileges acquired under treaty with the Hawaiian government. If the United States decides to annex Hawaii, we hope to be able to en force our terms for Indemnity for the violation of treaty rights In tho expulsion of Japanese Immigrants from the islands and their exclusion from the right acquired under our treaty." vented the people from making mani festations of their congratulations. During the evening Mother McKin ley again aroused from her sleep. She lay quietly and restfully on her bed, the president at her side watching in tently and hopefully for some sign of recognition. The awakening, however, was not accompanied by any appre ciable rally. This was the condition at 11:30 o'clock. Up to that hour the patient remained in the deep sleep in which she reposed all day. When the doctor made his last Ci.ll, finding her in this sleep, he thought she would live until morning. She was still growing weaker, but so slowly that unless a material change came her strength would hold out during the night. MR.

Kaiser Given Possession of the Coaling Sta* tion Seized by His Fleet. FRANCE PREPARING TO INTERVENE. A Naval Force to Be Hurried to the Orient by President Faure. Prince Henry, of Prussia Visits Bismarck Before Proceeding to His Station. BERLIN, Dec. B.— lt is rumored to night that China ha 3 ceded Kiao-Chau to Germany. Whether the report be true or not. there i 3 every indication in the preparations for the expedition under Prince Henry that a long stay is contemplated. Emperor William will make the departure of Prince Henry's squadron from Kiel the occasion for an imposing naval display. The Bran denburg, a first-class battleship of more than 10,000 tons displacement, and the Wurtemburg, a second-class battle ship of nearly 7,500 tons, while coming from Christiana to Kiel to take part In the display, collided. Both vessels were injured, the Wurtemburg so bad ly that It was necessary to send her to dry dock. Prince Henry of Prussia, commander of the second squadron of German war ships bound for Kiao-Chau bay, visited Prince Bismarck and remained two hours in consultation with the great statesman. It is understood that the far Eastern situation was thoroughly discussed. On leaving Prince Bis marck, Prince Henry said: "Let me also salute that brow which my grand father so often kissed."

STRIKE. Ten Per Cent Cut in the Wages of Thirty Thousand Cotton Spinners. FALL RIVER, Mass., Dec. B.— At a general meeting of the cotton manufac turers today it was voted unanimaus ly to reduce wages in the mills of the city, the amount and time of the re duction being left to a committee which for some time has had charge of the matter. It is understood that the cut will be not less than 10 per cent and that It will go into effect on Jan. 1. The cut will affect 28.000 operatives who are paid an aggregate weekly wage of $180,000. For some months the executive committee of the association has been investigating the situation in this city. The price of print cloths for a long time has been the lowest in the history of the trade, while the de mand has been only fair. Under these conditions the mills have been selling at a loss, and the stock of goods has been increasing. The committee ob tained the signature of every manufac turer in the city, except one, who is understood to be D. A. Brayton, of the Durfee mill, a private corporation. As no reduction could be ordered without the consent of every mill, the commit tee decided to report back to the as sociation. This was done at the gen eral meeting today, and the committee received the unanimous approval of the association upon its suggestion that a reduction be made. It is anticipated that the price of weaving a cut of print cloth will be reduced from 18 to 16 cents. In August, 1894, a cut of 10 per cent was ordered, but in April of the next year an advance by the Fall CHURCH MISSIONS. The Annual Meeting of the Ameri can Soieietj*. PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. B— The an nual meeting of the American Church Mis sionary society was held here this aft'-rnoon. Gen. Wager Swayne, U. S. A., the president of the society, presided. Bishop Peterson made the opening prayer. Rev. J. Thompson Cole, general secretary, New York, submit ted the report of the executive committee. It stated in part: "The apparent loss to the society from the misconduct of Its late treas urer has been once more Increased by the amount of $6,893.65, tho principal of a second mortgage, which was given by him to the society and which a forced sale under the first mortgage has extinguished. The income on the Ely fund of $20,000 has been for many years devoted to Griswold college. lowa. In compliance with the terms of the deed, the committee have withheld the income for a year and appropriated it to the theological seminary of Virginia. The society has re ceived during the year $7,614 in special con tributions for church bui!ding in Brazil." Addresses were made by Bishop Peterson, Bishop Whitaker and Rev. W. C. Brown on the work of the society. The election of officers resulted in the choice of Gen. Wager Swayne as president. Among the honorary vice presidents are: Bishop H. R. Whipple, Minnesota; W. 11.
