"To the Senate and House of Repre? sentatives : "At the threshold of your deliberations you are called to mourn with your coun? try mCa the death of Vice President Ho bart, who passed from this life on the morning of November 21st last. His great soul now rests in eternal peace. His private life was pure and elevated, while his public career was ever distin? guished by large capacity, stainless integ? rity, and exalted motives. He has been removed from the high otfice which he honored and dignified, but his lofty char? acter, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose, and noble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and example. 

CONDITION OF PROSPERITY. "The Fifty-Sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with the country in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will among the people at home and in relations of peace and friend? ship with every government of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown a great increase in. olume and value. The com? bined imports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single year it all our history. Our exports for 1899 alone exceeded by more than a mill? ion <tetX&& our imports and exports com? bined in 1870. The imports per capita are twenty per cent. less than in 1870, while the exports per capita are 58 per cent, more than in 1870, showing the en? larged capacity of the United States to satisfy fhe wants of its own increased population as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. "The exports of agricultural products were $784,776,142. Of manufactured products we exported in value $339,592, 146, being larger than in any previous year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad, were 1898 and 1899. "Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, including $11,798,314.14, part payment of the Central Pacific railroad indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.45. Custom re? ceipts were $206,128,481.75, and those from internal revenue 1273,438,161.51. "For the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,564.02, leaving a deficit of 189,111,556.67. _Ibft President then proceeded to treat of tBe following subjects : 

TREASURY ESTIMATES. Under this head he gives the estimates of the receipts for the current fiscal year at $640,958,112. Refers to the present strong position of the Treasury, with respect to the cash an hand, speaks of the recent pur? chase of Government bonds as a success? ful operation. TUE NATIONAL 

CURRENCY. The President refers to the national bank act and ur ; that national banks be authorized to organize with a capital of $25,000. The President stands squarely for main? taining the gold standard, and asks that necessary legislation be enacted to give the Secretary of the Treasury means for main, turning the gold standard and parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and silver. He says : "The financial^ transactions of the government are con? ducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we eel! United States bonds and use gold for their payment." 

QUESTION OX TRU8TS. The President next discusses the ques? tion of trusts, on which he says : "Combinatians of capital organized into trusltjL control the conditions of trade atno?gour citizens, to stifle competition, limit production and determine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, are justly provoking public discus? sion, and should early claim the attention of tbe Congress. "The Industrial Commission, created by tbe act of Congress of June 18, 189S, has been engaged in extended hearings upon tbe disputed questions inv^yed in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their investigation of this subject and the conclusions and recom? mendations at which they may arrive are undetermined. "Tbe subject is one giving rise, to many divergent views as to the nature and va? riety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may result from large combinations concentrating more or less numerous enterprises and establishments, which previously to the formation of the combination were carried on separately. "It iB universally conceded that combi? nations which engross or control the mar? ket of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnr-' is not only to tbe common law but aL? iO the public welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If the present law can be extended more certainly to control oi check these monopolies or trusts, it should Define without delay. Whatever power the Congress possesses over this most impor? tant subject should be promptly ascertain ei and asserted." The message then treats of a number of other subjects. Among tbe most impoi teat are: Our Foreign Relations, The Nicaragua Canal, Relations with Germany, Canada and Great Britain, The Peace Conference, Army and Navy, The Philip? pines, The Sulu Islands, Hawaii an? Porto Rico. In speaking of the future of the Philip? pines the President Hays : 

FCTUKEOK THE PHILIPPIHU. "The future government of the Philip? pines rests with the Congress of the United States. Few graver responsibilities have ever been confined to us. If we accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and our traditions, a great opportunity conies with them. The islands he under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. We fling them a golden apple of discoid, among ttie rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them unqestioned. Their rich plains and valleys would be the Bcene of endless strife and bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila Bay instead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress, will have been the beginning ofaneraof misery and violence worse than any which has darkened their un? happy past." ? THANKSGIVING AT TAZEWELL. How It Was Observed By the Churches and People. Last Thursday was a bright and beauti f il day, tiie weather entirely in keeping with the abundant blessings that had been showered upon our country and our com? munity during the preceding year. The people seemed to be, from the appearance of their countenances, happy and truly thankful for their present condition. Most of the business houses of toe town closed their doors, at 10 o'clock in the morning and left them closed until 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At 11 o'clock, a. in. union services were . held at the Christian church, in which Rev. Willis L. Wuyts, of the Baptist , Church, Rev. J. S. French, of the Metho diet Church, Rev. W. W. Rull', ot the Presbyterian Church, and Rev. Philip Johnson, of the Christian Church, pariici- . pated. There was a good congregation in | attendance, but not so large as the occa? sion demanded or as the excellent char acter of the services deserved. The sei - men was preached by Rev. W. L. Wayts, and was a forcible and interesting presen? tation of the inany reasons why the j American people should give thanks unto the Lord for the many anil wonderful marks of his favor to our people as a na? tion. Mr. Wayts is an earnest and faith? ful preacher, full of patriotism and love for hie country. The music was furnished , by the choir of the Christian church, as? sisted by members of the other church , choirs of the town. Miss Mamie Stone presided at the organ. The usual collect- ? ion for the poor was taken up and a fairly good sum was realized. At night, at 7 o'clock, in theiPresbyterian church the Westminster League and Christian Endeavors held a union meet ing, which .was attended by an audience that about filled the house. The pro* gramme was made up of musical select? ions, vocal and instrumental; readings, an essay and an address. It was a very interesting entertainment, and was heartily enjoyed by every one present. Among the numbers on the programme that received hearty commendations from the audience were : The reading by Mis* Ella Buwen of "Under My Study Ijinip" which was contributed by Rev. T. DeWitt Talmage to the Thanksgiving number of the lilies H me Journal in November, 1891; the Essay "The Spirit Child" which was read by Mi.s Annie Wingo; the vocal duett sung by Mls. J. B. Boy er and Miss Pansy Alexander; the violin solo by Mr. Will Henry Aldeison; the reading of a short but pretty etory by Mi;s Maggie Witten; the short address by Mr. Aubrey Watkuis; and the splendid an? them rendered by the choir at the close of the service. Miss Alice Alexander pre? sided at the organ, and the choir was composed of the Presbyterian choir, and members of the other church choirs in the town. 

PRINCE OF WALES' PICTURE. Received by Judge Duke in Recognition of Masons' Invitation. Richmond, Va., Dec. 2.?Judge R. T. W. Duke, of Charlotlesville, grand mas? ter oi Masons of Virginia, has received from the Prince of Wales a photograph of his Royal Highness, with autograph, in recognition of Judge Duke's invitation to the Prince to take part in the ceremonies at Mount Vernon on the one hiindreth anniversary of Washington's death. The Earl' of 1-ondesborough, pust grand senior warden of England, and the officere of Constitutional Lodge, No. 2tl4. of Beverly, East Yorkshire, have sent a wreath of oak and evergreen from Ixm desborough Paik to be placed on Wash ington'S tomb on the occasion, und Canon Richard Weeton, of York, who is Chap? lain to the lvtri of Londesborough, has sent some verses to be read during the ceremonies. Missionary Meeting. On next Sunday night the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society will hold a meeting in the Methodist church, the regu? lar services by the pastor being dispensed with. The eiitertainment will be under the direction of Mrs. O'Keeffe, who is an enthusiastic and earnest worker in the cause of Missions. A nice programme, consisting of vucal and instrumental music, pautomimee, recitatious &c, has been pre? pared. Mr. Will Henry Aldersou will as? sist with his violin. We have no doubt the entertainment will be an enjoyable one and cannot help believing that a large crowd will attend. Five Generations.

CONGRESS IS NOW IN SESSION. Scenes About the National Capital and Many Familiar Faces That Are Missing. MR. ROBERTS NOT SWORN IN. Oath of Office Will Not be Administered to Utah Representative Until the Charges in Connection With Alleg? ed Polygamous Practices Are Investigated. Washington, Dec. 4.?All was bustle and excitement about the Capitol this morning in anticipation of the opening at noon of the first session of the Fifty-Sixth congress. The members of both houses were early putting in an appearance, and as the members of the lower house gather? ed in the cloak room and on the Moor of the chamber there was a free interchange of congratulations betw een those who are entering upon their second, third or fourth terms, and a general levee for the infor? mal introduction of tbe new members. There were many new faces to be seen in the House and more than the usual number of familiar personages were miss? ing. As the old time member glanced at the seats so many years filled by Dingley, McMillan, Stone of Pennsylvania, Bland, Dockery and Savers, and found them oc? cupied by new men he realized that many old and honored landmarks have been obliterated. The oath of offics ivas not administered to Mr. Roberts, of Utah, and will not be jntil after charges in connection with his dleged polygamous practices have been nvestigated by a special committee. The new member in the Senate who probably attracted most attention was Senator Beveridge, of Indiana, who was kept busy from the moment he made his ippearanee in the ante room until the noon hour in making the acquaintance of chose of his colleagues whom he had not met before. Intense interest is manifested concern ing the President's message to Congress, ?Specially in view of the semi-authoritative uuiouncemente that he will clearly outline the future policy of the government in dealing with the Cuban and Philippine problems and the ether vital questions with which the nation is most concerned. The message will not be presented until tomorrow, as the Senate upon assembling at noon today immediately took an ad? journment until tomorrow morning out of respect to the memory of the late Vice President. The message has been in type *ince be Tore Thanksgiving, but more than the usual precautions have been taken to pre? vent the premature leaking of any portion of its contents or a general lesume of it as it whole, and so far these precautions have been effectual. THE 

KENTUCKY QUESTION. Can the State Board Go Behind the Returrs ? Frankfort, Ky., December 5.?The | State Board of Flection Commissioners,! silting as a canvassing board, finished its j work at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and to? morrow at 11 o'clock the members will sit in the State Senate chamber as a con? testing hoard to hear arguments in tbe ca^es of eleven contested counties. The first great fight will come lip on the question of whether or not the board has the light to go behind the certitied re? turns filed with the Secretary of State by the different counties. Upon the issue of the argument on this point will rest the name of next governor of Kentucky. On the face of the returns now on file with the Secretary of State, Mr. Taylor has a plurality of 2,3813, his total vote being 193,514, against 191,331 for Goebel. If there is to be "no going behind" the returns, the board will have no option but to issue the certificate of election to Taylor. If the board decides that it bus the power to go behind the returns, there is no tellinr who will receive the certifi gate. It will depend entirely upon the results of contests to be decided before the board, and the matter will without doubt be cairied for final settlement to the State Legislature, which meets next month. Turner?Bowen. Port Royal, Va., Nov. 30.?One of the most beautiful home weddings ever wit? nessed in this vicinity was solemnized at the home of the bride's grandmother, Mrs. J. J. Gravatt, Wednesday morning, the contracting parties being Mr. George Turner, Jr., formerly of Port Conway, Va., now of Washington, and Miss Mary Cary Bowen. The ceremony was perform? ed by the bride's uncle, the Right Rev. W. L. Giavatt, bishop coadjutor of West Virginia, assisted by the Rev. S. S. Ware. The bride came in on the arm of the groom, and was given away by her mother, Mrs. L. J. Bowen. The room in which, the ceremony was performed was beautifully decorated with evergreens and chrysanthemums. Immediately after the ceremony an elaborate wedding break? fast was served, after which the happy couple left for the North. Only the immediate families and near friends witnessed the ceremony, among the number being Mr. and Mrs. George Turner, Sr., father and mother of the groom; Mrs. J. J. Gravatt, Mrs. L. J. Bowen, Right Rev. W. L. Gravait, Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Turner, Rev. and Mrs. S. S Ware, Miss F. B. Robb, Miss S. J. Peyton, Miss M. B. < >iesenberry, Mr. W. T. Pratt and Mr. ? V. Turner. The bride is a daughter of the late G?n. Rees T. Bowen, who represented the Ninth district of Virginia in Congress at one lime.?Norfo'k Morning Herald, 5WELL, VA., TH?RS A Very Sad Death. After a dangerous illness of about one week, Mrs. Howard Edgar Hurt, wife of Mr. James F. Hurt, died at her home in 1 Tazewell, on Sunday afternoon, Dec. 3rd, 1899.. For several days with her family and friends there had been alternate I periods of hope and despair as to the re ' sultofher sickness; but on Sunday morn? ing the sorrowful intelligence was borne over the town that Mrs. Hurt was failing rapidly, and very soon thereafter came the word that Bhe was dead. The deceased, who was Miss Howard Edgar Ratliff previous to her marriage, was born near Kichlande, in this county, on May 30th, 18(59; and was married to Mr. James F. Hurt on March 20th, 1889. She is survived by her mother, husband and four daughters, the youngest child j being an infant about three weeks old. When a young girl Mrs. Hurt made a profession of religion and united with the M. E. Church, South, and has ever since been a zealous, faithful and consistent member of the Church. On Tuesday afternoon funeral services were held in the Methodist church, con? ducted by Rev. J S. French, pastor, who was assisted by Revs. W. W. Run", W. L. Wayts and Philip Johnson. The remarks of Mr. French were not only full of conso? lation to the bereaved ones, but were a beautiful tribute to the Christian charact? er of the deceased. At the conclusion of the services at the church the remains were taken to the old cemetery and Jaid to rest. Both at tiie church and the grave there was a large crowd of sympathising and sorrowing friends of the family. The active pall bearers were: Dr. James O'Keelle, Capt. A. J. Tynes, and Messrs. John S. Bottimore, Win. C. Pen dleton, W. 0. Young, L. C. Wingo and J. N. Harm an. The honorary pall bear? ers were Messrs. Geo. W. Gillespie, Geo. Buston, J. D. Alexander, Henry Preston and J. W. Chapman. No sadder death has occurred in Taze? well since we have been a resident of the place, and we extend our deepest sympa? thy to the sorrowing mother, husband and little children. 

LIEUT. MUNRO'S BLUFF. Captured Eight Hundred Filipinos And a General. Manila, December 2.?6 p. m.?The capture by Lieutenant Munro and fifty men of the Fourth Cavalry of the Filipino General Conon with eight hundred officers and men with rifles, eeveral Americans and 70 Spanish prisoners at Bayanibong, provice of Nueva Viecaya, was a successful bluff. Lieutenant Munro tapped thetebel wire, telegraphed to Conon that he was advancing with a large force and demand? ed bis surrender. After negotiations Co? non consented to capitulate to a "superior force," whereupon Lieutenant Munro telegraphed that he would enter the town with a small guard and receive the garri? son's surrender. He captured the whole Filipino force and secured their arms, the rebels supposing Munro had an army be? hind him. Washington, December 2.?General Otis informed the War Department today of the surrender of Bayonbcng in the follow? ing dispatch : "Manila, December 2.?Reported that Bayonbong was, with province of Nueva Viscaya, surrendered .November 28 to Lieutenant Munro, where the cavalry, who commanded advance scouts on Carranga lan train, consisting of 50 men, 40 cavalry and three native scouts.

Richlands News. Rev. Sullivan will preach here next Sun? day at 11 a. m. Mrs. George Bruster is very sick; not expected to live. Mr. J. M. Cochran has been unwell for several days. He is some better now. It is cold this morning, nnd plenty of suow. It looks like we will have a white Christmas. Rev. Crumley will hold quarterly meet at Bandy's Chapel next Saturday and Sun? day, December 9th and 10th. The good people had a Box Supper here last Saturday night. There was v good sum of money made up, which goes to the support of the pastor of the M. E. Church, Rev. J. F. Campbell. Revs. Crumley and Campbell say they are for Gen. James A. Walker being seated in Congress, and President Win. McKin? ley being President another four years. They say when the hat goes around, it comes back with money in it. Prosperity hits come, business flourishing and prices good. Mr. John M. Jones, who attended meet? ing here last Sunday night, was coining up the railroad from church and accidently fell off the abutment about six feet into a pond of water and came out wet all over. He said he was baptized, but he baptized himself. He sprained his ankle, and went off limping, and will watch that pond of water from now on. I think so. Rev. T. J. Crumley, presiding elder, preached at Richlands last night to a good congregation. His eermon was eood and enjoyed by all. He also held quarterly meeting at Gray's Branch last Saturday and Sunday. There was a large crowd present; numbers could not get in the house. The Elder's sermon was highly complimented by the people. One man who gave liberally to the collection said : "1 am willing to help pay for such preach? ing as that." One joined the M. E. Church here Sunday night. Dec. 4th, 1899. Correspondent.

DECEMBER 7 FIERCE BATTLE AT MODDER RIYER The Boers Occupied a Strongly Intrench? ed Position and Fought Hard. BRITISH SIMPLY MOWED DOWN. Though It Seemed Almost Impossible to Live Through the Terrible Fire the Brave British Did Not Retreat and Finally Carried The Day Against Odds. London, Dec. 5.?Details of the battle j on Modder river show that the guards charged 8,000 Boer rifles and finally cross? ed the river. The enemy occupied a | strong position, entrenched, their front extending five miles along the bank of the stream; were well supplied with artillery, and fought desperately. In the opinion of the staff there has never been such a sustained fire in the annals of the British army as the troo|>s had to face at the Modder river- The British had no cover whatever, and were simply mowed down. It seemed impossi? ble to live through the terrible fire, but the brave feliows did not retreat an inch and finally carried the day. The Boer fire was very accurate, and they must have numbered ten thousand. The Highlanders made several attempts to force the river, but were exposed to such a murderous, enfilading fire that they retired after suffering terribly. Sub? sequently a part of the guard got over and held their own for hours against a vastly superior force. Circuit Court. Judge Jackson arrived at Tazewell on the noon train last Monday, and opened circuit court that afternoon. The time of | the court, so far, has been chiefly occupied with chancery causes. The case of Hylton vs. Norfolk and Western Railway Co., was taken up yesterday, and is now being tried. This case has been tried three times before this, and each time resulted in a hung iury. It is a damage suit for an injury claimed to have been sustained by the plaintiff on a train of the Company, at Pocahontas. The case has been prosecuted with great persistency by Williams it Hicks for the plaintiff, and defended with e(|ual persistency by May, May & Smith for the defendant. It is thought that the term will not be a very long one, that few law cases will be tried, but a good many decrees will be entered in chancery causes. The Altogether.

We expect Bryan would like to recall that telegram of congratulation he sent to Goebel after the Kentucky election. From the pictures of a number of mem? bers of thj Virginia Legislature, printed in the Richmond papers, we are indiueJ to think it will be not only an inexperi? enced body but of meagre ability. The Florida Times (Dem.) asks the question : "What has Dewey done?" One of the most sensible things he has done was declining to let the Democrats use him as their candidate for President. The editor of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and the editor of the Richmond News are saying some pretty warm things about each other. They are now both ardent supporters of Bryan Democracy and both have a peculiar recent record. The editor of the Virginian-Pijot a few years ago was an ardent Mabone Republican, and the editor of the News in 1896 was secretary of the Palmer and Buckuer State Committee. They are now fusssing to decide which is the greatest flopper. Paint Your Buggy for 75 Cents with Devoe Gloss Carriage Paint, ready for use; 8 colors. Gives a high gloss, equal to new. Sold by Jno E. Jackeon. How McKinley and Bryan Are Viewed Abroad. London "Chronicle."I We must admit that the failure of Presi? dent McKinley to secure a second term of office appears to us, under the c~"um stances, as all but inconceivable. The American nation, more by natural evolu? tion than by personal caprice or party am? bition, finds itself endowed with a colonial empire, an international policy, a scheme of diplomacy overlapping tbe historical diplomacies of the Old World. We do not believe that our trans-Atlantic cousins will close their eyes to these all-important facts, or that they will repudiate the vast responsibilities which have been imposed upon them by their national and inevita? ble growth. The stultification implied in the election of Mr. Bryan, or any other candidate who might stand in opposition to Mr. McKinley, would be enormous. We do not believe it to be possible. And we cannot, therefore, be surprised that the omens of the November elections, so tar as they are known to us, point to the success of the Republican candidate twelve months hence. 145 Years of successful business in paint?Devoe ia the best paint in existence.
